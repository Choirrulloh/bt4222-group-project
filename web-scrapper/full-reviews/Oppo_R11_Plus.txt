After going around the rumor mill for quite some time, the OPPO R11 and R11 Plus finally goes official. With this new R-line, the selfie-centric Chinese brand is finally taking the primary camera more seriously.. OPPO R11 and R11 Plus different from its cousins? The answer can be seen at the back of the new devices — the dual camera setup. However, this isn’t the first time that OPPO is using two cameras pointing in the same direction. Both the OPPO F3 and F3 Plus. already have it, but they were placed at the front — meant to take selfies and groufies.. Both the R11 models will sport a 16-megapixel camera and an extra 20-megapixel sensor with a 2x magnification telephoto lens. This is the same implementation that Apple did on the dual camera found on the iPhone 7 Plus. Other than the optical zoom function, OPPO could have gone with a wide-angle lens for its second rear camera for a more practical and artistic look. — something that the likes of the LG G6 can do.. The cameras will be backed by the Qualcomm Spectra ISP that’s handling the image processing behind the scenes. And speaking of Qualcomm, the OPPO R11 and R11 Plus are one of the few smartphones to ever sport Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 660 SoC.. The new processor from Qualcomm promises high-end performance despite the midrange pricing. And if history taught us something, this new Snapdragon processor will definitely have faster performance and better power efficiency. Whatever the case, it is still a big win for the consumers.. Thankfully, the OPPO R11 and R11 Plus will be running on the latest Android 7.1.1 Nougat. Now, if only they can port that to their current F3 and F3 Plus handsets who are still on Android Marshmallow, everybody would be happy.. The duo will have the same 1080p display resolution despite the difference in size. The R11 has a 5.5-inch screen, while its bigger brother is a 6-incher. Both will also sport a fingerprint scanner and VOOC fast charging. Both features were already featured in previous OPPO flagships that we have reviewed , and they performed incredibly well.. But probably one disappointing feature of the R11 and R11 Plus is the design itself. It still has the same all-metal, unibody look that we have seen since last year’s OPPO F1s. It also looks like a carbon copy of other Chinese-made smartphones like the Vivo V5s .. OPPO might have tweaked the design a little for the R11 and R11 Plus, but it still looks familiar at first glance. The back edges is now more rounded, the antenna bands are now at the top looking like a crown (and seriously identical to the iPhone 7). But even so, the familiar look still lingers.. A Chinese online retailer called JD.com has the OPPO R11 (4GB RAM/64GB ROM model) on pre-order registration for CNY2,999 (around Php21,800). And in just 3 days, there were already 500k people who signed up.. OPPO’s official pricing of the two devices are listed below:. If the numbers were actually true, then the OPPO R11 and R11 Plus could bring another huge milestone for the company. As of now, there’s no mention of global availability. We’ll update this post when we get information about the release date in the Philippines..

OPPO certainly isn’t a name we hear very often in the West. Travel pretty much anywhere in China, however, and you’ll be amazed at just how much you see the italicized green logo.. By listening closely to their fan base, OPPO has repeatedly delivered experiences that Chinese users want. OPPO’s products have not only been consistently well built, but they’ve also been very much inspired by the Apple iPhone in both hardware and software design.. OPPO announces the R11 smartphone in China. OPPO has been dominating the Chinese market for a while now, and today it's aiming to continue this reign with the introduction of the OPPO R11Â. The R11 is utilizing an Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 â¦. OPPO may not have the same level of brand recognition in the West as Huawei or ZTE, but they've long dominated the Chinese market. That should come as no surprise too, given their track record â¦. Staying true to form, OPPO has just released the R11. This is the follow-up to the R9s, a smartphone we reviewed and praised for its camera earlier this year. The OPPO R9s sold extremely well , beating OPPO’s expectations to become their best-selling smartphone.. So, does the R11 have what it takes to continue the wave made by the R9s? Let’s take a look with our comprehensive OPPO R11 review!. Okay, let’s get this out of the way immediately. Objectively, the OPPO R11 looks a lot like the iPhone 7 Plus. Some of OPPO’s design choices, like the front layout, seem only a bit familiar. Others, like the dual-camera configuration, however, are comically similar to those of Apple.. Much of the criticism relating to the R11's design stems from a cultural misunderstanding. Much of the criticism relating to the R11’s design stems from a cultural misunderstanding. This phone has been catered for the Chinese market, where this design philosophy is viewed positively, almost as a way to pay homage to Apple. After all, the average person likes the iPhone’s design, and the OPPO R11 is a phone for the average person.. That’s not to say that we shouldn’t have an ethical discussion about such practices, but rather that we should try to better understand our own perspectives and how they relate to those of others. If you dislike the OPPO R11 because of its similarities to the iPhone , it probably isn’t for you anyway.. Of course, many have also pointed out the R11’s similarities with the OnePlus 5. Although OPPO and OnePlus share parent company BBK Electronics , OPPO has insisted that they did not collaborate with OnePlus for the R11. Instead, it seems, the two companies merely share some of the same suppliers, which is not uncommon in the Chinese smartphone market.. What’s most important to our critique is the design itself rather than the design philosophy. Overall, the R11’s design is really just a refinement of the R9s’. You’re getting the same premium metal unibody and, perhaps most importantly, the same great build quality. The body is still thin and light as well, at 6.8 mm thick and 150 g.. This time around, the rear is very slightly curved. The curve looks quite nice and, combined with the phone’s protruding side edges, makes the phone slightly easier to hold. In the hand, the R11 is just as premium as it looks. While metal bodies generally translate to a more slippery phone, I never felt that I was going to drop the R11 during the review period.. In the hand, the R11 is just as premium as it looks. Notably, the OPPO R11 has a unique curved antenna line design. Instead of a set of solid antenna lines, there’s a set of two thin lines. We prefer this antenna line design over the R9s’, and appreciate the slight cosmetic differentiation is offers.. As is the case with pretty much every mid-range smartphone, the OPPO R11 does not include any water resistance. It’s clear that this will remain a premium feature for the foreseeable future, so if you consider it a must-have, you’ll need to pay much more for something like the Samsung Galaxy S8 .. Although the capacitive back and multitasking keys are illuminated, the illumination is remarkably dim. This might bother some users at first, but it’s not very difficult to get used to.. Unlike the standard layout, the OPPO R11’s back key is to the right of the home button while the multitasking key is to the left. I personally prefer this layout as it makes it easier to use the back key when holding the phone with one hand.. With that said, OPPO could have avoided any controversy by instead implementing neutral keys and software remapping. Such an implementation would have allowed each user to customize the layout to their liking.. Between these two capacitive buttons is another capacitive button: the home button. While its metallic cutout may suggest a tactile key, this button does not press down. In addition to serving as the home key, this button doubles as an astonishingly quick fingerprint reader which can be used to unlock the phone, launch locked down apps, or view locked down files. The phone’s software allows you to easily customize what gets locked down.. I have personally used dozens of different phones with fingerprint readers and I can confidently say that the OPPO R11’s reader is the quickest I have encountered and is likely the quickest available at the time of writing. A mere tap is enough to authenticate.. The OPPO R11 features a 5.5-inch 1080P display. While not quite quad HD, we can let this lower resolution slide given the R11’s competitive pricing. With that said, if you consider quad HD to be a must-have, you should know that there are similarly priced options out there with quad HD displays.. The colors are super punchy and well saturated. Resolution aside, the OPPO R11’s display looks great. It’s an AMOLED panel, so the colors are super punchy and well saturated. If you have used the OPPO R9s , you’ll find the display very familiar.. Unfortunately, the display’s maximum brightness is still a bit dim. This is especially problematic when using the phone outdoors, as it makes the display difficult to read. It’s fine on most cloudy days, but you definitely won’t be able to comfortably use the R11 on a sunny day at the beach.. Unlike many of its competitors, the OPPO R11 does not include an always on display feature. This is odd as the AMOLED panel on the R11 would allow for virtually nonexistent battery drain. It’s probably not a deal-breaker for most, but it’s something to consider when weighing this against other options.. Another area of concern is the R11’s lack of a proper oleophobic coating. This essentially makes the display a fingerprint magnet. The R9s has this same exact issue , so it is disheartening to see OPPO make the same mistake once again.. None of the R11's main competitors make this compromise. While we understand the need to cut costs in a mid-range device, none of the R11’s main competitors make this compromise. Coming from virtually any other device, this issue can be infuriating as fingerprints collect easily but are not easily removed.. OPPO states that the R11 offers 20% faster CPU performance and 30% faster GPU performance from the R9s. This is because of an upgrade from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660. The Snapdragon 660 platform also includes the 14-bit Spectra 160 ISP, which is a first for Qualcomm’s 600 series and is important for processing images taken with the high-resolution camera.. Performance is easy to get used to at the very least. It’s firmly mid-range, unlike much of the “affordable flagship” competition. It can feel a bit sluggish coming from higher-end devices, but it’s not bad by any means. It’s easy to get used to at the very least.. While there is 4 GB of memory, we noticed that the phone’s software memory management is pretty aggressive. Even when using just two or three apps, the system often closed one or two of them in favor of lower memory utilization.. Unsurprisingly, the OPPO R11 is an unlocked dual-SIM smartphone , so you are free to use any two SIM cards simultaneously. This is a really great feature to have if you would like to combine a work and personal phone or travel frequently.. US 4G LTE support is still partial. Surprisingly, the Chinese OPPO R11 variant partially supports US 4G LTE. While some other Chinese smartphones also partially support LTE, this is still very rare for smartphones not intended for the US market. The support is still partial, however, so you won’t always have service where you usually would and carrier aggregation will be limited (i.e., not all available bands will be bonded resulting in limited speeds).. If you’re on AT&T , you can expect support for LTE bands 2, 4, and 5 but not LTE bands 12 and 17. If you’re on T-Mobile , you’ll be able to use LTE bands 2 and 3 but not LTE band 12. The phone is fully compatible with both AT&T’s and T-Mobile’s 3G networks. Please note that although there is support for CDMA networks as well, neither Verizon Â. nor Sprint have certified the R11 for use on their respective networks.. Since AT&T primarily uses LTE band 17 and T-Mobile heavily relies on LTE band 12, we cannot recommend this phone for full-time use in the United States. Regardless, we applaud OPPO for including some US 4G LTE bands.. We imagine the primary goal of including more LTE bands was to improve roaming for global travelers. The R11 even includes the ORoaming app, which allows you to pay for cell phone service by the day in over fifty different countries.. The best part is that all of this happens on the phone, so you don’t need to get a local SIM card. The prices are quite affordable too. You can get one day and 300 MB of unthrottled data for as little as 4.9 RMB in Hong Kong (â$0.72) or just 20 RMB in the US (â$2.95). The app discloses the operator as well, so you won’t be left guessing at how good your service will be.. We’re not sure if this app will make its way to the global variant. Even if it doesn’t, travelers using the Chinese unit are almost certain to love this valuable feature.. Travelers using the Chinese unit are almost certain to love this valuable feature. Like its predecessor, the OPPO R11 does not support NFC. Although it’s not a widely used feature, we would have liked to see it here. If you want to be able to make mobile payments through apps like Android Pay , you will need to look at other options.. The OPPO R11 includes 64 GB of onboard storage and supports microSD card expansion up to 256 GB. You’ll need to give up the second SIM card slot in order to expand the storage. It’s great that OPPO is giving its users the option to expand nonetheless.. We were pleasantly surprised by the OPPO R11’s bottom-firing speaker. It’s moderately loud with minimal distortion, which we don’t always see on smartphones, let alone at this price. While front-facing speakers are still superior, the OPPO R11’s speaker is an above average performer.. The 3.5 mm jack has limited compatibility. For external audio, the R11 includes a 3.5 mm headphone jack. This is nice to have while the transition to USB Type-C audio is being made, as it allows users to use their old accessories. Unfortunately, however, we found that the 3.5 mm jack has limited compatibility.. My personal pair of headphones simply didn’t work when connected to the R11, possibly because the jack is too deep inside the phone. We’ve never had this issue before. If you have a favorite pair of headphones that you plan on using, you’ll need to be okay with the possibility that they may not work.. Unfortunately, we were unable to conduct our usual battery life tests with the OPPO R11. The system hides screen-on time numbers in the settings, so we reverted to a third-party app to keep track of usage. Sadly, the system also blocked this app from running in the background even after locking the app and disabling battery life optimizations.. Because of this, we can only share an anecdotal assessment. The 3,000 mAh battery seems to provide pretty good battery life as we never had trouble getting through a full day with moderate to heavy use. With lighter use, we were able to push the R11’s battery to one and a half to two days of use. This is about average, but we do not have any numbers to share at this time.. OPPO stuck with the outdated microUSB standard for the R11's charging port. Interestingly, OPPO stuck with the outdated microUSB standard for the R11’s charging port. In the past, we have respected this choice as it allows users to use their old chargers instead of making the transition to the newer reversible USB Type-C standard.. However, USB Type-C has been around for nearly two years now, so it is difficult to understand why OPPO has not yet made the switch on their flagship smartphone. As someone who has fully transitioned to Type-C, using the R11 as my daily driver meant often not having the right cable to charge the R11 when outside of home.. Thankfully though, OPPO has implemented their VOOC fast charging technology into the R11. This allows you to charge from 0 to 70 percent in just thirty minutes and to 100 percent in just sixty five minutes. That’s one of the fastest charging rates available today.. The cameras are the unmistakably highlight of the OPPO R11. For the rear, we’re looking at a dual-camera setup. The secondary camera has a longer focal length and effectively offers a 2x optical zoom from the primary camera. The primary camera is a 16 MP Sony IMX398 sensor with an f/1.7 aperture. On the other hand, the secondary camera is a 20 MP Sony IMX376 sensor with an f/2.6 aperture.. That sounds like a pretty beefy setup on paper, but we all know how great camera specs don’t necessarily translate to great camera performance. Image processing is a very important piece to the puzzle. Thankfully, OPPO made sure to pay careful attention to this detail by working with Qualcomm on a platform level.. In our experience, the R11's cameras live up to the hype. In our experience, the R11’s cameras live up to the hype. Images produced in good lighting were sharp, had accurate colors, and exhibited excellent dynamic range. Even when we took an image with the sun in the background, the R11 was still able to capture a good amount of detail in the shadows.. Images taken at 2x zoom were of about equal quality. The software processing is noticeably slower at about three to four seconds, however, as the phone has to combine the images taken by both cameras in order to produce the zoomed in image. We hope that OPPO will focus on improving the image processing speed of telephoto capture in future iterations.. In addition to offering some optical zoom, the dual-camera configuration also allows a hardware/software hybrid depth effect. The depth effect is activated when shooting with the rear cameras in portrait mode. Pictures taken with the depth effect on had fairly convincing bokeh. The mode is not perfect with the edges, especially when lighting isn’t perfect, but the images are still generally good enough for sharing on social media.. When we took the R11 out at night, we noticed the cameras struggle a bit. Images expectedly become soft and noisy as the phone had to deal with significantly less amounts of light. We noticed a lot of lens flare too, especially with the secondary camera. On the plus side, color reproduction is still decent and images aren’t rendered as overly dark.. Overall, low-light images aren’t as impressive as those taken in ideal lighting conditions, but they still pack a fair punch when considering the phone’s price. We hope that OPPO will consider adding optical image stabilization (OIS) in a future iteration, as that would seem to help a tad by allowing for longer shutter speeds.. Video capture goes all the way up to 4K for the rear cameras, but the lack of OIS results in a picture that isn’t stabilized on the hardware level, so footage can look a bit shaky, especially at 2x zoom. Video quality itself is pretty good, although not exceptional.. The front-facing camera can also be used to capture video at up to 1080P. This is nice as some front-facing cameras are limited to 720P capture. Video quality with the front-facing camera is also pretty good.. For stills, the front-facing camera is a whopping 20 MP f/2.0 shooter and OPPO states that they treated it as important as the rear cameras. It produces very nice, detailed selfies, as you can see above. When shooting in portrait mode, an optional software beauty filter is added. This filter essentially smoothens and whitens your skin to “make you look more natural.” The six-level scale allows you to adjust the filter’s intensity to your liking.. The built-in camera app on the OPPO R11 provides an easy-to-use yet powerful interface. The built-in camera app on the OPPO R11 provides an easy-to-use yet powerful interface. You can tap the zoom icon to toggle between 1x and 2x zoom or you can slide along the icon to make smaller adjustments to the zoom. General controls including flash, HDR, timer, frame size, and filters are available from the top of the screen.. There is also an expert mode, which allows you to toggle between the rear cameras as well as change basic settings like white balance, ISO, and shutter speed. It provides a nice set of controls which we’re sure will satisfy most smartphone photographers.. Although the OPPO R11 runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box, OPPO’s ColorOS 3.1 skin quite frankly makes the experience feel closer to iOS. The notification panel toggles have been replaced with a control center, the system apps use many design elements from iOS, and some features have been blatantly copied over. It’s a clear clone of AirPlay, down to the triangle in the logo.. To be clear, we understand OPPO’s reasoning for copying Apple’s software. Many Chinese skins use elements of iOS, but some do so better than others. Unfortunately, OPPO’s ColorOS just isn’t one of those skins. It feels as if the focus was placed on cloning rather than developing a great user experience.. The focus was placed on cloning rather than developing a great user experience. Unlike pretty much every Android skin out there, you can’t swipe right to dismiss them. Instead, you have to swipe left and then press “delete.” This is annoying as clearing a single notification takes two steps. There’s not a separate view in the notification panel that would prevent right swipes like there is in iOS, so this feels like an odd choice from a user experience perspective.. Speaking of notifications: we could not get our Chinese unit to send any from third-party apps. Every non-OPPO app from Hangouts to Slack did not send notifications. Even after enabling notifications for each app (they are disabled by default) and disabling all three levels of battery life optimizations (“Background Freeze,” “Abnormal Apps Optimization,” and “Doze”), we still could not receive any notifications.. In order to receive notifications, it appears that the screen must be on with the app either open in the foreground or locked in the background. Once the screen is off, notifications do not come through. As of the time of writing, our R11 unit is on the latest firmware. We hope that this issue will be fixed very soon as notifications are a critical feature of modern smartphones.. There are also a bunch of minor annoyances placed throughout ColorOS. You can only adjust one audio profile at once, a swipe down from the launcher brings up a search screen instead of the notification panel, and the system is constantly showing pop-ups to enable simple per-app permissions like mobile data use.. If you do decide to import a Chinese unit, please also keep in mind that Google services do not come pre-installed. This is perfectly normal for Chinese smartphones, as Google is blocked in China. It is fairly easy to install Google services directly from OPPO’s App Market, but it is not an official installation. For the best experience, you should instead purchase a global model.. Of course, there are still some positive aspects of ColorOS. The added security features, although done before , are a really nice touch as they genuinely make the user experience better.. Overall though, ColorOS doesn’t do anything very interesting and weakens the Android experience rather than strengthening it. The ColorOS user experience simply doesn’t match the quality that we expect from an Android skin.. You can now purchase the OPPO R11 in China for 2999 RMB (â$442). Color options include gold, rose gold, and black. We expect global availability to be announced very soon. Pricing and color options outside of China were unclear at the time of writing.. If you are looking for something larger, OPPO is also offering the OPPO R11 Plus. It’s essentially an R11, but with a 6.0-inch display, 6 GB of RAM, and a 4000 mAh battery.. The OPPO R11 has a lot going for it. It has great cameras, a premium all-metal design, and good battery life. For much of OPPO’s audience, these are the vital components of a good smartphone. For those buyers, the R11 may be a good choice.. With that said, the number of compromises that the R11 brings prevents us from recommending it to a global audience. The software user experience is poor, performance is only mediocre, and there are many small issues. On its own, this would seem acceptable given the R11’s affordable pricing.. We recommend that you go with the OnePlus 5 instead. This is a very competitive segment of the larger smartphone market. We recommend that you go with the OnePlus 5 instead, as it offers the same great cameras, a nearly identical design, much better software, and faster performance. While it is slightly more expensive at $479, we believe that it provides a significantly better value for global users.. There you have it — our deep dive into the OPPO R11!

Mobiles / Oppo Mobile Phones / Oppo R11 Plus Price in India. User Visits: 202 Compare. The Chinese handset maker, OPPO is largely known for a smartphone lineup, which comprises mostly of camera centric smartphones. The brand has now added yet another powerful camera phone to its line called OPPO R11 Plus. Apart from the cameras, the handset also comes with a lot of features to its credit. Here is a brief overview of the handset for those who are on a hunt for a camera phone and are still undecided.. The brand itself is synonymous to selfie and has a self-proclaimed tag of Selfie Expert, which is a testament to its selfie prowess. In the case of OPPO R11 Plus, the handset gets a beefy 20-megapixels camera above the display. The camera is bound to delight selfie lovers and produces sharp, detailed images.. While the front camera does take the spotlight, the rear camera is the end game most of us will be the rear camera. The OPPO R11 Plus comes with a dual camera module on the back that has a combination of 20MP + 16MP lens for good imaging performance. Moreover, the rear camera is accompanied by LED flash for low light capturing.. Every smartphone user would agree when we say that however powerful your phone might, it doesn’t mean anything unless it has a powerful battery backing it up. It doesn’t really adds up when you can do so much with your phone but have to hunt for the charger atleast twice a day. You will not face the same issue with the OPPO R11 Plus as it comes with a powerful 4,000mAh battery with fast charging.. The Hybrid SIM slot is one of the biggest gripe smartphone users have with most phones these days and OPPO R11 Plus features the same. This means to be able to use the expandable storage, you will have to let go of the secondary SIM slot, which would be a deal breaker for those who use dual SIM connectivity.. There is no two thoughts about the fact that the handset is a delight to use for those who love to pursue their love for photography on phone. However, if performance is your main priority, there are much better handsets from the likes of Samsung and OnePlus are available.. 35,990 (Expected Price) Oppo R11 Plus is currently not available in any online store..

OPPO R11 Plus comes with 2x tele dual-cam. OPPO R11 Plus comes with 2x tele dual-cam. Wide angle camera with 16MP Sony IMX398 1/2.8" sensor and f/1.7 aperture. Telephoto camera with 20MP Sony IMX350 sensor with f/2.6 aperture. 20MP front camera with F2.0 aperture. Back at the Mobile World Congress in February Chinese Manufacturer OPPO was demonstrating a smartphone camera module with a 5x optical zoom that was developed in cooperation with the Israeli company CorePhotonics. This technology still has not made it into a production device but today the company has launched the R11 Plus which features a dual-cam with 2x zoom factor and all around impressive camera specifications.. The main lens is coupled with a 16MP Sony IMX398 1/2.8" sensor and a fast f/1.7 aperture. The telephoto module features a 20MP Sony IMX350 sensor with f/2.6 aperture. The Qualcomm image signal processor applies image fusion algorithms and offers a background-blurring portrait mode, similar to what we've seen on the iPhone 7 Plus or the Xiaomi Mi6. 4K video recording is possible with both cameras. The front camera has a 20MP sensor and F2.0 aperture.. Other specifications include a 6" 1080p AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chipset and a 4,000mAh battery, all wrapped up in a metal unibody. No information on launch data and pricing has been revealed yet.. Tags: mobile , android , oppo. 20MP Sony IMX350 sensor with f/2.6 aperture wow nice mega pixel... Where can i buy this phone. All of them have no OIS... = = Could some one tell me how to shot clearly.... With a high shutter speed and smart stacking algorithms. Some of the best smartphone cameras don't have IS. They just take multiple shots with a high shutter speed and align those for noise reduction.. I have the oppo R7plus and build quality has been amazing. Slightly annoying they don't update their phones so you may get more upgrades with xiaomi or apple. That said, oppo build quality, performance, battery life and camera are great. VOOC charging is super fast but needs the oppo cable & charger so I would prefer fast charge in phone like qualcom.. in China official Oppo shop announced it, but still now there is no price.... Not sure whether this is true, but the IMX 350 might be a 1/2.8" sensor as well. This would be the smartphone tele (prime lens) camera with the largest sensor (Apple 7 Plus, Xiaomi Mi 6 and Asus 3 Zoom use 1/3.6" sensors for the tele cam). The focal length of the tele lens is 5.47mm..... @noisephotographer The IMX350 is a 1/2.8" sensor @1400700226 where did you get that info? This would result in a focal length of 37mm and explain the unusual large telephoto sensor.. So the smartphone has probably a 24mm-37mm combo. Not the 28mm-55mm of the Apple 7 Plus, Xiaomi Mi 6.. No, 24-37 does not make sense as it's 2x zoom. Moreover according to the exif data of the wide angle camera the focal length is 4.27mm which would be a 29mm field of view (I couldn't find tele samples with exif data). Here are some samples with Exif. @noisephotographer & @140070026 This proves my point. The EXIF shows 4.27mm (25mm equiv) for the wide angle and 5.57mm (32mm equiv) for the tele lens. So it's not a true 2x zoom and probably uses an additional digital zoom. This is also supported by the fact that both images have 16MP. But the tele should have 20.. According to gsmarena the first sensor is the imx 398 and the second sensor is an imx 376. These are both 1/2.8" sensors according to wikipedia... So if the exif data are correct (which is not always the case) we only get ≈28.5mm - 37.0mm zoom = 1.3x zoom If we assume that the tele lens is very sharp and that they use multi frame noise reduction for the cropping, then the difference between 20megapixels and 16 megapixels would only contribute 1.1x zoom in good lighting conditions. So as a whole ≈ 1.45x zoom. So I guess that either the second sensor is not a 1/2.8" sensor or the exif data are wrong or it's a sophisticated multi frame algorithm.. And by the way: If they crop a 16 megapixels image from the 20 megapixels 1/2.8" sensor, then the tele camera would only use an area of 16 mm² which would be equivalent to ≈ 1/3.1" sensor.
