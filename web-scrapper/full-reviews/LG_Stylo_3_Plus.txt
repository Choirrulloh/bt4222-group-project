Phone has everything the top of the line samsung phone has at 1/3 price. Thank you for a great product.. Rated 5 out of. Haven't had a bit of trouble so far. The stylus is great for writing notes. For a lower budget phone it's great.. Rated 5 out of. I bought this at the Costco kiosk a few weeks ago; my wife bought another brand. I am loving this phone! I use the fingerprint technology to access it but love that it also has a security password feature so my wife can access it if needed (no secrets from her). The phone definitely does all I need it to plus a lot more!. Rated 5 out of. An upgrade to my iPhone 6s - Awesome phone!. I've had this phone just over 5 months and have found absolutely no down-side to it so far. I would be considered a power user; - I log 3,000 to 4,000 minutes monthly, probably close to 2,000 text messages and, on account of its size, use it as an e-reader often, especially when out on service calls and looking up documentation. Will definitely buy a Stylo 4 Plus if/when they come out!?!?!??. Rated 5 out of. They give this phone for Christmas as an upgrade from my LG K7 and it's an amazing device it's fast and snappy really good battery life compared to my old phone that in one hour of Facebook it was already at 50% and I had to charge it half way trough the day and I had be with a charger of the anxiety of been without charge with this phone I can be relax because at the end of the day I would still have 50% or 20% left. The performance is quite decent I have used DS emulators without an issue the camera needs some better software for focusing better since sometimes the phone doesn't focus well but oh well I don't use the camera much so not a big deal for me. For the storage this phone is also awesome with my old phone I had to delete 3 apps in order to install one due to its 8 GB storage that the system takes half of it so in reality it's like 4GB with the LG stylo 3 plus I don't have that problem even with the system taking some space I can install alll the apps I want with the 22GB I have left to use. Rated 1 out of. I bought this smartphone last week, I try to return it, but company did not allowed it. Nothing in the smartphone is good, camera is the worst thing, it is really, really bad. The pen has not sense for me, it only allow you to draw in a small size in the notes. I just threw this smartphone in the trash.. Rated 5 out of. Amazing phone love the stylus, camera, memory, etc. Has everything big phones have but only $700 cheaper. Does it have silly features to to make it a $860 phone, no. But it does have a sophisticated stylus that works. And it's solid, fast, great screen size and 1080, replaceable battery (that should be a basic feature forever) lasts all day no matter how much use. Camera solid, videos great, GPS great, works all the time. Wire charger should be a basic for life or have the option but always keep it simple for the majority of the world is the way to go. I Got a spare battery for $10, a case for $5, a wallet case for $6, Screen protector for $2, quick charge cable for $10. Iphone, no cable charge phones are a fortune. My kids had the latest greatest phones but mine is as fast plus has the stylus that I use all the time for work and home. Now they want mine for Christmas. Why LG makes A V30 and a G6 is bizarre. If they marketed this phone and added a bit more ram memory and faster processor (i can wait for the next gen), they could dump their expensive R&D and go with this phone for the rest of the planet. This phone should be the Honda Accord of the phone industry, not the iphone. Reliable standard features that keep the costs down. Upgrade every 2-3 years you should have a customer base forever. Why they don't market the heck out of it, is beyond me.. Rated 5 out of. Since leaving galaxy I've had every stylo since G stylo. Great series of phone for the price, though the battery has gotten weaker it gained fast charging. The screen is a nice 5.7 of FHD. 32g of memory and 2g of ram. The phone isn't the fastest but definitely is up there with top tier phones. I've had no problem with streaming or downloading large apps that would require wifi or using them. The 13mp autofocus camera can be great at times but less often decent. LG TONE INFINIM® Premium Bluetooth® Wireless Stereo Headset. LG TONE Studio™ Bluetooth® Wearable Personal Speaker Headset.

This phone is basically a Samsung Note 4 with many of the same features for SIGNIFICANTLY less money than a Samsung Note series phone. It's been a good choice for having a stylus, sd card slot and a removable battery, my must haves on a phone. I had a Samsung, I looked around and decided that I wan't going to pay a $1000.00 for a new Samsung phone.

I purchased this phone because my daughter had a Stylo 1 initially the phone seemed okay I bought it in September and it started overheating about 3 weeks ago. I have tried using headphone, using my Wi-Fi so I don't put it close to my ear but it still gets hot. Not good I have over 400 documents for work and pictures I can't get rid of. I tried to download to my computer but I am able to. I am disappointed that this happened.. Rated 3 out of. Great Phone but Camera too slow and bad quality. The speed of the phone is really good but when you use the camera it takes a lot to take pictures and the quality is bad...hope they update it to it can be better. Rated 5 out of. This is the first time ever that I've liked a product so much to take the time to write a review for it. It's basic, easy to use, and great for anyone. It would be especially old people because of its large screen size and since old people have a hard time texting, the stylus makes using the swipe texting feature a lot more efficient. It's a really good phone for a great price.. Rated 3 out of. It broke less than a munth after purchase but had good features. Rated 5 out of. Upset about losing my Stylo2 Plus until I tried 3+. Bought this phone about a week ago - and could not be happier. Really fast and the only thing that I wish it had is wireless charging capabilities. Rated 5 out of. Best phone I have ever had. I was originally going to get the Stylo 2 because it had all that appealed to me. Size, storage, speed, performance, and as a perk it had a stylus and a great camera. A few days before going out to buy the Stylo 2 I heard about the release of a Stylo 3 soon and I read up on it and it was even better than the 2. So when it came out I got it the first day and ever since then this phone has been wonderful in every task I do be it work or fun. The screen has cracked a bit and am planning to get another Stylo 3 soon :). Rated 4 out of. So far I owned this phone for 3 months and have multiple apps and does not slow down the phone. I notice that when the battery is low, that is when it might get slow, but not a deal breaker. Battery is pretty good, love the quick charge. Camera not that great, but again is a mid-range phone, very poor in low light, but average pictures in good light. Love the finger print sensor, works great and works smoothly. Nice to have the stylus, don't use it that much, but is a nice feature to have for the price. I like the design of the phone, feels good on the hand. Will recommend a case since it is kind of slippery.. Rated 4 out of. nice design and need to increase RAM to be 3G to improve performance..

Download our Official Android App: Forums for Android!. Discussion in ' Android Devices ' started by James L , Sep 23, 2017 .. Likes or dislikes about the LG Stylo 3 Plus?. Same as my old Stylo 2 as far as a comfortable screen size. My phone is used 99% for work. I don't play games on my phones usually. I did play Final fantasy new empire something or other, but i kept getting kicked out of every guild... Hey it's my phone and I'm going to attack everyone if i please lol. The fish hook at the end is ugly. Low loudspeaker volume, seems a little louder then the Stylo 2 but still leaves a little to be desired.. malakasinsd619 and omgb1973 like this.. If you have to have a Metro only phone and / or a holdover until spring, especially something NOT SMALL, this is the besting thing right now. Updates have made this a very decent phone. ** for $4-500 you can get G6 Plus or its equivalent from Xiaomi, Huawei, OnePlus. But the timing is a bit off - the Chinese models are waiting updates to fix odd bugs, coupled with imminent arrival of 2 / 3 flagships... Which will trigger lower prices on all these... plus the Chinese brands are not a slam dunk to provide fixes or OS updates. It's this or theTmo Revvl Plus (@ +$$ & no NFC).. It's literally a re-cased Stylo 2 minus the NFC, relocated buttons, no increased RAM (3 GB is almost mandatory for a bloated phone). And the Stylo 2, aside from being a bit more comfy in hand, is a lousy step up. Dual window on Stylo 2 only works with LG and Android system apps, while on Stylo 1 it worked with almost every app I threw at it. I'd love to hear of any more improvements the 3 has over the 2. I never mentioned the 2, it's not available any more here. I come from G Stylo to ZMAX Pro(too many bugs + no updates or root possible) back to Stylo. If you require large screen and storage 2017 did not improve on 2016 already dismal offerings at all price tiers. 3+ is not a super upgrade, but it's a sufficiently upgraded holdover... since there's now a glimmer of hope... between now and February something good at a decent price point should float to the surface. Free Google Storage 100 GB extra 2 Years. Open Google Photos, you'll get 100 added to Drive n Photos. and battery + screen have been pleasant surprises after updates. It's worth keeping / not a waste of money. In the US there's really nothing else out there better, at any even remotely close price, with NFC & reliable software updates, "that is not smaller". Woulda been nice @$99, but then again, paid $250 initially for G Stylo. The reality is that Metro phone selection is abysmal. too bad only got the smaller HTC U11, woulda took the larger one in a heartbeat.. It's literally a re-cased Stylo 2 minus the NFC, relocated buttons, no increased RAM (3 GB is almost mandatory for a bloated phone). And the Stylo 2, aside from being a bit more comfy in hand, is a lousy step up. Dual window on Stylo 2 only works with LG and Android system apps, while on Stylo 1 it worked with almost every app I threw at it. I'd love to hear of any more improvements the 3 has over the 2. How does LG Stylo 3 screen compare to Stylo 2 screen? Is the increase in screen resolution noticeable?. I think theres a difference, but nothing major.. How does LG Stylo 3 screen compare to Stylo 2 screen? Is the increase in screen resolution noticeable?. Any Idea if The Stylo 3{L84VL) screen is compatible with the Stylo 3 +(TP450) ???. I found its actually cheaper to buy this phone instead of paying to replace screen...and strip it for parts...but I really just need new screen. So who knows anything about to see ALL EVEN HIDDEN SPY APPS ON THE PHONE OR DETECT. Do you already have an account?.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Solid. Case fits well enough; except in the top right corner where clearance for pen access is needed, this looks comically unaligned but actually isn't unaligned. I had to reseat the phone in the case a few times before I got used to seeing it, The case actually does have a nice protective corner there, and it's about as rigid as the rest of the case is. Case volume access buttons are nice, wide and very touchy! So they transmit presses very well and this is a very good quality even if I mash the volume buttons accidentally when handling the device in the case! I had no issues connecting my 3.5mm audio to it either, the hole for this jack is nice and wide, as is the access hole for the MicroUSB connection Case has a few points I was worried about but seems reasonably sound and does not add much bulk or weight. Item was packaged very very minimally and very much proclaimed "Made In China" boldly. Simple installation, like the color and overall the case is solid seemingly. For the price, it's very good qualitywise. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Perfect price, it's exactly what I was looking for .... Bought this for my brother's phone, my parents bought him a smartphone for his 10th birthday, but didn't get him a case.... Perfect price, it's exactly what I was looking for but I probably should have gone for the OtterBox or another heavy duty case. He dropped the phone on asphalt and the screen cracked anyways. Most likely because a 10 yr old is not responsible enough to have a cell phone.... 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Didn't protect during a 1 ft fall. Phone fell off lounge chair and this case did NOTHING for a 1 foot fall.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars I was glad to find that the case fits my LG Stylo .... I received the case before its estimated delivery time. I was worried at first that the case would be too bulky and that my phone would not fit in my pocket well. I was glad to find that the case fits my LG Stylo 3 Plus perfectly. It's sleek-looking and has a nice matte-black finish. It's not too bulky, but doesn't seem to have much shock absorption so if you're looking for a super protective case this is probably not the case for you. However if you're just looking for some protection like I was, this case is great.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Love it.... I don't like heavy cases though protection is better. I like light cases that keeps my phone comfortable yet protects against scratches and small dents. This is just what I wanted and the color was great.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars DON'T DO IT!. It doesn't fit my phone, which is a stylo 3 plus. Where the stylus comes out, the phone case is really crooked and I can't get it out. Also the phone case was supposed to be brand new and it came damaged with color missing on the sides. Its also so slippery that when I hold it I am afraid I'm going to drop it. I've had the phone case for 15 minutes and I already bought a new one. I do not recommend this product. Also I ordered a dark purple color and it came to me in an ugly pinkish color.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Doesn't fit. The case is made of cheap looking plastic. Misaligned volume buttons which make it impossible to increase or decrease volume. I wasn't expecting much for $5.00 but at least make the case fit.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Uncomfortable. Case fits fine but the sides where you hold the phone are sharp for some reason, very uncomfortable.. Was this review helpful to you?. I love it and it's very durable.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great. Great case for the price resistant against drops.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great case. I bought this case because of how simple it looked, and it did not disappoint. No kickstands, rubber grip things or glitter, straight and to the point. 5.0 out of 5 stars and it did not disappoint. Got it today...Fits perfectly on my phone...For the price is a great deal...Highly recommended.... 5.0 out of 5 stars Great fit. 1.0 out of 5 stars Crap. The case i received sits loose on the bottom of the phone. Kind of annoying but you get what you pay for i guess. 3.0 out of 5 stars Good enough. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars.

This phone is basically a Samsung Note 4 with many of the same features for SIGNIFICANTLY less money than a Samsung Note series phone.

It's not quite as fast as a fresh note 4, but doesn't have the bad ram issues of that phone either.. I had a Samsung, I looked around and decided that I wan't going to pay a $1000.00 for a new Samsung phone. I saw this LG and took a chance. i have had it for almost a year and have nothing but good things to say about it. It's fast, has a clear screen, has all the features of the Samsung that I used, the battery life is better than my Samsung, has excellent sound and it takes really good pictures.

LG Stylo 3 Plus launching at T-Mobile today, MetroPCS in June. Days after T-Mobile began updating the LG Stylo 2 Plus to Android 7.0, T-Mo has started sales of that phone’s successor.. The LG Stylo 3 Plus is now available from T-Mobile for $9 down and $9 per month for 24 months, or $225 total. You can also pay $0 down and $10 per month if you buy using JUMP! On Demand. The LG Stylo 3 Plus will launch at MetroPCS in June.. When it comes to specs, the LG Stylo 3 Plus runs Android 7.0 on a 5.7-inch 1920×1080 display. It’s got 13-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel front cameras, 32GB of built-in storage, microSD slot, fingerprint reader, 2GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon 435 processor. There’s a 3080mAh battery powering the whole package.. Also included is a stylus along with special software features for the stylus. For example, Screen-Off Memo will let you pull out the stylus and start taking notes on the Stylo 3 Plus’s screen when the display is off.. For a quick preview of the LG Stylo 3 Plus in action, you can watch T-Mobile’s @askdes unboxing below.. Tags: Android , LG , LG Stylo 3 Plus.

I like the fact they included JOD as an option here. All phones should be this way so people can downgrade to save money if they want.. (I understand JOD was made for the higher end phones, but it would be a nice option for many without having to sign up for jump to upgrade early or having to pay their eip off.). WTH,clearing out the parts bin on this one LG?. Overall,looks to be a decent phone that’s priced right,but seriously,MicroUSB?. I think I will wait for the next iteration of the ZTE ZMAX.. Every indication I saw was that it wasn’t getting 1080p screen which is good. A shame not 3GB of Ram, but is nice to have 32GB of storage. Unlike the Zte Zmax Pro, this will more likely get root too.. Man, I wish they would’ve bumped the specs on this one. Would have been a great time to cash in on the folks wanting a galaxy Note like device and still have replaceable battery option.. What do you expect from a sub $250 phone, in all respects this is a really good deal for the price point, especially for a budget/mid tier device.. For the price, it has what I would expect. I was more meaning I wish that LG would have taken the opportunity to make a flagship Stylo device. That would have been awesome to me.. Oh in that case then idk if I would agree to that, not because I wouldnt like the idea, but Sammy has had that market cornered since the Notes inception. I think if the Stylo did have a “pro” version or something to indicate that its far better and LG actually made an effort to advertise those devices other than the flagship G and V line we would see a place in the market for them.. Sammy does have the market but they also took a hit in that market last year. It would have been awesome if LG took advantage of that. But yeah, I hear what you are saying.. The only real spec bump that would have really helped this device is an increase of ram to 3 to 4GB, but that might have increased the price to be $250+ easily.. Huh This is a Stylo Device Dude.. This phone does come with a replaceable battery though. You mean to say that this phone needs to include both Galaxy Note like ways and replaceable battery option. This device has a removable battery. Sorry your statement confused me a little bit there Bud.. I was just thinking it was a Large phone with Stylus and removable battery and that it seemed like a missed opportunity for LG to have bumped the specs and snatched up a few Ex Note customers looking for a hardware refresh.. lol It’s all cool my Dear Friend. The stylo is the same as the stylus. lol In other countries they call it stylus, but out here in USA it’s mainly called the Stylo. lol Hey this phone here does come with Android Nougat 7.0 operating system. Plus upgraded battery voltage, Full HD 1080p video/screening and band 66 spectrum technology.. Agreed,if this phone had 3gig of ram,like my Note 3,i would get it,. If I do get new phone it will unlock one.. I already upgraded from G Stylo to something else already identical or better in all key areas to the Stylo 3. I was eagerly anticipating this v3, since I already maxed out the 32gb…but getting the Stylo 3 would be a step back… from smaller screen to even no USB C. And save for FM radio, there’s really nothing that could be labeled extra or substantially better. There’s not even IR, a pet feature of LG.. I will still get this device due to full HD 1080p video quality/screening. Plus it comes with 32 gb of internet storage, 66 spectrum capabilities, upgraded battery voltages from 2900 amps to 3200 amp voltage. Don’t forget that this is not the LG Stylo 3, it’s the LG Stylo 3 Plus due to all the technology that T-Mobile-MetroPCS has going on for all of it’s customers there. The LG Stylo 3 is just a regular piece of crap that is mainly used with carriers like Sprint, Boost Mobile, AT&T and Cricket Wireless. I meant from the upgraded phone after the Stylo. I would need to get the V20 for it to really be an upgrade(except for the size) … now @ $480 + the G pad. So you upgraded to the LG V20 is what you are telling me, correct?? You did it again you meant to say upgraded from the LG G Stylo to the LG V20 verses having to upgrade to anymore LG Stylos series.. Is it for real that it has a 1080p display.? Cause the other models … boost and virgin have 720p.. Full 1080p video/full screen quality on the phone there Bud.. What about dual band Wifi? I know the other models couldn’t connect to 5g Wifi.. Huh? Never heard of the whole 5G wifi stuff as of yet. 5G network is not even active as yet.. Oh you mean LTE Unlicensed Spectrum you mean?? LTE U.. No I mean if you have a dual band router that has both 2.4ghz and 5.0 gud. I think when I tested the Stylo 3 from Boost it didn’t have a 5 ghz option.. LG Stylo 3 Plus is only for you to try out with T-Mobile-MetroPCS. LG Stylo 3 with Boost is way different from the LG Stylo 3 Plus with T-Mobile-MetroPCS.. Save your breath he doesn’t even know dual band wifi exists. All Stylos can, from the very first one, you just have to click / enable in the settings.. What he is referring to is T-Mobile-MetroPCS LTE Unlicensed 5Ghz Spectrum.. I think I misspoke… There’s option to Tether either way. LG Stylo 3+ uses the Snapdragon 435, which is an SoC processor/modem,. and has support for both 2.4 and 5 Ghz Wi-Fi bands. Snapdragon 427, which also has support for both bands. Boost Mobile LG Stylo 3 wouldn’t have support... Annnnddd….every new high end phone has a 4K OLED display with a snapdragon 835. So in your world a Ford Escort is on par with a Porsche 911. Your story is invalid and non factual. I dont need your own true fact or opinion. You’re once again trying to prove a point, Because????? Why did you say such ridiculous statement as every new high end phone coming with 4k hd screening for? That was not on our topic to be talked about. We were specifically talking about Full HD 1080p video viewing verses 4k. [Laughing] 2gb of ram add bloatware gtfooh. Too be fair this isnt even mid range so I think it’s pretty good for the price definitely better stuff out there though. Huh Not even midrange? Please do not say Low Range device. This is either considered as an high end device or midrange device. Come on now Brother you cannot be serious right now. It has higher specs than a low end device would have been. This phone is usually worth over 100 to 200 something dollars with T-Mobile-MetroPCS.. 200 dollars or less is high end now. Gimme whatever your high on brother. 200 dollars or less than 200 dollars is still considered a midrange to high end phone dude. Low end devices usually range from under 50 Dollars to 19 dollars now. Check your facts there my friend. It still can be considered a High End or Midrange device. I did say either High end or midrange. At least back me up to saying, “You’re right, this right here is an actual midrange verses low end”. No need to give out false statements about it not being low end.. Just a difference in opinion I see high end generally being 650 plus mid range being 350 or so and lower end being generally sub 200 and you see it differently. the only thing close to being a good value around 200 imo is the huawei honor 6x it’s about 230 unlocked. You are not telling the truth. This phone is worth 100 to 200 something dollars, meaning yes this is worth of a phone to get, due to all the specs and internal storage, 1080 video, battery and faster charging it really has. So again this is still considered a midrange phone as a true fact. Have a nice Day now Buddy.. Actually, the Stylo 3 and 3+ are still classed as Low to Mid range phones, and that’s only because the hardware is slightly better then most low end phones in it’s price point.. Not to say it’s not worth what it costs, but it is definitely not a mid to high end phone just because it has a few minor improvements over it’s predecessors. Mid to High would be like an Honor 8, One Plus 3T, LG G6 or something along those lines.. I’m going to say it again The LG Stylo 3 Plus is still classified as a midrange phone verses a low ranged phone. What a pathetic idea of you to think that this phone is low range? How many cups of liquor did you have this morning there Buddy or perhaps last night? The LG Stylo 3 should not have been in the same sentence as LG Stylo 3 Plus. The LG Stylo 3 has lesser features and specs verses the LG Stylo 3 Plus(that is a phone only usuable with T-Mobile-MetroPCS Advanced LTE/Featurings within the network itself). Plus the LG Stylo 3 is known to be used with Sprint/Boost Mobile old broke down behind network. Lol Lol Why are you calling this phone lowrange verses leaving it be said as Midrange?? Lame statment and thought. Let me guess, a Samsung Galaxy S8 would make your head explode, right?. Right? And why are you asking me this ridiculous question for Sir? No reason. Anything with a snapdragon 435 is a LOW END phone at best. Not even close to mid range and far far away from any high end flagship phone. Nothing false at all calling this low end.. This is a midrange to high range phone. This phone over here is not an low end phone regardless the processor. I believe that 200 to 300 something processors are considered high end to midrange, due to the phone costing 100 to 200 something dollars. Fact is this a Midrange and not an low end phone. Finally!! No more annoying buttons in the back!!! It’s about time LG did away with the back buttons!!!. They still have the power button on the back along with the speaker back there.. I can deal with the power button on the back. It is having to deal with the volume buttons on the back that I hate. The volumes on the back were very annoying to me to deal with.. Use the pulldown menu to access volume​ on-screen.. Also, if you didn’t know, a double tap on the screen wakes up the phone.. The rear power button that doubles as a fingerprint scanner is what I miss the most about the V20 now that I have an S8. sold my iphone 7 and wanted to downgrade to something cheaper. for normal day to day stuff it has no issues. dont intend to game on it at all. ill miss the speakers and camera on the iphone 7 for sure but its all good.. Zmax Pro a bigger screen, solid device, works great and way cheaper. In my opinion, since the Stylo 2 Plus had similar specs this one should’ve been bumped up a bit more.. Again your opinion was falsely written talking this device needed to be bumped up a little bit more. Please, it was bumped up a little bit more.. Surprised no one mentioned this, The LG Stylo 3 Plus will also have the gyroscope sensor. Neither the LG Stylo 2 Plus, nor the Zmax Pro has the gyroscope.. Good to know I can save over $20 a month on my JOD if I wanted to downgrade from the S8 at some point.. I did that with the Note7, going to the Stylo PLus 2 – real nice phone. Huh?? You meant Lg Stylo 2 Plus or perhaps LG Stylo 3 Plus. You see the difference? I was a bit confused by your statement for a second there my friend. There’s no such thing as LG Stylo Plus 2 or I guess you meant as a meaning by the 2nd version to LG Stylo Pluses. You have a lot of free time... Thank you I sure do sweetie. No mention of fast charging – which it is capable of…. But you do realize that you were still a little wrong for saying that the LG Stylo 3 Plus had about the same specs as the LG Stylo 2 PLUS did. Plus again the LG Stylo 3 PLUS was able to have 1080p screening, plus an upgrade from thr 2900 mah battery to an 3081 mah battery, faster charging, expanded 32gb of internal storage. Lastly it comes with 66 aws spectrum frequency capabilities within T-Mobile-MetroPCS Nation network.. I said similar, not the same. I agree, it’s a good choice for budged conscious or a back-up phone. But in my opinion, LG could’ve done better. The great thing is choice which we have now, and a $9 a month EIP payment.. Yes you said that, but you talked about specs could have been bumped up a little better. Your statement should not include similar. Instead what I see is nonsense at least a little bit. You could have said, “This LG Stylo 3 Plus has improved as far as specs and upgraded features, expanded internal storage, better battery that is now 3108 mah Battery, faster battery charge and the screen now including full HD 1080p video over LG Stylo 2 Plus(that has lesser internal storage, lesser HD view of video) is concerned, but I feel that I would much rather wait for something else better. Why say it could have been bumped up a little bit Better in your other paragraph for there Buddy? You made no sense to me at all whatsoever there Bud. Learn to state true facts verses having to tear down something that is at least a little bit better than a pervious item that you expect to have had lesser this or that sort of thing. I think and believe it to be a big upgrade from the LG Stylo 2 Plus and it having a better power button with finget print sensor with the power button now positioned right sides of the phone. I said “In My Opinion” they could’ve done better. Did you not read “My Opinion” portion?. You have yours and I mine. If you disagree with my opinion then I’m sorry to hurt your feelings.. Nope you sure did not say in your opinion. You tried stating it as a fact that it had about the same specs and not much improvements, knowing all of that to not have been truely stated. Like I says before state facts verses fictions. Thoroughly examine things before making your assumptions or talking about not improving, knowing LG in this situation did improve in their full HD 1080 video and screening, internal storage, the volume buttons no longer being listed on the back of the phone and of course 66 spectrum signal to use in other areas now. So again why talk a little nonsense on this particular device here? You are obviously not truthful with stating facts. Stop talking in circles with the stating opinions part, knowing you told a lie about it not improving much. My suggestion is to go with what I was telling you to say in the first place. Have yourself a nice Day now.. He stated “In my opinion” in two different comments.. “My suggestion is to go with what I was telling you to say in the first place.” LMFAO!. I’m not following you at all. and I work here in Anaheim on East and 91. I still work in Costa Mesa.. =P I’ll wave hi on my up and down the mountain.. I thought I had it bad.. Ah poor Dear you miss your friend? You might as well follow her since you are so desperate.. So what if he stated it as an opinion. He stated false facts without real truth is what I’m saying. Have a nice Day now darling.. Nice that it seems to have a removable battery. Still too giant-sized of a phone for me, but at least it’s cheap and now has 1080p.. I hope metropcs gets it too I had one briefly with boost and I liked it but boost wasn’t good in my area. Did you not read the title and post? MetroPCS will, too get the LG Stylo 3 Plus soon.. I was able to see it now looking forward to it I may skip iPhone lol. Thank You metropcs for also getting it. I read first week of June for metropcs I used briefly with boost mobile only bad thing was reception in my area and job other wisebit was good for me like a comment on here I dont game maybe YouTube here and there but I do have spotify for my music at work in back room so when it gets released I want it back my wife’s cousin has LG stylus2 but 3 will be better and gonna rub in her face lol. Boost Mobile just has the regular LG Stylo 3 verses the more advanced LG Stylo 3 Plus that is only known to be sold and used with T-Mobile-MetroPCS. Boost Mobile has lesser internal storage memory than what T-Mobile-MetroPCS has. Plus Sprint/Boost Mobile does not have actual Advanced Messaging, Video Calling, Enhanced Voice Services, Advanced Wifi Calling, HD Voice, Voice over LTE services on their own network. Looks like I’m goin to a metropcs store on payday :). Oh cool that right there is awesome. So glad to hear that part there friend. Dish what sweets? I have nothing to take okay? What are you saying? Like I says before your homeboy gave out false facts. No opinion about it being the same as him talking about the LG Stylo 3 Plus is about the same as the LG Stylo 2 Plus and him talking the LG Stylo 3 PLUS didn’t receive much bump in upgrades and updates, and him saying some specs could have been bumped up a little bit more. Tell your boyfriend to tell the truth about what he failed to state as fact verses fairy tales. Anything else? More time wasted on your part there. You continue to try and call others out by claiming they’re posting false fact but don’t seem to follow the same set of “rules” yourself. Your attacks are weak and false. I drank a liter of water. Sorry, but my statements are factual while others like yours are false and you not being able to read is total out of whack styles. Again you obviously have trouble reading. Your lousy friend is the one that is telling a lie about how this phone here did not improve. He did lie about the phone not improving, knowing him to have failed to tell the truth about how this phone increased to being 32 internal storage memory, HD 1080p video view with carrier 66 spectrum. “Sorry, but my statements are factual while others like yours are false”. Which statement did I make that was false?. You failed to tell the truth about him being wrong with him saying his lousy behind comment about this particular phone here having about the same specs as the other phone did. Get out of here with your lies and non factual statements. Like I said again learn to freaking read thoroughly. Obviously you are dumb and pathetic as heck.. I’ll be back when you have actually answered my question.. Do you have trouble reading or something? Because I keep on repeating that your dumb friend fails to tell the truth. Again you are just as pathetic as your dumb behind friend is.. It’s rather unhealthy how unraveled you become when someone comments to you. You’ve done this time and time again. Take a deep breath, it’ll be ok.. I got this phone on Sunday to use on a second line. Phone is capable, screen is good, everything flows as it should. It has all the latest T-Mobile features built in, but so will every new phone T-Mobile sells shortly. Is it a high end flagship phone like some say on here?. Answer is no, it’s a capable $200 phone that works pretty well and that’s it. If you want something for $9 a month or $225 cash price then you won’t be disappointed,. you want something great you’ll need to spend quite a bit more.. Just get a moto g4… Much better phone!!. It also has NFC for Android Pay! Hard to find that on budget phones.. And it doesn’t even have Android 7.1, so it’s basically outdated at release.
