CNET también está disponible en español.. LG releases fashion-forward, wallet-friendly pair of phones. The LG K8 and K5 will be available in emerging markets later this year.. by March 15, 2016 11:04 AM PDT. LG K8 specifications: 5.0-inch HD display 1.3GHz quad-core CPU Rear 8-megapixel camera Front 5-megapixel camera 1.5GB RAM with microSD expansion slot (1GB in Latin America) Removable 2,125mAh battery Android 5.0 Marshmallow Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n Bluetooth 4.2 NFC USB 2.0 Color options: gold, indigo and white Available in: Asia, Africa, Middle East, CIS and Latin America LG K5 specifications: 5.0-inch VGA display 1.3GHz quad-core Rear 5-megapixel camera Front 2-megapixel camera 8GB internal storage 1GB RAM with microSD card expansion slot Removable 1,900mAh battery Android 6.1 Lollipop Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n Bluetooth 4.1 USB 2.0 Colors options: gold, silver and titan Available in: Europe, CIS, Latin America and Mexico. Flagship phones, like the LG G5 and Samsung Galaxy S7 , have a high-end allure to them with lofty prices to match. If spending an arm and a leg for a new phone isn't an option, LG is offering two alternatives, the K5 and K8 , that might be a better fit for your budget -- without sacrificing a sense of style.. The pair are expected to hit emerging markets later this year and pricing has yet to be announced, but LG purports that they'll be reasonably priced. This post will be updated when that information is available.. The LG K8 is the fancier of the two, sporting an au courant look with curved edges and a woven-textured back panel. It has a sharper screen and better cameras than the K5, but is otherwise very similar to it. Both models come in a variety of colors, including gold, and the K5 comes in "titan", which I'm pretty sure is just a lavish way of saying "black.". They don't hold a candle to the fancy modular LG G5 , but these phones are stripped down in features in order to meet a lower price point. Since they're geared toward emerging markets, like the K7 and K10 , it's unlikely that we'll see them hit US stores.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

There is also 8GB of storage and microSD card slot on-board. On the back is 8MP autofocus camera with LED flash. The phone is powered by 2,125mAh Li-Ion battery and runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow..

Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Quad-core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit.

Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

User ratings and reviews for LG K8. 4 Out of 5. 5 Star 4 Star 1 3 Star 2 Star 1 Star. Displaying review(s) 1- 1 of 1 Sort by: Most Helpful Most Recent. By Don Carner | 23 Jun 2016. For 2 years, I've carried a MotoG. When circumstances warranted shopping for a replacement, I was shown the LG K8 as an option.. Not succumbing to contract plans, I've opted to pay as I go monthly. Good, bad or indifferent, this plan has suited both income and convenience.. Having looked at iPhones, Samsungs, Motorolas, et al, the LG appeared to be a quality phone at first blush.. At 62, I buy smartphones not cameras. No selfies or Snapchat, etc., the balance of performance vs. investment sold me on the K8 running Marshmallow, 6.0.. 4g network on my carrier of choice, this model is a stellar, mid-pricepoint behemoth. I installed a 32gB micro SD as the modest 8 gig onboard memory is dominated by rooted apps.. Why not a "5-STAR" rating? Choosing a default method to save all media files over to SD storage is a convoluted mess. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 3 out of 3 people found this review helpful.

The camera completely stinks as it does not take good pictures wether it be dark or daylight and the hotspot doesn't work right 99.9% of the time. I can turn it on and it will shut off itself. I can turn it on for someone else to use but if i am using my phone it will turn off. I get tired of constantly having to turn it back on when i shouldn't and NO i dont have a timer set on it to turn off. I have that option off at all times. So if you are thinking about buying this phone your best bet would be to spend a lil more money and get a better phone or you will be very disappointed if you buy this phone! It's just plain well you know not worth it and not worth your TIME or MONEY!. Rated 5 out of. Until about a year ago I only used a 'flip' phone. A friend gave me a used I 5 phone. I used it for a couple of months and gave it back, but I was hooked. It was very easy to navigate and learn how to use the features that I was interested in. My friend who had an I 6, has now purchased an LG K8, and is very pleased with it.. Rated 4 out of. I honestly thought i would hate it. After forgetting my galaxy s7 on the roof of the car w\o insurance i purchased the lg k8. I knew i'd hate it but needed something CHEAP. It has great function, the slim design and arched feel is great. The only thing i dont like is the storage being 8gb but for the price i can deal with it. It is my first LG, but not my last.

CNET también está disponible en español.. LG K8 and K10 pack nifty camera tricks into a midrange lineup. Days before MWC, LG unveils two new midtier Android Nougat phones.. February 22, 2018 1:11 PM PST. LG is kicking things off a little early. A few days before the start of. MWC 2018 , otherwise known as the world's biggest mobile industry trade show, the company announced it will unveil two new phones at the conference.. Known as the K8 and K10, these phones will be available in Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. They come in three colors (black, blue and gold) and will add to LG's lineup of affordable, midrange phones.. No pricing or availability date is yet known for the devices. But we do know that both phones run Android 7.1.2 Nougat and tout a handful of camera features, including improved noise-reduction for low-light pictures, a flashing timer for group photos and "Flash Jump Shot." This feature stitches up to 20 photos together and creates a shareable GIF.. LG V30 is the 'everything but the kitchen sink' phone. The K10, which is the more advanced of the two phones, has a 5.3-inch display, an octacore processor and a 3,000mAh battery. The K10 will also come in three variants depending on the market. These have different amounts of memory (from 2 to 3GB), storage (16 to 32GB) and camera specs (either a 13- or 8-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a front-facing 8- or 5-megapixel camera).. Meanwhile, there is only one model of the 5-inch K8. It's equipped with a quadcore processor and an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera. It also has a front-facing 5-megapixel camera and a 2,500mAh removable battery.. This won't be the only phone LG will announce at the show. While the company confirmed it won't launch its next flagship at MWC, it will release a new variant of last year's LG V30 , which will add image recognition software to the camera called Vision AI as well as Voice AI commands.. We'll know more about all three phones once we get our hands on them, so check back for more info. In the meantime, read CNET's full coverage of. MWC 2018 , which kicks off on Sunday, Feb.

LG K8 LG K8 review: A middling Moto G rival. facebook twitter google+ email Comments. inc VAT (SIM-free, as of 13th May). Page 1 of 2 LG K8 review: A middling Moto G rival 1. LG K8 review: A middling Moto G rival 2. Display, Storage, Camera, Conclusion & Specifications. It's fast and has a great design, but the LG K8's camera and underwhelming display drag it down. Processor : Quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek MT6735, Screen Size : 5in, Screen resolution : 1,280x720, Rear camera : 8 megapixels, Storage (free) : 16GB, Wireless data : 3G, 4G, Size : 145x72x8.7mm, Weight : 157g, Operating system : Android 6.0.1. The LG K8 initially reviewed at £130 can now be found for just shy of £105 , where it takes aim at the. 3rd Gen Moto G , which can be found for around £150 , marking a small price difference over its. The G4 is an incredible bargain and most people should buy one without a second thought. However, its 5.5in screen size might put off a few people who struggle using a 5.5in phone with one hand.. Step forward the smaller, easier to handle, LG K8 and 3rd Gen Mogo G rival smartphones. Both are budget smartphones and offer similar specifications. The LG K8 is now a lot cheaper, making it an even more attractive purchase- do bear in mind that when reviewed both the LG K8 and 3rd Gen Moto G could be found for around £130. We've since updated this review to reflect the price changes.. With a quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek MT6735 processor and 1.5GB of RAM, it managed almost identical results to the 3rd Gen Moto G in our Geekbench 3 benchmarks. Whereas the Moto G scored 531 and 1,625 respectively in Geekbench 3's single and multicore tests, the LG K8 finished with results of 536 and 1,602. Indeed, it certainly felt pretty nippy and responsive during day-to-day use, and LG's version of Android 6.0.1 never felt like it was struggling to keep up with our swipes and taps.. LG K8 UK SIM-Free Smartphone - Blue. Even the K8's GPU performance was good, as graphics tends to be an area where MediaTek chips have struggled in the past compared to their Qualcomm-based counterparts. In GFX Bench GL's offscreen Manhattan 3.0 test, for example, the LG K8 scores a very reasonable 188 frames (around 3.0fps), putting it ahead of the 3rd Gen Moto G which only produced 103 frames (or 1.7fps).. I wasn't able to see how it handled Hearthstone, as the game kept crashing on launch, but other 3D games like Beach Buggy Racing worked absolutely fine, providing a smooth frame rate that rarely stuttered or made it a hassle to play. Simpler games like Threes! also felt silky smooth on the LG K8, so it should be more than capable of keeping you entertained when you need a bit of a distraction.. Web browsing was a little more stop-and-start while pages were loading, which is no doubt a result of its rather underwhelming score of 497 in the Peacekeeper web browsing test. However, as long as you're prepared to wait a few seconds, even media-heavy pages like the Guardian homepage can become perfectly manageable when scrolling up and down at speed.. I'm a big fan of the LG K8's design as well, as its plastic, cross-hatch patterned back feels great in the hand and provides an excellent level of grip. You can prise it off to reveal the phone's battery and microSD slot, but overall it feels well built for a budget handset and it's very comfy to hold and use one-handed. It will take some time to get used to LG's rear-facing buttons, but the power button is positioned at just the right height for your forefinger, and its ridged surface makes it easy to pick out in between the two volume keys.. The K8's battery life is also promising, as its 2,125mAh battery lasted 10h 16m in our continuous video playback test. It's still an hour behind the 3rd Gen Moto G, but it's still pretty respectable for a budget smartphone.. Page 1 of 2 LG K8 review: A middling Moto G rival 1. LG K8 review: A middling Moto G rival 2.

LG K8 Review: This £99 5-inch mobile offers decent value for money and works particularly well as a second handset for trips. Here’s our full LG K8 review.. You might know LG for its top-end flagship smartphones like the LG G5 , but the Korean manufacturer has been pumping out plenty of cheaper handsets in 2016 too. The LG K8 (or ‘LG Kate as we affectionately call it) comes snapping at the heels of the super-budget LG K4 , the funky but flawed dual-display LG X Screen and the utterly pointless. LG Stylus 2 , and this is easily our favourite phone of the bunch.. For a £99 mobile, the K8 is actually quite easy on the eye. curved edging is an attractive touch of detail, while the phone’s frame is also pleasingly skinny. The only design element we’re put off by is the cheap plastic rear, which looks and feels very budget indeed.. Still, it’s good to see LG’s rear-mounted power and volume buttons make a welcome return. These sit centrally, just beneath the camera lens, and their bumpy, textured surfaces are easy to find with your fingertips. LG noobs may need a period of adjustment, but we’re big fans.. You can also prise off that back panel, which gives you easy access to the removable battery plus the nano SIM and microSD card slots.. One handed use isn’t particularly easy, as the K8 sports some pretty chunky bezels on each edge. Still, it’s only reaching for the notification bar from the top of the screen that proves particularly frustrating and you can get around that by adding the handy notifications shortcut to the lower toolbar.. If you want a phone you can knock around, the K8 also feels reassuringly rugged. Check out our LG K8 unboxing video if you want an up-close look at the K8’s design.. These days there’s no excuse for a ropey phone display, especially as one of its main rivals, the Vodafone Smart Prime 7 , boasts an eye-pleasing screen for just 75 quid.. Luckily the K8 doesn’t disappoint, offering up its own 5-inch 720p panel that’s more or less a match for Voda’s screen. Lean in close and you can see individual pixels, but at normal operating distance it’s sharp enough for enjoying photos and video. Colours aren’t muted or dull, while viewing angles are also pleasingly wide.. Audio is pumped out of a tiny speaker on the back of the K8, which is quite vulnerable to accidental smothering when you’re using the phone. Sound quality is rather pants and you’ll struggle to hear anything over standard background noise in public.. Don’t like streaming your music and other entertainment? Don’t worry, the meagre 8GB of storage can be expanded by slipping a microSD memory card inside the phone. And if you’re really in a pinch, there’s even a built-in FM radio so you can listen to a relaxing bit of Radio 2.. While the LG K4 stuck with the older Android 5.1, the K8 upgrades to full Android 6.0 Marshmallow. This gives you bonus features like full control over app permissions, as well as old favourites like Google’s Smart Lock support.. LG has also added in some of its own features in the form of LG UX. Security has been beefed up with the addition of Knock Code, although we personally found that this was unresponsive and eventually gave up. Far better is the Capture+ notes tool, which can be used to scrawl messages during phone calls. And we like the revamped notifications bar, which adds customisable shortcuts.. The LG K8 runs off a basic Mediatek processor, backed by 1.5GB of RAM. And while this obviously offers limited performance, we were happy enough with the phone’s smooth everyday experience.. Android runs well, with only the occasional pause when loading an app to remind you that this is a budget blower. And you can even play fast-paced games like Real Racing without game-ruining stutters.. Battery life sadly isn’t too hot. The K8 will just about see you through the day with occasional message checks and the rest. But if you start to browse the web or smash out a document, you’ll lose roughly 20 percent of life per hour. That means the K8 is definitely best suited to casual users or as a secondary handset.. That dinky 2125mAh battery doesn’t cope too well with media streaming either. Just over four hours of YouTube fun was what we enjoyed on a full charge, which is well behind most other mobiles.. You probably shouldn’t expect a quality snapper at this price point, but the K8’s 8-megapixel camera is fine for shooting the odd social pic.. To start, LG’s camera app is decent, with a simple point-and-tap mode for anyone who wants a straightforward experience. The auto-focus isn’t exactly fast but it does the job, and you can manually tap to focus too.Manual controls are limited however, so the K8 really is geared towards the average consumer.. Our pics on the whole came out well, with outdoor shots packing enough detail to look good on a big screen. The only problem is the K8’s low light performance, which results in blurry, grainy shots almost every time. The front-facing selfie camera is also very basic, offering very poor shots when the lights go down.. Video quality is also a bit pants. Our HD test footage was rather grainy, with manual focus fully required to keep your subject as sharp as possible. And of course there’s no image stabilisation, so any little movements are replicated in full on the finished video.. The LG K8 is a solid all-round affordable mobile that gives the excellent Vodafone Smart Prime 7 a run for its money. If you’re after a no-frills everyday handset or a dependable second mobile for taking to festivals and the rest, we’d happily recommend it.. Of course, Vodafone customers will likely prefer the Smart Prime 7, which at just £75 offers even better value for your cash. If you’re on a different network, the K8 is a good alternative..

LG will bring new photography-focused K8 and K10 to MWC. LG will announce new additions to its K8 and K10 budget range at MWC 2018. The new additions will seemingly focus on bringing flagship-level photography to the budget market.. The K10 comes in three different editions, all with a 5.3-inch screen running a 1,280 x 720 resolution. Buyers will be able to choose between the standard K10, the K10+, and the K10α (“Alpha”). The K10 and K10α will sport similar internal specs, rocking 2GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage, while the pumped up K10+ contains 3GB of RAM and 32GB of initial storage. As in the K8, all three versions of the K10 will have a MicroSD card slot, and be capable of expanding available storage by up to a mighty 2TB. It’s all powered by a hefty 3,000mAh battery.. The K10 and K10+ will both be equipped with the same 13-megapixel camera technology we saw on the LG G6 , an impressive addition to a budget phone. However, the K10 only has a single lens, and it won’t be wide-angle. Around the front of the K10 and K10+ you’ll find two lenses — an 8MP lens and a wide-angle 5MP lens. Together, those support the “bokeh” portrait mode we saw on many 2017 flagships and a wide-angle selfie mode, allowing users to get larger groups in shot or show more of the background. This camera suite is backed up by LG’s PDAF auto-focus, which LG claims is 23-percent faster than normal auto-focus.. The K10α seems to be a lower priced version, likely intended for developing markets, and sees a small downgrade in camera tech, having an 8MP lens on the rear and a single 5MP normal lens on the front. It seems to still support the PDAF seen on the other versions.. The rear of the metallic-style K10 will house the fingerprint sensor, which also works as a Quick Shutter for the camera.. The smaller LG K8 comes in a single edition, and will sport a 5-inch display running the same 1,280 x 720 resolution as the larger K10. The device comes with 2GB of RAM, 16GB of onboard storage, and the option for up to 2TB of expandable storage with a MicroSD card. The 2,500mAh battery seems small by today’s standards, but should be more than sufficient to keep the modest specifications running for a good battery life — and it’s also removable and replaceable.. You’ll find a similar camera suite to the K10α on the K8 — an 8MP lens on the rear and a 5MP on the front. The tech has been tweaked from the last K8, improving low-light performance and keeping fan-favorite features Auto Shot, Gesture Shot, Flash for Selfie, and Quick Share.. Both phones will come in a variety of colors, including Aurora Black, Moroccan Blue, and Terra Gold. You can find more of what to expect at MWC 2018 in our handy guide ..

Hola compre mi kg k8 de 2da mano y hasta ahora todo le funcionaba bien. Hace unos días la pantalla tactil empezó a vooverce media loca y a funcionar sin yo tocar nada, esto se quita un rato cuando apago y enciendo la pantalla, ya lo puse de fabrica y le quite la mica de cristal pensando que se estaba metiendo la humedad. me deja de responder el tactil y veces funciona solo. que le pasa a mi teléfono ??. Tengo el problema en el LG k8 2017 que por ratos el celular se pone super lento, y no puedo crear otra pantalla para iconos... que problema es y como se puede solucionar?. compre un lg k8v en estados unidos y no lo pueden liberar aca en ecuador que debo hacer con el celular. Presenta serios problemas de calentamiento en 3G y 4G.. las llamadas + el Wase lo traban y hay que esperar a que enfríe.. No compren este celular, es muy malo... Pixela y distorsiona los videos de todas las redes... Y en LG me dicen q no tiene problemas el equipo... compre el celular LG K8 el 26 de octubre del 2017, ya me cambiaron dos veces porque en redes socilaes los videoas los pixelada en color verde y rosa. sigue haciendo lo mismo, y me dijeron que es un problema de las redes sociales. la verdad una verguenza esta marca y este celular. no compren LG, todos hacen lo mismo, ya se varias personas que les pasa lo mismo. y la empresa no quiere hacerce cargo. lo quize cambiar por otra marca pero la gente de claro dice que los tecnicos de LG no lo autorizan porque dicen que no es una falla del equipo... habria que mandarles una carta documento o quejarse a defensa al consumidor, lo cual estoy por hacer.....ojala lean este mensaje y me manden una solucion.. Bueno yo lo compré soy d Nicaragua ya tengo 5 meses d tenerlo y hasta la fecha no me ha dado ningun problema Y espero q no me los de. Ojalá los problemas d los demás usuarios sean arreglados pronto.. COMO PUEDO RECUPERAR UNA LLAMADA GRABADA. Compré en Panamá un teléfono móvil LG K8 2017 funciono 2 dias bien, regrese a mi país y cuando le coloque la tarjeta SIM e intento hacer una llamada aparece un aviso en la pantalla "Se ha detenido la aplicación Teléfono" y lo mismo sucede cuando intento leer o enviar SMS, aparece el aviso en la pantalla "Se ha detenido la aplicación Mensajería". Llame al servicio técnico LG latinoamérica, te atienden mal y no te dan información sobre la falla, se limitan a decir hay que llevarlo por garantia donde lo compro. Soy de Venezuela y aquí esa porqueria de empresa No presta el servicio de garantía. No compren ese telefono, es malo. además LG es una pseudo empresa con un pésimo servicio post-venta y en mi caso son 160 dólares perdidos.

Dos propuestas de mediana a baja gama de ZTE: Blade V9 y Blade V9 VITA, dos modelos con ligeras diferencias. Podría ocurrir que se repitan en otro lado, pero las cámaras del Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+ son algo único.

more ... more .... more ... more .... OS Android (6.0), LG UX UI. Dimensions 5.69 x 2.81 x 0.34 inches (144.6 x 71.5 x 8.7 mm). Weight 4.94 oz (140 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution 720 x 1280 pixels. Features Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Camcorder 1280x720 (720p HD) (30 fps). Quad-core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features Album art cover, Background playback. GSM 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. LTE (FDD) Bands 3, 7, 8, 20.

The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. FCC ID value: ZNFK350N link. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $125 Buy.
