The Good Dual rear cameras delivers true 2x optical zoom, with a cool bokeh Portrait mode. Battery lasts longer than last year's model, and longer than iPhone 7. Bigger storage options include 256GB model for serious photographers.. The Bad There's no standard headphone jack: you'll have to use Lightning, or the included adapter, or go wireless. Design is showing its age, as competing phones squeeze a 5.5-inch screen into smaller, sexier bodies. The Bottom Line The iPhone 7 Plus is one of the best point-and-shoot cameras ever -- and it's a great phone, too.. Both have the same fast A10 Fusion processor. Both have optical image stabilization on the rear camera for better low-light photos. Both lack headphone jacks. Two rear cameras -- one wide angle, one telephoto -- that can zoom in at 2x or even further digitally. And it can create depth-of-field blur effects, or "bokeh" type effects, with portrait photos in a unique camera mode. Better battery life, but not by a huge amount. 3GB of RAM, instead of 2GB It's heavier and bigger. And, of course, it costs more. How the dual cameras up the ante. Editors' note (March 21, 2017): Apple has unveiled new editions of its flagship iPhone 7 and 7 Plus as part of the (Red) program, which funds programs that combat HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. The special edition models will come in 128-gigabyte and 256GB configurations, starting at $749 (£699). The company has also doubled the storage capacity of its budget iPhone SE , which starts at $399 and is now available with 32GB or 128GB of storage. The company is expected to unveil the next-generation iPhone 8 in September 2017.. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus get a new vibrant color.. The original iPhone 7 Plus review, published in September 2016 and updated since then, follows.. Phone cameras are getting really damn good.. Samsung's Galaxy S7 , the Google Pixel , and the iPhone 7 all take photos that sometimes border on astonishing. In that sense, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus aren't as distinctive as phones anymore. They're excellently made, superfast, and this time they're water-resistant, too. They're great phones, but we already knew that about the iPhone .. Apple iPhone 7 Plus makes a good thing even better. When Apple first made the larger Plus phones back in 2014, the appeal was always about screen size, battery life, and to a small extent, the camera. Really, all the larger 5.5-inch model had that the standard 4.7-incher didn't was optical image stabilization (OIS). This year, the iPhone 7 finally gets OIS -- great for smoothing out shaky-handed pics and videos.. That's just one of the many similarities between the 7 and 7 Plus. Really, they're two variants on the same phone:. Camera shootout: iPhone 7 Plus vs. iPhone 7 Plus 'portrait' mode does background blur better. The iPhone 7 Plus has a few distinct advantages:. iOS 10: All the new features, tips and guides. 23 hidden features in iOS 10. 15 ways iOS 10 will make the iPhone better. After several months trying both phones, I prefer the 7 Plus. But I spend my life on my phone and run around shooting photos and videos for work-related posts. For me, it's an essential tool, and I justify the extra camera quality.. For a lot of others, the Plus will seem unnecessary. Pick the phone that you can afford, and go with battery packs for charge-ups. But I still feel like I miss that headphone jack, even though I honestly don't find many instances anymore where I need it.. Put another way: Everything we like -- and dislike -- about the smaller iPhone 7 applies to the 7 Plus model, too. ( Read the iPhone 7 review here .) Just know that you're paying a premium of $120, £120 or AU$190 when you step up to the 7 Plus at each storage capacity. (Yes, the price has crept up a bit from last year.). But if you like shooting photos with your phone, it's totally worth it.. Editors' note: This review was originally posted in September 2016. It has since been updated with performance charts, battery life, and tests done with iOS 10.1, as well as comparisons to the Google Pixel camera.. The iPhone 7 Plus is Apple's most advanced phone to date.. Samsung and other manufacturers are doing a far better job folding identical 5.5-inch or larger displays into bodies that feel smaller and better in your hand, like the S7 Edge 's. But now with cameras that can truly differentiate it from its smaller sibling, the 7 Plus finally has an easy justification for that jumbo size. It's finally the step-up experience the larger phone needed.. But keep in mind that next year's iPhone may solve the size problem, and fold more screen into a smaller body. You might want to consider holding out and seeing what happens in 2017 with that new design.. I'm not a pro photographer, but I'm trying to get better. James Martin, a senior photographer at CNET, is. He shot with the 7 Plus in the Bay Area, while I took it around and used it for everyday life in New York and New Jersey.. Compare and contrast James' photos from the 7 Plus to 6S Plus to the Samsung Galaxy S7 here.. The dual cameras don't actually zoom, like a point-and-shoot camera with a protruding lens. Instead, the phone switches between the wide-angle camera and the telephoto, from 1 to 2x. From there, the camera app can digitally zoom up to 10x versus 5x on the iPhone 7. The camera made these nosebleed seats look good.. What products work with Apple HomeKit?. The complete list of Siri commands (so far). Digital zoom works better than it used to, but zooming in too far still results in blurry, digitized pics. But adding the 2x optical helps frame photos: I found many landscape shots transformed.. I went to the New York Jets' season opener and sat in the cheap seats. And being able to zoom in closer to the game action with less loss of detail was a great change -- all without a big, heavy camera around my neck.. Note, too, that the camera equals the low-light performance of its smaller sibling, which is an improvement over the 6S/6S Plus models. But also note that the Google Pixel's low light capabilities are even better. To compare Pixel vs iPhone 7 Plus, check out this in-depth comparison ..

Faster on all performance measures, with better battery life, than last year's iPhones. iOS still leads on high-quality games and creative apps.. Lacks a 3.5mm jack, and there aren't a lot of Lightning-compatible headphones yet. Not all models are compatible with all carriers.. Absence of headphone jack aside, the 7 Plus is the best iPhone you can buy, with more memory than its smaller counterpart and dual cameras that peer toward Apple's future.. For the first time, we're recommending the big phone —in this case, the iPhone 7 Plus — as the iPhone to get this year. Apple's two new phones , the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, offer mostly stepwise improvements over last year's models. Older iPhone owners will likely most appreciate the significant improvement in battery life. There's a cost (other than the $769 and up you'll pay for the iPhone 7 Plus), as you're going to struggle for a few months with being an early adopter of the headphone jack-free lifestyle. But the iPhone 7 Plus offers enough benefits and improvements to make it worth your while. What's New This Year? The iPhone 7 Plus is exactly the size of last year's iPhone 6s Plus , at 6.23 by 3.07 by 0.29 inches (HWD) , but a little bit lighter, at 6.63 ounces compared with 6.77. It may not fit into the same cases , however, because the dual rear cameras require a larger cutout. The phone is still kind of a surfboard, and doesn't fit into my pocket or the phone strap on my backpack. But that's the case with most phablets, other than the sadly doomed Galaxy Note 7 (0.3 inches wide).. The main visual changes are a larger camera bump on the back for the dual 12MP rear cameras, and the lack of a headphone jack on the bottom, replaced by a grille for the barometer vent. The Taptic home button looks the same as last year's, but it's a virtual rather than a physical button. According to various sources, Apple made the switch in part because of an urban legend about mechanical home buttons wearing out and reducing the resale value of phones.. View All 14 Photos in Gallery. Whether you think the Taptic home button is weird depends entirely on whether you've used handsets other than iPhones. As a reviewer, I spend most of my year with non-iPhones, so I find it completely normal to use; it feels like a home button. It responds quickly, and you can even tune the haptic response (which is essentially a vibration) to your tastes. The new haptic engine also helps enhance gaming, offering a range of stuttering and buzzing responses to screen taps in general.. Phones are fashion objects, and three new colors join the iPhone array. Jet Black, which is glossy but very grippy, is gorgeous. It's also the world's worst fingerprint magnet. Our Jet Black review unit was impossible to keep pristine — it practically picks up fingerprints out of the air. Matte Black is the far less frustrating (and arguably more attractive) finish. It's much more resistant to scratches and fingerprints, and has a nice, premium feel. A new PRODUCT (RED) model launched in 2017 has a red back panel and edges with a white face. Gold, Rose Gold, and Silver options are also available.. Left to right: iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus. The iPhone 7 line is now water resistant: IP67 certification means you can dunk the phone in shallow water for half an hour. That doesn't mean you should take it swimming, just that you don't have to worry about dropping it in the sink, or well, the toilet. I submerged both iPhone 7s in a bowl of water for 30 minutes with no problems. You can't do that with the iPhone 6s , although you can with the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Apple recommends that you let the Lightning port dry out for five hours after getting it wet before plugging it in again, to prevent short circuits.. Storage options have changed this year, too: they're now 32GB (for $769), 128GB ($869), and 256GB ($969). We suggest the 128GB model for most people, especially if you play games. The latest titles that take advantage of the new hardware, like Lumino City, Transistor, OZ Broken Kingdom, and CSR Racing 2, are all over a gigabyte each. If you capture 4K video, that eats up about 350MB per minute. A 128GB device gives you room to breathe and use the iPhone 7's features to their maximum extent.. Display Superficially, the 5.5-inch, 1,920-by-1,080 screen looks just like last year's model. While Apple says it's 25 percent brighter and displays better colors, side-by-side, I just can't see the difference in under and standard use circumstances. The screen also still pales (often literally) against the rich color and precise text on Samsung's latest AMOLED displays.. But this is another area where lab tests tell a different story than our eyes. Raymond Soneira of DisplayMate Labs says the screen is brighter and less reflective than previous iPhone displays, and mentions a second optional color gamut as a big plus. But that color gamut isn't used by much content yet, making it more of a future feature than a present plus. Folks who found the iPhone 6/6s displays too blue will be pleased by a whiter white point on the iPhone 7, Soneira found.. That said, the Galaxy S7 Edge's AMOLED display is higher resolution, brighter, and has better viewing angles. There are ongoing rumors that Apple will switch to AMOLED displays in the future, but they may just be wishful thinking.. Battery Life Our battery tests don't make it easy to compare iPhones and Android devices. That's because while iPhones tend to have power-hungry screens, Android devices bleed more power in the background. On our standard test, which streams a video over LTE with the screen at full brightness, the iPhone screen's power usage blows away all its other advantages.. So to say that the iPhone 7 Plus gets 6 hours of battery life while the Galaxy S7 Edge gets 10 hours really just reflects that Samsung's AMOLED screen is far more efficient than the iPhone's LCD. That said, the iPhone 7 Plus still gets much longer usage time than the 6s Plus, which clocked in at 4 hours, 11 minutes.. You have to go deeper to find the iPhone's advantages over a new Android phone, for instance, in standby mode. Leaving one of the new iPhones alone for six and a half hours, it only bleeds about one percent of battery, whereas the Galaxy S7 loses nine percent of battery in the same amount of time.. Bluetooth also has less impact on the iPhone. An hour of Bluetooth audio consumed about one percent of the 7 Plus's battery, but four percent of the Galaxy S7's battery.. All of this adds up to a full day of average usage, especially if you turn screen brightness down. Unplugging the iPhone 7 Plus at 8 a.m., I was down to 14 percent batter by 1 a.m. after a long day of heavy use including camera testing. That's pretty great, and the S7 has never lasted that long without invoking its Extreme Power Saving mode.. The phone charges completely in about two and a half hours, which isn't quite up to the standards of Qualcomm's latest fast charging, but is still pretty fast.. A10 Processor, Performance, and Storage Apple's new A10 processor is the fastest processor available on a mobile phone in the US today. I ran some benchmarks and found it to be about 30 percent faster than both the A9 in the iPhone 6s and 40 percent faster than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 in leading Android phones. It has two 2.33GHz "high performance" cores, which are the ones that show up on the benchmarks, and two "low power" cores that use a fifth of the energy the high-performance cores do, and contribute to the iPhone's long battery life with applications like Bluetooth audio. None of the CPU-identifying apps I could find would tell me how fast those secondary cores are.. There's a more powerful GPU in the new phones, too. Apple's phones have always felt fast out of the box, and initially, it's hard to tell the difference between the 6s and the 7 series. (It's much easier to tell the difference between the 6 and the 7, as the 7 is twice as fast at heavy tasks like video exporting.) But differences begin to crop up when playing high-end games. In Riptide GP Renegades, for instance, you see deeper reflections in the water on the iPhone 7 series (at right) than on the 6s (at left), as shown below. These differences will come out more clearly as new applications take better advantage of the new processor.. The iPhone is still, of course, the only model of phone that runs iOS. For more on that, read our full iOS 10 review. iOS is always tuned for the past two years or so of iPhones, and when I loaded it onto several phones for testing, the iPhone 5 and 5s felt quite slow. Not so on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which are very fast.. iOS 10's new home screen widgets can help wean away some Android loyalists, but its real strength, as always, is its tremendous APIs. Camera apps and high-end indie games, for instance, still come out first (and often better) on iOS. You're also guaranteed to get updates, unlike on Android, although three or four years down the road, those updates may slow down your phone. For more, see our Hidden Tips for Mastering iOS 10 .. Left to right: iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 7. There's one big difference between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus in terms of performance, although it didn't show up in benchmarks: While the iPhone 7 has 2GB of RAM, the 7 Plus has 3GB. That should help the 7 Plus's performance when you're flipping between multiple apps.. Modem Apple made a shockingly customer-unfriendly choice this year, choosing to roll back from delivering iPhones compatible with all US carriers. While relatively few people in the US switch carriers with a given device, many want to resell their devices, and all-carrier devices have better resale value.. The Verizon, Sprint, Japanese, and Chinese models of the iPhone use Qualcomm's flagship X12 modem and are compatible with all US carriers. The AT&T, T-Mobile, and European models use the cheaper Intel XMM7360 modem and are not compatible with Verizon or Sprint's networks.. Both modems are faster than the 6s generation, because of their support for 3x carrier aggregation. While the X12 itself supports even newer features like 256 QAM and 4x4 MIMO, which T-Mobile is activating before the end of the year to further boost speeds, industry insiders tell me that these features will be disabled by Apple, possibly so the X12 version isn't seen as superior to the Intel model.. Here's what I found: Yes, the Qualcomm X12 modem is better. But it's probably not enough to matter.. To scientifically test the two modems against one another, you need a network simulator, a very expensive piece of equipment we don't have. The only independent source I know of is the team at Cellular Insights — keep an eye out for their conclusions. It would also help to have iPhone units with both modem types; Apple supplied us only with Intel modems.. So I compared the iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem, with a Samsung Galaxy S7 with a Qualcomm X12 modem, on the T-Mobile network. I took both devices to five locations in New York City and ran tests at each location. The Samsung phone averaged 27.9Mbps down, while the iPhone averaged 26.2Mbps down. The Samsung phone was faster than the iPhone in 9 out of 15 cases.. I followed up by using Ookla Speedtest Intelligence to gather the results from 3,638 Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge tests and 2,052 iPhone 7 and 7 Plus tests taken on September 16 and 17. This kind of crowdsourcing has its own flaws — for instance, it can be skewed by different balances of locations — but it's another signal to look at. (Note: Ookla is owned by Ziff Davis, PCMag.com's parent company.). See How We Test Cell Phones. The Samsung devices, with Qualcomm modems, averaged 29.3Mbps down, while the Apple devices, with Intel modems, averaged 30.3Mbps down. Looking only at fast speeds, 23 percent of the Samsung tests were over 50Mbps, while only 20 percent of the iPhone tests were over 50Mbps. But that's too small a difference to matter much, given all the other variables at play.. This is where a common theme comes in: Geek cred versus real-life differences. The X12 is a better modem, but the XMM7360 is apparently good enough, and Apple decided that good enough (and cheaper) is just fine. That said, if you purchase a full-price Verizon unit from an Apple Store, it will work on all US carriers and sport the better modem.. And how about the iPhone 7 versus previous models? Dipping once again into Speedtest Intelligence, looking at one day's worth of tests on T-Mobile, I found iPhone 5s models averaged 20.3Mbps down, iPhone 6 models averaged 23.7Mbps, iPhone 6s models averaged 27.7Mbps, and iPhone 7 models averaged 30.3Mbps. That is a meaningful difference and a continual performance improvement year on year.. The new iPhones also have significantly better Wi-Fi performance than the 6s, much closer to the Galaxy S7. With a weak signal that pushed the 6s down to the 5-10Mbps range (on a 150Mbps connection), the iPhone 7 series was able to get 40Mbps or more, just like the S7 does. In fact, in all signal conditions, the new iPhones got faster Wi-Fi speeds than the 6s, and the larger iPhone usually showed faster speeds than the smaller one.. The Headphone Jack Dilemma Yes, the iPhone 7 Plus does not have a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. Instead, it has a Lightning port; it comes with Lightning EarPod earbuds and a flimsy, easily misplaced, $9 dongle to adapt standard headphones .. Initially, I didn't think this was a big deal; leave the dongle on your favorite headphones and you're set. Then I realized how many pairs of headphones I have at my house and office, and how I'm used to plugging any pair I want into my phone. The new port started to become a big hassle. Never mind that you can't charge your phone and listen to music at the same time without another dongle or dock. Bluetooth audio is one solution, but Bluetooth is wireless, so there can be connectivity issues. My Bowers & Wilkins P7 Bluetooth headphones had to be re-paired through the iPhone's settings screen every time I turned them off and on again. Apple's AirPods (shown below) and new Beats headphones use a special new pairing technology that looks to be more seamless, but they aren't on the market yet. We'll test them, once they're available.. Also, Bluetooth also won't satisfy true audiophiles, as Apple's implementation transmits music in 256Kbps VBR AAC. That's the same quality as music purchased from the iTunes store — so iTunes tracks are pristine, wirelessly — but lovers of lossless music will be unhappy.. The Lightning port offers a potential audiophile solution, as Lightning headphones can have their own premium DACs for great audio quality. The problem is, while plenty of models have been announced , most aren't on the market yet. That will probably change by the end-of-year holidays.. This is one area where waiting a while is probably wise, especially if you have a lot of headphones lying around. An accessory ecosystem is going to grow up around the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, but it's going to take a few months; we're probably going to see a lot of gear at CES in January.. That in mind, the industry is transitioning away from the headphone jack. Motorola and LeEco came first, dipping their toes in the water. We are very early in this transition, though, and most people will be sticking with standard headphones for a few years yet. This is, in my mind, another reason to stick with the iPhone 6s or SE wired headphone compatibility matters to you.. The dual stereo speakers aren't entirely front-facing: One is in the earpiece and the other is at the bottom right of the phone. But they do deliver noticeably louder, less tinny audio than previous iPhone generations. The iPhone 6s puts out 81 decibels at about three inches away, while the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 deliver 85 dB, and the iPhone 7 Plus (bigger, so bigger speakers) manages 88 dB.. The Camera(s) Both iPhone 7s sport 12-megapixel main cameras with optical image stabilization and 7-megapixel front cameras. Our camera expert Jim Fisher put the new cameras through various lab tests and found that they aren't quite as sharp as the Galaxy S7's camera, although the differences can be hard to tell with the naked eye. They are, however, measurably better than the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus cameras.. I did a different test, taking comparative photos in a range of different real-life circumstances. In good outdoor light, the Galaxy S7's f/1.7 camera gives punchier colors than the iPhone 7 Plus's f/1.8 lens, although the difference is really subtle. I also prefer the Galaxy S7's exposure metering to the iPhone's. In several macro images of flowers, the iPhone blew out the image by default, while the Galaxy S7 captured more highlights. The Galaxy S7 won the day with my outdoor shots.. But as you'd expect, with good light (shown below), the iPhone's 2x optical zoom gives significantly more detail than the Samsung camera does using digital zoom. The iPhone's 7-megapixel selfie camera also captures noticeably more than the Galaxy S7's 5-megapixel unit and previous iPhone models, although that isn't always flattering.. Excellent optical image stabilization means the iPhone 7's main camera pulls ahead of the Galaxy S7. Our lab tests show the Galaxy S7 as sharper in low light, but as those tests are done while mounted on a tripod, they don't take the blurriness caused by shaky hands into account. In our real-life tests, that makes a difference in the iPhone's favor. It largely comes down to the blurriness caused by shaky hands on low shutter speeds. While the Galaxy S7's low-light images show a little blur at 1/30 or 1/40 second, the iPhone's images of stationary subjects are clearer at 1/15 second. The image stabilization more than counters Samsung's wider f/1.7 aperture.. The iPhone's 2x zoom camera isn't nearly as good in low light, though, as it has a narrower f/2.8 aperture and isn't optically stabilized. The Galaxy S7 takes clearer shots than the iPhone's zoom camera in low light.. Shots above taken with the main camera, showing that the iPhone's images look a bit better in low light.. But here's part of Apple's genius. Sometimes its strength isn't in technical solutions, it's in usability. Having that 1x zoom button in the camera app made me much more likely to zoom images on the iPhone 7 Plus than on other phones, where you have to pinch to zoom and be careful about how much you pinch. Apple is bringing zoom to the masses not through a second camera, but through a few convenient pixels on the screen.. And the iPhone 7 Plus is the best mobile video camera on the market, because unlike the Galaxy S7, it doesn't put an artificial 10-minute limit on 4K recordings. Apple's superior APIs also mean there are some terrific third-party video camera apps, like Flimic Pro, which simply aren't matched on Android.. What excites me the most about the dual cameras isn't what they do now; it's what they could do in the future. Apple has promised (but not yet delivered) bokeh, a trick involving short depth-of-field that blurs the background of images while keeping the foreground sharp. There's going to be a dual-camera API. That means we could start to see stereo depth-sensing and augmented reality applications using the camera. Tim Cook told Good Morning America he's interested in augmented reality , and the iPhone 7 Plus could be the first step into that realm — although probably not at least until iOS 11 next year.. Comparisons and Conclusions There's a simple question this year: Are the iPhone 7's new features worth the headphone jack hassle? Especially right now, when there aren't many Lightning headphones available and Bluetooth devices are still divisive.. I think they are — but mostly for the iPhone 7 Plus, not for the iPhone 7. That's because the iPhone 7 Plus has additional future-proofing, including the dual cameras (which may play a role in Apple's augmented-reality dreams, but for now, make your portraits look terrific) and the extra RAM, which will help with new versions of iOS. That all balances out the annoyance of a few months of waiting for the headphone world to catch up.. I also still strongly recommend the iPhone SE. There's no other phone on the market that manages its level of quality in a 4-inch phone. At $449 for the 64GB unit, it saves you at least $100 over the iPhone 6s and $200 over the iPhone 7, and its A9 processor is just as good as the one in the 6s. Our upgrade recommendations are as follows in the chart at right.. In terms of very large phones, the Android world has the LG V20 and a new Google Nexus on the horizon, but they aren't quite here yet. As of this writing, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is banned on airlines and most public transportation, making it an impractical choice even if it doesn't explode. That makes the iPhone 7 Plus, with its fast processor, high-quality display, and dual cameras, your best bet — and our Editors' Choice — for large phones. The iPhone 7 is still highly rated, and a good upgrade if you have an iPhone 6 or earlier. I'd rather wait a little while for the headphone ecosystem to catch up there, though. In that medium size, our Editors' Choice remains the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, with its better camera, modem, and screen, and traditional headphone jack.. Bottom Line: Absence of headphone jack aside, the 7 Plus is the best iPhone you can buy, with more memory than its smaller counterpart and dual cameras that peer toward Apple's future..

Now with the extra unit of a speaker, the iPhone 7 Plus gives 50% louder audio output.. The home button now uses force-touch technology instead of the physical mechanism; that means now it only gives the sensation of being pressed without actually being pressed inside with the help of its haptic engine.. Gone is the old 3.5mm audio jack that was used to connect your earphones. Apple has taken a big step to skip the audio jack and instead use its Lightning connector to power the headphones. Although Apple is providing a lighting to 3.5mm adapter in the box for those who want to connect their existing earphones with 3.5mm audio jack.

Editor's note : CNET has fully reviewed the Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. What follows below is our initial hands-on impressions of the iPhone 7 Plus.. Click here for our full iPhone 7 Plus review.. The new pair of Apple flagships have finally been announced. But if you want dual cameras, you'll only get them in the Plus.. During a San Francisco event today held at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, the tech giant unveiled the iPhone 7 , the 7 Plus and the company's second wearable, the Apple Watch Series 2. The device will start at $769 for 32GB, but 128GB and 256GB variants will be available. Pre-orders begin September 9 and units will ship out September 16.. The 7 Plus shares many attributes as its 7 counterpart, including its new dust- and water-resistant design, stereo speakers and a lack of a headphone jack. But as Apple's slightly more premium handset, the device is equipped with a bigger display and three cameras total (including a 12-megapixel telephoto lens).. It's a funny thing about the Plus: it used to be about having a bigger screen and more battery life, but the claimed battery gains between the 7 Plus and smaller iPhone 7 aren't all that great. The 7 Plus, this time, is mostly about having a dual rear camera.. iPhone 7 Plus in photos: Your first look at Apple's new flagship. The Plus looks just like the older iPhone 6S Plus , which isn't much of a surprise. However, the dual lenses do steal the show and are the most compelling feature about the phone. They show notable improvements in the speed of snapping photos during our brief time with the handset.. Snapping between both lenses was easy, and the single-touch zoom wheel in the camera app made software zoom a piece of cake. But I didn't get to try depth of field effects, which won't be available until an update later this year.. The rest of the Plus is really about its internal specs, including performance and battery life. As such, these upgrades are invisible, and any improvements we anticipate will have to be tested and included in our review at a later date. For now, what we can see immediately (other than the two cameras) is that the headphone jack really is gone, which evokes a lot of pretty sad feelings. And the new home button takes getting used to: the click is gone, and it's now replaced with a haptic buzz. It could be a lot better than the traditional home button (and more durable), but we kinda miss that physical click.. Apple seems intent on making the Plus the ultimate camera phone, more so than previous years. For that alone, it's probably worth the step up for anyone who's taking photos all the time professionally.. iPhone 7 Plus' two rear cameras.. *Jet black only comes in the 128GB and 256GB sizes..

Software Pricing and competition Daily usage experiences and conclusion. Similar to how the Galaxy S7 Edge perfected the design and features of the Galaxy S6 Edge, the new Apple iPhone 7 Plus perfects the iPhone 6s Plus design as we look to 2017 when Apple may offer a significant design change.. The Apple 7 Plus brings a faster A10 processor, water resistance, stereo speakers, more RAM, more internal storage capacity for the same prices, best LCD available on a phone , improved front-facing camera, secondary telephoto camera lens, and more battery capacity. These are all welcome improvements found in a familiar shell.. Those in the enterprise looking for a responsive performing phone with wide range of connectivity, very long battery life, ability to withstand the elements, and assurance that updates will come quickly should definitely consider the Apple iPhone 7 Plus.. CNET's Scott Stein awarded the Apple iPhone 7 Plus an 8.8 out of 10.. The iPhone 7 Plus has the exact same length, width, and thickness specification as the iPhone 6s Plus. It is actually 4 grams lighter too, while having a larger capacity battery, more RAM, and another rear camera.. The addition of water resistance is welcome for those times when you accidentally drop your phone in the water, want to use it in heavy rain, or workout with it and have an excessive amount of sweat. You still should not swim with it or attempt to dump champagne all over it as water damage is not covered under warranty and it is not intended for prolonged submergence.. I always found the iPhone to have one of the loudest speakers, which were great for podcasts in the car and speakerphone calls. Apple now has stereo speakers, with the same placement as the HTC 10. Audio sounds great and sharing videos with associates is a better experience with this setup.. Let's get the headphone jack removal out of the way first since that seems to be the most radical hardware design change found on the new Apple iPhone 7 Plus. While Apple removed the headphone jack, it does provide a Lightning port to 3.5mm adapter in the box to help with the transition. It's a small adapter and if you are going to be using wired headphones it's not really an issue to extend your preferred headset a couple of inches by keeping the adapter attached at all times.. Incredibly fast and powerful, with improved low-light camera. Is Apple pushing the smartphone forward, or only doing enough to get by?. Apple also included its standard earbuds in the package, this time with a Lightning port connector on the end of the cables. While it may be a bit inconvenient, if Apple really needed the space inside for a larger battery, water resistance, a second camera, and stereo speakers then I think it was a valid design decision.. The iPhone 7 Plus looks and feels like an iPhone 6s Plus. I am very pleased to see the return of an actual black color as I never really embraced space gray. I bought the matte black one and prefer that over the jet black ones my daughters chose. Unlike my Note 7, I don't have to wipe the back clean all day as fingerprints don't show up and the matte black just looks great.. Matte black Apple iPhone 7 Plus: hardware... 1 - 5 of 26. The display resolution has not changed, but honestly the fonts are crisp, photos and videos look amazing, and I am fine with a 1080p display on a smartphone. To save a bit of battery life, I have my Note 7 set to 1080p and cannot tell a difference between that and 2K resolution. The iPhone 7 Plus display is also the best smartphone LCD DisplayMate has ever tested and users will be pleased with its wide color gamut, brightness, and low screen reflectance.. The power and volume buttons remain in the same place on the right and left, the SIM card slot is still found below the power button, and the Lightning port is centered on the bottom. The handset speaker serves as one of the two stereo speakers with the other found down on the bottom right where the mono speaker was previously positioned. Audio has always been loud on the iPhone and I'm really enjoying the stereo speaker experience as I share videos with family.. There are still rather large bezels above and below the display with side bezels also present. The Note 7 dual edge display without bezels lets Samsung provide a larger display in a smaller form factor. I hope to see this as one major design change from Apple in 2017.. The larger Apple iPhone battery has always been impressive, largely due to Apple's incredible standby power management. I was always able to get through a full, long day with the iPhone 6s Plus and so far am seeing about the same with the iPhone 7 Plus. It's a phone I can leave the house with at 4:45 am and then place on the charger at 11 pm without having to charge it up.. Apple's awesome battery life is one reason that the lack of fast charging and wireless charging don't concern me as much as they would if an Android smartphone did not have these functions. I would still love to see both in the next iPhone, but also prefer the metal back so can give up on my wireless charging desire.. Apple usually makes some kind of incremental upgrade to its cameras with new devices and while the 12 megapixel sensor did see an upgrade in aperature, from f/2.2 to f/1.8, performance seems about the same as the 6s Plus .. The addition of a second camera is new for Apple. We've seen Huawei, LG, and HTC include dual cameras on phones with different uses for that second camera. The second rear Apple camera, unfortunately only found on the larger 7 Plus, is also a 12 megapixel camera. It has a f/2.8 aperture and a telephoto lens. You can perform a 2x optical zoom action with this camera, which can be handy for some situations.. Check out my Flickr photo album for full size images comparing the iPhone 7 Plus with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7.. The second camera will also be used to capture portrait photos with bokeh effects. This isn't provided in the software at launch, but I'm also testing out the public beta to try out portrait mode.. Over the past year, I have come to the realization that water resistance needs to be near the top of my must-have list for smartphone features. I like to take photos when I run, make calls in any weather condition, and use my phone when environmental conditions may not be the best. The addition of water resistance, IP67 standard, was one reason I bought the iPhone 7 Plus and if Apple had not included it I may not have purchased the phone. These modern flagship phones are too expensive to let an accident kill the device.. Prior to the release of the iPhone 7 Plus, I installed iOS 10 public preview on my iPhone 6s Plus. There are a few usability changes in iOS 10, related to notifications, lock screen widgets, and the implementation of 3D Touch.. In iOS 9 on an iPhone 6s Plus I found the fingerprint scanner to be so fast that I never saw the lock screen and was unable to use the camera shortcut. It's a bit jarring at first to now have to press down on the new fingerprint scanner/home button to get to the home screen. The home button isn't really a button either as it is similar to the HTC 10 capacitive button, but with a stronger vibration feedback mechanism.. iOS 10 public preview: screenshot galler... 1 - 5 of 9. Now that a press is required, but not too much or you will launch Siri, Apple has added more to the lock screen as you will likely be seeing it more in iOS 10. Notifications can be viewed when the display turns on with a swipe from left to right taking you to your widgets and one from right to left launching the camera. You can take actions on the notifications as well, depending on your security settings.. On the main home screen a swipe from left to right takes you to the widget panel, which can also be accessed by swiping down from the top and then left to right. Notifications appear by default with a swipe down from the top. If you want to quick search your iPhone, then a simple short swipe down from an empty area on the launcher will open up the search utility.. There are many more developers providing support for 3D Touch so try it out all over to discover new functionality. Make sure to use a 3D Touch action on the blue arrow in Messages to discover new ways to interact with contacts.. While iOS 10 appears very familiar at first, there are also many changes that can make your iOS experience a bit confusing and overwhelming. The good thing is that additional functionality is not required to use the device so these advanced options should appeal to the tinkerer while the standard interface will appeal to the long time iOS user.. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus remains the most expensive smartphone available today with prices ranging from $749 to $949. Thankfully, the resale value for the iPhone line remains very high so there is a good resale market while Apple and US carriers also offer payment and contract options.. The competition for the new iPhone 7 Plus includes the Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy Note7, the LG V20, and the HTC 10. Android has come a long way and manufacturers have improved the cameras while pushing the limits of mobile technology. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 suffered a major setback with the battery failure, but the devices are being replaced and the Note 7 still offers serious competition to the iPhone 7 Plus at a similar price point.. The first thing I noticed when I opened the iPhone 7 Plus box was the black matte finish. It looks stunning, hiding the antenna lines, minimizing fingerprints, and offering a phone that appears clean and modern.. I get out of bed around 4:30 am and don't lie back down until 10:00 pm or later most nights. During these long days, I push my phones with podcasts, social media, spreadsheet use, email and voice communications, photo and video capture, and more. The iPhone 7 Plus has been able to get through a full, long day with my standard usage without a problem. It beats every phone I have tried when it comes to battery life.. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus has been a screamer, flawlessly bouncing in and out of apps with no delays or pausing. Scrolling up and down is seamless and it's been a real pleasure having such a responsive phone.. The camera has performed similarly to the 6s Plus and the beta portrait mode is providing some good results. I filmed some clips at a Train concert on Sunday and the results were great with good quality images and clear sound.. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent phone that provides users with a fast, reliable platform. The hardware may not visibly be revolutionary, but the internal improvements and the continued advancement of iOS 10 make it an amazing smartphone.. The stereo speakers, water resistance, long battery life, matte black finish, and solid third party app experience make the iPhone 7 Plus a device I will happily keep using for the next year..

The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running..

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $560 Buy. $499 Buy.

Listed Price : 61,060. The new Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are here. The new smartphones bring faster hardware, new features and improvements over last year’s iPhones. For now, let’s focus on the iPhone 7 Plus. Prices start at Rs 72,000 for 32GB version, Rs 82,000 for 128GB version and Rs 92,000 for the 256GB version. This time around, you have five different colors to choose from - rose. gold, gold, silver, black and jet. Let us first begin with the design. At first glance, the iPhone 7 Plus looks similar to last year’s iPhone 6s Plus. The difference here can be noticed when you turn to the back of the smartphone – the dual-camera setup, which is also its main highlight. The ugly antenna bands at the back have now been pushed along the top and bottom edges of the smartphone, thus giving it a cleaner look. You may think why buy the new iPhone 7 Plus when it looks similar to last year’s iPhone 6s Plus, but there are enough under the hood tweaks that you get.. Unlike previous iPhones, the Touch ID fingerprint sensor is no more clickable. It’s a capacitive touch button, and comes with Apple’s Force Touch technology. It uses a haptic feedback to simulate the feel of a button. Apple has also removed the traditional 3.5mm audio jack and it is now using the Lightning connector for charging, data transfer and audio. The EarPods headset you get with the smartphone now have the Lightning connector port. Apple has also bundled a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter for those who still want to use their old headphones with legacy 3.5mm audio port.. The iPhone 7 Plus also comes with stereo speakers, where the earpiece now acts as the secondary speaker when you’re playing songs or watching videos. Apple says that the new speaker system is twice as loud as the iPhone 6s. What’s more, just like the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, the iPhone 7 also boasts certification for water and dust resistance. The IP67 certification means you can submerge the smartphone under one meter of water for up to 30 minutes without harming it.. It flaunts a 5.5-inch full HD (1920x1080 pixels) LED display with pixel density of 401ppi. The screen comes with wider color gamut to display more vibrant, cinema standard colors. Apple also says that the new panel is up to 25 percent brighter than iPhone 6s. It has also retained 3D Touch feature from iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. At the heart of iPhone 7 Plus runs the A10 Fusion 64-bit quad-core processor paired with M10 co-processor and 3GB of RAM, which Apple claims is two times faster than the A8 chipset. There is also a hexa-core GPU to boost graphic performance by up to three times compared to the iPhone 6.. Like always, Apple has worked on the camera aspect of the smartphone to bring the photo quality closer to that of DSLR cameras. One of the key features of the iPhone 7 Plus is its dual camera setup at the back. It includes a 12-megapixel camera lens (28mm) of aperture f/1.8 with optical image stabilization (OIS) and another 12-megapixel telephoto lens (56mm) of aperture f/2.8. The secondary camera can add DSLR-like bokeh effects in portrait mode, and it also supports 2X optical zoom, and 10X digital zoom. The camera also lets you capture 4K videos at 30fps and slow motion full HD videos at 120fps, and slow motion HD videos at 240fps.. While Apple didn’t reveal the battery capacity of iPhone 7 Plus, teardowns have revealed a 2,900mAh one. Apple claims that the new iPhones offer the best battery life ever, with music playback of 60hours, 3G talktime of 21 hours and 3G standby of 284 hours.. On the connectivity front, you get Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC. Apple has also included an advance LTE chipset to offer faster data download speeds of up to 450Mbps, which is twice as fast as iPhone 6s Plus and three times faster than iPhone 6 Plus. With 4G LTE and VoLTE HD voice calling support, Apple has also included support for up to 25 network bands to offer best roaming experience when you roam across counties.. On the software front, the iPhone 7 Plus runs on the iOS 10 out-of-the-box.. The iOS 10 is a major upgrade that brings a revamped lockscreen with rich text notifications, expanded 3D Touch for quick interaction with apps, Siri integration with apps such as WeChat, WhatsApp and more. There is new QuickType keyboard that uses deep learning techniques, functional Photos app, Apple Maps with redesigned interface, and iMessage with end-to-end encryption to keep your conversations secure, as well as fun stuff like bubble effect and invisible ink. It also comes with an App Store of its own from where users can download more apps and stickers.. Apple iPhone 8 Plus review: The best.

<span class="i19ndropdownplus new-window" data-url="http://www.stuffmideast.com/">Stuff Middle East</span>. <span class="i19ndropdownplus new-window" data-url="http://www.stuff.co.za">STUFF South Africa</span>. The new Product (RED) version adds more colour - here are our thoughts. We are part of The Trust Project. Fact: things are better when they come in pairs.. The rozzers would have a hard time arresting anyone with a single handcuff. Good luck knitting that ugly Christmas jumper with only one needle. And as if a solitary KitKat finger could ever last your entire tea break.. The particular pair we’re interested in, though? The two cameras pointing out the back of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus.. What used to just be a plus-sized version of the vanilla iPhone has now fully stolen the spotlight from its smaller brother , thanks to some clever camera tech. Combine it with all the other tweaks and upgrades Apple has made for 2016, and you’re going to find yourself needing bigger pockets - because this is now the best iPhone out there.. APPLE IPHONE 7 PLUS CAMERA: DOUBLE TROUBLE. Dual cameras are nothing new: Huawei’s got a secondary black-and-white sensor on the P9 , LG went wide-angle for the G5 , and HTC had depth-of-field fanciness in the One M8.. Apple’s approach for the iPhone 7 Plus? One sensor for close-up snaps, and another for zooming in on the action. It's a genius idea that has a genuine effect on the shots you take. So how does it work? Well, hop into the camera app and you’ll find a new 1x icon at the bottom of the screen. Tap it and you’ll switch from the f/1.8 wide angle sensor to the f/2.8 telephoto, for 2x optical zoom. You can tap and hold, then drag up or down to digitally zoom in up to 10x.. Optical image stabilisation goes a long way to keeping your shots steady, even when you’re zoomed in, so you’ll be able to pap unsuspecting wildlife without spooking them, or get closer to the action at a gig without having to brave the moshpit.. Bear in mind though that the optical zoom only works up to 2x, and that even Apple’s legendary image processing can’t rescue the detail that gets lost once you start dialling up the digital zoom. results at 10x look a bit too fuzzy to print, especially when you’re in the middle of a crowd of EDM ravers, but it’s still handy to use as a set of mobile binoculars.. Zoom also works when filming video, but only at 2x optical and 6x digital magnifications. That's fine though, because whereas the pinch-to-zoom feature on last year’s iPhones could leave your footage looking shakier than something out of the Blair Witch Project , you'll now have two hands to steady the phone. That, combined with OIS, really smoothes out video recording.. It helps that iOS 10 lets you swipe the lockscreen to the left to jump straight into the camera app now, too. The sizable Plus was prone to toppling over with the old swipe up gesture, but you can now keep a firm grip on it when you’re getting ready to snap that perfect selfie.. Apple iPhone 7 Plus camera sample photos. Unfortunately, the camera app’s Portrait mode, which Apple reckons puts its phones on par with DSLR cameras (yeah right, Apple. We'll be the judge of that), isn’t yet available.. It could be a killer feature if it works, creating convincing depth of field effects and beautiful bokeh, but we’re staying sceptical for now. Other phones have tried, and failed, to do something similar. We’ll update this review once we’ve spent some time with it.. Overall picture quality is staggering at times, with the wide f/1.8 aperture really helping the 12MP wide-angle sensor capture loads of light with every tap of the shutter button. There’s an impressive amount of detail, even compared to the higher resolution Android competition, and the fact that you can now shoot in RAW gives you more control over the editing process.. Low light can’t spoil the fun either. The iPhone 6s Plus could be a bit like Donald Trump searching for common sense, struggling to get a fix on something right in front of it, but focusing is a lot faster now. Noise still creeps in a little, but night photos look better than ever. The TrueTone flash has also been boosted with two extra LEDs, so you’ll be able to light up even the darkest scenes.. It’s easily one of the best smartphone cameras around right now, and one which gives the Samsung Galaxy S7 a real run for its money.. APPLE IPHONE 7 PLUS DISPLAY: SEE THE LIGHT. The reason all your photos look so damn good on that 5.5in display is that they’re both shot and shown in a wide colour gamut. That doesn’t just mean more colours, but also more lifelike ones - so you get greater vibrancy, without deviating from how a scene actually looked when you pressed the shutter button.. It's also the brightest iPhone screen yet, with a 25% boost to peak brightness which means you can now read the screen in direct sunlight.. Yep, there's finally no need to run for shade whenever a WhatsApp message comes through.. It hasn’t had a resolution bump, in line with Apple’s feelings on Retina displays, but that's not a major problem. Images and text still look sharp enough, even stretched over 5.5in, so while it falls behind the QHD Android competition on paper, you won’t notice the difference in the real world unless you really look for it.. Samsung’s screen tech still has the upper hand when it comes to Netflix-binges thanks to the deep blacks and incredible contrast you only really get with OLED panels, but this is at least the best iPhone screen yet. And we'll just have to wait for the iPhone 8 Plus for OLED, eh?. Meanwhile, Apple’s 3D Touch pressure-sensitive screen tech is now that little bit more useful thanks to iOS 10. Most of the major apps now feature pop-up menus which allow you to jump straight into the bit you want - the kind of change that you won't fully appreciate until you use it regularly.. For a more detailed look at iOS 10, make sure to read our full review here .. IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY. APPLE IPHONE 7 PLUS AUDIO: JACK IT IN. The Plus has excellent sound to back up the stellar screen, with stereo speakers finally finding their way into an iPhone for the first time (or second if you count the fact that they're also included on the smaller iPhone 7). They can pump out impressively loud audio, and don’t sound half-bad either - no need to grab your back-up ’buds when you want to watch a YouTube video.. Sound has taken a hit in another area, though: the headphone port. It’s gone, ditched in favour of Apple’s Lightning port. That means lugging around a clunky 3.5mm adapter if you want to use your existing set of cans, or cutting the cord altogether with Bluetooth.. Is it an annoying move? Abso-tootly. Is it the only phone to lose it? Nope, Android phones such as the Moto Z have ditched it too. Is it the end of the world? Nah, not really.. The ugly adapter is almost definitely going to get lost, and the number of people using Apple EarPods on the morning commute are probably going to skyrocket given that there’s a Lightning-equipped pair in the box, but the grumbling will stop eventually. Besides, Bluetooth headphones are really good these days.. Apple IPHONE 7 PLUS Design: BACK IN BLACK. Aside from the MIA headphone port, you’d be hard-pressed to pick the iPhone 7 Plus from a lineup of 6S Pluses - well, from the front at any rate.. There’s barely any difference at all, with the biggest being that the Home button isn’t actually a button now. It’s still got fingerprint-sensing TouchID smarts that work just as swiftly as those on last year’s phone, but it now sits flush to the phone.. To make up for it no longer being a proper pressable button, it's been kitted out with Apple’s Taptic engine, a feature which first showed up in the new Macbook trackpad and Apple Watch .. Here it uses haptic feedback to. mimic the feel of an actual click - and it mostly works. It’ll definitely take some getting used to - mainly due to it feeling as if you’re clicking in the whole bottom of the phone, rather than just the button. But y ou can tweak it to make it more or less ‘clicky’, and we suspect that after a few weeks with it you'll barely remember a time when it felt any different.. Flip the iPhone 7 Plus over, of course, and you’ll instantly spot the twin camera sensors, along with the stealthy antenna lines that have been bumped closer to the top and bottom.. Compared to the ultra-glossy Jet Black iPhone 7, the matte black 7 Plus does a great job of hiding fingerprints. You won’t be constantly wiping it down, making it the perfect colour to pick if you’re the low maintenance type. Old favourites Silver, Gold and Rose Gold all make a return too.. The biggest of all changes to the iPhone 7 Plus' build, though, is one you won't actually be able to spot: it's waterproof. Yes, you can now, finally, give the iPhone a bit of a dunking. Like its little brother, the iPhone 7 Plus is IP67 water-resistant, which means it can be submerged in up to 1m of water for up to 30 minutes.. You're unlikely to do that with it - what would be the point? - but more realistically you'll be able to soundtrack your shower with a Spotify singalong. And even more realistically, an accidental trip down the U-bend won’t mean a trip back to the Apple Store.. The newest addition to the iPhone 7 line-up is the stunning Product (RED) special edition. It swaps Apple’s usually restrained metallic colours for a gorgeous crimson hue.. The shiny rear is just as resistant to fingerprints as other iPhone models (Jet Black version excluded, which is an absolute magnet for the things) but not everyone will appreciate the white glass front. We reckon it would have looked even meaner if Apple had gone for black glass instead.. It’s the first time Apple has given an iPhone the red treatment (having previously stuck to iPods and cases). You won’t have to pay any extra for one, but with a portion of each sale going towards HIV and AIDS charities in Africa, you can feel that little bit better about splashing so much cash on a brand new smartphone.. Plus, you’re guaranteed to stand out from the rest of the black, silver, gold and rose gold-buying crowd.. APPLE IPHONE 7 PLUS power and battery: speed demon. It might be big and bulky compared to the svelte iPhone 7, but there's no way you can call the iPhone 7 Plus slow or sluggish. The four-core A10 Fusion chip inside makes sure things always feel instantly responsive, whether handling apps, multitasking, adding camera effects or even enjoying a spot of Pokemon-catching.. It’s no slouch when it comes to games, either, keeping even demanding titles such as Riptide GP2 and Asphalt 8 ticking along at a healthy frame-rate. Indeed, the holy trinity of screen real estate, stereo speakers and haptic feedback makes this one of the best phones for gaming out there.. Most importantly of all, that huge amount of power doesn’t come at the expense of battery life. More than halfway through the day we still had a very reassuring 51% left - despite the phone having been in constant use since we woke up.. This is a handset that will carry you from day to night without you needed to plug it in, and when you do eventually hit that worrying 20%. there's the option of turning on Low Power Mode -. which should tide you through post-work drinks. And anyway, you shouldn't be using your phone so much in social situations. Storage is a bit more of a mixed bag. On the one hand, ditching the entry-level 16GB model was absolutely the right move - it was a nightmare having to delete apps or wipe off music every time an iOS update arrived.. A more spacious 256GB model will appease media hoarders, too, as long as they’ve got the cash to cover it, but dropping the 64GB option in favour of 128GB means there’s no middle ground sweet spot any more. It would have been great to have had four choices here, but instead you either make do with 32GB or spend significantly more to jump up to 128GB.. Regardless of capacity, you’ll be looking at the business end of a £700+ bill to take one home - the Apple premium is real, people.. The camera has always been one of the iPhone’s greatest weapons against the encroaching army of rapidly improving Android handsets, and the substantial upgrade Apple has squeezed into the iPhone 7 Plus makes it a no-brainer for mobile photographers.. Waterproofing is a welcome touch, bringing it on par with Sony and Samsung phones, and it’s a performance powerhouse when it comes to apps and games. Add in a better battery and you’ve got a clear winner over the vanilla iPhone 7.. Sure, it loses out on paper in a head-to-head with Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 , which has a stylus and a better display for less cash , but if you’re firmly entrenched in camp iOS, it’s time to go big or go home. The iPhone 7’s camera might be improved, but the iPhone 7 Plus’ snapper offers a lot more to play with. So unless you're totally against big screens, this is the iPhone you should buy.. The 10 best smartphones in the world right now. 2x 12MP rear (f/1.8 wide-angle, f/2.8 telephoto) w/ OIS and TrueTone flash, 7MP front.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 1.0 out of 5 stars Please don't Buy it. It is a Fake Product !!!. Color: Black | Size: 128 GB | Verified Purchase. Recently I have purchased this product from ADZ1 and had the worst experience ever. Everything went very well, including delivery which was pretty fast. But once I put my hands on the product the frustrations started. Not only the product IS NOT ORIGINAL but lots of other items were suspicious as well, such as: - The software is not from Apple. Rather, it is a almost identical replica of the iOS software. For dummy users, it is easy to be fooled since the screen, commands and way to operate is the same. Luckily enough I work with IT (Software Development) and I could testify that the O.S running on the phone was a fake one with jailbreak. Even the option to reset all the settings to the factory wasn't present. Rather, the user has a choice to access the command line to perform administrative tasks. Not in this world that this would be Apple software. - The language came all in Chinese, which indicates that either the phone came from there or has been used before - since newly iPhones gives you the ability to set up the phone when first started. As soon a turn the phone on I was presented with the pos-configured software already in Chinese. - The phone also didn't identified my provider. The seller says that the phone is unlocked (reason why he/she asks for a few bucks extra in the price) but it wasn't able to detect my AT&T card. Strangely enough, once I inserted my AT&T card the phone "automagically" changed the language from Chinese to English, although no reception. Instead of the plastic that covers up the entire box in case of originals, the box sent to be was missing the plastic. Not only this is unethical but proves that the product is not original. - Inside the box I could check that all items supposed to come with the phone were there. However, I noticed that the charger plug had scratches all over the plug which was a clear indication that someone deliberately created that box with items from different phones. Even the ear plugs was not properly wrapped in the box. I returned the product and less than one week I could have my money back since Amazon issued me an refund. Therefore not a complete waste of money. The only damage was in my experience buying an expensive product from Amazon, that allowed a seller like ADZ1 to be able to offer its fake products. Although I am pretty sure that Amazon cannot control this (and thus is not Amazon's fault) maybe this experience could be used to testify that ADZ1 is not reliable. You guys made my experience less painful!. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Received a fake iphone. Color: Silver | Size: 128 GB | Verified Purchase.

http:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=18200. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus offers a few tricks that the smaller iPhone 7 doesn't. I particularly like how the dual cameras work together and how the larger power cell pushes battery life past a single day. Together with iOS 10, the iPhone 7 Plus is a formidable smartphone, even if it's hard to distinguish from its predecessors. Like its smaller sibling, the iPhone 7 Plus follows closely in the footsteps of Apple's most recent iPhones. The chassis looks almost identical to the iPhone 6s Plus, but the entire spec sheet has been overhauled with some new and exciting features. If your previous Apple smartphone is aging and a replacement is in order, then perhaps the iPhone 7 Plus will be right up your alley. On the other hand, if your iPhone 6s Plus is still functioning fine, then you may want to stick with it until next year's 10-year-anniversary iPhone.. Editor's Note: Because the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are so similar, much of the text in this review is carried over from our review of the iPhone 7. Rest assured, we updated this review to reflect the actual performance and capabilities of the iPhone 7 Plus, which we tested fully.. Apple introduced minimal design changes for the iPhone this year, but those changes are just enough to ensure that the new device isn't compatible with many existing iPhone 6s Plus accessories. The company has broken from its traditional tick-tock design cycle, wherein in introduces a brand new form factor one year followed by a spec bump the next year, with a tick-tock- tock design that is largely identical to the previous two phones.. Last year, I complained that Apple's recycled designs are lazy and I feel no differently this year. In fact, I'm even more aggravated that Apple isn't offering its customers something entirely new in 2016. Apple, once the design leader, has allowed its rivals to catch up and in some cases even surpass the iPhone in terms of design. You may love the design of the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus. If you do, then you'll be happy with the iPhone 7 Plus.. (If you're wondering why Apple hasn't given the iPhone a fresh design since 2014, many believe the company has a radically new phone on deck for 2017, the 10-year anniversary of the original iPhone. Of course, that's pure conjecture for now.). The primary physical differences between the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 6s Plus are the dual camera module, the dropped 3.5mm headphone jack, the waterproof casing, and the altered colors. Otherwise, the phones share nearly identical footprints, shapes, and appearance. In fact, the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus have the exact same measurements (length, width, depth), but the 7 Plus does weigh a bit less. Even so, those fancy cases for your iPhone 6 Plus or 6s Plus won't fit the new model because the camera shape and location has shifted. You'll have to buy new cases. The phone is made from aluminum and glass. The metal shell forms the entire rear panel and wraps around to form the side edges. The glass front surface has a slight curve along the edges to help smooth out the joint between two materials. Apple was able to eliminate the two antenna lines that ran across the back of the older 6 and 6s Plus, so the back surface of the 7 Plus is a more complete metal panel. Antenna lines do remain at the top and bottom of the rear panel. They aren't visible on the black models, but can be spotted easily on the other colors. The rounded corners and smoothed-over shape give the phone a somewhat generic look The iPhone 5 and 4 had more personality as far as I'm concerned. There's no doubt the iPhone 7 Plus is a finely-crafted phone, but it's a familiar device that is no longer unique.. The iPhone 7 Plus is the larger of the two iPhones and it stretches beyond one-handed use. The 5.5-inch screen makes the iPhone 7 Plus a bulky flagship that is bigger than many competing devices and awkward to use. I could not reach the entire screen with my thumb without shifting my grip. There's no getting around the expansive footprint of this phone. The curved side edges are smooth against your skin, but the flat rear panel doesn't help the phone find a comfortable home deep in your palm. The iPhone 7 Plus fits into pockets, but is noticeable as you move around throughout your day. (Seriously, you have to be careful getting into cars.) Adding a case only makes it bigger.. The materials and build quality are top notch, and I expected nothing less. I was pleased with the feel of the metal and glass, which are fitted together perfectly. These phones come across as expensive (and they are!) But Apple now has plenty of company when it comes to quality. Samsung and HTC are easily on par with Apple, and others, such as Huawei, OnePlus, and ZTE, are breathing down Apple's neck.. Apple is selling the 7 Plus in jet black (glossy), regular black (matte), silver, gold, and rose gold. The first two options have black glass on front, while the other three have white glass. The earpiece, user-facing camera, and a small sensor are plainly visible above the display. The home button / fingerprint sensor is all but invisible on the black models, while it's called out with a shiny metallic rim on the silver, gold, and rose gold models.. I'm not pleased with the amount of bezel surrounding the display. There are thick lines along the side edges and thick bezels above and below. Looking at the competition, it's clear that you should be getting more screen (or a smaller phone) for your buck. Apple needs to get with the program.. Let's talk about the home button. On every iPhone since 2007, the home button has been a physical key that requires people to press it down. The iPhone 7 Plus trades a physical button for a capacitive one. This forces some behavioral changes upon iPhone owners. The capacitive button works together with a new Taptic Engine inside the phone to provide physical feedback every time you press the button. You can dial in the amount of feedback you receive. I found the first option offered too little feedback while the third option offered too much. The middle option worked best for me. It definitely still feels more like a vibration than a button-press, and it took several days for me to get used to it. By the time I was done writing this review, I had mostly assimilated to the new button, but there's a big "but". (More on that in a bit.). It doesn't help that there are a handful of actions that occur by pressing the home button. A light press wakes the screen. A light press with an extra half-second of pressure will wake the screen and then unlock the phone if you have Touch ID enabled. Last, a double-press opens Apple Pay. Yes, Apple has defined four different actions based on pressing the home button — and we haven't gotten to the accessibility features that are activated with a triple-press. The number of times I accidentally launched Apple Pay when I intended to wake and unlock the iPhone 7 Plus numbered in the dozens over my first few days with the phone. (To be fair, however, I've encountered this same issue with Samsung Pay on Galaxy devices. It was annoying on those devices, too.). As always, the ringer switch is on the top of the left edge. The switch is easy to find and use, and the action is quite good. Few phones have a true ringer switch and it's a nice option to have for quickly switching the ringer to silent/vibrate. The separate volume buttons have good profiles and excellent travel and feedback. They double as shutter buttons when using the camera. I like that the buttons' texture is slightly smoother than the rest of the side edge. The lock button and SIM card tray are housed in the right side of the phone. The 7 Plus's larger size means you often need to slide your thumb up the side to find the screen lock button. Action on the button is perfect. A tool (not included) is required to eject the SIM card.. One of the iPhone 7 Plus's biggest departures from normative smartphone design is the loss of the 3.5mm headphone jack. Surely this is a contentious issue for some and a non-starter for others. Speaking personally, I have switched to Bluetooth headphones for the vast majority of my listening no matter what device I'm using. Even so, I'm still annoyed Apple ditched the jack.. If you want to listen to music via wired headphones, you can use either the included Lightning-tipped earpods (which suck) or the Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter with the regular headphones of your choice. I don't like having to worry about carting the adapter around, especially since I listen to music all over the place. The biggest killer for me is my car: the only AUX input my car has is a 3.5mm jack; it doesn't accept USB-based devices. Apple's decision more or less forces me to carry the adapter around with me everywhere I go. It's one more thing to worry about.. Even if you plan to use the included Lightning earpods, there's still a downside: the iPhone 7 Plus can't charge and play music via the Lightning port at the same time unless you spend extra money on a dock of some sort. Again, this is something I often do in my car.. I'd complain a lot less about this issue if Apple used an industry-standard port, such as USB Type-C. Instead, Apple uses its own, proprietary port that other companies have to pay licensing fees to access.. The bottom edge of the iPhone 7 Plus also has a microphone and speaker. A couple of special screws flank the Lightning port and are plainly visible.. The iPhone 7 Plus's rear panel is perfectly flat, save for the camera module. The module is bigger than ever and protrudes significantly. On the 7 Plus, it accommodates two cameras. A small microphone hole is next to the camera, and the LED flash is next to the mic. This may be a deal breaker for some people, but inaccessible batteries have become de rigueur for today's flagships.. Last, the iPhone 7 Plus is water-resistant. It carries an IP67 rating for protection against dust and water ingress. Technically, it can sit in up to one meter of water for up to 30 minutes with no damage. This does not make the phone worthy of your next barrier reef scuba-diving adventure. It means the iPhone will probably survive a short dunk in the pool, tub, local stream, or toilet. The iPhone 7 Plus is not rugged and the screen is not shatterproof, so don't go dropping it on concrete. I can say that the iPhone had no trouble handling some time under a running faucet, sitting in the river near my house, and resting at the bottom of a sink full of water.. The iPhone 7 Plus is a well-made phone, but is monstrously big. It may be too big for some people. I find the design boring, but you may not. Either way, Apple no longer has a stranglehold on high-quality hardware. I do appreciate the waterproof enclosure, but the loss of the headphone jack is grating all the same.. Like the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus, the iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch display with 1080p full HD pixel resolution. Apple uses LCD panels and the 7 Plus's Retina Display looks great. I found it to be bright enough for use both indoors and out, and it delivers excellent color accuracy. The iPhone's screen offers some of the best viewing angles available, with no brightness or color change. I don't have any issue with the resolution, but it is worth noting that the majority of competing flagship handsets have moved to quad HD, which is far better for virtual reality applications. The iPhone's screen still beats most of the competition in overall quality.. The iPhone 7 Plus is sold in several different wireless configurations. The AT&T/T-Mobile model works with GSM/LTE networks, and the Verizon/Sprint model adds in support for CDMA, too.. I tested the 7 Plus on AT&T's network in the New York City area over the course of several days and it performed above average. The iPhone connected all calls on the first dial and didn't drop/miss any calls. The phone kept a call connected over 30 miles of highway driving, which is no small feat in the NYC area. The iPhone 7 Plus remained attached to AT&T's 4G LTE data network without fail. Not once did it drop the network entirely. The phone didn't drop to 3G, either; even in poor coverage areas it provided 4G LTE service. The iPhone 7 Plus was a champ at streaming YouTube and Spotify and didn't choke on my Instagram feed. Apple has definitely sorted out the wireless technology inside the iPhone so that it is a top performer.. I'm fairly impressed with the iPhone 7 Plus as a voice phone. Calls are generally clear and free of distortion via the earpiece, though I wish voices had a more pleasant timbre. The earpiece generates enough volume to hear calls in most places you're likely to take the phone. I was able to maintain conversations on busy city streets, and even bustling coffee shops and traveling cars couldn't drown out the iPhone 7's earpiece. People I spoke to through the iPhone 7 Plus said I sounded loud and clear.. The speakerphone introduces a small amount of distortion but also kicks out plenty of volume. You can easily use the iPhone at home or the office, in the car or bus/train with no problem.. Ringers and alarms are very loud, and the vibrate alert is excellent.. The iPhone 7 Plus is the first iPhone to boast stereo speakers. (This is probably why the earpiece and speakerphone push out plenty of sound.) There's a small catch: The bottom speaker is easily putting out two times the sound of the earpiece speaker. Music may be stereo, but it isn't balanced. The bottom end of the phone is much, much louder, skewing the sound towards that end of the device. I tested this over and over with many different pieces of music and there's no doubt in my mind: the earpiece doesn't produce nearly as much volume as the bottom speaker. It's really easy to notice when you hold the phone about a foot from your face, such as when watching video content. It's a little harder to discern if you put the iPhone 7 Plus on a desk or table and take a few steps back.. The quality of music pushed through the speakers is acceptable for low-volume listening, perhaps, but Alcatel did a better job of adding stereo speakers to its $250 Idol 3 smartphone in early 2015.. I am disappointed, especially considering how great the stereo speakers are on Apple's iPad Pro tablets.. A few changes in the spec sheet lead to much better battery life for the iPhone 7 Plus — not that it was lacking in the first place. First, the battery is ever-so-slightly bigger than those of the 6 Plus and 6s Plus. Second, the iPhone 7 Plus has the new A10 processor from Apple with two low-power cores on board to help conserve battery. On what I consider to be a normal day (email, some music, social networking, taking a few photos, watching some video, messaging, and so on) the iPhone 7 Plus easily managed to last from breakfast to bedtime. I had about 40% or more left at the end of each day — and that's with location services on and a Bluetooth device connected the entire time. The iPhone 7 Plus often didn't require charging until it was well into a second day. That's almost as good as it gets with a modern smartphone, especially one so slim.. The iPhone has a low-power mode to help, if you run into trouble. You can also directly manage notifications, screen brightness, and other behaviors.. The iPhone 7 Plus does not officially support rapid charging, nor does it support wireless charging. It will charge more quickly if you plug it into a higher-wattage iPad charger, but the 7 Plus's battery takes much longer to charge than the smaller iPhone 7.. The iPhone 7 Plus has Bluetooth 4.2 aboard and it connects to headphones, speakers, cars, and PCs no problem. Phone calls routed to my car's hands-free system sounded very good, as did calls sent to a standard Bluetooth headset. I tested music on a variety of speakers and headphones and can only say that the iPhone 7 Plus produces average-quality music via Bluetooth. I've heard worse and I've heard better. Apple uses its own, proprietary Bluetooth audio codec instead of the more-common aptX codec for wireless music. (Apple's AirPods aren't available yet, so I can't speak to their quality.). I'm pleased with the accuracy of the GPS radio, which worked well with both Apple Maps and Google Maps. The iPhone 7 Plus pinpointed me quickly and to within 20 feet or so. The device was a fine point-to-point navigation tool and offered accurate directions from A to B. I wish Apple Maps were better at public transportation, but it still covers the basics.. The iPhone has NFC, but it's locked down. The short-range wireless chip is only available to Apple's own Apple Pay service and for pairing with Apple's own AirPod headphones. You can't use the NFC radio to pair with any other Bluetooth accessory.. The iPhone 7 Plus's WiFi radio works fantastically well.. Review: Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar. Belkin's ridiculously-named dongle does one thing: it lets you simultaneously charge your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus and listen to music. If you want to rock out and power up at the same time, Belkin's Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar makes it possible.. Review: Otterbox Universe Case System for iPhone 7. Otterbox has expanded its Universe Case system to the Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, as well as added to its roster of swappable modules. The system includes a rugged case to protect the iPhone day in and day out, and optional accessories, such as a tripod, Flash drive, Bluetooth speakers, multi-tool, and much more.. RhinoShield has some inexpensive Apple iPhone cases for sale that claim to offer big protection with a minimal footprint. The Playproof case and Crashguard bumper do keep your phone safe, but perhaps not as safe as you might wish.. Unlocked smartphones let you use your device on the carrier of your choice, whether at home or travelling overseas. Though unlocked phones tend to be pricey, you can't really put a price on the freedom they offer.. Review: IK Multimedia iRig Mic HD and iRig Mic Field. Whether you're a podcaster, musician, or budding filmmaker, capturing high-quality audio is key when creating content. IK Multimedia's iRig Mic HD and iRig Mic Field give you mono and stereo options, respectively, in compact and easy-to-use accessories for your iPhone.. 3 GB RAM 2,900 mAh battery. Short note: the speakers on the phone work well but the voice quality is not as sharp and clear as the 6 series. It's close but not quite as good. Face time is also a little less clear. The person we were talking to said it didn't sound as good as the 6, side by side. Audio in the earpiece also did not sound quite as good. Is it good enough? Still working on that one..

Battery life is a solid day and maybe a bit more. Warranty information, software updates, and customer service. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. may have gotten a new color ( meet iPhone RED ), but there’s a new model on the way, called iPhone X , that promises to wow. Is the 7 Plus still the iPhone to buy, and how does it stack up against the Android competition? We’ve updated our Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Apple has done it again with the iPhone 7 Plus, a phone that’s as powerful as it is controversial. In camera tests it wows with 2× optical zoom and sharp photos, and it’s finally water resistant; but there’s just one little problem: it doesn’t have a headphone jack.. We’ve been using the iPhone 7 Plus since its release, judging its ongoing performance, and debating whether a missing headphone jack is a deal breaker.. Rumors that Apple was going to ax the 3.5mm headphone jack rocked the internet and inspired a flurry of rage, tears, and fears among the Apple faithful. Rumors turned to fact, so have we. to live with it? First, what does not having a headphone jack mean to you: You have to rely on a Lightning converter for your current corded headphones, or upgrade to a pair of Bluetooth earbuds. To make up for the missing headphone jack, Apple includes a pair of Lightning-connected (wired) EarPods in the box, as well as a Lightning converter — a short cable, horribly known as a dongle — for your 3.5mm headphone plug. The downside: You cannot charge your phone. and listen to music at the same time.. So just how bad is life without a headphone jack? It depends. If you, like many iPhone users, only use the earbuds Apple always includes in the box with your iPhone, you probably won’t care. a pair of earbuds just like last year’s, but they connect to your phone’s Lightning port instead of a headphone jack. The only time a problem arises. is when you want to charge your phone and listen to music simultaneously. — because now you can’t do that without a gross-looking dongle. If you already use wireless headphones, you won’t even notice the headphone jack is gone. For many, however, the omission is still noticeable,. a point we’ll touch upon throughout our Apple iPhone 7 Plus review.. If you have a beloved pair of wired headphones, however, prepare to be seriously annoyed. by the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Sure, you can use the included 3.5mm to Lightning adapter, but dongles aren’t exactly high-class. easily lose it, and the wire connection between the 3.5mm port and the Lightning connector feels flimsy. Much like the included iPhone charging cords, which always break after a year or two, we initially suspected this adapter may not have the longest life.. ours is still intact after daily use, and operates as it did when new. has spent its life plugged into the same pair of earbuds, like a little extension cord, which has minimized the changes of it being lost. impact the sound quality in any obvious way.. The iPhone 7 Plus is the most powerful and technically impressive iPhone yet.. The wired earbuds that come with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sound reasonably good for included headphones, but they’re not discernibly better than the typical 3.5mm earbuds that have shipped with iPhones past. Of our two sets of EarPods, one stopped working properly after a day, forcing us to repeatedly plug them in and jiggle them to try and get them to work. They broke for us on day two, leaving us to rely on an alternative pair of headphones when putting together our Apple. Apple had to improve wireless audio — the result is the W1 wireless chip. It’s implemented in another new Apple product, the AirPods, which are completely wireless and get 5 hours of battery life. They aren’t included in the box, and you can read more about the $160 wireless earbuds here. We tried a pair on and they are exactly like EarPods, just sillier looking without the cord. You can also use any normal wireless headphones with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus — check out our favorites here .. The other bright spot on the audio front is how. the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have stereo speakers — both at the top and bottom of the devices for “increased dynamic range.” The speakers do sound better and louder on the iPhone 7 Plus, though they aren’t as powerful as the front-facing speakers on the ZTE Axon 7 .. The iPhone 7 Plus doesn’t look all that different from last year’s. iPhone 6S Plus — you’ll have to wait for next year’s iPhone 7S/8 for major changes, and rumors are already plentiful .. Although the aluminum uni-body design is nearly identical to last year’s iPhone, that’s not to say it isn’t beautiful. The metal is soft and smooth, and the Apple logo shines out of the center back of the phone. The antenna lines now curve around the corners instead of slashing across the back of the phone, resulting in a cleaner, more minimalist appearance. The dual-camera module sadly sticks out on the back.. Apple introduced two new color options at launch,. black and jet black, and then a special edition Product:RED later on. features a “pristine, mirror-like surface” and a. high-gloss, which is sadly prone to scratches. It also picks up fingerprints like nobody’s business. It looks so pretty until you touch it; then it’s covered in oily smears. The regular black model is the solution, and it gets considerably less smudgy. Apple still offers silver, gold, and rose gold for traditionalists who don’t want the new black and red models.. Unfortunately, the iPhone 7 Plus is still gigantic. This has been emphasized by bezel-less phones like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the LG G6. They both have larger screens than the iPhone, yet housed in considerably more compact bodies. The bezels at the top and bottom of the iPhone are overlarge, and slimming them down would make the phone far more manageable. The iPhone 7 Plus’ footprint could be much smaller, which would appeal to more users and be more comfortable to hold.. It’s not that the iPhone 7 Plus is uncomfortably large, but it’s definitely a device you want to hold with two hands after a while. the Plus is the model we recommend over the smaller iPhone 7, and unless you have very small hands, it’s still perfectly manageable.. The biggest cosmetic difference (besides the removal of the headphone jack) is that both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are (finally!) water- and dust-resistant with an IP67 rating. That means you’ll be able to take either of them under up to 1 meter of water for about 30 minutes. The water resistance level isn’t as high as it is on the Galaxy S8 , which supports IP68 water and dust resistance. The difference is you can submerge the Galaxy S8 in 5 meters of water versus 1 meter with the iPhone 7. But unless you literally swim with your phone, it’s really not a huge deal.. our Apple iPhone 7 Plus review, we dunked both iPhones in a beer stein full of water to see if they’d pass the test, and they did with flying colors. Both were fully operational after several submersion tests. We even played music on the iPhone 7 Plus while it was underwater in the glass, and it pumped out sound like normal.. Apple placed a “Taptic Engine” inside the phone where the headphone jack used to be, a chip that provides haptic feedback when you press the Home button. because now the button isn’t something you can press — it’s a flat, solid surface. Push on it to unlock your phone, and double-tap it to trigger Apple Pay when the screen is off. When you press against it, it provides the same physical feedback you feel when you use 3D Touch on an app icon: a small vibration, and that’s it. Some people will miss the physical button, but it doesn’t bother us at all. In fact, we actually like not having to physically press a button.. The iPhone 7 Plus is an evolutionary step upward for Apple. No revolutionary changes here, but that’s not really a bad thing. The iPhone 7 Plus is nonetheless the most powerful and technically impressive iPhone yet.. 5.5-inch screen with a resolution of 1,920 × 1,080 pixels, the screen is 25 percent brighter than the panel in the 6S Plus and it offers a wider color gamut. It’s not as high-resolution as most Android phones, many of which sport 2,560 × 1,440 pixel resolutions, but the iPhone 7 Plus has one of the sharpest, brightest, and most natural-looking screens you’ll find anywhere. The 1080p resolution doesn’t drain the battery as much, either.. Apple’s new A10 Fusion chip powers the iPhone 7 Plus. It’s a 64-bit, quad-core processor that’s 40 percent faster than the A9 in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. Apple says it’s 120 times faster than the original iPhone. Although that’s hard to prove, we did notice that iOS 10 runs smoother on the iPhone 7 and Plus than it does on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. Will you notice, though? That’s hard to say. Of the four cores, two are for high-performance actions and the remaining two focus on boosting efficiency. Apple has designed a performance controller to determine which actions make use of which. For example, checking your email will most likely be powered by the high-efficiency cores, which are better for saving battery life. The processor also improves the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus’s graphics — it’s 50 percent faster than the A9.. Overall, we’re impressed with the iPhone’s performance. Apple’s iOS 10 runs like a dream, and continues to do so after six months. Several updates have arrived since launch, and the latest version is iOS 10.3.2. It remains solid, stable, reliable, and very fast. deeply incorporates 3D Touch into the interface. The new features include interactive notifications, new widgets, fun tricks in iMessage, and much more. You can read all our thoughts on iOS 10 here. The latest update to Apple’s operating system — iOS 11. — will be available at the end of June. Apple iPhone 7 Plus Compared To. The dual-camera technology on the iPhone 7 Plus is its killer feature. Those two 12-megapixel sensors are the reason why you should buy this phone.. There are two lenses: a 12-megapixel sensor with optical image stabilization, a 28mm wide-angle lens, and an. f/1.8 aperture; and a 12-megapixel sensor with a 56mm-telephoto lens and an f/2.8 aperture. The sensors are 60 percent faster than before and 30 percent more energy efficient, according to Apple. However, what’s cool about these cameras is what they can do. The telephoto lens offered the best optical and digital zoom we had ever seen on a smartphone, but has since been matched by the ability of the Huawei P10 and Mate 9’s zoom lens.. The iPhone 7 Plus can capture detail without losing any noticeable quality with 2× optical zoom. When you take a picture, a 1× icon pops up on screen. Tap it to bring the zoom up to 2× or drag this slider from 1× to 10× and zoom into spectacularly detailed images for a better crop. The camera uses a 2× optical zoom, but it switches to digital zoom when you move past it and on to 10×. The physical 2× zoom looks great and produces sharp closeups that far surpass what you’d get on the standard iPhone 7 or iPhone 6S.. Once you get to the digital zoom, however, things start to get less crisp. Digital zoom is good up to 5×; after that it starts to get blurry, smudgy, and pixelated. Digital zoom also has a harder time in low light, so stick to 2× if the lighting isn’t so hot. This is no different to any other digital zoom system on a smartphone camera, and not unique to the iPhone 7 Plus.. If you’ve never experienced the joy of a zoom lens on a smartphone, then you’re in for a treat. It’s one of the most consistently helpful features on the iPhone 7 Plus, and is great for creativity, and for capturing photos that would usually be impossible.. you will use almost every day, not a gimmick like so many other camera features. How many times have you been to a concert and wished you could get a closeup of the singer onstage? How many times have you been at your kid’s soccer game and wanted to snap a shot from the other end of the field? It happens every day, and the iPhone 7 Plus provides the solution. The dual-camera setup in the iPhone 7 Plus, with its amazing optical zoom, is truly a killer feature.. The dual-camera technology on the iPhone 7 Plus is its killer feature.. The other feature made possible with the two camera lenses is Portrait mode, which adds a. to images taken with the iPhone 7 Plus, giving the background a pleasing and pro-looking blur. Activated in the standard camera app, it requires a little camera re-positioning to activate — you’ll need to be a set distance away from the subject — but the effect is impressive. Because it’s software driven, it’s not infallible, and sometimes the algorithm will blur out small foreground objects. However, it’s great fun to use, and when you get the composition right, pictures can really pop.. Huawei’s P10 and Mate 9 , along with dual-camera phones from Honor and Xiaomi, all offer similar features. Huawei’s P10 is arguably the superior phone for those looking for this feature, as it also incorporates the same mode on the selfie cam.. Other camera improvements include a new. image signal processor that offers twice the throughput of Apple’s previous. processor, a better flash with four LEDs that offer 50 percent more light, and a new flicker sensor that adds artificial light, for brighter images. The iPhone 7 Plus took solid pictures in low light and at night, but the Google Pixel XL produces sharper pictures with more balanced exposure. It’s a tough call between the two cameras, but the Pixel wins in low light. In the daytime, the two are. Professional photographers will be happy to know that the iPhone 7 finally supports the RAW image format in Adobe’s. Lightroom app, allowing for more control when editing photographs. Apple doesn’t support it natively, though.. Finally, the selfie camera on the iPhone 7 Plus has jumped to 7 megapixels, and also features wide color captures and automatic image stabilization. Selfies certainly do look sharper, and that’s a good thing. Selfies are quickly taking over social media, so it’s essential to have a strong front camera. Since the iPhone 7 Plus debuted, Huawei has taken over the selfie scene with the P10.. Battery life on iPhones has never been the best, but the Plus line always gets better battery life than the smaller iPhone. The iPhone 7 Plus is no exception. It lasts through a solid day’s use without a hitch, and if you’re not a power user, it could easily last you a day and a half. The battery in the iPhone 7 Plus is longer lasting than that in last year’s iPhone, and the difference is noticeable. Apple says it’s about an extra hour of battery life, and so far, that’s what we’ve seen in our testing.. The iPhone 6S Plus has seen a drop in battery life with iOS 10 on our units, but the iPhone 7 Plus doesn’t seem to have the issue. The modest increase in battery size is a good thing; we just wish it were greater! We really wouldn’t mind if the phone was thicker if it meant a larger battery inside.. Sadly, there is still no wireless or quick charging on the iPhone 7 Plus. In terms of cutting-edge battery tech, Apple’s latest iPhone falls well behind most modern Android smartphones, including the super-fast charging OnePlus 3T.. Both wireless and quick charging are undoubtedly useful and cool, but they’re not deal-breakers for most people.. Apple offers a one-year limited warranty that covers flaws in manufacturing and offers 90 days of complementary support.. However, Apple’s warranty says that the coverage doesn’t apply to “batteries or protective coatings that are designed to diminish over time,” unless it’s a manufacturing defect (ie. It also doesn’t cover cosmetic or liquid damage. You can read the full terms here :. You can also pay $100 extra for AppleCare+, which extends your coverage to two years and covers up to two incidents of accidental damage. You’ll pay $30 for screen damage or $100 for any other damage. Apple Care+ also puts you on the fast track to customer service support 24/7 via chat or phone through getsupport.apple.com .. Luckily, if something should go wrong with your iPhone 7 Plus, Apple has the great. If you live near an Apple Store, you can schedule an appointment with the Genius bar and have your device looked at. The technician will let you know what’s wrong and walk you through potential solutions. Apple will often repair your device on the same day you bring it into the store, which isn’t something you can say about any other smartphone maker.. If you don’t live near an Apple Store, you can start a live chat with an Apple rep online.. When it comes to software updates, Apple also has the best reputation of any smartphone maker in the world. As soon as a new version of iOS is available, iPhone users worldwide can download it. That means Apple can patch security holes immediately and protect its users from threats and hacks. iPhone users have access to new features right away.. No Android phone can do this except for a Google Pixel or older Google Nexus phones. As such, millions of Android phones remain vulnerable to serious hacks. Although Android manufacturers are getting better at timely updates , it’s still a real issue.. Apple offers the iPhone 7 Plus in the following colors: Gold, rose gold, silver, black, jet black, and red. Storage starts at 32GB, which is a huge upgrade over the 16GB it used to offer in the base model. It’s an important step forward for the company, but we do wish it were 64GB. Apple is trying to upsell you to the 128GB or 256GB model, and that’s not cool. This is already an expensive phone, so it should come with a solid amount of storage, especially since there’s no MicroSD card slot for expansion.. It’s also odd there’s no unlocked option this year, so you’ll have to select your carrier when you check out. GSM carrier iPhone 7 Plus models like the AT&T and T-Mobile units won’t work on CDMA networks like Verizon’s and Sprint’s, which is consumer hostile — and frankly stupid. What if you want to change carriers and keep a phone that you bought at the Apple Store? It’s the kind of crap other phone makers pull all the time and an odd move for Apple.. The iPhone 7 Plus starts at $770, which is a minor price jump from the iPhone 6S Plus’s initial price of $750, but you do get double the storage. If you’re not sold on the Plus, there’s always the standard iPhone 7, but we really recommend the Plus over the smaller model for the camera features, better battery life, and sharper screen.. Who should upgrade? Anyone with an iPhone 6 or older should consider the iPhone 7 Plus. Those with an iPhone 6S should wait for the iPhone 7S / 8 , which is rumored to offer some pretty big changes. Most people don’t need to upgrade every year anymore. Smartphones are plateauing, so new features take some time to develop.. Want a high-powered phone, timely software updates, great customer service, and privacy? Get an iPhone 7 Plus.. The most powerful, durable, and capable phone Apple has ever made, and simply one of the best smartphones you can buy.. The iPhone 7 Plus reigned supreme on release, but smartphone technology has moved on, and there are Android phones out there giving the Apple device a real challenge. The Google Pixel XL is its prime challenger, with its outstanding camera, gorgeous screen, prompt software updates, and support for Daydream VR. It’s not cheap at $750, but if you’re considering the iPhone 7 Plus, you’re already thinking about spending that much.. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is also a force to be reckoned with, due to its fantastic Infinity screen and sleek design. The camera is its achilles heel, and although it’s excellent, hasn’t evolved to keep up with the competition. The LG G6 shares a similarly stunning, compact design, and also excels in the camera department with its dual-lens, wide-angle camera. Both represent the best the companies have to offer in 2017.. Huawei, already a strong choice for photography fans, stepped up its game again with the P10. Happily, the software has also been improved with the introduction of EMUI 5.1, a far better user interface experience than on previous models. To get the iPhone 7 Plus screen size, the P10 Plus is the one to look at, or the larger $500 Mate 9 , which has a 5.9-inch screen in a body that’s still slightly smaller than the iPhone.. However, if you’re seriously considering an iPhone 7 Plus anytime after June or July 2017, and don’t absolutely need to update your phone right now, it may pay to wait until the next iPhone is announced before making a decision. Apple traditionally launches a new iPhone in September, so it’s not long to wait. If you still want an iPhone 7 Plus, they will still be available, and maybe at a lower price.. Finally, if you’re considering a standard iPhone 7 , we encourage you to try out the bigger size. The standard 7 has nowhere near as good a camera, and its battery life is still worse than the larger size.. The iPhone 7 Plus isn’t a rugged phone, and if you drop it, there’s a very good chance the screen will break. It’s a slippery thing too, and we’d definitely recommend wrapping it up in a stylish case. The addition of water resistance does increase its durability though.. Apple supports its phones with software updates for several years, and pushes them out regularly, with new features, improvements, and more. You won’t have to worry about it suddenly being out of date, even if you buy one a year after it was first released. It’ll happily last you more than. It’s also worth mentioning the strong resale value of an iPhone, so if you decide to sell it used, it often commands the highest secondhand price of any smartphone out there.. The iPhone 7 Plus is the iPhone to buy, and it’s also the smartphone to buy, if you’re not already invested in Android.. Although the iPhone 7 Plus isn’t a huge upgrade over the iPhone 6S Plus, Apple took a few radical steps — some good, some bad. The dual-camera tech and its optical zoom are excellent, for example. iOS 10 is the best version of the operating system yet, and it runs best on an iPhone 7 Plus. Adding water resistance is a smart move too; Samsung and many others were here first, but it’s still a great feature. The larger battery is another strong selling point for the iPhone 7 Plus.. There’s no denying that Apple’s boldest and only innovative move with the iPhone 7 Plus — the removal of the headphone jack — is also the riskiest and most hostile to consumers. Those $200-$900 headphones you bought? They’re useless unless they’re wireless or you use Apple’s adapter. Whether this is a deal breaker. depends on your headphone habits more than anything else. Don’t be put off using the iPhone as an excuse to try a pair of Bluetooth headphones, they’re getting better all the time.. If you’re not bothered by the lack of the jack, the iPhone 7 Plus is the way to go.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

I bought 3 of these in different colors as different family members were getting new phones, and these looked nearly identical to cases I've purchased in the past. The overall case is similar, but has some issues. The case seems like it might be slightly tall. It never quite seems to fit perfectly no matter how I adjusted it. The actual hard plastic part hasn't been cut/smoothed quite right where the mute switch is, quite sharp with a bit of plastic kibble on it. 1- The rubber/silicone portion of the case has a cutout for a headphone jack... which the iPhone 7 Plus doesn't have. The images shown on the listing doesn't show this. 2- The camera doesn't line up at all like how they show for the photo. It's pretty close to the edge of the case and I wouldn't be shocked if some photos end up showing the case a bit.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good Grip & Cheerful Trim. My husband bought this same case (blue trim) for his Moto 4, so when I finally sprang for my first smartphone I already knew the case I wanted. With the textured back and rubberized corners this case gives me the best chance of not dropping the device (so far so good!). I have a small woman's hands as well as stiffness from arthritis, so am thrilled with this product. The lilac trim option sealed the deal.. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Case seems a bit small for the 8 Plus. This case is composed of two parts: the black rubbery inner portion and the colored hard plastic shell that clips over the back and around the sides of the case. The two pieces extend to barely hook over the edge of the screen, providing some protection for the front. My complaint: the case seems just a bit too small for my new 8 Plus. The plastic shell doesn’t seem to securely latch on to the front of the screen, and I fear that it may start popping off, allowing my phone to slip out. Also, the plastic shell is rather slick. “Grippier” sides would make the phone feel more secure overall. Nearly all manufacturers appear to be offering one case to fit both the 7 PLUS and 8 PLUS iPhones, but Apple’s specs indicate the 8 Plus is 2mm larger on all three dimensions. I think that variance is a problem with this case. The case seems well constructed of quality materials, if a bit bulky, and the price is right. The port openings are well placed, including the lightening port opening, which allows easy charging. I need a case right now, so I’ll keep this case for now. But I’ll be looking for a better fit.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars I'm glad I bought the other case because I couldn't have ....

iPhone 7 and 7 Plus: Our take on Apple’s latest and greatest. Jet black version of the iPhone 7, 7 Plus may be available in select cities. Small design changes on a waterproof body. Go big or go home: Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, with its amazing dual cameras, is the one to buy.. iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. are here, and yes, everything you’ve heard is true. There’s no headphone jack, you can dunk the new iPhones in water, and the camera on the iPhone 7 Plus can perform all sorts of magic tricks. Otherwise, the changes are quite subtle, so the phone should feel. We’ve been using the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus since they came out in September. We gave both the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus stellar reviews, which you can read in full below. Here’s everything you need to know, including specs, features, pricing, and availability.. Read our iPhone 7 Plus review. The iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus don’t look all that different from last year’s iPhone 6S and 6S Plus — you’ll have to wait for next year’s iPhone 7S/8 for major changes, and of course,. The biggest cosmetic difference (besides the removal of the headphone jack — hello, elephant in the room!) is that both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are (finally!) water- and dust-resistant, with an IP67 rating. That means you’ll be able to take either of them under up to 1 meter of water for about 30 minutes. The water-resistance level isn’t as high on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus as it is on the Galaxy S7 and most other water-resistant phones, all of which support IP68 water and dust resistance. The difference is that you can submerge the Galaxy S7 in 5 meters of water versus 1 meter with the iPhone 7. Unless you literally swim with your phones, it’s really not a huge deal, but it’s a shame that Apple’s water-resistance rating is lower.. We dunked both new iPhones in a beer stein full of water to see if they’d pass the test, and they did — with flying colors. Both phones were fully operational after several submersion tests. We even played music on the iPhone 7 Plus while it was underwater in the glass, and it pumped out sound like normal. If anything, the speakers sounded better with the amplification of the glass and water.. Speaking of speakers, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus now have two speaker grills on the bottom edge of the phone because the 3.5mm headphone jack is gone. You only have the lightning port now for headphones, or you have to go wireless or use the provided adapter, which comes in the box — more on that later.. Apparently, the headphone jack took up a ton of space, and now that it’s gone, Apple added a taptic engine in its place, which provides haptic feedback when you press the Home button. because now the home button isn’t a physical. button — it’s a flat, solid surface. You “press” it to unlock your phone, double-press it to trigger Apple Pay when the screen is off, and double-press it when the screen is on to trigger multitasking mode. When you press it, it provides the same haptic feedback you feel when you use 3D Touch on an app icon. You feel a small vibration, and that’s it. Some people will miss the physical button, but we don’t miss it at all.. The jet Black model is as fingerprint-prone as any glass-backed Galaxy S7, and that’s a real shame.. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have. the same aluminum body and the only difference is the placement of the antenna lines. Now, they curve around the corners instead of slashing across the back. The new iPhones even share the same respective screen sizes as last year’s iPhones: a 4.7-inch display on the 7, and a 5.5-inch screen for the 7 Plus. resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, and its smaller brother packs 1,334 x 750 pixels. 25 percent brighter than the 6S and display a wide color gamut.. But the differences btween the old and new models are still noticeable, and they’re particularly obvious on the new color options: Black and jet black. Jet black features a “pristine, mirror-like surface” and a. “The high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process,” according to Apple. “Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use. If you are concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iPhone.”. Yes, Apple just recommended you get a case for the jet black iPhone 7 because it’s prone to scratches. It also picks up fingerprints like nobody’s business. The jet black model is as fingerprint-prone as any glass-backed Galaxy S7, and that’s a real shame. It looks so pretty until you touch it, and then it’s covered in oily smears. Personally, I hate fingerprint-covered phones and I much prefer the matte Black finish.. Apple still offers silver, gold, and rose gold for traditionalists who don’t want the new black models.. The camera on the rear still sticks out, but the most. noticeable difference is on the iPhone 7 Plus. features dual-cameras on the rear, similar to smartphones. It’s the first iPhone to ever have such a feature, which is easily identifiable on the back of the device. We’ll go into more detail on the cameras later in this article.. Big-screen Nokia 7 Plus featuring Android One announced at Mobile World…. Small design changes on a waterproof body. Dual cameras are impressive on the iPhone 7 Plus. Add Us To Your Social Channels.
