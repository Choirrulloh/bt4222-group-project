It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Stand-by time: 21.0 days (504 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB Host, USB charging. Other: VoIP, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device.

Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Stand-by time: 21.0 days (504 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better!

I thought 4MB of storage in a phone released in 2009 (referring to Nokia 7100 Supernova) was bad. But 4GB of storage in a phone released in 2017 (referring to this phone, the Micromax Bharat 2 Ultra) is EVEN WORSE!. 2MP camera, 512MB of RAM, 4GB of storage, in an android smartphone released in 2017?! I can understand if this phone was released in 2009 but 2017?! This thing is even worse than the iPhone 4S on iOS 9!.

Mediatek MT6737 chipset, Quad-core 1.3 GHz and 2GB RAM. 8MP primary camera with LED flash. 5MP secondary camera with LED flash. 16GB internal storage + microSD expansion slot up to 64GB maximum. 6,980 Indian Rupee or ~ USD 109 price tag. With Micromax Bharat 5 Plus, it is about its huge 5000 mAh battery. But is that all to this smartphone? Find out more details here.. The last release that resembles slightly what is on show here is the Canvas 2 Q4310 that was released a little over 6 months ago. Let’s do a quick throwback of this device:. Canvas 2 Q4310 doesn’t do much justification for its price, especially with its small 5-inch screen, average hardware and limited storage. Even the plus points such as good protection in the form of Gorilla Glass 5, decent camera setup, good battery and the latest operating system doesn’t help much regarding covering up its flaws.. Without further ado, let’s take a closer look at the Bharat 5 Plus:. Guess the advertising is correct, as there’s nothing much going on with the Bharat 5 Plus other than having a huge 5000 mAh battery.. With a standby time of 21 days, this is very useful if you are out and about without any electricity. Even then, it charges other devices for fun which is what a good companion should be all about.. Regarding screen, the Bharat 5 Plus sports a decent 5.2-inch HD screen. But there’s nothing worthy about its hardware though, as it is as entry-level as it can be.. the camera department, it is good to know that the 5MP selfie camera does come with an LED flash.. Then there’s the 8MP primary camera also with a LED flash.. With little 16GB internal storage available, there will be lots of limits on the number of apps and storage that you can install on the Bharat 5 Plus. Thankfully, there’s the expansion slot for an additional 64GB of space.. Micromax Bharat 5 Plus is cheap with the USD 109 price tag. But even when it is this cheap, there’s nothing much that will wow you about this smartphone. Let down by its mediocre hardware and storage limitation; it makes things up slightly with the 5MP selfie camera with LED flash and a huge 5000 mAh battery setup.. Micromax Bharat 5 Plus is currently available for 6,890 Indian Rupee or ~ USD 109 and is available in Black colour only..
