Roydon Cerejo , 20 March 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Z11 mini S features a 13-megapixel front camera with PDAF. The phone delivers good all-round performance. The Nubia Z11 mini S is priced at Rs.16,999. Nubia Z11 mini S design and build Nubia Z11 mini S specifications and features Nubia Z11 mini S performance. Nubia is probably not a brand that features prominently on most people’s lists when they're looking for a new smartphone. like what Honor is to Huawei. the company has been slowly expanding its portfolio of products in India.. Nubia's latest entry is the Z11 mini S, which was announced in China back in October. Launching in India exclusively with Amazon, the Z11 mini S will go head-to-head. ( Review ), with similar pricing and specifications for the top-end variant. Taking on an established brand is no easy feat, but if Nubia has done its homework right, the Z11 mini S could be a good alternative for those willing to go against the crowd.. The metal unibody looks great and is even better to grip. Despite a thickness of just 7.6mm, the sides offer enough surface area to hold the phone comfortably without the fear of it slipping. The matte finish of the rear also helps.. The borders on either side of the display of the Nubia Z11 mini S are fairly slim, letting the screen dominate the front. There are backlit capacitive buttons at the bottom for navigation, of which. the home button has a “breath. which indicates when the phone is charging. It pulsates for unread SMSes but didn’t seem to work with other messaging apps.. The 5.2-inch full-HD display on the Nubia Z11 mini S. gets Gorilla Glass protection and a good brightness level of 450nit. We didn’t have any trouble using the phone under direct sunlight, and touch response was pretty spot on too. You can play around with the colour temperature in the Settings app if needed. The compact size of the phone makes one-handed use somewhat possible.. On the left side of the Nubia Z11 mini S, you have a hybrid dual-SIM slot that can accept microSD cards of up to 200GB. There are buttons on the right, a headphones socket up top, and a USB Type-C port on the bottom. Everything is ergonomically placed, with good tactile feedback from the buttons. There’s a minor bump on the back for the camera lens, but you shouldn’t worry about scratches as Nubia has used a sapphire glass lens. The fingerprint sensor on the Nubia Z11 mini S. works well and it can be used to take a photo or lock. an app, in addition to just unlocking the phone.. In the box, you get a 7.5W charger, a Type-C cable, a SIM ejector tool,. There isn’t a bundled headset but the quality of the rest of the accessories is good. Overall, we’re pretty happy with what Nubia has done with the construction and aesthetics of the Z11 mini S. It’s light, good looking and built well.. In India, Nubia is launching only one variant of this phone, the one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Processing is handled by the proven octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC, which has found its way into many good phones including the Redmi Note 4. ( Review ), Moto Z Play. ( Review ), and Vivo V5 Plus. Performance is generally good, and we recorded an AnTuTu score of 63,074 and 22fps in GFXbench.. The Z11 mini S supports 4G on both SIMs, as well as VoLTE, Bluetooth 4.1, dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac, USB-OTG, FM radio, and a suite of sensors including a gyroscope. NFC is one feature that’s missing.. The phone runs Nubia UI 4.0, which is a custom fork of Android Marshmallow 6.0.1. According to Nubia, it will take time to roll out a Nougat update. Like most custom Android forks from Chinese brands, the layout takes a bit of getting used to, and text needs to be cleaned up in some places. There are some interface customisations like ‘Edge Gestures’ and ‘Screen Split-up’. The former lets you view the homescreen, switch between apps, close background apps and adjust the brightness by. your fingers in different ways along the edges of the display. Screen Split-up lets you divide your homescreen and use two different apps at the same time.. Both features work well but we didn’t end up using them much during the course of our review, as they feel a bit gimmicky. The ‘Features’ sub-menu of the Settings app lets you customise the functions. of the capacitive keys as well as gestures. There are built-in scrolling screenshot and screen recording tools. The phone ships with few preinstalled apps like News Republic and Kika Keyboard. Nubia also bundles a User Manual app for novice users.. After a little over a week’s worth of usage, we don’t have much to complain about when it comes to general performance of the Nubia Z11 mini S. Apps are quick to load, and this phone multitasks well. Heavy games like Asphalt 8 and Implosion run without any noticeable lag. The back of the phone got warm while gaming, but other than this, we didn’t face any overheating issues.. Audio performance is good with headphones, as the phone supports DTS with the ability to tweak the bass and treble. The Z11 mini S supports the FLAC and AC3 codec. DTS works systemwide, just as long as you use headphones. The mono speaker isn’t the clearest for media but it works for alerts.. Nubia is promoting this phone's rear camera as one of its biggest highlights. Here, we have a 23-megapixel Sony IMX318 sensor with PDAF and an f/2.0 aperture. We were quite impressed with the level of detail. and colours the sensor manages to capture in daylight. Details in distant objects could have been sharper but the quality is still better than most phones in this price range can produce. Focusing is quick and that isn't affected much in low light. Speaking of which, low-light performance isn’t too bad either, with very little noise ruining shots, although details tend. Tap to see full-sized Nubia Z11 mini S camera samples. The Z11 mini S offers shooting modes including slow shutter, panorama, and manual, plus some fun effects like multi-exposure and time-lapse to play around with. You can also shoot in RAW. We didn’t find the HDR function to be very effective, the colours in HDR images looked a bit off. Video recording maxes out at 4K, but you also get a slow-motion mode. The 13-megapixel front camera on the Nubia Z11 mini S. also boasts of PDAF and an f/2.0 aperture, which gives selfies. There’s a beautify feature and a screen flash, which is too weak to have any real effect. Video recording maxes out at 1080p with the front camera.. The Z11 mini S packs in a 3000mAh battery. It ran for 13 hours and 3 minutes in our HD video loop test, which is pretty good. We were able to go an entire day on a single charge with moderate usage. Sadly, there’s no fast charging, and we were only able to get up to 36 percent in an hour, which isn’t too good.. Verdict The Z11 mini S has all the makings of a good smartphone, and after spending little more than a week with it, most of these translate well in the real world. Nubia has done a great job in terms of build quality and aesthetics, and this phone is well equipped with plenty of storage and a good processor. Both cameras do a good job in most lighting conditions, and battery life is solid too. There are areas where this phone could have been better, such as faster charging,. the inclusion of NFC, and a more polished Android skin.. The Z11 mini S is available exclusively on Amazon at Rs. 16,999, which makes it worth considering if you’re looking for good cameras.. The Moto G5 Plus is one of the obvious choices at this price but as an alternative, the Z11 mini S is right up there along with the Lenovo Z2 Plus. ( Review ) as a solid alternative, in addition to the a slightly more affordable Xiaomi Redmi Note 4.

ZTE Nubia Z11 mini S bears stellar cameras, decent overall specs for $222 and up. Adrian Diaconescu October 17, 2016 11:21 am. With a 5-inch Snapdragon 617 “mini” model packing just 3GB RAM, 5.5-inch SD820 standard configuration capping off at 6 gigs of the good stuff, and 6-inch Max featuring a 652 processor and 4GB memory , the ZTE Nubia Z11 family already felt pretty complete.. If anything, an ultra-high-end variant was missing, SD821 power, Quad HD screen resolution and all. But instead of rolling out such an unapologetic beast, ZTE has earlier today taken the wraps off another relatively affordable Z11 derivation with a mix of mid-range and super-premium specs.. The confusingly named Nubia Z11 mini S is slightly larger than the Z11 mini, but of course smaller than the Z11, at 5.2 inches, sporting the same 1,920 x 1,080 pixels display, touting a mediocre (by flagship standards) Snapdragon 625 SoC, plentiful 4GB RAM count, and fittingly generous 64/128GB internal storage options, expandable via microSD.. The 23 and 13MP cameras, vastly upgraded from the Z11 mini’s 16 and 8MP shooters, are arguably the key selling point here, alongside a winning aircraft-grade aluminum construction, minimal bezels, blazing fast fingerprint recognition, and more than respectable 3,000 mAh battery.. Available in a nifty combination of gold and black, as well as plain gold and silver, the ZTE Nubia Z11 mini S starts at the equivalent of $222 (Yuan 1,500) on Chinese shores. Any chance of a Western expansion? Probably not, but be happy you’re at least getting a stab at the Axon 7 Mini .. Source: MyDrivers Via: SlashGear.

Nubia has done a great job in terms of build quality and aesthetics, and this phone is well equipped with plenty of storage and a good processor. Both cameras do a good job in most lighting conditions, and battery life is solid too.

It features the perfect hardware combination and I have no complaints regarding its Rs 16,999 price tag because it offers a lot more than the competition. Thereâs a capable 23MP camera, great battery life and a premium looking design, one that even gives the Asus Zenfone 3 (5.2-inch model) a run for its money.

Join Date: Joined: Oct 2009. My first visit here, hope someone can help. I received my Nubia 11 last week and have been setting it up. I noticed I only receive my whatsapp messages when I am actually using the phone and the app is running in the background, leave the phone for a few minutes and if someone has whatsapped me in that time I will not receive the notification unless I take the phone out of 'sleep' and check whatsapp at which point any messages will come in. I thought it was just whatsapp but then realized its any messaging emails (gmail and outlook) app. I have scoured the settings, permissions, etc but cant seem to find anything that will stop my apps going to sleep/stopping when the phone goes to sleep. Receiving any emails/messages does not wake the phone up to notify me. Join Date: Joined: Sep 2011. My Devices: Xiaomi Mi 4. if you have the EU version of ROM you have to open task manager(long press on back softkey and swipe down on whatsapp and other app that you want to "lock" in memory. your notification will work even in sleep..

With 4GB RAM and a 23MP camera, the ZTE Nubia Z11 Mini S offers big value. ZTE made a name for itself in the U.S. with its Axon line of phones, but the company. is already well-established in the eastern part of the world, thanks to its Nubia line.. Enter the awkwardly named Nubia Z11 Mini S, which. was announced during a recent launch event, reports SlashGear .. Starting on the outside, the antenna bands on the top and bottom are similarly designed to those on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, but the unibody aircraft-grade aluminum construction. helps to exude a sense of quality. Similar to other Android phones, the Nubia Z11 Mini S features a fingerprint sensor on the back that ZTE claims only takes 0.1 seconds to wake it up.. Above the 5.2-inch, 1,920 × 1,080 resolution display sits a 13-megapixel camera,. but ZTE touts the 23MP camera with f/2.0 aperture on the back. The rear camera is Sony’s IMX318 CMOS sensor, the same sensor found in the Xperia X. Low-light shots taken by Sony’s phone were not. impressive, but the camera held its own in most conditions, so the same could probably be said of the Nubia Z11 Mini S’ camera.. Under the hood, an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset and 4GB RAM power the phone, with either 64GB. or 128GB of internal storage available for use. If neither storage option is enough for your needs, there is a MicroSD card slot for even more memory.. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh battery, which ZTE promises will. let you use the Nubia Z11 Mini S for three and a half days before needing to plug it in. This is due to what the company calls NeoPower 2.0, a proprietary technology that optimizes different components inside of the phone in order to maximize battery life. Whether folks will actually be able to use the Nubia Z11 Mini S for that long remains to be seen, though the technology. is also in use in the larger Nubia Z11 Max.. Unfortunately, ZTE’s Nubia phones have a hard time leaving mainland China, and the Nubia Z11 Mini S is no exception. You can certainly import it, if you. want to go down that route, though odds are you will fork over more than the 1,500 yuan ($222) asking price.. Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra, XA2, and L2 hands-on review.

ZTE has been slowly and repeatedly trying to penetrate the Indian market amongst the Chinese competition that somehow, always seems to get the upper hand. Last year I reviewed the ZTE Nubia Z11 Mini. It was a well-designed smartphone that packed in Android 5.0 Lollipop, and average. The Nubia Z11 Mini was priced at Rs 12,999, which basically meant that it was built to compete with the Redmi Note 3. Despite its well-designed exterior, it were. the internals that were a let-down.. But now it’s a new year with a new Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 out, and ZTE had to come up with an answer.. Behold, the ZTE Z11 Mini S! It’s ZTE’s answer to the new Redmi Note 4, and it comes with a ton of hardware improvements over the old model, including a 23MP camera and a battery-happy Snapdragon 625 chipset. But with a price tag of Rs 16,999, is it worth it?. The ZTE Nubia Z11 Mini S has a pretty long name, for what appears to be a good-looking smartphone that can be operated using one hand.. The design is nothing new, but the construction offers something different for those who are looking to upgrade from a Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 , a Moto G4/G4 Plus or a Vivo V5. This is because ZTE gives you a well-finished metal body that could easily be mistaken for a premium smartphone.. Starting from the front, there is nothing exciting out here apart from the 2.5D curved class. It looks like a slab of black glass with the usual red Nubia breathing light at the bottom end.. However, things get interesting when you flip the smartphone over.. At Rs 16,999 it is really impressive what ZTE has pulled off here. There’s no plastic used anywhere in the construction, just metal and glass. The back is rounded and bulges towards the centre, a surface that appears to been flattened. But even with flattened back, the phone keeps spinning around when placed on a table and will wobble a bit every time you tap on the display.. The sides are well-rounded and polished, meaning that there are no rough edges anywhere, just a smooth and seamless metal back.. At the top and bottom of the rear are the plastic inserts in the antenna gaps, which look a lot like those on the iPhone 7. Also sitting at the back is a fingerprint reader.. I liked the red detailing of the camera ring and also how the camera lens and the flash unit are protected by their individual metal rings.. The Z11 mini S indeed packs in everything you can think of and more when you consider its price tag.. While it may seem a bit less when compared to a Redmi Note 4, it does make up for it in other areas.. There’s a 5.2-inch Full HD IPS LCD display on the front, along with the usual array of sensors and a 13MP front camera that sits to the left of the receiver. Inside, you get a tried and tested Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset clocked at 2.0GHz with an Adreno 506 GPU. The chipset is paired with 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 256GB using the second SIM slot.. On the back, the primary camera features of a 23MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and an LED flash, which is the second highlight of this smartphone.. You get the usual connectivity options, which include, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth v4.1, GPS and FM Radio and even NFC. There’s even a USB Type-C port at the bottom that keeps up with the times.. Powering all of the above is 3,000mAh battery, which is a tiny improvement over the 2,800mAh unit on its predecessor.. The 5.2-inch display on the Z11 Mini S is a fine-looking unit. It does not go over the top with colour saturation and features some decent looking blacks keeping its price tag in mind. With a Full HD resolution, its 424ppi pixel density ensures that text looks crisp, even if it is set at smallest setting. The same can be said about the images, which made viewing videos a great experience.. The screen over the display feels solid and looks great with 2.5D finish around the corners, something that adds to the premium look and finish of this mid-range smartphone. The screen does accumulate fingerprints easily, but thanks to its oleophobic coating can be wiped off with minimal effort.. Coming to the negatives, the display despite being an IPS LCD unit does look noticeably dull when viewed at an angle. Adding to what appears to be insufficient levels of brightness, is a noticeable pink tinge.. The software that governs the ambient light sensor seems a bit too aggressive and will rarely crank up the brightness even in brighter environments. I ended up keeping the Auto Brightness feature turned off most of the time.. The software along with Nubia UI 4.0 does have its advantages. Head on to Settings and under Display you will also find a Screen display preferences section that lets you customise the displays, hue and saturation levels, which is a good touch.. The ZTE Nubia Z11 Mini S features a customised version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow called Nubia UI. This is Nubia UI 4.0 and while it comes with some interesting customisation and gesture functions, is quite a mess considering its. Indeed, I have seen better customised mobile operating systems (or skins) from Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo but there’s literally nothing like what you get on a ZTE.. First let’s begin with the positives. The software feels light and does not appear to bog. down the hardware that already consists of low-powered Cortex-A53 cores. In fact, there are so many of them, that they end up hampering the user experience. The side edge gestures were my favourite. And each of them can be customised to an extent.. You can how hold down the edge, to quickly break down into card view and select the desktop of your choice. You can even swipe up or down the edge of the screen to switch between apps (pretty handy). You can swipe down both edges of the display to adjust the brightness and there are still a few more.. While they did make for a fun way to use the smartphone, with so many gestures turned on, I did end up with the touch sensitivity of the corners and edges of the display being turned off during normal app usage. This led to issues when you tap on the corner of the keyboard to switch the numeric keys, where half the button gets ignored thanks to the overlay of the touch gesture, that takes 4-5mm off your touch area from the corners.. There is a split screen mode available for a limited number of apps. But I'd rather not mention it as its implementation is pretty bad.. Eventually, it went from fun to annoying and I ended up turning every single software gesture off.. Then there’s the inconsistency in the UI. Everything from the text, to the buttons to the layout of the buttons to the layout of the text, is a complete mess.. Thanks to this severe lack of optimisation, you will find text for many menus and headers in native apps scrolling through because they don’t fit inside the UI button or tab.. There is a major issue with aligning buttons and wrapping text to fit into menus.. While typing and copy pasting text, I often found myself waiting for the text to stop rolling so I could figure out which one was copy, paste and cut. ZTE could have simply gone in for stock Android and solved the problem entirely, but then again it seems to favour its swipe-happy Nubia UI over Spartan stock Android Marshmallow.. was even visible in the notifications tray where I often ended up with lines of text that got cut into half thanks to the additional notification from the same app below it. Indeed there is a lot to work on out here.. Similar to Xiaomi, Lenovo, Asus and Vivo, ZTE goes in for the same chipset that is both capable and delivers great battery life. There are no slowdowns while using the smartphone and games and apps open and close quickly, without lag. In fact, at a point it gets hard to tell that there is a battery-friendly chipset inside, thanks to the well-optimised software. Gaming is not a problem either and most of the current favourites run without problems, provided the graphics settings are set to medium. With just A53 low-power cores inside, there are no heating problems either.. Call quality was fine and the caller on the other side could be heard loud and clear. The same can be said about audio quality while listening to music though the headphones. What I did find annoying was the low speaker output. The volume levels were almost half of what the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 offered. This is disappointing since the phone comes across as a premium device, at a price tag that is a higher than the rest of the competition.. For a smartphone that comes with budget processing chops, I assumed that the high resolution 23MP camera at the rear was a gimmick. To begin with, the software interface of the camera is brilliant. There are a ton of photo modes available under Camera Family and most of them are worthwhile provided you have tripod handy.. The 'Gradienter' sitting over the shutter button is available in both Auto and Pro modes.. Everything that is available on the camera interface actually works. The handiest one of them all was the ‘Gradienter’ that basically shows a bubble level on the shutter button itself that will help you frame your images perfectly. There is a separate Pro section with the usual manual controls and even your now standard, Beauty mode for selfies.. Click on the Flickr gallery below to check out the image samples of the ZTE Nubia Z11 Mini S. Coming to image quality, the lack of OIS can clearly be felt. But the Sony IMX318 Exmor RS sensor is pretty darn good. The images shot using the primary camera looked impressive for a smartphone in this range. They are not perfect, but showcased balanced and natural looking tones with the right level of sharpness. There is a bit of lens barrel distortion present, but the images showcased enough detail with the noise reduction on, made me forget about it. The camera also has the tendency to over expose at times, but keeping the HDR mode on Auto takes care of this problem.. Focusing thanks to PDAF was really quick (even in low light) and the built in modes that offered a zoomed preview for the Macro mode is well thought of.. Low light is a slightly different scenario. With noise reduction turned on, the images in auto mode, showcased flat. This however varied from scene to scene. At times the noise reduction was useful while at others I had to turn it off (available in More Settings) to get some detail in the image. Switch to the Pro Mode and here is where the noise reduction really shines with long exposures (using a tripod) that are sharp and literally noise free at ISO 400.. The video department also has some good stuff including satisfactory 4K video and 1080p video at 60 fps which was impressive considering this smartphone’s price. The selfie camera produced photographs with good detail at 13MP resolution as you can see in the camera samples gallery above.. All in all, the ZTE Z11 Mini S comes with a great camera module and thanks to its software bits makes the most of it. Enough for me to call it a camera smartphone. Something, that you usually do not find in this price range.. With a Snapdragon 625 inside, paired with a 5.2-inch Full HD display and just a 3,000mAh battery I did not expect the worst. True to my expectations, the smartphone performed really well although not as well as the Asus Zenfone 3S Max , which is the current king of ring in terms of battery life.. PC Mark Battery Life test results.. I got more than a day of use continuous use and 12 hours on PC Mark for Android test,. from this smartphone, which is pretty impressive. Indeed, ZTE has worked on optimising the software which is why I ended up with such great battery life results despite the tightly packed 3,000mAh battery.. The ZTE Nubia Z11 Mini S is a great smartphone, that’s stuck with unfinished software; something that the company can work on and fix. It features the perfect hardware combination and I have no complaints regarding its Rs 16,999 price tag because it offers a lot more than the competition. There’s a capable 23MP camera, great battery life and a premium looking design, one that even gives the Asus Zenfone 3 (5.2-inch model) a run for its money.. With that said, the camera on the Asus Zenfone 3 that is priced at Rs 21,999 is better, but not by large margin.. As for the rest of the competition that falls behind the Mini S, you get the Asus Zenfone 3S Max (Rs 14,999), the Vivo V5 (Rs 17,980) and the Redmi Note 4 , which offers similar hardware at a much lower price tag of Rs 12,999. There's also the recently launched Moto G5 Plus, but our review for now still stands pending. Our first impressions of the G5 Plus are out and you can have a look by clicking here .. What ZTE has with Nubia Z11 Mini S is the right-sized package with a good balance of hardware that justifies its price tag. Go for it if you are coming from any of the budget smartphones mentioned above or are looking for premium design and capable camera in the sub Rs 20,000 range.. #ZTE Nubia z11 Mini S Design. #ZTE Nubia z11 Mini S Display. #ZTE Nubia z11 Mini S Features. #ZTE Nubia z11 Mini S Specifications.

Far from being a mini 2016 smartphone in terms of specifications, the Nubia Z11 Mini S boasts a 23-megapixel 6P-lens f/2.0 primary camera and a 13-megapixel 5P-lens selfie cam, which are powered by a 2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon octa-core engine clubbed with a robust 4GB LPDD3 RAM.. It is loaded with 128GB of internal memory that can be expanded by up to 200GB and it sports a fingerprint scanner right under its rear camera. Up front, it touts a 5.2-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) 2.5D-glass In-Cell IPS screen, with NFC (near Field Communication) and the DTS Audio sound technology joining the mix as well. Its battery power caps off at 3000mAh (We expected something around 4000mAh, given its specs) and it comes in either Black, Gold, or Khaki.. ZTE's Nubia Z11 Mini S packs some heavy artillery imaging-wise, with a 23-megapixel rear cam and a 13-megapixel front cam, but it settles for a Full-HD-1080p (instead of premium Quad-HD-1440p) screen resolution.

ZTE Nubia Z11 Mini S review: This compact camera phone is a delight for photography enthusiast. ZTE Nubia Z11 Mini S review: This compact camera phone is a delight for photography enthusiast. Published: Saturday, April 1, 2017, 15:30 [IST]. Design: It's stylish and one of the most ergonomic handset in its price-segment Display: Vibrant 5.2-inch Full HD screen with 2.5D curved glass Camera: The 23MP rear camera is by far the best in its price-point Performance: Snappy processor and lag-free Multitasking Storage and Connectivity: Ample storage and almost all the required connectivity features Battery: Not the best in its price-point but gets the job done Verdict. ZTE's sub brand Nubia recently announced Z11 Mini S in the Indian market at a price-point of Rs. Packing a capable 23MP rear camera, the smartphone takes on the current budget king Moto G5 Plus and other similarly priced Android handsets selling in Indian online marketplace.. Compact and stylish design | Vibrant Full HD display | Good camera performance | swift computing | multitasking. No Android Nougat, , | Screen’s edge features are gimmicky | No fast charging. The Z11 Mini S is designed to keep up with the pace of the today's smart-phone users, and comes with a familiar processor- the Snapdragon 625, 4GB of RAM, 64GB internal memory and everything else you would expect from a smartphone in today's time.. So does it have what it takes to be the best budget smartphone? Let's find out with the help of this review.. Nubia Z11 Mini S is one of the most compact and ergonomic handset I have used in a while. The smartphone's 5.2-inch screen footprint makes it an easy fit in hands and the right placement of hardware buttons allows you to operate the smartphone with one hand. The rounded corners and the gentle curves at the rear side further adds to the ergonomics.. The hybrid SIM card tray is placed on left that allows you to have two nano SIM cards or one nano SIM card and a microSD card active at a time.. And while the smartphone offers a comfortable fit, it also looks quite stylish. Nubia Z11 Mini S has a metal frame that is made of 6000 series Aluminum Alloy with matte and frosting surfaces, giving it a smooth feel in hand.. Nubia N2, M2 and M2 Lite launched: Price, Specifications and more. You will also find Nubia's personal touches on front and rear such as touch capacitive rounded home-button at front, red circular ring on the camera module at rear, Nubia branding embossed in center and antenna bands shifted to extreme top and bottom to offer a continuous seamless design when seen from the rear side.. Overall, Nubia Z11 Mini S offers an amazing combination of style and comfort in mid-range price segment.. Complementing the design is the 5.2-inch Full HD IPS LCD screen, which is protected by a 2.5D curved Corning Gorilla glass. The display offers a pixel density of 424ppi and brightness of 450 nits. It is fairly bright and colours looks quite vibrant when you stream 1080p videos, play games or browse internet pages. The touch response is good and viewing angles are also decent, making the screen fairly usable in outdoor conditions.. Coming onto the highlight of the Nubia Z11 Mini S, it features a 23MP rear camera that uses a Sony IMX318 Sensor and has a focus time of 0.2 seconds. The rear camera comes with 6P Sapphire lens and works on an aperture size of f/2.0, which is decent to capture sharper details even in uneven light but an aperture of f/1.7 would have done wonders on this handset.. Nevertheless the 23MP rear camera delivers amazing results and makes the Nubia Z11 Mini S the best camera smartphone in its price-segment. The pictures captured in daylight look sharp, have good detailing and colour reproduction seems really good on the 5.2-inch Full HD screen.. What makes Nubia Z11 Mini S a delight for photography enthusiasts, is the variety of modes and filters the camera offers to photography enthusiasts.. You have light painting, multi-exposure, slow shutter, start trail, slow motion, time-lapse, a clone mode, macro, and more. Besides, the filers section offers miniature, old film, fish eye, black and white, etc. that further helps to enhance the images you capture.. I managed to capture some amazing macro and low-light star trail shots with the 23MP rear camera. The camera can also record videos in 4K resolution and PDAF and beauty mode is provided in both front and rear snappers. You can check the camera sample shots below.. Nubia Z11 Mini is a swift performer. The smartphone is backed by the capable Snapdragon 625 CPU, which is a 64-bit octa-core processor built on the 14nm processing technology known for low power consumption. The smartphone performs everyday tasks such as web browsing, calling, camera usage, light gaming, video streaming, etc. Application loading time is quick you can navigate from one screen to another and through the multitasking pane with no performance lags. The Adreno 506 GPU also makes sure you enjoy games with no major performance issues.. The handset can run games like Dead Trigger 2, Spiderman Unlimited, Contact Killer, etc. Besides, the 4GB RAM makes sure you multitask with ease.. Nubia Z11 Mini S runs on Android 6.0.1 with Nubia UI V4.0 on top of it. I am quite pleased by the fact that how visually appealing the user interface is and how smoothly it works in everyday life. The only issue is the 'Edge' features that are not very consistent.. Thee edge features are powered by Nubia FiT 2.0 that creates a new interactive method. You can control the smartphone with touch gestures on the edges of the screen by triggering interactive responses including adjusting brightness, switching between apps in the background, returning to your last used page and clearing apps running in the background. These features in action look quite slick and come handy in day-to-day tasks.. You also get long screenshot, multi-screen view where you can two apps at the same time, screen recording that captures everything you perform on the display and dual-mode that allows you to access two accounts on one phone.. Storage will not be a problem on Nubia Z11 Mini S as the handset comes with 64GB inbuilt memory that can be expanded by up to 200GB via microSD card. For connectivity, you get a hybrid SIM card tray that can accommodate two nano SIM cards, or one nano and one microSD card. Besides, you also have Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi and GPS. The smartphone does not include NFC but supports both TD-LTE and FDD-LTE networks.. Nubia Z11 Mini S is backed by a 3,000 mAh battery unit that can easily last for a day and even more on a single charge depending upon your usage. As the battery has to support a smaller 5.2-inch screen, and it gets the advantage of Snapdragon 625's battery efficiency, you will not be disappointed with the good amount of time it lasts for.. I believe the nubia's patented high power efficiency technology- NeoPower that prevents the unnecessary power consumption and reduces the run time of systems and apps, gets the job done here. What seems missing is the fast charging that you will find in Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and Moto G5 Plus, the competitors of Nubia Z11 Mini S.. The Z11 Mini S combines elegant design with a vibrant full HD display and a capable 23MP rear camera system that offers plenty of features to bring out the photographer in you. The smartphone is very ergonomic to use and delivers on everyday tasks without any performance issues.. It's priced decently for the hardware and features it brings to table and tops our recommendation list for users who are looking for a capable camera smartphone in mid-range price segment. The only problem is the brand trust that Nubia devices fails to offer in the Indian market and will lose the game to Moto G5 Plus and Xiaomi Redmi Note 4.. The smartphone also misses fast charging- a feature that is gradually becoming a standard addition these days. Besides, you have to adjust with Android 6.0 Marshmallow as of now, but that's not a very big problem as the Nubia UI is quite smooth and the handset might also get the Android 7.0 Nougat in the coming months.. If you can adjust with aforementioned things then Nubia Z11 Mini S can be the ideal handset for you in sub Rs. Else you can go with Moto G5 Plus, Honor 6X and Xiaomi Redmi Note 4..
