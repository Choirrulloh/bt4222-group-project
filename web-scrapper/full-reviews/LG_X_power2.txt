Its whopping 4,500mAh battery promises to last two days on a single charge.. by February 23, 2017 5:53 PM PST. LG X Power 2, the midrange phone with the macho name. LG X Power 2 says yes to two-day battery. Hardware specs 5.5-inch screen 4,500mAh nonremovable battery 13-megapixel rear camera; 5-megapixel front-facing camera 2GB or 1.5GB of RAM 16GB of internal storage with the option to expand up to 2TB 1.5 GHz octa-core processor 6.09 by 3.07 by 0.33 inches (154.7 by 78.1 by 8.4mm) 5.78 ounces (164 grams) Android 7.0 Nougat. A full day of battery life is pretty much the holy grail of the smartphone world, where intense use sucks down battery reserves faster than a kid with a juice box. But two days of battery life? That's a pretty rare feat.. LG's X Power 2, a followup to last year's X Power , claims it can go two days on a single charge, driven by a high-capacity battery. It clocks in at 4,500mAh, compared to the X Power's 4,100mAh battery pack. And no, you can't remove it.. LG claims it can play 15 hours of continuous video, and charge up to 50 percent of its battery in an hour. The whole charge should take two hours total. Like most other phones, it uses Quick Charge technology. But what does "two days" mean? A full 48 hours of use or more like 16 to 20? We won't know for sure until we test it ourselves.. LG X Power 2, the midrange phone with the macho name. We did get a chance to see the X Power 2 in person. While it's got mostly midrange specs, the phone was slimmer and lighter than you might expect for a 5.5-inch phone with an enormous battery. It otherwise packs hardware that leans towards the higher end of midrange specs. That includes a 1.5GHz octa-core processor and a 13-megapixel camera. It's certainly not as exciting as LG's other phone of Mobile World Congress , the sleek and premium LG G6 , but it may be a good option for users looking for a long-lasting but affordable device.. There's no official pricing yet, but look for it to cost about the same as the original LG X Power, maybe a little more: about $150 at the low end (there may be a range with different capacities and chips.) In the UK, that may work out to somewhere in the vicinity of £170; that price would convert to AU$275.. The sequel phone will be available in March and launch in Latin America first. Afterward, it will roll out to the US and countries in Asia and Europe, as well as other regions.. Follow along with CNET's complete coverage of Mobile World Congress 2017 ..

LG's new X Power 2 may offer great battery life and an attractive design, but it's limited in storage and doesn't feature a high-resolution screen.. LG X Power 2 price and release date. LG X Power2 spec and features. LG X Power2 camera Early verdict. LG's new flagship phone, the LG G6 , has impressed us – but it’s almost certain that it won’t last two whole days on a single charge.. So, for those for whom battery life is a deal-breaker, LG has also launced the X Power2, a mid-range phone that should last you a whole weekend on a full charge.. The X Power2 was launched just in time for MWC 2017 , and we’ve had some time to try out the phone briefly at the show.. The LG X Power2 is expected to go on sale in Latin America in March, with a rollout across the US and Europe to follow – so expect it to be April or later before you can get your hands on this phone. There’s no word yet if it'll be launching in Australia.. As for the price, LG has yet to reveal that. The original X Power launched in the US at $199 (about £160, AU$260), so we’d expect it to be a similar price level to that phone.. The X Power2 isn’t a premium-feeling phone. It does have an attractive design, but the build quality isn't that impressive – it feels like you can pull the back panel off, but you can't.. There’s an interesting metal effect on the back of the phone which makes it feel strange to the touch, but it dazzles when you hold it up in the light.. But it all feels a little tacky on the back when we're used to seeing full metal uni-body phones, even at this price point.. You’ll be able to buy the X Power2 in four colors: black, silver, gold and a dark blue.. On the front of the phone is a 5.5-inch display, but it’s not Full HD, as we’d hope for on a phone at this price point now.. Instead it’s 720p, and you can really tell that LG hasn’t opted for a high resolution on this screen.. If you plan to watch a lot of video and play games on your new phone, this may not be a great choice, with a lower resolution than most phones this year.. That said, the lower resolution may mean the claims about battery life that LG is making are borne out.. The battery pack inside the LG X Power2 is the key highlight here – it’s a 4,500mAh cell that LG claims will last for a whole weekend.. Whether this will actually prove to be the case is unclear, but Lenovo managed to do it with the Lenovo P2 , with that phone lasting for a whole two days on its 5,100mAh cell.. Android 7 Nougat software is on board here, and it’s a clean UI, which means you’ll get the latest features wrapped in an attractive design.. Under the hood is a MediaTek MT6750, which is an SoC (system on a chip) we haven’t used in another phone yet, so it's hard to judge how powerful it’ll be.. That’s paired with either 1.5GB or 2GB of RAM (depending on what market you're in), which should keep you going when playing modern games and using a variety of high-end apps.. Storage-wise there’s only 16GB on board, which may cause some issues if you want to keep a lot of media on your phone. MicroSD support is present, but you may not want to spend the extra on a large enough memory card to make use of it.. There’s a respectable 13MP rear shooter on the X Power2, and during our limited testing of the device we got some okay shots that won’t blow anyone away, but which also didn’t look awful.. In bright lighting the phone looked like it could compete with the likes of the Lenovo P2 or the Moto G4 , but we’ll put the camera through its paces properly for our full review later in the year.. On the front is a 5MP selfie shooter which again didn’t blow us away, but did give us acceptable shots that we wouldn’t be embarrassed to upload to Instagram.. We haven't had the chance to do a great deal with the LG X Power2 yet, and whether this phone is worth buying will come down in large part to whether it can make good on LG's battery life claims.. Lasting two whole days on a charge is still a far-off feature for most flagship phones, so if the X Power2 can manage the feat it could be one of the best budget phones to buy right now.. In the meantime, if you’re desperate for a cheaper device that offers a full two days of battery we’ve tested out the Lenovo P2 and we know that survives for that long, so you may want to buy one of the those instead..

Powerful Addition to LG’s Mass-tier Product Line. Features 4,500mAh Battery and 5.5-inch Display. 24, 2017 — LG X power2, designed for users who specifically seek large battery capacities and big screens for power-heavy multimedia user and gaming enthusiasts, will be unveiled at Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona, Spain.. Each model in the X series incorporates different exclusive features that are usually found only in premium smartphones. The various models offer users a range of differentiated experiences and values that surpass previous mass-tier product lines. The first model in the mass-tier X series to be unveiled this year, the LG X power2 features a powerful 4,500mAh battery to meet the demands of customers who frequently use power-hungry applications and games and enjoy viewing multimedia content such as videos and movies on their smartphones.. The LG X power2 was designed to operate for an entire weekend without recharging. Fully charged, the LG X power2 can playback videos continuously for approximately 15 hours, provide navigational directions for about 14 hours or surf the web for around 18 hours. 1 The LG X power2 incorporates high-speed charging technology demanded by today’s busy users. A one hour charge provides 50 percent battery power with a full charge only requiring about two hours, twice as fast as most phones.. In addition, Comfort View makes reading e-books and web comics more comfortable by reducing the amount of blue light emitted by the display, which has been shown to cause eye fatigue.. The LG X power2 features a 5.5-inch HD In-cell Touch display, offering a large and expanded screen with clear, vivid colors. Moreover, LG has improved the display’s outdoor capability for easy visibility even in strong sunlight. The LG X power2 has a 5MP wide angle camera above the display which enables users to take selfies and wefies of up to eight people without a selfie stick. The 13MP rear camera features Zero Shutter Lag to eliminate the annoying delay between the time the shutter button is pressed and the image is captured. An front-facing soft light LED flash captures group shots with the level of quality usually found only in professional studios.. The smartphone is further differentiated from other mass-tier phones with LG’s exclusive UX for selfies. Auto Shot automatically triggers the front camera’s shutter when a face is detected. Gesture Shot and Gesture Interval Shot reads and responds to hand signals, eliminating the need to press the shutter button which is a common cause of blurry photos. And with Quick Share, users can immediately post images to their favorite social media site with just one tap.. “The LG X power2 has the most powerful battery capacity in LG’s entire smartphone line-up so users can enjoy many hours of multimedia entertainment on its roomy display without worrying about recharging,” said Juno Cho, president of LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company. “The entire X series is all about great technology and great value, both important features for today’s discerning smartphone customer.”.

LG's smartphones of the X series are marketed as superheroes: each has something it excels in,. it was the extra-strong battery which really lasted very long. Of course, the LG X power2 has the same super power. In terms of capacity, the battery has become even slightly larger, the same as the smartphone itself, which now goes over the counter with a 5.5-inch screen. The X power2 is also considerably more expensive than its predecessor. With a price of 299 Euros (~$353) it advances deep into the mid-range, where there are many other devices waiting to compete: the. which has an even higher-capacity battery, for example, or the.

In both devices, the front is completely black and a gray or black stripe goes around the device. The back is either gray or blue, depending on the color choice. Our test unit is the blue variant, which is also slightly glossy, and has a light pinstripe pattern. The case design is more organically round rather than square and therefore fits in the hand comfortably. Perhaps the LG X power2 is not a device with a very exciting design, but it is ergonomic and solid. The case can hardly be twisted and appears to be built very compact. The device does not mind any pressure on the back, but with forceful pressure on the touchscreen you can see waves in the liquid crystal.. The battery of the device cannot be removed, which is not really customary in this price range anyway.. LG X power2 full resolution. LG X power2 full resolution. LG X power2 full resolution.

With only 16 GB of storage, the X power2 remains on par with its predecessor. However, that was 100 Euros (~$118) cheaper, and most of the other devices in the same class as the X power 2 are equipped with 32 GB of storage. The 2 GB working memory is also not in keeping with the times for a device of this price range, 3 GB is the minimum. There is also no modern USB-C connection, but only a classical Micro-USB port. However, NFC, DLNA, Miracast, and USB-OTG are on board. In our configuration, the LG X power 2 has only one SIM card and there is currently no dual-SIM model available in the central European market.. MicroSD cards can be used to expand the storage. They can hold up to 256 GB, although currently there are no cards with more storage available anyway. Although storage cards can only be formatted as external storage, you can also store apps on the external storage card.. Bottom: 3.5-mm audio-combo, microphone, USB port. The operating system of the smartphone is. Android 7.0, which is not the most current version. Moreover, the security patches from April 1 2017 are quite dated at the time of this test, and an update is not available. LG uses on its own launcher, which allows various designs, and optionally groups the setting into categories, but otherwise corresponds to a large extend to the original Android. in terms of operation, so that anyone who had an Android smartphone should easily find their way around.. Although the manufacturer has pre-installed several apps, there are much fewer advertising apps than in the LG X Power. Besides Evernote, there is also no third-party software and the remaining apps are from Google or LG. In addition, there are several direct links to Settings on the start screen or in some folders.. With 300 MBit/s during download and 50 MBit/s during upload, the LG X power2 is as fast in the LTE net as most of the comparison devices. The predecessor cannot keep up anymore. Five LTE bands, four UMTS bands, and four GSM bands are supported. Here, the LG X power2 remains. considerably behind the other competitors with the same price. All of the comparison devices support more. The reception in the inner-city areas of the decent German Vodafone net is reasonable indoors as well. We had at least half the signal strength for LTE most of the time.. The WLAN module transfers according to the 802.11 b/g/n standards. Here, some of the comparison devices can even score with support for the fast 802.11ac standard and almost all support at least the 5 GHz WLAN network. The LG X power2 cannot claim any fast data rates, and in our standardized test it even sends slightly slower than the. In the practical test, the reception is very good near the router, and after a short delay, the pages are rendered fairly quickly. At a distance of 10 meters (~33 ft) from the router and through three walls, the reception is still good, there are 3/4 of the signal strength, and the pages are rendered as quickly as when near the router..

Indoors the GPS module is unable to locate us, but outside it can locate us very quickly and with and accuracy of 3 meters (~10 ft), it is quite exact.. But how does it look in practice? We want to evaluate this in a mountain bike tour, where in addition to the LG X power2 we also take the Garmin Edge 500 professional navigation device that serves as our reference due to its accurate locating abilities. The LG X power2 measures almost exactly the same distance in a 12-km (~7.5 miles) route, which is already very good. Aside from some minor drops in the curves, we have to give credit to the LG X power2 for the accuracy of the GPS module: While the Garmin Edge 500 may be more accurate in some places, the differences are really quite small..

LG has adjusted the Telephone app slightly. It is kept in the same overall light design as the user interface and is slightly more adjustable than Google's standard app. You can, for example, specify which screen should appear when starting the app. Otherwise, there are the same tabs such as the lists of calls and contacts. You can also create your own groups.. The voice quality is passable, and even though the earpiece can become quite loud, it then becomes boomy. Our conversation partner is slightly muffled, but still easily understandable. The microphone can record even low voices, the recording is also a little muffled though. You can call using the also quite loud and boomy speaker which also reproduces the voice of your partner slightly muffled. When using the speaker, the microphone cannot record a low voice anymore.. In terms of camera resolution, with 13 megapixels in the back and 5 megapixels in the front, the LG X power2 lies within a normal range for the current mid-range smartphones. show that you can also get even more megapixels for the same price. But the megapixel count is not that important for the image quality anyway. The image sharpness and color display are more important. Here the back camera shows quite cool colors, and the sharpness seems to be decent as long as you do not zoom in, which makes muddy areas and a generally mediocre sharpness clearly noticeable. The dynamic in dark and bright areas could also be better. In the details, high-quality smartphones are clearly ahead. is also compelling with a more detailed and sharper representation here. In low-light conditions, the LG X power2 can also not score. Here as well, for example the. Videos can be recorded in Full HD quality with 30 fps. The quality is fairly good, although in darker situations you can quickly see some image noise. The sharpness and color presentation are similar to the pictures: superficially okay, but slightly muddy in the detail.. The 5-Megapixel front camera has trouble taking really sharp pictures, and the dynamic is also lacking.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. In the next step, the main camera of the LG X power2 goes back into the test lab, where we re-examine the color display under controlled light conditions. Here the image sharpness is quite decent in parts of the image, and also the display of text in front of a colored background brings a decent result. In the left image area in particular, the sharpness declines visibly, and the edges appear fuzzy over the whole image. The color representation deviates from the reference value more in some colors, and in others it is relatively accurate. Overall, it is an average result in the color representation.. How should we judge the performance of the camera? For those who mainly keep their pictures on the camera and only rarely take pictures in low light, the camera will be sufficient. However, there are much better camera modules in this price range. The front camera takes rather mediocre pictures, even if you have low expectations.. Picture of ColorChecker colors: the bottom half of each patch shows the original color.. Besides the charger and the USB cable, there are also earphones in the box of the LG X power2. According to the manufacturer's website, there are no special accessories for the LG X power2.. LG offers 24 months of warranty for the smartphone.. LG has developed its own keyboard app which the manufacturer uses for its smartphones. Other keyboard apps are not pre-installed on the LG X power2, but can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. The LG keyboard has a separate row with number keys as well as separate keys for the umlauts. In addition, there are extensive options to configure the keyboard. You can split the keyboard with a gesture, or move it towards the edge in order to use it with one hand. Vibration and sounds, pop-ups and word suggestions, there are many options overall.. The operation via touchscreen works quickly and very well, the surface is comfortable, and the screen is also very responsive in the corners. Gesture controls are integrated to a small extent: You can tap twice on the screen to turn off or activate the screen, but this only works on the Start screen.. The standby button is on the right side, and the volume rocker on the left. All the buttons cannot be seen clearly from the front, but you can easily feel them. The pressure point of the standby button feels slightly spongy. As a secondary function, the volume rocker can activate the camera or a notepad from standby mode. The volume lowering key can be used as a shutter release.. With 1280x720 pixels, the 5.5-inch display has the customary number of pixels in this price range. show that for about 300 Euros (~$354), a Full HD display is not a luxury anymore. Furthermore, the brightness of the LG X power2 is considerably lower at an average of 237 cd/mÂ² than in all the comparison devices. Even the predecessor offered considerably more. At least at 92%, the brightness distribution is enough so that even larger color areas appear evenly.. 232 cd/m² 236 cd/m² 225 cd/m² 239 cd/m² 237 cd/m² 238 cd/m² 244 cd/m² 245 cd/m² 240 cd/m². 92 % Center on Battery: 237. cd/m²) ΔE Color 5.5 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 6.1 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.07.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8995 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. black value, the LG X power2 is exemplary for an IPS display. The problem with this is that many competing devices are at this point using AMOLED displays, which can display absolute black. Due to the relatively low brightness, the contrast ratio is also worse than in the. Apparently the LG X power2 does not use pulse width modulation to reduce the brightness in low settings, at least we are not noticing any flickering.. While testing the display more thoroughly with the CalMAN software and the spectral photometer, we noticed a slight blue tint, which can be reduced by the blue filter. The coverage of the sRGB color space is rather limited, and the color deviations are higher than in some other comparison devices..

This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.2 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The display is really too dark for using it outdoors. In maximum brightness, you can still recognize a little of the contents, if the surroundings are not too bright. If you tilt the smartphone to the side, the display darkens further. To be fair, this is more noticeable to the camera than to the eyes.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Mediatek MT6750 is built into the LG X power2 as the SoC. It possesses four cores and clocks at a maximum of 1.5 GHz. The performance is noticeably higher than that of its predecessor, but cannot keep up with the Lenovo P2 or the Moto Z Play. Overall, the LG X power2 places in the middle of the field of the comparison devices. In everyday use, you can surf all the menus smoothly and all the apps we tested also ran without any problems.. The graphics unit is called ARM Mali-T860 MP2 , possesses two cores, and clocks at up to 700 MHz.

While accessing our Toshiba Exceria Pro M401 reference microSD card, the LG X power2 shows its good side again. It achieves considerably higher values than the LG X Power. and can even keep up with the fastest comparison devices.

The absolutely highest case temperature that we reach in our test is 40.6 Â°C (~105 Â°F) at the back of the case. The heating is very limited, it is noticeable, but not critical at all. In the front, the device also warms up under full load, but at 37.4 Â°C (~99Â°F) it is less. While idling, there is hardly any noticeable warming and we measured a maximum of 31.2 Â°C (~88 Â°F).. With the help of the Manhattan 3.1 battery benchmark in GFXBench we can test whether the device can maintain its performance even during prolonged loads.

Many smartphone manufacturers no longer place the loudspeaker at the back, since it could easily be covered by the hand or is muffled when the smartphone sits on the table. Nevertheless, LG has decided to continue placing the speaker in the back, and accordingly you have to live with a more muffled sound when the device sits on the desk in front of you. If you lift it up, the sound becomes much clearer and the speaker can become noticeably loud. We measure up to 89.4 dB(A) in the test lab. Another positive is that the speaker does not distort even at high volumes. The bass is even less present than in many other comparison devices and there are almost no lower mids either. Accordingly, the lab test shows bad results. However the subjective impression of the speaker is not quite as bad. Of course, the sound of high-quality smartphones is much fuller and warmer, but since the sound is reproduced clearly and undistorted, you can give the music a quick listen sometimes, and the video sound also comes out of the speaker clearly.. Listening through the 3.5-mm port and the included earphones is also clearly possible. The audio signal is also transferred clearly and cleanly to external speakers via Bluetooth.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 36.5 25 25.4 33 31 25.3 33.4 40 32.9 32.2 50 33.6 34.3 63 31.6 31.1 80 28.4 26.2 100 27 28.5 125 20.8 29.4 160 22 29.4 200 21.3 30 250 20.8 31.5 315 21.2 31.7 400 19.4 37.6 500 19.5 44.9 630 17.7 54.9 800 17.9 64.2 1000 17.8 73 1250 17.3 77.9 1600 17.4 77.1 2000 16.7 78.1 2500 17.2 76.5 3150 18.2 73.9 4000 17.9 77.3 5000 17.6 76.6 6300 17.7 79.9 8000 17.8 84.4 10000 17.9 80.9 12500 18.1 72.2 16000 18.2 62.3 SPL 30 89.4 N 1.3 72.3 median 17.9 LG X power2 median 72.2 Delta 1.3 17.9 31.6 30.8 25.4 30.5 25.3 31.2 32.9 30.7 33.6 31.7 31.6 28.8 28.4 22.6 27 26 20.8 36.8 22 40.2 21.3 49.2 20.8 53.7 21.2 57.1 19.4 62.6 19.5 67.4 17.7 67.8 17.9 69.5 17.8 70.7 17.3 72.1 17.4 74.6 16.7 75.2 17.2 75.5 18.2 77.9 17.9 81.4 17.6 79 17.7 75.6 17.8 75.4 17.9 71.3 18.1 62.6 18.2 55.8 30 87.1 1.3 70.5 median 17.9 Samsung Galaxy J7 2017 median 69.5 1.3 10.6 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Whereas before, the LG X power2 was in the middle of the field of comparison devices in terms of the performance, it is on top in the power consumption, which in this case is not good news. At least when it is turned off, it really uses no power at all and the consumption in standby mode is also okay. But as soon as you turn on the device, it uses more power in every scenario than all the other comparison devices. The predecessor was also considerably more energy efficient. At 7.85 watts during maximum load, it uses even more than twice as much as the. There is an energy saving mode, which is automatically activated when the battery reaches 15%. Of course you can turn off this feature, if you always want to have the full power available..

Despite the high power consumption, the 4500 mAh battery provides a good battery life to the LG X power2. However, it has not improved compared to the predecessor, which has a weaker battery. Our test unit can also beat the. with its much smaller battery by only 3% overall.. In the WLAN test, the X power2 achieves a runtime of 16:22 hours. This is a very good value with which the device lasts for two working days even with continuous surfing. In practice, with mixed usage you should last about as long as with the LG X Power, which is to say, three to four days before the device has to be recharged.

In the test: LG X power2. Test unit provided by LG Germany.. A smartphone with X â this time it did not work out. The LG X power2 is not really a bad device; it is only that there are many similarly priced devices that are better. To make the X power2 100 Euros (~$118) more expensive than the. is not easily justifiable in our opinion. There is a little more performance, the screen is a little bigger, and the battery capacity is a little larger. Otherwise the measurements of the LG X power2 are even worse in parts than those of the predecessor, for example in the power consumption or display brightness.. There are quite a few positive points in the LG X power2 as well: we like the case and it is quite sturdy, the performance is fairly good for the price range, the speaker is quite loud and does not distort, and the device remains cool and does not throttle under load. Of course the battery life is also considerable, but other devices in this price range such as the. In addition, through the additional charge of 100 Euros. (~$118), LG's smartphone of the second generation arrived in a completely new competition class without being adjusted accordingly: The screen has a lower resolution than many competing devices, the camera takes pictures that are less good, and the provided storage is at the lower end of the competition. We are agreeably surprised that the GPS module works quite accurately. However, the WLAN transfer rates are low, and it supports less LTE bands than the competing devices.. The LG X power2 is simply too expensive for the offered features: a low resolution display, weak camera, and only mediocre performance values. The long battery life is a good selling point, but at this point other devices of this price range have this as well.. Anyone simply looking for a smartphone with a long battery life and willing to spend the money receives a fairly well-equipped smartphone with the LG X power2. offer clearly more for the money.

While there’s still a lot to be desired in the camera and design department, it’s not fair to demand the device excel in all quadrants. The LG X Power 2 stayed true to its roots and focused on battery, delivering a market-leading lifespan coupled with improved performance.. While there’s still a lot to be desired in the camera and design department, it’s not fair to demand the device excel in all quadrants. As with most budget phones, it picked a niche, and within that niche it’s thriving.. With an all-weekend battery and a reasonable price both on and off-contract, I’d recommend the X Power 2 to those who are looking for the basics, but with an uber-dependable twist.. Promises a long battery life with its high-capacity battery. The LG X Power 2 is simply too expensive for the offered features: a low resolution display, weak camera, and only mediocre performance values. The long battery life is a good selling point, but at this point other devices of this price range have this as well..

LG's X power was a unique phone focused almost exclusively on having an unusually large battery. This year's update improves almost every spec, including battery size (naturally), screen size, camera resolution, and memory. With fast charging, it's a battery beast. What's it like in person? We find out.. A phone that comes with a huge battery is a great idea. Who wouldn't want that? The new X power2 boost the battery from 4,100 mAh (already huge) to 4,500 mAh. And it does it in a phone that's not obnoxiously huge or heavy.. If you hold it on its own, it feels like a normal phone. It's only when you compare it to its sibling the Stylus 3 (Stylo 3) that you realize it is slightly thicker and heavier than the average large-screen phone.. The X power2 and Stylus 3 are actually both variants of the K10. In fact, buried in the settings screens, the X power2 calls itself the "K10 Power", just like the Stylus 3 calls itself the "K10 pro".. The new design of this X power makes sense when you realize it's actually part of this year's K-series. Whereas the first X power had a distinctive rectangular design, these new models all share a design language that looks like a generic, cheap Android phone from five years ago. While the rest of the industry is trying very hard to bring premium design to affordable phones, LG seems to be doing the opposite.. With that said, the X power2 does look and feel a notch better than the rest of the K series. The side buttons look and feel cheap, but the back has a nice finish that feels better than your average plastic back. In the right light, the front looks handsome, if generic.. The X power2 is heavier than average due to the huge battery inside, but it's not bothersome, perhaps due to the large screen that balances out the density. The added weight does add a perception of significance and therefore quality.. The rest of the specs are not high-end, but should provide quite a good value if pricing is in line with its predecessor. There's a 5.5-inch HD screen, NFC, fast charging, and a 13-megapixel main camera. The 5-megapixel front camera has a wide-angle lens and an LED selfie flash.. The first X power came to Cricket, Sprint, Virgin, Boost, and U.S. We were told to expect a roughly similar lineup of U.S. LG's X Power 2 Packs a 4,500mAh Battery. LG today announced the X power2, a follow up to last year's bountiful, battery-boasting handset. The X power2 features an embedded 4,500mAh battery that LG says delivers 15 hours of video playback, 14 hours of real-time navigations, or 18 hours of web surfing.. LG Begins Rollout of the X Power2 Battery-Packed Handset. LG today said the X power2 is now available in North America and other markets. The X power2 features an embedded 4,500mAh battery that LG says delivers 15 hours of video playback, 14 hours of real-time navigation, or 18 hours of web surfing.. LG Intros the X charge, an Xfinity Mobile Exclusive. LG today announced the X charge, a smartphone that puts a priority on battery life. Similar to last year's X power, the X charge has an enormous battery with a capacity of 4,500mAh.. LG Q6 to Come to U.S. Amazon today announced that it will soon offer a slew of LG Android smartphones through its Amazon Prime Exclusives program. Among them is the LG Q6 (pictured), marking the first time this particular phone is being made available to U.S.. Cricket Offering 2 Lines of Unlimited Service for $80. Cricket Wireless today annouced new service and handset promotions meant to entice customers to sign up for the prepaid carrier. To start, Cricket is offering new and existing customers two lines of unlimited service for $80 per month.. LG X Charge / X power2 / Fiesta. 2 GB RAM 4,500 mAh battery. Headphone Jack (3.5mm), Memory Card Slot. It's a SCAM that this is even a thing. If manufacturers were not sealing away their batteries despite obvious consumer preference to the contrary, a consumer would be able to buy the phone of their choice and choose to buy a larger 3rd party battery if they needed or wanted one. They would never even have to weigh the pros and cons of buying a crappy model with a longer battery life. LG has created a false demand by taking something away from their customers only to re-offer it as a feature. Shame on LG for even making this device. And shame on all the other manufacturers for screwing their customers as well.. First off, give LG some credit: They tried removable batteries in the G5 last year. As for your larger point, I really want to agree with you, but... XL battery options made a lot more sense back in the day. whats it have for ram and processor? i have an original x power and the thing is a slug. the battery would last for days if you never used the phone. as soon as you did it would get warm and the battery would die as fast as any other phone..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Looks like part of the phone. The cover came on time, and thanks to reviews I knew I was ordering a slender soft plastic case. I'm able to insert it in a wallet-type case when I leave the house, but for my needs this was a good purchase. It's a snug fit, which is great, and the cut-outs for the camera lens and speaker are fine. The speaker cut-out is a little off-center, but the speaker shows completely. Many of the other cases have a small slit instead of a round opening for the round speaker. All in all, the case looks like it's part of the phone, which is what I wanted.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great fit and feel. Phone without a case is very slippery but this adds an extra amount of grip/friction and, of course, protection for a drop. Very easy to slip on and off. Buttons still feel very good with good control. The case has to be removed to access the sim/SD card but the case is easy to remove and reinstall. I also put on a screen protector. This case doesn't come over the edge very far so there is no conflict.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great fit for the LG Fiesta LTE. This is the second case I've ordered for my LG Fiesta LTE and by far the best. It is a hard rubber material with a snug fit. It's quite grippy and appears to offer a fair amount of protection from light drops.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Cracked but phone didn't. Corner cracked the first time I dropped it but my phone did not get damaged. I did however buy a different case that hopefully won't crack when dropped.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Looks good and isn't bulky.

Super Powerful Battery and Excellent Feature Set for a Mid-Priced Phone.. By Sheldon Cwinn | 17 Jul 2016. It has the standard features of Android 6.0 Mrshmellow with a bunch of LG tools to improve the Operating System (the keyboard being just one example.) But the best single feature of this easy to operate device is the battery. It can last for 3-4 days on a single charge and that is with a ton of data usage and calls as well, and it recharges in about 45 minutes. It is my dram come true!. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 3 out of 3 people found this review helpful. By Abub Momy | 17 Oct 2016. Fast charging 2hours 0-100% amazing battery. Was this review helpful? Yes No. By Thomas Steele | 29 Dec 2016. I just recently purchased the LG X Power as i wanted to upgrade to a phone with a gyroscope for use with google cardboard. However, upon opening the box and turning on the phone I discovered that it does NOT have a gyroscope as listed in the sensors section here. A download of CPU Z and a message that my phone was incompatible with the cardboard app confirm this fact. Do not buy if you want a phone with a gyro.. Was this review helpful?
