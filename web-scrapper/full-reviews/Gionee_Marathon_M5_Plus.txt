Gionee Marathon M5 Plus With 5020mAh Battery, 6-Inch Display Launched. Gadgets 360 Staff , 21 December 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Gionee on Monday launched the Marathon M5 Plus smartphone at an event held in Dongguan, China. The company said the Marathon M5 Plus is an upgrade over the Marathon M5 , which it launched in June 2015. Disclosure: Gionee India sponsored the correspondent's flights and accommodation for this event.. Gionee Marathon M5 Enjoy With 5.5-Inch Display, 5000mAh Battery Launched ). The Gionee Marathon M5 Plus has been priced at CNY 2,499 (roughly Rs. 24,990) and will be available in China from December 25, 2015. The company also announced a price cut in China for the M5 smartphone. The M5 has now been priced at CNY 1,999 (roughly Rs. India pricing and availability have not yet been revealed.. Readers should note that this product has been launched in China and its India variant may have slightly different hardware and software specifications, according to Gionee .. The big selling point of the Gionee Marathon M5 Plus touted by the company is the smartphone's long battery life. While the Marathon M5 Plus features a smaller 5020mAh battery when compared to the Marathon M5, Gionee claims that it has optimised the battery to reduce the drop in its capacity over time. The company claims that the Marathon M5 Plus' battery retains 90 percent (4500mAh) of its original capacity after 600 charging cycles. Gionee says this translates to roughly 2 years of use.. Gionee claims that it has worked on reducing power consumption on the software level as well. The smartphone will alert users about apps that drain the smartphone's battery. Gionee also touted the Marathon M5 Plus' fast charging ability, claiming that it can be charged from zero to 100 percent in 117 minutes. It said this smartphone features double charging chips that allow users to charge it quickly without overheating. The Marathon M5 Plus has a metal body. Gionee says the battery is covered with a stainless steel cover for a sturdier build.. The Marathon M5 Plus ships with Gionee's Amigo 3.1 OS based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. It features a 6-inch (1080x1920 pixel) Amoled display with a pixel density of 368ppi. It is powered by an unspecified octa-core CPU, coupled with 3GB of RAM. The Marathon M5 Plus comes with 64GB of built-in storage that's expandable via microSD card (up to 128GB).. William Lu, CEO of Gionee, said, "M5 Plus is the new generation business from Gionee. Only large display makes a premium phone." That's why the M5 Plus has a 6-inch screen, Lu said. Gionee said the smartphone features an Amoled screen that continues to respond fast even at -35 degrees Celsius. Lu claimed that LCD displays have a delayed response from -20 degrees Celsius, with a dig at the iPhone which features an LCD display.. The M5 Plus also features a fingerprint scanner on the home button, much like Apple's Touch ID. Lu said, "The other day I asked on Weibo whether users would like a fingerprint identifier at the back or front. Nearly 80 percent users voted for a front fingerprint identifier." He said that having the sensor at the front allows for much faster unlocking and claimed that the Marathon M5 Plus' fingerprint sensor has a response time of 0.1s and fingerprint identification time of 0.38s.. Gionee's Marathon series of phones are known for long battery life. To achieve that, these phones compromise on thickness and weight. All phones in this series are heavier and bulkier than usual, thanks to their huge battery capacities. This addresses a crucial aspect of today's smartphones by increasing their battery life, but not everyone might be comfortable with a heavier smartphone.. On the software front, Gionee has included several new features, including Ami Clone. This lets users backup all data on their smartphone and when they restore, it also remembers minor details such as the arrangement of icons on the home screen. The OS also comes with a child mode that lets users limit the apps children access and the time they're allowed to use these apps. This mode can be activated or deactivated via a password or the fingerprint sensor..

Launched in December 2015, the Gionee Marathon M5 Plus had one single purpose and that was to be the successor to the Gionee Marathon M5. The older M5 packed in a massive 6020 mAh and also came with a narrow form factor apart from the additional weight. At the launch we were treated to a successor that cut down on both the heft and the battery with some new upgrades in terms of software and hardware.. Unfortunately for Gionee, plenty has changed since December 2015. Manufacturers have introduced new chipsets and components to the market that are not just powerful, but energy efficient as well. Take for example the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. with its Snapdragon 650 that takes on most flagships from 2015 with its Cortex-A72 and Cortex-A53 cores and it costs just Rs 9,999 (16GB).. So in what appears to be a much delayed launch with a hefty Rs 26,999 price tag, where does this mammoth stand among the new smartphones? Let’s find out.. We were not exactly fans of the original Gionee Marathon M5’s design that looked chubby at best and was heavy to carry as well. Gionee has certainly improved on that and made the Plus not just slimmer, but also managed to pack in a bigger 6-inch display in what appears to be a similar footprint.. The phone thanks to its smaller but efficient battery is also lighter at (a still heavy) 208 grams than the previous model’s 211 grams. The older smartphone was definitely easier to hold thanks to the narrow (yet chubby) design and the Plus losses out on some points for that.. While we did not like plastic inserts at the top and bottom ends on the back, we did like the 2.5D glass on the front (shown above) that gave the smartphone a polished look that definitely trumps its successor.. The volume keys and the power button are on the right side, while the USB Type C port, mic and 3.5mm headphone jack take up the bottom.. Not on our likes list is the new Gionee branding on the back that felt like a sticker even though it was etched on the metal back cover.. We had the gold model in for review and although we are not fans of gold, we did appreciate the fit and finish of the panels that felt seamless, smooth and polished.. As mentioned at the beginning of this review, the Gionee Marathon M5 Plus is indeed a bit late to the Indian market. Still, it will appeal to big screen fans as it manages to deliver a great screen-to-body ratio.. We get a 6-inch AMOLED Full HD display on the front. MT6735 clocked at 1.3GHz with Cortex A53 cores that is also found in the InFocus Bingo 50 entry-level smartphone we reviewed recently. The chipset is paired with 3GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB using a microSD card.. As for the cameras we get a 13MP f/2.0 unit with PDAF that is accompanied by a single LED flash on the back. On the front there is a 5MP f/2.2 aperture unit for selfies.. Connectivity options include 4G bands, Wi-fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.0, A-GPS and an FM Radio. Add to this a USB Type-C connector for charging and data transfers. Also available on the front is a fingerprint reader that is quick, but not unbelievably quick like the one we used on the Oppo F1 Plus .. Powering it all is a non-removable 5020mAh battery which utilizes two chips to charge the smartphone quickly and is also expected to retain its capacity after 600 charge cycles.. The 6-inch AMOLED display does pack in plenty of punch and shows saturated colours as many would expect from display of this type. And this shows, even when held in direct sunlight with text being legible and images looking as colourful (not washed out) as we would like it to be. Viewing angles were pretty good as well and handset made for a great PMP thanks to the battery and display combination that seemed to work well in power saver modes.. We did however, experience a green tinge on the display, but it was only visible when viewed at steep angles and did not hamper our multimedia experience.. While the auto-brightness worked fine and was quick enough to adapt to the various lighting scenarios that we were using it in, we wished that the ‘LCD effect’ setting (odd right?) in the display had a customisable setting as we found the display a bit too vivid in most situations.. Having used the older Gionee Marathon M5 , the software on the Plus does feel (ever so little) like an upgrade. Nothing has changed underneath the Amigo OS apart from a couple of new additions and plenty of additional bloatware that cannot be uninstalled. The Android base version also remains at 5.1 Lollipop, which is pretty old and could definitely do with an upgrade (or two).. Talking about the pre-installed apps there’s tonnes of them. From games, to app stores, to stuff that we just did not want to play around with like 360 Security Lite to Du Battery Saver, all of which we placed in a ‘Unused’ folder. Thankfully, we could uninstall most of them.. As for the UI you get the standard layout with all the icons laid out on the homescreen with no app drawer. Then you have the iOS-inspired control centre that is accessible with a swipe from the display’s bottom edge. Adding to the swiping confusion, swiping upwards anywhere else on the display gets you access to the (secret) homescreen editing menu that will also let you change themes and edit the desktop.. The interface is fairly standard and nothing refreshing. In fact, the default theme seems to be inspired by Samsung's TouchWiz, while the pre-installed wallpapers were the result of some bad Photoshop work. We did however have access to a theme store that saved the day with its massive selection of themes.. Also worth mentioning is the Chameleon app that lets you pick colours from the environment around you and change the colour palette of the theme. An additional mention goes to the new app called the Gionee Abroad Service that was also showcased at the launch event.. The app simply acts as a companion app when you are travelling abroad and will also let you track flights, check the weather, maintain checklists and add memos. All-in-all the Abroad Service is a handy app but nothing substantial out here.. With a MediaTek MT6735 performance should not have been a problem. But we did notice some stuttering in the multi-tasking menu and other places, like when swiping through the homescreen.. These are minor and often creep up when there is a game or a heavy app running in the background. Clearing the RAM kills the glitch but we think this is more to do with the Android Lollipop base than anything else.. The older Android software also meant that the heavily skinned OS often felt a bit slow and not buttery smooth. To give you a comparison, the InFocus Bingo 50 (a budget smartphone) with the same specs and Android 6.0 Marshmallow managed to run a lot smoother and stutter free. We think this was something to do with their choice of a 720p display instead of the Full HD one onboard the M5 Plus.. The audio quality while listening to music via the headphones was really good. The DTS was not exactly to our liking, but it did enhance the audio to quite an extent. Also available was an equalizer with preset effects and a user-customisable one. Audio output through the speakers on the back was sufficiently loud, but it did sound a bit empty. We do think this is more of placement problem as the speaker is pointed away from the user.. Coming to call quality, we faced no issues whatsoever. The handset offers HD voice as well and conversations at both ends could be heard loud and clear.. Gaming was not such a great experience given the processor at hand. Casual games worked fine and ran smoothly without any hiccups, but the same cannot be said about graphic intensive games that raised the processor temperatures a bit. Still then, it was not too hot and neither did performance take a hit. The handset cooled down much faster than it heated up. Games like Asphalt 8: Airborne , Modern Combat 5 did not play well and stuttered throughout. Dead Trigger 2 on the other hand ran pretty smoothly. The big screen is definitely a plus point for this handset.. The camera onboard the Gionee Marathon M5 did a fairly average job considering its price tag. While we do understand that the sole purpose of this phone is to be a road warrior and deliver battery life, may be Gionee could have skipped on the camera altogether and made it clear.. The images we got did get the saturation levels right but that’s about it. While the Full HD AMOLED display did a great job of showcasing those images, the sensor did a good job by actually recording the right colour saturation levels. So we were sure that they weren’t deceiving. The same can be said about the white balance levels as well. But as for the rest of them, it was nowhere close to where we wanted it to be.. The camera’s autofocus mechanism (with PDAF) was simply not quick enough, nor did it accurately lock focus most of the time. This became an even bigger problem in dim or low light situations. The highlights were blown and rarely did we get any good results even with the HDR mode turned on.. One will really need the lighting scenario to be just right when using this camera (indeed most of the times it is not). There’s purple fringing all over and it is noticeable. The ISO levels creep up in almost every light setting no matter whether it was low light or daylight, which is a bit disappointing.. In short, you can only get good photographs with this camera if you are pointing in the direction of the light (still the autofocus does not lock accurately). Anything else and the results are far from impressive.. The front facing camera saw similar results, but the images looked better because of the distance from the subject (usually at arm’s length) but add a little opposing light and they get ruined.. However, video recording was pretty good and showcased smooth and steady frame rates, but the troubled auto focus mechanism would suddenly falter ruining some videos.. As expected, the M5 Marathon Plus delivered when it comes to battery life. And it can help you get some more juice when needed by including a number of power saver modes under Power Management in Settings. While we did get a day and half of battery life with casual use on just 4G networks, turning on the Standby Intelligent Power Saving checkbox helps take it to 2 days, which is pretty good.. But one should note, that like every other power saver mode on an Android smartphone, you may miss a couple of notifications, as the smartphone will turn off data to save power from time to time. This also means that it will sync data only when you switch it on or according to its own schedule depending on the battery life available.. Using the camera frequently will bring down that two day battery life and by quite a big margin. When taking camera samples, we noticed that the battery life did drop quickly. Overall, it gets the job done, but it comes at the price of a heavier smartphone.. For what it was supposed to offer, the Gionee Marathon M5 Plus does deliver plenty. You get battery life that you can depend on and a large AMOLED display that works well both outdoors and indoors.. But the company really needs to ramp up with its software. And while this did not make much of difference earlier (older versions of Android), it does today. Marshmallow is a big improvement over Lollipop and for those who have been left behind; the cracks are beginning to show. The software experience could have been smoother even though it was polished with the Amigo UI.. While the hardware was doable, the chunky software easily hampers the experience. Moreover with such a big display at hand, we did expect a custom DPI scaling solution where we would have been able to see more lines of text rather than just smaller text. Indeed, this is an opportunity that went to waste, but it could be implemented with future updates.. The camera was not up to the mark and that is something to be concerned about when you have an older generation chipset and Rs 26,999 price tag to defend. There are better phones in the market like the recently reviewed Oppo F1 Plus that is an all-rounder and can run circles around the M5 Plus with everything other than battery life and costs Rs 26,990. And it is light as well. Then we have the Xiaomi Mi. 5 , which thanks to its pricing (Rs 24,999), presents a value for money offering with an impressive spec sheet, a capable camera and good battery life.. Right now with its Rs 26,999 price tag, it is just a case of too little, too late for the Gionee Marathon M5 Plus. And we would recommend this smartphone only if battery life is your priority.. The Gionee Marathon M5 Plus features a 6.0-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels and is powered by a 1.3GHz octa core processor and has 3GB of RAM. It comes with 64GB of inbuilt storage, expandable upto 128GB and has a 13.0-megapixel rear camera and 5.0-megapixel front camera. It comes with Android 5.1 Lollipop OS and support a 5020mAh battery capacity with 3G & 4G.. 81.2 x 8.4 x 160.9 mm. Published Date: May 09,2016 02:55 pm. | Updated Date: May 09, 2016 02:55 pm.

Jul 7, 2016, 07.52 AM IST. 1 / 6 Gionee Marathon M5 Plus. The Gionee Marathon M5 Plus is the largest phone on test here, but still maintains a reasonably slim profile. At 208g, it is also the heaviest, thanks to the 5020mAh battery that's housed inside its metallic body. Colours on its 6-inch scratch-resistant Full HD display appear warm, look vibrant, while text is displayed crisply and is even legible in direct sunlight. This phone runs a customized version of Android Lollipop with pre-loaded apps to boost speed and battery, a child mode and its own app store. You also get an advanced screenshot tool (that lets you capture screen grabs of an entire or specific part of a web page), a call recording facility, and support for gestures. Audio output is clear, though the speaker sounds tinny. The M5 Plus fares better with earphones. Its DTS Audio optimization makes music sounds balanced, with just the right amount of bass and clear highs. Like the Oppo F1 Plus, you get equalizer presets and the option to customize output. On the performance front, the M5 Plus lags behind all the devices reviewed here, though it's large display works best for Full HD movie playback, web browsing and working with documents. Photographs captured with its cameras are average when compared to the OnePlus 3 and the Oppo F1 Plus, which are similarly priced. Colours appear natural but certain details are lost in image softening. Its focusing is sluggish and at times is inaccurate while shooting subjects against a high-contrast background. In low light, there is visible noise and the lack of background. In low light, there is visible noise and the lack of optical image stabilization (OIS) results in blurry shots. The wide-angled front snapper, coupled with the large screen, is good for group shots. Its camera app includes a number of photo filters and shooting modes, including a barcode scanner, a Polaroid feature, and a text-straightening tool. One of the biggest draws of the M5 Plus is its whopper of a battery that gives you almost two days of service on a single charge. Plus, you also get dedicated dual-SIM and microSD slots, unlike the hybrid ones seen on the Oppo and Coolpad.. 2 / 6 5 smartphones that can be 'flagship killers'. You don't have to spend big bucks to pick up a high performance smartphone. Here are five fresh mid-range flagship devices that give the big boys a run for their money.. The OnePlus 3 is crafted out of a single slab of space-grade aluminium that makes it smooth to touch, solid to hold, and gives it a premium look. At 7.3mm, it is one of the slimmest smartphones on test here, second only to the Oppo F1 Plus. The phone's scratch-resistant Full HD display is bright, without being harsh on the eyes, and renders true colours with excellent contrast. Images appear sharp and text is crisp. A “night mode" setting in the notification area lets you cut glare when reading in poor light. OnePlus 3 notched the highest scores in all the synthetic benchmarks with the Le Max2 coming a close second. It even surpassed certain flagship devices like the Samsung S7 that cost twice as much. In real world usage, this phone works fluidly while handling and switching between productivity tasks, resource-intensive games and high-definition multimedia. You won't be disappointed with its audio output either. Music sounds balanced, with tight bass lines, crisp vocals and clear highs. Its cameras are quick to respond and capture details with natural colours. The output is good enough for postcard-sized snapshot prints. The rear camera fared quite well in dim settings as well, albeit with some noise, but still had enough detail and were evenly lit. The OnePlus 3's camera app sports the stock Android Marshmallow interface, so you get basic modes like Auto, Panorama, Time-lapse, Slow motion and Manual. You can also take “raw" captures, like with DSLR cameras, which you can then edit in processing software like Adobe Lightroom. Even though the OnePlus 3 runs Oxygen OS ­ a customized version of Android ­ it is devoid of any bloatware. You only get subtle additions like gesture control and the ability to configure the colour of the notification LED, functions of the touch and homescreen buttons. Its processing muscle and punchy display does take a toll on the battery life. You can expect to get a day's worth of use from this dual SIM handset, which is not very impressive. But you get a fast-charger that can get the battery up to 70% of its total capacity in just half an hour.. Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime (Black, 3GB RAM + 32GB Memory) ₹ 12990. 4 / 6 Oppo F1 Plus. At 6.6mm, the Oppo F1 Plus is the slimmest smartphone on test here. It boasts of a smooth metal build with curved edges, along with a Gorilla Glass 4 display for a premium look that's on a par with the OnePlus 3. Colours on its Full HD screen are vivid; text appears sharp and legible even in bright environs. This is the only device in this roundup that boasts of a higher resolution front cam (16MP) when compared to its rear snapper (13MP). Selfies taken in well-lit conditions appear soft on closer inspection, and are print worthy and fantastic for sharing online. Additionally, you can use the camera's “screen flash" setting to take pictures in low light. These snapshots suffer from some grain, but work well enough for sharing on the web. The rear camera fared better in daylight, taking sharp detailed macro shots. However, low-light shots are not as impressive as the output from the OnePlus 3. Working on documents, watching high-definition movies and multi-tasking between apps is a smooth affair. However, the F1 Plus is not primed for heavy-duty gaming like the Le Max2 and OnePlus 3. And while its customized interface doesn't include bloatware, you get additional features like configurable gesture support and built-in anti-virus baked into the system. Its speakers are loud enough for audio playback. And with earphones, it only gets better with deep bass and clear treble. You also get a graphic equalizer to tweak output. Still, we preferred the One Plus3 and Le Max2 for their nuanced sound but that would just be nit picking. On the battery front, you can expect a full day's worth of service of mixed usage. Its fast-charging system will have your battery back to 100% within an hour.. 5 / 6 LeEco Le Max 2. The Le Max2 is a hefty all-metal smartphone that feels substantial in your hand. It is rather simple in design, but makes a statement with its crisp, 5.7-inch, ultra hi-res Quad HD Gorilla Glass 3 display , which is capable of bright colours that work well for outdoor visibility. This handset packs the same processing muscle as the OnePlus 3 and performs just as well, posting impressive benchmark scores. In real-world tests, it handles demanding apps and multitasking with ease, making it a great device for gaming and movie watching, given its slightly larger screen. The Max2 does heat up a wee bit at times after extended use, but this is not something to worry about. Its rear shooter captures frames quickly and is capable of quality print-worthy shots with neutral colours in well-lit environs. In low light, its output is good enough for sharing on the web. The front camera performs similarly , but with a slight lag that ­ in a few instances ­ result in blurry selfies. Notably, you can set the fingerprint sensor to trigger the rear snapper's shutter. Still, overall, this device does not match up to standards set by the OnePlus 3. The customized user interface on this device comes with a few modifications and the inclusion of video on demand services like Levidi and Le Live, which let you watch movies and regional videos for free for the first year. After that, you can sign up for an annual subscription plan. It is the only device in this roundup with a built-in infrared remote control, which you can use to operate your television, air conditioner and set-top box. This feature works well as a universal remote with well-known electronics brands, with a fair representation of local manufacturers as well. It is also the first handset to replace the 3.5mm audio jack with the USB Type-C interface with CDLA (Continual Digital Lossless Audio) technology, so you have to use the earphones included with the Le Max2. Le Eco would like you to believe that CDLA does wonders for audio output, and while it is capable of crisp balanced sound, most users would not be able to discern the difference with their standard MP3 files. Also, you will have to use the included adapter to connect your regular 3.5mm headphone to this device, which can prove to be a minor annoyance. That said, the Max2 ­ like the OnePlus 3 ­ is a good replacement for your iPod. On the battery front, you get the same day's worth of use like you would on the OnePlus handset before needing a fast charge.. LG V30+ (18:9 OLED FullVisionTM, 128GB) - Black ₹ 44990. Like the other devices reviewed here, the Coolpad Max is an all-metal handset fronted by a scratch-resistant display. Interestingly, its navigation controls are only accessible via the user interface, so you won't get a physical button or capacitive controls on this one. Its display is capable of sharp images and text, however, colours appear to be slightly bumped up. That said, it is legible even when outdoors. The Coolpad Max runs CoolUI, a heavily customized version of Android Lollipop, which takes some time getting used to. Its thematic skins even change the look of common icons. There's Dual Space, which lets you keep your personal photos and documents separate from your work-related ones. And a floating “C-Button", which gives you quick access to common actions like screenshot, shutdown, brightness, volume, etc. Plus, its fingerprint sensor can be used to assign each print to take a picture, launch an app or swap spaces. Its customization doesn't lead to slowdowns during light usage, but it eats into the 4GB memory while switching between resource-intensive apps. Its processor is not top-of-the-line, but good enough for casual gaming and productivity tasks. The Max's rear camera captures sharp, detailed images with excellent depth of field in well-lit settings. Low-light shots are evenly illuminated, albeit with slight softening, but are still worthy of sharing online. However, focusing tends to be a hit-and-miss affair when shooting against a bright background. Its front camera's output is rather underwhelming, and even its selfie mode does little to improve its captures. Call quality and its speaker are loud and clear, while music via earphones sounds quite average. Audio, even with optimization enabled, lacks the punch that we've experienced in other devices reviewed here. The Coolpad Max scored the lowest in the battery tests. However, with its power management feature, you can expect to eke out a day without having to recharge. Fast-charging comes standard; you just need an hour to replenish the battery..
