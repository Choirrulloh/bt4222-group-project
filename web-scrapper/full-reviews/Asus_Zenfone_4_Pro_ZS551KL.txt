This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. In the notebook sector, Asus had a global market share of about 11% from 2014-2016, making it the fourth largest laptop manufacturer. In the smartphone sector, Asus is not among the Top 5 and has only a small market share (as of 2016).. Similar devices from a different Manufacturer. Samsung Galaxy S8 Active Adreno 540.

ASUS ZenFone 4 Pro （ZS551KL）開箱、評測、評價 華碩最好的拍照旗艦手機. ASUS ZenFone 4 Pro 開箱與外觀 ASUS ZenFone 4 Pro UI ASUS ZenFone 4 Pro 效能測試 ASUS ZenFone 4 Pro 拍照錄影效果 結論. 這次為大家介紹的是 ASUS ZenFone 4 Pro （ZS551KL） 開箱評測，相信最近大家應該經常被華碩與代言人孔劉的 ZenFone 4 廣告吸引目光吧？除了代言人超帥以外 ZenFone 4 這次不論在產品、規格、價格方面都相當吸引人也是主因。不過以產品定位來說，ZenFone 4 只能算系列中裡面的中階機，華碩 2017 真正的年度旗艦款其實是今天要介紹的 ASUS ZenFone 4 Pro （ZS551KL），他一口氣搭載了當前最高 S835 處理器、雙鏡頭相機組合與 6 GB RAM 記憶體的旗艦規格，也可看出華碩要在高階市場攻城掠地的決心，接下來阿達為您詳細介紹 ZenFone 4. ZenFone 4 Pro 是 ZenFone 4 系列五款機型中 以規格來看是真正意義上的旗艦機，地位與去年的 ZenFone 3 Deluxe 一樣，身負該系列高階旗艦機銷售的重責大任。在外盒設計上與 ZenFone 4 一樣走低調陳穩風格，除了產品名稱以外，另外就是由 ZenFone 4 Pro 所組成的「We Love Photo」LOGO：. ZenFone 4 Pro 採用的是華碩自家 BoostMaster 快充技術，可進行最高 9V/2A 18W 的高速充電，充電五分鐘即可通話長達兩小時：. ZenFone 4 Pro 搭載 5.5 吋 1920×1080 Full HD 解析度 Super AMOLED 螢幕（亮度 500nits；100％NTSC色域），在螢幕上方覆蓋了一層 2.5D 康寧 Gorilla 大金剛玻璃，在漂亮的顯色下也有令人放心的防護效果：. 螢幕上方的前鏡頭搭載的是 F/1.9 大光圈 800 萬畫素 Sony IMX319 感光元件鏡頭，每個像素尺寸高達 1.4μm（廣角 87.4度），與同時立體聲喇叭功能的聽筒，與底部的立體聲喇叭營造出雙立體聲揚聲器的效果：. ZenFone 4 Pro 機身的採用先進的奈米成型技術（NMT）打造出一體成型鋁合金材質中框，厚度僅有 7.9 mm，並採亮面處理、中框上/下緣另外使用了 CNC 鑽石切邊工法，與正反面的玻璃完美結合，手感相當圓潤：. 機身下緣則是有 3.5mm 耳機孔、TYPE-C 連接埠（支援 9V/2A 快充）、收音麥克風與立體聲喇叭：. ZenFone 4 Pro 採用標準三選二的 SIM 卡插槽配置，支援台灣 4G LTE 全頻，支援 4G+3G 雙卡雙待與 3CA 高速上網能力（CAT 12；最高 600Mbps 下載速度）以及 MIMO 無線高速傳輸功能，最大記憶卡容量支援到 2TB：. ZenFone 4 Pro 背面一樣搭載 Gorilla 大金剛玻璃，質感非常優異（但也難逃沾指紋的命運，只好經常擦拭了），在台灣初期共有純粹黑與月光白兩色，阿達這次拿到的是純粹黑版本：. ZenFone 4 Pro 的口號是「We Love Photo」，所以「照相」這檔事當然是 ZenFone 4 Pro 最重視的功能了，他的主相機（左）採用了 F/1.7 大光圈 1200 萬畫素 Sony IMX362 感光元件，具備 4 軸 4 級光學防手震與 3 軸電子防手震功能。而第二顆兩倍光學變焦鏡頭則是採用了 1600 萬畫素 Sony IMX351 感光元件，加上 RGB 色彩感應器與 Dual Pixel 自動相位對焦 (PDAF) 系統、雷射自動對焦系統與持續自動對焦系統的三混對焦功能結合，形成了強大的照相組合：. ZenFone 4 Pro 5.5 吋機身尺寸（75.6×156.9×7.6 mm）加上圓潤設計的機身，讓使用者單手握持、操控都沒有問題：. ZenFone 4 Pro 搭載最新版的 ZenUI 4.0 與 Android 7.1.1 系統（將來可更新到 Android 8.0），介面延續著華碩目前幾乎什麼都事先內建好的優良傳統：. ZenFone 4 Pro 原生就搭載 6GB RAM ，運行程式相當的流暢，內存部分則有 64 GB ROM，預設可用空間都有 52.39 GB 以上，搭配記憶卡使用不會有空間不夠用的問題：. ZenFone 4 Pro 這次加入了 Always-on Panel 功能，也就是在螢幕休眠的情況下，系統會以最省電的方式顯示當前時間與訊息。由於 ZenFone 4 Pro 採用了 AMOLED 面板，所以顯示的位置也會自動變化以免造成烙痕：. ASUS 個人化設定裡面提供了應用分身、Page Marker、遊戲精靈等功能，這部分阿達在之前的 ZenFone 4 開箱 中已經詳細介紹過了，不浪費篇幅說明：. ZenFone 4 Pro 支援 NFC 行動支付，只要設定 Android Pay 就能在全國的感應式信用卡配合商店消費刷卡：. ZenUI 4.0 內建了「ZenUI 防身保鑣」，可定時通報座標與 SOS 求助訊號，在緊急情況下，就算不點亮螢幕也一樣可以播出求救電話給指定的門號，不論老人、小孩、經常夜歸的婦女都很需要這個功能：. ZenFone 4 Pro 搭載當前最高等級的 Qualcomm Snapdragon. 835 八核心 64 位元處理器、LPDDR4x 6GB RAM、UFS2.1 64 GB ROM 等硬體規格，在效能表現方面自然不在話下，表現的相當好：. 安兔兔與 GFXBench 的表現都相當不錯的表現，安兔兔總分高達 17.5萬分，是今年測出表現最好的旗艦機。而 GFXBench 項目在霸王龍離屏項目更是逼進 120 FPS：. 3D MARK 的表現，使用 ZenFone 4 Pro 不論是玩遊戲、或進行任何工作都是相當的流暢：. ZenFone 4 Pro 搭載 3600 mAh 大容量電池，以 PCMARK 模擬日常上網、修圖、文書處理等應用，由 100% 到 20% 共使用了 9 小時 40 分，預估至少有 11.5 小時的續航能力。正常使用一整天不用充電應該沒問題，且 ZenFone 4 Pro 具備 BoostMaster 極速充電能力，回充速度很快，而且待機相當省電，一般日常使用相當愉快：. ZenFone 4 Pro 主鏡頭使用了 1200萬畫素 Sony IMX362 感光元件，具有 F/1.7大光圈（焦段 25mm）、三混對焦的拍攝能力。另一顆變焦鏡頭則是使用了 1600 萬像素 Sony IMX351 感光元件，由於焦段為 50 mm，所以剛好具備主鏡頭 2 倍光學變焦能力，在配置上與 ZenFone 3 Zoom 類似：. 在拍攝介面上下滑動可切換攝影模式或濾鏡，不過 ZenFone 4 系列的攝影模式比起之前幾代的 ZenFone 更精煉、使用更直覺：. 最高拍照解析度為 1200 萬畫素，錄影最高為 4K UHD 畫質（3840×2160）：. 以下是使用 ASUS ZenFone 4 Pro 以自動模式、自動 HDR 所拍攝， 原始大圖請點我 ，首先是日間攝影：. 以下是使用 ASUS ZenFone 4 Pro 所拍攝的人像模式照片：. ZenFone 4 Pro 的拍照表現是阿達覺得這兩年來所測試華碩所有手機中畫質表現最銳利的一款，在照片成品細節表現的很好，不過顏色表現個人覺得有點偏豔（但很討喜，應該是 AUTO HDR 所致），八倍微光夜拍的品質也是華碩所有手機中表現最好的，可見的這次在相機調教上的確下了苦工，整體而言讓「We Love Photo」這句口號是「名符其實」的。. ASUS ZenFone 4 Pro 擁有當前最高等級的 Qualcomm Snapdragon S835處理器、6GB RAM、64GB ROM、F1.7大光圈雙鏡頭相機、在規格與功能等各方面都擁有旗艦級表現，加上 599 美金（約18000元台幣）也是目前所有品牌中 C/P 值最高的 S835 規格旗艦機。. 教你如何ROOT Asus ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro (ZD552KL).
