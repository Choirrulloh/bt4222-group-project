The Nokia 3310 3G looks and feels like a 2005-era phone, which doesn't take advantage of 2017's voice technologies.. There are a lot of people who could do with stepping back from their perpetual smartphone obsessions. Many of us would like to dial back to a day when you actually had to pay attention to the world around you. According to Pew , 18 percent of mobile-phone users in the US are still on feature phones, whether it's because they don't want to deal with smartphone features, or they don't want to pay for them. The $60 Nokia 3310 3G is an affordable, good-looking, unlocked phone for those looking for simple voice service. I just wish it had better network coverage, and bent just a bit more to the needs of 2017 society.. The Nokia 3310 3G is an attractive, pastel-colored lozenge that comes in blue, gray, red, or yellow. It measures 4.6 by 2.1 by 0.5 inches (HWD) and weighs a light 3.1 ounces The silver plastic buttons are clicky, if cheap-feeling. The top half of the phone is a somewhat dim 320-by-240 color TFT LCD screen. The speakerphone, camera, and flashlight are on the back panel. It isn't water-resistant, but by virtue of being a very simple phone with a plastic screen, it'll likely handle minor drops without a problem.. There are several, physically identical versions of the 3310 being sold. Some of them don't support US networks. The one you need is model TA-1036. I might as well also mention that this phone has some sort of cult nostalgia thing going in Europe, where the original 3310 was spectacularly popular in the early 2000s. The original 3310 was never released in the US, although a variant, the 3390, had limited success on AT&T and T-Mobile in 2003.. View All 8 Photos in Gallery. As a voice phone, reception and voice quality here are key. The 3310 fares well on voice quality, but it really falls down on coverage and network compatibility.. Voice quality on the AT&T network is loud, but harsh, without the roundedness you get in phones that support HD Voice. Still, though, I'd rate it better than the 2G Blu voice phones we've tested. The speakerphone isn't terribly loud; I wouldn't use it outside. But the volume and sound quality are fine indoors on a table, or in a quiet car. There's some background noise cancellation, although it isn't as complete as top-of-the-line smartphones.. Battery life, at 6 hours, 16 minutes of talk time, is less than I'd like. But the phone has days if not weeks of standby time, because there aren't a lot of background processes chewing up battery.. See How We Test Cell Phones. If you're going to connect to US cellular networks in 2017, and especially in 2019, you really need LTE, and the 3310 doesn't support it. The phone works on the 850/1900MHz 2G and 3G GSM bands. I couldn't figure out what variety of HSPA data it uses, except that it isn't particularly fast. Still, though, it's quite a lot faster than a 2G EDGE phone would be.. The 3310 doesn't work on Sprint or Verizon at all. On T-Mobile, it's only compatible with the sliver of a 1900MHz 2G network the carrier has left around for Internet-of-things gadgets. I found that T-Mobile coverage dropped anywhere inside our office building. The 3310 has better AT&T coverage on AT&T's 3G 850/1900 network. But there, too, AT&T has started to slowly cannibalize its older network for 4G.. Your best bet is to pair the 3310 with a low-cost carrier that uses the AT&T network. Red Pocket's $10, 500-minute plan fits the bill nicely, for instance, and there's no commitment, so if AT&T decides to reduce its 3G coverage, you aren't stuck.. The phone's lack of Wi-Fi also hurts its voice capabilities. All the US carriers now have some kind of Wi-Fi calling solution, but you won't get it here.. The Bluetooth 2.1 is noticeably lower quality than on smartphones with Bluetooth 4.0 or higher. The phone wouldn't pair with my Plantronics Voyager Focus UC stereo headset, although it worked with a Voyager 5200 single-ear headset. But the connection to the 5200 was plagued by irritating pops and clicks, which I didn't experience with smartphones with Bluetooth 5.0.. I'd rather use a wired headset here, which also has the advantage of activating the 3310's built-in FM radio.. The 3310's Java-based Series 30+ interface has some of the standard old-phone apps. There's a calendar and contact book, a basic music player, a basic video player, and Opera Mini as its Web browser. You can download and run Java-based apps and games if you get hold of them, and you can access mobile Web sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail through Opera Mini. The phone comes with a few games, and they run sluggishly. I was deeply disappointed in the nouveau version of Snake, which 'upgrades' graphics and gameplay to look more like slither.io. The contact book has an intriguing feature which lets it sync contacts with an Android phone over Bluetooth, but it creates a huge number of duplicate contacts as each phone number becomes a new contact. Still, that's better than typing them all in. The calendar doesn't sync with anything and is rather useless.. With only 64MB of the built-in 128MB storage free, you'll want to add a microSD card, which fits in a slot under the battery. Don't use one bigger than 32GB, it won't work (we tried). The music player will gather together MP3, WAV, and M4A files from the memory card, but not OGG or FLAC. The video player handles old-school MPEG4 AVI files at up to VGA resolution, but don't try decoding H.264.. To get files on or off the phone, you can send them via Bluetooth, or use a standard micro USB cable and mass storage mode.. The phone's 2-megapixel camera feels like a lie. While it snaps photos quickly, the images are covered in hideous artifacts that look like they were upscaled or altered. The phone records 352-by-288 videos whose jerky quality harkens back to the previous decade.. You can use one of 12 tinny ringtones or your own MP3, but you can't assign ringtones by person or by group. The phone supports SMS and MMS, but not emoji (they just appear as boxes). Predictive text is not turned on by default, and it's oddly hidden in the settings: You have to go into the Settings menu and press the left function key, which isn't labeled, to activate it.. The Nokia 3310 is the cutest little voice phone we've seen this year. As long as you stick with AT&T, its feature set is on par with other cheap voice phones such as the Doro PhoneEasy 626 and the LG B470, although the B470 has an extra-loud mode and a text-to-speech function which seniors may like. Because the 3310 costs under $60 unlocked, it pairs well with cheap virtual-operator plans on the AT&T network, like Red Pocket's plans.. But I'm still disappointed because in a 2017 voice phone, I'd like to see a phone that excels in voice calls. I want to see a phone that takes advantage of features like VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling for the best possible reception, has current Bluetooth for clear connections, and receives the emoji that younger family members may want to send you. Because the kids don't call any more: They text you little pictures of pigs.. I don't think that phone exists, alas. Soon, we're going to check out the Alcatel Go Flip series, which works with T-Mobile's and Sprint's growing 4G LTE networks. It may point the way toward the future, rather than just acting like a phone from the past.. Bottom Line: The Nokia 3310 3G looks and feels like a 2005-era phone, which doesn't take advantage of 2017's voice technologies..

There was an error emailing this page.. No, tiny keypads aren't becoming cool again. Nokia goes retro again with the 8110, but who's really going to buy it?. Nokia now has three budget Android phones, but everyone will want the 3310.... Samsung Galaxy S9: Dual Aperture camera test. [ Further reading: The best Ultra-HD Blu-ray players ] Stephen Lawson. If you long for a time when our phones didn’t scan our faces or cost $1,000 , there’s a new handset coming for you. HMD Global has launched another new Nokia 3310 , and this one brings 3G speeds and a 27-day battery. And it’s coming to the U.S.. When Nokia showed off its 3310 reboot at Mobile World Congress earlier this year, it instantly created buzz. Not only was our favorite candy bar handset from the 2000s back, it also brought an updated design with a 2.4-inch screen, a removable battery, and a MicroSD slot. It didn’t have a touch screen. It didn’t run Android like the other Nokia phones. And, most importantly, it was tied to 2G networks, which meant U.S. That’s changed with the upcoming Nokia 3310 3G. Not only will it bring high(er)-speed Internet access, it will also be able to make calls on U.S. HMD says it will be launching the Nokia 3310 3G in the U.S. but hasn’t given a time frame for release yet. An HMD representative told me information would be available “in the coming weeks.”. We do know that the handset will be an Australian exclusive at first, where it will cost $90. HMD has also confirmed that the international Nokia 3310 will cost 69 Euros, which works out to around $80.. The Nokia 3310 looks cute and all, but it doesn’t do much.. However, even for such a low price, the U.S.-bound Nokia 3310 doesn’t offer much beyond nostalgia. It still runs the Nokia Series 30+ operating system (which now has a customizable UI), but most people would rather have an Android fork. Plus, it only has a 2MP camera and only features a small handful of apps. And it doesn’t have a touch screen or Wi-Fi. It does, however, come in blue, yellow, red, and charcoal, and includes an upgraded version of the classic Snake game. For comparison, the Jelly phone has the same 2.4-inch screen but also brings a full version of Android Nougat, 4G networking, an 8MP camera, and GPS. The Nokia 3310 is cute and kitschy, but I can’t imagine many people actually buying one—or loving the one they’ve purchased.. Nor do we know whether it’ll be sold through any of the major U.S. Even with Nokia’s branding, HMD has struggled to make inroads in the U.S. The Nokia 6 is the only HMD Global handset on sale in the U.S., but it’s only available through Amazon , and only. At $180 (with lock screen ads) it’s only $100 more than the Nokia 3310 price tag, and you get a full-featured smartphone running Android 7.1.. During the introduction, HMD Global chief marketing officer Pekka Rantala said the Nokia 3310 will appeal to people who want “a summer phone... an object of desire.” This seems like an awfully small niche, but I get what he’s saying.. The Nokia 3310 could appeal to smartphone users who want a limited phone to take on vacation, or to parents who want their kids to be able to call them. But even then, it’s probably not worth it. Most of the carriers have already begun to transition to 4G LTE exclusively, and there’s no telling how much longer 3G networks will be reliable. And like the Nokia 6, it’s unlikely to work on the Verizon or Sprint spectrum.. So, while the Nokia 3310 may be cute and cheap, even at $80, it’s hardly a bargain. But, hey, if you really want to play Snake using hardware keys, then it’s probably the phone of your dreams..

"The Nokia 3310, with 3G connectivity, makes it even easier to keep in touch with everyone, while still enjoying the retro mobile experience. The phone also features a colour display and the nostalgic Snake game.". Available in Blue, Grey, Red and Yellow. “The long awaited Nokia 3310 is back, and now with 3G connectivity. Up to 6 hrs 30 minutes talktime. The 2017 version of the Nokia 3310 has truly been brought into the digital age with 3G connectivity. It strongly resembles the original in terms of design, with its T9 keypad layout, but it’s now slimmer and has a larger 2.4-inch colour display.. A 25-day standby battery life is great news if you’re looking for a phone to keep you going all the way through your weekend away. You’ll also get around 50 hours of music playback, or 22 hours talk time on a single charge.. Snake is hands-down everyone’s favourite retro mobile game. It’s seen a slight redesign, now with a more arcade look and feel. And you can now move in more than four directions.. 117 x 52.4 x 13.4 mm. Nokia 3310 3G Reviews - page 2. Nokia 3310 3G is rated. Rated 1 out of. Can only have singular numbers for one person. e.g cannot under a name store mobile, work and home number.. Though fitted with Bluetooth is severely limited in its ability. Unable to transfer to car's phone book.. Unfortunately is a present from Uk and can only bin it.. Rated 1 out of. Have had the phone for 2 months used every day for work good battery life , but am sick of this phone pocket dialing 999 or my answers phone even when locked ! So it spends more time switched off , than on. No good as a work phone if like me you work out doors. Rated 2 out of. Returned 3g version for 2g version. I bought this 3310 3g but my problem with it was the small text size that could not be increased. I also didn't like the operating system.. I returned this phone next day and I bought 3310 2g version and it is great for me. Easy operating system and adjustable text size. Nokia should have just put 3g into the 3310 without changing the Nokia series 30+ operating system.. Rated 3 out of. Text small so need to put on reading glasses to read or send however apart from that ok. That was one of the things I liked about the doro 6520-I could read and send texts without needing my reading glasses.I have long sight and reading glasses so it is good if I can read texts with the latter and not have to change my glasses. Can hear the text arrived sound when phone in my pocket. If you find cheper deal than ours,We'll match it and pay your first monthly bill..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Stress free. I'm a 20 year old that bought this phone because I'm actually really tired of my smart phone (Samsung s8) people look at me like I'm crazy when I show them my phone, but to be honest I've never felt so free. I don't have to worry about that dumb Instagram message or check what my friends are doing 24/7 on facebook. Like I'm soooo tired of spending so many hours doing nothing on my smartphone. I have a tablet and computer to do the job for me. I'm just really happy with this phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars This phone is horrible and wonderful at the same time. This phone is horrible and wonderful at the same time. If you are switching from a smartphone, you will IMMEDIATELY feel the pain in every respect. It's just like the old days. If you are looking to cure your smartphone addiction, this is the key. It takes at least a week for the frustration to subside. You'll be OK and better off in the long run without the constant access to everything everywhere all the time. Works fine for me with T-Mobile. People with SIM issues having a problem with it not fitting right may be using the wrong size card or adapter. I had zero problems, fits perfectly. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Works great! iPhone sits in the drawer now!. First things first: Buy a mini SIM adapter if you are a T Mobile customer! There are many SIM kits out there and they are cheap! The only issue I had was putting in the SIM card. It was arduous and your manicurist is not going to be happy! When the SIM is installed, you are in for a treat! I never thought I would say this: I have made my iPhone the spare phone and this Nokia as my main phone (I love SIM). The call quality is excellent for 3G. This phone is very easy to use. It connected flawlessly to my Bluetooth speaker phone in my car. One of the best phones I have ever owned! (Now, if Lenovo/Motorola could bring back their Tac series of cell phones...). Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Addressing inaccurate reviews. Color: Warm Red | Verified Purchase. If you need e-mail, FAST texting, HIGH speed internet, traditional apps, GPS, a good camera, Wi-Fi, 4g LTE or anything similar, this is not the phone for you. For most this is not going to be your primary phone. Now that we are past that I’ve seen some misinformation in the reviews. Below are my responses to the incorrect information I’ve seen. *The review photo shows the location of the quick settings button.* - The volume can be quickly adjusted with a single key press. Use the quick settings key and it can be adjusted quickly. Some folks have stated they must go through the settings menu which is inaccurate. - The phone does have predictive text. Just as the volume above simply hold down the quick settings key. You can also turn this on from the text message menu. A review stated that it was unavailable. - The phone does have silent. Simply push the quick settings key. You will find the option to silence the phone. A couple reviews said the opposite. - You must use the correct SIM card size which is a micro SIM card. Do not attempt to use a nano SIM card. I’ve seen that cell phone stores installed the nano sim and blamed the phone for not working. - You need to check with your carrier to ensure you’ll will have the network you need for the phone. Alternatively you can use Open Signal to verify 2g/3g in your area. - The T9 texting is definitely a learning curve. The first letter of your sentence will capitalize automatically. (a review said it didn’t) Simply push the quick settings button during your text. You can switch from lower case, all caps, first letter caps and numbers. - The manual indicates that a double SIM card version and a single SIM card version exists. HOWEVER Amazon and other sellers are not clear at all to which one they sell. Nokia hasn’t been clear on how to tell which one is it either. (The phone I bought directly from Amazon was a single SIM card) I recommend you fully read the manual from the Nokia website. I took 10 mins to do that and it made a world of difference. This phone is for: Evening phone Something to take to places high risk to your smart phone (water park, festivals) Social media/digital cleanse Very young children or senior citizens that have trouble with smart phones Emergency phone A spare phone when your smart phone battery runs out I’m using this to take a break from social media and the news. I also use my iPhone 6s Plus still and that will not change. There are many more positives and negatives to this phone. I have purposely chose to not include that in my review. I wanted to focus more on inaccuracies and uses. As there seemed to be some misinformation in other reviews.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars A new twist on classic phones: This one is pretty good!. It's good phone, feels very smooth in the hand! The OS is surprisingly slick and it supports threaded text messaging. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Poor call qualify, junk cluttering up menus.. This is mostly as advertised, and the call quality is good, which was my main concern. BUT there's a ton of unremoveable bloatware cluttering up the menus. Facebook, Twitter, some stupid looking Disney game, things like that. Lots of people who want one, including the person I got this for, don't want that junk on their phones, so it was a nasty surprise to see all that crap. UPDATE: Well, the call quality was good the first day or two, but that was apparently an anomaly. We have other phones on the same plan, and they work fine, so it's not the service itself. It's not dropping calls, but it gets really really staticky and difficult to hear.. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars I bought the phone to take on my travel in .... Color: Warm Red | Verified Purchase. I bought the phone to take on my travel in Asia. The 2 SIM card arrangement was the biggest draw for me. I opened the phone to insert the battery and so there was only one slot for SIM card not two. That was a big let down. Even the instructions had two SIM card slots showing. Anyway, I guess I just have to switch SIM cards wherever I go.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars A Modern twist on an old school phone. You get what you paid for--and for around $60, this is a great phone. I mostly bought this phone for nostalgia, but when my iPhone started having some software bugs involving the SIM card not being detected, I decided to use this phone while waiting for the iPhone software to be updated. This phone is simple, old school, and works great for making calls and short texts. The only issue I have with this phone is that certain numbers can bypass the locked keypad (e.g. I get the point, in an emergency, you'd want to be able to dial a number quickly, but the odds of the numbers being dialed by mistake while in your pocket is worrisome--it would be nice to be able to disable this feature to guarantee that the phone doesn't butt dial emergency services. Was this review helpful to you?. How is a phone this crappy and simple slow and laggy. 2.0 out of 5 stars Slow, laggy.. If I could, I would have reviewed at 4.5 stars. I mostly use it for snake, text messaging, and phone calls. 4.0 out of 5 stars I love my Nokia 3310. While this retro 3310 is more of a PR stunt for the new Nokia than anything else, it is a remarkable good feature phone. 4.0 out of 5 stars it is a remarkable good feature phone. good~!

Auto-suggest helps you quickly narrow down your search results by suggesting possible matches as you type.. Float this Topic for Current User. The Nokia 3310 3G was released today, October 29. I am attempting to set up service for it and order a SIM card. When I called customer support the IMEI number is showing up as a 2G phone in the AT&T system.

You’re in for a doozy of a throwback with the Nokia 3310 3G .. 3310, if you don’t recall, was a “dumb” phone that launched in 2000. Like most Nokia phones at the time, its long-lasting battery and tank-like durability set it apart.. So when can you buy one and how much will it cost? Here’s everything you need to know about the Nokia 3310 3G.. In a market brimming with $900+ smartphones , the Nokia 3310 3G is a real bargain..

Note, though, that the European variant of the phone only supports GSM 900MHz and 1800MHz bands, which means it isn’t really configured for U.S. If you want stateside service, you’ll have to stick with the U.S. In all territories where it’s available, the Nokia 3310 3G comes in red, dark blue, yellow, and gray colors.. Nokia isn’t in the business of making phones anymore, smart or dumb — it licensed its brand name to HMD Global, a Chinese holding company, years ago. But it retains control over the design, software, and marketing of phones carrying its brand. Basically, HMD has to make sure its phones are in keeping with Nokia’s standards.. It’s plastic, like the Nokia Lumia series for Windows Mobile, almost to the point that it looks and feels like a toy. But it’s also incredibly light, compact, rounded, and anything but fragile.. 1139654 autosave v1 2 nokia3310 mwc 4. The Nokia 3310 doesn’t have at QWERTY keyboard (you’ll have to brush up on your T9 typing ), and the 2-megapixel rear camera and 2.4-inch QVGA display don’t leave much room for the battery. Still, Nokia claims the 1,200mAh removable cell, which charges via Micro USB port, lasts up to 27 days on standby and up to 6.5 hours of talk time.. In terms of storage, the 3310 3G has a MicroSD card slot that support cards up to 32GB in size. And besides 3G, it’s equipped with Bluetooth SLAM, Nokia’s proprietary pairing standard, and an FM radio.. It runs on the Nokia Series 30+ operating system instead, which ships with a basic bundle of apps. There’s an MP3 player app in case you want to listen to some music, and a few games (including. Snake ) that will hold your attention for short commutes.. The 3310 3G won’t won’t replace your smartphone — it can’t. But as a burner phone, a backup, or a fun novelty, you could do worse..

Nokia has decided to bump up the specification and includes 3G connectivity.. Keeping the same design and simplistic interface, the added connectivity option allows for a few more modern features. Now you can much more quickly access email, as well as basic text updates for social feeds including Twitter and Facebook.. The inclusion of 3G also allows the new 3310 to be used in areas and regions where 2G support has been turned off, or with network providers that no longer offer a 2G/GSM service.. The Nokia 3310 3G is available from Clove Technology SIM Free and factory unlocked; ready to work on all compatible UK and European networks.. Please Note - The Nokia 3310 3G sold at Clove Technology is a dual-band (900 / 2100) 3G device. This is compatible across the EMEA region and much of the Asia/Pacific & South American regions. Compatibility in North America is limited. Please refer to the World Time Zone GSM Map for more information.. The Nokia 3310 3G is being manufactured in Warm Red, Azure Blue, Yellow and Charcoal Grey.. The phone includes 64MB of storage for contacts and messages and supports the use of Micro SD cards up to 32GB (sold separately) for media (music, images, video etc.). A legend returns! The original Nokia 3310 was launched in 2000, at a time when 'smartphones' didn't even really exist. Clove Technology did though! We didn't really sell mobile phones back then, but we were happily providing PDAs and other niche technology to business customers.. That said I expect some of the Clove staff from the early 2000's would have had a 3310 in their pockets. Some of the current staff definitely had them at school!. The original Nokia 3310 is a shining example of a simpler time in consumer technology. Week-long battery life, monochrome screens, and polyphonic ringtones (who could forget Bomfunk MC's Freestyler...?).. The 2000's Nokia 3310 did everything you could possibly want back then. Plus it would even survive a drop or two down the stairs too!. With this redesign, Nokia is catching a wave of fashionable nostalgia among millennials. If you want to decouple your online life from day-to-day activity, returning to a simpler handset may be helpful.. Aside from the full-colour screen and slimmer construction, this is as close to a basic feature phone as you can get.. The phone runs a proprietary Nokia Series 30&plus; operating system. Cellular connection is available on 2G GSM (voice and text) and 3G if enabled.. Having 3G data lets you connect using operators that no longer provide a 2G GSM service (some are now switching this off, with the newest operators having never offered it), as well as in areas without 2G coverage. With a 3G connection, you can make calls, store contacts and send SMS / MMS.. The 3G connection still allows for calls & texts, as well as providing a data capability for larger packet information such as emails and web browsing. Of course the small screen is not designed for full web browsing, however, you will be able to access basic websites through the Java browser, as well as access simplified text feeds for popular social services such as Facebook and Twitter.. A basic calendar, calculator and other simple organisation tools are available, but aside from these, there is no storefront to add more apps to the phone. The available social feeds (Facebook / Twitter) are baked directly into the proprietary Operating System and not designed to be modified, updated or added to.. As for media, there is a simple 2-megapixel fixed-focus camera. With a steady hand you can still take and send a decent full-colour image but it may not be profile picture worthy.. The internal storage is only designed for holding contacts and messages. You can expand this with, up to, 32GB micro SD cards if you want to store several images or music. There is a built-in MP3 player should you spend the time ripping tracks to copy across. An FM radio is also built-in too.. 2017's Nokia 3310 3G is available in 4 colour options. Oh, and you can play a modern version of Snake too!. Functions A2DP / HFP / HSP / OPP / PBAP / SLAM (P2P sharing). Hardware Buttons Volume / 4-way navigation key / Call key / Power key. Flash Fixed focus with LED flash. Dimensions 117 x 52.4 x 13.4 mm. Software WAP 2.0/xHTML (over EDGE 2.5G data connections), Audio / Video player,.

I would say 4-days is typical, (based on the 4-band variant TA-1036 with a SIM & 32GB flash card in it), when in my backpack skiing - it was more like 2-days. When you see the size of the battery - this is not too surprising. Maybe there is scope for HMD (or a 3-party), to come up a much thicker battery, and a deeper rear cover to accommodate it ?. I have a 3310 3G,am hard of hearing.The max volume is 9 which is too low for me.Can the hand set hearing volume be increased?. Aadrian, 30 Sep 2017 Bad that the covers are not exchangeable with the other 3310, cause it looks different. more How many total contacts can you save on it? Can you save multiple numbers with a single entry/name?. So I bought this in November 2017. And guess what?! After 3 months, it is acting up weird. One moment all keys do not function and another time it keeps doing things without touching it like, flashlight turning on or dialling random numbers. I can't believe it will have issues as such. I already hard reset or factory setting reset it and it still acts up from time to time. Elyas, 23 Jan 2018 Is it possible to make internet calls? whatsapp viber telegram whatever...

Unlike older Nokia feature phones (e.g. C1-02), the 3310 3G has no Bluetooth modem profile, so it's not possible to use it as a modem to connect a laptop or other device to the Internet (very handy feature, in some situations). It also looks like there is an error in the technical info (which seem to be widespread online). The dual SIM model (aka TA-1006) is NOT quad-band! There are two single-SIM models (TA-1022 and TA-1036), and the latter is quad-band.

Great for the fact that you can put more than one number under a name. However why dies it unlock to the menu and not the main screen. Why does Nokia change that? Also the d pad doesn't have any use in the main screen. Anyone know hw to change this?. Not sure why they had to change series 30+. Personally i think they should bring back s40 and you might find whatsapp will continue support. With talk of the 4g version using a different os will this see any update?

Charcoal, Warm Red, Yellow, and Azure.. One of the most important updates to the Nokia 3310 is that it now supports American 3G networks. The previous version would only pick up in 2G networks, if at all. This limited data speeds and network availability. While 3G won’t be around forever, it does work now and allows the web browser. built into the phone to load with halfway decent speeds.. In addition to updating the phone to offer 3G, Nokia has also added customization options like changing the icon colors and positions. And yes, it still has snake! Hit the button below to reserve yours.. Original coverage (9/29/17) : Before anyone starts asking in the comments; yes, we know the Nokia 3310 is not an Android phone. However, we still think that HMD Global was very smart to relaunch a new version of this classic mobile handset alongside its other Android Nokia-branded smartphones and we cannot resist writing about it. Many people still have a lot of warm feelings for the original Nokia 3310, and the new edition that was first announced in February at MWC 2017 is an almost perfect replica of that older mobile phone.. This week, HMD Global announced that it would launch yet another version of the Nokia 3310. In addition to being slightly bigger, the new version will have one important addition inside; 3G cellular hardware. That means this version can be used on some US carriers; specifically GSM networks like T-Mobile and AT&T (sorry, Verizon and Sprint users). Because of the new hardware, owners will get up to. 6.5 hours of talk time on a single charge when it is being used on a 3G network, well below the 22 hours for the previous 2G edition.. The newest edition of the Nokia 3310 will also get some changes in its user interface, so owners can change the icon colors and positions (don’t worry, it’s still able to play Snake ). Yellow and Warm Red colors, the phone will be sold in. Azure and Charcoal color options, along with. silver keypads with buttons that have been given more space between each other, so owners can have a better dialing and texting experience.. The 3G edition of the Nokia 3310 will go on sale in mid-October for the price of. There’s no word on if any US carriers will sell the phone, but we would bet that lots of folks in this country would love to get their hands on it for a piece of nostalgia..

The Nokia 3310 3G looks and feels like a 2005-era phone, which doesn't take advantage of 2017's voice technologies.. Editor Rating: Good (3.0) Nov 14, 2017. Lacks T9 predictive text input and emoji. The Nokia 3310 3G looks and feels like a 2005-era phone, which doesn't take advantage of 2017's voice technologies.. There are a lot of people who could do with stepping back from their perpetual smartphone obsessions. Many of us would like to dial back to a day when you actually had to pay attention to the world around you. According to Pew , 18 percent of mobile-phone users in the US are still on feature phones, whether it's because they don't want to deal with smartphone features, or they don't want to pay for them. The $60 Nokia 3310 3G is an affordable, good-looking, unlocked phone for those looking for simple voice service. I just wish it had better network coverage, and bent just a bit more to the needs of 2017 society.. The Nokia 3310 3G is an attractive, pastel-colored lozenge that comes in blue, gray, red, or yellow. It measures 4.6 by 2.1 by 0.5 inches (HWD) and weighs a light 3.1 ounces The silver plastic buttons are clicky, if cheap-feeling. The top half of the phone is a somewhat dim 320-by-240 color TFT LCD screen. The speakerphone, camera, and flashlight are on the back panel. It isn't water-resistant, but by virtue of being a very simple phone with a plastic screen, it'll likely handle minor drops without a problem.. There are several, physically identical versions of the 3310 being sold. Some of them don't support US networks. The one you need is model TA-1036. I might as well also mention that this phone has some sort of cult nostalgia thing going in Europe, where the original 3310 was spectacularly popular in the early 2000s. The original 3310 was never released in the US, although a variant, the 3390, had limited success on AT&T and T-Mobile in 2003.. View All 8 Photos in Gallery. As a voice phone, reception and voice quality here are key. The 3310 fares well on voice quality, but it really falls down on coverage and network compatibility.. Voice quality on the AT&T network is loud, but harsh, without the roundedness you get in phones that support HD Voice. Still, though, I'd rate it better than the 2G Blu voice phones we've tested. The speakerphone isn't terribly loud; I wouldn't use it outside. But the volume and sound quality are fine indoors on a table, or in a quiet car. There's some background noise cancellation, although it isn't as complete as top-of-the-line smartphones.. Battery life, at 6 hours, 16 minutes of talk time, is less than I'd like. But the phone has days if not weeks of standby time, because there aren't a lot of background processes chewing up battery.. See How We Test Cell Phones. If you're going to connect to US cellular networks in 2017, and especially in 2019, you really need LTE, and the 3310 doesn't support it. The phone works on the 850/1900MHz 2G and 3G GSM bands. I couldn't figure out what variety of HSPA data it uses, except that it isn't particularly fast. Still, though, it's quite a lot faster than a 2G EDGE phone would be.. The 3310 doesn't work on Sprint or Verizon at all. On T-Mobile, it's only compatible with the sliver of a 1900MHz 2G network the carrier has left around for Internet-of-things gadgets. I found that T-Mobile coverage dropped anywhere inside our office building. The 3310 has better AT&T coverage on AT&T's 3G 850/1900 network. But there, too, AT&T has started to slowly cannibalize its older network for 4G.. Your best bet is to pair the 3310 with a low-cost carrier that uses the AT&T network. Red Pocket's $10, 500-minute plan fits the bill nicely, for instance, and there's no commitment, so if AT&T decides to reduce its 3G coverage, you aren't stuck.. The phone's lack of Wi-Fi also hurts its voice capabilities. All the US carriers now have some kind of Wi-Fi calling solution, but you won't get it here.. The Bluetooth 2.1 is noticeably lower quality than on smartphones with Bluetooth 4.0 or higher. The phone wouldn't pair with my Plantronics Voyager Focus UC stereo headset, although it worked with a Voyager 5200 single-ear headset. But the connection to the 5200 was plagued by irritating pops and clicks, which I didn't experience with smartphones with Bluetooth 5.0.. I'd rather use a wired headset here, which also has the advantage of activating the 3310's built-in FM radio.. The 3310's Java-based Series 30+ interface has some of the standard old-phone apps. There's a calendar and contact book, a basic music player, a basic video player, and Opera Mini as its Web browser. You can download and run Java-based apps and games if you get hold of them, and you can access mobile Web sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail through Opera Mini. The phone comes with a few games, and they run sluggishly. I was deeply disappointed in the nouveau version of Snake, which 'upgrades' graphics and gameplay to look more like slither.io. The contact book has an intriguing feature which lets it sync contacts with an Android phone over Bluetooth, but it creates a huge number of duplicate contacts as each phone number becomes a new contact. Still, that's better than typing them all in. The calendar doesn't sync with anything and is rather useless.. With only 64MB of the built-in 128MB storage free, you'll want to add a microSD card, which fits in a slot under the battery. Don't use one bigger than 32GB, it won't work (we tried). The music player will gather together MP3, WAV, and M4A files from the memory card, but not OGG or FLAC. The video player handles old-school MPEG4 AVI files at up to VGA resolution, but don't try decoding H.264.. To get files on or off the phone, you can send them via Bluetooth, or use a standard micro USB cable and mass storage mode.. The phone's 2-megapixel camera feels like a lie. While it snaps photos quickly, the images are covered in hideous artifacts that look like they were upscaled or altered. The phone records 352-by-288 videos whose jerky quality harkens back to the previous decade.. You can use one of 12 tinny ringtones or your own MP3, but you can't assign ringtones by person or by group. The phone supports SMS and MMS, but not emoji (they just appear as boxes). You also have to triple-tap all your messages, there's no T9 or predictive text, which is an odd omission.. The Nokia 3310 is the cutest little voice phone we've seen this year. As long as you stick with AT&T, its feature set is on par with other cheap voice phones such as the Doro PhoneEasy 626 and the LG B470, although the B470 has an extra-loud mode and a text-to-speech function which seniors may like. Because the 3310 costs under $60 unlocked, it pairs well with cheap virtual-operator plans on the AT&T network, like Red Pocket's plans.. But I'm still disappointed because in a 2017 voice phone, I'd like to see a phone that excels in voice calls. I want to see a phone that takes advantage of features like VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling for the best possible reception, has current Bluetooth for clear connections, and receives the emoji that younger family members may want to send you. Because the kids don't call any more: They text you little pictures of pigs.. I don't think that phone exists, alas. Soon, we're going to check out the Alcatel Go Flip series, which works with T-Mobile's and Sprint's growing 4G LTE networks. It may point the way toward the future, rather than just acting like a phone from the past.. Bottom Line: The Nokia 3310 3G looks and feels like a 2005-era phone, which doesn't take advantage of 2017's voice technologies..

The Nokia 3310 3G looks and feels like a 2005-era phone, which doesn't take advantage of 2017's voice technologies.. Editor Rating: Good (3.0) Nov 15, 2017. Lacks T9 predictive text input and emoji. The Nokia 3310 3G looks and feels like a 2005-era phone, which doesn't take advantage of 2017's voice technologies.. There are a lot of people who could do with stepping back from their perpetual smartphone obsessions. Many of us would like to dial back to a day when you actually had to pay attention to the world around you. According to Pew , 18 percent of mobile-phone users in the US are still on feature phones, whether it's because they don't want to deal with smartphone features, or they don't want to pay for them. The $60 Nokia 3310 3G is an affordable, good-looking, unlocked phone for those looking for simple voice service. I just wish it had better network coverage, and bent just a bit more to the needs of 2017 society.. The Nokia 3310 3G is an attractive, pastel-colored lozenge that comes in blue, gray, red, or yellow. It measures 4.6 by 2.1 by 0.5 inches (HWD) and weighs a light 3.1 ounces The silver plastic buttons are clicky, if cheap-feeling. The top half of the phone is a somewhat dim 320-by-240 color TFT LCD screen. The speakerphone, camera, and flashlight are on the back panel. It isn't water-resistant, but by virtue of being a very simple phone with a plastic screen, it'll likely handle minor drops without a problem.. There are several, physically identical versions of the 3310 being sold. Some of them don't support US networks. The one you need is model TA-1036. I might as well also mention that this phone has some sort of cult nostalgia thing going in Europe, where the original 3310 was spectacularly popular in the early 2000s. The original 3310 was never released in the US, although a variant, the 3390, had limited success on AT&T and T-Mobile in 2003.. View All 8 Photos in Gallery.
