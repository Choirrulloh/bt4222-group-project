The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. A blast from the past gets a modern day update. The Nokia 3310 is a nostalgia-fueled re-release that can't do anything as well as a smartphone can, but for a low price this may suit you as a second device to take to festivals or keep in your bag for emergencies.. It doesn’t matter if you hate the new Nokia 3310, it’s already done its job New Nokia 3310 price and release date Out now in the UK, but not yet in the US or Australia Won't work on US mobile networks, so don't try to import it Costs £49.99 (around $65, AU$90) Design Small and light Retro, plastic design Doesn't look exactly like the original Nokia 3310 though Display Low resolution screen It's in color, but doesn't respond to touch. If any phone can sell itself on nostalgia alone, that phone is the Nokia 3310.. It’s one of the most popular mobiles of all time, remembered for its near-indestructible build, long-lasting battery and legendary Snake (well, Snake 2 if we’re being accurate) game, and the team licensing the Nokia phone name has jumped at the chance to reignite the love for a phone which was once the leader in the mobile market.. Enter the new Nokia 3310, a homage to the iconic handset with a helping of modern-day upgrades. If you were a fan of the 3310 and long for those simpler times, the likelihood is you’ll want to pick this up.. If you're less familiar with the original though, this is just another feature phone which won't satisfy your smartphone sensibilities with a price that's steeper than it needs to be.. The original phone sold 126 million units, so while this will never reach that kind of level of sales it may suit those who want to use a feature phone or have a cheaper alternative phone to take to festivals or as a backup in their bag while away.. The Nokia 3310 price is £49.99 (around $65, AU$90), placing it perfectly as a secondary phone purchase, and it’s one that will likely appeal to both Nokia fans and festival goers.. Some will balk at having to pay that much for a ‘dumb phone’, especially when similarly spec'd feature phones can be had for almost half the price.. There's no question the 3310 name is influencing the price here, and if you're looking for value for money there are better handsets out there.. But for those who simply want to own the new 3310 - and these people do exist - it's still an accessible price tag.. Carphone Warehouse is stocking the Nokia 3310 in the UK for £49.99, but you can only buy it online and some of the most popular color choices are regularly out of stock.. You can also buy it through EE and Vodafone, but we've noticed both networks are out of stock quite often so you may need to shop around for the best choice.. Meanwhile Three and O2 have ruled themselves out for now. It’s only a limited release at the moment though, so it may be some time before you’re able to pick it up.. Those in the US will have to wait longer, as the current version of the Nokia 3310 won’t work with the country’s mobile networks. A release in Australia is still unclear too.. In a rush? Watch our week with review of the new Nokia 3310 below.... Look at the new Nokia 3310 front-on and there’s no mistaking the phone it is paying homage to. This looks like the younger and slightly more attractive sibling of the original Nokia 3310.. The distinctive border around the screen and the layout of the 'num' keys give you the retro throwback, but Nokia has majorly slimmed down and modernized the design, making the new 3310 supremely pocketable.. When you’re carrying this phone around, you won’t even know it’s in your pocket if you’re used to carrying around a smartphone such as the OnePlus 3T. We found it didn’t weigh our pockets down and could even slip in next to our wallet.. It tips the scales at just 79.6g, making it comfortably lighter than the 137g original.. Unlike a lot of modern phones, it’s made of plastic. You may not love this design, but this is one way HMD has been able to keep the price low for the new Nokia 3310.. For Nokia 3310 purists though, the new reboot will be somewhat of a disappointment. We've spoken to many people about the new 3310, and a number said they'd rather HMD had kept the design closer to the original.. We're inclined to agree - it would have been nice for the new handset to follow the original a little more closely in terms of look - but it is a design that remains practical and functional.. See how the new 3310 shapes up against the original in our versus video. Considering it’s plastic construction, it still feels comfortable to hold and it won’t slip out of your hand like some phones made with of can easily do. During our review time we successfully avoided dropping the new Nokia 3310.. It may not be as legendarily sturdy as the original Nokia 3310, but it should be able to take a few more knocks than other phones you can buy in 2017.. In terms of colors, you’ll have the choice of four for the new Nokia 3310. Those are the traditional dark blue – the phone we used for this review – and grey, while there are also new psychedelic yellow and warm red colors.. Both of those new colors are a little closer to the Nokia Lumia phones of recent years, but we prefer the dark blue version of the phone, and it seems we’re not alone, as this appears to be one of the most commonly available shades.. The design of the Nokia 3310 feels freshened up, but we can understand how some people are a little disappointed this phone doesn’t look more like the original.. Unlike your modern smartphone, there’s not much room for the display on the new Nokia 3310. Instead it’s banished to the top half of the phone and is only 2.4 inches big.. This time it’s a bright, full color display, but the resolution isn’t particularly impressive at 240 x 320. You’ll particularly notice how low the resolution is when you’re looking at photos.. That’s a bit of a shame considering entry-level smartphones that don't cost all that much more than the 'dumb' 3310 can pack 720p HD displays.. For the basic tasks that you'll want to use this for though, such as texting and calling, you don’t need a super crisp display and the screen on the new 3310 suffices. Needless to say though, you won't be watching any videos on it and gaming is graphically basic.. Also note this isn't a touchscreen, so you won’t be able to tap on the screen to interact with it. You’ll need to navigate around the phone with the button below instead.. Next Page What's it like to use?. You can unsubscribe at any time and we'll never share your details without your permission..

This article is about the phone released in 2017. For the original phone of the same name, see Nokia 3310 .. GSM (original version) GSM / HSPA (3G version). Nokia 3310 (2017) is a Nokia -branded mobile phone developed by HMD Global. It was announced on 26 February 2017 at Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017 in Barcelona , Spain, as a revival of the original Nokia 3310 that was produced from early-to-mid-2000s. An improved model with 3G support was released on 29 October 2017.. 2 Features and design. On 14 February 2017, it was reported that a modernised version of the 3310 would be unveiled at the 2017 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona by HMD Global Oy , a Finnish manufacturer with rights to market phones under the Nokia brand, with the price point of 59 euros. [3] [4] On 26 February 2017, the modernised version of the 3310 was relaunched at a price of € 49. The initial 3310 release only came with support for 2G networks, [6] which led to criticism especially as a number of countries, including the United States , [7] Australia and Singapore [8] were in the process of phasing out their 2G networks; an improved variant of the phone with support for 3G networks was later announced by HMD, released on 29 October 2017. The phone features basic functions, like an FM radio , the Opera Mini web browser , and a voice recorder. It features a 2-megapixel camera with flash for photos and video recording. The flash LED doubles as a flashlight. It also features Bluetooth 3.0 functionality and a dual-SIM tray in certain models. [10] It also has a polarized layer for improved display outdoors.. The original Snake game has been replaced by Gameloft 's Snake Xenzia with updated modes and graphics. It is also possible to sideload Java -based applications using the .jad and .jar format. Available apps are browsers, games, internet radios, etc.. The design of the phone heavily mimics its predecessor both in design and form factor. It comes in two glossy colors, red and yellow, as well as two matte colors similar to the original Nokia 3310: dark blue and grey.. The 3G model has many improvements and changes apart from the 3G radio. The internal storage has been increased to 128 MB from 16 MB [11] [12] , and there are some cosmetic changes, including a new silver keypad. [13] It comes in four new colors: Yellow, Warm Red, Azure and Charcoal, all being matte. [14] The phone's size has slightly increased (by 13.29%) to ergonomically make typing on the keyboard easier. The 3G radio has reduced battery talk time, but slightly increased standby time. On the software side, the 3310 3G also runs an upgraded operating system that HMD have called "Feature OS" powered by Java. Its appearance is similar to the Series 30+ as on the 2G version, but has a new customizable interface and other improvements. A 4G version was released in late January 2018 in China in partnership with China Mobile. It runs YunOS , an incompatible fork of AOSP (Android), and can create WiFi hotspots using the LTE data connection. Internal storage has been increased to 512 MB, and 64 GB memory cards are now supported. HMD announced on 2 July 2017 that the 3310 received great demand and was as a result sold out in many markets. [20] UK retailer Carphone Warehouse said on 10 March that demand was "astonishing". ^ Spec for the original version. ^ Blass, Evan (13 February 2017).

Nokia has been through the wringer and emerged as a transformed company. It now owns the sports fitness brand Withings , is active in developing Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and communications technologies, and --via HMD Global -- has its name back on mobile phones.. Announced at Mobile World Congress in February, the Nokia 3310 harks back to the original 3310, which launched back in 2000. Nokia hopes its new take on what was a firm favourite at the turn of the millennium will lure those who want a simple but robust phone with exceptional battery life.. Part of me wants to write this review with my nostalgia hat on (and that hat will see the light of day), but the rest needs to put this 'retro' phone into today's market. Does it function well enough to be a success at the £50 price?. The new Nokia 3310 isn't a blocky simulacrum of the original. Instead it's more curved, much thinner and has a considerably larger screen. The screen is also colour, whereas the original's was monochrome.. The small D-pad beneath the screen, along with the large Call and End buttons, cater for movement around icons and menus -- the screen may be colour, but it's not touch sensitive. A touchscreen fan might find all this a hassle, although many landline phones employ the same conventions -- as do many 'feature phones' in the mobile market.. Text entry is via the number pad in classic T9 fashion, involving multiple key presses to cycle through numbers and letters or other characters. I found it amazing how my T9 knowledge came flooding back as I created my first few messages.. You can get the Nokia 3310 in Warm Red and Yellow (gloss finish), and Dark Blue and Grey (matte finish).. The Nokia 3310 is available in four colours. Mine was a rather sober dark blue, but there are also red, yellow and grey variants. The build is very solid and the front and back look as though they should be quite scratch resistant. My matte-finish handset was also nicely grippy.. The handset bulges to a maximum 51mm at its midriff, making it narrow enough to fit snugly into a small palm such as mine, and it's short enough at 115.6mm not to poke out of the top of my favourite jacket pocket. At 12.8mm it's thick compared to today's slimline handsets, although the device's proportions are pleasing. It weighs just 79g including the battery.. The 3310's tight-fitting backplate pops off to reveal a battery that needs to be removed to access the Micro-SIM and MicroSD slots, which are stacked one on top of the other.. The screen may be larger than that of the 2000 version of this handset, but it isn't anything to write home about. It measures 2.4 inches across the diagonal or (by my measurements) 3.6mm wide and 4.9mm tall. It has a QVGA resolution of just 240 by 320 pixels.. Can you see individual pixels? Yes. But frankly that doesn't matter, because this isn't a handset on which you'll be watching catch-up TV, reading a novel or browsing websites -- unless you really have to.. There's no wi-fi and no GPS, and communications are limited to 2G on the 900MHz and 1800MHz bands. You do get Bluetooth 3.0 though.. Don't be fooled by the Series 30+ name that's given to the operating system. This is not related to Nokia's entry-level Series 30 OS from the old days. Instead, Series 30+ is the MediaTek-developed platform that was used by Microsoft Mobile when it took over Nokia. The OS is now in the hands of HMD Global, the Finnish handset maker responsible for the 3310 and other Nokia-branded handsets.. The 2017 Nokia 3310 has a 2.4-inch non-touch colour screen. D-pad navigation and predictive text entry are the order of the day here.. For the technically minded it's worth noting that Series 30+ does not run J2ME applications like the old Series 30 did. Instead, where handsets support it, Series 30+ runs apps in the MAUI Runtime Environment. The Nokia 3310 is pre-populated with a range of stock apps, and has a store.. The general layout of the user interface and the stable of built-in apps will be familiar to anyone who can remember using old Nokia feature phones, or later Microsoft Mobile variants.. A grid offers icons that take you to apps like messaging, music player, weather, an FM radio, videos, notes, calendar, calculator, alarm clock, file manager, camera and voice recorder.. An Extras menu hides a countdown timer, a stopwatch, a torch toggle for the camera LED and a unit converter. Web browsing is via Opera Mini, but good luck with that on 2G: I ground my teeth just like I remember doing years ago.... There's also a game called Snake, but it's not the same as Nokia's original Snake.. This shoots at 2 megapixels and isn't much use for anything beyond on-handset images. With just 1.4MB of the 16MB of internal storage available, it's probably a good thing that you won't want to take too many photos.. Snake, but not as you remember it.. The overall performance of the Nokia 3310, in the short time I had it, was fine -- with the exception of that teeth-grindingly slow browsing. I made calls and sent texts, I listened to music played from a MicroSD card and used the FM radio -- which needs an attached headset to form the antenna.. The provided headset is lacklustre, but plugging in a better one didn't noticeably improve sound quality either. Audio was OK, but not great, through the single rather tinny speaker. Irritatingly some surfaces damped the sound from the speaker considerably. To console myself I played Snake, and fiddled with the selection of brash and plinky ringtones.. The 1,200mAh battery, which is charged via Micro-USB, is rated as good for up to 22 hours of talk, 31 days on standby, 51 hours of MP3 playback and 39 hours of radio. I didn't have the handset to test for very long, but I never came close to running low on power, and could go for days on end without even thinking about recharging.. The Nokia 3310 does the basics well enough, by which I mean making calls, sending texts, listening to some (mediocre quality) music and playing the odd game. Its excellent battery life is a major plus point.. But there is an elephant in the room, and that's the price: £50 is just too expensive -- even £30 would be too expensive. The Nokia 3310 really needs wi-fi and better than 2G dual-band connectivity. To take a handset at random for comparison: the Nokia 215 , released in 2015, has quite similar specifications and is available right now for £15..

Nostalgia for the win Great battery life Now with microSD!. No 3G Why not buy a smartphone instead. We review the new Nokia 3310, a 2017 update of Nokia’s classic feature phone with all-new OS and modern upgrades. just a throwaway novelty, or a genuinely usable handset?. Nokia is on a welcome resurgence in 2017 with the launch of the new Nokia 6 , Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 handsets, a trio of affordable Android smartphones set to take on the likes of the Moto G5 and Sony Xperia XA1. We’re even expecting a fourth, flagship-style device to hit soon: the enticing Nokia 9 .. However, the Nokia announcement that received the most attention at MWC 2017 was the reveal of an updated, all-new 3310 feature phone. Yep, the classic is back in a reimagined form, with new features like Bluetooth and micro USB support in tow. Not to mention a fresh new OS, which still has plenty of retro styling.. So why would you want to buy a 3310 in 2017? Well, there’s the obvious nostalgia value, plus the handset could make for a dependable secondary handset for festivals and trips. boasts up to a month of battery life and can even be used to get online.. Read next: Nokia 3310 (2017) vs Nokia 3310 (original). The Nokia 3310 has been refined for this 2017 release and we have to admit, that smart design work is a large part of the phone’s appeal.. You can pick it up in a couple of bright, shiny colours, with the red and yellow models both standing out and demanding to be flashed on the tube. More sombre types can go for the dark blue and grey handsets instead.. That compact and lightweight build and. make for a mobile that’s super comfortable to fondle. However, the plastic casing does pick up light scratches rather easily. Handle with care if you don’t want to scuff up and ruin that pristine finish.. Beneath the dinky screen you get a number of buttons. That central directional pad is used to navigate through menus, while the two surrounding buttons answer or hang up calls, as well as selecting the on-screen menus above them. Then of course you have a dial pad, which is also used to type – ahh, the joys of constructing an email on one of these little buggers.. You can actually prise off the back end of the new 3310, to access the removable battery and card slots.. A 2.4-inch screen is your portal into Nokia’s updated Series 30+ operating system. This polarised panel is super-bright too, so can easily cut through glare when outside.. Of course, the WVGA resolution means images will look rather blocky, while colours are far from realistically reproduced. What do you expect at this price point, a gorgeous Full HD screen?. You can actually listen to MP3s on the Nokia 3310 in this 2017 incarnation. You only get 16MP of storage built-in, but a 32GBB microSD memory card can be slotted inside to expand if desired. There’s also an FM radio on board.. A tiny speaker on the back end trumps out a tinny bit of audio when watching video or playing music, bbut we’d recommend using earphones instead. The pair that comes bundled with the new 3310 is only good enough for taking calls really, and they shred your inner ear with too much use. Luckily this handset has Bluetooth support built in, if you want to go wireless, as well as the 3.5mm jack.. As mentioned, the updated 2017 version of the Nokia 3310 sports an updated interface compared with the original feature phone.. To see the OS and the various features in action, check out our video tour at the bottom of this review. In a nutshell, you get all of the usual feature phone tools, including an alarm clock, calendar, calculator, audio notes and so on. On top of this you can browse the web with the Opera Mini Browser, play games such as the updated Snake and use the 2-megapixel camera to shoot basic snaps. As this is a feature phone, performance is of course pretty basic. Not that you’ll want to attempt anything demanding anyway. You can play simple games like Snake and Asphalt 6, which have the kind of stunning frame rate you’d expect.. Sadly there’s no 3G support, so you’re stuck with 2G for getting online. Be prepared for lots of shoe tapping as you wait for websites to load, if you actually dare to use the browser for whatever reason.. Battery life is of course fantastic, as with all feature phones. You can get days of use as long as you aren’t hammering Snake to try and beat your high score, or hours and hours of talk time per charge. That 1200mAh battery doesn’t take long to fill. We’re glad to see micro USB connectivity included too, which makes charging the 3310 and copying files on and off pleasingly simple.. Slapped on the back of the new Nokia 3310 is a 2-megapixel colour camera, complete with LED flash. This is of course a very basic shooter, although you can quickly capture shareable snaps when needed.. Functionality is as simple as it comes, with a point-and-snap mentality. You can turn on some ugly filters if you want to, digitally zoom and even switch to busrt mode for capturing lots of shots in quick succession (as long as you have a microSD card slotted inside). And the new Nokia 3310 is even capable of capturing some basic video footage.. Don’t expect any kind of detail or realistic colour reproduction from your shots and you’ll probably get on fine with the 3310’s camera. It’s perfectly fine for capturing random snaps when you have nothing better available. Check out a couple of our test photos in the image below (click to enlarge).. If you want to see the Nokia 3310 in action, check out our full unboxing and in-depth hands-on session in the video below. This shows off all of the 3310’s main features, including a bit of gaming, web browsing and even some YouTube streaming.. Should you buy the Nokia 3310, for a bit of retro fun and nostalgic joy? Well, that depends if you’ve got £50 sat in your pocket and nothing better to do with it. There’s a reason these phones aren’t seen any more in the UK, and that’s because they’re obsolete.. After all, smartphones offer greater connectivity, fuller functionality and bigger, better displays. You can pick up blowers from the likes of Alcatel for the same cost as the 2017 edition of the 3310, with full 3G or even 4G support and proper touch interfaces.. For all of the kitsch cuteness that the 3310 offers, it’s also quite tedious to use for anything other than phone calls. Still, that cute factor alone wins it a three-star score, because anyone who buys it will do so simply to own a slice of history.. Thanks to Vodafone for the review sample.

Other connectivity features include Bluetooth v3.0, microUSB 2.0 and all the regulars to keep up with this modern trend in phones. Nokia 3310 is the longest running phone and one of the world's best-selling handsets making it to the top 15 list of all-time list. And it looks to make a legendary return as the Nokia 3310 (2017) - a keypad phone in an age of touchscreen devices.. Nokia is the one who first changed the whole idea of communication by manufacturing utilitarian mobile devices and putting them into everyone's hand. Since then, mobile devices have gone on to large screens and replaced buttoned keypads completely.. But this Nokia 3310 (2017) looks to go against the trend, win over new buyers and its smarter touchscreen cousins. This is going back to old-school utilities and a device which was once considered simply indestructible.. There are some things which are better off left unchanged. This Nokia 3310 (2017) has the same plastic body casing reminiscent of what it was back then. Its shape is more or less just as it used to be with the round-shaped body. It's smaller than before with dimensions coming in at 115.6 x 51 x 12.8 mm (4.55 x 2.01 x 0.50 inches). And it's seemingly lighter than the previous model too.. A 2.4 inch 240 x 320 pixels 167 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) display is something it remotely shares with its predecessor. But this time around, it comes with colors instead of a monochrome. It's bright and smart and even to some extent cute by being miles away from the 1080p 7-inch life-like displays around. This is exactly the beauty of this Nokia 3310 (2017). The display is curved with a polarized layer up top for better readability in bright conditions.. This device emulates the same user interface with only some added colors and features. Named as the Nokia Series 30+, toggling through the phone is fun. And there are millions who missed the sound which these button pads used to make along with the same icons inside.. Nokia 3310 (2017) comes with a 2 MP camera to keep in touch with times for a change. It comes with an added LED flash as well. Snaps are simple and actually much better than what might be expected from it.. Powered by a 1200 mAh Lithium-Ion battery, Nokia 3310 (2017) has a standby time to last for more than a month. Talk-time comes in at around 22 Hours.. As one of the fastest growing economic regions, South-East Asia has come up as a leading manufacturing and consuming market for multiple tech products especially mobile devices. And most of this growth is spearheaded by the Philippines which hosts most of these manufacturers along with a consumer base with a high market demand.. The Nokia 3310 (2017) is something completely against the current mobile device trend and spectrum. But still, it has an obvious high potential of usage in markets where low-end devices sell more than comprehensively. This is one of the hottest news in the world and the response in Philippines looks to make this device easily to the top of the sales sheets.. User Review : 4 Reviews.

( in response to mr_l84 ). We don't have any news about upcoming Nokia equipment, but we appreciate the feedback! It's clear you've had a majorly awesome experience with their equipment if you're still hanging on to that token Lumia! We'll pass the vote (and artart 's second) along.. Like Show 1 Likes (1). Re: Will the Nokia 3310 (2017 edition) make it to T-Mobile?. ( in response to tmo_marissa ). Just to be clear, the Nokia Lumia 925 is alright, but I'm not a smartphone type of person. I still have my second cellphone, the one I had before getting the Lumia, my T-Mobile Nokia 1208! Man I loved that phone! I still take it and put the SIM card out of my Lumia in it from time to time and use it for a few days here and there. I can do that because of the way the SIM door closes down on the miniature sized SIM card I had to cut to get it to fit in the Lumia. The ONLY problem I have with the Nokia 1208 is that a lot of people like sending group or picture messages, either of which it can't handle, so after a few days I take the SIM out and go back to using the Lumia. Between my wife and I we've always had Nokia candybars, a 6610 and a 6030, and we loved those as well.. The new 2017 Nokia 3310 looks like everything I've wanted in a phone. Besides being basic, it has exactly all the advanced features I want: 1) a micro SD card port, 2) a headphone jack and 3) Bluetooth (now that I actually have a device that uses Bluetooth, my new car.) The camera is a plus. I really don't want the ability to "google" or to read e-mails or such (I have a laptop for that purpose), so the new Nokia 3310 obviously has a bit more than what I personally want and need. But at least it doesn't have way more than I want and need like on a smartphone. If I got one for one of my children I could easily have data service turned off and not have to worry about Wi-Fi connectivity like with the new Alcatel GoFlip. Plus, these kinds of phones are much more durable than any smartphone. The first week I had my Lumia I dropped it flat on cement and shattered the screen. But the Nokia candybars we've had just wouldn't die.. Like Show 1 Likes (1). Re: Will the Nokia 3310 (2017 edition) make it to T-Mobile?.

But it doesn't come in the right frequency yet. Only 1800, not 1900, or something like that. Plus, if I remember correctly, T-Mobile is scheduled to shutdown its 2G network in the near future and the Nokia 3310 is a 2G-only phone. Hopefully Nokia will get this phone made in a 4G LTE version (for compatability reasons, not that I need internet in my pocket) and T-Mobile will add it to its list of phones for sale.. I'm probably asking for a lot.. Like Show 2 Likes (2). Re: Will the Nokia 3310 (2017 edition) make it to T-Mobile?.

Re: Will the Nokia 3310 (2017 edition) make it to T-Mobile?. ( in response to tidbits ). But it won't work on T-Mobile, nor on any US carrier for that matter.. I guess I could get one to use as a MP3 player and then just pretend to make phone calls.. Like Show 1 Likes (1). Re: Will the Nokia 3310 (2017 edition) make it to T-Mobile?. ( in response to mr_l84 ). Well, seeing the new Nokia 3310 has got me feeling nostalgic. So for the past few weeks I've stopped using my Nokia Lumia 925 and brought out my Nokia 1208. Well about my only problem with this phone is that so many people send MMS messages instead of SMS messages, which this phone doesn't handle. So I found a used ZTE Cymbal Z-320 flip phone and traded Grandpa for his (what I believe to be) Nokia 2720 flip phone. Man! It's nice to have a little Nokia in my pocket again! And Grandpa likes the gigantic Z-320 because he can see the buttons and front screen better.. Maybe I could start a collection of Nokia phones. But sadly the day is coming when I won't be able to use these little 2G phones ever again.. Like Show 1 Likes (1). Re: Will the Nokia 3310 (2017 edition) make it to T-Mobile?. ( in response to mr_l84 ). That is a sweet line-up! And what a nice trade! I hope your Grandpa is having a blast with some of the other added features of his new phone, too.. Like Show 2 Likes (2). Re: Will the Nokia 3310 (2017 edition) make it to T-Mobile?. ( in response to mr_l84 ). I'll vote for the other Nokia new releases, especially the Nokia 9. Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 have been released. Best Nokia phones coming in 2017 - Nokia 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 specs and info. Like Show 3 Likes (3). Re: Will the Nokia 3310 (2017 edition) make it to T-Mobile?. ( in response to mr_l84 ). T-Mobile's network will be fully supported. The Nokia 6 will launch in the US next month for $229. Bear in mind, however, that the device will not support Verizon and Sprint's CDMA networks. ; but only "partial" support - excluding bands 29 and 30 - will be available for AT&T's 4G LTE data services..

Re: Will the Nokia 3310 (2017 edition) make it to T-Mobile?. ( in response to mr_l84 ). I just picked up the new version from BestBuy. The reception is horrible the signal rarely will show 3g and when it does it doesn't last long. The build quality is not like the older Nokia phones. You can hear static when you are dialing someone. I am going to keep using it until it dies which will most likely won't be too long.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). Re: Will the Nokia 3310 (2017 edition) make it to T-Mobile?. ( in response to flexte ). That's sad to hear! I wonder if that's all Nokia's fault or if part of the call quality is T-Mobile. I get the feeling that T-Mobile, as well as all other carriers, have no interest in maintaining good 2G and 3G calling quality. Whereas before I would get much better reception on my 2G Nokias than anyone else's 4G smartphone I find that now it's the other way around. Still, it's sad to see that companies, even with brands like Nokia, don't have much interest in making quality basic phones. I just hate the Android/Apple/internet-in-your-pocket duopoly.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). Re: Will the Nokia 3310 (2017 edition) make it to T-Mobile?. ( in response to mr_l84 ). I suggest getting a phone when everything switches to LTE only.. When that happens look for basic phones that support that or chances are that will be the nail in the coffin for basic phones.. It is expected all carriers will have this done by 2020 at the earliest and 2022 at the latest.. Find ways to contact us now.

Covering the Best of Nokia Phones and HMD Global. Posted in Feature Phones Tagged nokia 3310 , security code. Nokia 3310 (2017) – Default Security Code. Posted on July 15, 2017 by Haris Nadeem Feature Phones. Nokia 3310 was launched by HMD Global / Nokia as a brand new phone this year, and we’d like to call it the Nokia 3310 (2017). It is still a feature phone with a basic Java OS running on it. It’s hard to believe if anyone would still go for a feature phone in this day and age, but surprisingly, a big number of customers bought this phone when it went on sale last month. Among several tips, the most asked question is about the default security code that is on the Nokia 3310 (2017) phone.. From the beginning of Nokia phones, the default security code has been the very same five digits. You may need this security code when making changes to the security settings or when trying to reset the phone settings to factory defaults.. The default security code of Nokia 3310 (2017) is: 12345. However, it is always recommended to change this code to something you can easily remember. Since this code is default for every phone, if you phone goes into unwanted hands, anyone can wipe off your data or access security settings with this code. So it is better to change it as soon as possible.. We have the Nokia 3310 with us and over the next few days, we will be covering a handful of neat tips and tricks about the phone.. An old Nokia fan from the days of the popular Nokia 3310. Haris is the Chief Editor at NokiaTips.com and also runs several other technology publications. View all posts by Haris Nadeem.

Classic number or the worst comeback since Chinese Democracy?. Editor Rating: Good (3.0) May 26, 2017. Herculean month-long battery.Facebook, Gmail and Google Search load quickly.Fun retro factor (Snake, Grande Valse ringtone, etc).. Call quality is poor.It’s a 2G phone... in 2017.Nostalgia is for overgrown crybabies.. The new Nokia 3310 is a fun, if basic, mobile best suited as a back up for festivals, trips and holidays where your more expensive primary phone might easily get lost, damaged or stolen.. Nokia 3310 (2017) Design, OS and layout. Nokia 3310 (2017) Social media, email and web browsing. Nokia 3310 (2017) Camera: 2 megapixel pea shooter. Nokia 3310 (2017) Super strong battery. Nokia 3310 (2017) 2G or not 2G?. Nokia 3310 (2017) Price: It’s cheap (but not that cheap). A quick Google reveals two ancient Greek root words for the modern day English ‘nostalgia’; ‘nostos’, which means ‘return home’ and ‘algos’, which means grief. This could probably serve as the watchword for this review.. Yes, the new 2017 edition of the Nokia 3310 is fundamentally an exercise in tugging on the heartstrings of those who owned one of these back in their school/college days.. Let’s be honest, anyone else was either too young or too old to care; your pocket money either couldn’t cover those BT Cellnet vouchers quick enough or you were a self respecting nerd/business type on a full time salary, in which case you’d be rocking either a Palm TX or a BlackBerry 5810 .. I’ll fess up to having owned an original Nokia 3310; I was taken by its durability, powerful battery, that ringtone and, yes, Snake. I have about as much desire to buy a new 3310 as I do to move back in with the folks (sorry, Mum and Dad), work for £2.89 an hour on weekends (thanks, British Home Stores) and listen to So Solid Crew (no offence, Romeo).. Personal disinclination towards nostalgia aside, is the new 2017 edition of the Nokia 3310 actually worth fifty quid? Read on.... The new Nokia 3310 riffs on the look and feel of its old ‘candybar’ style predecessor. As with the original, a light grey plastic shawl lapel surrounds the screen - a 2.4-inch 320x240 colour LCD - and a central d-pad doubles as a confirmation key.. It’s available in four colours - red, yellow, white and grey - with the matt grey actually closer to the dark navy blue of the original 3310, another nod to Nokia’s heritage.. There’s no external volume control, but when you’re taking a call, listening to music or playing back voice recordings, you can use the main d-pad to turn the sound up or down accordingly. There’s no dedicated camera key either; again, that d-pad key defaults as the main ‘OK’ button for more or less everything on the Nokia 3310.. The battery cover pops off to reveal a removable 1,200mAh battery, which you’ll need to take out in order to add your micro SIM card and microSD memory card (officially up to 32GB). Up on the top left sits a micro USB port for charging and there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack at the base.. One of the key selling points of old school Nokias was the fact that there was a logic to the layout of the Symbian OS and that’s present and correct here.. From the home screen you can opt to open up a customisable list of short cuts with the left key, dive into the main menu with the d-pad or open up the camera with the right key.. Despite some silly design choices - the icons for the web browser and the app store are virtually indistinguishable - the layout is clear and simple. It’s testament to Symbian’s enduring smarts that it took us very little time to get reacquainted with it. Equally, it didn’t take long for us to get used to T9 predictive text.. But, it has to be said, it took an even shorter span of time to remember why nobody uses this anymore. Despite the occasional autocorrect fail, we really have come on leaps and bounds since the dawn of the touchscreen era. Texting is slow, methodical and painstaking on the 3310.. The screen size and layout means that it’s also not possible to read the last message in a chain while writing your reply, which compounds frustration. If you can put up with these minor inconveniences, it’s otherwise fine for texting.. Yep, so the Nokia 3310 isn’t a 3G phone, meaning at the very most you’ll be cruising the Internet at breakneck speeds of 384kbps.. That said, we found that to our surprise, Facebook, Gmail and the BBC News page loaded pretty quickly. Scrolling through feeds and web pages using the d-pad instead of our fingers is less fun, as is painstakingly entering passwords, comments and replies using the T9 keyboard.. In all honestly, we don’t feel this will be a huge problem for most people interested in the new 3310. It’s good to know that in a pinch you can at least check up on emails and Facebook notifications.. The version of Snake bundled with the new 3310 isn’t the same Snake II we knew and tolerated loved way back when.. Made by Gameloft, this shiny new colour version sees you piloting a yellow serpent around a borderless arena, gobbling food while trying not to drive it into its own tail. Once again, you use the 4 and 6 keys to turn left and right, but whereas in the past you’d execute a sharp 90 degree turn, this time around you make a 45 degree pivot. It’s still good fun, just not ye olde Snake of yore.. Surprise surprise, the new Nokia 3310’s camera isn’t much cop. Fixed focus plus the fact that you can’t see how good or bad your snaps are via at the teeny tiny screen means you can end up with some real clangers, like the Lego figures below.. The single LED flash is also weak, only providing decent illumination on subjects if you’re about a metre away.. Like a lot of cheapy phone cameras, if the natural lighting conditions are adequate, you’ll be able to take some OK snaps of your lunch for social sharing, but don’t expect any miracles.. Given that the Nokia 3310 is being pitched as a good value does-the-basics buy, it's disapointing to note that call quality is sub par.. Even in quiet rooms with full signal and the volume all the way up, we had to occasionally get whoever was on the other end to repeat themselves, thanks to muffled and distorted speech.. The Nokia 3310’s battery would outpace the Duracell bunny. On paper you get 22 hours of talk time with this and a pretty incredible month’s worth of standby power. Obviously we’ve not had the phone long enough to see how that latter claim measures up, but since we have had it, we’ve not had to desperately scramble for a charging cable once, which in this day and age counts as a novelty.. Then again, we’re increasingly seeing phone makers fine tune systems to the point where big flagships can get a half full tank after just 30 minutes of charging, keep tabs on users favourite apps and so on. Battery life is finally starting to approach 2001 levels again. Note that the 3310’s screen is less than 3 inches, there’s no WiFi, no cutting edge 4G radios to help empty that cell. A low(ish) price, a powerful battery and next to no Internet services (in other words, no data-related bill shocks) means this is the ultimate holiday back up phone, right?. If you want a second phone to have stowed away in your dashboard in case of emergencies, the Nokia 3310 will more than suit. Remember that it needs a micro SIM card, which is one notch bigger than the nano SIMs most new phones take. This isn’t a huge deal - your local phone shop will sell you an adapter - but it’s something worth keeping in mind.. The Nokia 3310’s credentials as a holiday phone are undermined by the fact that it’s a 2G phone. While none of the UK networks appear to be canning their 2G operations anytime soon - partially thanks to us Brits being late to the 4G party - networks in the US, Canada, Australia and Singapore have either mothballed 2G services or they’re in the process of shutting them down. With the exception of Switzerland’s Swisscom, this hasn’t happened in Europe and won’t anytime soon.. In festival situations, we fancy the 3310’s chances a little less. It’s small, lightweight and easily losable, but that single LED flash does handily double as a torch, making staggering back to your tent in the middle of the night easier.. Dropping £50 on a phone might seem cheap, but note that for about £30 more, you can get a Motorola Moto E , a 4G Android phone with a 4.5-inch touchscreen.. If you wanted to save money, you could get a Nokia 105 , which pretty much does everything the Nokia 3310 does (minus the nostalgia kick) for £30 less. Whichever way you slice it, the Nokia 3310 is only really kind of a bargain.. It’s hard to be cynical about the new Nokia 3310 which is a pretty decent phone, one that’ll stir fond memories in buyers of a certain age and disposition.. It boasts a powerful battery, an OK Internet experience despite the lack of 3G or WiFi, but is let down by not great call quality.. Bargain hunters after either a cheap phone, or something that’ll do more than just the basics for less than £100, should look elsewhere.. All Nokia Android Phones from Now on Will Be Android One.

We take a look at the much-loved Nokia classic and how it compares to its 2017 refresh. Updated February 28, 2017 13:53 GMT. Legendary Nokia 3310 makes a comeback. What's changed in 17 years? IBTimes UK. Despite the roster of flagship smartphones and innovative new gadgets lining the halls of MWC this year, the biggest buzz has centred on the return of the Nokia 3310, which is arriving in selected markets this summer.. The €49 (£41) handset marks the revival of the retro classic which became one of the best-selling – and undoubtedly most famous – mobile phones of all time when it was launched in September 2000.. Needless to say the new device, which goes by the same name, has seen a few tweaks in the 17 years (give or take) since the original Nokia 3310's release.. For those of you interested to know exactly how much has changed in that time – or are perhaps still clinging to your original 3310 are finally considering that upgrade – here's a look at how the classic Nokia 3310 compares to its 2017 revival.. The Nokia 3310 was famed for its robustness. Back in the glory days of plastic construction, mobile phones were a good deal more hard-wearing than today's fragile glass-and-metal devices and could weather a fair beating before needing to be replaced. Even then you could fix most cosmetic blemishes by popping off the face plate and replacing it with a new one.. The new Nokia 3310 marks the revival of classic mobile phone adored by millions. The original candy bar-style phone measured 113 x 48 x 44mm, which is positively monstrous by today's standard, and tips the scales at 133g. The handset features a total of 16 physical buttons, including a 12-key numerical dial pad, navigation keys and a power button.. The Nokia 3310 (2017), maintains the retro charm of the original device with a similar candy bar design, numbered keypad and physical navigation buttons, albeit with a slightly more refined and ergonomic design. At 115.6 x 51 x 12.8mm, the Nokia 3310 (2017) is slightly taller than the original 3310 yet significantly slimmer, and lighter at just 79.8g. Here's hoping it'll be equally as durable.. The new Nokia 3310 maintains the retro look of its much older sibling, albeit with a modern twist. Back in 2000, the Nokia 3310's 84x48 pixel monochrome graphic display was standard fare for mobile phones. This could display up to five lines of text at once and was decent enough to display playable, albeit graphically limited, games.. The screen on the Nokia 3310 (2017) has been extended to 2.4in and now packs QVGA technology. At 320 x 240 pixels and offering full colour, it's a huge improvement over the old Nokia 3310 even if it pales in comparison to current flagship devices, which this in no way is. True to the original device, the 2017 edition doesn't pack a touchscreen.. The original 3310 featured an extremely simplified interface that allowed users to access calls, messages, games and setting by hitting the blue menu button and then navigating through options with the directional keys. At a time when a calculator and built-in stopwatch were considered notable features, there wasn't a whole lot you could do on with the Nokia 3310 beyond calling and texting people.. Legend says the Nokia 3310 was indesructible. The Nokia 3310 (2017) features the Nokia Series 30+ operating system found on a number of Nokia feature phones, and provides a more intuitive way of navigating the phone's menus. A 3x3 tile menu provides quick access to contacts, call logs, messages, photos, a calculator and Snake — yes, the old favourite is back, albeit in a slightly more glitzy affair that doesn't quite boast the simplistic appeal of the 3310's Snake II.. Mobile phones weren't the pocket-sized computers that today's smartphones are with connectivity very limited. The original Nokia 3310 featured 2G GSM connectivity on the 900MHZ and 1800MHz bands – so you could forget about browsing the 'net.. The Nokia 3310 (2017) gets a few of the goodies afforded by today's wireless technology, including Bluetooth, FM Radio (yes, there's a headphone jack), Bluetooth and a micro SD slot. Still, there's no Wi-Fi on board and connectivity is limited to 2.5G, allowing for an extremely basic web browsing experience.. The new Nokia 3310 has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a 2MP camera. You'd be hard-pressed to find a camera on a mobile phone back in the early 2000s, which didn't start becoming a common sight on handsets until the middle of the decade. As such, the original Nokia 3310 couldn't claim a single megapixel to its name.. The new Nokia 3310 does come with a camera, albeit a very basic one packing 2MP that will only snap very grainy-looking photos. It's certainly no Xperia ZX Premium, but at least it comes with a digital zoom and LED flash.. Despite it only packing a 900mAh battery, former Nokia 3310 users will regale you with stories of its battery lasting for days on end without needing charging. Indeed mobile phones were a lot less demanding those days (especially that non-colour display), which meant Nokia's handset was capable of around 4.5 hours of talk time and a massive 260 hours on standby without needing its power topped up.. The new Nokia 3310 comes with a larger 1,200mAh battery, which manufacturer HMD Global claims is good for up to 22 hours of talk time and up to a month on standby, which puts the original handset to shame.. HMD Global claims the new Nokia's battery will last up to a month on standby. Back when it was released you could pick up a Nokia 3310 for around £130 on a pay-as-you-go SIM. Today, the handset has become somewhat of a collector's item for retro tech lovers, meaning you could potentially pay upwards of £150 for a brand new, factory-sealed device from somewhere like eBay.. This is particularly ironic given that the new Nokia 3310 (2017) costs just £41 unlocked. Yet does it retain enough of the original's retro charm to rekindle our love affair with the phone? That's for the Snake fans to decide.. Be sure to follow us on Twitter @IBTimesUKTech for all the latest smartphone news and hands-on from MWC 2017..

The new Nokia phones: Nokia 3310 (2017), and Android-powered Nokia 6, 5, and 3 overview. by Victor Hristov. Tags :. Nokia - Nokia + MWC2017 - MWC2017 +. It has finally happened: Nokia, the company that was the king of both feature phones and smart phones until the iPhone came along, has returned. Kind of: it no longer has own manufacturing and it is a new company, HMD Global, with ex-Nokia brain-power at the helm. At MWC 2017, we saw the Nokia 6, a mid-range Android phone previously announced in China, go global, and two new affordable phones to go with it: the Nokia 5 and Nokia 3. But it was not smartphones that were the highlight of Nokia's presentation: it was an unpretentious call back from the past. It was the Nokia 3310, reimagined and refreshed. The indestructible phone, the subject of memes and legends, has gotten a visual overhaul, has the Snake game, a month of stand-by time, and... Yes, it all sounds nostalgic (we feel you), but those keys are surprisingly disappointing to type on. If you can deal with it, this is a perfect 'mobile phone rehab' phone. New Nokia 3310 Nokia 6 Nokia 5 Nokia 3. It's truly a modern classic reborn, as the company puts it, in the most literal way imaginable. The new 3310 is a lot like its predecessor, in that it boasts incredible battery life (22 hours of talk time and a month of stand-by), and it also plays Snake! The version of the legendary game that comes pre-loaded on the device is not a carbon copy of the original, however, so keep this in mind if you're planning on buying the new 3310 just for it. The new Nokia 3310 looks a lot like its grandfather and sports a similar egg-shaped design with an almost identical keypad below the screen. It also offers nothing in the way of Wi-Fi connectivity, GPS, apps, or any other "smart" features that we've become used to in the past decade or so. It has a 2MP camera on the back though!. The Nokia 6 goes global! After a China-only launch, the phone is ready to show itself to the whole wide world. What has it got to offer? A roomy 5.5-inch display with a 1080 x 1920 resolution, powered by the Snapdragon 430 chipset carrying an octa-core 1.4GHz CPU, and the Adreno 505 GPU. There is 4GB of RAM inside along with 64GB of native storage. The camera combo from back to front weighs in at 16GB and 8GB respectively. Keeping the lights on is a 3000mAh battery, and Android 7.0 is installed.. The Nokia 5 was briefly previewed as having a larger, 5.2-inch HD display, and will cost 189 Euros. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 with 2 GB RAM, the Nokia 5 is crafted out of a single sheet of anodized aluminum and has a 13 MP main camera, as well as a hearty 3000 mAh battery. The handset sports 16 GB of internal memory, but does offer a microSD slot for storage expansions, too.. The Nokia 3 is a basic cheap phone with absolutely nothing remarkable about it, except the Nokia brand name. It's a 5-inch phone with an HD screen made out of polycarbonate (yep, simple plastic) with an aluminum frame. It features an 8MP camera on both the front and the back, while under the hood there is a quad-core MediaTek processor, coupled with 2 GB RAM. You get a 2,650 mAh battery to keep the lights on, while the phone comes with a barely acceptable 16 GB of internal storage, plus a memory card slot if you need more. The best thing about the Nokia 3 is its price: €139, as cheap as it gets.. New Nokia 3310 camera turns out better than Galaxy S7 camera: an unbiased comparison. The original Nokia 3310 from 2000 didn't have a camera, but if it did, we're sure it'd have been rad. Fast-forward to 2017, though, and there's hardly a phone out there tha doesn't come with some sort of a snapper built into it. Good thing, then, that the brand spanking new 3310 from 2017 has one, and of the fancy-schmancy 2 megapixels at that! So we thought... maybe you guys would be interested in feasting your eyes on some real-life camera samples straight from this glorious shooter? You got it!. Moto G5 Plus vs Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) vs Nokia 6: specs comparison. The Moto G5 Plus, Samsung Galaxy A5 and Nokia 6 offer relatively similar specs, and yet they're very different devices... Nokia 3310 (2017) hands-on preview: Is it worthy of the legendary name?. HMD Global has brought the Nokia 3310 back from the dead. The new 3310 shares a lot of similarities with its predecessor, but it's coming out 17 years later. What is it and who is it for? Check out our hands-on preview of the new Nokia 3310 (2017)... Nokia 3 hands-on first look: can it compete with Moto G and Xiaomi?. The Nokia 3 is a dirt cheap 5-inch Android phone with clean software and the added spice of a sturdy build quality... Nokia 5 hands-on preview: bouncing back on stock Android. The Nokia 5 is crafted out of a single sheet of anodized aluminum that can be painted in Silver White, Matte Black, Tempered Blue and Copper White colors, so it joins the ranks of premium chassis phones in its class like the Moto G5 Plus or most every Xiaomi handset. The smooth metal body is a looker, especially in the blue or red hues, but it feels a bit slippery in the hand, so we'd advise a case on that puppy. Other than that, the phone is well-made, with no gaps or creaks all around, and with solid, easy to press buttons that give good tactile feedback. The phone carries a 5.2-inch HD display, which is nothing to write home about in terms of resolution, but has good viewing angles, and no visible slant to the overly cold or warm side of the color spectrum.

more ... more .... more ... more .... Nokia 3310 (2017) hands-on preview: Is it worthy of the legendary name?. Nokia 3310 (2017) hands-on preview: Is it worthy of the legendary name?. by Milen Yanachkov. Tags :. Nokia - Nokia + Hands-on - Hands-on + MWC2017 - MWC2017 +. Originally introduced way back in September of 2000, the Nokia 3310 has since sold a mind-boggling 126 million units, and cemented itself in the hearts of many fans as the “best phone ever”. Thanks to its amazing durability, stellar battery life, customizable design, and, of course, the legendary Snake II, the Nokia 3310 has gained a cult following like no other phone before or since. Really, we can’t stress enough how much of a big deal the 3310 was for mobile phones back in the year 2000. It may seem funny to some of our younger readers, but at launch, the 3310 offered many rarely seen features, such as a calculator, a stopwatch, reminders, and SMS text messages three times the then-current standard – a staggering 459 characters! The Nokia 3310 is a legend that will forever remain in our collective memory as one of the best phones ever. In fact, if anyone had asked us a couple of months ago whether we would like a new 3310, a successor to the legend, we would have answered negatively, for no device — past, present or future — could ever do these four digits justice. Alas, no one asked us, and HDM Global is now bringing back the 3310 from a long and well-deserved retirement. Nokia 3310 Yes, it isn’t the NEW Nokia 3310, or the 2017 Nokia 3310, it’s just… Nokia 3310. So, apart from bearing the legendary name of the original, what does this new phone have to offer? Design At first glance, the new Nokia 3310 looks similar to its predecessor – it retains the iconic oval outline of its older brother, has a similar whitish border around the screen , and its keypad is almost a carbon copy of the old one in terms of shape and ergonomics. However, when held, the new Nokia 3310 reveals itself as decidedly lighter and a lot thinner than the original. It also doesn’t feel anywhere nearly as sturdy as its venerable predecessor. Although we’re not doubting that the new Nokia 3310 would be able to survive its fare share of drops, it comes off as a bit hollow and a tad too plasticky. The new Nokia 3310 ditches the bidirectional navigation button of the original, in favor of the four-directional “square” button we’ve seen on Nokia feature phones over the better part of the last decade. It’s neither very comfortable to use, nor is it very precise. As far as the keypad goes, it is somewhat on the soft side, with some, but not great, feedback when typing. As we said in the beginning, the original Nokia 3310 was famous for its swappable Xpress-On front and back covers. Well, there’s none of that in the new 3310. Although it comes in a variety of colors (red, yellow, blue, and gray), the new Nokia offer nothing in the way of customization, with only its back cover being removable for providing access to the battery. Software & interface The user interface of the new Nokia 3310 bares no resemblance to that of the original, which is something that didn’t surprise us one bit. The original 3310’s horizontally scrolling menu has been substituted by a cookie-cutter Series 30 interface with a 3 x 3 icon grid. As far as the pre-installed software goes, you have everything you’d expect from a phone like that, including a rudimentary web browser and an app store, though their functionality is severely limited by some of the phone’s technical shortcomings that we will be getting into in a moment.. The new 3310 is decidedly thinner than the original. The new Nokia 3310 comes with only one game pre-loaded, and yes, it is Snake, but it isn’t the original. It is a colorful 2D re-imagining of Snake II, developed by Gameloft, that is also more forgiving and smoother to control than the original. Unfortunately, none of the other classic 3310 games have made the transition, meaning that you won’t be blasting aliens in Space Impact or playing Bantumi on the new 3310.. That's right folks, Snake is back! But it's quite different from the original. On the upside, the phone comes with a lot of classic Nokia ringtones pre-loaded. All of them are polyphonic, which can either be considered an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on your point of view (and the thickness of your nostalgia goggles). There are no twangy, ear-piercing, monophonic ringtones like the ones you would find on an original 3310. Hardware, camera and other features Battery The new Nokia 3310 has a 1200 mAh battery, which may not sound like a lot, but it’s actually capable of providing around 22 hours of talk time and a staggering 30 days of stand-by. To put things into perspective, that’s about twice as much as the original 3310 on both counts! That’s perfect for a phone that’s likely to sit in your glove box. Camera The new Nokia 3310 has a 2MP primary camera with an LED flash and no selfie camera. The rear-facing shooter can take stills and record video. That’s about as much as we can say about it. Internal storage and playback capabilities The phone comes equipped with 16 MB of storage, which can thankfully be expanded to 32 GB via the SD card slot. The phone also plays video and MP3 files, and has a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Conclusion The new Nokia 3310 has no WiFi, no 3G, no GPS, no front-facing camera, no high-resolution display. It is not a 3310 in the sense that it tries to be groundbreaking and revolutionary like the original, it is a 3310 just because HMD Global says so. It doesn't do for the mobile world of today what the original did 17 years ago, but instead relies on its name to garner attention. The new 3310 is just a regular Nokia feature phone, crammed into a shell that bares merely a passing resemblance to the design of the original 3310. If you are in the market for a cheap backup phone with amazing battery life, then you should absolutely consider the €49 Nokia 3310. Otherwise, even if you are on a powerful nostalgia trip right now, the new Nokia 3310 is not worthy of your attention, time, and money.. New Nokia 3310 camera turns out better than Galaxy S7 camera: an unbiased comparison. The original Nokia 3310 from 2000 didn't have a camera, but if it did, we're sure it'd have been rad. Fast-forward to 2017, though, and there's hardly a phone out there tha doesn't come with some sort of a snapper built into it. Good thing, then, that the brand spanking new 3310 from 2017 has one, and of the fancy-schmancy 2 megapixels at that! So we thought... maybe you guys would be interested in feasting your eyes on some real-life camera samples straight from this glorious shooter? You got it!.

Nokia 3310 (2017) hands-on preview: Is it worthy of the legendary name?. HMD Global has brought the Nokia 3310 back from the dead.

Nokia 3 hands-on first look: can it compete with Moto G and Xiaomi?. The Nokia 3 is a dirt cheap 5-inch Android phone with clean software and the added spice of a sturdy build quality... Nokia 5 hands-on preview: bouncing back on stock Android. The Nokia 5 is crafted out of a single sheet of anodized aluminum that can be painted in Silver White, Matte Black, Tempered Blue and Copper White colors, so it joins the ranks of premium chassis phones in its class like the Moto G5 Plus or most every Xiaomi handset. The smooth metal body is a looker, especially in the blue or red hues, but it feels a bit slippery in the hand, so we'd advise a case on that puppy. Other than that, the phone is well-made, with no gaps or creaks all around, and with solid, easy to press buttons that give good tactile feedback. The phone carries a 5.2-inch HD display, which is nothing to write home about in terms of resolution, but has good viewing angles, and no visible slant to the overly cold or warm side of the color spectrum. The Nokia 5 also comes with the contemporary USB-C port at the bottom, and a physical home button (no finger scanner, though), making it a nice mix of the modern and the nostalgic trends....
