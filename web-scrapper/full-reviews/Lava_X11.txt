Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time 16.66 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Talk time (3G) 10.50 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

The smartphone has been confirmed for a Marshmallow update. Lava X11 Announced with 5-Inch HD Display, 2GB RAM, Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. A quad-core CPU and 2GB RAM. Lava Mobile is extremely active in India, as the company has already launched at least a dozen Android smartphones in the last few weeks.. One of the many devices that have recently flooded the Indian market is Lava X11. This is a mid-range smartphone that doesn't impress through specs, so it's probably its design that will attract more customers.. According to a new report , Lava X11 will be available for purchase in India in both Crystal Blue and White with Gold color variants.. Customers will be able to pick this one up from all major retailers across the country for Rs 7,999 ($115 / €105) outright.. Aside from its design, another selling point of the Lava X11 could be the fact that the Indian OEM promised to offer an Android 6.0 Marshmallow update this year.. Lava X11 ships with Android 5.1.1 Lollipop operating system right out of the box. It also sports a standard 5-inch HD (720p) capacitive touchscreen display and a 2,500 mAh battery that hasn't been rated by the manufacturer.. The mid-range smartphone is powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core processor, possibly provided by MediaTek, coupled with 2GB of RAM and just 8GB of internal memory. The good news is Lava X11 comes with microSD card slot for memory expansion.. Other highlights of the phone include an 8-megapixel rear camera, a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, dual-SIM and 4G LTE support, as well as Bluetooth 4.0, microUSB 2.0 and GPS with AGPS support.. “Even in markets where 4G services have not yet been launched by the operators, consumers want to opt for 4G devices to stay future ready. With affordable 4G devices at multiple price points, we aim to fuel the aspirations of the ever evolving mobile consumer.”. ”These devices have been designed to deliver an unmatched 4G hardware experience in terms of faster browsing, downloading, streaming and video calling,” said Navin Chawla, Chief Operating Officer, Lava International.. # Lava X11 # Lava Mobile # Lava smartphone # Lava update # dual-SIM smartphone.
