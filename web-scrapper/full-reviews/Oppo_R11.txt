Both its hardware and software are too Apple-esque.. The Bottom Line It's not the easiest phone to get hold of, but Oppo's R11 is another feasible, affordable alternative to Apple and Samsung.. Affordable phones are getting better and better, so there's never been a better time. to pony up for a pricey iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S.

The company makes a big deal over the new R11's selfie camera, which clocks in at 20 megapixels. Those extra pixels didn't seem to make that much of a difference in selfie quality, though my colleague Claire Reilly loved the beautifying software. Instead, the real stars of the show are the dual 20- and 16-megapixel cameras at the back.. Oppo R11 sports dashing good looks. The phone sells in China for 2,999 yuan and the official price in Australia is AU$649. If you're in the US or UK, you can import it for around $440 or £340. That's around $300 (or £300) or so less than you'll pay for the similarly sized iPhone 7 Plus ( $891.02 at Amazon.com ) or Samsung Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ). Despite the smaller price tag, the camera stands up to the shooters on those high-end phones .. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $530 Buy. $300 Buy.

Almost all-day battery life Responsive even with multiple apps Decent camera output Affordable price. Micro USB only Less than stellar low-light camera performance No image stabilization. While Xiaomi has the lion’s share of the Chinese market and fellow Chinese OEM OnePlus making waves in the international scene, OPPO remains undoubted and produces a steady stream of smartphones every year. A stream that, in all honesty, has accumulated into a rushing river that threatens to flood the smartphone market with nearly indistinguishable devices. Save for a few standouts, like the recently launched F3 and F3 Plus, OPPO’s smartphone nearly look identical not just with each other but with other brands as well. With the OPPO R11, however, the company seems to be ready to break out of that mold. While still not exactly premium smartphone material, the OPPO R11 takes a step forward in joining the big leagues.. It’s almost pointless to talk about OPPO’s smartphone designs. Nearly every model will inevitably be compared with and mistaken for an iPhone at first glance. There are differences, of course, but they are too subtle to be noticed except by those who take the time to look deeper and longer.. The similarities with an iPhone is less blatant in the R11 that it was in the F3, which, in turn, felt like a step backward aesthetically compared to its bigger F3 Plus sibling. For example, the antenna lines follow the same arc pattern as the iPhone 7 but are less visible, taking on almost the same color as the rest of the back, and are composed of two lines each. Despite having less lines, OPPO still boasts of the exact same, or even better, signal reception.. The back is also subtly curved, unlike an iPhone. It also curves at all edges. These two factors contribute to a better grip and more confidence that the phone won’t easily slip out from your hand, despite having an all metal body.. It’s still pretty much a specs race among Chinese manufacturers, but one that has a slightly different spin. OEMs are racing to offer the best specs at a price, with price sometimes being the more critical factor. In most cases, like in the OPPO F3, that meant utilizing a usually cheaper MediaTek processor. With the R11, however, OPPO has decided to go with a Qualcomm. Not the highest Snapdragon, mind, but still the latest as far as its higher mid-range series of chips go. Somewhat ironically, this Snapdragon 660 and the R11’s 1080p resolution are probably the only specs that don’t match up to high-end standards.. • Operating System: Android 7.1, ColorOS 3.1. • CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 660. • Storage: 64 GB, expandable up to 256 GB. • Display: 5.5-inch 1920x1080n AMOLED. • Main Camera: 20 MP f/2.6 + 16 MP f/1.7 wide-angle, 2x zoom. • Secondary Camera: 20 MP f/2.0. • Battery: 3,000 mAh, VOOC Flash Charge. Honestly, the Full HD display isn’t really a big thing, at least not for OPPO’s core market. Very few of the major OEMs, not even Xiaomi, has completely jumped onto the QHD train. Their customers don’t seem to mind either. These users prefer a longer battery life over extra pixels they may not even notice, especially with majority of online content mostly still averaging at 1080p. It’s a tradeoff users are willing to make for an overall better experience.. OPPO does make up for it by using an AMOLED panel, still a rarity with OEMs aside from Samsung. This adds to the OPPO R11’s longer battery life, since OLED uses up less power overall, especially when display black pixels. AMOLED also has the distinction of producing richer and more vibrant colors, something we could attest to ourselves. AMOLED also uses no power when displaying a black screen, which makes it particularly conducive for always-on displays and features.. In contrast to the movement happening in the mainstream market, OPPO and its kin haven’t been quick to join the bezel-less bandwagon just yet. The OPPO R11 still has bezels all around, especially top and bottom. OPPO does boast of how thin it is at the sides, only 1.66 mm wide, but they’re still there and still very visible.. The most remarkable thing about the OPPO R11 isn’t it’s all too familiar design or its bright and bezeled display. OK, maybe price does factor into it. But when taking the R11 for a spin, its most impressive feat is how well it performed in the field, so to speak. It it performed admirably well for a smartphone that might not exactly fit the “premium phone” mold.. A lot of that has to do with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660. Release just last month, this, along with the Snapdragon 630, is Qualcomm’s first mid-range processor to use its own Kryo cores, putting it in the same group as its Snapdragon 821 and 835, albeit at lower clock speeds. This meant harnessing the power of Qualcomm’s Spectra ISP for dual camera support, its Adreno GPU for graphics prowess, and support for 2×2 MU-MIMO 802.11ac Wi-Fi, among other things.. Together with an ample 4 GB of RAM, 6 GB if you get the R11 Plus model, that practically meant smooth sailing even with a good number of apps open. Make no mistake, it’s not going to hold a candle to this year’s high-end processors, be it a Snapdragon, Kirin, or even a Helio. But it comes pretty darn close when it comes to practical, every day use.. And for the benchmark fans, here’s a peek at the numbers coming from Geekbench as well as AnTuTu. While definitely not the highest, the Snapdragon in the OPPO R11 nearly comes close to last year’s flagships and, at least in one case, even surpasses them. Definitely a glowing testament to Qualcomm’s and OPPO’s achievement.. Performance, however, is the only standard by which consumers measure their smartphones these days. battery life has become a major point of discussion as well as a major pain point. The 3,000 mAh battery in the OPPO R11 might not seem much, but considering other factors involved, it does seem adequate.. The Snapdragon 600 series has been notable for its nearly perfect balance of performance and power efficiency, which is the Snapdragon 625 in particular has been a favorite among mid-range devices. The improvements in the 630 and 660 promise to prolong battery life even more. Then there’s the fact that OPPO R11 doesn’t have as much pixels to push in its 1080p screen. An AMOLED type panel also contributes some battery-saving features, though sometimes only marginal, depending on what’s on display most of the time.. With average mixed used, we got around 19 hours of battery life in a day. Definitely not the 2-day life that Sony used to brag about, but still gives you enough time to postpone charging until you get to bed. You will indeed charge it almost every day, but even then OPPO tries to make it as painless as possible. The phone features the company’s own proprietary VOOC Flash Charge that promises 2 hours of talk time with only a 5 minute charge time. While that might indeed sound like an ideal compromise, it does come at a price. One, you are beholden to OPPO’s chargers, as no other charger or power bank advertises support for VOOC. Second, you will be missing out on the USB-C fun, as VOOC technology itself seems to be stuck using micro USB connection for now.. Unlike the OPPO F3 Plus, the OPPO R11 doesn’t have some fancy shmancy camera gimmick to rely on. All eyes, then, are on the dual rear cameras. In a bit of a role reversal, the “lesser” sensor, the one with 16 megapixels, is considered the regular one with its f/1.7 aperture. The higher 20 megapixel sensors, on the other hand, has an f/2.6 lens and is used for telephoto shots. There is no extreme wide-angle here, no monochrome sensor either. It’s definitely an outlier in this year’s dual camera arena, but it does have one ace up its sleeve: the 2X optical zoom is performs very well without loss of detail. That is, if you get the lighting right.. The OPPO R11’s cameras are representative of almost every OPPO smartphone we’ve reviewed so far. They are good, but not outstanding. They produce good photos under ideal lighting conditions but immediately show their weakness in poorly lit scenes. It’s not terrible, mind you, especially if you use the correct f/1.7 camera. Noise, however, is visible and wouldn’t pass professional tastes. And, sadly, there is no image stabilization to speak of.. OPPO tries to balance this through its camera app. As seems to be the trend these days, it offers advanced manual controls for those who prefer to tweak every setting to perfection, or as much as they can given the camera’s limitations. The app is also fast and the shutter quick so, provided you have a steady hand and good lighting, you’re assured that you won’t miss a beat.. Despite being alone, the front camera is no pushover. It has a 20 megapixel sensor, definitely one of the highest on that side of the phone. The lens has an f/2.0 aperture, which, again, is OK but not spectacular, especially in dim light. With the right conditions, it still makes for a great selfie.. And, of course, there are the bokeh and “Beauty” modes that makes every look pretty, even though the little guy below definitely doesn’t need any embellishing.. OPPO is definitely one of the underestimated brands in the market, especially in the international scene. Its “Selfie Expert” F series have mostly delivered on that promise, even if there’s still a lot of room for improvement. With the OPPO R11, the company takes a step closer to joining the big boy’s arena, but still keeps one foot secure in the “affordable” ring. It’s definitely not perfect and nowhere near being a premium smartphone in terms of features. But with the right mix of specs and price, it comes close to being an everyday driver for the masses.. If you’re looking for gorgeous design, professional cameras, and blazing fast speeds, you have to look elsewhere and be prepared to spend a fortune. But if you’re in the market for an affordable performer that does OK without being over the top in features and in price, then the OPPO R11 should definitely be in your list of candidates..

Samsung Galaxy S9 vs Google Pixel 2. When does the Oppo R11 come out? Available in Australia from 7 August 2017.. What’s new about the Oppo R11? Snapdragon 660 CPU, Dual lens camera, full metal body. How much will the Oppo R11 cost? On sale for $649 outright or on contract through Vodafone, Virgin Mobile and Woolworths Mobile.. Chinese phone maker Oppo has enjoyed considerable success in the outright phone sales market in Australia with a range of Android phones typically priced in the budget to mid-range price point. Its R series phones are effectively its "flagship" range, although it has never particularly played in the kinds of price spaces that the flagships from companies such as Apple or Samsung have done.. As such, the R11 is the continuation of the kinds of phones we've seen previously in the form of the Oppo R9s. Solid workhorses with a focus on camera quality over other aspects of the Android experience, in other words.. Oppo has opted to use Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 660 SoC on the Oppo R11 and larger Oppo R11 Plus, alongside 4GB of RAM. The Snapdragon 660 sits in an interesting position for Qualcomm, because while the Snapdragon 835 (as found in phones such as the HTC U11) is still its hero silicon, the Snapdragon 660 is a mid-range play that's positioned for phones that need a reasonable amount of power.. The idea here is that they're fine for everyday users without being noticeably laggy for most uses, so while the R11 might not top the benchmark charts, it should compare well against other handsets in its specific price range.. Oppo has invested heavily in its camera technology, pinpointing it as a key differentiator for its camera lines. For the Oppo R11, it has opted for a front-facing 20MP sensor, as well as dual 16MP and 20MP rear lenses with 2x optical zoom. Dual lens setups from phone manufacturers typically add a single feature to the secondary lens.. For LG's G6, for example, the secondary lens offers widescreen capabilities, while Huawei's P10 and P10 Plus use a secondary monochrome lens for sharper images. Oppo's R11 adds 2x optical zoom to the camera equation, so it's a closer match to Apple's iPhone 7 Plus in this respect.. Oppo uses its own proprietary fast charging standard, dubbed VOOC, which provides up to a 75% battery charge in just 30 minutes of charging time. You do have to use the provided charger to utilise that fast charging, although the R11 should at least take a trickle charge from other adaptors.. The R11 will charge via standard microUSB, where many newer mid-range handsets are starting to switch to USB C connectivity. On the plus side there, while it will charge more slowly from other adaptors, if you have an older plug or you're borrowing someone else's Android adaptor, it should plug in perfectly.. Oppo is yet to particularly dive into the world of water resistance, with no announced specific water resistance rating for the Oppo R11. Like most smartphones this means that it should be workable if it's rained on, but it's inadvisable to submerge the phone unless you feel like buying another one rather quickly.. Oppo will release the Oppo R11 in Australia on 7 August 2017.. Oppo's market positioning for all of its phones has focused strongly on affordability, with the R series phones sitting atop of its price range. The Oppo R11 will retail outright in Australia for $649.. Oppo has managed to get the Oppo R11 ranged through a wide variety of carriers, so when it comes to market, it will be available on contract terms through Virgin Mobile, Vodafone and Woolworths Mobile.. We've had the chance to put both the early Chinese model and the locally available model of the Oppo R11 through its paces. While it's not perfect, we were overall very happy with the phone that Oppo can deliver at this price point.. If you've been hanging out for a dual lens camera phone at a mid-range price, wait no more. Oppo's R11 is a generally impressive iPhone clone with a few tricks of its own. While battery life could be better, this is a highly impressive handset and a great value option.. You can read our full review of the Oppo R11 here .. Was this content helpful to you?.

This phone with Project Spectrum (AOSP) would be fantastic and a must buy â with ColorOS 3.1 it is unfortunately an avoid at all costs.

Source: Hardware Zone Finally, at S$699, the R11 is quite pricey for a mid-range phone and its set of features. For S$70 more you can get the 6GB RAM/64GB OnePlus 5, which has a very similar dual rear camera setup, looks almost exactly the same, and has a much more powerful flagship-level Snapdragon 835 processor. It also has a UI that's closer to stock Android instead of the iOS clone you get with the R11. Alternatively, the Xiaomi Mi 6 is available for about S$130 LESS than the R11 (export units on Lazada) and also has a dual camera setup (with the added benefit of optical image stabilization) and a Snapdragon 835 processor.

Hands on with the OPPO R11 Source: Android Authority So there you have it for this quick look at the OPPO R11! The R11 looks to be a very promising mid-range smartphone, with what should be a great camera experience being its biggest USP. While the R11âs camera-first concept is certainly exciting, unfortunately, it is unclear if the R11 will ever make to markets other than China. Of course, many are claiming the R11 is the blueprint for the upcoming OnePlus 5, which looks very similar but with some upgraded internals.

Leaked pictures show the Oppo R11 with a very iPhone-like dual-lens camera. Update: Added leaked pictures that may show the Oppo R11 in three different color schemes. Oppo is one of the top four major smartphone brands in China, with a history of selling both reasonably priced, attractive phones, and more expensive, quirky devices that catch our eye. It also sells its smartphones internationally. Now, it’s about to release a new phone called the Oppo R11, and it will continue the company’s tradition of producing devices with strong camera features. Here’s what we know about it so far.. Oppo has always made great looking phones, although many do share a distinct likeness to Apple’s iPhone, so what will it do with the R11? A series of leaked images give us a great look at the possible design, and once again, the iPhone influence is clear, especially in the front panel and the rear camera lens housing. We can see three colors: A black model, a gold model, and a pink version, which will probably be referred to as rose gold.. Before the leaked images, Oppo teased us with a video which actually revealed almost all the phone’s design, which better highlighted. some very distinct design touches unique to the R11. For example, take a look at the train-track style antenna bands, and the beautifully curved rear panel that falls away at the edge. However, the dual-lens rear camera and its prominent hump, is pure iPhone 7 Plus.. The design seen in the images and video matches leaked pictures of the device published earlier on the. Black and gold color schemes are on display in the video, while the leaked still images show only a gold version.. The leaks all point to the Oppo R11 having one of the biggest smartphone trends at the moment, a dual-lens camera. While Oppo has used dual-lenses on a front camera before, this would be the first time it has done so on the rear of its phones. first hinted about the camera, and about the device’s. The camera is likely to be comprised of both 20- and 16-megapixel lenses, according to a report from The Android Soul. It is accompanied by another 20-megapixel shooter at the front. Oppo has been showing off the selfie camera’s ability through its Weibo account , confirming the 20-megapixel count, and concentrating on how it can take clear images in high resolution. It hasn’t said anything about the rear camera’s ability yet.. When will the Oppo R11 be announced? A post made on the company’s official Weibo channel showed a teaser poster with a June 10 date on it, and the accompanying text says the R11 will be revealed at 8:30 p.m. China local time on that day. The week before this, Oppo added a teaser poster confirming the device’s name, and that it will have a dual-lens rear camera. The price and release date aren’t known at this time.. Will the Oppo R11 be a powerhouse, or more closely match phones such as the Oppo F3? Leaked spec details from Weibo,. say for the standard R11, we are looking at a. Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 system-on-chip mated to. 4GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in storage. It’s expected to be joined by a larger Plus model which bumps that memory up to 6GB.. Both phones are expected to run Oppo’s ColorOS 3.1 based on Android 7.1, the latest and greatest version of Google’s operating system.. In terms of the display, the regular R11 sports a. The Plus model features the same resolution, but the panel is a bit larger, measuring 6 inches. A similar approach has been taken with the batteries — the R11 receives a 3,000mAh unit, while the R11 Plus’ is slightly beefier, at 4,000mAh. Other rumors say the batteries will be a 2,900mAh cell and a 3880mAh cell.. Oppo is having quite a year. The company recently launched the F3 Plus , which was generally well received — although it was not perfect. One of our main complaints was that it featured an older version of Android. If the leaked specs for the R11 are to be believed, it seems that Oppo has learned from that mistake.. We will keep this story updated as we hear more about the upcoming Oppo R11..

3.9 from 24 reviews. Your trust is our top concern. Companies can't alter or remove reviews from ProductReview.com.au.. Very good compared with old phone. 4 out of 5 ,. Do not agree that some of the instructions you need to use are written in a pale green. Would not be able to use if I did not have a pair of reading glasses. It means I now have to carry a set of glasses which I did not have to do previously with the smaller Samsung.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. Bought this phone for my mom. Takes wonderful photos and is up to date. Quite a large phone so its great for older people. I like the feel of the phone in my hand, it doesn't feel cheap. Small bezeels on the screen make it look like a high end phone.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Excellent for price value and use. 5 out of 5 ,. Bought this phone a year ago have always been an iphone user but had a lot of issues. Went oppo and the screen is massive it has excellent battery life and charge. it fixes itself with its own virus protection when it thinks its found something. so easy to use, excellent camera too. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. My age is a 55 year old woman and I am liking it. For me i take calls, make calls, send texts, search the web and have aps as well as facebook - so all these features are very suitable and of great quality and standard. It is a great size, pretty sleek, the camera takes some amazing shots, the ring tone is loud enough to hear at the bottom of my handbag. The battery life seems to be long lasting at this stage. When talking on the telephone, it seems to be quite clear and succinct. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. This phone looks beautiful, is easy to use and has a great camera. It is also a great price compared to others on the market. Comes with a clear protective case and a screen saver already fitted. I only have slight freezing issues when trying to turn the Bluetooth on sometime.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. After having the Oppo R11 for a few months it a great phone. The phone has great camera quality, fast cpu, 4gb of ram and a 3500mAh battery. The Oppo R11's particularly outstanding features are high quality camera and the long lasting battery life. A major down size for me is the ColorOS which is the operating system which Oppo uses.This is because things such as; non-visible notifications on the notification bar and the limited ability to customise the phone for example changing font. However, if you are a simple phone user this phone is a great price for its features.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. It's not my first time to buy oppo products and every time I just feel like I can see the improvement of the product step by step. Very nice experience using this phone. Especially the battery power and huge storage is very important for taking photos and download musics.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. This phone is a potential iPhone killer!. 4 out of 5 ,. I was in the market for a new replacement phone for my iPhone 4s when it battery finally died out last July and was looking to buy an iPhone 7. The price was too steep judging on the fact that i'd have to dish to $1000+ for a phone that looked identical to 3 previous releases. Then I stumbled upon the Oppo r11 which was at the time advertised at $599 at JB HI-FI which for me was a complete steal and saved me from further dispensing out my hard earned dollars. Upon doing further research I found that the Oppo r11 had a much better specced camera and bigger screen but for only half the price for an iPhone 8. Out of the box it felt glorious down to its sleek black edge to edge bezels and smooth curves. On the rear was a carbon fibre like material that was of a solid sturdy construction unlike anything I've experience with the iPhone. On startup I was greeted by a friendly oppo chime and was pleasantly surprised that it was running android 7. Opening native applications was a breeze with its blazingly fast cpu and 4GB of ram which made multi-tasking games to browsing youtube a blast. For the past year that I've been using the oppo r11 never had I experience a day that I needed to charge the phone twice as it's 4000 milliamp battery was more than enough for the daily grind. I was extremely pleased to see a sub-$600 phone equal and even best an iPhone which makes this product the more compelling purchase for anyone looking for a reliable yet pleasantly rewarding device.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Good value phone for the price. 4 out of 5 ,. Took some getting used to but now that I have it's a good little phone for the money. Biggest pain is that it doesn't automatically show notifications ( new emails etc) you can go in and change this it's quite fiddly but there are a few good tutorials if you search on Google. Battery life is very good but anything would be compared to my previous phone. it charges very quickly when you use the genuine charger but if you're using another branded charger it's quite slow. To be honest the main reason I purchased this phone it was because the camera had excellent reviews I have to say they were right. I'm very impressed with the quality of photos that come from both of normal camera and front facing.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. I bought this phone after my old one stopped working and it's been one of the best decisions. It's very affordable and it definitely a budget phone that includes everything else that your Samsung/ iPhone has in it, just cheaper! It's got a nice sleep design which I love and I find it very user friendly.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Great camera but sometimes blocks notifications. 4 out of 5 ,. The cameras both front and back are amazing quality and the phone itself looks and feels like an apple. Only problem is some notifications doesn't seem to pop up on the screen. Other then that great price for a budget phone. Works like an apple as well. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a budget phone. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. This is one of the best I bought so far. The battery was so good that you can't believe. I never faced any issue with this phone. I bought this for my wife and she loved this too. Guys don't waste money on expensive crap. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. a few weeks ago i finally decided to replace my old Samsung galaxy s5 for a upgrade and after doing some extensive research online i came to this phone. It operates super smooth and clocks around the same performance as most apple phones. It runs super smooth when using my google cardboard and runs most game at a steady pace on high graphics. The battery life can last a full day of heavy usage and the VOOC charging port and cable charges the phone from dead to full in 45 minuets. the only bummer to it is you don't get the icons at the top of your screen when you get an notification but you can just swipe downwards check them anyway. Overall i this phone is an awesome daily driver and would recommend it to any one looking for a new phone.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. I purchased my Oppo R11 3 months ago and so far, I'm pretty happy with it. The quality of the photos and videos taken using the rear and front cameras were pretty good. I also like the multitasking/split screen feature as I can watch youtube videos and browse at the same time. The price is reasonable; the phone is light-weight and stylish. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 1 out of 5 ,. I thought I was buying another android phone (and yes it runs on android) but that's about where it ends. There's now message bar at the top, you can't see your messages or any missed activity until you actually switch the phone on and it takes 2 actions to close them (you just can't sweep aside). If you search the Internet you'll get the impression that this handset has fantastic specifications. And indeed in some ways it has, large memory, a seemingly good camera though the reviews differ greatly. I've been a dual Sim user this thing in Australia only comes with a single Sim even though there is a tray for 2 Sims. This made it on usable from me. The colour OS operating system doesn't allow you to put widgets on the home screen or if it does it must be really complicated – there is no app tray and there is no operating manual for the phone (December 17). If you're familiar with Samsung or straightforward Google android do not buy this phone.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. The look of an iPhone and the freedom of Android. 4 out of 5 ,. Build quality is excellent and very much in the spirit of the iPhone 7 plus. Camera is excellent and takes very decent pics. Finger print reader is the fastest ive ever used. Runs its own version of Android which has an iPhone type experience. Has some minor flaws or quirks such as not being able to swipe away notifications first go. Blue tooth can be hit and miss sometimes. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. I bought the Oppo R11 as a replacement for my Samsung G5. I am very happy with it, it does everything I want it to do and the camera is truly impressive. The display is crystal clear and I find operating it a breeze. Originally I was going to by the R9 but office works no longer stocked them as they have been superseded by the R11. I am happy with this as the R11 is a much better phone.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 1 person found this helpful, do you?. 1 out of 5 ,. Buying this phone its gamble!! my has had a slow wifi problem from day 1 ,it downloads at 230 kb but as soon as I turn the airplane mode on it downloads at 2-4 megs!! its a joke , oppo Australia keeps telling me a oppo technician will call me back lol (called three times never happened) I received an email from vodafail today confirming they have found a fault on the second handset I have returned now, and the idiots want to replace it with yet another r11 piece of crap even though I have offered to buy a more expensive phone (Samsung s8 iPhone 8) just to reassure how rubbish their customer service is. MY RECOMENDATION IS DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!! DO NOT SING UP WITH VODAPHONE!!. Among other problems it wont pick up my bebop 2 drone wifi signal that even my daughters $88 lenovo tablet and just every other device I got does and you cant look through pics on car sales it really is a garbage phone.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 1 person found this helpful, do you?. 4 out of 5 ,. This affordable phones are getting better and better. Very happy with is touch screen performance. The finger print recognition is awesome, event it is faster than iphone 8. The picture quality of the camera is very very good, even the font face camera. It is famous for is camera and its true. The battery life is little bit in downside.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. affordable mid-range phone with a high end camera. 5 out of 5 ,. Oppo used to be famous as a apple knockoff but in a couple of years has turned itself from a clone to a master of classic apple style phones something that apple itself has failed to recapture with the x. The performance of this phone is excellent in everything but demanding 3d games with lots of fps and frame skip drops and hitches. Outside of gaming however the r11 improves on the previous models in every way. My only real complaint with the phone is the headphone jack design it's too recessed but at least it has one. Also for 600aud+ usb c would have been better but the micro USB is well designed and the charger is very quick. But the statqr feature of this phone is the camera and 4k video recording which both look amazing and very responsive UI help the phone both look and feel twice the price. If only other countries got this but it's early days for oppo. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. a telephone call is visible registered but no sound is heard.

OPPO R11 – A Great Mid-Range Phone. Great Camera, Premium, all-metal design, Good battery life, VOOC fast charging, Expandable storage. Cons - Micro-USB is outdated, 3.5mm jack has limited compatibility, No NFC. OPPO has released the R11 to follow-up to the R9s smartphone. It is the Chinese manufacturer's current flagship. The brand has produced a steady stream of fairly decent smartphones. An extraordinary midranger, the OPPO R11 is a premium-looking smartphone that threatens the position of other tech mobile giant in the market with its state-of-the-art features especially the cameras.. OPPO R11 is almost the same as its predecessors in terms of physical features. The device still sports the same unibody design as the R9s with a matte metal case on the back and a white colored front. It comes with a 5.5-inches screen with 1920 x 1080 pixels (401pp1) resolution AMOLED display and a capacitive fingerprint sensor under it. The bottom frame of the device holds a 3.5mm headphone jack, speaker and a USB-B port not the new USB-C port that most premium devices are now using. The device is light and slim weighing 150 grams and with a dimension of 154.5 x 74.8 x 6.9 mm which makes it thinner than the iPhone 7. Unlike other premium smartphones, OPPO is not waterproof which is a major flaw of the device.. The OPPO R11 comes with a 20MP camera on the front and a dual camera set-up on the rear which includes a 16MO IMX398 regular sensor with a f/1.7 lens and the other is a 20MP IMX376 sensor with f/2.6 telephoto lens. When both the lenses are combined, they are able to offer 2x optical zoom capabilities with image processing by the Qualcomm Spectra ISP. As a result., all the photos produced by the OPPO R11 are impressive, clear and has a very vibrant color scheme.. The R11 is the first smartphone to feature the Snapdragon 660 chipset. It offers a powerful octa-core processor housing the company's custom Kryo 260 cores on which four of the cores are ticking at 2.2GHz and the other four at 1.8GHz. This comes with a 4GB RAM and an Adreno 512 GPU should give your device the power it needs to run most tasks.. OPPO R11 works on a 4GB RAM. Internal storage comes in at 64GB. You can extend its external storage to a maximum of 128 B via microSD slots.. This device runs on a Non-removable Li-Po 3200 mAh battery and it supports VOOC fast charging.. OPPO R11 runs ColorOS 3.1, based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat and updated with a more attractive interface and a host of security features. The user interface resembles Apple's iOS which means swiping up and down will bring up the notification panel and quick settings panel respectively, and also the task switcher is similar to the iPhone's.. The Philippines remains as the fastest-growing market for smartphones in Southeast Asia. That's why all the mobile companies are taking advantage of the country as a "selfie" capital of the world with the introduction of each brand's flagship high-end smartphones especially made for shooting. For this reason, OPPO considered the country as an essential market in the mobile device industry. Their products are always popular as ever. And with the release of R11, it could bring another big milestone for the company. As of now, there's no availability of the device in the Philippines and no word yet when it will be offered in the country.. User Review : 2 Reviews. 20k no box charger or headset.

OPPO R11 Review – Design & Features. OPPO R11 Review – Color OS 3.1. OPPO R11 Review – Earlier this year, we’ve had the OPPO R9s Plus , a mid-range flagship smartphone from OPPO that offers a large display for content consumption.. To those who own the OPPO R9s or looking for a smaller display, OPPO has just released their new flagship Android phone, the OPPO R11. And this time, it comes with the major feature that I want every phone nowadays to have: Portrait mode (with depth of field / bokeh effect).. Portrait mode definitely takes smartphone photography to the next level. Using clever algorithms, a phone takes a shot from a dual-lens camera to create believable depth-of-field effects, like what you get from a DSLR camera with a good lens. I first came upon the Portrait mode feature when I had my iPhone 7 Plus and was blown away by it. Other flagship phones from different brands already have it too but I wasn’t expecting OPPO to have this in their product line. After all, smartphones with dual-lens camera are usually very costly (around AU $1,000 and above, except for the OnePlus 5).. So when the new OPPO R11 was announced with a dual-lens camera for just AU $649, I was astonished and interested to take the unit to the test.. As always, the phone comes with a screen protector already nicely installed (air bubble free!) and includes a good case.. And don’t forget OPPO’s Fast Charge technology that charges your phone quickly too with the included power charger.. Like the previous OPPO models, it is crystal clear that the OPPO R11 takes its design methodology from an Apple iPhone. Even the updated ColorOS 3.1 (on top of the Android Operating System) borrows a lot from iOS. Open the Camera app and you probably cannot differentiate it from an iPhone Camera app interface. The same goes for the Control Center (or Quick Settings) when you swipe from the bottom up.. But if that works, why bother? After all, you buy a phone for what it offers, not whether it’s a clone of something else. Design wise, OPPO R11 looks beautiful, slim (1.66m in width), very light, and premium. The antenna lines are non-intrusive, has a metal exterior with smooth curves, and feels comfortable in hand. It feels so light that my friends usually made a comment each time I handed the OPPO R11 to someone new.. Performance wise (it’s powered by Qualcomm SDM660 processor), the phone is okay and cannot compete with a high-end smartphone. All OPPO phones so far are mid-range smartphones which do not cost much, but things are not always smooth as a result, especially when you are playing games. Interacting with the Camera sometimes feels sluggish too, though not infuriating. Interacting with the phone is fine though, and apps do open quickly.. OPPO R11 has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage which makes the experience a lot better. For the price, this is awesome.. At times, it feels as if OPPO has not fully done with the ColorOS and is still experimenting around with different changes. I did have quirks with its notifications not showing up on the older OPPO devices running older ColorOS, but it seems that the problem has gone now. Every app I installed got its notifications without problems.. However, there is just a small change in the latest ColorOS 3.1 that may be hated by Android users. Normally, you can see app notifications on both your lock screen and on the top status bar (app icons). For some reason (probably to make the ColorOS looks cleaner, or to 100% mimicking iOS), OPPO takes the top status bar app notification out.. While iOS has always been like this and iPhone users are used to swiping down to see the “all notifications” screen or check the app badges, it’s something new to an Android and/or OPPO user.. OPPO R11 Camera is definitely the game changer and the main highlights of OPPO R11. It has a 20MP Front Camera and a Rear Dual-Camera (20MP + 16MP). Megapixels don’t tell how good of a quality a camera lens is, so we put the OPPO R11 Camera to the test.. As with most mid-range smartphones, taking outdoor photos or when the area is brightly lit is not a problem. In my experience, OPPO R11 camera is excellent in taking these shots, maintaining the clarity of the scene and producing satisfying results.. Check the yummy, ahem, variety of colour that the camera captured nicely on my lunch here:. The Dual Lens Camera also lets you zoom in 2x optically without loss of quality, but note that the lens has a different aperture, so will not take shots as good in a not-so-bright environment (Rear Camera: 20M?f/2.6?+16M?f/1.7)).. But what about the main bells and whistles, i.e the Portrait Mode? I’d have to say it is pretty good, almost as good as a much more expensive iPhone 7 Plus that I was using before. OPPO R11 Portrait Mode works well in most situations, though shooting objects do not always create the correct depth-of-field effect (i.e edges sometimes get blurred too).. Taking portrait shots is fun and cool, but require the scene to be decently lit.. And some official sample photos from OPPO:. If you are using an older OPPO phone and would love to get better shots with a phone’s camera, the OPPO R11 with its Portrait mode is definitely an upgrade-worthy. This is true especially if you only use the camera to post photos on a social media platform like Instagram.. As for challenging, night shots, you may want to forget about it as it’s definitely not OPPO R11’s (or any low to mid range smartphone) strongest points.. Colour gets washed out and the software tries really hard to reduce noise by over-smoothing. If you like taking lowly lit photos, you’d probably have to spend $500 or more for a higher-end smartphone for sure.. For a while, we’ve had OPPO phones that had not really changed much apart from having better performance and a few tweaks here and there.. is a game changer for OPPO by introducing an all new bells-and-whistles feature: dual cameras with enhanced bokeh effects; turning your ordinary smartphone portrait photos into professional looking ones. The results are amazingly good as well – almost as good as a much pricier iPhone 7 Plus.. But if you already own an R9s or R9s Plus and don’t really take a lot of pictures, you might want to stay with what you have for a bit longer. OPPO R11 Plus should be around the corner if you want a bigger display. And we are still waiting for OPPO’s new Super VOOC charging technology that can fully charge a 2,500mAh phione under 15 minutes. in an OPPO unit one day.. You can grab the OPPO R11 at JB Hi-Fi for AU $649 (by the time this review was written) and Australia Telcos ( Virgin. and Vodafone ) through a plan. It’s also available at Amazon ..
