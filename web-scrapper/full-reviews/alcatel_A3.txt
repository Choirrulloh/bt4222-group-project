I bought this phone as it had 16 meg of Memory and 1.5 meg of Ram as my old phone was getting slow and did not have so much internal or RAM memory.. The phone works well with the apps I use and the internet and double the speed of my old phone. However, the camera is very poor quality and takes time to focus and pictures are not good quality. Also, if I switch on GPS Location needed with some apps the battery usage is high and I would need to recharge daily.. Also, while the messaging ( Text) works well I find I have to delete whole conversations from a person rather than individual Texts.. For the price a reasonable phone for calls, Texts, and occasional internet and apps.. Rated 1 out of. All i get is 'system ui isnt responding' or the screen doesnt even know you have touched it. It puts android to shame a little. Rated 1 out of. bought this alcatela 3 on nov last year had to get it exchanged 3 times same problem and now wont let me pick different phones as power button sticks and wont light screen.

Affordable with a touch of premium. Our Alcatel A3 review finds an affordable UK smartphone that has a touch, or two, of premium features and functions, that will entice entry-level shoppers.. The Alcatel A3 has a 5” HD display (1280 x 720 pixels) and with 294 pixels per inch, this is well suited to those who enjoy playing videos or games. Content on the screen, is easily shared with wide viewing angles and visibility even under bright sunlight.. Of course, the MediaTek quad core 1.25GHz processor with 1.5GB RAM can’t compete with premium phones costing hundreds of pounds. But, in its class it performs very well indeed.. A few premium elements appear here with the Alcatel A3 sporting a metallic frame. Further character is added with a textured micro-patterned power key and a patterned cover.. This Alcatel mobile phone is neither thin nor thick at 8.6mm.. The Alcatel A3 has a 16GB memory for transferring content over from an old smartphone. Should more memory be required, then a microSD card slot is to be found and this supports cards with a value of up to 32GB.. Another premium feature appears here with the Alcatel A3 having a fingerprint sensor, positioned on the back face, underneath the camera lens. The fingerprint scanner can be used to unlock the phone, as well as being used to lock apps and photos, through the Private Mode function.. With Smart Lock , users can set up trusted devices, faces, voices and locations, which when sensed, keep the phone unlocked for convenience.. New: Alcatel Idol 5S review. The fingerprint sensor’s functionality goes beyond security, by letting up to five fingerprints to be registered for opening up to five different apps. Users can do this straight from the lock screen and one fingerprint can be set to take an instant selfie.. Alcatel has kept the pricing of the Alcatel A3 down by pre-loading Android 6.0 Marshmallow, as opposed to the later Android Nougat OS. This rendition of Android brings with it popular apps from Google like Chrome, Maps and YouTube.. There are other lesser known Google apps pre-loaded, such as the Duo video chatting app and Keep , a note taking app that supports lists, voice recordings and images.. The Alcatel A3 brings a few features of its own and one of these includes a front facing speaker that makes the most of media, such as music files played through the Google Play app. Users will also be able to make use of Turbo Download , a feature that downloads large files, of over 20MB, by using 4G and Wi-Fi at the same time, which is pretty cool.. Alcatel Idol 4 with VR Headset deals. The Alcatel A3 has a powerful 13MP camera with a LED flash for low light conditions. Several shooting modes aid the photographer with Pano (Panorama), HDR, Burst Shot and Time Lapse. When shooting video, users can turn on EIS (Electronic Image Stabilisation) to ensure judder free results.. New: Alcatel U5 review. The Alcatel A3 has a 5MP selfie camera with its own selfie flash. Alcatel has gone to town here by adding a range of functions related to selfies. There are Face Mask Live Filters and a Face Beauty mode for applying skin filters.. The Face Show feature creates animations to bring selfies to life and there is an Instant Collage feature and a dedicated Selfie Album.. The Alcatel A3 has a 2,460mAh battery and this is more than adequate for providing long usage times.. Next: Samsung Galaxy Note 8 review. 500 MB data. 500 MB data. 1 GB data.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 16 GB + MicroSD. Release date: Jul 1, 2017. Too little RAM memory (1.5 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (294 ppi). The Alcate A3 comes with a 5-inch 720p display, 1.25 GHz quad-core processor, 1.5 GB of RAM, 16 GB of storage (expandable via microSD card), 13-megapixel main camera and an additional 5-megapixel selfie unit on the front.. Dimensions: 5.59 x 2.78 x 0.34 inches (142 x 70.5 x 8.6 mm). Materials: Main body: Plastic; Accents: Metal. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Digital image stabilization, Smile detection, Face detection, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (30 fps), 1280x720 (720p HD) (30 fps). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Quad-core, 1250 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 7, 8, 20. Data: LTE Cat 4 (150/50 Mbit/s), HSDPA+ (4G) 42.2 Mbit/s, HSUPA 11 Mbit/s. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: NFC, UMA (Wi-Fi Calling), Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location.

Alcatel has made a habit of producing smartphones that punch well above their weight and that is continued with the new A3 XL that offers a massive 6-inch screen and loads of features.. If you love a big screen but don’t want to pay a big price this is the smartphone for you.. Priced at just $179, the Alcatel A3 XL is nicely designed with a thin build and a textured rear panel.. And, even at this low price, there is also a fingerprint reader which unlocks the phone in a second.. In terms of size, it’s not much bigger than the iPhone 7 Plus but it has a screen that is half an inch larger.. That 6-inch multi-touch display has a high definition resolution of 1280 x720 at 245ppi (pixels per inch).. Apps, pictures and videos looked great on the big screen which is an ideal size for those who want to consume content, interact with social media and browse websites on the move.. In fact, a more accurate description of the device would be as a âphabletâ – a phone that is not much smaller than a tablet.. The device is powered by a quad-core 1.1 GHz processor so itâs fairly responsive when opening apps and moving between screens.. The Alcatel A3 XL is running the Android 7.0 operating system with no added layers of user interface to battle through.. It’s a much purer Android experience than a lot of other phones can offer.. And being Android means you can use all your favourite apps in the same way as phones that cost several hundreds of dollars more.. Another impressive feature is the front and rear cameras.. The main camera on the back of a phone has an 8-megapixel resolution that captures decent images of a quality that will surprise you.. And if you’re into your selfies, then the Alcatel A3 XL will really impress.. The front camera has a 5-megapixel resolution and it also has a built-in flash so your images will great whether theyâre taken on the beach or in a nightclub.. On the storage side, you will get 16 GB internal memory and that’s OK because there’s also a microSD card slot to expand that capacity.. The advantage of having a big device means you also have a big battery and that’s exactly what you get with the A3 XL â a 3000mAh battery that lasted for a day and half.. The Alcatel A3 XL is available now from Vodafone stores and comes with a free $30 Vodafone credit.. For $179, the Alcatel smartphone is excellent value. No, youâre not going to get all the bells and whistles of $1,000 phone but this device can surely hold its own.. It’s ideal for younger users and maybe a customer looking to invest in their first smartphone. And if you’re looking for a bargain, it’s perfect for you too..

Its a prepaid phone .all prepaid phones are locked to their carrier. however I don’t want to use it as a phone. I want to use solely as a media tablet.. You could buy a lenovo tablet for under 200.. Where can I buy a Alcatel A3 XL phone without locking in to a Vodaphone contract. I wish to buy it outright. You mean unlocked, as in not network locked. You do own the phone outright as a prepaid, and vodafone usually allows you to unlock it after a few months, or $$ spent, (can’t recall which). You might be able to get an unlock code online. Generally if your carrier is using vodafone, (Kogan for example), you can just put in your sim and use the phone normally. This isn’t guaranteed though, (I’ve done this with optus and vodafone resellers in the past). Just ask, how much RAM?

There is an 8-megapixel camera on the back and a 5-megapixel selfie shooter.

Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD.

Alcatel A3 10 review: A big screen tablet with substandard display quality. Alcatel A3 10 is a tablet with a large screen size of 10-inch and WXGA display with a screen resolution of 1280x800 pixels. It has a 1.1GHz quad-core processor with 2GB RAM.. Updated: Friday, September 1, 2017, 14:19 [IST]. Alcatel is a brand well known for smartphones in the price segment of less than Rs. Alcatel is a wholly owned subsidiary of TCL Corporations. Smartphones with Alcatel brand name are being manufactured and shipped since 2014. However, Alcatel has been into mobility business since 1998.. The company's latest product- Alcatel A3 10 is a 10-inch tablet that has been priced at Rs. It dares to intrude a price segment that has been left aloof for quite some time now. Let's go ahead with the review and find out how well does the tablet fares against its inferior competitors.. Specifications: Not extraordinary but performs well!. Alcatel A3 10 boasts specifications that are subtle enough, although there are tablets in the sub10K price segment that have similar features to lure in consumers at the price point the Alcatel A3 10 retails.. The tablet sports 2GB of RAM and 16 GB of inbuilt storage. It offers the option to expand the storage to 128 GB via microSD card support. The device is powered by Quad Core processor, clocked at 1.1 GHz. It has a 5-megapixel primary camera and a 2-megapixel secondary camera. It does not offer flash for either of the cameras.. The tablet offers a big 10-inch WXGA display with a screen resolution of 1280x800 pixels. It has a pixel density of 149 PPI. The device has a 4,600 mAh battery unit. It has micro USB 2.0 port for charging and a 3.5mm audio jack. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!. Design: Bulky for a tablet! Camera: Not much of a snapper Software and UI: Android Nougat with stock UI Display: Questionable screen resolution! Battery backup and speakers: Lasting battery backup! Performance: Performs well for a 1.1 GHZ quad-core processor! Conclusion: A decent performing tab with unsatisfactory display!. The Alcatel A3 10 has a bulky design. It has an elongated screen with an average width. It does not feel light in hands, and is certainly prone to slipping out of hands; however, the rugged texture of the rear panel keeps it slipping out of palms every now and then. The entire body of the tablet constitutes of plastic material.. It comes in a single color which is Black. It has audio jack at the top edge along with micro USB 2.0 charging port, placed close to it. It sports lock/unlock toggle on the right side with volume rockers right below it. The SIM and microSD card slot are on the left side on the rear panel. The slots are covered by a small flap that remains attached to the body of the tablet through a flexible yet strong plastic cord.. The back panel sports the rear camera. The rear panel of the device has a rugged texture. The front panel is all black and glossy and the bezels around the display are substantially small as compared to other tablets. The front camera rests on top of front panel close to the right corner. The most intriguing feature of the design is the dual speaker set placed on top and bottom of the front panel. The speakers rest behind the long yet slim grills that impart an appealing look to the overall design.. The 5-megapixel rear camera is slow and quality is average. Pictures clicked by it lack details.. It would be too much to expect decent low-light pictures from the 5-megapixel rear camera. Yet it captures pictures that are well exposed even indoors.. The front camera of the device is useable. A 2-megapixel camera is certainly outdated yet the quality of the pictures clicked by the device is more than decent. In its defense, tablets are never considered a replacement for a primary camera device, moreover, the bulky size and lack of stabilization tends to produce inferior quality pictures.. It records rather decent videos and what is the best part about its camera is the fact that it supports 720p videos and although the quality isn't great you still do not see any prominent lag.. Alcatel A3 10 runs Android Nougat 7.0 and uses stock Android UI. The UI has no special feature incorporated; however, it has some useful apps such as WPS Office pre-installed on the device. The UI is pretty light and operates smoothly.. The device has a 10-inch XWGA display and the quality is not too challenging for its competition if there is any. Video playback on the big display is well saturated and the contrast levels are ample enough. Users might enjoy watching videos on the device, however, the display is pixelated and Alcatel could have incorporated a display with more pixel density. The display lacks sharpness and users will take some time to get used to the pixelated display.. The daylight performance of the display is satisfactory.. The device houses a 4,600mAh battery which pulls the tablet through 12 hours of extensive usage. With minimal usage and the tablet as a stand by the device, you can get up to 36 hours of backup.. The front firing dual speakers make for a great acoustic experience and I was expecting a smooth playback. The volume on the speakers is loud and clear but with the volume notched up to its maximum limit, a slow hmm and a substantial vibration are noticed which generates from speakers itself.. It works well with the volume turned down to a notch less than the maximum limit.. Alcatel A3 10 has 2GB RAM with 1.1GHz quad core processor. One would never expect the device to run high-end games and a mediocre performance from mid-sized games. It was rather surprising to notice that A3 10 managed to pull Asphalt 8 through and through although there was a noticeable lag. It ran mid-sized games pretty smoothly.. There was a bit of a delay while opening heavy apps but once the app was operative the lag diminished.. Alcatel has placed its tablet in a sparsely ventured price segment with few features that call out to consumers. You can get your hands on the tablet if you want a large display, however, the display quality suffers.. It has decent performing speakers and offers Android Nougat 7.0. There are several reasons for you to avoid buying the tablet if the quality is something you do not want to compromise with. Try getting your hands on a refurbished iPad Mini 2 if possible. Since tablets are never the primary mobile device you can always wait for a few months and choose from the best available tablets.. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!.

The Alcatel A3 XL is a big phone on a budget. Alcatel's A3 XL is not your average budget phone. Huge 6-inch display with 1,080x720-pixel resolution (that's low for a screen this big) 8-megapixel rear camera, 5-megapixel front-facing camera Android 7.0 Nougat (up to date; good!) 8GB internal storage with 1GB ROM (very low) and up to 32GB external storage 3,000mAh battery (good) 1.1GHz quad-core MediaTek processor (slower speeds) Fingerprint reader. Alcatel's A3 XL is not your average budget phone. Phonemakers, put up your fists! Because there's a serious rumble starting over which phone gets to be the best entry-level contender in 2017. After an early start to unseat the reigning champion, Lenovo's Moto G4 , both Huawei and now Alcatel have introduced budget models.. The Alcatel A3 XL here comes in at $200, which converts to about £164 and AU$277. The Alcatel A3 XL is a big phone on a budget. Comparatively, the new Honor 6X costs about the same ($200/£225/not selling in Australia), but it gives you two rear cameras, a larger battery, much more storage and a more promising processor. The Honor phone lacks the A3 XL's current Android version and has a smaller screen -- but hey, it's still 5.5 inches.. We have yet to see Samsung's Galaxy A7 in the flesh, or to hear about its refreshed J series for 2017. Plus, Lenovo has yet to respond with its Moto G5, or whatever the G4 successor turns out to be. While it's no doubt that these phones all skimp somewhere to save you money, it's clear that the budget-minded are in for another year of plenty.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges..

Alcatel A3 10 Tab: The bare minimum tablet Komal Mohan | Gadgets Now | Aug 30, 2017, 03.57PM IST. As a category, tablets are stuck in a conundrum. The sales of tablets have been declining for the last three years, according to an IDC report released earlier this year. The screens of smartphones are getting bigger and six-inch devices are getting popular leading to decline in tablet sales. At the other end, the tablets haven’t really converted laptop users into tablet users. The “phablet” negates the need of carrying two separate devices. However, this hasn’t stopped brands from pushing out new products in the category. Alcatel recently launched a budget tabled – Alcatel A3 10 Tab – for Rs 9,999. We spent some time with the device to see what it has to offer. Here’s our review of the Alcatel A3 10 Tab:. If looks could kill, you’re safe around the Alcatel A3 10 Tab as there’s nothing striking about its appearance. The tablet offers a unibody plastic design with a textured plastic back with Alcatel branding in the centre and the 5MP rear camera at the top right corner (if you're holding the tablet in the landscape mode). The back of the tablet also houses the SIM card and microSD card tray.. The front is dominated by the 10.1-inch display and also has a 2MP selfie camera on the left side and two speaker grilles on either side. The volume rocker buttons are placed at the top. The headset jack and the micro-USB charging port are placed on the left.. The Alcatel A3 10 Tab offers a 10.1-inch multi-touch IPS display with a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels and a pixel density of 149ppi. The display offers good viewing angles, however, the colour temperature is on the warmer side. There’s nothing much to crow about the display as text and images are decent and certainly not as sharp what full HD display could offer.The screen is reflective and slightly prone to smudging but somehow the tablet delivers respectable legibility at full brightness under sunlight.. The Alcatel A3 10 Tab is powered by 1.1GHz quad-core MediaTek MT8735B processor coupled with 2GB RAM. It offers 16GB of internal storage, almost 12GB is available to users. For additional storage, users can install microSD cards of up to 128GB capacity.. The Alcatel A3 10 Tab runs Android 7.0 Nougat. The interface is clean and user-friendly. There is an app drawer which gives the home screen a neat and clean look. There are a few third party apps lie Flipkart, File Transfer and WPS office which come pre-loaded and can be uninstalled.. We ran Antutu and GeekBench 4 tests on the device. While the tablet scored 24422 in Antutu Benchmarks, the single-core and multi-core scores on GeekBench 4 were 466 and 1249 respectively.. While navigating through the tablet’s menu and launching apps, we noticed a visible lag. Just like the display, the audio quality from the speakers is distinctly average. While playing games and watching videos, the tablet offers marginally better performance. If you intend to make calls through the tablet, you will be satisfied with the network reception. Alcatel A3 10 Tab offers usual connectivity options like LTE, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and GPS.. The tablet is backed by a 4,600mAh battery and will last you more than a complete day.. The Alcatel A3 10 Tab offers a 5MP rear camera and a 2MP front facing camera. The images live up to the low quality camera on offer and while there are options like Panorama and Manual modes, the images leave a lot to be desired. There’s inadequate colour reproduction and are markedly of poor quality.. At Rs 9,999, the Alcatel A3 10 Tab is an entry-level tablet and doesn’t deliver much. Unless you’re really keen on buying a tablet, do not want to spend a lot and don’t care too much about specifications, it could be the device for you.. performance Quad core display 10.1" (25.65 cm) camera 5 MP battery 4600 mAh See Full Specifications.

Alcatel A3 review: cheap but decent The first thing that strikes you about the Alcatel A3 phone is the price. Not a whopping $1000 or so, but an affordable $149.. By Cynthia Karena 15 November 2017 — 1:47pm. Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size. The first thing that strikes you about the Alcatel A3 phone is the price. Not a whopping $1000 or so, but an affordable $149.. The Alcatel A3 runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow and has 16GB internal storage, which isn't much, but this is a budget phone.. Nothing fancy, but Alacatel's A3 does the job.. It's not a sexy phone or a gorgeous looking phone, but it feels solid and looks sleek in a classic grey-and-black combo with curved edges. Not bad at this price point.. For added value, there's also a fingerprint reader. But, annoyingly, it's on the back of the device. This makes it awkward to set up because you need to read the front of the screen while pressing the back of the phone at the same time. It's also directly under the camera lens, which has been smudged by my fingers a few times while I'm feeling around for the sensor.. Impressively, the fingerprint scanner can store up to five prints that can each launch a different action, including opening the camera, turning the torch on and off, and starting a sound recording.. The main rear camera is only eight megapixels (front selfie camera is five), but the photos are crisp and clear in good light. My backyard looked great with realistic colours, and close-ups of flowers worked well. The camera could also handle the harsh bright midday light.. But don't expect the same quality photos in low light or for moving subjects. Your indoor food and party shots will need some post editing. Skin tones look sickly; this is not the phone for selfie greatness. However, there is a fun Face Mask option that overlays selfies with antlers, a pirate face, or a facemask that blows kisses when you pout..
