This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. High Tech Computer Corporation (HTC) is a Taiwanese manufacturer of mobile phones and other electronic products. In 2012, HTC stopped producing tablets under their own name. In 2012-2013, they faced heavy sales declines. Since then, the company is medium-sized in the smartphone sector. There are numerous reviews on HTC Smartphones (as of 2016)..
