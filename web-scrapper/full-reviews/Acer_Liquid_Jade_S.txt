If you can see past its flaws, the Liquid Jade S offers some of the best performance and build quality of any affordable dual-SIM smartphone.. While the name 'Acer' is one more synonymous with desktop and laptop computers, over the past couple of years the Taiwanese company has released some solid budget and mid-range smartphones, such as the Liquid Z4 and E3 .. Acer, like a number of other Asian smartphone manufacturers, is continuing to push the boundaries in regards to value for money, recently showcasing four upcoming budget-oriented devices at MWC 2015, including the promising Liquid M220 and Jade Z .. Last year, it was in the mid-range category where Acer showed signs of progress, giving us the curvaceous Liquid Jade. While at the time it was the firm's best shot at a smartphone, a number of gripes, including underwhelming performance, prevented Acer's flagship from really competing outside of Asia.. This year's iteration, the Liquid Jade S, looks to boost performance without altering the overall design of its predecessor. The Liquid Jade S retains the 5-inch 720p display from the Jade, covered by a single piece of curved Corning Gorilla Glass 3, with the same 13MP rear snapper with LED flash combo around the back.. Inside, Acer has added a more powerful Mediatek MT6752M processor with 2GB RAM and 4G LTE, and upgraded the internal storage to 16GB with the option to expand by a further 32GB via a MicroSD card.. Although a high maximum brightness level is great for outdoor legibility, the screen is far too radiant in dark conditions, even at the lowest brightness level. Unlike many of their Chinese counterparts, the majority of Taiwanese Android smartphones come with Google apps and services such as the Play Store pre-installed. The Acer Liquid Jade S is no exception and a SIM-free model can be snapped up for £229.99 (around $336, AU$438).. While on paper the specs have seen a welcome upgrade from the original Liquid Jade, it remains to be seen how the Liquid Jade S fairs against current mid-rangers such as the Honor 6 and the Oneplus One .. Acer has really thrown the cat amongst the pigeons here. It's rare to see a smartphone in this price category with such a slick and minimal design. At just 120g, the Liquid Jade S is incredibly light. While the aesthetics won't appeal to everyone, the flowing curves are more than merely aesthetic and contribute to a superb in-hand feel.. An Acer logo, an earpiece somewhat reminiscent of a watering can rose and a 5MP front snapper are the only noticeable elements on the face of the Liquid Jade S. Proximity and ambient light sensors, as well as an LED notification light, are hidden away under a single piece of Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which tapers gently into the faux-chrome surround.. The microphone can easily be covered up by your palm when taking a call. Despite the 5-inch IPS display having a resolution of only 1280 x 720, resulting in a pixel density of 294 PPI, text and images look crisp.. Viewing angles are also impressive with little-to-no colour shifting and thin bezels helping to create a pleasant, immersive viewing experience.. There's very little to see on the bottom edge of the Liquid Jade S, with Acer keeping things minimal once again. The microUSB port takes up a wide position flanked by a single microphone, which sits precariously close to one of the many rounded corners.. The dual-SIM card and microSD card slot is located on the left-hand side of the Liquid Jade S, with the volume rocker on the right. In terms of positioning, the volume keys are perfect.. Thanks to the slim faux-chrome edge, which flows effortlessly into the rear, the Liquid Jade S feels considerably slimmer than it's 7.8mm profile may suggest. However, they feel rather cheap when pressed, giving off a far from confidence-inducing click. The volume '-' key also has a habit of sticking, which doesn't bode well for longevity.. Although the Liquid Jade S is not particularly tall for a device with a 5-inch display, it is still a little awkward to reach the power button on the top edge.. Thus, as when using the HTC One M8 , some hand-gymnastics will be needed for those with small-to-medium sized hands.. Fortunately, the power button is considerably better feeling than the volume rocker, and while not stellar, it does provide a certain amount of tactile feedback.. The 3.5mm headphone jack and noise cancelling microphone are also located on the top edge. Around the back, the Liquid Jade S retains the protruding 13MP camera and single LED flash combo from the Liquid Jade. Acer has decided to do away with the silver ring around the outside of the camera lens, resulting in a more polished and understated look.. The Acer branding, DTS-HD logo and spherical speaker also return from the Liquid Jade, but the Taiwanese firm has decided to tone down the overall appearance of the rear.. Instead of using the same glossy plastic as the Liquid Jade, the Liquid Jade S features a matte brushed metal-effect finish. As well as being less of a fingerprint magnet, the matte rear makes for a much improved in-hand feel.. Solid construction combined with subtlely stylish curves. As you'd expect, even with curved Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and durable matte plastic around the back, the Liquid Jade S still feels a lot less premium than metal/glass flagships such as the HTC One M9 , Samsung Galaxy S6 and the iPhone 6. Nevertheless, for an affordable mid-range device, the design and build of the Liquid Jade S is impressive.. If the black Liquid Jade S is a little too understated for your liking, white, pink and red variants are also available.. Next Page Key features and interface.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Luis D.. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 2 Interface, Functionality and Connectivity. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction The Acer Liquid Jade S is Acer's new mid-range smartphone. It's positioned as a promising product of the “value proposition” type, which offers pleasant design, snappy hardware, a sizeable 5-inch display, a 13MP camera, dual-SIM & LTE connectivity, and many practical software features – all that at about half the price of current high-end Android smartphones! You won't be wrong to ask “excellent, but what are the caveats?” - so go on with our review. The package includes: USB Cable Charger Earbuds Smartphone Warranty Safety instructions Design Sleek and pleasant in a calming, mildly understated manner. This is how we'd describe the Liquid Jade S' design, and those are words you'll rarely hear for a budget device ! It's not the build materials that make this smartphone special, though. It's the curves! The Jade S has an intensely rounded body comprising two layers. It starts with a non-removable plastic back panel of decent quality - sturdy, carefully sculpted, with a smooth, matte finish. The pleasant surprises don't end here - Acer topped off the smartphone with curved glass, which completes its liquid, flowing appearance. The layers are held together by a thin chrome frame. Speaking of thin, the Acer Liquid Jade S is 0.3-inches (7.78mm) thick and it's light as a feather at 4.09oz (116g). The thickness may not sound very impressive on paper, but the phone flaunts a hidden trump card - its beveled edges make it feel thinner than it actually is! And with compact dimensions of 5.53 x 2.72 x 0.30 in (140.5 x 69mm) to complement its build quality, the Liquid Jade S feels pretty well in the hand. On the top edge of the phone, you'll find a 3.5mm audio jack, while the volume buttons are positioned to the right. They are not of good quality - it's a small plastic stripe that never feels quite right under your fingers. It lacks the clickiness to make it feel responsive enough, and the “Vol -” key tends to get stuck at times, which is a major flaw. The “+” key has been made slightly convex as to let your finger recognize it more easily. Acer also had the good intention of making the central area of the volume keys double as a two-step camera shutter. Unfortunately, the stripe's mid-zone, where your index finger is supposed to land while taking a photo, is small and non-reliable. It's too easy to press the “Vol +” or “Vol -” buttons by mistake, rather than the “shutter” key, potentially ending up with a failed photo. On the bottom, there's the inevitable microUSB port. The left side houses a dual-SIM slot, which carries either up to two nanoSIM cards, or one microSD card and a single nanoSIM card. It's one or the other - you can't have two SIM cards and an external microSD card in place simultaneously. Above the display, you'll find Acer's typical earpiece, which oddly looks like a miniature shower drain; along with a pair of light & proximity sensors, and the front camera. On the back panel, there are the aforementioned camera with a single LED flash, and a mono loudspeaker. Display Decent viewing angles and brightness, but poor image quality. The Acer Liquid Jade S sports a 5-inch IPS LCD display with a 720x1280 resolution and a pixel density of 294 pixels per inch. One would certainly expect better image quality of a screen with such parameters. Unfortunately, the picture looks somewhat jagged, as if there's always something wrong with it. That, the poor minimal brightness level, and the slightly colder colors are the meaningful problems to report here. Otherwise, the maximum brightness and viewing angles are great, which ensures comfortable visibility under most conditions. However, that curved glass layer is quite reflective, so don't expect miracles under direct sunlight.. 5.63 x 2.72 x 0.31 inches. 143 x 69 x 7.8 mm. 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 inches. 138.5 x 70.9 x 8.9 mm. 5.41 x 2.69 x 0.37 inches. 137.4 x 68.2 x 9.3 mm. 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 inches. 136.6 x 69.8 x 7.9 mm.

Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright).

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Luis D.. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 2 Interface, Functionality and Connectivity. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Call Quality The Liquid Jade S will make you strain to hear anything. With an earpiece as quiet as thus one, you won't be enjoying great calls, and you will miss ringtones in noisier environments for sure. Voices are clear enough, but the output is simply too low! You will really have to stick the handset close to your ear to be able to make up anything. If you own a headset , you'll be good to go, but normal everyday talks will be a problem, unless Acer does something for that muted pair of speakers! Battery life The smartphone lasts a work day, but it could last longer. It could also be a bit faster to charge. The Acer Liquid Jade S lasted 8 hours, 32 minutes and 46 seconds in our battery test. This is a decent result, although one would expect it to last even longer due to the frugal 720p display and the sufficient 2300mAh battery. But it seems that fast MediaTek octa-core chipset likes to sip on battery juice. Either way, the smartphone is rated at 6 hours of talk time and 250 hours of standby time. The battery is not user replaceable, and charging it to 100% takes a long 2 hours and 42 minutes with the included charger. Conclusion The Acer Liquid Jade S is a smartphone with evident strengths and weaknesses. For starters, its design qualities are above average. Its graceful body feels thin, light, sturdy, and very comfortable, although the back panel is on the slippery side. Meanwhile, the curved glass layer is straight-up premium tier! Moreover, the Liquid Jade S is reasonably fast and feature-packed. It runs on recent hardware and software. It also has good battery life. Unfortunately, its photo and video capabilities are underwhelming, despite its 13MP camera sensor and well-rounded camera app. Finally, due to its low earpiece and loudspeaker output, the Jade S fails at the basic task of being a reliable phone ! The Acer Liquid Jade S will be sold in the Europe, Middle East, and African region at $330 (299 EUR) unlocked. We don't know whether Acer plans on launching it in America. In this price range, Europeans have a wide choice of competing devices that outclass the Liquid Jade S in most categories. One could simply pick an older flagship like the LG G2 , Sony Xperia Z1 , HTC One (M7) , Z1 Compact , or the Samsung Galaxy S4 at about the same price, and set themselves with a noticeably superior experience.. In these circumstances, the Acer Liquid Jade S seems poorly situated on the market, and practically begs for a price cut to stand a chance.. Bonus software features to tinker with. Price is a bit high for what you get. Acer Liquid Jade S Compare. (Posts: 6794; Member since: 29 Mar 2012). posted on 26 Feb 2015, 03:55. The phone photo quality looks ok to me.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. isn't normally a name that you associated with smartphones, but I've been spending time with its Liquid Jade S smartphone and found it to be a competent handset. Given it's half the price of higher-end units such as. the Samsung Galaxy S6 , the Jade S represents value for money with a specification that delivers enough power, styling that looks smart without being flashy, and a few welcome tweaks in the hardware.. One thing you'll notice about the Jade S when you pick it up is how light and thin the handset is. current style of smartphones, Acer has put together a handset that weighs just 120g and has a thickness of 7.3 mm. It doesn't attempt to stand out with anything special. It does feel like Acer has. Google's recommended specifications for Android hardware with the least amount of effort, and because of that has ended up. with a minimalist design that reflects Acer's brand quality.. The handset is comfortable to hold in the hand, and is well-balanced so typing one-handed doesn't lead to the Jade S tipping out and falling to the floor. Choosing to go with a five-inch 720p resolution screen means that. most of the handset's UI is reachable with a single hand (needing. just a touch of a stretch to reach the far corner of the screen). was the location of the power button. It's on the top edge of the unit, as opposed to the side, and that makes it awkward to reach. The back of the handset features. a curious looking speaker grill - it's. a ring of speaker holes with a central dimple, and above. it is the label DTS HD. is a configurable sound equalizer in software that allows you to beef up the sound of. coming out of the Jade S, and is a nice feature to mention in marketing.. the sound file being played has more impact than this feature, and after some experimenting I left it turned with a bit of boost on the bass levels to provide the. best experience possible through my favorite in-ear headphones. It doesn't lift the Jade S up over the mid-range. competition, and the software doesn't compensate for the quiet external speaker on the handset.. This lack of oomph in the sound department also extends to the. Jade S's performance during a phone call. In a noisy environment it was sometimes a struggle to. hold a conversation without resorting to 'can you speak up a bit' and 'I missed that, can you say that again?'. With the majority of the casing in plastic, the Jade S. is clearly in the mid-range bracket, and the plastic buttons for power and volume do feel a bit weak and ineffectual, but they do get the job done.. Acer Liquid Jade S (image: Ewan Spence). Rounding out the case is a single piece of Corning's Gorilla Glass 3 which protects the screen elements on the handset. It's nice to see that Acer has not skimped on the screen in the bid to keep the costs under control. The resolution of is more than acceptable at the mid-range price point, and the smaller five-inch screen helps keep the pixel density high. Acer's thin font and UI elements offer a crisp look to the graphics and text on the screen, and the wide. viewing angle on the screen rivals many higher-priced smartphones.. I did find that the screen was perhaps not as bright as it could be. This causes issues in strong sunlight and in bright conditions, as the display has a tendency to wash-out in these surroundings..

ACER Liquid Jade S - S56 - Android 4.4.4 - Sporadic reboots & system update fails. I bought a brand new Acer Liquid Jade S and had some initial problems:. 1) The SIM card seems to easily slip out of the slide.. 2) The seller advertised the OS as Android 5.. Problem 1 was corrected by using a different phone cover (the first one seemed to "click" the sim card slide out of place.. Problem 2 appears to be something that will be resolved somewhere this year (when ?).. Problem 4 remains, and the current update appears to have a fix for problem 3.. "A new system update is available (34.25 MB)". I select "Download now", the download succeeds and the prompt is. "Restart & install", which I select.. The phone then restarts and shows the following messages:. When selecting "reboot system now", the phone reboots and messages "Update failed".. Please correct the problem or tell me what to do. The sporadic freezes and reboots are quite annoying, especially since they occur so often.. There are more expensive models out there, but this isn't the cheapest one.. P.S.: I do like the phone regardless. It has a very nice feel, beautiful design and it fits my needs exactly (low SAR output and dual-SIM for instance).. Posts: 17,647 ACE Trailblazer.

In terms of performance and design, Acer has improved upon its flagship from last year with the Liquid Jade S. Yet it is still far from the finished article and exhibits a number of issues that, unless you are looking for a dual-SIM device, are hard to overlook.. Thanks to the octa-core processor and Acer's minimal software tweaks, the performance of the Liquid Jade S is simply stellar. For just over £200, it's arguably one of, if not, the most powerful mid-range smartphones currently available – and even gives flagships a run for their money.. Design is another major high point with the lightweight, curvaceous build resulting in a solid and comfortable in-hand feel. The dual-SIM card slot is well integrated into the phone's aesthetic and, while the feature is not essential for everyone, it's incredibly handy for many businesspeople and frequent travellers.. Expandable storage in the form of a microSD is a welcome addition, although you do have to sacrifice one of the nanoSIM card slots for the privilege.. On the software side of things, Acer's Liquid UI is functional and includes the useful 'Float Apps' multitasking feature, allowing you to use multiple mini apps at once on one screen.. The rather quiet pair of speakers on the Liquid Jade S really hampers the overall core experience. If you're in a loud spot you'll be hard to pushed to hear anything through the earpiece, and due to the muted output of the rear-firing unit, it's easy to miss a call or notification.. Even DTS enhanced audio cannot save the rear speaker from sounding faint and a little tinny. If you want acceptable audio, you have to slip on a pair of headphones.. Battery life is average at best and only light-to-moderate users will make it through the day without needing to charge. Power-saving mode is present, but heavy users will definitely rue Acer's decision not to go for a removable battery.. Linked into the issue of battery life, Android Kitkat is currently on-board the Liquid Jade S and despite being stable, it doesn't include optimisations for the 64-bit processor. An update to Lollipop will rectify this, but at present it still hasn't been released for the Liquid Jade S.. Considering the promising optical specs and impressive camera app, results are disappointing. Both the primary 13MP unit and the 5MP snapper up-front produce noise-filled images and videos that lack clarity as well as detail.. Acer is heading in the right direction with the Liquid Jade S, showcasing its ability to combine an impressive design and blistering performance with an affordable price tag.. That being said, there are still a few key areas where it suffers in comparison to other mid-range offerings, and as a result, the Liquid Jade S may not be at the top of everyone's wish list.. However, if you are in the market for an affordable dual-SIM smartphone that is powerful and well made, you'll be hard pushed to find one better than the Acer Liquid Jade S..

Finding a spot in the crowded midrange is no walk in the park, and the Acer Liquid Jade S couldn't quiet convince us that it has what it takes. It started off great, impressing us with its design, UI and performance, but the phone gets three strikes in very important areas - display, battery, and camera. Unless there's a price cut in its near future, we don't think it can get away with that.. A nice handset that has been well made and put together. This is a hard one really as I want to like this phone but there are a few things here that just put me off. I cannot quite place my finger on it. I do like the build quality although it is plastic it feels nice and solid and the plastic has no rough edges etc. The screen is very bright even at its lowest settings meaning that in direct sunlight I have still been able to see things. Delving deeper into the design is where things start to unravel with the wierd placement od the sleep lock button and the 2nd mic position start to see bigger issues. I am not sure I’d the phone has been designed for a left handed user but the phone just feels awkward in the right hand you invariably end up activating the volume button with the palm of your hand.... This is a hard one really as I want to like this phone but there are a few things here that just put me off. I cannot quite place my finger on it.

Delving deeper into the design is where things start to unravel with the wierd placement od the sleep lock button and the 2nd mic position start to see bigger issues. I am not sure I’d the phone has been designed for a left handed user but the phone just feels awkward in the right hand you invariably end up activating the volume button with the palm of your hand. I liked the camera apart from the finikity UI and its a big improvment over the pure Android UI. I do wish that I could remove some of the modes on the camera. Thereby getting rid of the cluttered look, however as you can see the camera is not too shabby. If you are want a high end mid tier phone this defiantly one to consider, however if you want high end then you need to look elsewhere..

Its graceful body feels thin, light, sturdy, and very comfortable, although the back panel is on the slippery side. Meanwhile, the curved glass layer is straight-up premium tier.... The Acer Liquid Jade S is a smartphone with evident strengths and weaknesses. For starters, its design qualities are above average. Its graceful body feels thin, light, sturdy, and very comfortable, although the back panel is on the slippery side. Meanwhile, the curved glass layer is straight-up premium tier! Moreover, the Liquid Jade S is reasonably fast and feature-packed. It runs on recent hardware and software. It also has good battery life. Unfortunately, its photo and video capabilities are underwhelming, despite its 13MP camera sensor and well-rounded camera app. Finally, due to its low earpiece and loudspeaker output, the Jade S fails at the basic task of being a reliable phone! The Acer Liquid Jade S will be sold in the Europe, Middle East, and African region at $330 (299 EUR) unlocked. We don't know whether Acer plans on launching it in America. In this price range, Europeans have a wide choice of competing devices that outclass the Liquid Jade S in most categories. One could simply pick an older flagship like the LG G2, Sony Xperia Z1, HTC One (M7), Z1 Compact, or the Samsung Galaxy S4 at about the same price, and set themselves with a noticeably superior experience.. In these circumstances, the Acer Liquid Jade S seems poorly situated on the market, and practically begs for a price cut to stand a chance.. Darn, there are no reviews yet for.

Acer Liquid Jade S specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (22). Acer Liquid Jade S key features. Dual SIM slots, quad-band 2G connectivity for both SIM cards, quad-band 3G and Cat. 4 LTE for download speeds up to 150Mbps. Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, hotspot; GPS with A-GPS. 64-bit Mediatek MT6752M chipset with an octa-core Cortex-A53 processor clocked at 1.5GHz. 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage on board, expandable up to 32GB via microSD card in place of SIM 2. 5-inch IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen display of 1,280 x 720 pixels resolution, Gorilla Glass 3 protection. 13MP main camera with fast f1.8 lens, autofocus, and LED flash; 1080p@30fps video recording. Android 4.4.4 KitKat with thorough customizations from Acer, promised upgrade to Lollipop. Power button is in an uncomfortable position. You can't have dual-SIM and microSD at the same time. It's a tall order for any midranger to stand out among a myriad of offerings in the market. Both established brands and emerging Asian manufacturers are trying hard to grab a piece of that market spoiling those shopping there for choice. The Acer Liquid Jade S aims to make a name for itself with bold looks, slim waistline and balanced hardware.. Announced merely six months after the Liquid Jade the S version brings notable upgrades in several major areas. A more powerful chipset, featuring an octa-core processor and a higher-grade graphics processor is the key change, but the doubled operating memory and onboard storage are also important updates. The new SoC is not just about higher performance though, it also brings LTE support to the mix.. Meanwhile, other key features have been retained starting with the 5-inch display. True, it's not FullHD, but qHD resolutions aren't unheard of in the price segment and 720p gives enough density without rising the price too high. The dual SIM capability will be appreciated by a certain type of users, even if the second card needs to fight with the microSD for the shared slot space.. The Acer Liquid Jade S sports prominent styling too. While certain design elements may not be to everyone's liking, it's definitely not just another nameless black rectangle of a smartphone. It's also light and pleasantly thin - a rarity in a price range where build is usually sacrificed at the altar of lower price.. So, as evidenced by the above list, the Acer Liquid Jade S addresses the predecessor's shortcomings and adds up to a convincing smartphone package on paper. The capable hardware is complemented by unusual styling that may not please everyone, but is certainly a conversation starter.. Acer Liquid Jade S official images.

The Acer Liquid Jade’s battery is 2,100mAh, which is about right for a 5-inch smartphone. We found the battery life to be impressive for the cell’s size, however. We managed to get one-and-a-half day’s use out of one charge. That’s probably thanks to the low-power processor and the less demanding 720p screen. We weren’t letting the Liquid Jade off easy, either. We tried gaming, video playback, ran benchmarks, took photographs, texted, and called all during a 36-hour period without having the phone die.. If you’re a real power user, however, then you’ll get good use out of the battery saver mode that’s tucked away in the settings. It throttles the processor to keep battery life in check, and means the handset doesn’t get so warm. And if that’s not enough, there’s also a dedicated Power Save app bundled with the Liquid Jade.. Bear in mind that utilising the app to its full extent will mean you’ll lose a lot of features; GPS, Bluetooth, and mobile data to name a few. We’d say this is best used in an emergency, rather than extending life for daily use. Fortunately, you can select which individual features you want turned off. This means you can forgo location services, but keep mobile data on so you don’t miss texts.. Unfortunately, Acer decided to put its main speaker on the lower back of the Liquid Jade. We’re not sure why, but it was a bad choice, as surfaces muffle the sound when the phone is lying flat.. Call quality is fine, though, and we found hearing the person on the end of the line to be easy. The volume for phone calls can be turned up quite loud, although audio does become slightly muddier at the higher end. The hands-free loudspeaker is suitably clear, and worked well in both both transmitting and relaying audio.. It should also be noted that the Acer Liquid Jade does get quite warm during calls, which can make holding the phone to your ear for extended periods of time uncomfortable. If you’re planning on chin-wagging for a couple of hours, you might want to switch to hands-free or plug in a pair of headphones to avoid sweaty lugs.. There were several aspects of the Acer Liquid Jade that really made us smile. The first is the camera; it’s very reliable and consistent, and images come out well enough to peddle on your social network of choice. The battery life was also pretty good, and the host of power-saving features gave us even more confidence in its ability to get you through a day. Acer’s small Float apps are a neat addition too, despite being a tad niche.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

It’s impossible to justify spending £229 on a device that doesn’t hold up against the £79-cheaper Moto G (2014) .. We’re not being petty; this phone will annoy you if you’re using it every day. Simple tasks often come with bewildering delays, and that really lets what is an otherwise respectable smartphone down.. If you want a cheap phone that can take decent photos and isn’t hugely expensive – look out for discounts – the Acer Liquid Jade certainly isn’t a bad buy. We’d find it hard to recommend it over its formidable competitors, however.. The Acer Liquid Jade gets a lot of things right, and serves as a reliable budget smartphone. Still, unless you can pick one up in a sale, we’d say you’re. better off plumping for the Moto G (2014).. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

Anyone subscribed to this thread? Here's some "known issues" I found on the S56 so far... hopefully someone can fix them (or Acer does?)?. Cannot select AcerNAV when clicking in Calendar or other navigation apps. I had problems entering DTMF when I was wearing my headset. Someone reported getting GPS fix was difficult sometimes. Wi-fi Tethering does not work for me most of the times. Anyone else other issues? I'll add them to the list above. Join Date: Joined: Dec 2008. I am a not-so-happy owner of a Jade S, and I have big issues with the battery. I removed almost all the preinstalled Acer software and even installed Juice Defender, but phone's radio & wifi drains the battery even more than the screen (with an active usage). How are your impressions about battery life? I have to charge the phone at lunch time, or it never makes it to the end of the day... Join Date: Joined: Jun 2006. I drain my battery within a day but never really bother. I just recharge whenever I can and usually even carry a power pack with me to extra charge whenever I don't have access to USB charging... But I have many (100's!) apps running and especially apps like skype and facebook are huge batt drainers... sorry, can't really help you with it.

I have experience memory problem on s55. I never have this problem before, but when using s55, has problem. luckily I can ask the shop to replace it, but I think, s55 caused the problem. some of file/photo in my s55 cannot be deleted. but new file can still writeable. any one have the same experience? how to solve it?. I am thinking about rooting it now.. and the battery is also enough for 1 day on average use. but lately, I have experience a lot of lag and found this problem. Join Date: Joined: Jun 2006. I haven't yet had this on s56, but we did hear some other stuff like this on s55. Advice would be to format your sdcards (after backup off course). With any Android device (like Windows ) it's advisable to sometimes factory default and start over. Installation of certain apps and such can often cause lag, etc..
