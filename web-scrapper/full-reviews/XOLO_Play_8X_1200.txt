No Expert reviews found for this mobile.. Really nice mobile but has 2 major drawbacks.... I am a xolo play 8x-1200 user. I had compared this mobile with almost 20 models in the same price range, I was very satisfied with the results. It beats almost all mobiles in its range in terms of features and specifications. Finally it has been two days since I bought this mobile. I'm happy with the features and everything (looks, camera etc.). But it has major drawbacks, it heats up quickly. It reach's 42-45°C while running games like transformer,injustice, (the high graphic games). It feels like the mobile is going to burst due to heat. It is hard to touch this mobile when heated up, your hands start getting burning sensation. The other drawback is the battery life, the battery is almost dead by afternoon ,needs to get charged up twice a day. The last drawback is the earphone quality, its not good, the sound frequency output is less (like damp and irritating), your head starts paining after listing through earphones for around 30-40mins. I would suggest buyers to purchase canvas gold instead of this piece. I want to replace this mobile for canvas gold if possible now.....lol. Due to these drawbacks this phone suffers otherwise it would have been the best. 1.Excellent Features 2.Camera Quality is nice 3.Dual LED flash is helpful 4.Never lags(processor and other stuff works well). 1.Heats up badly(reaches 42-45°C within 15mins of normal gaming) 2.Battery life is poor(Needs to get charged twice a day,doesn't lasts much) 3.Earphone quality is bad(causes headache after listining through earphones for 20-30mins).. The Phone is great for Gaming, but battery drains fast. Good For gaming(Ex Asphalt 8) 5. More than 1 GB ram always free. Enter each Pro in new line.. Enter each Con in new line..

CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM..

The sensor characteristics are some of the main factors determining the quality of the camera integrated in the mobile device.. Information about the dimensions of the image sensor used in the device. Usually cameras with larger sensors and less pixel density tend to provide better image quality despite the lower resolution.. A smaller pixel size allows the image sensor to use more pixels thus providing better image resolution. On the other hand, this may negatively impact noise levels and decrease image quality at high ISO settings.. Crop factor is the ratio of the dimensions of a full frame camera's sensor (36 x 24 mm, which equals the frame size of a 35 mm film) and the dimensions of the image sensor of the device. The number shown is the ratio between the diagonals of a full frame sensor (43.3 mm) and the device sensor.. Cameras of mobile devices use mainly a LED or a Xenon flash. The LED flash has a softer burst of light and in contrast to the much brighter Xenon flash, is used for recording videos as well..
