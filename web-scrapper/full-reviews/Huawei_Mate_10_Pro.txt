CNET también está disponible en español.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro review:. Huawei Mate 10 Pro (Mocha Brown). Huawei Mate 10 Pro (Titanium Gray). Huawei Mate 10 Pro (Midnight Blue). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Mate 10 Pro is sleek and solid, very powerful and takes great photos in both colour and black and white. It's also water-resistant and battery life is superb.. The Bad You can't expand the storage and there's no headphone jack. The Bottom Line While it doesn't have all the Galaxy Note 8's features, the Mate 10 Pro earns its place in the high-end big-screen pack.. Great camera, in colour and mono. Huawei has pinned its hopes on the Mate 10 Pro ( $738.11 at Amazon.com ) as its flagship phone for the year. It was designed to be just as good as the Galaxy Note 8 ( $900.00 at Amazon.com ). And with its huge display, powerful processor and cool camera, it gets pretty close.. The Mate 10 Pro isn't quite as fully featured as the Note 8, missing as it does the S Pen stylus, expandable storage and its own virtual assistant (though we're not totally sold on Bixby Voice ). At around £700 or AU$1,099 (that converts to about $920), this phone isn't cheap. But solid all-round performance makes it a good option if you want a gorgeous, big screen, high-end phone without the Samsung name or the Note 8's staggeringly high price (£869 or AU$1,499; the Note 8 costs about $950 in the US).. The Pro here isn't the only phone in the Mate 10 ( $587.60 at Amazon.com ) series. The standard Mate 10 has a smaller 5.9-inch display, a fingerprint scanner on the front (rather than on the back) and it isn't waterproof. Internal specs are much the same and it should be the cheaper model, although pricing and availability aren't cemented just yet.. Only the Pro version sells in the UK, however, while the Mate 10 will be available in Australia. Neither phone has been announced for the US.. Huawei's glass and metal Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro. With its 6-inch screen, there's no escaping the fact that the Mate 10 Pro is a large phone. The tiny bezel on all sides means that the body hasn't had to balloon out any more than is necessary, but even so, I struggled to type with just one hand. The glass back makes it a bit slippery to juggle around when you're trying to tap an icon that's just out of reach. If you've got smaller hands, you'll have some adjusting to do to hit that fingerprint reader on the back.. To help with one-handed use, Huawei has added an on-screen button called the Navigation Dock, which can replace the navigation bar. It floats over whatever you're looking at and can be moved into just the correct position for your thumb to reach. A single tap takes you back a step, press and hold to go home, or press and swipe right to open your multitasking wheel. It does mean you have a small white orb hovering over everything you're looking at, but it's easy to move out of the way or turn off altogether.. Huawei achieves that slim bezel by moving the fingerprint scanner from beneath the display to the back, below the camera. The screen now dominates the front of the phone, giving plenty of room to show off your favourite Netflix shows. The 2,160x1,080-pixel resolution is a step below the Note 8's 2,960x1,440-pixels, but in everyday use you're unlikely to see much difference. It's crisp, with vibrant colours and it's bright enough to sear your eyeballs right out.. Huawei shoehorned a bunch of gestures into the "Smart Assistance" section of the Mate 10 Pro's settings app. For example, you can take a screenshot by knocking the screen with your knuckles, and launch split-screen mode by swiping your finger horizontally across the screen. These are largely frustrating gimmicks rather than time-savers. You can largely ignore them, but they still let us down, and needlessly pounded our knuckles.. Huawei has taken a cue from Apple in switching the rear design from metal to glass. While Apple made the move to support wireless charging, however, Huawei's decision is purely down to aesthetics -- there's no wireless charging on this phone. I do love the design, however, despite the glass being an absolute fingerprint magnet. It looks sleek, modern and classy. It's the sort of phone you won't feel embarrassed about pulling from your smart jacket pocket and you'll enjoy the sideways glances as people look and try to make out what it is.. CNET reviewers got the Mate 10 Pro in both slate and brown shades. Surprisingly, we liked the brown best. It might seem like the least exciting colour for a flashy gadget (shoutout to anyone who remembers the brown Zune ), but it makes a refreshing change from the usual black or silver phones on sale. It's the colour I'd choose if I were buying the phone myself.. On the back is a similar dual camera setup to the ones we've seen on the Huawei P10 ( $649.00 at Amazon.com ). A 12-megapixel sensor takes shots in colour, while a 20-megapixel sensor shoots exclusively in black and white.. Shots from both sensors look great. Colours are rich, with great exposure balance between bright skies and shadowy foregrounds. The white balance does seem to err a little on the cold side, but it's an easy couple of taps to adjust that and warm the scene up a bit. It performs well in low light too, producing bright, clear shots with minimal image noise.. The camera has done a great job balancing the very bright sky and the more shadowy building of London's Alexandra Palace. ( Click here to see full size .). This scene looked a bit cold until I tweaked the white balance to properly capture the warm Autumnal colours. ( Click here to see full size .). Despite the low light, the phone has captured a bright, sharp shot with plenty of detail and accurate colours. ( Click here to see full size .). You can take portrait photos with a tap of an on-screen control. While the Mate 10 Pro doesn't save both versions, like the Galaxy Note 8 does, portraits from the Mate 10 have a decent amount of background blur, which helps your subject pop out from the scene. The "cut-out" around the subject isn't always particularly neat (the iPhone 8 Plus ( $526.40 at Amazon.com ) was more consistent in my experience), but it's good enough to help jazz up your Instagram portraits..

Not only is the Huawei Mate 10 Pro the most impressive device we’ve seen from Huawei to date, it’s also one of the most impressive flagships currently on the market, undercutting the competition while offering more in some key areas.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro price and release date What’s in the ‘Pro’? An OLED screen An f/1.6 dual-lens camera Lots of storage but no microSD slot or headphone port Design and display The best looking Mate yet Sleek mix of metal and glass Punchy screen but rivals are sharper. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro has a lot going for it. In addition to a slick, premium design, the screen packs vibrant, OLED technology with an 18:9 aspect ratio - similar to that found on the Google Pixel 2 XL and iPhone X .. Huawei’s Mate 10 Pro also has a dual camera set-up reminiscent of the excellent iPhone 8 Plus and Galaxy Note 8. It’s even loaded up with Android 8, the latest version of Google’s operating system, out of the box, meaning you get the operating system’s latest security features and UI highlights - such as picture-in-picture viewing.. When its specs are laid out alongside the rest of the flagship competition, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro even wins out in some key areas. For starters, it offers more storage - 128GB as standard vs 64GB on other flagships.. It also has a beefier battery than the competition - a huge 4,000mAh, compared with, 3,300mAh in the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and under 2,691mAh in the iPhone 8 Plus.. The Mate 10 Pro even has an IR blaster for some added nostalgia-factor, meaning it can double up as a TV remote control for those times you’re trying to spook your mates in the pub, or simply can’t find your own.. Even on paper though, this phone isn’t perfect. The screen isn't the sharpest at 1,080 x 2,160, putting it below the crystal clear 2K and even 4K displays on competing smartphones like the Sony Xperia XZ Premium .. It also has no headphone jack, or microSD card slot - so you’ll need to use a dongle for your wired headphones and guarantee the ample internal storage is enough to last you the entire life-cycle of the phone.. Update : Huawei announced that the Mate 10 Pro will be releasing in the US on February 18, with pre-orders open now. For those still deciding, Huawei's pre-order incentive is pretty sweet, including a $150 gift card from the retailer you purchase from.. The premium finish is compounded by the phone’s glass back. Thus far, the Huawei Mate series has always felt like the more niche, phablet series in the shadows of the Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus , but the Mate 10 Pro looks set to change that.. It isn’t the biggest mainstream phone on the block at the moment and Huawei is playing hardball on price, charging slightly less than its key competitors at €799 / £699 / AU$1,099 / $799.. The phone is available on EE, Three and O2 in the UK, plus you can buy it SIM free too. We've seen the phone on sale in Australia, too, and more recently Huawei announced that it's bringing the Pro to the US on GSM networks, like AT&T, T-Mobile and any other compatible MVNO for $799.. It will be available for pre-order through various popular retail channels like Amazon, Best Buy, B&H and Newegg starting February 4, coming with a $150 gift card until the phone releases on February 18.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro has launched alongside the Huawei Mate 10 , which, is very similar on paper to the Huawei Mate 9.. The main differences between the Mate 10 Pro and Mate 10 as a result, are also the main differences between the Mate 10 Pro and the Mate 9.. The Mate 10 Pro was launched alongside the chunkier Mate 10. For starters, Huawei has ditched IPS LCD screen technology for the Pro, instead opting for an OLED display - and it was absolutely the right call. Also ditched is the headphone jack and the microSD card slot - though there is double the storage in the model currently confirmed for release, at 128GB.. The Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro do share some key commonalities not found in the Mate 9 however. They both adopt glass backs for example, feeling instantly richer than the blasted metal of old. In addition, they sport the newest version of Android, complete with the newest version of Emotion UI, Huawei’s custom interface.. EMUI 8.0 as it’s also known enhances these two phones in a number of very tangible ways, the most notable being the PC experience generated when hooking them up to a monitor or TV using an HDMI cable.. It has a premium, IP67 rated glass body, but no headphone jack. The camera set-ups on the new Mates are similar to what we’ve seen on the Huawei Mate 9, P10 and P10 Plus, in so far as they offer dual-cameras, combining an RGB and a monochrome sensor. This time round though, Huawei has stepped things up in the aperture department, with f/1.6 lenses across each of the camera modules.. This should result in better low-light photographs, hitting home Huawei’s camera partnership with Leica.. Thanks to a couple of generations of manufacturing very good looking glass-backed phones under the Honor name, Huawei knows exactly what it’s doing with the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro.. A curved Gorilla Glass back panel combines with a metal frame to create a phone that looks sleek, feels rich and doesn’t disappoint alongside other phones in the same price-bracket.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro hands on gallery. The front of the phone is seriously screen-heavy, offering a 6-inch display experience while maintaining a smaller footprint than the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus.. Its 80.9% screen-to-bezel ratio also impresses compared to the classical iPhone 8 and 8 Plus design, though isn’t quite as light on bezels as the iPhone X. Like the iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and LG V30 though, the screen’s aspect ratio is ultra-wide with an 18:9 aspect ratio.. OLED technology with some added HDR10 support combine to gives the Mate 10 Pro’s display ample punch and pop - more than the comparatively muted Google Pixel 2 XL.. At full HD resolution though, it doesn’t have the clarity to compete with the likes of the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, Galaxy Note 8 and S8 series, nor is it quite as breathtaking with regards to color reproduction as the latter two.. HDR10 is supported on both the Mate 10 Pro hardware and software. Despite this though, it still fares better than the Google Pixel 2 and LG V30 when it comes to color integrity and viewing angles, positioning it firmly in the middle of the premium smartphone screen hierarchy.. Loaded up with a screen-protector pre-fitted, as well as a soft plastic case in the box, it’s also reassuring that you won’t have to make any additional investments to keep your pricey new smartphone protected from all sides.. Even without a case and screen protector though, the Mate 10 Pro is a sturdy contender thanks to Gorilla Glass 5 on both sides and IP67 water and dust resistance.. The glass back has a slight curve across both axis, softening the feel somewhat. It also seamlessly transitions into the high-gloss metal sides and produces a sufficiently easy to grip shape and texture combination.. Less slippery than blasted metal it may be, but thanks to all the glass, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro’s design is also much more fingerprint-friendly.. Like most flagships out now, the Mate 10 Pro has a dual-camera set-up. The dual-camera results in two mini camera bumps, while the fingerprint scanner has a nicely tactile recess to ensure a quick finger fumble will naturally find it.. While camera bumps aren’t ideal, as with the Google Pixel 2, the fact the cameras are physically independent discs of glass means that a smashed back won’t necessarily mean a smashed camera.. Easy to press buttons adorn the phone’s right-side, a USB-C port is at its base while the SIM tray sits on the left-side. This means that with no real complaints when it comes to the design and screen, save for the slightly irksome camera bumps, things have gotten off to an excellent start.. Add to that availability in four colors, Mocha Brown, Midnight Blue, Titanium Gray and Pink Gold, and there should be something for everyone in the Mate 10 Pro color portfolio - even if their communications strategy around the colors could do with some refining..

The 2016 Huawei Mate 9. was targeted at business-types who wanted a smartphone for productivity. We liked it, but the Mate 9 was undeniably unattractive. It apparently led Huawei to change its approach for phone’s successor, the Mate 10 Pro , because it exudes everything we want from a faithful smartphone companion. In our Huawei Mate 10 Pro review, we find out if the new phone can live up to its highly-polished looks.. The Mate 10 Pro is very pretty. Huawei has minimized the edges around the screen considerably, with thin slivers running down both sides of the 6-inch screen, much like the LG V30. and the Samsung Galaxy S8. The 18:9 screen dominates about 80 percent of the phone’s front panel, which means it’s not as bezel-free as the iPhone X. or the Xiaomi Mi Mix .. Supercar-levels of attractiveness await when you flip the phone over. It’s like the Mate 10 Pro has been cut from the body of a futuristic concept vehicle. Heat-treated glass for extra toughness curves at each side and covers the metal body, and a subtle but distinctive stripe surrounds the camera lenses. It’s smooth, cool to the touch, and catches the light in a beautifully eye-catching way. We love the blue model, but couldn’t resist our titanium review unit. It also comes in an equally delicious mocha brown. The color line-up for the Mate 10 Pro makes it hard to pick the best one; they’re all so tempting.. It’s not too slippery in the hand, but the curved body does tend to slide about on flat surfaces when placed face-up. A clear silicone case comes in the box, and we recommend using it or another case , not just for drop protection but also to avoid scratches on the glass body.. Supercar-levels of attractiveness await when you flip the phone over.. Everyday usability is enhanced by little things like the textured power button, which makes it easy for your finger to find without looking, and the excellent placement of the fingerprint sensor. This may depend on the size of your hand, but for us, it was perfect. Huawei’s fingerprint sensor is also one of the best in the business. It’s ridiculously fast, and accuracy is second to none, only being foiled by wet fingers. The slight camera lens bump assists with finding the sensor too, as you feel the very edge if your finger is slightly too far up the body.. Huawei has added IP67 water resistance to the Mate 10 Pro. It’s a welcome addition that offers a little peace of mind. If there is a problem, it’s that Huawei added water-resistance by dropping the 3.5mm headphone socket for the Mate 10 Pro. A dongle is included in the box, ready to plug into the USB Type-C charging port. What’s worse is Huawei uses Bluetooth 4.2 over the newer Bluetooth 5 standard , which offers improved range and data transfer speeds. It’s a baffling decision, and if Samsung can have a better water-resistance rating as well as headphone jack, so should Huawei.. The Huawei Mate series has previously been less attractive than Huawei’s P-series phones. The Mate 10 Pro is the best looking phone Huawei has produced, and it’s easily among the best of the year from any manufacturer.. The Mate 10 Pro’s body may be compact — it’s smaller than an iPhone 8 Plus. — but the screen measures 6-inches with an 18:9 aspect ratio, meaning it’s taller and thinner. It’s an OLED panel, like the new iPhone X, with a 2,160 x 1,080 pixel resolution, and it looks great. Despite the resolution not being as high as the non-Pro Mate 10 , it’s still sharp, detailed, and the colors are stunning. It’s an odd decision, but we haven’t found ourselves missing a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution.. Huawei has added HDR10 support to the Mate 10 Pro, and just like many modern televisions, it’s ready to enhance the color, black levels, and detail in compatible movies and TV shows. The problem is HDR10 mobile content. isn’t widespread, and Netflix hasn’t added the Mate 10 Pro to its supported devices list yet, so finding content is a challenge.. It’s sharp, detailed, and the colors are stunning.. This isn’t a small phone, so using the screen with one hand and a thumb isn’t an easy task. The height of the screen makes reaching up for the notification shade a challenge without some jiggling around. The good thing is you can swipe down on the fingerprint scanner to bring down notifications, though this setting is off by default.. We didn’t have any problems playing games, and using the interface. Typing is only a pleasure after installing Google’s Gboard. Huawei installed SwiftKey as the default option, and we found it frustrating to use, and less intuitive than Google’s keyboard found on many Android phones.. The new Kirin 970 octa-core processor drives the Mate 10 Pro, and performance excels. It’s the presence of the Neural Processing Unit, or NPU, that’s the headline grabber, as it’s purely to power complex artificial intelligence processing on device, rather than in the cloud. Although many of its benefits speed things up behind the scenes, you’ll see the NPU working in the camera and a translation app.. Running some benchmark apps, we can see how the Kirin 970 performs:. Benchmarks are great for making comparisons — the Mate 10 Pro beats the Galaxy S8 , but not the OnePlus 5, for example — but it’s not always illustrative of real world performance. The previous Kirin 960 was highly capable, and the Kirin 970 is a worthy successor. We played games like Happy Hop , Reckless Racing 3 , and Arena of Valor , without any issues. The phone didn’t get hot, we didn’t experience any slowdown or stuttering, and it did everything we asked, right when we asked it.. How about the NPU? Huawei talked a lot about its benefits at the Kirin 970’s launch, but in most everyday situations you probably won’t realize it’s there. It works with the Kirin 970 to increase efficiency, and keep your phone running optimally so it doesn’t succumb to slowdown issues as the device ages. We can’t judge this on the Mate 10 Pro yet, but the Mate 9 — which has similar features without the NPU — is still performing well after nearly a year with on-and-off use.. One of the ways you can see the NPU in action is to open Microsoft’s translator app. Translating something through the camera, with voice, or via typing, all happens much faster than if the app relied solely on the cloud. Information is processed locally, rather than sending it to a server and retrieving it. While this speeds up translation, it doesn’t improve it, so you get what the app thinks is correct. Results vary depending on the language, but this isn’t the fault of the Mate 10 Pro or the NPU.. The Kirin 970 and its NPU. have considerable potential for the future, and Huawei is putting massive resources. At the moment this hasn’t been fully realized, and probably isn’t something most people are going to notice in action. This may change in the future when developers start using its abilities in apps and services made for the phone. It’s therefore hard to know how it’s enhancing the phone at the moment; but it’s certainly not doing it any harm.. Huawei continues its partnership with Leica on the Mate 10 Pro, and has also added in some artificial intelligence smarts through the Neural Processing Unit. The rear camera is made up of two sensors: A 12-megapixel, f/1.6 aperture, RGB color lens with optical image stabilization, plus a 20-megapixel, f/1.6 aperture monochrome lens. Working together they offer a 2x optical zoom, a bokeh portrait mode, while using the monochrome lens separately you get amazing black and white images without the need for a filter.. Day or night, sunny or overcast, inside or outside, the pictures the Mate 10 Pro takes are stunning. Huawei has tasked the NPU with image recognition duties on the camera, so it understands if you’re pointing it at a sunny scene, an animal, or food, for example. It’s instant, and it tweaks the settings accordingly without you needing to open the manual Pro mode. While the technology is very cool, and the pictures are excellent, you never know what difference the NPU is truly making. We do like seeing the indicator suddenly pop up showing the scene setting, and it never got it wrong. It’s also hard to argue with the results, and we’re always pleased to see an innovative software feature that makes life easier.. The Mate 10 Pro’s camera is spectacular.. Monochrome mode now has a bokeh mode, and it’s offers great results. The 8-megapixel f/2.0 front camera takes bokeh shots that — in the right lighting, with the NPU’s assistance and some patience — takes attractive selfies. The built-in photo editing suite is comprehensive, and we like the hybrid zoom feature.. The camera turns itself off after a short while, requiring a screen tap to wake it up again, but it often happens when you’re trying to frame a shot. There’s also a mode that takes short videos called Moving Pictures, like Apple’s Live Photo, and it’s really superfluous. The Mate 10 Pro’s camera is brilliant, and you’ll want to use it at every opportunity.. The Mate 10 Pro runs Android 8.0 Oreo with Huawei’s EMUI 8.0 user interface over on top, and it also packs Google’s November Android Security Patch. All this means it’s just about as up-to-date as you can get right now. It’s not likely to last long, as Huawei’s track record with Android software updates isn’t great. While EMUI may get some attention, don’t expect Android itself to get the same love as you’ll find on a Google Pixel 2. If you can live with this, the EMUI experience is greatly improved over older phones, and has been since the introduction of EMUI 5.1 on the Huawei P9, P10, and Mate 9. It’s faster, and easier to use, despite Huawei’s flourishes. Enter the system settings and the options list is minimal but a little confusing, and although you can change the overall theme, EMUI’s icon design is often jarring and inconsistent. We’d rather have stock Android icons, around which many app’s base their own icons on, giving the UI a more consistent overall look.. That said, the wallpapers are pretty, and we like the standard Magazine lock screen wallpaper that changes each time you hit the sleep/wake key. Google Assistant works as expected, and you can delete almost all the pre-installed non-essential apps. Huawei’s EMUI is closer to Samsung’s TouchWiz and LG’s UI than ever before, but Huawei can’t resist adding in “features” to cure problems that aren’t there. Namely, the Navigation Dock: A little virtual joystick that controls navigation. The Android keys everyone is used to work perfectly well. All the Navigation Dock does is give you something new to learn, but we do like the way it makes it possible to have a full-screen display all the time.. App icons get Android Oreo’s little blobs telling you the app has new notifications. Split screen works well, and the implementation is logical and easy to understand without looking for assistance. Another great feature is Pocket PC, where all you need is a USB Type-C to HDMI cable to have a full-screen experience on a computer monitor or TV. It’s like Samsung DeX , but without the pricey dock. We’ll have to do more testing to see how well this works.. Huawei has completely removed battery anxiety.. Huawei has worked some magic on the lithe Mate 10 Pro. Inside is a massive 4000mAh battery that has lasted us two full days between charges. Huawei has completely removed battery anxiety, and that’s a rarity these days, even with other smartphones with relatively large batteries such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. There’s plenty of software trickery making this possible, and power management has evolved into a true Huawei speciality.. Charging is also spectacularly fast, zipping to full in about 90 minutes using Huawei’s proprietary SuperCharge technology, which does mean you’ll always need the specific charger and USB cable to make it work.. This is not a cheap smartphone. Huawei is playing with the big boys not only in terms of making a winning smartphone, but also in charging a lot for it. In Europe, the Mate 10 Pro costs 800 euros, or around $945; and in the U.S. the phone will retail for $800. Pre-orders start on February 4, and the Mate 10 Pro goes on sale on February 18. There is no carrier support, but you can purchase it from Amazon , Best Buy , Huawei, B&H , and Newegg. If you buy from any of these retailers, you’ll get $150 in credit to use on the same online retailer.. The warranty in the U.K. covers the phone for two years, and the battery for six months. If you break it by accident, the warranty won’t cover it. Should you need to get the phone repaired or replaced, you’ll need to visit a Huawei service center. When the phone is available in the U.S., the warranty may depend on the retailer.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro Compared To. Huawei gets the design, camera, screen, and battery exactly right on the Mate 10 Pro, while the NPU and AI smarts show promise for the future. It’s an exceptional all-round smartphone package we highly recommend.. Huawei has produced its best smartphone in a year when every other manufacturer has also stepped up its game, making competition really tough. is LG’s best phone yet, the Galaxy Note 8. is supremely capable and has a brilliant camera, just like the Pixel 2 XL , and the HTC U11. may have been overshadowed by the iPhone X , but both are excellent smartphones worth your money. It’s impossible not to recommend the cheaper OnePlus 5. Pretty much every other flagship smartphone released in 2017 is a worthy alternative to the Mate 10 Pro. Not because the Mate 10 Pro is bad, just because it and everything else is so good.. The Mate 10 Pro has IP67 water resistance, so it’ll survive a light dowsing, but not prolonged immersion in water. The body is made of glass — Gorilla Glass 5 — and is fragile like all glass phones. Put it in a case if you’re clumsy, or care about keeping the finish looking its best. The software is right up-to-date now, but it won’t stay that way for long, and Huawei isn’t fast at releasing new Android versions. This could leave your phone vulnerable to security problems, and the only way to guarantee updates is to buy a Google Pixel 2 phone.. Outside of the software, the hardware is cutting edge, and will easily last you through a two-year contract and beyond. Additionally, the real power and benefits of the NPU will come into play over time, as more apps and services begin to utilize its ability, so the Mate 10 Pro may actually improve with age.. Yes, and for once you can without using an importer, because the Huawei Mate 10 Pro is coming to the U.S.. The OLED screen is beautiful, the camera is fantastic, there’s masses of power, the battery lasts for a couple of days, and it’s damn good-looking too.

The Huawei Mate 10 Pro stretches the limits of what justifies the word “pro” in a product name, even in the hype-driven tech world. It might look more impressive than the regular Mate 10, which sports a front-facing fingerprint scanner, but both models have the same chip and camera components. The Mate 10 Pro actually has a lower -resolution screen, and. Huawei has abandoned the headphone jack and microSD storage slot that remain on the cheaper model.. But even with an identity crisis, the Mate 10 Pro is the kind of flagship phone you’d expect from Samsung and Google: packed with premium features, and oozing with power and performance. While it will no doubt struggle to compete with the likes of the Galaxy Note 8 and Google Pixel 2 XL once it releases in the U.S. (mainly due to a lack of carrier support), Huawei has nonetheless proven that it’s worthy of its No. 2 position on the smartphone charts.. The Mate 10 Pro flips Huawei's flagship feature strategy compared to the Mate 9 Pro—for better or worse. Where last year’s top-of-the-line phone was the one with the front-facing fingerprint sensor, for instance, Huawei relegates that to the non-pro model this year. Following the lead of other high-end competition, the fingerprint sensor's new location is on the Mate 10 Pro's backplate.. The back of the Mate 10 Pro is made of glass, but it still doesn’t support wireless charging.. The Mate 10 Pro also echoes its peers in the wide curves of its corners, much like the Pixel 2 XL's. The only real identifying marker is the reflective Huawei name on the chin (which I could do without).. At 7.9mm, the Mate 10 Pro is a touch thinner than the 8.2mm Mate 10, but the slimness comes at a price: The Mate 10 Pro doesn’t have a headphone jack (though it does include a USB-C adapter and USB-C earphones in the box). Huawei blames that on its desire to have IP67 water resistance, but that argument doesn’t really float, since it’s not an either-or proposition on Galaxy phones.. The Mate 10 Pro has a few other compromises. It doesn’t offer expandable storage, though the feature is available on the regular Mate 10. Also, despite moving from aluminum to glass for the backplate, there’s still no support for wireless charging.. The Mate 10 Pro's display should be its crowning glory, but it's not. Huawei has brought back the OLED screen from last year’s Mate Pro, but in a curious move, it’s decreased the resolution. While the Mate 9 Pro had a best-in-class 1440×2560 Quad HD display with a 534ppi density, the 18:9 Mate 10 Pro only packs a 6-inch Full HD 1080x2160 screen with a 402ppi density. Confusingly, the regular Mate 10’s 5.9-inch, 16:9 LCD actually has a higher 1440x2560 resolution.. Huawei’s Mate 10 Pro has a fine display, but it has a lower-resolution than its peers.. That being said, the Mate 10 Pro’s screen has its charms. It has a vivid setting (like the Pixel 2 XL), but flipping the toggle creates a much more noticeable difference on the Mate 10 Pro, with vibrant reds and greens, and extraordinarily deep blacks. Colors are more realistic in normal mode, but they’re still bold and lively.. If I didn’t know the Mate 10 Pro had a 1080p screen instead of a 1440p one, I probably wouldn’t have suspected anything was amiss. Still, it’s upsetting that a high-end phone would have a measurably lesser screen than an entry-level one, even if it is OLED vs. Huawei seems to be defining pro by screen ratio rather than resolution , and it’s giving users a tricky choice in the process: more pixels or more height.. Once again, Huawei has made its own silicon for the flagship Mate phone, forgoing the popular Snapdragon 835 chip. Like Apple and its A series chips, this serves the Mate 10 Pro well—it's easily the fastest Android phone I’ve ever used.. What the Mate 10 Pro lacks in ports, it makes up for in speed.. Surely the speediness of app switching was helped by the 6GB of RAM in my test unit (a 4GB version is also available), but even in raw speed tests, the Mate 10 Pro's Kirin 970 professor performed at least as well as the Note 8 and Pixel 2 XL, both of which showcase Qualcomm’s latest chip.. Huawei says the real performance benefits of the chip can be seen in the dedicated neural network processing unit, a unique AI-powered architecture dedicated to boosting the productivity and efficiency of your phone. While you won’t see it working most of the time, Huawei says the NPU offers 25 times the performance and 50 times the energy efficiency when compared to a “dumb” version of the same chip. It also says the Mate 10 will stay speedy over time, as the NPU keeps OxygenOS from getting bogged down. Obviously I wasn’t able to test these claims, but after witnessing the NPU in action in other areas, I have no reason to doubt them.. Like last year, Huawei has fitted the Mate 10 Pro with a massive 4,000mAh battery, and thanks to the Kirin 970’s power management capabilities, it lasts even longer this year. Furthermore, the bundled SuperCharge charger fills up about half the battery in a half-hour.. Huawei’s Mate 10 sips battery juice in standby mode, even when the always-on display is active.. In straight benchmarks, the Mate 10 Pro powers past every Android phone I’ve tested, lasting for an impressive 9 hours and 18 minutes. For those keeping score, that’s better than last year’s Mate and the Galaxy S8+, the previous benchmark leaders.. But while the Mate 10 powers through a day and then some, it’s actually more impressive when you’re not using it. Standby life isn’t something I usually test when reviewing a new phone, but the Mate 10’s is too good to ignore. With the always-on display turned on, I lost an average of 1 to 1.5 percent per hour of downtime versus an average of 2 percent for other Snapdragon 835 phones. When I turned off the always-on display (or used the super-handy scheduling function), I barely noticed any battery loss at all. In fact, over a 12-hour period, the Mate 10 Pro lost just 3 percent in total, meaning it could conceivably sit in a bag for a couple of weeks without needing a charge.. The battery seemed to get even better as time went on. While I lost around 11 percent of my battery over the course of my first nights without plugging in, two nights later I lost just 7 percent over the same six-and-a-half-hour time period. That’s the NPU’s machine learning in action, Huawei says, and it’s hard to argue with the results. The companion chip is able to dial back background processes when the phone isn’t in use, making it last even longer than the benchmarks say: I routinely had between 30 and 40 percent at the end of a normal day of use with my Mate 10 Pro, measurably better than the Note 8 and the Pixel 2 XL's performance under similar circumstances.. Flip over the Mate 10 Pro and you'll find a vertically mounted, Leica-branded dual camera setup with a dignified reflective stripe.. Both Mate 10s have the same camera, and its specs are in line with what you’d expect from a premium phone. The dual system pairs a 20MP monochrome lens with a 12MP RGB one, and both have f/1.6 aperture, the best you’ll find in a smartphone. There’s also optical image stabilization in the main lens, dual LED flash, and phase detection autofocus.. The Huawei Mate 10 has a Leica-branded camera, but it’s still not clear what kind of benefits that brings.. The camera is once again Leica-branded, but it's hard to quantify exactly what that brings to the table other than a familiar name. In my testing, I found the Google Pixel 2 performed slightly better overall. In adequate light, its photos were virtually indistinguishable from the Pixel 2's and Galaxy Note 8's. The OIS and aperture kept low-light pictures looking decent, too. However, in harsh light it took an extra second or two to focus, causing it to miss details that the other cameras caught. Overall, however, the Mate 10 Pro offers a fantastic camera phone, one that’s easily on a par with Android’s bests.. In harsh low light, the Mate 10’s f/1.6 aperture (left) was no match for the superior processing power of the Note 8 (center) and Pixel 2 XL (right).. The Mate 10 Pro (left) was able to understand this unconventional portrait better than the Note 8 (center) and Pixel 2 XL (right), and it performed well with actual faces, too.. Like the Pixel phones, a lot of the Mate 10’s picture-taking abilities have nothing to do with the actual hardware, but rather the heavy lifting done behind the scenes thanks to the NPU. Most notably, Huawei has 13 shooting modes that trigger automatically when the camera detects something it recognizes, such as a face or a flower.. When the camera sees food, it switches modes, as evidenced by the fork-and-knife icon.. The shooting modes are my favorite feature of the Mate 10 Pro. I loathe most camera apps’ settings and menu screens, and on the Mate 10, I barely had to visit them. Even accessing the pro controls is easy, via a simple swipe upward above the shutter. It’s a close call between the Mate 10 Pro and the LG V30 as to my favorite camera app, but ease of use definitely goes to the Mate 10 Pro.. Huawei has jumped its EMUI OS from version 5.0 to version 8.0 for no other reason than to brag that it’s one of the first phones to ship with Android Oreo out of the box. It’s a nice surprise, as many newer handsets haven’t yet made the leap, but it’s not nearly as big a deal as Huawei—or the three skipped version numbers—would have you believe.. The bundled Microsoft Translator app uses the Mate 10 Pro’s NPU to deliver speedy, accurate translations.. The biggest change (in addition to the regular Oreo features such as picture-in-picture and notification dots) is the addition of a navigation dock. Instead of the static navigation keys at the bottom of the screen, you can opt to overlay a circle on the screen to go home, back, and see recent apps. It's one of those features that's different rather than better than the stock solution, and I turned it off pretty quickly.. A specialized version of Microsoft’s Translator app works with the NPU to deliver speedy translations. In my testing, it worked very well, and it’s good that Huawei didn’t set out to build its own (possibly inferior) version.. Other than that, EMUI 8 is pretty similar to EMUI 5. The overly skeuomorphic icons remain, but you can tweak the appearance somewhat via the theme store. It still has the best lock screen in the business, courtesy of a rotating library of images and a small pedometer above the time. I love the double-knock gesture that simplifies the screenshot gesture, though I found myself getting it mixed up with the common double-tap-to-wake gesture (which EMUI doesn't have).. Slapping a pro moniker on a phone generally implies that it’s the best version of that particular model, but that’s not exactly the case with the Mate 10 Pro. Compared to the cheaper Mate 10, it has a lower-resolution screen, no headphone jack, and no expandable storage. The only real benefits come in the form of a sleeker design and OLED screen.. Huawei won’t let you forget you’re using a Huawei phone.. For most people that probably won’t be worth the $100 premium Huawei is charging internationally for the 64GB Mate 10 Pro. It might be a moot point in the U.S. anyway, since we don’t know yet whether the Mate 10 Pro is actually releasing stateside. But if you don’t mind the home button, the non-pro Mate 10 is clearly the better deal here. It has the same chip, camera, and battery, and you get a headphone jack. And the screen is just 0.1 inches smaller.. That’s not to say you shouldn’t buy the Mate 10 Pro. If you don’t mind the display deficiencies, it’s one of the best handsets of the year, with tremendous battery life, incredible speed, and good looks. I just wish the delineation between the models were a little more straightforward. I personally don’t like home buttons, but $100 is a lot to pay to get rid of it. And the technical knowledge that you’re buying a lower-res screen is probably a non-starter for some people.. Going pro shouldn’t be about sacrifices, and with the Mate 10 Pro, you might feel like you’ve made too many of them..

Huawei Mate 10 Pro: Everything you need to know!. This is everything you need to know about the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro!. For the past few years, Huawei's Mate series has been its flagship chock full of high-end hardware, a beefy battery and the latest and greatest cameras. That tradition continued in 2017, with a slight twist: in addition to the Mate 10, Huawei also released an even better Mate 10 Pro .. This is everything you need to know about the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro!. We've had our hands on the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro since their announcement, and we have two full reviews for the Mate 10 Pro.

One inescapable truth of the U.S. cell phone market is that a vast majority of consumers buy their phones from their wireless carrier. Any companies that want to sell a significant amount of phones in the US needs to cuddle up to the carriers. It looked like 2018 would finally be the year Huawei found a friend in AT&T .. At CES 2018 , that agreement came crashing down. AT&T scrapped the deal over political concerns, but the Mate 10 Pro will still be available through Best Buy, Amazon, Newegg, Microsoft and B&H Photos starting in February, 2018.. Later, the heads of the FBI, CIA and NSA informed the Senate Intelligence Committee that Huawei phones and telecommunications equipment provides the Chinese government access to American telecommunications infrastructure. Despite this, Huawei's networking equipment and cell phones are sold in over 170 countries worldwide, and there is no evidence that the Chinese government has backdoor access to these networks.. More: Huawei Mate 10 Pro coming to the US in Feb, but carrier deal is dead. government's beef with Huawei isn't really about phones. Huawei uses the sub brand Honor for western markets so customers don't have to figure out how to pronounce Huawei, and Honor handsets have a tendency to mirror existing products from Huawei. That trend continues with the Honor View 10. That phone uses the same internals as the Mate 10 Pro, the same display, and the same software. The main difference comes down to build: the View 10 uses a metal casing while the Mate 10 Pro is a glass sandwich. The other big difference is the cameras: the Mate 10 Pro takes much better photos than the View 10.. More: Huawei Mate 10 Pro vs. Do you have more questions about the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro?

No headphone jack or microSD slot.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro is a powerful phone that uses a dedicated AI processor to improve camera capabilities and day-to-day performance.. Apple and Google may have machine learning, but Huawei has artificial intelligence. The Mate 10 Pro is the first phone with a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU), letting it run AI computations with greater efficiency than a CPU or GPU. Processing smarts aside, it also has a sleek glass body, an edge-to-edge display, and promising dual camera sensors, along with all the other premium features you'd expect on a high-end Android phone. We spent some time with the Mate 10 Pro and its slightly less powerful sibling, the Mate 10, and have some initial impressions.. Unlike the aluminum Mate 9 , the Mate 10 Pro features an all-glass body that curves along the back for a comfortable grip. There's a distinct reflective stripe that runs horizontally across the top of the phone where the camera is located. Colors include midnight blue, mocha brown, pink gold, and titanium gray. The look is sleek and attractive, though fingerprints show up easily. A special Porsche Design Mate 10 features a vertical reflective strip, similar to the racing stripe on car.. The phone measures 6.1 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 6.3 ounces, making it a little bigger and heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces) despite having a similar overall form factor. You'll find most of the standard buttons and ports, with the exception of a headphone jack; you have to use the USB-C port or Bluetooth for audio. There's a fingerprint sensor on the back, below the camera and within easy reach of your index finger. The phone is IP67 waterproof, so it can handle immersion in five feet of water for up to 30 minutes. Alas, there's no microSD card slot.. There are two SIM card slots, both capable of providing 4G LTE data with VoLTE. The phone is also capable of blazing fast Cat. 18 speeds (up to 1.2Gbps) with 4x4 MIMO.. The glass look continues on the front, where the 6-inch AMOLED screen has a tall and narrow 18:9 aspect ratio, similar to the Galaxy and LG V30. That makes it easy to reach across with your thumb. There's also a floating display dock (basically an on-screen home button), along with a one-handed mode that shrinks the keyboard to the side to make it more accessible.. View All 13 Photos in Gallery. There is one obvious downside to the display. For a flagship phone, the resolution is a relatively low 2,160 by 1,080, making it less sharp than the Quad HD panels you find on the S8, V30 , and even the smaller Mate 10. So while you get the rich, saturated colors and perfect blacks AMOLED displays are known for, very fine details aren't quite as sharp as they appear on other screens. That said, viewing angles are good, and screen brightness reaches an impressive 730 nits, making for solid outdoor visibility.. The 5.9-inch Mate 10, meanwhile, shares a similar design with a glass back and reflective stripe, but instead of a rear fingerprint sensor you'll find it on the front. It measures 5.9 by 3.1 by 0.3 inches and weighs 6.7 ounces. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a microSD card slot, but it isn't waterproof. C onnectivity is limited to Cat. 16 up to 1Gbps, and there's no 4x4 MIMO.. The Mate 10 Pro is powered by a Kirin 970 processor, the first chipset to have a Neural Processing Unit. This provides it with AI computational abilities that allow it to do things like recognize images (more on that later) and perform on-the-fly language translations. Using the preloaded Microsoft Translate app, I was able to immediately translate a sign from Chinese to English.. See How We Test Cell Phones. The NPU also helps to identify usage patterns and offer suggestions to improve your experience. For instance, the phone will pick up on when you're using it for reading, as well as the reading environment around you, and offer suggestions like enabling eye-care mode. In addition, an AI-powered performance engine allows for better memory management and app response.. There's also 6GB RAM and 128GB of storage, giving you plenty of power for multitasking and gaming. I didn't get to run any benchmarks, but launching multiple apps and switching between them was smooth despite a heavy custom UI layer. Generally, it felt as fast as other top-tier Android phones I've used recently.. Others specs include a large 4,000mAh battery that should get you through a full day of use without any difficulty. Huawei says you can expect 20 hours of video playback or 20 hours of 4G web browsing, which are pretty bold claims, and we'll put the phone through our own battery rundown test when we review it. Huawei's proprietary SuperCharge standard should be able to juice you up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes. There's no wireless charging support, however.. Huawei sticks to the Leica camera setup from the Mate 9. Both the Mate 10 and 10 Pro have a primary 20-megapixel monochrome sensor paired with a 12-megapixel RGB sensor, both with f/1.6 aperture for improved low-light performance. The two sensors work together to create high-quality images. There's also an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. The phones have optical image stabilization, support 2x optical zoom, and are capable of 4K video recording.. Hardware aside, it's once again the AI engine that stands out. Using the NPU, the Mate 10 Pro is capable of identifying objects in real time and intelligently adjusting the camera settings to take the best picture possible. This goes beyond simple automatic mode because the NPU can factor in all aspects of scenery, not just simple ISO adjustments. It'll use different settings for scenic shots compared with a plate of food, for instance. Your selfies are AI-powered as well, and Huawei assured me that all the calculations happen on the phone itself, with nothing stored in the cloud.. I took several test shots with both devices during my hands on, and I was generally impressed with clarity and color reproduction, though I'll need to put them through more extensive testing to see how they compare with top camera phones like the Galaxy Note 8 , especially in low light.. The Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro both run Android 8.0 Oreo with Huawei's EMUI 8.0 software on top. It's a fairly heavy UI layer that removes the app drawer, placing all yours apps across the home screen, along with some other visual changes.. Beyond that, you get a number of special features like the aforementioned floating navigation dock. The dock can be placed anywhere on the screen and functions as a second home button. When you disable the software keys you can use different swipe gestures for the Back and Recent buttons. There's a Smart Split Screen mode that uses AI to identify the context of what's happening. For instance, if you're watching a video and you get a phone call or text, the phone will deliver an unobtrusive notification allowing you to immediately launch into split-screen mode so your video isn't interrupted.. Perhaps the most interesting productivity feature is the ability to easily connect the phone to a monitor or TV. Using only a USB-C-to-DisplayPort cable (or an adapter), you can simply plug the phone into a bigger screen and run Desktop mode, similar to what Samsung DeX does, except no dock is required. The phone can also connect to up to two Bluetooth devices at a time, letting you hook it up to a keyboard and mouse. Otherwise, its touch screen doubles as a virtual touchpad.. I found the experience to be seamless. The phone booted into desktop mode shortly after plugging in, and despite some minor latency (which may have been due to the TV), I was able to open a number of apps and windows including the photo gallery, notes, and browser without any issue. It's also possible to continue using your phone while Desktop mode is running, letting you privately receive texts or phone calls without it showing up on the big screen.. US pricing and availability details haven't been announced, but we expect the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro to fall in line with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8. Depending on price, they could be solid alternatives to other big-screen Android phones. Stay tuned for more details and full reviews.. Bottom Line: The Huawei Mate 10 Pro is a powerful phone that uses a dedicated AI processor to improve camera capabilities and day-to-day performance..

What is the Huawei Mate 10 Pro?. Huawei Mate 10 Pro – Design. Huawei Mate 10 Pro – Display. Huawei Mate 10 Pro – Software. Huawei Mate 10 Pro – Performance. If you’re on the market for a new phablet, but don’t want to spend the small fortune required to get a Galaxy Note 8 or iPhone X , then the Huawei Mate 10 Pro may well be your next phone.. The Mate 10 Pro is the only phablet the company’s currently selling in the UK, with Huawei having chosen not to range its slightly more affordable, regular Huawei Mate 10 .. The Pro offers fantastic hardware, with highlights including a Mobile HDR-ready OLED screen, super-fast CPU, more memory than you can shake a stick at, and excellent battery life.. This plus its wallet-friendly (relatively speaking) £699 price tag make it a compelling choice for any fan of big-screen phones. My only minor quibble is that the Mate 10 Pro’s EMUI Android skin still comes with a load of annoying, niggling flaws.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro has a close-to-identical design to the regular Mate 10, which is no bad thing.. The design takes the same mixed metal-and-glass approach as the Galaxy Note 8 or iPhone X. The slightly curved glass back, coupled with the sturdy metal sides and near-bezel-less front, makes the Pro one of the prettiest phablets on the market. The slim bezel also means the Pro doesn’t feel terribly unwieldy, despite packing a 6-inch screen.. Outside of this you’ll find all the trimmings expected of a 2017 flagship. On the back, just below the dual Leica-branded cameras, you’ll find a fingerprint scanner, which during my tests proved fast and reliable.. At the bottom you’ll see the increasingly common USB-C charging port and a speaker which, while not the loudest around, is more than good enough for video calling.. Unlike on cheaper phones the glass back here offers next to no flex and is surprisingly scratch-resistant. After accidentally throwing it in a pocket alongside loose change, the Pro emerged unscathed. The IP67 certification also rang true, with the Pro surviving my attempt to drown it in a kitchen. I still wouldn’t trust the glass back to survive a drop onto a hard surface, however.. The 128GB of inbuilt storage is also more than big enough for most users, and means the absence of a microSD card slot isn’t that big of a deal.. My only minor quibble with the phone’s design is that, unlike its sibling the Mate 10, the Pro doesn’t have a 3.5mm headphone jack. I know I’m fighting a losing battle, as everyone has already jumped on Apple’s ‘no 3.5mm’ bandwagon, but for me and many music fans, the port’s absence is still a sticking point..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. The big difference between the Mate 10 Pro and the regular mate 10 is that the Pro has an OLED, not LCD, screen.. Specifically the Pro comes with a 6-inch HD+ HDR 10 OLED display, while the regular Mate 10 comes with a more basic 5.8-inch quad-HD HDR10 LCD screen.. Some people may complain about the seemingly lower resolution, but the truth is that the Pro’s 2160 x 1080 pixel count is more than good enough. Even if you try your absolute hardest you’re not going to spot individual pixels.. The OLED panel is also one of the best on the market at the moment. Unlike Google’s Pixel 2 XL, the screen isn’t horribly calibrated and, while a smidgen warm, colours generally look nicely vibrant without making the jump into oversaturated territory.. Whites aren’t as clean as a well-set-up IPS panel, but they’re not the dirtiest I’ve seen on an OLED and are pleasingly free from the yellow or blue shift I see on competing AMOLED-screened phones. Brightness levels are also insanely high and meet the Mobile HDR 10 standard. However, given the current lack of high-dynamic-range content available to the Mate 10 Pro, I can’t currently comment on HDR performance.. On the whole, the Mate 10 Pro’s screen is one of the best you’ll find at this price point.. Huawei’s always struggled with mobile software, thanks to its insistence on using its own EMUI skin. Traditionally this has warped whatever Android version its laid over to near unrecognisable levels, making needles UI changes and adding more third-party bloatware and duplicate apps than could easily be counted.. Despite coming on leaps and bounds, and Huawei having managed to load the Pro with the Google’s latest Android 8 Oreo software, this problem remains the same on the Mate 10 Pro. Emotion UI still completely reworks key things, like Android’s settings menu, making it difficult to find the exact option you’re looking for. It also removes the app tray from the main menu.. Despite a radically reduced amount of bloatware, you’ll also still find pointless duplicate applications for things like music, calendar and messaging that offer at best equivalent features to Android’s native apps.. The only positive software additions I can spot focus on the Mate 10 Pro’s new AI-infused Kirin 970 processor.. According to Huawei its latest eight-core CPU comes with a specially made ‘Neural processing unit’ that adds a number of performance optimising ‘AI’ features. The unit apparently lets the phone learn and eventually predict your usage patterns to preemptively launch or tweak applications to meet your needs.. As an added perk the AI will also know when to shut down unneeded processes to save battery and avoid performance degradation over time. I won’t be able to confirm Huawei’s performance-degradation claims until I’ve used the phone a little longer – it’s usually a few months before you notice any slowdown. – but during my fortnight with the Mate 10 Pro, I’ve found it to be wonderfully nippy.. Paired with 6GB of RAM, which quite frankly is overkill on a phone, the Kirin chipset blitzed through every task I threw at it. Multi-tab web browsing was slick, and apps and games opened within milliseconds. Phone calls were stable and pleasingly free of dropouts, and the Mate 10 Pro played demanding 3D games smoothly. Its EMUI software is also stabler than past versions I’ve tested, and outside of a couple of application crashes I’m yet to experience any serious bugs or glitches.. The Mate 10 Pro’s synthetic benchmark scores mirrored my real-world experience and matched the performance of competing 2017 flagships. You can see how its scores compare to the Galaxy S8 in the table below.. My only slight concern is that, with prolonged intensive use, the Pro does begin to noticeably heat up. Looping Riptide GP2 I did notice some CPU throttling after an hour, though given how few people I can see running games for that long, this isn’t a huge deal.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

Huawei Mate 10 Pro review: Addicted after just one week. Now available to preorder in the US. Huawei Mate 9 review: The first choice, not the alternative. Huawei P10 Plus hands-on review: Finally a mini Mate 9. I've been testing the Huawei Mate 10 Pro for a week now. While performance, battery life and software have been further improved, the camera in particular makes a big leap forward. Read more about this in our full review of the Mate 10 Pro.. preorder in the US starting today,. You can scroll down to find out more about this in the "release date and price" section.. ✓ Battery can last a weekend. ✓ Dual SIM (Open Market version BLA-L29 only). ✕ There is no headphone jack socket. ✕ HDMI adapter for Easy Projection neither included nor available from Huawei. ✕ More fragile design than before. Lowest price: Huawei Mate 10 Pro. Huawei Mate 10 Pro release date and price. Huawei Mate 10 Pro arrives in. What color would you choose? Mocha, gray or blue?. Most Mate 10 Pro versions will have two SIM slots. The Mate 10 Pro was launched in the UK and Australia. in mid-November 2017 for €799 (about £710), and a Porsche Design version in the UK for. Preorders began as of today (February 4). in the US, and will be fully released on February 18.. Available through Amazon, Best Buy, B&H and Newegg, the unlocked version of the smartphone costs. $150 gift card for a limited time. It's important to note that it will not work with Verizon, Sprint and US Cellular, but it is compatible with. GSM/LTE carriers (T-Mobile, AT&T, Cricket, etc.). You won't need to wait around for any software updates, as it will. If you're willing to pay more, you can also preorder the Porsche design through amazon, which will set you back. $1,225 (more than the iPhone X ). The phone comes in three colors—‘Mocha Brown’, ‘Titanium Gray’ and ‘Midnight Blue’. The pink variant will only be available in China for the time being. Judging from the past though, it would not be surprising if Huawei releases a further color in time for the holiday season.. There are no variants as far as memory—every Mate 10 Pro comes with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB storage. There are different SIM versions though. Service provider-locked editions are expected to have only one SIM slot, while unlocked editions will have two SIM slots. If the dual SIM feature is paramount for you, you’ll have to ask your provider which version they have when the Mate 10 Pro is available. The dual SIM model is one of the few that can use LTE on both cards in parallel—useful in times of VoLTE and All-IP.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro design and build quality. The Mate 10 Pro has a modern bezel-less design. The screen protector catches the first scratches. The glass back and curves make the phone feel slimmer. The aluminium edge blends smoothly into the glass. The new glossy stripe on top becomes the brand's new design feature. On the left a P10 Plus (5.5 inches), on the right the Mate 10 Pro (6 inches). Huawei has overhauled the Mate design with the Mate 10 Pro. Even last year’s Mate 9 Porsche Edition pales in comparison. But this fantastic design may come at the expense of the device’s durability. Huawei jumped on the designed-to-break trend using a glaze on the Mate 10 Pro’s front and rear. Only the aluminum frame holds the device together in a reasonably stable manner. the latest victim of the new high-gloss finish. After all, the device had to feature IP67 certified protection against dust and water.. The aluminium frame is polished to a high gloss finish and merges seamlessly into the two glass surfaces. The transparent silicone bumper, which is supplied free of charge, and the standard protective film for the display keep the first signs of use temporarily away from the Mate 10 Pro.. After a week, the tested Mate 10 Pro still looked like new; apart from small bruises in the protective equipment. But we will have another look at this in a year's time.. At the hands-on presentation we had already been told that the antennas for LTE Cat. 18 would be present in the aluminum design as it would have been possible with the predecessor. true, since Huawei has decided not to use the GB-fast LTE in the Mate 10 non-Pro, but offers the tried and tested rugged aluminium design.. Unlike the Mate 9 Pro, the Pro version of the Mate 10 dispenses with the dual-edge design and serves the fans of conventional flat displays. Curved Glass is only located on the back and ensures that the device feels leaner in the grip than it actually is. In the back, a "Signature Stripe" decorates the main camera area and provides the new identification mark of the Mate series.. The display edges above and below the display shrink to a few millimeters. The new 2:1 format (as always marketed as "18:9") gives us a 6-inch display in a body that would have been able to accommodate only a 5.5-inch display in previous models. Indeed, the compact feel makes a good impression.. The display captivates with its brilliant colors and sharpness. Just like with the Mate 9 Pro / Porsche Design , the Mate 10 Pro features an AMOLED display. Together with a night mode, smart automatic brightness control and a dark user interface design, Huawei emphasizes. the enhanced contrast of the technology.. It resolves to just under 403 ppi, has the new 2:1 format and relies heavily on Android's integrated split-screen system to take advantage of the new widescreen format.. After the first week the colors are always rich, the contrasts are rich and there are no problems with AMOLED like a burn-in effect. However, as the technology tends to age prematurely, this section requires long-term observation.. Which devices are getting Android Oreo, and when. Use some cheap Type C HDMI adapter for Huawei's Easy Projection. Easy Projection makes the smartphone a simple PC replacement. The Mate 10 debuts Huawei’s Oreo-based EMUI 8.0. This new version replaces the Nougat-based EMUI 5, and provides drastic artificial intelligence enhancements in addition to the Oreo core features. The brand-new Neural Processing Unit in the chipset will be automatically accessed by future apps. in order to exploit performance advantages in particular.. So far, however, there is little evidence of this.. The EMUI update from version 5 to 8 suggests a bigger jump than you can actually see. Older devices like the Mate 9 or the Huawei P10/Plus will also receive the update to that version. We have also installed EMUI 8 on our Editorial Mate-8 as part of the beta program. So we'll list only the EMUI-8 features that you'll find exclusively on the Mate 10 Pro.. First and foremost, the Mate 10 Pro stands out with the so-called Easy Projection. transforms the Mate 10 Pro into a simple desktop using a standard adapter from Type C to HDMI. Unfortunately, there are still many limits to the current implementation and it still needs to be expanded. However, it already shows great potential for. Our test device has received an update within the first week. This fixed a serious problem that caused a massive battery drain in connection with Google Play services. After the update, which could be installed without resetting to factory defaults, the power problem disappeared and the Mate 10 Pro was able to achieve the promised battery life.. Huawei pursues a hard-working update policy and provides updates for most of its devices on a monthly basis for two years from the date of introduction, and can therefore be classified as reliable and secure.. Introducing Huawei's new smartphone brain, the Kirin 970. As the hardware star feature, the new Kirin 970 chipset has become more energy-efficient than the previous 960 due to 10nm technology, but the CPU and GPU remain otherwise largely unchanged. The Mate 10 Pro only delivers its performance advantage from the Neural Processing Unit (NPU), which is supposed to be designed specifically for future AR and VR tasks.. The NPU was also well advertised in the event. So what exactly is it good for? Currently, that added value is limited to just a few Huawei-specific apps. In the long term, Huawei wants to accelerate third-party apps with the NPU. Together with Microsoft, Huawei has pre-installed a translator app on the Huawei Mate 10 Pro, which translates text modules from one language into another of 40 other languages at unbelievable speeds—and without an internet connection, it still performs at Google level. The NPU’s impressive talents don’t end there. There are some impressive ways it enhances camera use too, which we explore in the section below.. The Mate 10’s 128 GB UFS-2.1 memory is fast and plentiful. But a MicroSD slot can still be practical for various reasons. Unfortunately, just like the Mate 9 Pro/Porsche Design and other recent phones, MicroSD is missing in the Huawei Mate 10 Pro.. The speaker at the bottom becomes a side stereo speaker in landscape format. Another NPU application is the normalization of call volume. If you whisper into the phone because you have a cold and your voice is ‘just not very good’, the volume adapts to project the voice at normal volume on the other end of the call. Conversely, if your counterpart answers particularly loudly, his voice will normally reach you loudly but at a slightly moderated level.. But, if there is a lot of noise in your surroundings, the Mate 10 Pro lifts the output of the loudspeaker accordingly and makes sure that you understand your caller well. If you speak then into the Mate 10 Pro, your caller won’t hear any of the noise around you thanks to intelligent filtering. Huawei has traditionally been one of the best in the field of speech quality, so we can hardly wait to test this feature out in detail.. And then there is yet another quiet farewell to the headphone jack. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro comes with an adapter though. There’s lots of talk about the change in audio tech but if you want my take on this, have a read here later.. The audio equipment in the cabinet is just as good as in the Mate 9: A loudspeaker radiates forwards, one downwards. In upright mode, the Duo switches to a two-way mono system. In landscape mode, it becomes a stereo setup. In any case, the output sounds rich and relatively good, which means considerably less tinplate than one would expect from smartphone speakers.. Photos taken with the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. The Mate 10 Pro uses Leica Sumilux optics. The software recognizes the person in the viewfinder and keeps them in focus. Focus mode eliminates aggressive post-effects on skin tones. The dynamic range of the Huawei Mate 10 Pro camera is outstanding. Without manual white balance, there would be nothing here. The selfie-cam now also recognizes faces and spares them the blur. In the camera app of the Mate 10 Pro you can watch the NPU at work. Object and landscape recognition is handled in real time via the new processor. In conjunction with the Portrait or Open Aperture modes, you can already see in the viewfinder what the image will look like after post-processing. And the results are also impressive. On the hardware side, there has been relatively little change compared to the camera setup from the Mate 9. These are now two f/1.6 optics of the Leica Summilux-H brand instead of the f/1.7 with Summarit-H. However, the asymmetric sensor duet remains: The black and white sensor resolves with 20 megapixels; the RGB sensor resolves only 12 megapixels, but has an optical image stabilizer. Each of the sensors has its own image signal processor, whose data merges from the artificial intelligence on the NPU to an image, analyzed in real time and processed in the viewfinder in real-time.. In the new Portrait mode, similar to the 2017 variants of the iPhone or Google Pixel, the AI recognizes the scene in real time and adjusts both exposure and post-processing accordingly: Exposure time, focus and saturation ensure that photos get an effective look even without manual post-processing. Green grass just gets a little greener. For this purpose, the NPU uses offline training data that Huawei had evaluated on its home servers from 100 million photos.. The camera understands whether you are photographing a pet, a person, plants or food and applies filters that are commonly used for photography of such objects. And especially for fast-moving objects, it is helpful that the focus of that movement follows consistently until you trigger.. Especially the Bokeh effect, which was implemented with great effort in the Mate 9, is now used more sparingly, intelligently and accurately. Portrait mode comes with the EMUI-8 update to the other Huawei smartphones.. After I was a little skeptical at the beginning about whether so much post-processing will benefit the photos, the results were a pleasant surprise. The Mate-10-Pro camera or its AI reliably detects what to focus on and colors, sharpens and revs up the dynamics where necessary. The results are always visibly retouched, but still cool.. Of course, you can also deactivate postprocessing. Even then, the camera achieves excellent results. This is due to the optical image stabilizer and last but not least to the new, large f/1.6 aperture, which together allow for smaller ISO values or shorter exposures, i. Finally, you can activate the manual mode already introduced in Huawei P9 by dragging the bar above the trigger button. There you manually adjust ISO, shutter speed, exposure compensation, focus, white balance or color temperature if you don't like the automatic settings.. Selfies are made with the f/2.0 fixed focus snapshot. Here, too, a focus effect is possible, which, unlike in older versions, also recognizes groups cleverly. Blurred faces are a thing of the past. Here you can also see how the portrait mode captures and sharpens all faces.. Extensive menus give you fine control over power-intensive apps. SuperCharge charges the Mate 10 Pro with over 20 watts.. battery power of the Huawei Mate 10 Pro is outstanding, as expected from. The problems with missing notifications about the battery life from previous Huawei smartphones also seem to be a thing of the past after a week of testing.. Instead, Huawei now gives you sophisticated, manual control over apps that run in the background. EMUI will not stop them without your permission. Particularly smart is the dark mode to save energy with the AMOLED display of the Mate 10 Pro.. The 4,000 mAh battery can be charged quickly with Huawei's proprietary technology lightning-fast; after 30 minutes the original accessory charges from 0 to 58 percent. However, wireless charging is not available. and the battery cannot be easily replaced.. Starting from 100 percent, I was able to use the Mate 10 Pro for a complete weekend from Friday evening to Monday morning. On another weekend I used it as a Wi-Fi hotspot and took some photos. Then the battery lasted only one day, but in this heavy user scenario it lasted longer than many competitors.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro technical specifications. 154.2 x 74.5 x 7.9 mm. 2160 x 1080 pixels (402 ppi). HSPA, LTE, NFC, Dual-SIM , Bluetooth 4.2. Huawei kann nicht überholen, ohne einzuholen. Despite its promising performance, impeccable design and top-of-the-range camera, Huawei still stands out in terms of price. The fact that it follows the trend towards more fragility in terms of design and removes the jack plug connection is unfortunately normal and sometimes necessary in view of the competition.. Huawei wants to be first in the race for the best smartphone and. the pro version of the Mate series is its strongest effort yet. An astonishing amount of hardware from the previous year is hidden inside. Huawei bets on his breakthrough with the new NPU, the little brain behind the Mate 10 Pro and the new camera effects.. And with the latter Huawei really knows how to impress. After a week I don't want to let go of this camera for a moment. There's hardly any other phone with which. get such a good result so quickly. Here, Huawei can stand up to the consistently more expensive competition.. In the weeks to come, we'll have the Huawei Mate 10 Pro head-to-head, then we'll find out how its battery life and the results of its camera with or without filters will cut off against the. iPhone 8, Pixel 2 or Galaxy Note 8 .. What do you think? Could the Mate 10 Pro be your smartphone of the year?. Just picked up a Mate 10 Pro after 2 years with a Samsung S6 Edge. No way I was having another Samsung with the amount of bloatware that comes preinstalled. I have to say I'm very impressed with the Huawei. No facebook, no twitter, no instagram or indeed any other social media software. What a refreshing idea to allow to only have the one(s) you use installed (or in my case none at all). As noted in the article the camera is superb. I have for years done wedding photography with a Nikon D3 and whilst in ultimate quality terms the D3 is under no threat the Mate 10 Pro gives good enough results that the D3 will rarely see the light of day for anything unpaid. Even hand held night photos come out clean and crisp and with minimal noise. It really is astonishingly good for a smartphone camera! Battery life as expected is superb and makes a refreshing change from finding a power socket every 7 or 8 hours and has a neat little touch in that it can be used as a power bank for other devices! IP67 isn't class leading (there are some IP68 phones) but its good enough for my purposes. I'm very impressed with this phone I must say.. I loved the Mate 9 but knew that I could not manage a phone which was nothing-proof (dust, water, air, sand, sun etc.)-I drop everything. This H.Mate 10 Pro is one of the most beautiful phones I've ever not been able to afford, and seems to have everything I'd want in a phablet. However, my heart skips a beat every time I read about the V30 , a really nice piece of equipment. I didn't want an iAnything and the Samsungs just weren't right for me. I bought the G6 in June and it's ok. It's my first Smartphone, I suppose it's a good $550 "starter" phone (I realize the price dropped 6 minutes after I purchased it). I was worn out from research and experimenting w/every Flagship phone produced between 2016-2017 and had to make a decision and couldn't wait for U11 to stop the dress rehearsals & make it's first appearance in the unlocked USA market. The Note 8 is a nice phone (finally).. Huawei gets major points on design with the Mate 10 Pro, but I feel they really missed the mark with such a low resolution at this price point. Western consumers are used to high resolution screens and this just won't cut it. They didn't do themselves any favors by cutting out the headphone jack either. Just a few changes and this phone could have gone toe to toe with the Note 8 and the V30, but it won't now.. Samsung learnt from there big mistake by not offering the micro sd card slot on there Galaxy S6 & Note 5 models,and there sales were not so good,so Huawei might have made the same mistake,and releasing these phones a little later in the year some people might wait to see what's on offer early 2018 before buying these new phones,no 3.5 headphone jack will also deter people purchasinget these phones,Samsung as started a super trend now with there S8 design. Its translated from the original article in German language.... My opinion: the mate 10 pro is a beautiful but in some way stupid product .... it has no MircoSD-Slot but only dualsim (that cannot be a big difference in production costs), no headset connector and a lower resolution than the Mate 10.... I doubt it will be a great success..... This article feels like a bad translation and I couldn't follow it in detail, but for sure there's at least one big error - the GPU in the Mate 10 (all variants) is a brand new, 12-core Mali 72. Huawei said it's 20% with a 50% power consumption reduction compared to the one used in the Mate 9.. MWC 2018 live updates: Sony shakes up the Xperia XZ2 design. * Please enter a valid email address.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Battery life, Call Quality and Conclusion. by John Velasco. AT&T - AT&T + Android - Android + Huawei - Huawei +. 4 Battery life, Call Quality and Conclusion. Boy has it been one busy fall season so far! All the major players in the smartphone space have announced their offerings for the upcoming holiday season, including Huawei , who is banking on the Mate 10 Pro to make a splash stateside. On paper, Huawei's high-end is looking like a solid contender, but it is surely going to face stiff competition from direct rivals in the space – the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 , LG V30 , Google Pixel 2 XL , and Apple iPhone X , to name a few. So let's find out how the Huawei Mate 10 Pro will fit into the mix. Design Ditching the line's previous formats, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro instead dons a totally new, fresh-looking design that holds its own amongst its peers. Gone is the all-metal construction of its predecessor, replaced by a now-trendy glass-meets-metal-trim design. Even though this approach has been done countless times by now, Huawei's interpretation is differentiated, mostly by the signature stripe running across the camera lenses – adding a hint of charm to an otherwise typical design. Much like its peers, it too follows in the same near bezel-less look with its screen , conjuring up a pretty good screen-to-body ratio of 80.97%. Adding to that is its subtly curved glass wrapping around the phone , which causes it to shimmer under the light at certain angles, but also makes it prone to being a fingerprint magnet. Bettering last year's construction, the Mate 10 Pro benefits from an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. That's wonderful news, of course, also marking a first in the line, so to that degree, we're happy that it compares to the competition. Even though we're happy to see that the fingerprint and IR sensors make a return, we're sad that the headphone jack had to be axed. As a consolation, Huawei does package in a USB Type-C to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter, as well as an Earpods-esque pair of USB-C headphones. We seriously love how this looks and feels in the hand! By now, however, this glass-meets-metal-trim design language is becoming the norm – and to some degree, tiresome as well. At the very least, it exudes a premium finish, features a water-resistant construction, and is differentiated by that stripe on the back. Display Squeezing in a 6-inch 2160 x 1080 FullView OLED display, its all-screen and minimal bezel appearance is also attributed to the 18:9 aspect ratio it's sporting. Again, this is another trend that's been big throughout the year, so it's no surprise to find Huawei following suit. And they should, obviously, given how it helps to cram in more screen into the body. All in all, there's very little to complain about. The display is more than detailed enough for our eyes, colors have an iridescent tone to them, and it manages to remain visible under direct sunlight. There's some distortion with the screen when tilting or viewing it at angles, usually giving it a colder (more bluish) tone, but it's not that distracting.. 6.07 x 2.93 x 0.31 inches. 154.2 x 74.5 x 7.9 mm. 6.24 x 3.07 x 0.3 inches. 158.4 x 78.1 x 7.5 mm. 6.4 x 2.94 x 0.34 inches. 162.5 x 74.8 x 8.6 mm. 5.97 x 2.97 x 0.29 inches. 151.7 x 75.4 x 7.39 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro Compare.

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Two photos of the Huawei Mate 10 Pro's OLED panel show that the phone can pump out deep blacks and also punchy, saturated colors. I stitched both photos side by side partly to show off its display panel range, but also because I don't want comic nerds to accuse me of. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro had. some pretty big shoes to fill. And I'm not saying that because the Chinese tech giant has made some lofty claims about the Mate 10's built-in A.I. capabilities via its NPU (neural processing unit), or that the Mate 10 Pro may be the first Huawei smartphone to finally have U.S. No, the Mate 10 Pro had high standards to meet for me personally because last year's Mate 9 Pro was my favorite smartphone of. I'll be honest -- at first glance the Mate 10 Pro disappointed me a bit. I absolutely loved about last's year device -- dual curved (Samsung style) Quad HD OLED display. the matte metal back that felt oh-so-premium in the hand -- are gone, replaced with a flat display panel that actually has lower resolution and that glass back that. The back of the phone is made of glass and curved at the sides.. The Mate 10 Pro is only 7.9mm thick.. the Mate 10 Pro definitely is masterfully crafted -- there are no seams between the glass back plate and metal side casing -- and has a beautiful slim bezeled,. almost edge-to-edge screen front, at this point of the year these features are expected rather than innovations. The Mate 10 Pro doesn't look inferior to the LG V30, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 --. and probably the iPhone X for that matter -- but it isn't necessarily superior either. Almost all flagship smartphones look really sleek and sexy now.. The Huawei Mate 10 (middle) next to the LG V30 (left) and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (right).. But then I began using the Mate 10 Pro as my daily driver, and all the little things that made me love the Mate 9 Pro. I absolutely adore Huawei's camera app, despite its overly-complicated layout, because it offers several clever trick photography modes that no other phone offers (I'll get more into this later); I love the pitch black notification shade and settings page on EMUI, Huawei's Android skin; and that fingerprint reader!. It feels silly gushing about well-established tech like a fingerprint sensor, but after using a phone with a terribly-placed scanner (Samsung's phones) for a few months, going back to a phone that unlocks 100% of the time immediately whenever I want it to is a godsend.. And then of course there's the Kirin 970 chipset, developed in-house by Huawei. Even last year, I called the Kirin 960 the most powerful chipset on any Android phone (beating the Exynos 8890 and Snapdragon 821), and this year Huawei. has likely widened the gap because the 970 is the world's first mobile chipset to have a dedicated NPU (Neural Processing Unit).. I've written about NPUs before from my reporting during IFA and initial hands-on with the Mate 10 , so I'm not going to spend too much time explaining here other than to say this: NPUs, which were designed with artificial intelligence in mind, are so much more powerful than the traditional GPUs and CPUs found on computing devices that Facebook and Google are actively working on.. So although the Mate 10 Pro's looks didn't give me that initial "whoa" feeling I got from devices such as the Galaxy S8, Xiaomi Mi Mix, or even last year's Mate 9 Pro, it is a device that has grown on me because it's so refined, so polished.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro's 6-inch OLED display is beautiful, but at 2160 x 1080, is lower resolution than the Mate 9 Pro's Quad HD resolution.. Let's start with the software: the Mate 10 Pro is one of the first non Pixel devices to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo, and though it's covered by Huwaei's own EMUI, Google's new features are all readily available -- this includes Picture-in-picture, notification icons, and ability to snooze notifications.. Huawei has made a big effort in cleaning up its EMUI in recent years and this year's version (8.0) is the company's leanest and most intuitive yet. Other than the square-ish, iOS-like icons (which I don't like), EMUI doesn't really get in the way of Android the way many other Chinese Android skins do, instead bringing additions on the side that users can choose to accept or ignore. The Mate 10 Pro is the first Huawei phone I've used that doesn't break my push notifications. I've written about this before , but Chinese smartphones (from Xiaomi to Vivo to Huawei to Gionee) all have such heavy battery optimization software that they either delay or stop push notifications, which is a big pain in the butt for me and, well, anyone who uses the phone for productivity. The problem is fixable, but requires a long list of settings tweaks. With the Mate 10 Pro, everything just worked out of the box, no tweaking needed.. That last sentence about the phone just working is probably the theme of this review, because the Mate 10 Pro's NPU with onboard A.I. shows a lot of potential to help you get things done without making adjustments. As I mentioned in the hands-on,. the Mate 10 Pro's cameras know exactly what it's looking at, and it'll show off by displaying an icon in real time to signify the scene. Even after opening the camera app some hundreds of times now during my testing period, I am still amazed that the phone's camera knows when I'm pointing it at a dog, a cat, a plate of food, a street sign, or whether the scene is a sunset or mid-afternoon.. The Mate 10 Pro's camera can identify text from a dog, a cat from a person, a flower from a tree.. Since the camera knows what it's about to shoot, it adjusts settings accordingly. And for the most part, this works as advertised. I found myself consistently able to grab a good shot with the Mate 10 Pro from just point and shoot, without needing to tap on the subject to focus or adjust lighting. Check out the below images shot with the Mate 10 Pro and Galaxy Note 8.. Shot with the Mate 10 Pro.. Shot with the Galaxy Note 8.. Samsung's shot is technically brighter, but details appear washed out, with noticeable grain. The Mate 10 Pro captured its shot without any tweaking on my part -- a cleaner, less noisy shot that still captured the lighting.. Below is another image snapped with the Mate 10 Pro. Again, I didn't need to adjust the lighting to capture the purple-ish sky, the camera just did it.. Shot with the Huawei Mate 10 Pro.. Of course, this "machine adjusted setting" thing doesn't always produce superior shots. Huawei's engineers told me the camera will automatically punch up contrast and saturation for food shots to make the dish more appealing, and my review unit of the device definitely does just that ... image of the hot dog captured. with the Mate 10 Pro is overly saturated and sharpened (especially the ketchup) to the point of looking cartoonish. taken by the LG V30 on the right may be more muted, but it's a lot more natural and realistic shot of food.. Mate 10 Pro (left); LG V30 (right).. For animal shots, the camera knows to focus on the fine details of the creature.. Shot with the Mate 10 Pro.. Check out the details around the bird's eye.. Another sample with the Mate 10 Pro.. Next page: more camera talk, performance, battery life, etc....

This entry was posted in Mobile Review and tagged high-end-phone , huawei , mobile .. Huawei Mate 10 Pro: Outstanding still image performance. Posted on October 20, 2017 February 14, 2018 by Paul Carroll. Dual-cam with 12Mp RGB and 20Mp monochrome sensors. Dual f/1.6 lenses with Leica optics. Conclusion: Dual-camera in a different (but excellent) way. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro is an outstanding smartphone for photography enthusiasts.. Featuring a dual-camera setup developed in cooperation with Leica, which combines a 12Mp. with a 20Mp monochrome sensor, it achieves an overall DxOMark Mobile score of 97 points. This ranks the Mate 10 Pro as the currently second-best. device we have tested, just a single point behind the Google. About DxOMark Mobile tests : For scoring and analysis in our smartphone camera reviews, DxOMark engineers capture and evaluate over 1500 test images and more than 2 hours of video in both controlled lab environments and in natural indoor and outdoor scenes.. This article is designed to highlight the most important results of the testing. For more information about the DxOMark Mobile test protocol,. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro excels for still photography, where it achieves a phenomenal Photo sub-score of 100 points, matching the currently highest Photo sub-score of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Its key strengths are good exposures, particularly in indoor conditions; a very good wide aperture mode, which produces a mild, but attractive bokeh effect with few artifacts ; and outstanding autofocus performance. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro is a very capable performer in video mode, too, achieving a video sub-score of 91 points. Video autofocus is fast and accurate, with good tracking capabilities and generally low levels of noise .. Shooting outdoors, or in bright light conditions, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro generally delivers good target exposure, even in tricky high-contrast scenes, where both shadow and highlight detail are well-preserved. Occasional exposure instabilities are sometimes noticeable, however, especially on consecutive pictures in challenging light, with some underexposure evident.. The Mate 10 Pro delivers generally excellent exposures in bright light, with a warm but pleasant white balance .. White balance is generally accurate and very consistent across multiple frames. A slight warm color cast is visible in outdoor pictures, but remains pleasant, and some photographers will appreciate the warmer tones. Occasional failures in color rendering can result in over- saturation for specific colors, however — particularly reds, which display a slight tint bias turning them a little pink in some outdoor shots. Texture and detail are excellent on static scenes in bright light, and although lower levels of detail are recorded in scenes that include subject motion, they remain very acceptable.. Exposures in both indoor and very low-light conditions are excellent, with very usable exposures at 20, 10, 5 and 1 Lux. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro also displays a wide dynamic range in indoor pictures, with our backlit window portrait displaying nice detail for both the darker portrait subject and in the brighter areas in the background.. In our challenging backlit portrait scene, the Mate 10 Pro ensured a good exposure in both the darker and brighter regions for a well-balanced final result.. Texture remains very acceptable on static scenes shot under indoor lighting conditions, and it’s only in very low-light conditions where the loss of fine detail becomes more significant. Scenes with motion are a little more challenging for the Mate 10 Pro,. so if you’re after super-sharp shots that include movement, try to shoot in good light. White balance is again accurate and repeatable in low light, with that slightly warm but pleasant color cast evident. Color rendering, particularly in indoor lighting conditions, is very strong, and although a little less saturated in extreme low light, it remains very acceptable.. Exposures are particularly good indoors, with nice brightness, well saturated color and good levels of detail — especially in static scenes.. Overall flash results on the Mate 10 pro are excellent, producing nice exposures with accurate white balance and color rendering, as well as good detail preservation. The flash output is well-centered in the frame , with good frame coverage ensuring acceptable lighting in the corners. Using flash in very low-light conditions, some luminance noise is visible in the shadow regions, but overall white balance, color rendering, and detail preservation remain good.. The Mate 10 Pro’s dual-tone LED flash module provides good frame coverage, pleasant exposures, and nice color in both flash-only and mixed lighting shots.. When zooming, the Huawei Mate 10 uses the high 20Mp resolution of its secondary monochrome sensor and computational imaging to capture a high-quality digital zoom image. With a 2x zoom factor, detail preservation is not quite as good as on devices using optical zoom, such as the Apple iPhone 8 Plus and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, but it’s not far off and is noticeably better than the single-lens Google Pixel camera. Loss of detail becomes more evident when you push the zoom slider beyond the 2x setting, though. You’ll also find noisy edges and some ringing in zoom photos.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro, 2x zoom. Apple iPhone 8 Plus, 2x Zoom. With its Wide Aperture mode enabled, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro is capable of creating a bokeh effect with accurate depth estimation and good subject isolation that is even a touch better than the iPhone 8 Plus’s Portrait mode. Wide Aperture also detects other objects in the focal plane in addition to the main subject, and delivers repeatable and stable results. There are some artifacts visible under closer inspection, though, and some images taken in bright light show a degree of underexposure.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro Wide Aperture mode.. Apple iPhone 8 Plus Portrait mode.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro’s video footage shows good exposure, low levels of noise, pleasant colors, and accurate white balance in all light conditions. The autofocus works fast and accurately, with good tracking, and the video stabilization efficiently counters camera motion.. On the downside, texture levels are quite low in all light conditions: under tungsten lighting, footage shows a noticeable orange cast, and there is some visible highlight clipping in high-contrast scenes. Some slight low-frequency residual motion is still visible despite the video stabilization.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro achieves a total photo score of 100, which is calculated from its scores in tests that examine different aspects of its performance under different lighting conditions. In this section we’ll take a closer look at these image quality sub-scores.. An excellent overall exposure score of 88 is comprised of a low light score (83), indoor score (93) and outdoor score (89).. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro achieves good exposure scores at all light levels.. The device really excels in indoor lighting conditions, with excellent exposure on our tricky backlit portrait and good target exposures in low light conditions down to 5 lux. In extreme low light of just 1 Lux (effectively candlelight) exposures remain very good with useable results.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro produces usable exposures even in extreme low light conditions of just 1 Lux.. In outdoor conditions we had lots of success on high dynamic range scenes, with good detail preservation on the shadows and highlights in many shots. It’s not quite as effective as the Google Pixel or iPhone 8 for HDR exposures, but remains very capable in lots of situations.. Points were lost for some exposure irregularities however, including some exposure inconsistency over consecutive frames, as well as some under-exposed shots, mainly occurring on backlit high contrast scenes, when shooting towards the light.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro – HDR exposure. Another very good overall score for color of 86, with excellent color rendering indoors (92) and outdoors (87), as well as very acceptable results in extreme low light (80). The Huawei Mate 10 Pro’s main strength for color are consistent and repeatable white balance in all conditions, as well as good color uniformity in both indoor and outdoor conditions.. Although white balance is consistent and repeatable, a slight warm color cast is evident on both indoor and outdoor pictures, but whether you consider this a benefit or drawback will depend on personal preference. Points were also lost for occasional color irregularities, which were particularly noticeable in the red hues, with a slight tint bias often rendering over-saturated reds that shifted towards pink.. An outstanding overall score for autofocus, which is fast and accurate in all lighting conditions. For both static scenes and scenes with subject movement, performance is phenomenal in both indoor and outdoor lighting conditions, achieving the top mark of 100 in these cases. In very low light, slightly lower scores of 99 for static scenes and 94 for scenes with movement were achieved, which are still amazing results for such conditions. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro’s autofocus also shoots with almost zero shutter lag, consistently recording in focus shots over 30 consecutive frames, defocusing between shots.. Autofocus irregularity and speed in low light (20 Lux): Over 30 consecutive frames and while defocusing between shots the Huawei Mate Pro 10 found focus very quickly with almost zero shutter lag and consistently delivered in focus images on every exposure.. The Mate 10 Pro achieves a good, if not amazing, score for texture, with the best results on static scenes in both indoor and outdoor lighting conditions. In lower light conditions between 1 to 20 lux less fine detail is preserved on static scenes, but with acutance ( sharpness ) above 50% at 1 lux, rising to 80% at 20 lux, the device is capable of great fine detail preservation on static scenes. Evaluating scenes with subject movement, the greatest detail is preserved in very bright conditions outdoors. Results indoors remain very acceptable too, but expect a noticeable loss of detail in very low light images (below 20 lux) on scenes with subject movement.. Texture score per lighting condition and motion in the scene. On handheld images, using the DxOMark test chart in the lab, you can see that in very bright light (1000 lux), exceptional sharpness is achieved on static scenes and even in lower light conditions of 20 and 10 lux detail preservation remains very good.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro, 1000 Lux,. Huawei Mate 10 Pro, 20 Lux, crop. Huawei Mate 10 Pro, 10 Lux, crop. A good score for noise with the best results achieved in bright light conditions. Luminance noise is very slightly visible in 100% crops in areas of uniform color such as the sky in outdoor conditions, but it’s only really visible at close inspection and doesn’t detract from the overall image. Under indoor lighting conditions, luminance noise is more visible but it’s reasonably well controlled under indoor lighting between 100 to 20 lux, with significant deterioration of image quality only becoming evident in extreme low light between 1 and 5 lux.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro, 100 Lux, crop. Huawei Mate 10 Pro, 20 Lux,. Huawei Mate 10 Pro, 5 Lux,. A fairly low, but acceptable score of 66 for artefacts. The most serious issue is the blocking effect, which is regularly visible in areas of uniform color, particularly the sky. Flare is also sometimes visible, but usually only when shooting directly into the light on tricky high contrast scenes. A cyan shift , close to over saturation, was also observed in many outdoor scenes affecting the blue color of the sky.. In areas in uniform color, notably the clear blue sky, a blocking artefact is evident .. In a magnified view, you can clearly see the blocking artefact, which appears as lighter blocks of color.. A very good score for flash, with consistently good results on both flash only and using flash in mixed lighting conditions. The main strengths of flash pictures are accurate exposures, accurate and repeatable white balance and well controlled artefacts, although a visible red eye effect is sometimes visible on flash only portraits. Some corner shading occurs, resulting in a build up of noise in the shadow areas, but it’s far from the worse we’ve seen and the flash is well-centred in the frame.. Despite the absence of a second. telephoto lens the Huawei Mate 10 Pro achieves a very respectable score for zoom. At 2x zoom the lossless zoom effect applied using the 20Mp monochrome sensor achieves results almost as good as devices featuring a second telephoto lens, such as the iPhone 8 Plus, in very bright light conditions, where good detail is maintained. It’s not quite as good at 2x in lower light conditions, with the loss of fine detail evident at 100 lux and a significant loss of detail in very low light of 20 lux and below.. In very bright conditions of 1000 lux, 4x zoom shots are just about acceptable, but in lower light or in any lighting conditions at 8x the loss of detail and visible luminance noise significantly impact image quality. You can see from the images below at 8x zoom the iPhone 8 Plus’s telephoto lens does a better job of maintaining fine detail on mid range zoom shots, with fewer artifacts such as ringing visible.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro, 8x zoom. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro ’ s Wide Aperture mode does a very respectable job of blurring the background in both indoor and outdoor conditions. Its key strength is its shallow depth of field , which has an attractive blur. The blur is not as aggressive as we ’ ve seen on some other devices however, and the classic circular highlights that you ’ d expect to see with an optical bokeh effect are not rendered. The effect is very repeatable however, with consistent results achieved across consecutive frames, and very few artefacts are visible around the foreground subject, resulting in a pleasing final portrait.. The Mate Pro 10’s bokeh simulation mode delivers a subtle but very attractive background blur affect with minimal artefacts visible around the portrait.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro is a very capable device for video, although with a slightly lower video sub score of 81 overall, it’s not quite as strong here as it is with stills. Category scores for video include Exposure (81), Color (85), Autofcous (89), Texture (48), Noise (77), Artefacts (87) and Stabilization (86). Its stand out performance is for video is autofocus, where, like with stills, it is fast and accurate, with good tracking capabilities in all lighting conditions.. Color rendering is also very good, with pleasant colors and accurate white balance in all conditions. Although that slight warm color cast we saw with stills persists on video under tungsten lighting, it’s not unattractive, and a slight cyan shift is visible in skies shooting video outdoors. Target exposures are generally accurate, with the best exposures achieved in bright light conditions, although dynamic range is a little limited shooting high contrast scenes. In indoor conditions, video exposures remain good and fairly acceptable in extreme low light, if a little under exposed, but noise is well controlled on low light videos, which is a bonus. For stabilization, good motion reduction is applied on both indoor and outdoor videos, with a slight residual motion.. With its RGB/monochrome dual-camera concept, Huawei is following a different concept than most other manufacturers, but the Mate 10 Pro’s class-leading still image results show that the Chinese manufacturer is on the right path, and that good zoom and bokeh results can be achieved without a longer focal length on the secondary camera. The Mate 10 Pro is no slouch in video mode, either. It’s not quite on the same outstanding level as for stills, but is nonetheless capable of delivering a very solid video performance all around.. Good detail preservation, even in low light, and low levels of noise. Good target exposure and wide dynamic range. Good detail preservation in 2x zoom shots. Good bokeh simulation with nice subject isolation. Fast and accurate autofocus with good tracking. Good motion reduction in all lighting conditions. Pleasant colors and accurate white balance in all lighting conditions. Occasional exposure instabilities in consecutive shots. Blocking artifacts sometimes visible in the sky. Occasional hue shift close to saturation. Slightly low texture detail in all lighting conditions. Slight lack of dynamic range in high-contrast scenes. Visible orange color cast under tungsten light sources. Sony FE 16-35mm f/2.8 GM lens review: Highest-rated wide-angle zoom. DxOMark Image Labs launches Chinese-language version of dxomark.com. They did not pay enough i guess. marques brownlee said they wont do it =/. LG V30 has a lot of problems.. video stabilisation so good? OMG… what protocol is this? there are plenty of videos available on YouTube showing the device was so shaky when shooting video….. DXO lost it’s credibility when the score of Mate 10’s video stabilization is higher than Note 8.. Have you ever considered that the video stabilization might be turned off in those clips? (sine you must manually turn it on in video settings).. I believe that youtubers turned off eis. That’s why the stabilization is bad. With eis it might be better. sry but i look on almost every video with mate 10 pro, and its true that on most of video there is no OIS turned on. It’s pretty obvious stabilization was off for those videos, I have seen clips with it on and stabilization is excellent.. LMAO, most funny post dxo ever post. 1) In the camera specifications you mentioned “20160@30fps (4k)” which clearly got added a “0” by accident from “2160@30fps (4k)”. 2) In the first test “Bright Light” you mentioned the device as “Huawei P10 Pro”.. look like the photo over expose…ok..it’s my screen problem ….look ok in phone tho... Shooting outdoors, or in bright light conditions, the. “Huawei P10” Pro generally delivers good target exposure, even on tricky. high contrast scenes, where both shadow and highlight detail are well. Occasional exposure instabilities are sometimes noticeable. however, especially on consecutive pictures in challenging light, with. As I understand the Mate 10 has the exact same camera modul as Mate 10 “Pro” – can anyone confirm that?. In many way the Mate 10 is a better mobile than the Mate Pro – In fact the one without “pro” mentioned in its name, should be the “pro” – as we know: A real pro does not sport it J. the cameras are same in Pro and standard module. They having different lens – F/1.6 lens. Not according to specs from Huaweis own home site:. Since when dxomark is a website dedicated to jokes? oh I remember, “WE CHANGED THE WAY WE BENCHMARK THE CAMERAS”, REALLY? HOW? gg wp dxojokebiasedmark. Exactly, it’s honestly a joke the Pixel XL2 can have the lead by one point over this setup.. Does it even support OIS for 4K@60fps? Previous Huawei flagships supported OIS up to 1080p@30fps but not for 1080p@60fps or 4K@30fps.. Which video resolution/fps was used for these tests? I would assume the highest (or not?) which would mean OIS support for 4K@30fps. What about 1080p@60fps? Is OIS supported? In the early YouTube reviews I’ve seen OIS for 1080p@30fps only, not for 4K@30fps. For 1080p@60fps I haven’t seen any review yet.. This is the best camera of the year, 100 for photography tieing the Note 8 beating the Pixel XL2 and overall score of 97 just one point behind the Pixel XL2. Kudos to Huawei they’re absolutely killing it.. How did you made the decision ???? If all scores are below 97, how can the sum total to be equal to 100 ????. A- Add phone model number to the review. Variants of the same phone can have different chipsets, RAM and even sensors made by different manufacturers. All factors can affect camera performance. Samsung Galaxy S8 line is an example where certain markets get different chipsets. B- Clearly mention the software build number used during testing. Over time a manufacturer could improve performance or add new features through software updates.example: Image stabilization during video recording was greatly improved with a software update for the OnePlus 3T.. Not really I’ve seen comparable.pictures with Sony Experia XZ phone and it is not that good.. LOL you must be kidding the XZ’s and all Sony phone cameras suck.. Not saying that Sony was better ,but some pictures were. After all that blabbing about how Huawei will kill Iphone I feel disappointed. Especially how Huawei differentiated Mate 10 and Mate 10 pro .. This review is too short comparing to Google Pixel or Samsung Note 8, no many convincing approves, why?. It clearly says in the article “Please note that we have produced this review in a concise format. We will add more detailed information on test results and additional sample images very soon.” Read it again.. Guys this is a terrible review. No comparison photos, no justification for any scores. This should be like 3x longer…. It clearly says in the article, “Please note that we have produced this review in a concise format. We will add more detailed information on test results and additional sample images very soon.” Read it again.. Please note that we have produced this review in a concise format. We will add more detailed information on test results and additional sample images very soon.. Estos se estan forrando vendiendo notas. This looks a lot like an “ad” paid by Huawei. To be honest all the pictures seems to be terribly worse than iPhone 8 Plus or Google Pixel 2 XL.. The Mate 10 [2x zoom picture] is better than the Pixel 2 and even the iPhone 8 Plus.. Look at the reflection of the clouds in the window.. Only a few photos and no any color charts or comparison.. What’s wrong with DxO? Have You Been Hacked??. It clearly says in the article, “Please note that we have produced this review in a concise format. We will add more detailed information on test results and additional sample images very soon.”. What’s wrong with your sight? Need your eyes checked?. I think you must be a big fan or staff of HW... Please note that we have produced this review in a concise format. We will add more detailed information on test results and additional sample images very soon.. “Please note that we have produced this review in a concise format. We will add more detailed information on test results and additional sample images very soon. I think many people who explain the article is too short to get the conclusion must overlook this.. I saw few camera comparisons between Note 8 and mate 10. Note 8 was noticeably better in almost all aspects, especially video, stabilization is way superior on note. All agreed both are fine and all gave advantage to note 8. Yea sure you watched that Mr.whotheboss rookie comparison and since you own a Note 8, you magically agree with that conclusion.. rookie comparison? Oooh and DXO is correct giving those points right?. DXOMARK is the reference for image quality.. Yes, that was one of 3. And no, I own htc 10.. just saw that video and came here.. Mrwhosetheboss( Arun Maini) is the worst reviewer !!!. People get too tied into these numbers man. The Note 8 has a fantastic camera… as does the iPhone 8 Plus, as does the Mate 10…. BUT, Is the Note 8’s camera worth carrying around a phone with the dimensions of a TV Remote in your pocket? Nah.. I have the Note 8 and I actually don’t mind the size. I actually like the large screen and the S-pen is useful for my work. However, I am disappointed with the camera on the Note 8 because my work requires a camera that can capture good detail and although the Note 8 takes great colorful photos for social media, it is not that great when you need a camera that allow you to zoom in to study details. Once you compare “uncompressed” photos that allow you to zoom in, the Note 8 is quite disappointing.. Sounds like some buyer’s remorse for the Galaxy TV Remote.. No camera could sway me to rock that thing. Note series is the best android can offer. Too much probably for many users and too expensive, but no phone bests and beats it.. That statement hasn’t been true since the Note 4. Huawei (aka Hawaii) now wears that crown. If you own an Android phone and its not a Huawei (Mate) you’re doing it wrong.. Well, the only dangerous fanboyism is Googles. Fanboyism is always dangerous and it doesn’t make sense why you would pledge your soul to a massive corporation like Google, Apple, Intel, Samsung, etc.. When you take a step back and ask who has been making innovations to their hardware and SW, Samsung is never the answer anymore. Which sucks, bc my Note 2 3 and 4 were fantastic. Huawei has some stellar hw, and their android skin lets you do things that used to only be possible with Root (like literally forcing individual apps to stop running when the screen is off).. Have fun with your TouchWiz lag that Sammy still hasn’t figured out all these years later lol. No, Huawei fanboyism is innocent, irrational and unfounded. Google fanboys are dangerous, it is the leader and Android owner that is trying to act like Apple, forcing users in their direction, deciding what is good or bad, killing diversity and features, limiting other android manufacturers, selling poor featured phones with deliberately inferior parts (common with Huawei) and pricing their IKEA phones abnormally. I own the best phone for me, and it’s not made by Google, Samsung or Huawei. But my favourite company is on the way I don’t approve and we will probably separate. Non of the “fabulous” 2017 flagships even tempted me to replace it. A little bit V30, but glass back is hard to swallow. And tricky amoled screen…first gen screen can’t be really good. Anything first gen can hardly be good. Samsung is the emperor of amoled. Now we have Mate 10 Pro that, screen aside, Is better under every single aspect.. Actually Mate 10 was noticeably better in almost all aspects of the cameras, front and back.. Ahahaha omfg, please tell us more 😀 😀. Pixel 2 is better than Note 8. Note 8 pictures are oversharpened and oversaturated.. Pixel 2 is only better in daylight and medium low light, in real low light it gets destroyed by the Note 8, open your eyes.. DXO are extracting the urine, why say just the Mate 10 Pro when all the Mate 10 handsets have the same friggin camera setup. i need to see the V30. The V30 =LG G6= Bad camera. NO LG V30 IMX 351, G6 IMX 258, V30 f/1.6 and f/1.9, G6 f/1.8 and f/2.4. V30 on YT destroy iP8 Plus Note 8, Pixel 2…. I don’t think that’s a real video. The LG V30 doesn’t even have a bokeh mode, and the video shows some pictures with bokeh.. I was expecting V20 or now V30 …. After i saw that LG put tiny sensors in both G6/V30 i don’t bother any longer. G6 already struggles in mid light conditions so V30 will suffer 100% the same. f1.6 and crystal instead of plastic, will help but not that much in order to convince someone to buy it for the camera…. For real ? Same sensors ? =/ I. Not exactly the same between G6/V30, but both equal or less to 1/3” sensors. Physics cannot be beaten only with software or small f. I truly hope LG proves me wrong…. Google paid them JUST enough to allow the Pixel 2 to remain king. I’m a huge fan of Huawei’s dual cam setup on my Mate 9, but the Pixel cam and Google’s HDR+ are really quite incredible.. The Mate 10 Pro is excellent and sometimes better than the Pixel 2.. Phones tested here are supplied by manufacturer or DXOMark get it themselves? Just want to know if the phones manufacturer are the ones wanted their phones to be tested by an independent and have the results posted here or its DXOMark that randomly pick the phones from market to test without the manufacturer consent.. Probably are supplied by the manufacturer, if you think about Pixel 2 it was tested before the presentation. Then I don’t know if this works with all the phones. Commenting in a phone’s canera after seeing the dxo score is wrong, firstly its process of giving an overall score us still not understood and brands pay dxo mark well to give them higher score, some even to get the first place…that’s why we see under rated phones….so dxo score doesn’t tell everything about the camera and shouldn’t be taken seriously…. Which is why the Note 8 scored so high. Being an owner of the Note 8, I am very disappointed in the camera. It was no improvement over the Note 7 that I had. Even my Huawei made Nexus 6P using the NX camera app took better pics than the Note 8.. Dear Shubham, please be sure that all devices we test are treated with the same protocol. The DxOMark scoring system is a result of a robust method which can be accurately repeated. Please find more about our new DxOMark Mobile test protocol here:. whoever pays the most gets featured first. I love to see Samsung fanboys triggered by having their Note8 surclassed under every aspect by a Huawei. Cpu, memory Speed, signal strenght with a dual sim dual active 4g cat18 module, battery, camera…. Oh wait the Note 8 got a nice screen at least (till it doesnt start going pink like with my s7 Edge). Memory speed wasn’t overtaken, it’s just worse. claiming to be faster than a11 and 835 yet it doesn’t even come close. From the comparison, the average benchmark scores of the Mate 10 is on par if not slightly better than the Note 8. But nothing can compare with the Apple’s A11. The A11 is light years ahead of the competition despite all the arguments I’ve heard from all the Samsung fanboys.. Dude I think you need a pair of glasses. By the way I was talking about internal memory writing speed, that reached 170mb/s of random write.. do you mean Huawei used eMMC flash memory could surpass Samsung UFS.1, stupid idiot.. I think your marvellous mom used eMMc on you, more than Huawei on its Phone.. I think your Fxxking mom has damaged your brain. HUAWEI P10 is using both eMMC 5.1 and UFS 2.1 as flash storage, https://forum.xda-developers.com/p10/how-to/huawei-p10-using-emmc-5-1-ufs-2-1-flash-t3591355. Huawei has been using UFS since 2016. HUAWEI P10 is using both eMMC 5.1 and UFS 2.1 as flash storage. This is not impressive… I just don’t see great picture quality.. don’t attack people who have different opinions.. WTF? This is better than both the Note8 and iP8? It actually looks not better. also, They haven’t even tested the LG V30 yet.. why you bother other’s people opinion, your act is like a disgusting mosquito. It looks like a fake test, no comparisons, no justification for any score. This preview report upload before huawei launch in China, so Huawei can add DxOmark score as an endorsement. It sounds like an “Ad” paid by Huawei, DxOmark lose its credibility and independence. Both Apple and Google did the same thing.. sryy bro but i totally disagree with your words becozz i am using huawei mobiles and camera performance is awesome but they are lacking in video stabilization. We have created DxOMark scoring system with one goal : develop and implement a robust test protocols which can be accurately repeated time after time. Be sure that all devices we test are treated exactly in a similar way. Please look at this article about our new DxOMark Mobile test protocol here:. In my opinion, I will pick iPhone 8plus and Samsung Note8 because both have optical zoom which is way better Huawei Mate10 digital zoom, and Google Pixel 2 has none. if I am favor in video recording, I will pick iPhone 8 plus because it can record 4K video up to 60fps, and I will pick Samsung Note8 because its still image quality is superb. your rating system is so complicated and not transparent. This can only confuse and mislead consumers.. It’s obvious DxOMark values photography fundamentals more than anything else so just apply some critical thinking and choose the phone with the camera that has the features you use the most and stop being salty about the phone you like having a lower score than one you don’t.. Here’s a cheat sheet since you’re too lazy to read reviews:. The Note 8 has better detail preservation than almost all sensors with the best zoom so you should choose it for that, the Iphone 8+ is a jack of all trades, master of none type of camera which means it can do everything well but it isn’t the best at any of their parameters, the Pixel 2 has the best fundamentals (color/contrast/exposure/texture) coupled with the best autofocus but because it’s so aggressive on processing it does have a lot of noise creeping in compared to all the other top cameras. The Mate 10 Pro has the second best fundamentals (color/contrast/exposure/texture) but makes up for it by having significantly less noise and artifacting than the Pixel 2. It’s autofocus is also the second best and due to having less processing it creates a soft natural bokeh even when you’re not using boken mode just by tapping on a subject to focus. It’s biggest weakness is perhaps video stabilization which is worse than both the Iphone 8+ and the Pixel 2.. I won’t justify Huawei’s superiority in performance or camera because they release the phone late in market. Late? What do you mean? Are the shops all closing down, or what? Phones are supposed to be getting released all year through, just like movies. There is always a premiere in every month of the year.. btw, you could also argue that the others were late cuz the huawei p10 was released in april.. i am currently using honor 8pro whose camera performance is way better than one plus 5 becozz i have experianced both mobiles with my own hand. One plus 5 has 87 DxOMark score, and Honor V8 pro is like Huawei Mate 9 only 85, do you mean DxOMark has made a big mistake or just a Joke.. Mate 9 indeed is preferable over iphone 7plus. So i think it is more of a personal choice. The only annoying thing in Chinese smartphone camera is selfie zombie effect 😁. I been waiting to see the Mate 10 result from you guys. Will Pixel 2 get update review after they turn on the extra chipset for photo?. Also, possible to run a test on Essential Ph1? People say they have been updating the camera, but I wonder how well it is along with the main stream.. This report seems incomplete, I think they can add the low light noise and dynamic range later. So far the photos look average, even the portrait mode the 8plus looks much more natural. This Leica 21mm f1.4 look still nicer on the real deal.. How DxOMark Mobile scores smartphone cameras.

Limited market availability (some markets will get the Mate 10 instead). Instead of marching in lockstep, the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro will be chasing each other from one place to the next, quite unlikely to catch up except in a select few regions. It's not a parade then, it's a pursuit and therefore more exciting. So, which one would you pick ? The super-sharp Mate 10 or the have-it-all-but-not-quite Mate 10 Pro? The former had its primetime slot already, it's now the Pro's turn to take the spotlight.. The Mate 10 Pro is quite different from the regular model, coming with a 6" 18:9 AMOLED screen with even slimmer bezels, a water-tight body, faster LTE, more RAM and storage and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. The upgrades come at a bitter price though, costing the Mate 10 Pro the QuadHD screen resolution, the audio jack and the memory card slot.. The new Kirin 970 with the hyped Neural-Network Processing Unit (NPU) is shared among the two to hopefully set the standard in machine-learning-driven hardware acceleration on Android. The cool Leica Dual Camera is a top performer with a high-res monochrome sensor, manual mode and smart scene recognition. There's also the fast-chargeable 4,000mAh battery, which at this point is almost a given on a Mate device.. Although we appreciate the upgrades, getting rid of the microSD and 3.5mm jack is at odds with the very definition of a Pro device. The screen resolution is a downgrade that, in fairness, hurts the Mate 10 Pro's reputation more than anything else. In fact it might help extend the battery life even further so it's not entirely bad.. In spite of the strange decision-making that saw the Mate 10 series features split between the pair, the 10 Pro is still among the most impressive smartphones Huawei has released - if not the one. Technically, it's not even the company's first water-proof phone and the dual camera upgrade is mild at best. Maybe it's the way it looks - sharp yet delicate, elegant and powerful. The Pro seems ready to act as the de facto flagship and certainly looks the part. Is it best-seller material though? Let's find out!. Retail package, 360-degree spin, design 3.

Huawei Mate 10 Pro review: A feature-packed flagship with extra AI. | October 26, 2017 -- 10:01 GMT (18:01 GMT+08:00). 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. Kirin 970 chip's AI features boost usability. No 3.5mm headset jack (USB-C headset and 3.5mm adapter provided). yes Conclusions Essential Phone review: Lovely titanium and ceramic with potential for greatness The Essential Phone was a tough sell at $699, but at $499 it is compelling. It offers flagship specs with lots of potential, but there is some risk in a startup launching its first phone. LG V30 review: Stunning hardware optimized for media creators and audio lovers The V30 is easily the best phone ever made by LG with the large minimal bezel display, high quality dual rear cameras, Quad DAC audio support, microSD card, drop/water/dust resistant construction, and attractive design. Google Pixel 2 XL review: It doesn't get any more Google than this The Pixel 2 XL has an improved camera, new design, and new software tricks. Flagship smartphones: Specs, benchmarks and prices for iPhone, Samsung, Huawei and more Updated to include Huawei Mate 10 and Google Pixel 2 specs, and iPhone 8 benchmarks. Here's how the top end of the smartphone market looks at the moment.. Huawei has established a trend of releasing standard and 'pro' versions of its flagship Mate handsets, and the latest models continue that trend. In fact, there are three versions of the Huawei Mate 10. Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro , there's an even more expensive Porsche Design version too.. I was sent the large-format (6-inch) Mate 10 Pro to review. It's bursting with top-end features, including. Android 8 (Oreo) , the Kirin 970 processor with integrated AI (which affects many aspects of the phone, including photography and energy efficiency), a Leica-branded dual-lens rear camera and dual 4G LTE SIM support.. The Kirin 970-powered Mate 10 Pro comes in Midnight Blue, Titanium Gray and Mocha Brown, with a Pink Gold version also available in China. It has a 6-inch minimal-bezel OLED screen and weighs 178g.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro is a large handset, although given its 6-inch screen it's not oversized. That's because of the almost absent bezel on the handset's long edges and minimal top and bottom bezels. Huawei calls this arrangement FullView -- well, every edge-to-edge screen design needs a name. Notwithstanding the small bezels, don't expect to squeeze this 74.5mm by 154.2mm by 7.9mm handset into every pocket, and do expect to notice its 178g weight.. One ramification of the small bottom bezel is that the fingerprint sensor sits on the back of the handset. I found this comfortable to use -- indeed, on a large phone it's much easier to get at one-handed than a sensor that's beneath the screen.. There is a range of things you can do with the fingerprint sensor regardless of whether it's used for login. Without registering a fingerprint you can make both tap and glide gestures to answer a call, take a photo, browse photos and more. If you want to use fingerprint login, I found it fast and reliable.. I was sent a Mocha Brown review sample which looks distinctive and rather smart. Other options are Midnight Blue and Titanium Gray (and, if you're in China, Pink Gold). In each case the edges are made from aluminium and the backplate is reflective and slippery glass. It's not really to my taste, and it's not the most grippy of materials. It's also more vulnerable to smashes onto pavements or drops down stairs than an all-metal chassis would be.. The handset comes with a clear plastic shell that offers more grip than the glass, but adds bulk and weight and changed the bronzed brown colour of my handset to a more grey-like colour.. IP67 certification for dust and water ingress. This keeps up with the flagship smartphone market, but seems to have come at the expense of a 3.5mm headphone jack. Huawei provides a USB-C headset and a USB-C-to-3.5mm jack adapter, otherwise you can go wireless. The Mate 10, incidentally, has a headphone jack, but lacks an IP rating.. The 6-inch screen has an 18:9 aspect ratio. That's relatively rare on handsets, although the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 are two top-end models that share it. The resolution of 1,080 by 2,160 pixels doesn't break any new ground, but the resulting 402ppi pixel density is perfectly good enough for everyday use.. This aspect ratio can leave a significant black strip to the left and right of wide-screen YouTube streams, although I stopped noticing these after a while. It also results in a taller-than-usual portrait mode screen, which might please those who do a lot of web browsing or ebook reading.. You can manually adjust the OLED screen's colour temperature, and select Eye Comfort mode for minimal blue light.. I'm certainly sold on the taller screen, but not so enamoured of the knuckle gesture that's needed to create a split screen for viewing two apps at once. The idea is sound, but I found it a bit hit and miss. Maybe I just need more practice. One thing I'm certainly glad to see is the ability to connect a larger screen via USB-C to HDMI. If nothing else, this will be useful for on-the-go presentations.. The OLED panel is beautifully bright and clear. HDR10 , a specification for HDR content that's increasingly popular on handsets (and other devices) and which helps ensure that visuals get close to what the creator intended.. In addition, Huawei provides a couple of familiar utilities that allow you to tweak the screen. Eye Comfort mode reduces blue light, which is great for those late-night reading sessions. This can be set to switch on and off automatically at set times. You can also manually fiddle with the colour temperature, and play with preset colour modes, toggling between 'normal' and 'vivid' -- with the latter really popping colours out.. The 6-inch Mate 10 Pro is a large handset, which some may struggle to navigate one-handed.. There's no room for Android shortcut buttons beneath the screen. Having the buttons in the screen is hardly a novelty, of course. In this case, a quick sweep up from the slim bezel onto the display causes them to occupy a narrow strip. They're difficult to use one-handed, though: the sheer size of this handset, along with its slippery backplate, meant I was always wary of dropping it when accessing the buttons. Consequently, this is a two-handed operation for me.. Huawei has a stab at fixing this by letting users place a 'floating dock' anywhere they like on-screen. This is effectively a large white spot that can be parked at the most convenient location for thumb access, and which can be used to navigate through apps or get quickly back to the home screen. I found this quite comfortable to work with.. The SIM caddy on the left edge of the chassis will accommodate two 4G SIMs -- a world first, according to Huawei. There's no MicroSD card slot on the Mate 10 Pro (although the Mate 10 does have one, as an option in the second SIM slot), but you get 128GB of internal storage. Out of the box my review handset reported 108GB free. A year ago I might have said this is enough storage for anybody, but these days I'm not so sure. And with 128GB MicroSD cards available for as little as £50, boosting handset memory significantly is not a huge expense. So, on balance, I'd prefer to see a card slot here.. The Kirin 970 processor is backed up by 6GB of RAM. Huawei is hailing the its new SoC as the first AI processor for smartphones, complete with a Neural Network Processing Unit (NPU) and there are features throughout the phone that use its capabilities, from the battery to the cameras. Huawei even says the AI in the CPU can help improve call quality by boosting low volume calls and invoking ambient noise cancellation when calls are made in loud environments.. Meanwhile, with Microsoft Translator preinstalled, the handset can perform instant translation in more than 50 languages by bringing the NPU into play. I had success with some foreign language websites, so this bodes well for future use.. Huawei says that the Mate 10 Pro is ready for upcoming AI-based apps that will be more responsive and intuitive. Time will tell how developers respond.. The Leica-branded rear camera system comprises 20MP mono and 12MP colour sensors, both with f/1.6 lenses.. Performance and battery life also get a helping hand from the NPU. The handset can learn your favourite apps and automatically allocate more system resources to them. There's no suggested life for the 4,000mAh battery, but my anecdotal evidence thus far suggests it should easily last through a working day -- it hasn't failed me thus far on that front, and might even go for two days. The provided cable supports Huawei SuperCharge, and half an hour's charging can deliver almost 60 percent battery charge.. The camera benefits from AI too. The main rear camera system comprises Leica-branded 20-megapixel monochrome and 12-megapixel RGB sensors, both with f/1.6 lenses. The front camera is an 8MP f/2.0 unit.. The rear cameras can identify some objects, and make automated adjustments to setting for better-quality shots. This 'scenario identification' worked well, spotting food, text, plants and my cat with ease. If you don't like what the AI does, a sweep up from the 'shoot' button invokes Pro mode, where manual settings can be made. There are plenty of shooting modes accessible by sweeping left.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro runs on Android 8 (Oreo) with a new Huawei overlay -- EMUI 8.0. The previous iteration of EMUI was version 5, but Huawei perhaps feels it carries more clout to tally with Android's versioning.. If need be, you can shrink the screen to make one-handed operation easier.. There is a lot going on with EMUI, some of which I've already mentioned, and anyone looking for a vanilla or near-vanilla approach to Android should look elsewhere. As well as masses of themes there are plenty of usability tweaks. For example, you can sweep left or right along the button bar when it's visible to shrink the screen either to the left or right to make one-handed use easier, and similarly shift the keyboard left or right to help reach across it one-handed.. This is a separately passworded section of storage where you can keep 'secret' files behind a second security wall. Finally, with a USB-C-to-HDMI adapter, you can plug the Mate 10 Pro into a monitor and get a desktop-like experience -- either by also attaching a keyboard and mouse, or by navigating the EMUI Desktop using the phone's screen as a touchpad. Samsung offers similar functionality with its Galaxy S8, but requires you to buy the optional DeX dock.. I mentioned at the outset that there are three versions of the Huawei Mate 10. This review looks at the 6-inch Mate 10 Pro, but there's also the 5.9-inch Mate 10 and a 'luxury' Porsche Design model. Here are some key points of difference:. 5.9 inches, 16:9 aspect ratio, 2,560 x 1,440 pixels, 499ppi. 6.0 inches, 18:9 aspect ratio, 2,160 x 1,080 pixels, 402ppi. 6.0 inches, 18:9 aspect ratio, 2,160 x 1,080 pixels, 402ppi. Huawei's flagship Mate 10 Pro is bursting with features. A great screen, very good battery life and widespread use of AI make it a pleasure to use, while IP67 protection is welcome. Internal storage capacity of 128GB sounds like plenty, but I'd still appreciate a MicroSD slot. The slippery glass backplate reduces confidence in one-handed operation, and the lack of a dedicated headset jack will irritate some, even though Huawei provides a USB-C headset and an adapter..

Like most Android phones, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro has two mail apps: Gmail and Huawei’s Mail app. While most people just add accounts to the Gmail app, it may be worth giving Huawei’s mail app a look because it takes advantage of the Mate 10 Pro’s 18:9 aspect ratio.

Huawei already surpassed Apple earlier this year to become the second-largest overall smartphone maker (behind Samsung), but it hasn’t yet had a hit handset to rival the iPhone 7 or the Galaxy S8. With the launch of the Mate 10, Huawei is hoping to change that.. While the new phones look a lot like the flagships from Google, Samsung, and LG, there’s a key difference with the Mate 10: Huawei says it’s smarter than the average smartphone. Thanks to a new chip with a built-in neural processing unit (NPU), the Mate 10 can sense, analyze, and adapt to its surroundings, letting your phone work faster and last longer.. The Mate 10 Pro has an edge-to-edge screen with thin top and bottom bezels.. G’day, Mate! Huawei may be the second-largest phone maker in the world, but it has yet to break into the all-important U.S. Last year’s Mate 9 with Amazon Alexa didn’t quite do the trick, but the smarts built into the Mate 10 could make the phone a hit with U.S. Huawei already makes world-class processors with its Kirin chips, and the Kirin 970’s NPU brings something new to the game. In a sea of shrinking bezels and top-notch cameras, it could be a difference-maker.. Like last year, there are two versions of the new Mate phone, a regular model and a Pro model. With the Mate 9, the Pro had a home button, a smaller screen, and Quad HD resolution, but this year it’s the non-Pro model that has all those things: Along with a home button/fingerprint sensor on the front, the Mate 10 has a 5.9-inch Quad HD 2560x1440 LCD display, while its higher-end brother sports a 6-inch Full HD 2160x1080 AMOLED screen with a rear fingerprint sensor. If you can’t tell from the resolution, that’s a 16:9 for the Mate 10 and an 18:9 ratio for the Mate 10 Pro.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro ditches the home button for. The screen isn’t the only difference between the two models. Both base models of the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro come with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but only the Pro model has an option with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Additionally, the Mate 10 Pro brings IP67 water resistance, but no headphone jack while the regular Mate 10 has a 3.5mm jack but you can’t get it wet.. Otherwise, the two phones are very much the same. Most importantly, they both have the homegrown Kirin 970 processor, which Huawei says delivers 20 percent power efficiency over the previous processor. And that’s with the same 4,000mAh battery in both models, so the Mate 10s should easily power you through a full day of heavy use. However, even though both phones have glass backs, neither supports wireless charging.. The Mate 10 has a dual-camera setup with dual f/1.6 aperture, but you won’t be able to take your eyes off the stripe.. Built into the Kirin 970 processor is a dedicated neural processing unit. Similar to the embedded neural engine in Apple’s A11 Bionic chip, the Mate 10’s NPU will aid with machine learning and artificial intelligence. Thankfully, Huawei hasn’t introduced a new digital assistant like Samsung and HTC did. Instead, the smarts built into the Mate 10 are used to make the phone faster (up to 25 times) and more power efficient (up to 50 times) than relying exclusively on the CPU.. Around the back, the phones feature dual-camera setups packing a 20MP mono camera with a 12MP RGB one. Both lens have an impressive f/1.6 aperture, while the main camera has optical image stabilization. The NPU comes into play here with automatic image detection, which dynamicaly switches shooting modes depending on what you’re shooting.. The selfie cam is a relatively pedestrian 8MP with a f/2.0 aperture, but it makes up for its specs by using AI smarts to quickly focus when taking group shots.. The Mate 10 will be one of the first Android phones based on Oreo, and to mark the occasion, Huawei has jumped its EMUI skin to version 8 (from EMUI 5 on the Mate 9). The new OS’s main feature is a floating navigation dock that puts a virtual home button on the screen that can be moved anywhere, which is particularly useful on the home-button-less Mate 10 Pro. Another feature is one-tap split screen, which lets you run two apps side by side without needing to drag windows around.. There’s a home button on the Mate 10.. Huawei also wants the Mate 10 to be a smart desktop companion. Just like the Galaxy S8 and Note 8 phones, you can hook up the the Mate 10 to a monitor to get a full desktop experience—except you don’t need to buy a dock to do it. Just plug a standard USB-C-to-HDMI or USB-C-to-USB-C cable from your phone to your monitor, and you’ll be able to use your Mate 10 like a mini computer, complete with multitasking, resizable windows, and Bluetooth mouse and keyboard support. You can even use your phone for other work while a video is playing on the large screen.. The Mate 10 will be available in brown, gold, pink gold, and black, while the Mate 10 Pro comes in blue, titanium gray, pink gold, and brown. There will also be a Porsche Edition that’s essentially a stylized Mate 10 Pro in a black case with a 256 GB drive and a vertical strip across the back. The Mate 10 will cost 699 euros and will be available in late October while the Mate 10 Pro will cost 799 euros and release in mid-November. pricing and availability have yet to be announced..

Dec 04 AT 4:13 PM. Dima Aryeh is a Russian obsessed with all things car and tech. His time is split between gaming and fixing his racecar. He also does photography in his spare time. Tagged # flagship # Huawei # Huawei Mate 10 # Huawei Mate 10 Pro # Kirin 970 # popular # review # smartphone. Huawei’s latest foray into the flagship market is the Mate 10 Pro. which, along with its brother the Mate 10 ,. bring a much needed update to their predecessors. Featuring an all-new glass construction and the return of Leica-branded cameras, they’re set to compete with the more established flagships in the US.. First, let’s talk about the color of this phone. It’s called Mocha Brown and is a real shock to see in person. While most phones are either black, white, or gold, Mocha Brown stands out as this deep, versatile color. In some lights its plain light brown. Sometimes it glows a dim pink. It’s absolutely stunning and is a pleasure to look at.. The front is a solid sheet of glass with no buttons; only an earpiece, a camera, sensors, a dim notification light, and a Huawei log interrupt the bezels. I wish the logo wasn’t there, but Huawei loves to slap logos everywhere.. Under the glass is a 6-inch OLED display. Where the standard Mate 10 opts for a standard LCD at a higher 2560×1440 resolution, the Mate 10 Pro rocks an 18:9 2160×1080 screen. This means that the pixel density is lower, but you gain the inky blacks and vibrant colors we know and love from OLED. The display also features HDR10 support. There is a pre-applied screen protector out of the box, but unlike previous Huawei phones, there is a quality oleophobic coating underneath. Don’t be afraid to remove that screen protector.. The screen is gorgeous, and being OLED, has deep blacks and saturated colors. The colors are fairly accurate but of course a bit blown out, which I love. It has a color accuracy mode but it’s a tad washed out and warm. Outdoors the display gets very bright and is easy to see. There is no color change at an angle until you’re almost at a 90-degree angle to the phone. Despite the lower resolution, it’s a gorgeous display and one befitting of a flagship.. With OLED displays comes the worry of screen burn-in ( especially after the Pixel 2 XL debacle ). Now most displays shouldn’t show burn-in within the course of a week, so the Pixel was an odd case. The good news is that the Mate 10 Pro doesn’t exhibit any burn-in, even with a black status bar and navigation bar over the course of a few weeks.. Despite the “FullView” name, this is far from a bezel-free display. The top and bottom bezels are very small, but they’re bezels nonetheless. The side bezels are also quite a bit chunkier than the ones on the Essential Phone , though they’re still small enough to be almost inconsequential. Nonetheless, it’s awesome to see that a taller and larger 6-inch display fits into a device that’s smaller than last year’s 5.9-inch Mate 9 .. The back of the Mate 10 Pro features more glass and more logos. The curved glass has a set of dual Leica cameras embedded in it. The cameras protrude and have a metal ring around them, keeping the lenses recessed. Flanking the cameras are the dual LED flashes and laser autofocus along with a Leica logo and some text about the lenses. Below that is a fingerprint sensor, the same. fast and accurate one Huawei has used in other devices. And of course below that is another Huawei logo.. Despite being dual SIM, the Mate 10 Pro does not feature the hybrid dual SIM/microSD tray. Instead it just takes two SIM cards. Unlike the Mate 10, the Pro does not have a microSD slot at all. The 128GB of storage should make up for that though.. At the bottom you won’t find a headphone jack (its Mate 10 brother retains one), but you will find a USB Type-C 3.1 port. Not only is it Type-C, but the addition of the 3.1-spec port adds some cool features.. The speaker on the bottom gets pretty loud, and despite being tinny, is pretty good for a smartphone. Huawei has made it so the earpiece can double as a “stereo” speaker, or it can produce the highs like a tweeter. It actually greatly improves the sound in portrait mode, though in landscape the stereo effect isn’t great.. In the box you’ll find your standard Huawei speedy charger (with a full-size USB port), a Type-C to 3.5mm adapter, some Type-C headphones, and a case. The headphone adapter has a built in DAC (this is not an analog adapter) and it’s pretty decent. It sounds about the same as the audio coming from most phones and can drive higher-end headphones to reasonable levels. The headphones are okay but an appreciated inclusion. The case on the other hand is actually pretty fantastic. It’s a clear TPU case with a matte look and a clear window for that rear stripe.. Huawei spared no expense to build the Mate 10 Pro (and its brother the Mate 10, which is built almost identically).. The glass front and rear feel very premium, although it can be argued that there is no point in a glass phone that doesn’t require glass for wireless charging. Nonetheless, the glass feels amazing in the hand, if a bit slippery.. The metal frame is perfectly machined and has no sharp spots or places where it doesn’t meld with the glass panels imperfectly. There isn’t enough gap to catch dust like the Honor 8 used to. amazingly solid and clicky, with the power button being rough for quick differentiation from the volume buttons.. All the small details make this phone feel brilliant in the hand. Whether it’s the smooth frame or the perfectly clicky buttons, it’s a joy to hold.. With the Mate 10 Pro debuts EMUI 8.0. A few versions have been skipped to bring EMUI up to the same number as the Android version. And yes, it launches with Oreo!. While there are plenty improvements that have been made in EMUI 8.0, it feels every familiar to anyone who has used the previous version of Huawei’s custom software. Everything is where it usually is and everything looks the same. It’s not a light skin, but it’s not all that heavy either. Many functions are very similar to AOSP. The status bar is now the size of the AOSP one and the smaller, more tightly. grouped buttons of the Mate 9 are missed.. Huawei added a ton of software features to this phone. Huawei Histen effects for headphones are pretty neat, though audio lovers will turn them off most of the time. Stereo+ uses the earpiece as a second speaker which creates a decent effect. You can use the fingerprint reader to answer calls, take photos, browse photos, and more. You can also create an entire double of your software, missing most info like account info and photos, using a different fingerprint than your usual one. This is definitely an awesome feature, though your text messages remain.. The navigation dock is an alternative to the nav bar we know and love. The nav bar can be hidden with a tap of the small arrow, exposing the full 18:9 screen for media. The navigation dock is a small floating dot that goes back when pressed, home when long pressed, and shows recent tasks when long pressed and swiped sideways. It can also be moved around just by dragging it around. It sounds annoying, but it’s actually quite nice. It can be put right by your thumb on the right side midway down the display. It’s better than stretching your thumb to the bottom of this tall display. You do lose the ability to turn on Google Assistant with a long press, but you can use your voice for that.. Otherwise, you’ll find many of the features that people love in Oreo. The new notification system is mostly implemented, picture-in-picture works great, Autofill is present, long pressing icons for shortcuts is built into the Huawei launcher, and the new Oreo emojis rear their ugly faces.. Unfortunately, Huawei omitted the Trusted Voice feature that allows you to say “OK Google” when the display is off. You can wake the device with a custom phrase and HiVoice, but the functionality is severely limited to the point of being nearly useless.. You also won’t find the AOSP always-on display. Instead it’s replaced with Huawei’s own version, which shows a clock and battery full time. Unfortunately, notifications from non-Huawei apps won’t appear here. It’s not worth the battery life hit.. An amazing feature Huawei added to the Mate 10 Pro is a PC mode. Much like Samsung DeX (but without the overpriced dock), you can turn. your phone into a fairly functional PC using nothing but a DisplayPort-supported USB Type-C to HDMI adapter. Plug it in and you’ll get multiple modes. You can mirror your phone’s display or go into a desktop mode.. With the display mirrored, you’ll be able to use your phone on the screen. The only difference is that your notifications will not show up on screen, giving you security during presentations. In full desktop mode, you can access notifications in the corner and open multiple supported apps in windows like on your computer. It’s an amazing addition and can be done with a $12 adapter.. I’ve noticed few bugs, but there have been a couple persistent ones. One doesn’t allow you to press the first button below notifications half of the time. Not being able to delete Gmail emails is an annoyance. Another is that Google Maps animations are stuttery, despite scrolling around a map being smooth. An update has been promised for this. Any other bugs have been extremely minor.. The Kirin 970 processor is a boss and matches the performance of Snapdragon 835-equipped devices in every way. It’s fluid, fast, and stutters are few and far between. The large amount of RAM also means things stay running in the background without hurting performance.. With 128GB of storage out of the box, you can load it up with tons of apps. This can become a problem as a lot of stuff runs in the background, but performance never really takes a hit. And if the Mate 10 Pro is anything like previous Huawei devices, it’ll keep running fast and smooth for a lot longer than the average Android device.. Another key element of performance is the NPU, or neural processing unit. Huawei claims that it learns over time to keep some apps running in the foreground for faster load times as well as other improvements. All this happens in the background, but it adds a lot of potential to the device.. An app comes pre-loaded to take advantage of this NPU. The app is Microsoft’s translator, and while it can’t do live translations, the photos you take are translated nearly instantly. More apps can take advantage of this processor so we may see more useful features come to the device.. features a dual camera Leica setup. The 12MP color sensor is matched with a 20MP monochrome sensor that is more sensitive to light, meaning it can capture more detail in the dark. The main sensor is outfitted with optical image stabilization and both sensors are fitted with f/1.6 lenses for that sweet natural depth of field.. The photos taken from this device are generally absolutely stunning. The colors are beautiful, the details are sharp, the dynamic range is stellar, and noise is nowhere to be seen even in darkness. Frankly, many of its photos almost look like they came from a larger, much more expensive standalone camera. The depth of field without any software enhancements is particularly pretty. And in the dark, the photos are often brighter than reality. The device occasionally oversharpens photos, giving them an unnatural look, but this doesn’t happen often. Nonetheless, there is a bit more sharpening going on with the Mate 10 Pro than other devices.. When it comes to software additions, you have many choices. The device features tons of modes like monochrome, HDR, panorama, 3D panorama, night shot, light painting, time lapse, slow mo, document scan, and more. The functionality of these modes definitely varies. The monochrome uses the monochrome sensor to take ridiculously stunning black and white images. A monochrome sensor definitely beats a black and white filter. The HDR mode is mostly useless, inconsistently offering either more or less dynamic range than auto mode. Night shot takes photos with up to 30-second exposures for beautiful night photos with large dynamic range, but a tripod is required for this. The 3D panorama is an odd feature but pretty neat to play with.. There are also a few features accenting the auto mode. The classic wide aperture mode uses the depth data from the dual sensors to simulate a wider aperture, giving a mostly very natural depth of field effect that often outclasses the competition. There’s also a portrait mode that combines a beauty mode with the wide aperture effect as well as a moving picture mode, which records a bit of video before and after the photo is taken.. A big highlight of the NPU and Huawei’s AI tech is the ability for the camera to recognize different scenes instantly. Whether it’s the sky, a sunset, nighttime, snow, pets, plants, or food, the camera software will change the settings on the fly and show a little icon to tell you that it recognizes the scene. This works great for bringing the scene’s proper details out. Plant mode boosts the greens, sky mode boosts the blues, sunset mode makes sunsets look fantastic, and snow mode lowers contrast to preserve details in the snow. It’s instant and requires no user input but makes for some amazing photos. It can’t be turned off though, so there’s no comparing to photos without the feature.. In 12MP resolution mode, the software offers a 2X digital zoom. While there is naturally a loss of quality, it’s nothing close to what you would expect from most other phones. 2X zoom photos come out pretty good, with only a small hit in detail. Thanks to the 20MP sensor, this crop won’t cost you much quality. There is no 2X zoom in 20MP mode.. Huawei also provides a fully functional manual mode. You can change every setting including focus as well as enable RAW file saving. This manual mode is a fantastic addition, but with all the software wizardry Huawei does in auto mode, it’s unlikely you’ll get a better photo in manual. Nonetheless, it’s great to have in some situations.. I had a short chance to compare it to the Galaxy Note 8 in low light detail, and it actually did significantly better.. The video quality is pretty decent but nothing to really write home about. The 1080p60 video is nice and smooth while 4K30 has tons of detail. It’s unfortunate that there is no 4K60 option to compete with the iPhone 8. Electronic image stabilization is also not available in 1080p60 and 4K30. Generally I’ve used 1080p60 for that higher framerate.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro Photo Samples. This phone packs a beefy 4,000mAh battery, which is rare in smartphones these days. However, battery life is often up to software more than hardware. Some of our favorite battery marathon devices have smaller battery sizes.. With that big battery and Huawei’s generally solid software, you can get two days out of this phone with regular use. My daily goal was to stay over 50%, and I managed it almost every day. Only very heavy use managed to drain the battery below 20% by midnight. Even better is that I keep my display excessively bright.. Often times I can make it two days with 7+ hours of screen on time, many email and social media account syncing, and lots of music streaming.. Huawei Mate 10 Pro 9.5 / 10. Huawei’s latest flagship definitely doesn’t disappoint. With a beautiful display, blazing fast performance, an absolutely amazing camera, and top notch build quality, it hangs with the big boys. With specs being at the level they are today, experience matters most these days.. We wish Huawei would go easier on the software layer (there’s something to be said for the experience of AOSP), and the screen could be a bit higher resolution. But overall, the Mate 10 Pro is an incredible flagship and a great choice among the more popular devices in the US. We just hope it launches here soon!. - Any - 3G|4G U301 USB Modem Acer Aspire One Netbook Acer Liquid M220 Airave 2.5 Plus Alcatel 510A Alcatel 768 Alcatel 871A GoPhone Alcatel A392G Alcatel Fling

Huawei Mate 10 Pro Reviews - page 2. Huawei Mate 10 Pro is rated. Rated 5 out of. I bought this phone on the 12th February 2018, and I'm writing this review 3 days into owning it.. Now, I will say I was sceptical about buying this phone... Mainly due to the screen resolution only being full HD and the phone I did want was the Samsung s8+ which is known for the amazing screen.. Let me just clear the water here.. The mate 10 pro has a Stunning screen, not only is it big, its colourful and I really can't tell its lesser resolution from my last 2k screen LG G4. In fact, the screen on the mate 10 pro is more contrasting because its AMOLED.. As a photographer of over 10 years I can safely say the 2 sensors on this phone have really impressed me. Photos are crisp and you have a large selection of modes..low light photography is great, especially great for me as I need to photograph products inside, out of direct sunlight.. The phone is really REALLY fast, the fingerprint sensor scans and unlocks the phone in what feels like 0.2 seconds, maybe even faster. Going from app to app is smooth and I have litereally been getting more stuff done for work with the almost seamless experience.. Phenomenal, I've yet to run out of battery and this was something of a daily occurrence with my LG G4.. Lastly but not of less importance is the feel and look of the phone.. It's weighty, solid and the materials it's made of just strike me to be of premium quality. The almost bezeless design leave you feeling like this is more of a screen than a phone, and that's a good thing because it's beautiful.. If I have to be very very picky, the only cons to this phone are.. The volume buttons on the side feel very slightly loose and the led notification light is dim compared to that of my G4. But despite having a higher resolution screen on paper, I will NOT even consider using my G4 again. The mate 10 pro is hands down the single best phone I have ever used in my life.. Not only am I completely happy with my purchase, the photos and speed of the phone is greatly improving my productivity and as a result my business is already seeing an increase in custom.. Want my opinion, just take the dive! You won't regret it. The very fact that I have taken time out of my day to do this lengthy review is proof of how impressed I am. Rated 5 out of. Even though Huawei is new on the market, it proved to be able to compete against well established phone. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro has a beautiful device and a superb camera. I love the big battery, which allows me to use it the whole day.. Rated 5 out of. Such an incredible phone, super fast thanks to its incredible procesor and 6gb ram. Beautiful display and great colours thanks to its OLED technology. The battery is the best ive ever come accross but the most amazing feature is its camera look at this photo I took.. Rated 5 out of. I bought this phone yesterday so have not got too much experience but the first impressions are. Good looking and good quality for sure.. Despite the 6 inch screen very comfortable to hold and operate. I looked the S8+ and did not seem proportional and handy. (I know that is a 6.2 inch one). I do like the look of Mate 10 pro better than any other phones. I searched a new phone for 3 month and put very details on the scale before I decided to buy this handset. The battery, the Oreo 8, size f the screen, th camera, and finally the price. £699 with £100 cash back and £ 40 Amazon gift card.. Huawei has got a service which let you clone your old phone to the new one. 10 minutes and you have every apps, photos, messages, contacts on the mate 10 pro. Go for it, you wont be disappointed.

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. the iPhone X's OLED display with a bezel-less design looks great,. but by November 2017 it's not anything unique.. Put the iPhone X side by side with the LG V30 (which I did plenty) and it's not even clear Apple's device is more cutting-edge looking. This is not meant to be a knock -- I'm merely saying there are plenty of stunning looking devices on the market already. The iPhone X doesn't look inferior to any of them, but I don't think it's necessarily superior either. I mean, look at the photo below with my iPhone X next to the LG V30 and Huawei Mate 10 Pro. It works in the dark, even when I have glasses or a hat on. It's also very, very fast for a face scanner ... but still ultimately slower than using a fingerprint unlock (a well-located one anyway, not Samsung's absurd version). less than half a second, which doesn't sound like much ... but then we unlock our phones hundreds of times a day. The "swipe up from the bottom to exit and app and go home" gesture is very well implemented, and paired with the iPhone X's higher-than-other-phones 120Hz touch input rate, the result is a super smooth, pleasing animation that sees the app glide away along with my thumb. I personally prefer Android over iOS, but it's little things like this that makes iOS special, and why Apple fans are so devoted.. From left: The Samsung Galaxy Note 8, the iPhone X, the LG V30 and the Huawei Mate 10 Pro.. I've been using my iPhone X for almost a day now, and even though many, many reviewers have given their take already, here are some quick thoughts before I dive into my usual camera comparisons.. From left: the Huawei Mate 10 Pro; iPhone X; LG V30. The iPhone X's camera bump is noticeably more pronounced than the other three phones.. So without further ado, let's move on to the tests. I pitted the iPhone X against the Huawei Mate 10 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and the LG V30, almost inarguably three of the four best Android shooters right now (Pixel 2 is probably at the top of the list ... but I haven't had a chance to test that phone yet). I took all photos in point-and-shoot situations, without trying to adjust lighting and all that. All photos are unfortunately shrunk down on this website, but I'll put a link at the end to check out full resolution samples if you want a further look.. Let's start with a general day shot, of the. Bing Thom's Xiqu Centre right across from my apartment.. And here's the same iPhone X shot zoomed in to 100% and cropped.. Next up is the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. Same set-up: a normal shot, then a zoomed in crop.. Shot with Huawei Mate 10 Pro.. Moving on to the Galaxy Note 8.. Last but not least, the LG V30.. In the full shot, the iPhone X, LG V30 and Note 8 all produced well-balanced, detailed shots. The Mate 10 Pro surprisingly under-performed, notice how dark the cars and road below look. But zooming in, we can see that LG and Apple's shots turned out the best, as Samsung's shot is filled with grain.. But you know what, any phone can capture a good shot in direct sunlight. Let's hit the streets at night.. All four shooters captured a great low light photo, but zooming in on my monitor, LG's f/1.6 aperture comes into play, as the shot is just a bit more dynamic with superior details. The iPhone X's 12-megapixel, f/1.8 shot didn't fare so well when zoomed in on the sign above the tram stop.. Let's look at another set of night shots:. The LG V30 suffers from a usual LG camera problem -- overexposure. Otherwise, the other three images look great, and comes down matter of preference. I think I'd go with either Huawei's or Apple's shot.. Here are some more iPhone X photo samples:. Video recording on the iPhone X seems very good too. The iPhone X's camera is overall excellent as expected, but in terms of general photos of scenery and buildings and. cats and stuff, it isn't necessarily better than, again, the three big Android phones on me right now. In fact, Huawei's Mate 10 Pro beats the iPhone X in. But where the iPhone X shines is shooting photos of people, particularly portraits.. Over the years I’ve grown used to Samsung and Huawei approacing selfies and portraits like a photo editor at a fashion magazine -- meaning the blemishes on my skin and bags under my eyes get wiped away, and I end up looking like a plastic surgery’ed out wanna-be K-Popper. Apple’s portrait mode offers something the opposite direction, a “studio” lighting that turns selfies and portraits shot with the main lens into gritty headshots.. My girlfriend and I, shot with iPhone X's portrait mode in studio lighting set-up.. Check out the photo above, of two portraits stitched together. Sure, the iPhone X's lighting showed my bad, acne scarred skin and eye wrinkles in full, but I think it's a shot with character. I usually dislike selfies, but even I'm digging it. I mean, compare this to the plasticky look that Chinese phones turn me into.... I'm on the left, if you can't tell.. That's it for now with this iPhone X first look. I'll be back with a full review and more tests.. I've started a YouTube channel in an effort to provide multi-media coverage of gadgets I come across. If you're interested, please subscribe..

Excellent battery and capable camera give serious competition. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro is a phone with which it's hard to find significant faults and easy to discover bits that you like, and you probably couldn't ask for a lot more in a phone than that.. Outstanding performance, excellent low-light camera performance, speedy fingerprint scanner, beefy battery.. Huawei's EMUI won't appeal to all, the handset is incredibly slippy.. HUAWEI'S MATE 10 is the most recent flagship big-screen handset from the Chinese manufacturer, and it goes up against the regular contenders in the form of Samsung's Galaxy S8+ and Note 8 and Apple's iPhone 8 , as well as cheaper rivals like the OnePlus 5T.. With Samsung planning an earlier than usual launch of its next flagship S series device , is the Huawei Mate 10 Pro worth splurging on just a couple of short just weeks ahead of the next crop of releases at MWC 2018?. On paper at least, the Mate 10 Pro demands some attention - touting some top-end specs, and a wealth of additions to the core Android OS, and with a retail price of £699, it's not the most expensive phone at the high-end of the market, either.. Design and hardware Huawei's been refining the finish of both its hardware and software in recent years, and the result for the Mate 10 Pro is a flagship that feels almost as premium as devices like the similarly sized Samsung Galaxy S8+, albeit without the same curved edge design. It's worth noting to avoid any accidents that the regular Mate 10 isn't waterproof, but the Mate 10 Pro is.. Like its high-end rivals, the phone is a combination of a metal chassis with a glass rear panel, and the finished product is an impressive package - but not one for anyone that hates fingerprints all over the front and back of their phone.. To the right side of the 6in (2160x1080, 402ppi) OLED display is the power button and volume rocker, while the left side of the chassis houses only the combined microSD and SIM slot. At the bottom of the phone is the USB-C port, and there's no 3.5mm headphone socket in sight, so you'll need to use the included adapter if you want to use wired headphones.. Notably, on the rear of the phone, the Leica-branded main camera has a 20MP monochrome sensor and a 12MP RGB sensor that combine to form higher resolution images. You also get a dual-LED flash and optical image stabilisation on the camera too.. Sitting beneath the camera arrangement is the zippy fingerprint sensor that unlocks the phone in almost no time at all - you're not left waiting around to see if your print has been registered.. Returning to the front of the device, the selfie camera is a more regular affair, comprised of an f/2.0 wide-angle lens and 8MP sensor.. Powering everything along is Huawei's own Kirin 970. octa-core CPU with i7 co-processor, and a Mali-G72 MP12 GPU. RAM is either 4GB or 6GB, depending on which model you have - we've reviewed the 6GB RAM model with 128GB storage.. You also get a "neural network processing unit", which is essentially Huawei's response to artificial intelligence-based processing units in some other Android and iPhone handsets. It's harder to say specifically when this processor is being used, but it kicks into life for things like object identification when you're taking photos and predicting which apps you might need to use next, as well as on-the-fly language translations.. Similarly, depending on where you're buying your Mate 10 Pro, there are a few different colours to choose between - Midnight Blue, Titanium Grey, or Mocha Brown. In the UK, only the 128GB version is being sold so far.. Software, EMUI 8 Running beneath Huawei's Emotion UI is Google Android Oreo (8.0), and while the most recent version of Android is still very much there, there are a few changes worth calling out.. Aside from minor appearance tweaks, the most notable EMUI 8.0 features are the AI-based integrations in some of Huawei's own apps that draw on that neural processor. For example, the camera makes use of it for object identification and the photo gallery app uses a smart loading mechanism that detects when you're quickly scrolling past photos looking for a specific one so that you don't need to wait for all the thumbnails to load.. The Navigation Dock is another EMUI 8 feature that you'll either love or never use. In short, it places a virtual joystick-like button on your screen that functions as the traditional home, back and recent buttons found at the bottom of most Android handsets. You still have the option of using the regular virtual buttons at the bottom of the screen if you want to keep both options in play at once though.. If you do go for the Navigation Dock option, it'll take a little while for you to get used to navigating your phone with it, but when you do, you won't miss reaching for the usual buttons.. There are some productivity features tucked in the new UI too, including an option to connect the Mate 10 Pro to a PC (via a USB to DisplayPort or HDMI) for a full computer experience, a bit like Samsung's DeX setup but without the need for a dock.. Overall, and thankfully, EMUI 8 is now refined enough to allow you to have things pretty much like stock Android, or as customised as you can make it with Huawei's tweaks. Regardless of how you like your phone, none of the EMUI changes are likely to leave any previous Android user feeling lost.. I did have a few minor software niggles - EMUI has historically not played nicely with the password manager I use, for example. In this case, the phone consistently removes one of the permissions required to let you log into apps automatically. It's no deal-breaker, and likely won't be a problem for 99.9 per cent of potential purchasers, though.. Unlike some other Huawei devices tested in the past, the Mate 10 Pro does a good job of keeping most of the proprietary functions out of the way, unless you choose to actively use them. The UI night mode is a neat option you don't see many places, even if it doesn't work with third-party apps on the phone.. User experience & battery There are certain things you come to expect on a high-end smartphone; nowadays, that means things like waterproofing and biometric security - and you'll find these on the Mate 10 Pro too.. However, what you perhaps don't expect is a design that does so well at making the 6in panel feel smaller than it really is, and with a magical coating that makes it positively suicidal the moment you place it down on a surface.. Seriously, it's slightly more slippery than oil and appears to generate its own kinetic forces that propel it off any given surface. The result is that after just a few weeks of use, the review model we have is peppered with fairly significant scratches.. Nonetheless, assuming that most normal people would use the phone with a case and screen protector, it's not likely to be much of a problem in everyday life. Oddly - and most importantly - that rear glass panel doesn't make the phone slippery when being held.. the overall performance of the phone is outstanding - it didn't hang or lag once, not even when playing graphically demanding games or taking on some pretty serious multi-tasking and app switching. Given the internals of the Huawei Mate 10 Pro, that's perhaps not overly surprising, but it's a feeling that should be invaluable for a regular buyer using it as an everyday phone.. The expansive display, at 6in, is one of the best things about the phone - being both bright enough to remain visible on sunny days, and with enough pop to the colours to make movies and games really shine. Like the back of the phone, however, it is a bit of a fingerprint magnet.. Another of the best features of the Mate 10 Pro is its large 4,000mAh battery pack, which will see heavy users through a full day, and regular users up to two-days of battery life. It's an impressive feat that many phones claim, but few deliver against. Combined with the speedy performance and instant unlock fingerprint scanner, the overall impression of the handset is one of absolute capability.. There\s also an IR blaster, an almost retro throwback that I entirely appreciated, in the Mate 10 Pro too, but no 3.5mm headphone jack (though there is one in the regular Mate 10).. Camera For reviewers that want to pore over the detailed camera specs, the P10 Pro's Leica setup gives plenty to play around with - both in terms of different camera modes (portrait, wide aperture mode, moving image, etc.) and the hardware that has gone into making the camera in the phone.. That hardware, co-developed by Leica, consists of a 20MP monochrome sensor, combined with a 12MP RGB sensor, and unlike previous generations, truly seem to now show the point of the partnership.. Combining images from dual sensors is supposed to deliver sharper, better-balanced photos, even if you're shooting in dingy conditions. And thankfully, this time it actually works.. Whereas most smartphones demand well-lit environments, the Mate 10 Pro is perfectly happy in a darkened corner of a room. In fact, you might find that photos you do take in bright sunlight, for example, end up a little more overblown due to all that light. It's really just quibbling though; the camera takes some excellent shots in both conditions.. What that means is that the. Huawei Mate 10 Pro delivers a camera experience that's good enough to truly rely on for grabbing a quick, but excellent, shot. Plus, you have the option to play around taking some great monochromatic snaps too, using just the 20MP monochrome sensor.. That really is a big deal - knowing you can pull your phone out and snap a solid picture whatever you're trying to capture, in any environment, is no small feat for Huawei's phablet line.. And if you do want to dive deep into manual mode or play around with a wealth of different options, that's all present and waiting for you too.. Smartphones have, in recent years, faced two huge challenges to the user experience. One of those is delivering longer battery life, while still increasing processing power, and the second is low-light camera performance. With the Mate 10 Pro, Huawei's cracked both of those in one magnificent handset.. The weakest point of a Huawei phone, for me, has always been the software but even EMUI 8 mostly just stays out of your way if you want it to.. Sure, it doesn't have the same alluring curves of something like the S8/S8+, and it does have a tendency to launch itself off of tables, but the Mate 10 Pro delivered a near flawless user experience throughout the testing, which is much harder to achieve day-in, day-out over weeks.. With a retail price of £699, it's £100 cheaper than the same size Pixel 2 XL (plus that only has 64GB of storage, not 128GB) or S8+, nearly £200 below the Note 8's RRP and £200 more expensive than a OnePlus 5T with 128GB of storage. That puts the Huawei in a bit of a bind - having tested both the S8+ and the Mate 10 Pro, its performance is equally good, I just happen to prefer the look of the Galaxy series, but probably not to the tune of £100 more. And while it's a fair whack more expensive than the OnePlus, it also feels a fair amount more 'premium', as it should.. In the end, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro is a phone with which it's hard to find significant faults and easy to discover bits that you like, and you probably couldn't ask for a lot more in a phone than that.. The good Outstanding performance, excellent low-light camera performance, speedy fingerprint scanner, beefy battery.. The bad Huawei's EMUI won't appeal to all, the handset is incredibly slippy..

Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro are here — with some strange differences. You can now pre-order the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. The flagship phone game is pretty serious right now — with phones like the Google Pixel 2 XL and the. Apple iPhone 8 — but Huawei isn’t taking the competition lightly. The Chinese company unveiled the successor to the. the Huawei Mate 10 and Huawei Mate 10 Pro, late last year. It also took the wraps off of a budget version, called the Huawei Mate 10 Lite.. Both the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro feature a beautifully large edge-to-edge display that could go toe-to-toe against the Samsung Galaxy S8 , and they pack a Huawei-built processor that might give the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 a run for its money. Perhaps a little surprising, however, is how the phones are fairly different.. The Mate 10 Pro is not just a larger version of the standard Mate 10. Here’s a rundown of the two phones, and what they have to offer. For more reading, check out our. Only the Mate 10 Pro is available in the U.S., and it was originally going to launch on AT&T — a first for Huawei. deal reportedly fell through , with Verizon reportedly doing the same. Still, you’re now finally able to pre-order the Mate 10 Pro in the U.S. It costs $800, and you can order it from. Best Buy, Amazon, Microsoft, Newegg, and B&H. Official sales begin on February 18. customers will be able to get the phone in Midnight Blue and Titanium Grey, though Mocha Brown is also on the way. Those that pre-order before February 17 will also get a $150 gift card from whichever retailer you buy from.. The device is also available in more than 24 other countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Thailand, and the U.K.. The Porsche Design Mate 10 is also available, but at an absurdly high 1,395 euros (about $1,647). The phone will reportedly be available in the U.S. alongside the standard version of the Mate 10 Pro in February.. The Mate 10 won’t be coming to the U.S., but it does cost 700 euros (about $827) in countries including. Mexico, Spain, and the United Arab Emirates. Last but not least is the Mate 10 Lite, which is available in certain select markets like Australia and Pakistan. In Australia, the phone is available for AUD$499, which equates to around $400 USD.. We’re starting with the Mate 10 Pro because it’s the only one of the two you can purchase in the United States. This 6-inch AMOLED smartphone has skimpier edges around the screen than the regular Mate 10, and that’s largely because the fingerprint sensor sits on the back. The size allows for an 18:9 aspect ratio, with a surprisingly low 2160 x 1080-pixel resolution. At this size, most manufacturers offer a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, and it’s unclear why Huawei has gone with something lower.. The rear is covered with glass, and above the fingerprint sensor sits a dual camera set up.. One is a 20-megapixel monochrome camera, while the other is a 12-megapixel RGB camera with optical image stabilization. The LG V30 is the first smartphone with a f/1.6 aperture, but the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro are the first to use a f/1.6 aperture in both rear cameras. It allows the cameras to take in more light, so it should help in low-light environments. Like most smartphones with a dual-camera setup, there’s a portrait mode and a 2x hybrid zoom feature for close ups.. The Mate 10 Pro is powered by Huawei’s latest and greatest chip, the Kirin 970 , which also offers a so-called “Neural Processing Unit,” or a chip dedicated to processing neural networks. It’s coupled with 6GB of RAM, which should help with multitasking by keeping apps in memory. The NPU is the highlight here, as Huawei said it dramatically improves the speed of artificially intelligent queries, and it can offer up a smarter software experience. For example, if you’re watching a movie or playing a game and you get a notification, the phone will suggest split-screen mode so you don’t have to stop what you’re doing. If it detects you’re in a low-light setting, it will suggest turning on eye-comfort mode.. But one of the cooler implementations is with the camera, as the NPU allows the Mate 10’s camera to recognize objects in real time. This allows the camera to tune photos to certain presets. For example, if it recognizes you’re taking a food photo, it will try to boost the saturation of the food to make it look more appealing.. The Mate 10 Pro comes with 128GB of internal storage and no MicroSD card slot.. Unlike the standard Mate 10, the Pro offers an IP67 water-resistant rating. That means you can take it underwater up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. Sadly, there’s no headphone jack — for no specified reason — but on the bottom you’ll find a USB Type-C charging port. A USB Type-C to 3.5-mm headphone jack dongle will be included in the box if you want to use your wired headphones.. The regular Mate 10 also features skinny edges around the screen, but the bezels are slightly larger than the Mate 10 Pro. One reason is because the fingerprint sensor is on the front of the phone, unlike the rear sensor on the Pro. On the back, the phone offers the same vertically aligned dual-lens camera as the Mate 10 Pro, which was built in collaboration with Leica. The regular Mate 10 has the same all-glass design, but you may be happy to hear that there is a headphone jack on the top.. Unlike the Pro, there’s also a MicroSD card slot, though you get less internal storage — 64GB. The LCD display, however, offers a higher 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution despite a smaller 5.9-inch screen (16:9). The camera and the rest of the internals are the same, except instead of 6GB of RAM, the Mate 10 has 4GB.. You’ll find the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro running Android 8.0 Oreo with Huawei’s EMUI. They each also have a huge 4,000mAh battery and can charge back up fast thanks to Huawei’s SuperCharge technology. While the Mate 10 has a headphone jack, Mate 10 Pro owners may be disappointed about the option to use Bluetooth 4.2 rather than the newer Bluetooth 5 technology, which offers improved range and faster data transfer speeds.. The launch of the Huawei Mate 10 Lite certainly wasn’t as big as the original Mate 10 or Mate 10 Pro, but after some rumors it is now available in only a few markets. The device sports a dual-sensor camera on the back and on the front, with the rear facing shooter offering a 16-megapixel lens and a 2-megapixel lens, and the front-facing camera sitting in at 12-megapixel plus 2-megapixels. Under the rear-facing cameras, you’ll find a fingerprint sensor.. The display on the phone comes in at 5.9-inches with a resolution of. 2,160 x 1,080, and under the hood, unlike the other Mate 10’s, you’ll find Huawei’s Kirin 659 processor. You’ll get 64GB of storage, along with 4GB of RAM, which is a solid amount for a so-called “budget” phone.. With a USB Type-C-to-HDMI dongle, you’ll be able to plug the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro into an TV or monitor to use the phone in desktop mode. You can control the external display with the phone, or with a keyboard and mouse if they’re connected. You can continue using the phone separately while outputting to the TV. This puts the phones in serious competition with Samsung, which offers a desktop mode only if you purchase the Samsung DeX Station — you can’t use the Galaxy S8 or Note 8 when it’s in this docked mode..

The Huawei Mate 10 series is all about promises: the promise of AI on your smartphone; the promise of a rising star in the industry; the promise of a better long-term future for your device.. Buy Huawei Mate 10 Pro on Amazon. Buy Huawei Mate 10 on Amazon. Huawei has been hot on the heels of its main rival Samsung for years, building its global market, while slowly increasing its Western mind share. Itâs become in many ways the premier innovator in the smartphone space.. With the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro, Huawei has delivered its latest salvo in the battle against other mainstream manufacturers and the results are very compelling. Despite a few odd choices, like using a lower resolution screen and omitting the headphone jack on the Pro model, these devices are pretty incredible. This is the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro review, so let’s dive in.. Review scoring: After initially releasing this review with no review scoring, we’ve now run a final U.S. Mate 10 Pro through our full suite of Android Authority tests. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro ultimately won our Best of Android “ Smartphone of the Year ” award for 2017.. With the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro, Huawei has moved away from its signature all-metal design. Like most 2017 flagships, these phones opt for a glass front and back around an aluminum frame.. Huawei didn't add wireless charging, despite the change to a glass back.. This shift is a positive change. The phones look and feel magnificent, even if they collect fingerprints much more than their metal-clad predecessors. For some reason Huawei didn’t think adding wireless charging was necessary, despite the change to a glass back.. The two phones look almost identical from behind, barring the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner on the Pro version and their overall shape, which is slightly different. The Mate 10 Pro assumes the 18:9 aspect ratio, common to 2017 flagship displays. As such, it is taller and thinner than the Mate 10, which retains the traditional 16:9 ratio.. Despite the differences in size and shape, they weigh pretty much the same, at 178 grams for the Mate 10 Pro and 186 grams for the Mate 10. Compare that to the 190-gram Mate 9 or the 195-gram Galaxy Note 8 and you get a feel for their heft.. Compared to a similarly-sized phone like the LG V30 , which only weighs 158 grams, both Mate 10’s are relatively weighty for their size. However, they do have a 20 percent larger battery than both the Note 8 and V30, making that added heft totally worthwhile.. The main differences on the front are again fingerprint scanner-related. The Mate 10 squeezes an elongated scanner in the bottom bezel, which isnât actually much larger than the âbezel-lessâ Mate 10 Pro. The upshot of this placement is that the regular Mate 10 doesn’t have any front-facing branding, which some will love.. Both Mate 10's have a 20 percent larger battery than both the Galaxy Note 8 and LG V30.. There’s very little to dislike about either Mate 10 design, besides natural preferences for front- versus rear-mounted fingerprint scanners, manufacturer branding, and the presence of headphone ports (only the Mate 10 has one). If anything they just look a little unexciting, but these devices comfortably fit within Huawei’s understated-but-premium design language, which has always been better than most.. The display is where the Mate 10s are most different. Huawei has made some interesting decisions here. The Mate 10 Pro has an OLED screen with the fashionable 18:9, or Univisium, aspect ratio, and supports HDR10. On the other hand, the Mate 10 has a 16:9 aspect ratio and uses an IPS LCD panel instead, though it also has HDR10 certification. Neither panel has the rounded corners we’ve seen on several other flagships this year.. Huawei also decided to put QHD resolution on the regular Mate 10 only, although it defaults to Full HD out of the box. The Pro version ships with Full HD+.. The Mate 10 offers QHD resolution, while the Pro version ships with Full HD+.. The pixel density of the Mate 10 Pro is therefore significantly lower than the Mate 10’s, at 402 ppi compared to 498 ppi. While it is a noticeable difference, most users will make the decision based on which aspect ratio they prefer and whether they’re into LCD or OLED.. The upshot of the OLED panel on the Mate 10 Pro is the presence of an always-on display, though itâs oddly hidden in the settings by default. To enable it, go to Settings > Security & Privacy >Screen Lock & Passwords > Always Display Information and flip the switch.. Related: OLED vs LCD, Retina vs Infinity Display: Gary Explains. The always-on display will show the time, date, battery percentage and what music is playing, as well as app notificationsâ though only for Huaweiâs pre-loaded apps. So no WhatsApp, Gmail or Snapchat, kids. The Mate 10 Pro has great viewing angles, only suffering from color shift at extreme angles. The resolution difference is hardly noticeable, and even then youâve got to really look for it. The Mate 10 Pro’s OLED panel naturally produces better blacks and slightly punchier colors, but the Mate 10’s IPS LCD does an admirable job.. The Mate 10 has slightly weaker viewing angles, but both devices can hit 730 nits of brightness. Both are perfectly legible outdoors in bright sunlight. The Mate 10 display was a bit too cool for my tastes out of the box. It had a slightly blueish tint and a little less life to its colors. Fortunately, Huawei lets you adjust the color temperature in settings.. Mobile HDR: What’s all the fuss about?. Although itâs just becoming more common in smartphone displays, HDR has been a buzzword in the TV industry for several years. But actual TVs â with screen sizes of 65 inches or more practically being â¦. Both the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro support HDR10, and while neither worked with YouTube HDR content during the review period, Huawei assured me it was coming. Netflix and Vimeo are your best bet for HDR content right now. Both devices are also in the process of being Daydream-certified.. As always with Huawei, the hardware on the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro is impeccable. The build quality is excellent and the machining is top notch.. Both phones have a volume rocker and power button on the right, but only the Mate 10 Pro has a fine matte finish to it. They both have a single speaker grille on the bottom (the earpiece speaker provides the second speaker for stereo sound), a USB Type-C port, and a pair of pinhole mics.. On the left, a SIM card tray pops out to reveal dual-SIM slots on the Mate 10 Pro. The Mate 10âs got a hybrid dual-SIM slot, which lets you pick between a microSD card or a second SIM card.. The Mate 10 offers microSD expansion and a 3.5mm headphone port, neither of which appear on the Mate 10 Pro.. The Mate 10 comes in one model with 64 GB of on-board storage and 4 GB of RAM. The Mate 10 Pro has two models: one with the same pairing and another with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, but neither of which have microSD expansion.. Up top, there’s an IR blaster and another pinhole mic on both devices, but only the regular Mate 10 has a 3.5 mm headphone port. Because the Mate 10 and 10 Pro ship with Android Oreo , you can take advantage of a bunch of audio codecs (including aptX , aptX-HD and LDAC) for a better Bluetooth experience than you’d get on a pre-Oreo device. Note that the Mate 10’s use Bluetooth 4.2, so you won’t benefit from the additional range or higher throughput of Bluetooth 5.. Support for lossless 32-bit audio at 384 kHz is a nice touch of overkill but the presence of high-end codecs in Oreo and an included Type-C to 3.5 mm adapter will not be enough to satisfy every potential Mate 10 Pro buyer who prefers wired headphones. Huawei Histen audio tuning is available when you plug in though, and there’s some decent USB Type-C earbuds in the box.. There's lossless 32-bit audio at 384 kHz, high-end codecs in Oreo and an included Type-C to 3.5 mm adapter with the Mate 10 Pro.. The Mate 10’s external speakers get plenty loud, easily hitting 80 dB. At max volume it’s not the most pleasant audio experience. It gets a little tinny for my liking, especially from the earpiece speaker. If you keep it to around 80 percent volume, the result is perfectly acceptable, if not exceptional.. The Mate 10 series features the world’s fastest 4.5G modem with 5CC carrier aggregation, 4×4 MIMO, dual 4G VoLTE, 256-QAM and Cat.16 (Mate 10) and Cat.18 D (Mate 10 Pro) data speeds. Naturally, call quality was excellent, which is also assisted by AI-powered voice recognition and in-call noise cancellation.. Only the Pro has an IP67 dustproof and water-resistant rating (up to a meter for a half hour). The regular Mate 10 has an IP53 rating, which is on the don’t-count-on-it-for-anything-end of the spectrum.. The fingerprint scanner on both devices is lightning fast and reliable, just as we’ve come to expect from Huawei. Huawei says it unlocks the device in just 0.33 seconds, and I have no reason to doubt it.. Huawei has added âenhanced GPS technologyâ to its multi-sensor navigation, including inertia tracking and offline data to get you better location data when in tunnels or out of a service area. While I can’t say I found myself lost in the woods during the testing period, it’s a nice thing to have in the back of your mind if you ever do.. As an added bonus, both devices come with clear rubberized plastic cases to help mitigate fingerprints and save that shiny exterior from scratches and scrapes.. The Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro both ship with Huawei’s 10 nm HiSilicon Kirin 970 chipset, complete with a dedicated Neural Processing Unit for faster on-board AI processing. Gary Sims will be covering the NPU in far more detail soon. For now, it offers a relatively limited feature set which basically boils down to:. Huawei assures me that, over time, new features that take advantage of the NPU’s abilities will be added (rather than being held over for release with the Huawei P11 or Mate 11). Huawei has positioned the Kirin 970 as an open platform for mobile AI development, to encourage new applications to take advantage of the NPU. But theyâre also working with key partners to make that happen faster.. Check out these six ARCore experiments that Google has toyed around with. Announced as an answer to Apple's ARKit, Google's ARCore is positioned as the search giant's augmented reality platform for developers. Since its announcement, various developers have already created quirky experiences, which range from two cars â¦. For example, the next Android maintenance release, scheduled for later this year, will add support for Google’s ARCore. Google’s Neural Network APIs will also be added to the Mate 10 via an update early next year. Huawei is in the process of getting Google Translate to work with the NPU in the same way the Microsoft Translator app does.. The Kirin 970 uses an octa-core configuration made up of four high-performance Cortex A73 2.36 GHz cores and four energy-efficient Cortex A53 cores that clock in at 1.8 GHz. Along with an i7 co-processor, the SoC features the world’s first Mali-G72 MP12 GPU, as well as the brand new NPU.. I primarily used the 128 GB Mate 10 Pro with 6 GB of RAM during the testing period, and, while on paper it packs quite a punch, I encountered a few glitches. Like any phone, minor stutters appeared on occasion, but cleared up either after a restart or by clearing cached apps. Huawei actually put out two updates in the last week, so the versions that hit stores may be more stable. Note: I did find the stability of the Mate 10 Pro improved after a few more updates and experienced no real performance issues from the retail unit.. It wasnât just the usual stuff, though.. On two separate occasions, the Mate 10 wouldn’t unlock normally. Tapping the fingerprint scanner and power button had unusual results, neither doing what you’d expect. Tapping the fingerprint scanner either did nothing or showed the lock screen with a different battery percentage than on the always-on display. Pressing the power button didn’t always turn the screen on either. Sometimes I had to force-restart the phone to get things back to normal. It should be noted that both of these instances occurred after Google issued a bug fixing update and disappeared after a factory reset.. The Mate 10's offer considerable performance with the promise of getting better over time â or at least not degrading as fast as other phones.. Google apps didn’t always play nice with the Mate 10 Pro, either. Gmail would occasionally only show half a screen of emails. When switching to another account, it sometimes wouldn’t show any emails at all. Closing the app and restarting it cleared up the issue. Likewise, for a while all YouTube notifications came through with the same thumbnail, regardless of the channel.. If you can get beyond these issues as early teething problems or possibly related to Google’s bug fixing patch, the Huawei Mate 10 offers considerable performance with the promise of getting better over timeâ or at least not degrading as fast as other phones. Here’s some benchmarks to whet your appetite.. Both versions of the Mate 10 ship with a large 4,000 mAh battery and support Huawei Supercharge via the included 4.5V/5A charging brick. Charging a fully-depleted device with the power off, you’ll get between 30-35 percent charge in 15 minutes, 55-60 percent in a half hour and 85-90 percent after an hour (batteries charge slower the fuller they get). Huawei wants everyone to know its fast-charging solution is the first to be certified by TÃV Rheinland.. That 4,000 mAh cell will regularly get you somewhere between four and five hours of screen-on time * , depending on how bright your screen is set. I managed six hours on the Mate 10 Pro (with the dark theme enabled) in a day when I was inside with the screen constantly set to about 40 percent. I hit just under 7.5 hours on a day when it was set at about 25 percent brightness, but I only just scraped past three hours on the weekend when I was outside the whole time with max brightness enabled. I had no problem getting through the entire day with plenty to spare. *Note: Following the original publication of this review, the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro both received updates which noticeably increased their battery life. Post update, I was getting between four and five hours of screen-on time at max brightness and approached eight hours with brightness set to about half.. The Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro offer âAI-powered battery managementâ that promises to better allocate resources according to your personal habits. Much like Huawei’s âBorn Fast, Stay Fastâ machine learning optimization, it all sounds good, but you’ll have to wait until well after you’ve spent your money to see if it all comes true.. The Mate 10 has a satisfying battery management area that lets you check off various suggestions for saving power, including switching to a dark theme on the Mate 10 Pro, manually controlling power-intensive apps, limiting auto-syncing and more. You can also drop your screen resolution down, either automatically when your battery life requires it, or manually whenever you like.. There are some notable new features to EMUI, some of which are due to the Mate 10 shipping with Android 8.0 Oreo. Oddly, Huawei seems to have skipped out on a few Oreo features.. On the positive side, the settings menu has been cleaned up a little, falling more in line with Google’s compact layout in Oreo.. Oddly, Huawei seems to have skipped out on a few Oreo features.. Project Treble guarantees the potential for faster updates in the future and Huawei has confirmed the Mate 10 family will get two years of Android updates and at least one major Android version bump.. Oreo features like Picture-in-Picture mode, app shortcuts, smart text selection and notification dots â oddly called badge app icons â are on board. Others are absent, like the adaptive icons and the swipe-up app drawer on the Pixel. The default setting is still an app drawer-less home screen layout, but you can change that in settings.. You can snooze notifications but there are no notification channels on the Mate 10; it’s all or nothing.. It should be evident by now that you shouldn’t look to Huawei for a faithful implementation of Android Oreo to a T. Though Huawei falls down on implementing Google features, like the Samsung of old, it makes up for it with a vast bucket of software additions.. One of the coolest Huawei features debuting on the Mate 10 is Projection Mode. Simply buy a USB Type-C to HDMI cable with support for Display Port 1.2 and you can plug your phone directly into an external monitor â no dock required. In this mode you can add Bluetooth peripherals like a mouse or keyboard or use the phone’s display like a trackpad. You’ll need app support for full desktop mode, but other apps will still open, just in portrait mode like on your phone.. The experience works just as advertised too. Just plug in your phone, connect your mouse and keyboard and away you go. It’s a little sluggish â and you obviously can’t be charging your phone at the same time (if you’re using a one-to-one cable like I did) â but it works. It’ll be interesting to see where this type of functionality goes in future.. Note: I tested PC mode with a USB Type-C to HDMI cable I bought on Amazon – hence not being able to charge while in PC mode. Because the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro support USB 3.1 though, you can screen share to a monitor and charge the device at the same time. I tested two different powered USB 3.1 hubs with HDMI ports from Anker and both of them worked fine. If you plan to use PC mode for long stretches at a time, I’d recommend picking up a powered hub rather than a cable. are the hubs I tried, if you need a recommendation. In theory many others should work – but not many seem confident about claiming compatibility up front. I’m still waiting on an official comment from Huawei on the matter. Thanks to Bram Peeters for raising this issue.. My personal favorite new feature though has got to be the AI-powered translation feature. Living in a foreign country, I frequently have the need for translation, and I’ve never seen anything do it as fast as Microsoft Translator on the Mate 10. If Microsoft isn’t your cup of tea, Google Translate is in the pipeline as well.. It doesn’t have a live view feature like the Google Translate app, but Microsoft’s app can translate up to 50 languages almost instantaneously. Thanks to the NPU, it all happens on-device. It works on photos taken via the app, or existing photos, or even screenshots in your gallery. All you have to do is download the language packs you need and away you go. There’s also voice translation and keyboard input.. Huawei has also added a smart split-screen mode. When you’re watching a video or playing a game in full-screen mode, the Mate 10 will add a split-screen icon to most messaging apps’ popup notification. The app will then appear in a window side-by-side, while your video or game continues playing in the other.. A floating navigation dock lets you remove the on-screen navigation buttons and use a little floating ball like you would with fingerprint scanner gestures. On the Mate 10 you have fingerprint scanner gestures, the floating dock and on-screen button options, while on the Mate 10 Pro you only get the latter two.. Knuckle gestures return, with two of the more useful options being an ‘S’ to take a scrolling screenshot, and a double-knuckle double tap to start screen recording.. You now have 30 days to recover items deleted from the phone, after which theyâll be completely gone.. You can register a fingerprint to access a second version of your phone, so if your parents, girlfriend or immigration officials come snooping around and demand to see your phone, you can simply use your âcleanâ fingerprint to unlock that version. It takes a little while to open, but it works.. EMUI is a feature-packed Android skin, with most of the added benefits of Android Oreo as well. Huawei’s take on Android is a little rough around the edges, but there’s no denying the company is pushing the envelope where software features are concerned. Many of these could be called gimmicks, but a lot of them are really useful.. While it can be a little confusing, the Mate 10 software experience is generally smooth and rewarding. A lot of Huawei’s pre-loaded apps have little use, since Google has better ones available, and it would’ve been nice to see all of Oreo’s main features baked into Huawei’s version of Android 8.0, but EMUI is as clean and functional as it has ever been. Itâs still got a ways to go before I’d say it was great, though.. The Mate 10âs camera outperforms expectations in almost all situations. Beyond the physical hardware, which we’ll cover below, it is also assisted by the NPU in a few ways.. There’s currently 13 scenes that the NPU can recognize, automatically adjusting settings for optimum image capture. The number of compatible scenes will grow over time, and the phone reacts remarkably fast, outputting images of generally very good quality. You can always override the AI-predicted scene selection settings if you disagree, but only by going into the manual controls and switching to a preset. A simple on/off toggle in the camera would’ve been better.. The Mate 10âs camera outperforms expectations in almost all situations.. The Mate 10’s camera has a dual ISP for noise reduction and better low-light performance with a 4-way hybrid autofocus comprising laser, depth, contrast and phase detection. The Kirin 970’s NPU capabilities also enable an AI-powered bokeh mode, AI Motion Detection for reduced motion blur and a hybrid digital zoom, all of which are above average.. The Mate 10 has two Summilux-H lenses with f/1.6 aperture: one RGB sensor at 12 MP and a monochrome sensor at 20 MP resolution. They are again co-engineered with Leica and the main RGB sensor has OIS which helps a lot in low light situations.. The Mate 10 camera takes very good shots in a simple point-and-shoot scenario, with a little variation. There’s very little noise to be found in low light shots, and the OIS helps with motion blur. But it must be noted that, to get those grain-free shots, the Mate 10 tends to crush blacks a bit and slightly darken the overall scene in the resulting photograph. Depending on your tastes, it maintains better image integrity after the fact, but low light photos can be a little less poppy and light than those shot on the Pixel 2 or Note 8 for example.. In contrast to this slight underexposure, bright spots in low-light photos tend to be a little blown out, like in the shot of the river above. The scene wasn’t quite as dark as this shot would imply, but the warning lights on the bridge are half white and half red, a fact the Pixel 2 managed to pick up, even if there was much more noise in the photo.. Where other devices balance things out a little more at the cost of added grain , the Mate 10 seems to be on a mission to stamp out noise at the expense of color and “reality”. Personally, I appreciate the sharper details, and I can always lighten the shadows in post, but your mileage may vary.. Oddly enough, a more familiar result comes when using the hybrid digital zoom. The level of detail achieved is quite remarkable, but the overall image is much lighter than the regular shot with its pitch blacks. You get more noise, but there’s also much more visible in the shadows, as you can see in the shot of Berlin’s TV Tower above. The hybrid zoom definitely produces more detail than a zoomed-in regular photo.. Bizarrely, I found the Mate 10's HDR mode to be a little unreliable. A similar level of hit-or-miss occurred with the AI scene selection.. Bizarrely, I found the Mate 10’s HDR mode to be a little unreliable. A similar level of hit-or-miss occurred with the AI scene selection. The Mate 10 has a tendency to produce very different photos if you shoot a couple in a row. Normally this could be explained by the AI not recognizing the scene in one of them. In HDR mode, even when focused on the exact same spot, the phone would lighten shadows in some photos, but darken them in others. You almost always get a great shot, but I’d recommend always firing off a couple just to have options.. The AI Motion Detection function is really impressive. I took several shots that on almost any other phone would’ve produced at least some degree of blur, even in good lighting, but the Mate 10 managed crisp shots without a hint of movement. From a shot of basketballers jumping in the air in decent but overcast lighting, to a running frisbee shot in low light, the Mate 10’s ability to capture moving subjects without blur was impressive.. The bokeh mode is also pretty good. While these software modes have improved across the board in the last year, the Mate 10 does an admirable job, lining up well against the Pixel 2, even if that phone manages the effect with dual pixels rather than a dual lens setup.. The software missteps on occasion, but the results are generally more than good enough for a new profile pic or social share. They always look a little artificial, but in the absence of a DSLR or mirrorless camera, it’s the next best thing.. The front-facing 8 MP f/2.0 lens is perfectly fine for the average selfie, but if you want the best shots you’d do better perfecting your selfie arm to use the main sensor. I took a few shots covering the monochrome sensor, and while thereâs less detail, it’s barely noticeable even when zoomed right in. As a fan of the LG V30’s wide-angle camera, I can only imagine how amazing this camera would be with that as a secondary lens or even a 2x zoom lens.. If I had to criticize the Mate 10 camera it'd be for over-sharpening.. If I had to criticize the Mate 10 camera it’d be for over-sharpening, which can be pushed to such an extreme that the resulting photos look fake. Some of this may be down to the AI scene detection, but as you can see in this photo of a dog yawning, the ISP has tried so hard to sharpen up the details that it ends up looking odd. This other shot of a dog looks perfectly fine though.. You can pick a color profile from standard, vivid or smooth colors. All the usual Huawei camera modes are also there, including monochrome, 3D panorama, light painting, night shot and slo-mo. Pro mode is also there if you want full control over ISO, white balance, exposure compensation, shutter speed and more. Itâs even got a motion photo option like you’ll find on the Pixel 2 or iPhone.. Where the Mate 9 was a manual photographer’s dream, the Mate 10 has stepped up its full auto game. The addition of AI produces some great results, even if the handling of shadows and low light might not be to everyone’s tastes. Occasionally you will feel like youâre battling against our new AI overlords as you struggle to retain control over the resulting photo, though.. If the cameras on Huawei phones put you off in the past because they seemed too complicated, those days are over. The Huawei Mate 10 is just as good a point-and-shoot smartphone camera as any other. It just has a little âcharacterâ you’ll need to get used to, or just go full manual.. The Huawei Mate 10 is a the most mainstream smartphone the company has ever produced. It retains its slick looks while switching to the current trend of a glass front and back. It retains its massive battery while adding an even more efficient chipset and AI optimizations. It takes what used to be a full-featured but complicated camera and makes it incredibly reliable for pick-up-and-shoot photographers.. Huawei is among the first to ship with Android Oreo out of the box, but software is where the Mate 10 is let down a little. EMUI is convoluted, confusing and occasionally downright weird. There are more software features here than you can poke a stick at, but it’ll take you a good long while to discover them all and you can expect a few hiccups along the way.. Huawei is really bringing its A-game with the Mate 10 though, putting up its most convincing challenge to competing devices like the Note 8, Pixel 2 and V30 yet. Huawei’s brand name may still not be as popular in the West as the company would like it to be, but devices like the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro will help turn that around.. Despite a few questionable choices, the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro are really nice phones. The weird mixture of missing features between them will make picking one a slightly harder task, as not all the âbestâ features are necessarily in the Pro model. Where a company like Samsung knows you’re better off putting all your eggs in the flagship basket, Huawei is taking a risk here.. At 699 euro, the Mate 10 has all the regular bases covered, but at 799 euro the Mate 10 Pro is only superior in some ways. It’ll be the only version to make it to the US though, with local pricing and availability coming soon.. There’s an awful lot to love about the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro, and, while they might not yet be meeting Samsung head to head, they’re another positive step in that direction. If Huawei comes through on all — or even most — of the promises the Mate 10 makes, then they’re guaranteed to only get better over time.. Buy Huawei Mate 10 Pro on Amazon.
