What is a hands on review?. If music is your bag, then the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle gives you flagship quality playback at a fraction of the cost.. Misses out on Desire 10 Pro features. Release date and price Design and display Listen up What's it like to use? Camera and battery Verdict. Can you hear that? It's the sound of a smartphone offering best-in-class audio – at least that's what HTC wants you to believe with its latest mid-range marvel, the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle.. The phone arrives as one half of a double act, with the higher-spec Desire 10 Pro taking most of the limelight, and with it a higher price tag, while the Desire 10 Lifestyle takes the trendy, lower-cost route in search of underground fame.. Is the audio experience alone really enough for the Desire 10 Lifestyle to stand out from its other half though? The Lifestyle misses out on a fingerprint scanner, 1080p resolution, flagship camera, laser auto-focus and two-tone flash – all of which the Desire 10 Pro has.. The Desire 10 Lifestyle isn't void of features though, and with a lower price tag to its name there's still a good chance it'll stake a claim in the mid-range market.. The HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle's release date is currently unknown, but with the Desire 10 Pro scheduled for an October arrival we expect the Lifestyle to show up around the same time.. Whether you'll be able to choose between the Lifestyle and Pro in your country remains to be seen, as HTC has yet to confirm which countries the two phones will be landing in, but we do know the Lifestyle will be coming to the UK, while the Pro will not.. In the UK the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle price has been set at £249 for the 3GB/32GB variant, which makes it rather attractive. We're still waiting to hear prices for the rest of the world, but a HTC spokesperson told TechRadar that we can expect a sub-$300 (AU$400) price tag in the US.. There's a pleasingly premium finish to the Desire 10 Lifestyle, with the soft-touch polycarbonate body strengthened by a metal frame beneath – but while the metal is premium, it's the polycarbonate that has a warming presence in the hand.. The phone grips nicely against the palm for a comfortable hold, which is useful seeing as this is a pretty big handset at 156.9 x 76.9 x 7.7mm, although at 155g it's not as heavy as you might expect.. You can pick up the Desire 10 Lifestyle in four colors: black, dark blue, light blue and white – and all have a golden metal frame as an accent throughout the design.. Up top there's a 3.5mm headphone jack, while on the base of the handset you'll find a micro USB port and a bass speaker, which works in unison with a standard speaker at the top of the phone. This is the same BoomSound Hi-Fi Edition speaker setup you'll find on the flagship HTC 10 .. The screen is a 5.5-inch offering with a 720p resolution, although there's not a great deal of difference in clarity between the Lifestyle's display and the one on the 1080p Pro.. Hi-Res audio is the order of the day with the Desire 10 Lifestyle – whether you're using the built-in speakers or plugging in a set of headphones, HTC wants to give your ears the best experience.. The built-in HTC BoomSound Hi-Fi Edition speakers include a separate tweeter and subwoofer. The former is located at the top of the device with the earpiece, while the subwoofer resides on the base of the handset. This means that high-frequency sounds and bass tones are separated, supposedly delivering something closer to Hi-Fi sound than phone speakers can typically manage.. Crank the volume up on your favorite track and the Desire 10 Lifestyle produces room-filling audio that's a far cry from the distorted mess you get from a lot of smartphones. The bass isn't going to be shaking your light fittings, but it is more noticeable than on rival handsets.. Plug in headphones and music sounds superb, especially if you have access to Hi-Res tracks. We listened to a couple of tracks during our hands-on time with the Desire 10 Lifestyle, and can confirm that the playback quality will please audiophiles.. The HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle features a Snapdragon 400 processor, a chip usually found in entry-level devices, and we're a little disappointed to find the phone's not packing the mid-range 600 series.. The processor is coupled with either 2GB or 3GB of RAM, depending on whether you opt for 16GB or 32GB of internal storage, and given the choice we'd certainly recommend the 3GB/32GB variant for slicker performance and more space for your apps and games.. If you can only get hold of the 2GB/16GB version of the Desire 10 Lifestyle you can at least expand the storage, as the phone has a microSD slot which supports cards up to a whopping 2TB in size.. Android Marshmallow ran smoothly during our brief time with the phone, although a few apps did take a little while to load. The handset we were using wasn't running final software, so things could improve before it hits shelves, but we fear the phone may struggle a little with high-intensity gaming.. On the back of the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle you'll find a 13MP camera, which is capable of taking some rather nice shots, and should suffice given the phone's mid-range price tag.. Around the front a 5MP camera awaits for all your selfie needs, complete with a 'live make-up' mode if you're having a bad face day.. The Lifestyle is powered by a 2700mAh non-removable battery, which HTC reckons can give you up to eight hours of HD video playback or up to 50 hours of audio playback – which is a decent amount of time if true.. Thanks to fast-charging support the phone should be able to juice-up quickly as well – we'll be sure to put the battery through its paces in our in-depth review very soon.. If music is your bag, then the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle gives you flagship-quality playback at a fraction of the cost of other similarly-equipped phones, and for some that's great news.. The thing is, though, the Lifestyle will only likely appeal to a small segment of the market, with the Desire 10 Pro enjoying wider appeal and rival handsets likely offering more well-rounded experiences for a similar price. We're intrigued to see how the Lifestyle fares.. What is a hands on review?. 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 32 GB + MicroSD. Release date: Oct 1, 2016. View all photos (36). Click to read the full review. Low pixel density screen (267 ppi). The HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle features a 1.6 GHz, quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 SoC under its hood, 2 GB or 3 GB of RAM, and 16 GB or 32 GB of storage under the hood, depending on which variant you pick up. The display has a hefty 5.5-inch diagonal, but a not-so-impressive resolution of 720 x 1080 pixels (267 PPI). The selfie camera has a 5 MP sensor with a F2.2 aperture, while the main snapper on the back is a 13 MP one, with the same F2.2 aperture. All of this is powered by a rather modest 2,700 mAh battery, though, it should do well when only powering a Snapdragon 400 and an HD display.. HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle Review HTC Desire 10 lifestyle manual HTC Desire 10 lifestyle benchmarks. Dimensions: 6.18 x 3.03 x 0.30 inches (156.9 x 76.9 x 7.7 mm). Weight: 5.47 oz (155 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 5.5 inches. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus (Laser), Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Touch to focus, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Features: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 24.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 28.0 days (672 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20, 28. Data: LTE Cat 4 (150/50 Mbit/s), HSPA. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: NFC, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 20 Sep 2016. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. We list only the specs that are different than the main variant. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. posted by Damian M.. HTC - HTC + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction The HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle is a mid-range Android smartphone that's not for everyone. While it does have its pros, there are more than enough cons to weigh it down. The handset isn't available in the US, but European customers can get it for around $300, which makes it a bit more expensive than most of its competitors. We'll let you decide for yourself if the price is worth it. So, let's get straight into it, shall we? In the box: HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle USB to Micro-USB cable Wall charger Hi-res audio headphones Wrist strap Various booklets Design The HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle comes in four color variants – Polar White, Stone Black, Royal Blue and Valentine Lux (a gentle light blue). We have the Stone Black up for review, and we have to admit it looks pretty good. The device features some gold-coloured accents on top of its all-plastic design, which really make it stand out. We would prefer metal or glass, but the price sort of justifies the materials. And despite the all-plastic design and bigger form factor, the phone feels pretty good in the hand. It doesn't slip and slide anywhere, and it feels sort of natural to hold. The physical power button on the side has a nice clicky feel to it that provides more than enough tactile feedback without being too flimsy. The top and bottom bezels around the 5.5” screen could use a bit of trimming, but they're not that big either. Especially considering that the bottom one houses three capacitive touch buttons. The volume rockers on the right side of the handset feel a little awkward to use. They're way too flat and, unlike the power button directly below them, don't provide much feedback when pressed. But with enough time to get used to them, they could be deemed as passable. The left side of the device houses the two Nano SIM slots and a microSD slot for storage expansion. According to the official specifications, it should be able to handle a microSD card with up to 2 TB of capacity. The bottom side of the phone holds the wrist strap hook, micro USB port and the handset's speakers, while the top only has a 3.5 mm port. Display The Desire 10 Lifestyle features a 5.5” LCD screen, with a resolution of 720x1280 pixels. This makes for a pixel density of 267 ppi, which is good enough for browsing the web or reading e-books. When it comes to colors, you have a choice. The HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle offers a color temperature slider in its settings, which lets you customize how cool or warm you want your colors to be. By default the display is somewhat cool, however. Viewing angles probably present the biggest compromise in the display department, as visuals get rather washed out when viewed at medium to wide angles.. 6.18 x 3.03 x 0.3 inches. 156.9 x 76.9 x 7.7 mm. 5.97 x 2.99 x 0.31 inches. 151.7 x 76 x 7.8 mm. 5.86 x 2.95 x 0.31 inches. 148.9 x 74.9 x 7.9 mm. 5.65 x 2.63 x 0.31 inches. 143.6 x 66.8 x 7.9 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. HTC Desire 10 lifestyle Compare.

"The device does feature some pretty loud stereo speakers, but still, don't expect wonders from them. They may sound a bit noisy at times, especially if you listen to busier songs, with lots of instruments playing at the same time. " - What were you expecting, a busy song yet not noisy? :O.

Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. HTC's Desire 10 phones make midrange power feel more premium. The last time we saw a new Desire phone, HTC had basically speckled it with paint in the name of fashion. We can't blame them -- the effect was pretty damn cool -- but now the company is trying something a little different with the new Desire 10 Lifestyle and Pro. HTC's midrange work is getting wrapped up in a classy new look, and (spoiler alert) it's a pretty impressive change. The Lifestyle is set to hit certain markets this month, ahead of the more expensive Pro model in November. Gallery: First look: HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle and Pro | 21 Photos. As you've easily deduced, the Pro is the more powerful of the Desire 10 twins. That's mostly thanks to the octacore MediaTek Helio P10 chip inside, assisted by either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. The 3GB model comes with 32GB of storage, versus 64GB on the 4GB edition. That should be plenty of power to render things on the 5.5-inch, 1080p IPS LCD screen and keep everything moving at a respectable clip. It's always a little tricky to get a sense of what a phone is capable of prelaunch, but poking around in the lightly skinned build of Android 6.0 Marshmallow felt more than adequately snappy. Anyway, just above that screen is a 13-megapixel camera (with a software-powered wide-angle selfie trick to boot), while a 20-megapixel camera sits on the opposite side. Below that you'll find a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor -- a nice touch that you don't often see in midrange devices.. All of that (plus a 3,000mAh battery) is packed into a handsome frame, with a matte body that's criss-crossed with gold-colored antenna bands. This is all a far cry from the youthful Desire 530 ; the Desire 10 Pro isn't as exuberant as it is elegant. The tight tolerances and sturdy feel definitely give the 10 Pro a more premium air, and HTC's color choices don't hurt either. (The phone will be available in black, white, navy blue and a light blue the company's calling "Valentine Lux."). You'd be forgiven for thinking the Desire 10 Lifestyle is a barely different variant. After all, the Lifestyle looks basically identical to its pricier sibling despite its more modest spec sheet. There are some tell-tale signs, though, like the lack of a fingerprint sensor and a smaller flash setup under its main 13-megapixel camera. Once the Desire 10 Lifestyle is on, the phone's lower-end ambitions are confirmed by the 5.5-inch, 720p Super LCD screen. It's still decently bright and vivid, if not the crispest out there. The rest of the differences are under the hood: There's a slightly pokier Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset clocked at 1.6GHz, either 2GB or 3GB of RAM, 2700mAh of battery power, and 32GB or 64GB of storage.. There is one other big deviation from the Pro, however: The Desire 10 Lifestyle packs support for 24-bit high-res audio like the flagship 10. Sure, you'll lose out on a crisper screen and biometric unlocking, but the lure of improved audio is still pretty tantalizing. That's also the sort of feature that rarely pops up in lower-end smartphones, so here's hoping that trend keeps up for a while. And beyond that, HTC's build quality impresses even when it comes to less expensive hardware (think around £249 in the UK). From a distance, there aren't any discernible, physical differences between the Pro and the Lifestyle.. As usual, HTC is leaving most of the pricing and availability details up to the carriers and retailers themselves, but if you're in the US, you can just put your wallet away. It'll be a least a little while before either version of the Desire 10 winds up around these parts, and probably longer still if the Desires turn out to be hits and supplies get constrained. After a short time spent with HTC's new devices, it was clear to me that the bar representing "good enough" smartphone performance has gotten pretty high. Then again, even the "best" phones aren't guaranteed successes: The 10 was the best device HTC had built in years, and even its quality and performance couldn't drive huge demand for it.. android , desire , desire10 , desire10lifestyle , desire10pro , gear , hands-on , htc , midrange , mobile , oem , smartphone.

HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle Smartphone Review. Florian Wimmer ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 12/14/2016. Android ARM Smartphone Touchscreen. HTC has often tried to score with stylish looks, hi-res sound, and decent cameras. Thus, HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle dual-SIM handset is an interesting offer in the mid-range. Can the 720p panel and relatively slow SoC stop this wave?.

Buyers now get quite a bit of smartphone for around 300 Euros (~$314): screens with Full HD resolution, high-end SoCs, and high-resolution cameras are no longer unique. The Chinese manufacturer OnePlus was a trendsetter here. HTC also takes this approach of implementing high-end features in the mid-range, however, not in terms of screen and SoC but rather in terms of sound and casing. HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle is to revitalize things and comes with a metal casing available in four colors and 24-bit hi-res audio.. HTC demands 299 Euros (~$313) for its 5.5-inch smartphone, which is even much cheaper than the latest model by OnePlus, the. The screen's low resolution and slow SoC perplexed us. How will HTC fare with its Desire 10 Lifestyle in the mid-range that has become hard fought in the meantime?. Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 MSM8928 Qualcomm Adreno 305.

HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle wants to provoke interest by means of gold-colored elements on the casing. However, this bit of bling-bling is still very restrained and would satisfy Russian ladies just as much as west coast rappers. At least, HTC tries to escape the color monotony and offers two blue tones in addition to black and white. However, currently these are not available in Germany and thus it remains rather uninteresting here in Germany.. The casing with its metal bezel is stiff and furnished with a matte surface (except for the front). Strong pressure on the front and back leaves the screen unimpressed. However, the relatively large, 5.5-inch smartphone can be warped clearly, and then it produces a very audible cracking noise.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. With 3 GB of working memory and 32 GB of storage capacity, HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle is in the midfield of the comparison devices. Some offer a memory configuration of 4 GB / 64 GB in this price range, others like LG's Stylus 2 and Lenovo's Moto G4 Plus come with only 1.5 or 2 GB of working memory and 16 GB of storage. Users who save a lot of files can also insert a micro-SD card with a maximum of 2 TB and store the files there. Compatible apps can also be moved to the SD card. It is also possible to connect external storage devices to the USB port via an adapter thanks to USB OTG support.. Lower edge: Wrist strap anchor point, speaker, USB 2.0. HTC uses Android 6.0.1 with quite outdated security patches from 1 June 2016. OS updates were not available at test time, and the older SoC excludes an update to Android 7. Consequently, buyers who value an up-to-date operating system will unlikely be happy with HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle.. HTC tries to compensate this circumstance via preloaded software: Android has only been modified slightly, but the "BlinkFeed" notification overview that is opened by swiping left is an interesting extension. "HTC Connect" is to facilitate streaming content in the DLNA capable home network. Opened apps can be closed to clear memory with "Boost+". "Zoe VideoEditor" allows creating personal slide shows from taken videos and photos. Although all this is nifty and functions well, most features can be found in third-party apps in Google's Play Store.. HTC has fortunately not preloaded adware and only some social networking apps are installed.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle supports LTE - but this can be expected for almost 300 Euros (~$314). The maximum speed of 150 MBit per second (download) and 50 MBit per second (upload) is standard. Eight LTE bands are supported: four UMTS and four GSM bands. That is usually sufficient in Europe, but the smartphone is not very suitable for globetrotters.. HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle is not up-to-date in terms of Wi-Fi networks: Only the 802.11 b/g/n standards are supported. The faster ac standard and 5-GHz network support are absent. In view of the possible transmission standards, the speed of approximately 100 MBit per second in send and receive are quite acceptable..

The GPS module also does a good job in indoor tracking with an accuracy of approximately 11 meters (36 ft) here. It is fast and achieves a decent four meters (13 ft) outdoors.. We jumped on our bikes for a better evaluation of the smartphone's navigation capabilities and also packed in Garmin's Edge 500 for comparison. The Desire 10 Lifestyle located us quite decently although occasional signal losses were observed. Garmin's navigation system was considerably more accurate here, and it even recorded the slightest curve while the Desire 10 Lifestyle often simply drew a straight line between two remote measuring points..

HTC relies on its self-developed phone app that is still similar to Google's stock app. Lists for contact groups and favorites can be created, and a call list and keypad with word suggestions that fade in when starting to dial are present. The app is user-friendly but we did not discover a real advantage over Google's stock app. Convenient: the number keyboard can be zoomed for seeing the numbers better.. The call quality did not convince us: metallic interference noises, static, muffled voices are what we heard. This was the case when using both the earpiece and the speakers, which have actually always been one of the strengths of HTC's smartphones. Considerably higher-quality smartphones exist for making calls even in this price range:. from the comparison group offer much better call quality.. HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle relies on a rear-facing 13-megapixel camera and a front-facing 5-megapixel camera. Thus, it offers the lowest resolution cameras in the comparison field just in terms of pixel count. However, HTC has often made more of fewer pixels. Will this also be the case in HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle?. The photos shot with the front-facing camera look well illuminated and fairly sharp at first. However, the user should not zoom in on them too strongly because inaccuracies soon become evident. Videos can be recorded in 1080p using the front-facing camera. The quality is rather mediocre: Visible color noise is seen in dark areas, and the illumination only adapts very slowly when changing from bright to dark places.. The primary camera only has a simple LED flash and a conventional autofocus. The photos make a relatively pale and inaccurate impression. A visible image noise in large color fields appears in low-light conditions and the exposure is not always set ideally. Dark areas are often outlined weakly. The primary camera records videos in 1080p that are much better than those of the front-facing camera. The transition from dark to light is also faster. However, the autofocus often functions inaccurately, making manual corrections necessary.. Annoying: Videos recorded with our review sample were stored with wrong position sensor data so that portrait mode videos were displayed in landscape mode and vice versa.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. Visible inaccuracies can also be seen when we photograph the test chart with the primary camera in defined light conditions in our studio. Furthermore, the colors look relatively pale. This is also our impression when we look at the color test photo of CalMAN: The color reproduction is definitely falsified.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. In addition to the charger and USB cable, HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle comes with a wrist strap that can be attached to the smartphone. A standard in-ear headset is also included.. On its website HTC offers all kinds of accessories that are not custom-made for the Desire 10 Lifestyle and that are thus compatible with several devices: A quick-charger is sold for just below 24 Euros (~$25), a hi-res headset that is presently sold out, and a smartphone holder for the car are also available.. The keyboard app that HTC uses is called TouchPal. It features diverse settings, such as dividing the keyboard or new themes matching to Christmas or favorite soccer league. The keyboard's height and width can also be adapted and an editing mode can be enabled. Additional dictionaries that, for example, include local terms or business language, can be added. However, not all features are free and a premium subscription with all contents costs around 5 Euros (~$5) per year. If this is unwanted, it is always possible to switch to Google's stock app. The keyboard itself is clearly arranged and easy to use.. The menu buttons are implemented outside the screen and respond accurately. The volume control could be could be easier to feel in our opinion. In return, the grooved standby button is easy to find.. The touchscreen responds very accurately even in the corners and at the edges. "Motion Launch" involves gestures that can be made on a disabled screen, for example, to unlock the smartphone.. The relatively big 5.5-inch screen in HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle has a resolution of just 1280x720 pixels. has four times the pixel count. There is no need for this in a smartphone, but Full HD panels are an evident improvement in this size. Consequently, single pixels are visible in diagonal lines and the image does not make as sharp an impression on the Desire 10 Lifestyle as on other smartphones in this price range.. The maximum brightness of 380 cd/mÂ² is also rather mediocre. In return, the brightness distribution of 92 percent is relatively homogeneous and no brightness differences are visible on larger colored areas.. 365 cd/m² 376 cd/m² 350 cd/m² 360 cd/m² 380 cd/m² 374 cd/m² 363 cd/m² 378 cd/m² 373 cd/m². 92 % Center on Battery: 380. cd/m²) ΔE Color 6.6 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 7.4 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 96.6% sRGB (Calman) Gamma: 2.29.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. The black level benefits from the overall relatively low brightness: Dark pixels only shine at 0.29 cd/mÂ². This very good rate results in an also very good contrast ratio of 1462:1. However, the displayed colors are not very vivid.. The reason for this becomes clear when examining it with our spectrophotometer and CalMAN software. The color accuracy is not particularly high and a minor bluish tint is visible in the grayscale levels. However, the color temperatures can be adjusted in the system, and color accuracy improves in the setting "Warm"..

This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The panel's relatively low brightness has to defy the glossy screen outdoors. It accomplishes this feat reasonably well. Contents are only difficult to read in especially bright environments.. Thanks to the IPS panel, the viewing angles are good. However, visible brightness shifts appear when tilting the screen up and down (in landscape mode).. The performance chapter is interesting, as HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle is not based on an exactly cutting edge SoC:. comes from 2013, is not 64-bit capable, has four cores, and a maximum clock rate of 1.6 GHz. LG's Stylus 2 relies on a newer SoC and thus calculates faster than our review sample, which places it last place in terms of system speed and computing power.. achieves a four times higher score in some benchmarks.. Our review sample also ends up in the last place here.. But what does it look like in real-world use? We experienced apps crashing several times during our tests. Some apps needed longer to launch. However, it is possible to navigate smoothly through the menu thanks to Android's frugality. More modern benchmarks that are based on OpenGL ES 3.1 do not run, and thus current effects cannot be displayed in games.. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle.

As to memory access, we first look at the micro-SD card reader. We test the transfer rate with our Toshiba Exceria Pro M401 reference card. HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle is very sluggish with 50 to 70 percent slower transfer rates than the comparison devices.. Only LG's Stylus 2 is even slower when accessing the internal storage.

The older SoC prevents modern effects in games. However, since the latest interfaces are downward compatible, all games that we tested ran on HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle. " Asphalt 8" only reached an average of 18 frames in high settings, which is too little for smooth gameplay. " Dead Trigger 2 " just still ran smoothly at 29 frames. More basic games like " Angry Birds 2 " are no challenge for the smartphone, but the slow storage access is noticed in long loading times.. Navigating via touchscreen and position sensor functioned accurately and smoothly.. The temperature development of HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle is beyond reproach. The maximum load temperature is 37.4 degrees Celsius (99.32 Fahrenheit). Although this temperature is felt slightly, it is in no way critical. The idle temperatures are considerably lower with a maximum of 31.7 Â°C (89.06 Â°F).. We check whether the SoC throttles during prolonged load with GFXBench Battery Test that renders the same sequence thirty times in succession. The frame rates hardly differ from the first to the last run so that throttling can be excluded.. 35.4 °C 33.6 °C 33.4 °C. 37.4 °C 34.1 °C 34.9 °C. 35.8 °C 34 °C 33.3 °C.

HTC relies on the number one sales argument that Taiwanese manufacturers have been doing best for a long time now: Incorporating first-rate sound in their smartphones. This was usually reserved for premium devices until now. HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle is the first mid-range model that comes with 24-bit hi-res sound. HTC's proprietary "BoomSound" technology in conjunction with Dolby is to add more bang to the sound.. Although the speakers do not get excessively loud in the Pink Noise test, they feature finely balanced mids and trebles. Even a bit more bass is present than in other smartphone speakers. In fact, the speakers are hardly inferior to those in high-end devices. The opposite is true: The warm sound with clear low ranges make HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle unique for a mid-range smartphone.. Audible differences to the also good sound of OnePlus' 2 when using high-quality headphones with HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle are heard. The feeling that even more nuances are audible and that music is considerably more balanced is conveyed. However, this effect does not evolve with cheap headsets. The sound is also good via Bluetooth, but whether a difference is heard again depends on the speaker quality.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 28.7 26.5 28.7 25 25.5 27 25.5 31 24.4 26.9 24.4 40 30.2 30.3 30.2 50 31 25.2 31 63 22 23.1 22 80 22.6 21.7 22.6 100 25.1 23.3 25.1 125 35.7 31.4 35.7 160 28.7 20.7 28.7 200 40.1 20 40.1 250 49.6 20.4 49.6 315 54.8 21.1 54.8 400 57 19.6 57 500 57.2 20.9 57.2 630 56.5 20.1 56.5 800 57.9 21 57.9 1000 59.6 17.9 59.6 1250 62.2 17.6 62.2 1600 65.6 16.6 65.6 2000 67.3 16.7 67.3 2500 66.2 15.2 66.2 3150 63.3 16.2 63.3 4000 62.3 15.2 62.3 5000 64.3 14 64.3 6300 61.6 13.8 61.6 8000 59.2 13.6 59.2 10000 60 13.6 60 12500 61 13.8 61 16000 56.3 13.4 56.3 SPL 75.3 29.3 75.3 N 34.2 1.2 34.2 median 59.2 HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle median 17.6 median 59.2 Delta 6.6 2.8 6.6 31.6 36.7 25.4 32.8 25.3 29 32.9 35.2 33.6 49.7 31.6 32.3 28.4 29.3 27 25.7 20.8 28 22 39.1 21.3 46.8 20.8 55.6 21.2 59.4 19.4 63.2 19.5 69.4 17.7 72.5 17.9 73.7 17.8 75.1 17.3 75.9 17.4 76.1 16.7 77.9 17.2 77.5 18.2 77.7 17.9 76.5 17.6 73.7 17.7 68.2 17.8 61.2 17.9 53.5 18.1 56.1 18.2 51 30 87.1 1.3 66.1 median 17.9 ZTE Axon 7 median 68.2 1.3 11.7 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Frequency diagram in comparison (checkboxes above can be turned on/off!). Unfortunately, our power consumption measurements of HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle did not present any useful results.. With 2700 mAh or 10.3 watt hours, the battery in HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle is a bit smaller than the ones in the comparison devices. However, this does not necessarily mean something. The review sample managed a much longer runtime in the Wi-Fi test than ZTE's Axon 7 with the biggest battery: It shut down after 9:34 hours. However, the other comparison devices last at least 1:30 hours longer. HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle is only positioned in the midfield in idle mode. The battery life is comparatively short otherwise.. It is still possible to use the smartphone two days without recharging in practice. However, everyone who uses the smartphone for excessive browsing or gaming will have to recharge it after one day.

In review: HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle. Test model courtesy of HTC Germany.. HTC has actually made some "provocative" decisions for its Desire 10 Lifestyle. These make the smartphone a device that might not be suitable for every user, but it provides a great sound experience for little money.. But first things first: We are in the mid-range and it is therefore not surprising that HTC had to make some compromises in order to incorporate high-end features such as 24-bit hi-res sound into the review sample. The screen is not particularly high resolution and is not very bright. The battery life is only mediocre and the performance rates are clearly below the standard in the price range. The cameras are not convincing and an update to the latest Android version is not expected in view of the outdated technology. Users who value good call quality will have to look elsewhere.. HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle can be described as a good hi-res audio player with smartphone features. Unfortunately, aspects such as performance, cameras, call quality and software are clearly below average.. So, what positive things can be said? HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle offers a quite decent memory configuration, a relatively well-built casing, and the GPS module also does a fairly good job. The input devices are reliable, and then there is, of course, the sound: The speakers are very good and the sound output via the headset is audibly more rounded than in other smartphones.. But is this enough? Likely only for downright audiophiles who do not want to or cannot afford HTC's 10. All others will get a smartphone that presents below average performance in many other aspects and can only really serve with an exciting sound. A genuine hi-res audio player, for example by Sony, costs roughly just as much as HTC's Desire 10 Lifestyle. This fact alone proves that not much was left in the budget for the other features..

HTC banks on your love of beats with its desirable new mid-ranger. We are part of The Trust Project. How much do you care about sound?. If you were too busy getting down to the latest EDM club anthem to answer, HTC's latest mid-ranger might be the phone for you.. The Desire 10 Lifestyle puts sound ahead of everything - well, everything except price. It's a £250 phone that doesn’t quite pack the punch of top-end competitors, but it’s doubled down on speakers and squeezed in a high quality DAC that’ll play nicely with Hi-Res audio files.. Is that enough to look past a basic screen and entry-level performance, though? I’ve been rocking out to one for the past week to find out.. Right out of the box, the Desire 10 Lifestyle divided opinions in the Stuff office - and not just over the ridiculously long name. We just couldn’t decide if it looked good, or if it had edged into tacky territory.. The culprit? The glinting gold trim around the edges of our Polar White review sample.. You could go for Stone Black, Royal Blue or Valentine Lux (whatever that is) instead, but they’ve all got more than their fair share of bling.. There’s an odd mix of matte and glossy polycarbonate plastics on the back and sides, too, but at least the metal frame underneath gives the Lifestyle some heft and rigidity.. Whether you like the look will boil down to personal taste, but either way, there’s no denying the Lifestyle is a bit of a brute. With touch-sensitive buttons below the screen and a speaker above, it feels a lot bigger than its 5.5in screen size suggests.. Despite the oversized dimensions, though, it’s missing a few features that should be par for the course in a 2016 mid-ranger.. Case in point: no fingerprint sensor. Much cheaper phones have managed to pack one in this year, so HTC has missed a trick by not doing the same.. At least it still ticks a few boxes, including the SD card slot. Kinda handy if you plan on filling your phone with massive Hi-res music files. There’s a headphone jack up top (whew) and microUSB charging at the bottom - no USB Type-C here.. The 5.5in LCD panel should be perfect for watching video and gaming on the go, but we wish HTC had splashed out on a 1080p screen.. Instead, the Lifestyle is stuck lingering at 1280x720. Unless you’ve got your nose to the screen, you won’t notice the pixel grid, and it still manages to pack plenty of detail into your pics and videos.. That lower resolution should take away some strain from the CPU and graphics chip when you’re playing games or watching video, too - hopefully giving battery life a bit of a boost.. It won’t rival any phone rocking an OLED screen for colour vibrancy or contrast, but YouTube videos still have a decent amount of punch.. I had no trouble using it in bright sunshine, and it helps make whites look super bright - handy when you’re reading web pages.. The display might only be so-so, but the Lifestyle doesn’t pull any punches in the audio department - whether you’re listening through headphones or the phone’s own speakers.. That’s because it’s packing Boomsound, with a tweeter up top and a woofer at the bottom, separating high and low frequency audio for music closer to your home Hi-Fi than something you’ve just pulled from your pocket. Each speaker has its own dedicated amp, too.. Yep, you really can crank up the volume and listen from the other side of the room - it’s impressively loud. OK, so that “subwoofer” isn’t going to worry the neighbours, but you’ll notice the improvement over most other phones.. HTC has added Dolby Audio, too, dynamically equalising your tunes through the 24-bit DAC. If you’ve got a pair of HTC headphones, it’ll automatically tweak the sound signature to match.. Before you groan at the thought of using the duff pair of bundled buds, though, know that the set you get with the Lifestyle are actually pretty damn good, providing much better audio quality than any other freebie pair.. There's a noticeable crispness to the Lifestyle that I didn't get on other phones, even with the same pair of headphones. Audiophiles might find it too far removed from that must-have neutral sound, but it did a great job adding some bite back into YouTube uploads of old 90s rave tape packs.. The Lifestyle isn’t just a (subjectively) pretty face. It’s also very flexible, with a completely customisable Freestyle interface to make the phone your own.. Everything can be changed: not just wallpapers and ringtones, but icon types, fonts and layouts too. You’re not restricted to HTC’s pre-made themes either. You can download themes made by other users, and even make and upload your own.. Aside from a few wakeup gestures, which open particular apps from sleep mode when you tap or swipe in a particular way, Android Marshmallow is relatively stock too - a big change for HTC.. It’s a shame, then, that it feels a little bit sluggish on account of the entry-level CPU running the show. You’d normally find the quad-core Snapdragon 400 in sub £200 phones, but here it is in a mid-ranger, struggling to keep up.. You either get 2GB or 3GB of RAM (depending if you go for 16GB or 32GB of storage) but even our higher capacity model wasn’t especially rapid. Sure, you can swipe through home screens without any noticeable lag, but intense games like Asphalt 8 feel the pinch and Chome felt sluggish once a few dozen tabs were open.. The low-power CPU didn’t really help extend battery life much, either. You’ll be looking at a drained phone at the end of a long day out of the house, with the Lifestyle regularly running low by home time.. Based on previous experience, I wasn’t expecting to be blown away by the Lifestyle’s rear camera. There’s no laser autofocus like you get on the Desire 10 Pro, and the pixel count is stuck at 13MP rather than 20MP.. It’ll do in a pinch, as long as you feed it enough light. During the day, it takes clear, vibrant outdoor shots, but struggles in direct sunlight and didn’t impress when I moved indoors. Without natural light, pics just looked a little dull and lacking punch.. You only get a basic LED flash, too - no dual-tone fanciness here. That means low-light shots end up looking harsh with the flash, or noisy without.. It can handle 1080p video recording at 30fps, but won’t do 4K. Results are passable for Facebook, but you won’t be shooting any action epics with one of these.. The 5MP selfie camera up front is equally passable, and can digitally pop on some slap with a Live Makeup mode. It can be a bit aggressive, though - tone it down or you’ll end up looking like a mannequin.. HTC’s camera app is annoyingly basic, too. There’s no manual mode, no RAW shooting, no filters to play with or even slow motion video recording.. HDR mode adds a second or two to every photo - just enough to be annoying, and to make you want to disable it altogether. It’s too slow to deal with fast movement, adding blurry parts to your shots as it stitches multiple exposures together, but it does a decent enough job of adding dynamic range to still scenes. If you’re not in a hurry, it’s still worth giving a try.. You’ll either love or hate the Lifestyle’s looks, but HTC’s musically-minded mid-ranger is more than skin deep.. Its high definition audio abilities will keep Spotify addicts happy, and that 5.5in screen should be fine for a box-set binge or gaming marathon too - even if resolution is a bit disappointing for the price. The custom OS isn’t half bad, either.. Performance leaves a lot to be desired, though, as does the camera. If you can stretch to it, the £330 OnePlus 3 is easily the better buy. If your headphones never leave your head, though? This could still just about be one to consider.. The 10 greatest smartphones in the world right now. 13MP rear with f/2.2 lens and LED flash, 5MP rear with f/2.8 lens. HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle review Hi-definition sound isn’t enough to make up for a lacklustre display and pedestrian performance. Customisable Sense UI isn't hateful any more. 720p isn't good enough any more. Where to buy HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle:. htc desire 10 lifestyle dual sim. Where to buy HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle:.

A decir verdad los HTC de estos 2 últimos años no son los de antes, lástima que solo los de gama alta sean un poco decentes... Muchos juegos de playstore que no requieren un gran desempeño NO corren en este movil; para poder ver las fotos del album tarda mucho en cargarlas, la memoria ram se satura muy rapido, el sense en ocasiones resulta muy molesto, creo que se puede conseguir un mejor movil por el mismo precio.. Muy bueno, se han eliminado aplicaciones repetidas. El sonido de boomsound es genial; la cámara principal es muy buena y te ofrece la posibilidad de sacar varias fotos de forma simultánea. La cámara secundaria es bastante decente aunque podría mejorarse.. una maquina de celular excelnte, a mejorar la calidad de imagen en fotografias , solo eso mejorar enfoque y nitidez de camara por lo demas es superbueno. Muy buen teléfono pero no puedo dejar el fondo de pantalla fijo por mas que lo pongo se vuelve a cambiar solo alguien me puede decir como hacer que se quede fijo ?.

What is a hands on review?. HTC looks to have a promising handset on its hands. There's loads of great tech packed into the surprisingly premium polycarbonate body, and as long as the price is kept reasonable it's a phone worth getting excited about.. Release date and price Design and display What's it like to use? Camera Battery Verdict. HTC's duo of new mid-range smartphones aim to bring some flagship style to the middle of the market, and it's the HTC Desire 10 Pro leading the way as the most powerful Desire handset ever, borrowing several features from the HTC 10 .. While its cheaper brother, the Desire 10 Lifestyle, is firmly focused on audio, the Desire 10 Pro is a more well-rounded device, with a punchy octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor, 3GB/4GB of RAM, 32GB/64GB of internal storage, a microSD slot, a fingerprint sensor and the same 20MP rear camera as HTC's 2015 flagship, the HTC One M9 .. Those are solid foundations on which to build, and with an appealing design too the Desire 10 Pro could well make waves – but that depends to a large degree on the price, which is currently unknown.. The HTC Desire 10 Pro will be available to order from November – which means you've got some time to work out if it's a phone you may want – but we've been told it won't be coming to the UK.. As for how much the Desire 10 Pro will set you back, we're still waiting to hear final confirmation from HTC, and this will dictate the potential success of the handset.. What we do know is that the Pro will be more expensive than the Desire 10 Lifestyle – which may mean the Pro could be costlier than we'd like, as the Lifestyle is also marketed in the mid-range.. If the Taiwanese firm can keep the price down to the levels of the OnePlus 3 then the Desire 10 Pro will be an attractive, disruptive presence in the market – but any higher and it could struggle against a number of cheaper, but just as feature-packed, rivals.. The HTC Desire 10 Pro hasn't inherited the premium metal unibody design of the HTC 10, and we feel like we need to get that out of the way ASAP – but not because it's necessarily a bad thing, as the Desire 10 Pro is still a good-looking phone.. At the heart of the 10 Pro is a metal frame, ensuring that it feels sturdy in the hand, but the main body material is soft-touch polycarbonate, which delivers a pleasing level of grip and comfort.. Measuring 156.5 x 76 x 7.86mm, the Desire 10 Pro isn't as tall or as wide as some handsets sporting a 5.5-inch display, but it's still a noticeable presence in the palm, and requires two-handed operation for some tasks. It's not overly heavy though, tipping the scales at 165g.. The phone is available in four colors: Stone Black, Royal Blue (dark blue), Valentine Lux (light blue) and Polar White, with all four options sporting gold trim for a more premium finish – although on the lighter hues this looks a little excessive.. On the back, below the sizable camera sensor, you'll find a fingerprint scanner that provides a secure, easy way to unlock your handset – although we don't like the fact that it can't be reached when the device is lying screen-side-up on our desk.. Still, this is the first time HTC has put a digit reader on a Desire phone, so the fact that it's there at all is a good thing.. And for all those audio fans out there still reeling from the news that Apple has removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus , the good news is that HTC has kept it for the Desire 10 Pro.. The company has even applied its BoomSound enhancement technology to the jack, giving you better audio when listening via headphones, although you won't get those enhancements when using the internal speakers – for that you'll need the Pro's sibling, the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle.. The HTC Desire 10 Pro features a 5.5-inch 1080p display, which is bright and clear – ensuring videos and games look great. Colors aren't quite as vibrant as we've seen on Samsung's Super AMOLED panels, but you're unlikely to have any issues day-to-day.. HTC has packed plenty of power into the Desire 10 Pro, with an octa-core chip at its heart capably supported by either 3GB or 4GB of RAM, depending on whether you opt for the 32GB or 64GB model.. It's unlikely that you'll see both models available in your market, but don't be downhearted if you 'only' get the 3GB/32GB variant, as it will still pack a punch. There's a microSD slot too, allowing you to build on the internal space with cards up to 2TB in size.. Even the lower-spec version of the Desire 10 Pro should be able to handle the latest games and applications from the Play Store, while Google's Android Marshmallow operating system runs smoothly.. The Desire 10 Pro features the same Sense interface overlay as the HTC 10, allowing you to customize your home screens with various themes and stickers for a truly personal touch.. The Desire 10 Pro has the best camera HTC has ever put on a Desire handset – to be precise, it's got the same camera as the HTC One M9.. That means you're looking at a 20MP snapper with an f/2.2 aperture, HDR and two-tone flash. In one respect the 10 Pro even betters the M9's camera, as it adds laser autofocus. This should translate into bright, clear and in-focus shots, and strong performance in low light – although the camera is unlikely to match the snapper on the HTC 10.. During our brief hands-on time with the Desire 10 Pro the camera was quick, and results serviceable – although the device we were using wasn't running final software, so we can expect some fine-tuning between now and when the phone launches in October.. HTC has also redesigned its Pro Mode on the camera – an upgrade not even the HTC 10 has at the moment – with a trio of default settings including Macro and Sports, helping you tweak the various settings in an easier to understand way.. This is great for those still trying to get their heads around white balance, shutter speed and exposure values.. Around the front there's a 13MP camera, which boasts an HDR mode and a selfie panorama mode, allowing you to get even more buddies into your shots – that's a far higher megapixel count than the front snapper on the 5MP HTC 10.. The HTC Desire 10 Pro comes with a 3000mAh non-removable battery, which HTC claims will give you up to eight hours of internet use over Wi-Fi, 11 hours of HD video playback, or up to 53 hours of audio playback.. We fully expect the Desire 10 Pro to last a full day in general usage then, and there's fast charging for when it runs low – but you'll have to wait for our in-depth review to find out for sure if the battery can go the distance.. HTC's Desire range has been a little wayward in the past couple of years, but with the Desire 10 Pro the firm looks to have a promising mid-range phone on its hands.. There's loads of great tech packed into the surprisingly premium polycarbonate body, and as long as HTC can keep the price of the Desire 10 Pro reasonable it's a phone we're really excited about fully reviewing.. What is a hands on review?. 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

First of all, the phone must be bootloader unlocked , if you didn't do that please unlock the bootloader first, you can find many guide for that. And one thing, there is a switch called "OEM Unlock" in developer options menu, make it turn on or you will fail to get unlock token. Now you have a bootloader unlocked device right?. Let phone reboot to bootloader and switch to fastboot mode then use the command to boot the recovery. If you want install TWRP as main recovery please use the command. Okay, If everything are work in right way, your device should be in TWRP recovery, you can do everything you want. I recommend to use Magisk to get root.
