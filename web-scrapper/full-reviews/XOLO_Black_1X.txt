Please do not buy this cheap device, I have ordered it through Snapdeal flash sale and when i saw this device it was not up to the mark, Very Poor quality Camera (not even have 5MP as compared to Samsung), Very poor audio quality, Very cheap display, glass finish ended up after 10 days of use u got lots of scratches in back panel, promised storage is only 25.4 GB.. After using 12 days, on 13th day this device has dead and not switching on, I called Snapdeal Customer care advisors (about 8-9 times) for refund and return each CCA had different opinion and they said me " Sir you need to visit Service center and provide us DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter after that we can process your refund. I went to service center twice and they dint provide me DOA and said just return to Snapdeal, I have ragistered my complaint with Snapdeal on 20th Nov and today is 30th Nov, mobile is still with me and they have not provided any concrete solution, I also e-mailed the concern to Mr. Kunal Bahl and Snapdeal with job-sheet but no reply received till now.. Please beware !!! and don’t waste your money. Never Ever buy anything from Snapdeal.. if Snapdeal is reading this please consider my experience as "total harassment towards a customer"..

Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars A really great phone compared to price. Update: I am gonna have to say that this is the best phone ever. The price was only 7999 when I bought it, it's working like a charm (no issues other than heating) for 2 years now. I dropped the poor phone on the floor a minimum 20 times, still running perfect. The edge areas are broken and the back has a scratch but because I dropped it from quite a height... I mean I am seeing S7's turning into bombs, iPhone X's battery issues, so many problems with other phones, but this one is solid. So many of my friends have changed at least 2 handsets in these 2 years coz they broke when dropped. The camera of this phone is really good, it has front flash as well, has good amount of memory, supports expandable, supports 4g, has a decent speaker, a sleek design! This has made me a lifetime customer of Xolo! Old review(abt 1 year ago): Heats up a lot. hangs if you try to multitast fast. But still worth it for this price. I use a 64 gig sd, and have gotten my ram increased by allocating some of the space from the sdcard. Using it for the past 1.5 years, no major problems yet.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Worst phone. The worst phone I've ever seen. I've purchased 2 nos of Xolo Black 1x for me & my colleague. Both the phones are not showing any display when an incoming call is there. I don't find any service centre here.

Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps.

Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 27.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min).

Xolo Black 1X - Flaunts big guns. Xolo has today launched the second smartphone in its online exclusive Black series, Dubbed as the Xolo Black 1X. The new Xolo phone brandishes 3GB RAM and 32GB expandable storage, which makes it a very enticing smartphone for spec-junkies. The 3GB RAM thing for budget price has been done before. We recently saw Coolpad Note 3 and Intex Cloud Swift beat Xolo in this odd race, so yeah, its understandable if that doesn’t make your jaw drop. Xolo Black 1X however, has plenty more in its arsenal. There is fiber glass on front and rear side and leather finish on top and bottom. The octa core MT66753 chipset clocked at 1.3GHz will do all the heavy lifting and handle 1080 X 1920 pixels rendered on the 5 Inch display. On the rear side there is a 13MP Samsung 3M2 sensor rear sensor with LED flash and PDAF. On the front, there is a 5MP front-facing camera also with LED flash. Other features include 4G LTE/ 3G HSPA+, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and a 2400mAh battery. Xolo Black 1X assimilates marketing glossary pretty well and lays down powerful specs in an attractive package. On paper, there is a lot to like but we would still like to see how well the MT6753 handles the full HD resolution and how harsh it is on the modest 2400 mAh battery. Xolo Black 1X Snapdeal price is 9,999 INR. Since this is an online exclusive product Lowest Price of Xolo Black 1X in India will remain 9,999 INR for at least first few weeks.. 3GB RAM Full HD display 4G LTE Slim and light design.

I have bought this mobile and i faced 4 issues 1) Over Heating:- This phone will get really over heat within a short time period. 2) Very Poor Battery Life: - Battery is very low at least i can't get 1 day battery life when it is in not talking mode and its not removable. 3) Camera : Front Camera was better than Rear Camera, where as mentioned (13 MP Rear Cam.) 4)Not suitable handset for this budget. So, request u kindly "View" this Think and Buy.. I've always been a Xolo fan and follower. This is a master piece for the price they are charging. It's slim, light and looks absolute premium. In fact one of my friends (who always prefer international brands than Indian), after seeing this phone has ordered one for himself. Believe me no issues faced by me so far. After buying the phone an update was waiting for me and it seems to have resolved the heating / battery drain issues being discussed more here. Heating, Low Battery, Poor Cam issues..

Author Srivatsan Sridhar Posted on November 5, 2015 November 14, 2015 Categories Android , Reviews , Xolo. Xolo BLACK 1X smartphone in Black color. Quick start guide, Safety and warranty information. 32GB of internal storage with expansion slot. Hybrid dual SIM might not be useful for everyone. BLACK 1X , the company’s latest smartphone in the BLACK series last week. It is the first Xolo smartphone to come with 3GB of RAM. It also has a 1080p display. and comes with 4G support, similar to most of the smartphones in the similar price range. Is the smartphone worth the price? Let us find out in the complete review.. We unboxed the Xolo BLACK 1X recently, check out the video below.. 5-inch on-cell full lamination display with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels and a pixel density of about 441 PPI is good. It is bright and offers vibrant colors since it has 80% NTSC color gamut. Viewing angles and the sunlight legibility are good too, but the display is a bit glossy and is prone to fingerprints. It also has Asahi Dragon trail Glass protection. You can even use the bundled scratch guard to protect the display.. 144.6mm tall, which is slightly taller than most of the smartphones with a similar 5-inch screen, mainly due to huge bezels. It is 72mm wide, which is good for a phone with a 5-inch screen.. It has a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with LED flash, similar to the first BLACK smartphone. It also has the usual set of proximity and ambient light sensors on the top along with a notification LED that glows in red color. Flash on the front helps to brighten up the images and it even has face detection, but it doesn’t focus properly. It is decent for video chats and selfies.. There are the usual set of menu, home and back keys below the screen on a black bezel. These are not backlit, but offer haptic feedback when pressed.. 7.6mm thick and has a smooth metal frame, but it is prone to scratches easily. The volume rockers and the power buttons are present on the left side.. The micro USB slot is present on the bottom along with loudspeaker grill and a primary microphone. The 3.5mm audio jack is present on the top. It has leather-like finish on the top and bottom that gives it a premium look. Wish it had the same leather finish on the sides too.. It has hybrid SIM / microSD slot on the right side that can be removed using the bundled ejector tool.. The primary slot accepts nano SIM cards and the secondary slot can take a nano SIM or a microSD card. It accepts cards up to 128GB. This might be a disadvantage for some who need both, but the phone comes with 32GB of internal storage, hence it is acceptable.. 13-megapixel camera on the back with single LED flash. The back has fiber glass finish, but it is glossy and is prone to fingerprints. Wish Xolo had bundled a case. 125 grams, which is good compared to other smartphones in the range. It packs a 2400mAh battery under the back cover, which is not removable. Overall the build quality of the smartphone is good.. 13-megapixel rear camera with single LED flash. It has f/2.8 aperture and uses. It also has phase-detection auto-focus (PDAF) that lets you focus in just 0.15 seconds, according to Xolo. It has a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with f/2.2 aperture.. It has a familiar MediaTek camera UI with several modes like Live photo, motion tracking, panorama and multi angle view, different scene modes (Mono, Sepia, Negative, Posterize, Aqua, Blackboard, Whiteboard, Fresh, Movie, Calm, Memory, Gorgeous, Elegant and Cool). It also has gesture capture that captures images when two finger ‘V’ gesture is detected.. Coming to the image quality, daylight images are decent, but it’s not the best. Since it has only f/2.8 aperture it doesn’t focus properly for macro shots. Thanks to PDAF it focuses quickly. HDR images are the best among the other modes that captures every detail in bright colors, but you need to keep the camera steady to prevent ghosting. Low light images are full of noise and doesn’t have any details. Flash helps in capturing images in low lighting conditions and is not overpowering. Overall, the camera is below average compared to other smartphones in the price range.. Check out some camera samples below (click the image to view the full resolution sample).. Check out the complete set of Xolo BLACK 1X camera samples here. It can record videos at 1080p resolution at 30fps. Video quality is good, but it keeps on focusing, spoiling. It also has EIS, which is software stabilization. Audio is not crisp since it lacks a secondary microphone. Check out the full HD sample below.. The Xolo Black 1X runs on Android 5.1 (Lollipop) with its own HIVE Atlas UI on top. At the launch Xolo said it will offer Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) update for the smartphone in future, but it didn’t provide any time frame for the roll out. Only the home and apps section have custom UI with custom icons, otherwise it is almost stock. So you can use any custom launcher, including Google Now launcher. You can launch the camera or dialer right from the lock screen. There is a Underground feature that lets keep your personal apps locked so that these can be accessed only using a secured PIN.. Out of 3GB of RAM, you get 2.92GB of usable RAM, out of which 2.1GB of RAM is free when the default apps are running in the background. Out of 32GB of internal storage you get 24.9GB of usable storage out of the box.. You can also select SD card as the default write disk and also move compatible apps to the SD card once you insert one.. Apart from the usual set of utility apps and Google apps, the smartphone comes pre-loaded with Comet Browser that is powered by Opera, McAfee Security and some security and privacy tools. on the bottom of the apps menu to. arrange the apps in alphabetical order, arrange by the order the app has been installed or arrange by the type of the app. There is also a shortcut to launch Google Play Store easily.. Xolo also lets you choose the apps you want to install during setup. If you select express install during setup, all the apps will be installed automatically, but you can select customize option to choose the apps you want to install or skip if you don’t want any of these. Other companies should follow this instead of filling the phone with bloatware that cannot be uninstalled.. music player has nice UI and plays most audio formats. You can enable equalizer from the settings and use Bass boost and 3D effect features when you are listening using earphones. The FM Radio has default user interface similar to most MediaTek-powered phones, has auto search and audio recording too. Even though the phone has two grills on the bottom, the left one is the actual speaker grill. Since the loudspeaker is present on the bottom, audio doesn’t get muffled if you place the phone on a flat surface. Audio through the speakers is decent, but it could have been better. It doesn’t come with a headset in the box, but audio through third-party headset is decent. It can play 1080p full HD videos smoothly.. It has SIM card manager that lets you select preferred SIM for data, calls and SMS. Both the SIM cards support 4G, including support for both 4G LTE bands (TDD B40 2300MHz and FDD B3 1800MHz) for India, but you can enable 4G on only one SIM, while the other is on 2G. connectivity features include Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.0 with A2DP and GPS. USB on-the-go (OTG) support so that you can connect OTG pen drives easily. We did not face any call drops, but incoming calls did not work occasionally, which could be a software bug. Xolo should look into it and fix it soon.. Coming to the performance, the Octa-Core. 64-bit MediaTek MT6753 processor with eight. ARM Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.3 GHz per core offers good. performance and 3GB of RAM handles multitasking well. It gets slightly heated on intensive gaming or 4G usage. similar to most other smartphones, but it doesn’t get too hot to handle. Check out some benchmark scores below.. It scored 17987 points in the Quadrant Benchmark.. It managed to score 32516 points in the AnTuTu Benchmark 5.. It managed to score 616 points in the Geekbench 3 Single-Core benchmark.. points in the Geekbench 3 Multi-Core benchmark.. It managed to clock 671.1 frames or around 11.18 fps in the. It managed to score 259 frames or around 4.31 fps in the. It managed to score 6847 points in the. 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited GPU benchmark.. Gaming performance was good and graphics was decent too, but it is not the best.. Coming to the battery life, the 2400mAh battery is just average. It lasts for less than a day with mixed use, including 4G usage, video playback, few hours of music, few calls and some gaming with both the SIM cards enabled. You can also use the standby. power saving mode to extend the battery life to a certain extent, since it limits the CPU use when the phone is idle.. In our battery test, the Xolo BLACK 1X. achieved a One Charge rating of 6 hours and 58. talk time, otherwise the battery life is not impressive compared to other smartphones. Check out the complete set of battery life test results here .. At a price tag of Rs. 9,999, the Xolo BLACK 1X is a decent smartphone, but it is not the best compared to other smartphones in the price range. Even though it has a good display and offers good performance along with 3GB of RAM, the camera is below average and the battery life too is average too. When most smartphones come with dedicated SIM slots, Hybrid SIM. might not impress everyone looking for a dual SIM phone. At least this comes with an expansion slot as an. option along with 32GB of internal storage compared to phones with just 16GB of internal storage without expansion slot.. The Xolo BLACK 1X faces a tough competition from. Coolpad Note 3 that also comes with 3GB of RAM. has a fingerprint sensor and also offers better battery life at a cheaper price of. You should also look into other smartphones like the. Meizu M2 Note , Lenovo K3 Note , YU YUREKA Plus. when you are looking to buy a. smartphone in the similar price range. The phone will exclusively be available through flash sale starting from tomorrow on Snapdeal. To summarize, here are the pros and cons of the smartphone..

Brand name of the company that manufactures the device.. the horizontal side of the device when it is used in its standard orientation.. the vertical side of the device when it is used in its standard orientation.. Information about the thickness/depth of the device in different measurement units.. Information about the weight of the device in different measurement units.. Estimated volume of the device, calculated from the dimensions provided by the manufacturer. Applies for devices in the form of a rectangular parallelepiped.. Information about the colors, in which the device is available in the market.. Materials used in the fabrication of the device's body.. Information about the type and size (form factor) of the SIM card used in the device.. Information about the number of SIM cards, supported by the device.. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) was developed to replace the analog cellular network (1G), therefore it is referred to as a 2G mobile network. It has been improved with the addition of General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and later via the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology.. W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) is an air interface used by 3G mobile networks. It is one of the three different UMTS interfaces together with the TD-SCDMA and the TD-CDMA. The standard provides faster data transfer speeds and allows more users to connect to the network simultaneously.. LTE is deemed to be the fourth generation (4G) of mobile communications technology. It has been developed by the 3GPP based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies in order to increase the speed and capacity of wireless data networks. A further development of the technology is called LTE Advanced.. There are several network technologies that enhance the performance of mobile networks mainly by increased data bandwidth. Information about the communication technologies supported by the device and their respective uplink and downlink bandwidth.. Information about the operating system used by the device as well as its version.. Name and version of the user interface (UI) used by the operating system (OS).. The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. Similar to the CPU, the GPU consists of processing units called cores. They handle the computation of graphics in various applications.. The frequency is the clock rate of the graphic processor (GPU), which is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz)..

Chipset is a group of integrated circuits designed to perform one or a more dedicated functions, often with real time computing constraints, Popular smartphones are equipped with more advanced embedded chipsets that can do many different tasks depending on their programming. CPU (Central Processing Unit) mostly known as processors, CPU processes instructions in order to carry out certain functions that make your device operate properly. Processors are often described as the brain of computers, smartphones and tablets, Smartphones and tablets rely on processors to carry out their every task, Processors are an incredibly important factor in selecting any type of computing device, including your smartphone. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a single-chip processor designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display, This includes things such as lighting effects, object transformations, and 3D motion. RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly, any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes that allows information to be stored and accessed quickly from random locations. RAM is the most common type of memory found in computer systems, smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices. Internal Storage is a data storage space (flash memory) mostly used in smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices where operating system, apps, music, photos, videos, files and other user data Is stored. Memory Card Slot is a special slot for inserting a memory card. Memory cards allow you to expand the phone's built-in memory, A memory card (sometimes called a flash memory card or a storage card) is a small storage medium used to store data such as text, pictures, audio, and video, for use on small, portable or remote computing devices such as mobile phones, mp3 players, digital cameras. Sensors are electronic components that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The specific input could be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure and location, The output is generally a signal that is converted to use in computing systems, a location sensor, such as a GPS receiver is able to detect current location of your electronic device.. Yes, up to 128 GB (uses SIM 2 slot). OS => Every computer system run on a base software called Operating System (OS). Operating System controls all basic operations of the computer (such as smartphone, PDAs, tablet computers and other handheld devices). The Operating System allows the user to install and run third party applications (apps), apps are used to add new functionality to the device. UI or user interface of a device is the look and feel of the on-screen menu system. How it works, its color scheme, how it responds to button presses, all of these things are part of the user interface.. Camera is able to capture photographs and usually videos, The most important characteristics of a camera are the resolution (measured in megapixels), lens focus type (fixed or automatic), higher megapixel cameras are known to capture higher quality photos, but not always a good measurement of the photos quality. Display Technology => A number of display technologies and types used in mobile phones => TFT (Thin Film Transistor), IPS (In-Place Switching), OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode), AMOLED (Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode), Super AMOLED (an even advanced version of AMOLED), Resistive Touchscreen (Resistive touchscreens contain two layer of conductive material with a very small gap between them which acts as a resistance), Capacitive Touchsceen (Capacitive touchscreen technology consists of a layer of glass coated with a transparent conductor). Display Colors is refers to the number of different shades of colors that the screen is capable of displaying => 64K colors, 256K colors and 16 million colors, Obviously 16M is highest available range of colors and better than others. Pixel Density (PPI) is refers to the concentration of pixels on a particular display, measured in pixels per inch (ppi). Pixel density is calculated by dividing the diagonal pixel resolution of a display by its diagonal size, higher pixel density better display quality. Display Protection => Gorilla Glass is a special alkali-aluminosilicate glass shield with exceptional damage resistance that helps protect mobile displays from scratches, drops, and bumps of everyday use, It is always better to go for a smartphone with Gorilla Glass for that added protection and peace of mind.. Design Type called form factor refers to a mobile phone's size, shape, and style as well as the layout and position of major components of phone. There are three major form factors seen in mobile phones => bar phones, folding phones and sliding phones. 144.6 x 72 x 7.6 mm.

GPS The Global Positioning System is a satellite-based radio navigation system, GPS permits users to determine their position, velocity and the time 24 hours a day, in all weather, anywhere in the world, In order to locate your position, your device or GPS receiver must have a clear view of the sky. Wireless Charging (Inductive Charging) uses an electromagnetic field to transfer energy between two objects. This is usually done with a charging station. Energy is sent through an inductive coupling to an electrical device, which can then use that energy to charge batteries or run the device.. Battery Type => Cell phones run on various kinds of batteries depending on the manufacturer, phone size or shape and features. There are basically four types of cell phone batteries => Lithium Polymer, Lithium Ion, Nickel Metal Hydride and Nickel Cadmium. Battery Capacity is a measure (typically in Amp-hr) of the charge stored by the battery, and is determined by the mass of active material contained in the battery.

Xolo’s online exclusive smartphone has far too many rough edges, when compared to the more polished rivals. Last Published: Mon, Nov 23 2015. The Xolo Black 1X is available exclusively on Snapdeal. Latest News » NGT tells Delhi, Haryana govts to identify and address sources of pollution in Yamuna De-jargoned: Market correction What a car loan costs you Lowest mutual fund expense ratio: 27 February 2018 The ‘legal representative’ has to file income tax returns that was payable by the deceased. This year, we have seen several smartphone brands follow an exclusive online selling plan for some of their phones. Indian smartphone vendor Xolo chose to come up with a sub-brand, called Black, and the phones under this brand name will be sold exclusively through e-commerce platforms. The Xolo Black 1X ( Rs. 9,999), the latest smartphone to join the portfolio, is available exclusively on Snapdeal.. The Black 1X comes in the black colour option only. This phone weighs 125g and is 7.6mm thick. The back panel has a plastic finish but the side panel is wrapped in solid metal. The glossy finish on the back gives it a shiny appearance but smudges too much and very quickly. The chamfered edges on the frame feel grippy and gives it a slightly premium feel to it.. Its biggest rival will be the Motorola Moto G, which is 11.4mm thick and 155g and feels chunky in comparison. The Asus Zenfone 2 Laser is even bigger and weighs 170g. But like the Moto G, it has been designed well to fit into most hands with ease.. Smooth and at par with rivals. The Xolo Black 1X runs on MediaTek’s MT6783 octa core processor with 3GB of RAM. It is 64-bit processor which means it can utilise the RAM fully. No wonder the device handled multi-tasking, video playback and games like FIFA 15 very well. We did notice slight heating up at the back during gaming. The phone has 32GB of internal storage which is twice what the Moto G and the Zenfone 2 Laser offer. It is expandable to another 128GB, which is another bonus.. Looks dull despite high resolution display. The Black 1X has a screen size of 5 inches and screen resolution of 1920x1080pixels. On paper, that combination works well. However, despite the high resolution, the display looks dull. Text looks bland and colours appeared a bit washed out in videos and images. It handles wide angle viewing and visibilty under sunlight very well though.. In comparison, the Moto G’s display looks more vivid. Even the Asus Zenfone 2 Laser, despite the low resolution (1280 x 720) on the bigger display, looks more colourful than Black 1X.. The device runs Android 5.1 (Lollipop) with Xolo’s own Hive UI, which seems inspired by Yahoo’s Aviate launcher. Xolo has made some changes to the interface. Though the layout is still the same, the interface looks different from the earlier phones. This time around, all the icons are square shaped and that takes some getting used to. The app drawer scrolls downwards and due to the alphabet guide on the left, there is a lot of wide space in between them, which makes the scroll through perhaps a tad too long. This gives it a cluttered look, which makes searching an app marginally slower and more time-consuming.. Needs steady hands and good light. The phone’s 13-megapixel camera is a mixed bag. Though it processes images quickly, one needs to hold it steadily to get good shots out of it. It lacks optical image stabilisation, and that is the reason any vibrations or hand shake blurs the images. The colours looked real but scene detailing is poor. Non-focus areas look blurry and washed out. It struggles with indoor shots, particularly in slightly less light.. The Asus Zenfone 2 laser’s 8-megapixel camera is capable of sharper and more colourful results in similar scenario. The Moto G has a fairly disappointing camera.. The smartphone is powered by a 2,400mAh battery, yet it struggled to give a full day’s backup when used as primary device for web browsing, reading, messaging and watching videos. The Zenfone 2 Laser has a more powerful 3,000mAh battery which gives more than a day with relative ease. Even the Moto G doesn’t struggle to give a day’s battery backup with complete ease..
