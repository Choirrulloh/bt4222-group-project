Gionee M6 Plus - user opinions and reviews. All those asking questions "where can i get the phone in Nigeria". you cant get the phone in Nigeria, except you place an order for the phone from an International distributor or you know anyone traveling to and fro China. The phone was not launched .... You can buy it on Aliexpress but from the user review on Aliexpress, the phone does not have playstore which is disturbing. I also contacted a seller on Aliexpress who told me that the phone has 3.5mm jack output as against what is on this platform.. am from Nigeria, I don't seem to find the m6 plus from our market even Jumia has only the normal m6.

Gionee M6S Plus Review: Data Protection at Hardware Level. 0 23 4 minutes read. Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn StumbleUpon Tumblr Pinterest Reddit VKontakte Odnoklassniki Pocket. 1 hour of video playback reduces the power by 7%;. 1 hour of playing games consumer by 11%;. 1 hour of listening to music online consumed the power by 1% only;. 8 hours of standby mode with no apps running on the background reduced the power by 6%. When BlackBerry was alive no other smartphone maker could compete with it in terms of designing business smartphones. As for now, the situation is completely different. Some brands focus on making handsets for large masses. But only a few of them are thinking on making real business phones. Probably its demand is relatively low, but it doesn’t mean manufacturers should ignore it. Well, seems we have figured it out. So let’s take a closer look at the latest business smartphone launched recently. Today we are going to review the Gionee M6S Plus, an elegant smartphone came to replace the previous model known as the Gionee M6 Plus. As the latter has been known for its good hardware and solid look, the upcoming model should be the way better not to give up its fans. Seems the company could make a handset worthy our appreciation.. The Gionee M6S Plus sports a stylish look, but this feature is not its selling point. Sounds dubious, but as we are dealing with a business smartphone, it’s expected to see innovative security features on it. Running ahead I have to say it comes with a fingerprint encryption technology and live fingerprints. But let’s return to it later.. The phone features a 6-inch Samsung AMOLED screen at a Full HD resolution and covered with a 2.5D arc glass. The corners are not rounded much. The borders have passed high-light diamond trimming process. The back panel is made by passing the diamond double-trimmed process. Thanks to these two processes the Gionee M6S Plus is very comfortable to hold in hands regardless the 6-inch body.. Gionee has decided to bring more functions to the Home button. You can measure heart rate via a regular press. A short press will take you to the homescreen. A longer press will open an interface including search, voice commands, camera, and flashlight. Finally, a double press will enable AliPay feature.. The back of the phone uses a three-stage design with two ribbons on the upper and lower parts made for better antenna signal transmission. Apart of this, the main camera comes with a 12MP lens as well as a dual-tone warm flashlight. The Gionne logo is located below the camera.. The bottom of the phone comes with a symmetrically placed two speakers as well as a mini USB port between them. Surprisingly, the 3.5mm audio jack is placed next to them.. An infrared sensor and a microphone hole are on the top. The volume rocker and the power button are on the right hand side, while the SIM card slot is on the left.. There are two color options for this phone, black and silver. As we are dealing with a phablet, it’s expected to see larger dimensions and heavier weight. The Gionee M6S Plus comes at 163.30 x 80.90 x 8.25mm and 215 grams.. The most significant improvement in terms of hardware is the chip. Unlike the previous-gen phone the Gionee M6S Plus sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 processor paired with an Adreno 510 GPU, 6GB of RAM, and 64GB or 256GB of internal memory. This simply means this enhanced model is capable of running heavy apps as well as play 3D heavy games. I am not saying it can compete with the beasts such as the Xiaomi Mi 6 or the iPhone 7 Plus, but it provides a great performance if comparing to other mid-range handsets.. As for the security options coming our way from the Gionee M6S Plus, there is a special built-in fingerprint encryption chip. Thus, the date in your phone is protected at the hardware level. If you are not good at technology, this means no one can access them remotely.. This is a supper-battery phone that comes with a 6020mAh large capacity polymer lithium battery. It uses a dual-charging chip design featuring QC3.0. It also reduces the temperature during charging making it more secure while the phone is in the process. Plus, the Gionee M6S Plus can charge other devices.. During the battery discharging test the phone showcases the following results:. It turns out the phone will stay alive for 2 days.. This is neither a top brand handset nor a camera phone. So do not expect for it to provide anything surprising. But do not think the manufacturer has ignored this feature at all. It comes with a 1.4um large pixel sensor at 12MP and f/1.9 large aperture supporting dual-core focusing technology. This helps the phone to provide good camera experience and acceptable quality of photos.. As you guess, mainly business people would like to have data encrypted. So the Gionee M6S Plus should come with a corresponding software. Particularly, we can see the Private Space 3.0 pre-installed that allows users to view data only after fingerprint identification. Shortly, if this is not your phone, you won’t be able to view any data.. However, if you don’t want to make all of your data private, you can have a virtual space in your phone, where you can transfer only those data including contacts, dials, photos, videos and so on that you don’t want to be found ever. A person playing with your phone will never know whether there is such a contact, photo or video.. As for payments, this system automatically monitors the financial apps real-time and makes payments via another encryption system. So no malicious program can steal your data and make payments instead of you. The AliPay and WeChat payments are implemented in the same way via fingerprints.. Though many wouldn’t use this option frequently, the Gionee M6S Plus comes with a heart rate recognition function. You only have to put your finger on the Home button for less than a few seconds, and the system will measure your heart rate.. The Gionee M6S Plus is the enhanced variant of the original M6 Plus. Though most of the features are replaced with better hardware, the selling point of this device is the encryption chip that makes your data fully protected at hardware level. Plus, there is a huge battery supporting fast charge technology. It’s good in terms of pricing as well. The 6+64GB variant costs 3499 yuan ($507), while the 6+256GB model is priced at 4299 yuan ($623)..

Mobiles / Gionee Mobile Phones / Gionee M6S Plus Price in India. User Visits: 25 Compare. The Chinese handset maker, Gionee, has been known for manufacturing beautiful devices but is now focusing more upon features and specifications instead of design. The next launch from the brand happens to be Gionee M6S Plus, which the handset maker is expected to pit against the likes of OnePlus 3T. Here is a brief overview of the handset for those who are looking for a phablet in this price range.. 6-inch Super AMOLED display : The handset maker has equipped the front panel of the handset with a massive 6-inch display. This definitely makes for a brilliant multimedia watching experience and gameplay. Moreover, the resolution offered has been pegged at 1920 x 1080 pixels, which means while the pixel resolution might be a bit on a lower side, the display is pretty stunning.. 6020 mAh battery : To have a handset with the largest battery in the market is what most of use want and this handset fulfills that. The brand has equipped the device with a massive 6020 mAh battery under the rear panel. And if you are someone, who is not on their smartphones all the time, you can expect the battery to easily last a day and a half or two. This one feature would definitely appeal to a lot of users.. 6 GB massive RAM : We can expect the handset to perform quite smooth as it comes with the same amount of RAM as OnePlus 3T. 6 GB of RAM will ensure that the device never runs out of memory, even when it is running tons of applications in the background.. Dedicated memory card slot : One of the major con with almost every handset coming out these days is that they all come with Hybrid SIM card slot. However, that is not the case with M6S Plus as it comes with dual SIM slot as well as dedicated memory card slot.. Unimpressive cameras : It seems that while going for the whole big screen and big battery, Gionee decided to skimp on the cameras in this handset. The rear panel of this handset bears a 12 Megapixels snapper, whereas, on the front there is an 8 Megapixels unit. This would definitely be a deal breaker for those rely on their smartphones for photography.. Dated Android : This is the biggest blunder that the brand could have committed since most new smartphones these days are coming with the latest Android out of the box. The Gionee M6S Plus is coming with the dated Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow operating system skinned with Amigo UI.. 32,990 (Expected Price) Gionee M6S Plus is currently not available in any online store..

Gionee has quietly launched a new smartphone in China, called M6S Plus. The smartphone has been launched in two variants — 64GB variant priced at RMB 3,999 (approximately Rs 33,000), and 256GB variant priced at RMB 4,299 (roughly Rs 40,000).

The GIonee M6S Plus, as the name suggests, is the successor to the previously launched Gionee M6 and M6 Plus.

The Gionee M6S Plus flaunts a 6-inch full HD (1080p) AMOLED display topped with 2.5D curved glass. Under the hood is a 1.95GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 octa-core SoC coupled with 6GB of RAM.. Gionee S10 specifications, features leak hint at 13-megapixel dual-rear cameras. At the back is a fingerprint sensor, which doubles up as heart rate tracker and comes with support for secure payment options. In the camera department, the M6S Plus has a 12-megapixel primary camera with LED flash. For selfies, there’s an 8-megapixel front-facing snapper. It is dual-SIM enabled, and runs on Android Marshmallow 6.0 based Amigo3.5 OS. The connectivity suite on the Gionee M6S Plus includes 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, Micro-USB 2.0, USB OTG, 3.5mm headphone jack, and GPS.. Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 Octa-Core 1.95GHz Processor.

The new Gionee M6S Plus is a 6,020 mAh monster of a phone. by Mitja Rutnik April 24, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Gionee has announced a new smartphone called the M6S Plus. One of its biggest features is definitely the large battery with a 6,020 mAh capacity, which should be good for at least two days of use.. The device falls into the phablet category, as it sports a 6-inch AMOLED screen with Full HD resolution. You’ll find Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 653 chipset under the hood as well as 6 GB of RAM. The M6S Plus comes in two storage options. You can get your hands on a 64 GB version of the device or opt for the 256 GB model if you need more space. In case even that’s not enough, you’ll be happy to hear that you can expand the storage for an additional 128 GB with the help of a microSD card.. There’s a 12 MP primary camera with an f/1.9 aperture on the back of the device, while the front-facing selfie snapper has an 8 MP sensor. It ships with Android 6.0 Marshmallow on board with Gionee’s custom user interface on top (Amigo 3.5), which does change the look and feel of the OS quite a bit. The phablet also features a fingerprint scanner located on the back, below the camera.. The Gionee M6S Plus will officially be available from May 2. To get it, you’ll have to fork out 3,499 yuan or $510 for the 64 GB model, while the 256 GB version will set you back 4,299 yuan ($625). Please enter a valid email address.
