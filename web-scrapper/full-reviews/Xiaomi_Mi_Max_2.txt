more ... more .... more ... more .... 2 Interface, Functionality, Camera and Multimedia. 3 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Plamen Dimitrov. Android - Android + Xiaomi - Xiaomi +. 2 Interface, Functionality, Camera and Multimedia. 3 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction For the second year in a row, Chinese phone maker Xiaomi has produced a device that takes the word “phablet” to another level. Much like its predecessor, the recently-released Mi Max 2 employs a massive 6.44-inch screen , but also packs improvements in several key areas. While undoubtedly welcome, these enhancements also come hand in hand with a bigger price tag, so let's put this exotic smartphone under scrutiny and see if it's worthy of your attention. Design As we live in the year of “all-screen” phones, we can't really say that the bezels on the Mi Max 2 are all that slim. Still, the phone works out a good screen-to-body ratio of 74.13%. Compared to the first iteration, there's a big improvement in terms of build quality. This year's model is larger and heavier, but it does feel more premium and comfortable to hold thanks to its all-metal unibody and rounded edges. The power and volume keys feel sturdy and responsive. The fingerprint scanner is fast and reliable, and we're happy to say that Xiaomi has included a type-C USB port this time around. Overall, we like the design of the Mi Max 2, but it's important to remember that a device of this stature is not suitable for everyone. Display The obvious highlight of the Mi Max 2 is its humongous 6.44-inch LCD display. Its 1,080 x 1,920 resolution works out a pixel density of 342ppi, which is not ideal, but sufficient. Viewing angles are good and the screen seems to be a bit less reflective than the original Mi Max, but the maximum brightness level has been reduced for some reason. As such, outdoor visibility isn't a strong point of this display. With a color temperature of 7500K, most colors and shades appear bluer than intended, but we do have to note that the situation is better than with the original Mi Max which had an even colder screen. All in all, we're happy with the display's performance, given the fact that the phone costs about $300.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 review unit provided by our friends at EuDirect.Shop. 6.85 x 3.49 x 0.3 inches. 6.5 x 3.11 x 0.32 inches. 165 x 79 x 8.1 mm. 7.08 x 3.49 x 0.42 inches. 179.83 x 88.57 x 10.7 mm. 6.18 x 3.11 x 0.31 inches. 156.9 x 78.9 x 7.9 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Compare.

Your username describes the essence of review....big size as a con is not valid i think.... the whole purpose of this phone is to have a big size... it's made for that specific purpose... it's like saying iPhone 5se having small size is a con as it may be small for some people.. second the waterproofing con is simply no brainer considering the price of product... and meanwhile Xiaomi has already announced the nougut plans that brings multiwindow so adding a word - not "yet" present would be better idea. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 21 Jul 2017, 08:10. this phone got almost twice battery life compared to iPhone7+. and yet, It can get fully charged 52minutes faster than iPhone7+. (Posts: 671; Member since: 15 Jul 2013). posted on 21 Jul 2017, 11:19. which explains pretty much on why the sales of ip7+ is horrible. (Posts: 2194; Member since: 09 Nov 2015). posted on 20 Jul 2017, 09:50. Now, at first glance, one might said: "What's the bloody point of making such an 'enormous' phone...". And I asked the exact same thing to myself... Allow me to explain, It's meant for people who mostly stay indoors (Geeks & nerds, to be precise). Not as massive as a tablet, yet bigger than a 'regular' 'puny sized' 5.5" phablets to enjoy heavy duty internet surfing, Youtubing and gaming... And since the younger Chinese generation mostly stays indoors and aren't that social, this is a PERFECT solution for them... When they DO go out, it's not that hard for them to lug it around, unlike a bloody full-sized tablet which would be quite a chore in comparison... So, Xiaomi has found a nice, little niche there... To understand Chinese People, you've to THINK like Chinese People...!!!. (Posts: 2194; Member since: 09 Nov 2015). posted on 20 Jul 2017, 09:51. But I do wish that Chinese parents do something about all that 'screen time' and take steps to make their child more social... (Posts: 1; Member since: 06 Sep 2017). posted on 06 Sep 2017, 08:55. And I'm not saying there's no truth to it but certainly not for me. Just a sidenote: I don't really see the point in the large battery if it's for people that don't go outside often. I have a Mi Mix at the moment that has the same screen size. I like playing games while I wait, when I have an appointment or when I don't have anything to do for a short while. Playing games on a smaller screen then this is really bothersome in my opinion. Ideally I'd like a tablet but then I need two devices and a tablet hard to lug around as you mentioned. That's why this is the perfect solution for me. Yes, I know it touches a few points you made but what I mean is, I don't have any problems fitting a phone like this in my pocket and while my hobbies are mostly indoors, I am quite social and take this phone everywhere I go. As said before, if I would stay at home I would rather have a tablet and wouldn't need a big battery either as I'd just keep it plugged in. This battery makes sure I can take this phone with me the whole day and play games without having to recharge.. (Posts: 38; Member since: 16 Aug 2013). posted on 20 Jul 2017, 10:23. This xiaomi has Limited network coverage and a sluggish cpu. Asus Zenfone Ultra 6.8" is far better alternative (supports Band 20 and Band 28 for europe and oceania).. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 21 Jul 2017, 07:57. comparing $260 phone with $700 flagship? lol.... (Posts: 2066; Member since: 23 Jan 2014). posted on 20 Jul 2017, 11:09. This phone would've been more of a catch if they included the S660 which is the obvious successor to the 650/652 in the past Mi Max. Also the lack of western network support isn't really important for phones that aren't officially sold by the manufacturer in the west.. (Posts: 73; Member since: 21 Apr 2015). posted on 20 Jul 2017, 11:20. No SD660 is the reason I didn't purchase this. I did have interest in buying this phablet as I currently have Redmi Note 3 and was looking at Mi Max 2. But will hold off and go with something else now.. (Posts: 461; Member since: 16 Apr 2014). posted on 20 Jul 2017, 11:22. The 660 is a kick ass cpu. Read a review on some Chinese site on a phone having the chip and it easily keeps up with the 835 in benchmarks.. (Posts: 787; Member since: 04 May 2015). posted on 20 Jul 2017, 11:35. Big size can make it unsuitable for many users - Huh? How does this count against it. Big shoes are unsuitable for some users too?. Waterproofing would have been nice - And why would it need waterproofing when it's primarily a multimedia device?. Limited network coverage and support for western markets - Surprise, surprise! It wasn't meant for western markets. But T-Mobile US & UK and AT&T H+ are plenty fast anyway. Video recording can be better - No argument there. Big screen is suitable for multiwindow mode, but feature is not present - It's about to be updated to MIUI 9 which does have multi-window. Most of what you've listed aren't cons. They're tradeoffs when buying an imported phone. It's $270 for the 64gb version with free shipping to the US from most resellers, so you need to check the source of your pricing. It's not a phone for me but it certainly deserves more than a seven.. (Posts: 2066; Member since: 23 Jan 2014). posted on 20 Jul 2017, 11:54. Waterproofing isn't really essential in this price segment. I had to pay a premium for my super media smartphone (S8+). Although I had considered getting this until the S625 rumours came out). Many valid points, that battery score is enough for it to score at least an 8 since it's clearly fulfilled its purpose as a Max device.

I said many times snapdragon 625 is best power efficiency prossecer ever made by Qualcomm , and this mi max 2 has 6.44" inch screen and just 5300mah battery they could easily put 6200mah battery waste of space inside look lenovo p2 with 5.5" inch screen it has 5100mah battery with 177grams.

The Mi Max 2 builds upon the success of its predecessor and represents the best of Xiaomi.. Design Xiaomi Mi Max 2 could be your favourite tab replacement. Xiaomi just launched its latest smartphone dubbed “phablet” in India, the Mi Max 2. The successor to the last year’s product and the subsequent Prime variant that the Chinese company, the Mi Max 2 represents the best of Xiaomi. The company’s portfolio in India boasts of some of the best selling smartphones in the country, which anyway speaks volumes about the brand’s popularity, but also at their attempt to cater to different segments of our society. The Mi Max sold over 3 million units which solidifies the user base even more for people who love a large smartphone. And then the Max 2 builds upon that.. Now, the Mi Max 2 is a bit costlier than its successor but not by much. At Rs 16,999 for the 64GB variant, the Mi Max 2 treads on the line between smartphones and the so-called phablets. We got to test the Matte Black colour variant of the Max 2 and here’s what we found out.. Right from unboxing the smartphone, you get to know that Xiaomi isn’t joking around, obviously through its whole “Big is Back” campaign. The Mi Max 2 is huge. And when I say that, be assured that what is mean is that it lies somewhere between “it's really big” and “holy moly, that’s a big-ass smartphone”.. At 211gms, it’s a bit on the heavier side than its predecessor but it's pretty thin at just 7.6mm. Considering the battery capacity this time around, you have to give it to Xiaomi for achieving that kind of thinness.. As soon as you pick the Max 2, it doesn’t feel like the usual plastic-build smartphone, but in fact oozes high-quality finish. The Max 2 is thin but not too thin, weighs more than the original Max, but not enough. The Max 2 brings around just the right amount of things that work in tandem right from the start.. The metal finish on the rear gives a sturdy in-hand feel. The edges have been curved and rounded, which provides a better grip on the smartphone.. However, that doesn’t diminish the fact that it’s a huge smartphone, but it gives you an inherent feeling of trust that even if it falls off, the damage won’t be catastrophic. More so, because of the metal back, the Max 2 is neatly designed. I especially liked the bit where designers have taken the effort to hide the antenna belt by extending it to the edges of the smartphone.. The rear panel houses a fingerprint sensor along with the camera and flash. The volume rockers and lock button find their way onto the right edge, while the left houses the Hybrid SIM slot. The top houses a 3.5mm jack adjacent to an IR blaster along with a microphone and front-facing camera embedded in the bezels while on the bottom, you’ll find a USB Type-C port in between two speaker grills. The design of Max 2 is seamless, right from the matte finished back which curves on the edges to meet the display.. Next Page Display and camera.

Ketan Pratap , 20 July 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The 6.44-inch display and 5300mAh battery are its biggest highlights. The Mi Max 2 is a great device for watching videos and reading. Gadgets 360 rates the phone 8 out of 10. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 design Xiaomi Mi Max 2 specifications and software Xiaomi Mi Max 2 performance Xiaomi Mi Max 2 camera performance Xiaomi Mi Max 2 battery life. Xiaomi's Mi Max 2 is the company's fourth smartphone launched in India this year after the Redmi Note 4 , Redmi 4A , and Redmi 4. Much like its predecessor, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 bets big on a large display, and a massive battery.. At the Mi Max 2 launch event earlier this week, Xiaomi claimed that it has grown massively in terms of revenue in India compared to same period last year. We can safely assume that these figures more or less reflect the popularity of the low-cost Redmi series. There's no doubt that the Chinese company has seen positive. response to its recent Redmi series launches , but at the same time there hasn't been any buzz around the higher-end Mi series in India. In fact, the company is yet to decide whether the Mi 6 flagship will even launch here. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is the first premium model that this company has launched in over a year, following the Mi Max in June 2016 .. The original Mi Max stood out in the category of phones with screens larger than 6 inches, and now we have a few other choices including the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus ( Review ), at the same price level. Apart from its huge display and big battery, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 offers decent set of specifications. The big question is whether a phone like this is right for you. There have been some significant design changes in the Mi Max 2 compared to the original Mi Max ( Review ), despite the fact that their screens are the same size. The all-metal body of the Mi Max 2 is more appealing and now features rounded edges that make it easier to hold. The 2.5D glass across the front gives it a more premium look, although the metal back is somewhat slippery. The antenna bands are more discreet, blending in with the colour of the back.. The Mi Max 2 is big for any kind of pocket, and we had some trouble carrying it around. We have used many 5.5-inch phones, and it was still hard to adjust to the Mi Max 2. During our time with this device, we found that it easily attracted people's attention just because of its sheer size. Apart from its size, weight is sometimes an issue. At 7.6mm thick, the Mi Max 2 is sleek enough and offers good grip but 211g is a lot for a phone. This is something that might (or might not) bother you.. In our experience, it was uncomfortable to use this phone while walking or trying to juggle other work. We had to be extra cautious while holding it with just one hand during our review period. Typing with just one hand is a tough task, and we advise users not to try unless they are very sure of their grip.. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has backlit capacitive buttons at the front placed just below the display. There's a front-facing camera and sensors above it, accompanied by the earpiece which also doubles up as a loudspeaker. The power and volume buttons are on the right, while the hybrid dual-SIM tray is on the left. The USB Type-C port is on the bottom between two grilles, but we noticed that only one was an actual speaker while the other was just a design element.. an Infrared emitter on the top panel, accompanied by the 3.5mm audio socket. We found that we could reach the fingerprint scanner on the back while holding the phone with just one hand, but we have to point out that people with smaller hands might have trouble with this.. In terms of construction quality, the Mi Max 2 looks solid. Fortunately, the back panel is not a fingerprint magnet, which means you won't need to worry about wiping the phone from time to time. The Mi Max 2 has slimmer screen borders than the original Mi Max, and this means less distraction when watching videos.. Xiaomi has launched the Mi Max 2 only in black, and it looks stunning, but we can expect more colour options to be released over time. Inside the retail box, you get standard set of documentats, a SIM ejector tool, a USB Type-C cable, and a charger, apart from the phone itself. Xiaomi doesn't ship earphones with any of its phones.. The massive 6.44-inch display has a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels, which means a density of 342ppi. It also boasts of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. Xiaomi is marketing the display as one of the best features of the Mi Max 2, but there's also a big 5300mAh battery to talk about. At the India launch event, Xiaomi even bragged that the Mi Max 2's battery can last for up to 31 days with the phone in standby, which is similar to what HMD Global has claimed for the reboot of the legendary feature phone. Nokia 3310 ( Review ).. Under the hood, the Mi Max 2 is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, which has been a popular SoC for phones in this price segment. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( Review ), Moto G5 Plus ( Review ), and Lenovo P2 ( Review ) are some of the models we've tested that are powered by the same SoC. Unlike most Redmi smartphones, only one variant of the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has been launched, and it features 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage.. The phone has a hybrid dual-SIM slot which might disappoint users who want to take advantage of the big screen with lots of movies and TV shows stored on a microSD card. Users have to sacrifice either a second SIM or a microSD card. The Mi Max 2 supports microSD cards of up to 128GB. If you create a Mi account, you'll get 5GB of cloud storage space.. The phone sports a 12-megapixel rear camera with a Sony IMX386 sensor, f/2.2 aperture, and two-tone flash. There's also a 5-megapixel front camera with an f/2.0 aperture.. The Mi Max 2 runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, with Xiaomi's MIUI 8.5 skin on top. This makes it the only phone in the company's portfolio to currently run a stable MIUI ROM based on Nougat. Despite running a modern version of Android, we were slightly disappointed to see some features missing from the Mi Max 2.. We could not double-tap the Overview button to switch between the two most recent apps, and there were no changes to the Settings app or Quick Settings toggles. There was no split-screen multitasking which is a huge waste of the big screen. At launch, the company promised that this feature will be rolling out to the Mi Max 2 with an update very soon, and that it is already in beta. We did try a beta version of MIUI, and it worked flawlessly. In fact, split-screen multitasking was one of our favourite features of the Mi Max 2. We were able to run two apps simultaneously without any issues. The Chinese company is working on Nougat updates for models that are already in the market so we hope that the Mi Max 2 will also receive the full set of features.. MIUI's Quick Ball feature was also very useful as it allowed us to easily access shortcuts from any screen. The Mi Max 2 also has a special UI theme that offers access up to 25 apps or functions directly from the lock screen. You can download the special Mi Max 2 theme from the Themes app that comes preloaded on the phone. The One-Handed Mode came to our rescue a few times. This shrinks the display area to 4-inch, 4.5-inch, or 3.5-inch sizes for easy accessibility. All you have to to to enable this mode is swipe left or right across the capacitive buttons. There are also a few other software features - Reading Mode reduces the display's glare, Second Space lets users differentiate their personal and official accounts, and Dual Apps creates two instances of any app on the same device. The scrolling screenshot feature is also available.. It was no surprise that the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 performed just as well as the Redmi Note 4, thanks to their similar specifications. We used the new Mi Max 2 for a week, and it handled multitasking with ease. Jumping from one app to another was as smooth as it could be. 4GB of RAM is sufficient for most tasks, and we found that there was up to 1.8GB free at any given point. The phone supports 4G with VoLTE, and call quality was decent. The main problem with taking calls was the size of this phone, because it covers most of the user's face, and it becomes tedious to hold over the duration of a long call.. The display is crisp and reproduces colours well. It has decent viewing angles and sunlight legibility. Images and text looked sharp despite the low pixel density. In our opinion, the Mi Max 2 has the best screen in Xiaomi's current India portfolio, considering that the Mi 5 is now over a year old. Graphics-heavy games like Asphalt 8 and Marvel: Contest of Champions ran smoothly. Despite long gaming sessions, we found that the Mi Max 2 didn't get too warm compared to the Redmi Note 4 and Moto G5 Plus.. In our Mi Max review , we had pointed out that stereo speakers would have been great, and it looks like the company has indeed acknowledged that complaint with its successor. The Mi Max 2 uses two speakers to offer stereo sound when used in landscape mode, and it produced some of the loudest sound we've ever heard coming out of a smartphone. There was noticeable distortion at high volume levels, but the Mi Max 2 still outperforms most phones. Audio quality is good through headphones as well.. We noticed that benchmark results were slightly higher than what we have seen from other Snapdragon 625 phones. The Mi Max 2 scored 68,067 in AnTuTu; 29,555 in Quadrant; 9,211 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme; and 27fps in GFXBench. The phone handled 1080p video files as well as FLAC audio files with ease. We had a good time watching TV shows and videos on the Mi Max 2 thanks to the large 6.44-inch screen. In terms of performance, the Mi Max 2 excels compared to phones in its price segment.. The 12-megapixel rear camera uses a Sony IMX386 sensor with 1.25-micron pixels, and has an f/2.2 aperture. It does well enough in daytime but did not impress us in low light. Our sample photos showed very good colour rendition and sharpness under the right lighting conditions. Moreover, PDAF worked well in daylight too. However, in low light situations, the camera was more hit-or-miss. Autofocus was less accurate, colours seemed off, noise was quite apparent, and there was a major loss of detail. The HDR mode does well to improve dynamic range though you won't need it all the time.. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Mi Max 2 camera samples. The Mi Max 2 can record videos at 1080p and 4K quality which is a great feature. Video quality in general was good. The phone also supports time-lapse and slow-motion video modes. The default camera app is identical to the one we saw on the Redmi Note 4, and there are modes and filters that are accessible with one tap. The 5-megapixel front-facing camera takes good selfies, but again the quality fell below average in low light.. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has a large, non-removable 5300mAh battery which the company claims can deliver up to two days of life. In real-world usage, the phone doesn't disappoint with its battery performance as it easily lasted up to two entire days on a single charge, even with heavy usage.. We used the Mi Max 2 for roughly a week, and found that battery performance was good throughout this period. In our standard video loop test, the Mi Max 2 lasted for 23 hours and 30 minutes which is way more than what its predecessor achieved.. The Mi Max 2 also supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 and parallel charging, which are both useful considering the battery size. During our review, it went from zero to 100 percent in around 100 minutes which is impressive.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 in pictures. Verdict We like how Xiaomi has concentrated on things like display quality and battery life rather than other specifications with the Mi Max 2. Many would complain that Snapdragon 625 processor is now dated, but in our opinion, it's good enough for most tasks. 16,999, the Mi Max 2 offers a great package, and is targeted at users that like to watch videos, play games, and read books while on the go. The Mi Max 2 also looks better and is easier to handle than the original Mi Max. For many people, it could offer best features of a phone and a tablet in one device.. The overall design is impressive while performance smooth. Battery performance left us pleasantly surprised. On the other hand, the camera could have used improvement. There haven't been many good launches in the Rs. 15,000-20,000 price band of late, so we would recommend the Mi Max 2 to anyone looking for a great display and battery performance in a smartphone in this segment, if they don't mind its size.. Those looking for alternatives can go for the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus ( Review ), which offers a similar screen, or the Oppo F3 ( Review ), which is a decent package at its price. However, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( Review ) and the Moto G5 Plus ( Review ) are more suitable for those who want a regular-sized phone..

Good Premium looks and solid build quality Battery life is impressive Overall performance is decent Quick charging support Bad Too bulky for any pocket Hybrid dual-SIM slot Camera could have been better.

This phone is available in 32 GB, 64 GB storage variants.. Xiaomi Mi Mix 2: Pros & Cons. Good Stuff Big screen to enjoy videos and games Smooth and lag-free performance Huge battery for uninterrupted. usage Bad Stuff Poor imaging quality Fingerprint reader on an odd location. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 long-term review: A worthy successor However, waxing eloquent on the brilliant design and build quality of Mi Max 2 is moot, considering that I have chronicled the same in another standalone article, so click here to read more about the phone’s design and build quality. Xiaomi continues its winning streak here as well, with the Mi Max 2’s display being perceptibly better than that of its predecessor. The 6.44-inch IPS LCD screen has the same Full HD resolution, giving it the same pixel density of 342ppi. However, that’s where the similarity ends. The display is brighter, with more saturated colours and improved contrast. In short, it’s better in every aspect, but if you wish to delve deeper into why the Mi Max 2’s display easily bests its predecessor, click here to read a more detailed evaluation of the phone’s IPS LCD screen. Unibody aluminium construction, quite durable and shatter resistant 3. Might be too big for some users. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has rather large shoes to fill, because the original Mi Max managed to wow even someone like me who usually hates large form factor phones. However, phablets as they are known are immensely popular in the Indian subcontinent, where people prefer a smartphone that can serve every possible role ranging from a phone to entertainment and media consumption device that has enough juice to last for several days.. The original Mi Max achieved all this while delivering a butter smooth performance in all expected applications and lasting several days on a single battery charge. Everything from the design to nigh perfect optimisation makes it the phone to beat in this segment. It’s for this reason that I decided to use the Mi Max 2 longer and check how the latest avatar of Xiaomi’s cut-price phablet has what it takes to dethrone its overachieving predecessor.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2: Design and Build Quality. If there’s one thing I can’t deny outright, it’s the fact that Xiaomi has done a stellar job on the design, engineering, and aesthetic side of the Mi Max 2. The new phablet is every bit of an improvement over the original Mi Max in every conceivable aspect. While that may sound like a hyperbole, but it just beggars belief how Xiaomi has managed to deliver a true unibody aluminium construction in such a feature-packed phone costing a mere ₹16,000. This is all the more significant when you factor in the brilliant 6.44-inch display, competent Qualcomm SoC, fast fingerprint scanner, and massive 5300mAh battery.. Having said that, the Mi Max 2 proved itself quite durable during the three odd months that I used and, I must admit, abused the phone. I have dropped the phone several times from the bed onto the hard granite flooring and often times from the pocket height as well. The phone, remarkably has been unharmed saved for a few inconspicuous scratches and one tiny dent along two of the corners. And the phone has been dropped enough times to assure me that it’s resilience isn’t some freak coincidence. Full marks to Xiaomi in this department.. On paper, it seems Xiaomi has compromised the camera to fund the improvements elsewhere, with the new rear camera sporting fewer pixels at 12MP as opposed to the 16MP primary camera of the erstwhile model. A higher f stop number also means that the sensor has to work with less light and is potentially slower. The front camera thankfully is unchanged, so there’s neither any improvement nor compromise in that department.. Specifications might give a general idea, but it’s not the final word. The real-world performance is what matters and the Mi Max 2’s camera surprisingly delivers crisper images with an improved colour saturation in bright daylight conditions. The improvement isn’t significant, but it’s evident when you do an A/B comparison of photographs. The focusing in good lighting is fast and the HDR feature works well to highlight the darker areas even when a part of the frame is brightly lit.. Having said that, the 12MP primary camera of the Mi Max 2 pales in comparison to that of the Redmi Note 4. This snapper is noticeably better than the Mi Max 2’s snapper in every conceivable aspect. Most notable of which is lowlight photography. And that’s not a good sign because the Redmi Note 4 itself is strictly average when the ambient light is lacking. The Mi Max 2 loses colour accuracy and introduces noise with night shots, but what’s worse is how focusing takes too long and sometimes the camera just can’t get objects into focus.. While the original Mi Max had these low light issues as well and was actually worse off, Xiaomi still hasn’t made a major improvement and the Mi Max 2 still sucks at low-light photography. Video capture again is acceptable and can go up to 2160p at 30fps – just like the original Mi Max. The camera software continues to be excellent, with great UI and a good selection of filters and modes that make for interesting snaps.. Overall, the camera is a disappointment and bested by the unit found in the company’s own lower priced Redmi Note 4. While the Mi Max 2’s camera is slightly better than that of the original Mi Max, the better performance of the Redmi Note 4 in this department shows that Xiaomi could definitely have improved the Mi Max 2’s camera.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2: Hardware, Connectivity, and Performance. This sentiment of disappointment continues with the performance. On paper itself, the Snapdragon 625 SoC of the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 looks inferior compared to the Snapdragon 650 found in the base version of the original Mi Max. This gives the predecessor a definite edge in the single core performance stakes thanks to the presence of two powerful ARM Cortex-A72 cores, which the Mi Max 2 woefully lacks. However, the newer and more efficient Snapdragon 625 SoC on the Mi Max 2 should give it better multi-core performance and improved battery life.. The last bit is moot because power efficiency was never an issue with the Mi Max or the Mi Max 2 due to their car battery levels of backup. Moreover, in the real world, the multi-core advantage doesn’t hold true because the Mi Max 2 feels decidedly more slower and lag prone than its predecessor. This could be down to optimisation, but I have already spent nearly four months with the phone and there have been many performance-enhancing updates, which have mitigated the performance issues to a fair extent. However, the Mi Max 2 still feels slower and decidedly unoptimised compared to the original Mi Max, which performed flawlessly with nary a lag or stutter.. Both the phones are nigh identical in the connectivity front, with the only difference being that the Mi Max 2 has embraced the times and upgraded to the universal USB Type-C connector. Overall, the performance of the Mi Max 2 leaves a lot to be desired and although it isn’t bad by any stretch of imagination, you still can’t forgive Xiaomi for failing to achieve the same level of polish and optimisation it did with the original Mi Max.. The Mi Max 2 ships with Android 7.1.1 (Nougat) and is now equipped with the latest MIUI 9. This includes the much-awaited split screen mode that makes perfect sense in a phone as large as this one. The newer and better designed notification shade and faster app launch along with more system optimisations also helped mitigate some of the optimisation issues with the Mi Max 2. However, let’s not forget that the original Mi Max never had these performance/optimisation issues to begin with. The support for stickers and better photo editing tools such as the capability to erase elements from the photos is a welcome addition too. The video app too has been overhauled. For more information on the rest of the MIUI features, you can refer to my Xiaomi Mi Max 2 review.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2: Battery Life. The real star of this show is the battery. The massive 5300mAh Li-ion battery is no joke and is only rendered even more ridiculously powerful thanks to the power efficiency of the Snapdragon 625 SoC. The original Mi Max gave me a screen-on time upwards of 10 hours with rigorous usage. With similar punishing battery utilisation involving lots of 4G data usage, web browsing performance heavy websites (serving HTML5 video), substantial gaming and video consumption, and consistent social media app usage, the Mi Max 2 still delivered a whopping 12 hours of screen-on time, with nearly two days of heavy usage until the battery ran out.. Mind you, this is some crazy amount of phone utilisation where I was glued to it almost nonstop. However, with regular usage over the course of nearly four months, I would charge the phone only a couple of times a week. In fact, the enormous battery backup had made me so complacent that I would often forget to recharge the phone until the low battery warning popped up. Even then, the phone would last several hours more and still making it back home for a recharge. Battery backup wise, this is undoubtedly one of the best phones out in the market.. The Mi Max 2 is a brilliant phone. It’s built stronger and with better more expensive materials, with a unibody aluminium design that’s not only modern, but also gorgeous despite its massive heft. The battery life is unparalleled and incredibly an improvement over its already over-performing predecessor. It’s the same story with the display, which is orders of magnitudes better the unit on the original Mi Max. Unfortunately, the phone has its share of issues.. Primary of these issues is the poorly optimised Snapdragon 625 SoC. It simply cannot match the performance and optimisation of the more powerful Snapdragon 650 found on the original Mi Max. If you had asked me a month or two earlier, this would have been a deal breaker. But Xiaomi has mitigated the performance and optimisation issues through regular updates and the optimisation in MIUI 9. The performance situation is much better now, but it still doesn’t match the buttery smoothness of the original Mi Max.. If you can live with that fact, and believe me you can, provided you haven’t used the original Mi Max, the Mi Max 2 still is a solid phone. Not to mention the only great choice in its price segment, where it absolutely decimates the competition with its exacting quality and impressive feature set.. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is the successor to the very popular Xiaomi Mi Max that was released in the year 2016. The Mi Max brought with it a host of unique hardware features, such as a 6.44-inch mammoth display and a beefy 4,850 mAh battery. Now, with the Mi Max 2, the things are even better, as the device comes with improved hardware and software. The device features a fingerprint scanner on the back for quick unlocking and an all-metal body for better aesthetics.. The display size is among the main USP of the device. The 6.44-inch Full HD IPS LCD on the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is the perfect solution for the customers who prefer media on-the-go. The display is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 as well to increase the rigidity and durability against scratches and drops.. The second USP of the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is its long-lasting 5,300 mAh battery, The Xiaomi Mi Max has already proved in our review on Gear by MySmartPrice , that it can provide exceptional battery life which can only be found on a few other smartphone devices with more than 6,000 mAh battery capacity. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 takes the things even further with its more efficient processor and larger battery. Moreover, the battery on the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 features Quick Charging support that can recharge the battery on the smartphone in a jiffy.. A True Powerhouse with Snapdragon 625 Chipset. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 625 SoC powers the Xiaomi Mi Max 2, this new chipset is built on a 14nm process, which, in short means that it will consume less power and provide higher performance. The octa-core chipset features four Kryo cores and four Cortex-A53 cores for a balance between performance and power efficiency. The amount of RAM has also been upped to 4GB in the 64GB storage variant.. Android 7.0 Nougat Out of the Box. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 ships with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The device can fully benefit from the Android’s 7.1.1 Nougat, as it supports multi-window feature that is suitable on the big 6.44-inch display. If you don't know already about multi-window, it's a software feature with which two applications can be used at the same time in the form of a split-screen.. Xiaomi is using an improved primary camera unit for the Mi Max 2. The improved camera has a 12MP resolution with an LED flash and phase-detection autofocus system; it can record 4K videos too. The secondary camera, however, is a basic 5MP unit.. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 uses the USB Type-C port as its wired connectivity option. As for the wireless connectivity, it continues to come with Wi-Fi ac/a/b/g/n, dual-SIM 4G LTE with VoLTE, Bluetooth v4.2, GPS with A-GPS, and an infrared emitter to control electronic appliances..

Please ask the question in above box. Which phone is better between Mi Max 2 and Mi A1?. I am using Max 2 for last one month or more, and I would like to say Max 2 is an excellent phone at a reasonable price, just the size in hand is little big. But it's a very good phone, I must say.. Mi Max 2 is better for the user interphase and battery backup.. Mi A1 is better for its camera.. Does it have a 6GB RAM, 64GB ROM and Android 7.1 OS?. It doesn't have a 6GB RAM, but it comes with 64GB ROM and Android 7.1 OS.. What is the storage limit Google Photos in this phone?. It depends on your Google Drive storage limit. If you select "High Quality (free unlimited storage)" then there is no storage limit for your photos and videos.. For original quality, it's limited to 15GB, but for high quality, it's unlimited. The high quality is also very good.. Yes, it has a dual speakers.. How is the performance of this mobile?. I had purchased it during the Diwali.

Many might be apprehensive of using a 6.44 inch smartphone but wait a minute. Read my review and then decide. I will make it easy for you to decide.. Screen- 6.44 inches, Full HD (1080p), with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. Internal memory- 64 GB (54 GB was free at the time of first boot). Proce ssor- Snapdragon 625, 2.0 Ghz. Sensors- Fingerprint, IR Blaster, Gyro etc. Speakers- Dual- One at top and one at bottom. Camera- 12 MP rear and 5 MP Front. Camera lens- Sony IMX 386 (same as MI6). Android-7.1.1 Nougat, running on MIUI 8.5. If I missed something, you please rectify. Now review: The first and best part is that with 6.44 inches it never feels like one. So, slim and well designed it is, that I am using it quite comfortably since last 2 days. Of course it is hard to believe but it is really very well designed. Despite of 5,300 mAh battery, it is so light that you will be astonished. This is the part for which I decided to go for it. I tested the Snapdragon 625 and it is worth. Combined by 5300 mAh battery, it is gives superb backup. I charged it on 29th July at 12 noon..Till 30th night 11 pm it was still left with 24% charge, that too after 4 to 5 hrs of gaming, continuously using WhatsApp, facebook and watching videos on facebook. And I am using it too much just to see how much power it can give. So, you have a powerful battery that will last for 2 days with heavy usage and 3 days with moderate usage. If you are a completely insane gamer, still it will last for more than one day. Besides you get quick charge facility with this. Charger is quite fast and charges this massive battery of 5300 mAh in just about 2 to 2.5 hours. Camera: Camera is the part on which Xiaomi has worked this time. At daytime it clicks really good pictures. I clicked some photos during day time and it came out very good that was not expected from a Xiaomi device. The shutter is quite fast and sensors are good. So, images come out well detailed. Selfie camera is quite OK...here, it could have been made better. Not the best, still gives good pictures. But altogether front camera is ok. Sensors: It is having all the sensors including IR Blaster. You have to download a VR App, purchase a VR glass and enjoy VR Videos. Screen: Screen is another part where it gives you worth it's price. Sunlight legibility is very good and with 6.44 inches watching videos, movies, gaming is like out of the world. You will not get anything better. Calling: Voice clarity is good all the times and the speaker gives good sound. Also, the signal strength is very good. As it is light and well designed, I didn't feel uncomfortable in holding it to my ears for 29 to 30 minutes of calling. With dual Stereo Speakers you will love to listen songs, watch videos, movies etc. Just add any VR app and you will love to watch big screen videos. It's a very good deal as it gives you all the things in one package at resonable price. Verdict: It has got everything at such price. It's only drawback (if you really believe it is a drawback) is it's screen size. With 6.44 inches it is not that easy to handle in one hand. But believe me Xiaomi has tried and succeeded in making it as easy as possible to use it, by too good design. I am using it and will use it as my primary device. With so many good features, the screen size will not matter much for me. It's up to you to decide. Performance and camera is superior to Redmi Note 4. Of course, it is also having Snapdragon 625 chip but I feel in this device Xiaomi has worked more on software optimisation and given even better performance. Also, Camera sensors are the best in a Xiaomi device till date. So, if you can adjust with big screen, this smartphone or phablet will give you the best performance and functionalities. If you watch lot of videos, movies and game a lot then this is the one for you. Reviewed on MySmartPrice. Report spam 0 0. Xiaomi mobile price list in India. Samsung Galaxy J7 Max price (Rs.

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The Mi Max 2 is a unique device that sits on the intersection of a large smartphone and a portable tablet, and excels at that offering an incredible battery life.. Operating System MIUI 8.5 based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. Display 6.44-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS. Processor 2 GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 625 14nm. Internal Storage 64 GB; expandable with microSD card. Rear Camera 12 MP dual-tone LED Flash. Front Camera 5 MP with 85-degree wide-angle lens. Dimensions 174.1 Ã 88.7 Ã 7.6 mm. Phablets, or smartphones with display sizes larger than 6 inches, can cause quite a divide in opinion. The large form factor is a complete deterrent for most people, yet there is a niche audience for these big smartphones â young people who watch a lot of videos or are gaming enthusiasts, or professionals who enjoy the large real estate while emailing or working on documents and spreadsheets.. Itâs actually quite addictive if you can live with the size â not that the latter is easy. And then thereâs the huge battery life â a natural outcome of the large cell that a huge phone manages to pack in.. After introducing the Mi Max last year, Xiaomi has now launched the Mi Max 2. While it is mostly a progressive iteration of the first generation device, does it make for a compelling phablet and should consumers coming from regular-sized smartphones pick one up? Letâs find out in our review!. For the purpose of this review, I took the Indian variant for a spin. Xiaomi has launched a single variant â in memory configuration as well as color â in the country. For the video review, Bailey Stein has the international variant, in a different color. So, weâve got it all covered.. With a 6.44-inch display, the Mi Max 2 is huge in size and despite what the company wants to assert, itâs not really a comfortable phone to use when youâre walking or juggling around with more than one tasks. Typing with one hand is a tough task, for example, and itâs too big for any kind of pocket.Â. But letâs get it out of the way because thatâs precisely why youâd want to pick this phone up. Itâs a big phone and at that, itâs designed quite well.. For a mid-range smartphone, the Mi Max 2 looks quite nice and the metal chassis gives it a definite premium feel. The construction quality is solid, and the matte black variant looks stunning.Â. At 7.6 mm, itâs also quite slim and itâs remarkable that it packs the big 5,300 mAh battery that it does. Itâs not light (over 200g) but the weight is evenly distributed and it doesnât feel heavy at the top. Also, the rounded edges and sloping back make it easier to hold.. The fingerprint scanner on the back is a tad difficult to reach, especially if you have smaller hands. On most occasions, I had to use two hands to place my index finger on the scanner â not entirely because it was out of reach, but because I was conscious of not dropping the phone due to the awkward lack of grip while extending the finger.. The bottom of the device sports two symmetrical grilles on either side of the USB Type-C port. Thatâs mostly cosmetic because only one of them is an actual speaker.. Overall, the Mi Max 2 is almost similar in size to its predecessor but the design and finish is definitely more refined this time around and more aligned with the Xiaomi design language that we’ve seen recently.. The Mi Max 2 features a Full HD 6.44-inch display which gives it a pixel density 342ppi. A higher resolution on a phone of this size wouldâve been nice, but that wouldâve also required a more powerful processor.. The display offers a decent level of color reproduction, and the contrast is good and it looks vibrant. The brightness levels are just about okay and phone also offers good daylight visibility, but auto-brightness doesnât always work well and I had to resort to manual calibration sometimes.. Unfortunately, the viewing angles are limited, which is a tad disappointing for a smartphone that aims to please video consumers.Â. The Mi Max 2 also boasts of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection, which should help protect the panel against the odd bump and scrape.. The Mi Max 2 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 625 processor, a popular and a capable chipset for smartphones in this price segment. Still, itâs a step down from the Snapdragon 652 found on the original Mi Max, and specs sheet watchers will likely be a tad miffed.. However, combined with the 4 GB RAM it packs in and the balance it aims to strike between raw processing and power consumption, the Mi Max 2 is an able performer. Yes, it is apparent that it is underpowered in outright speed comparisons and benchmark tests, but in real world usage, the performance isnât an issue.Â. The phone chugs along nicely while juggling multiple apps or playing graphic-intensive games. At any point, there was a little less than 2 GB RAM left available out of its 4GB pool, so multitasking isn’t an issue.. The Mi Max 2 packs in a large 5,300 mAh battery which easily gives two days of battery life on a single charge, even if you’re a heavy user like myself. Xiaomi claims 11 hours of non-stop gameplay, and the claim isnât misplaced. I streamed HD movies from Amazon Prime Video continuously for over 12 hours starting at full charge, and still had some juice left when I was done. (Nice Harry Potter marathon, by the way!). The Mi Max 2 also supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 and parallel charging, which is very important for smartphones with this big a battery else it takes annoyingly long to charge fully. Mi Max 2 takes less than two hours to go from zero to 100 percent charge, which is impressive.. Clearly, the focus of the innards on the Mi Max2 is power efficiency and the Snapdragon 625 chipset proves to be a nice workhorse without guzzling into the massive battery. The Mi Max 2 sports a hybrid SIM slot, so you can either use two SIMs or one SIM and one microSD card. A lot of multimedia hoarders who use two SIMs donât usually like this arrangement â more so in a device targeted towards that group – but thereâs a generous 64 GB internal storage and many people will be content with that.. The Mi Max 2 includes an IR blaster so you can control your home appliances using your phone as a remote. It works with a with a variety of appliances and brands. Thereâs also a USB Type-C port this time around, instead of the microUSB on the Mi Max, which is a nice and welcome progression.. Thankfully, the smartphone boasts stereo speakers, which offer quite a loud sound. While one of the speakers is at the bottom, the other one is next to the earpiece. This arrangement is slightly awkward for directional stereo sounds, but not many people will notice it.. The camera on the Mi Max 2 is just about okay. The 12-megapixel rear camera with an f/2.2 aperture manages to capture photos with good color reproduction and contrast in daylight, but the lack of detail is very apparent. The phase detection autofocus mechanism facilitates faster focusing and works quite well in daylight.. In low light though, the camera is a hit-and-miss, and captures average photos. Most photos are noisy, and the lack of sharpness hurts the overall image quality. Thereâs dual LED flash, but it ends up washing out the subject and I didn’t really like using it.Â. The 5-megapixel front camera takes good enough selfies â in daylight, that is. Not so pretty ones in low light.. The video quality is also pretty good and in well-lit conditions, it is remarkable. However, since thereâs no optical image stabilization, most videos tend to be quite shaky, especially since itâs hard to hold a large phone with a steady hand. Thereâs also support for shooting time-lapse and slow-motion videos.. The Mi Max 2 is Xiaomiâs first device to be powered by Android Nougat out of the box. It runs the companyâs proprietary UI layer, MIUI 8.5, based on Android 7.1.1.. While the interface may be considered slightly bloated by some and is often behind on major Android updates, the design will feel very familiar to MIUI fans. Xiaomi has worked hard to offer nifty features and utilities on top of Android to enhance everyday user experience. Thereâs Dual Apps that allows two instances of the same app, so you can open up two conversations in WhatsApp, Second Space which allows users to keep their personal and work setup separate, and a Reading Mode that reduces glare on the display.. A couple of these features are quite important for the phablet actually. Thereâs a one-handed mode that reduces the UI size for a one-handed on-the-move use. And thereâs the Quick Ball which allows shortcuts to your preferred apps by just swiping on one side of the screen.. Despite running the latest Android version, Mi Max 2 doesnât offer split-screen functionality which is really a missed opportunity on a device with large display. However, Xiaomi has announced that the feature will roll out with an update soon, and is already available in beta.. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is really a power bank with some smartphone features thrown in!. The Mi Max 2 is a unique device that sits right on the intersection of a large smartphone and a portable tablet. While a lot of people shrug their shoulders looking at the device, there is a definite market for it, as was evident by the success of Mi Max.. The Mi Max 2 is a nice, progressive iteration of the idea. The refined design and the incredible battery life make for a well-rounded package. The camera is not the best and the processing power isn’t top tier, yet at INR 16,999 ($270) in India, it is a great pick for anyone who wants a phone with a large display or wants a power bank with smartphone features thrown in..

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Almost a year ago, when Google unveiled its first self-designed flagship phone to the world, I was one of the few reviewers who had negative thoughts. My main issue was -- if you read my stuff you already know -- those pointlessly large bezels. I just couldn't get over the bottom chin, which was entirely dead space , with neither a button nor speaker grill. I know Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica. felt the same, but otherwise, most of the tech writing community. gave Google a free pass for whatever reason.. My, how much have things since changed. Last week leaks of the Google Pixel 2 hit the web, showing a device with similar bezels as the first device, and the backlash was immediate. Just check out this tweet by the Verge pointing out the bezels and the responses from fans, or the various other posts by Android blogs. Fellow Forbes contributor Gordon Kelly wrote the Pixel 2 "has serious. I'm no longer in the minority in the Google hardware bashing. The disdain for large bezels has finally hit the mainstream.. So with that mentality firmly in mind, my experience testing the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has been a peculiar one. This isn't even an opinion, but a fact proven by Xiaomi itself, because the Mi Max 2 has the exact same display size (6.4-inch) as the bezel-less Xiaomi Mi Mix, yet the latter is much smaller.. The Xiaomi Mi Mix (left) and the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 (right) both have the exact same 6.4-inch screen.. But, unlike the Google Pixel 2 -- which Google will likely sell at flagship prices -- the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 deserves plenty of. slack, because Xiaomi has clearly made this to be a budget device (in Hong Kong, it can be had for just HK$1,900, which is roughly around US$243). And outside of the dated bezels, the Mi Max 2's build quality is as premium as any other handset out there -- even the US$700 ones from Apple or Google. The Mi Max's metal matte black has a texture that's very pleasing to touch, and the overall shape of the phone, with slight chamfered edges, fits into the palm -- though the phone is simply too wide to securely hold for most people. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is the first device I've accidentally dropped in four years; at least the phone survived with only a slight scratch because of the sturdy build.. The matte black metal looks great.. Xiaomi made the curious decision to lock the left and right capacitive buttons on the bottom bezel. into specific functionality, and the back button being on the right side of the home button really bothered me (I believe the back button should be on the left side of the device). Other Xiaomi devices with similar hard buttons, such as the Mi Note 2 , give you the option to swap the left and right buttons as you see fit. There is a third party app that can reassign the buttons, but it's obviously not as reliable as having the native option to swap buttons.. The back button is on the wrong side of the device, in my opinion.. Being a mid-tier device, the Mi Max 2 runs on a Snapdragon 625 with 4GB of RAM and either 64- or 128GB of storage. actually more than enough for daily use despite looking far outpowered by the 835 chipset in handsets by Samsung and Sony, but Xiaomi's decision to actually downgrade from the 650 from the first Mi Max has left a lot of users scratching their heads.. Nonetheless, the Mi Max 2 performed well in benchmarks , and I used it to edit two eight minute videos (slicing in various clips and doing a voiceover) via the app Power Director without problems other than longer processing times than on an LG G6. The huge battery (5,300 mAh) and Xiaomi's usual aggressive battery optimization makes this a true marathon phone too. It lasted me two full days easily..

Home Features Xiaomi Mi Max 2: Immersive display is one of the best out.... Xiaomi Mi Max 2: Immersive display is one of the best out there. Getting the display settings right is rather unintuitive. There’s minor black crush, but the display excels in white separation. Colour uniformity and gradation is phenomenal. The mobile phone is more than just a means for making telephone calls. The modern smartphone is a personal music player, movie theatre that fits in your hand, and it does most of what your laptop/desktop PC does and that too on the go. The smartphone, therefore, has changed the way we fundamentally interact with the mobile phone. The average person, for example, spent more time with the Nokia 3310 pressed firmly against his head, as opposed to staring at the 84×48 pixel monochrome LCD display. The modern smartphone user, on the other hand, spends an average of anywhere between three to five hours staring at the screen.. In case you haven’t guessed it already, the display is easily the most important aspect of a smartphone and often makes or (literally) breaks the device. This is all the more true for the Xiaomi Mi Max 2. Sporting a massive 6.44-inch screen, the Mi Max 2 clings so tenuously to the definition of smartphone that one needs an alternate term to explain it properly. Known colloquially as a phablet, which is a portmanteau comprising of the words phone and the tablet. Pushing the envelope of a phone and almost reaching into the tablet territory, there’s no doubt that the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is designed for one prime purpose – content consumption, where the sort of person buying the phablet is in the market for a device that can be used to watch movies, read ebooks and comics, play mobile games, run tablet-friendly apps, and comfortably browse the internet.. Thankfully, Xiaomi hasn’t cut any corners in the phone’s display. The device’s enormous 6.44-inch screen incorporates an IPS LCD panel packing a pixel dimensions of 1080×1920 pixels. That makes for a pixel density of approximately 342ppi. Although that might not be at par with flagship smartphones, let’s not forget that Xiaomi sells the Mi Max 2 for a princely sum of ₹17,000. And for that money you’re not only getting acres of display real estate in Full HD glory, but also high-quality all-aluminium construction, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 625 SOC, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, and 5300mAh goliath of a battery. Mind you, these are features that you won’t find in phones costing twice as much, so it beggars belief how Xiaomi managed to magic all these nice things into such a modest budget.. One of the most fundamental aspects deciding picture quality is the display’s ability to get the white point correct. Ensuring that the white point is calibrated to 6500K not only affects the whites, but it is also a fundamental requirement to ensure accurate colour reproduction. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 unit that I received for review had been calibrated to near perfect 6500K, with a bit of bias towards the warmer side. However, setting the correct white point isn’t straightforward with the Mi Max 2 and requires some tinkering in the Colours and Contrast section within display settings. In fact, the process is quite counter-intuitive. Caveat Emptor: Pay Attention to Display Settings. When calibrating displays, the Standard display setting serves as the universal baseline across most displays. All other picture modes, on the other hand, sex up the display parameters such brightness, contrast, and colour saturation to varying degrees. The standard picture mode, therefore, is universally accepted as the baseline mode where the aforementioned display parameters are largely unmolested. However, the Standard preset in the Mi Max 2 is a different beast altogether.. Choosing this preset reduces the contrast ratio and colour saturation to the lowest setting, which makes the picture look washed out and devoid of any life. What’s more, not only does it prevent you from changing the colour temperature, but the Standard mode forces the Warm (lowest) colour temperature setting. In effect, the Standard picture mode is the worst and should be avoided at all costs because it renders the colours flat and devoid of contrast, with an ugly reddish tinge to boot.. At the other end of the spectrum lies the Increased Contrast picture mode, which cranks up the contrast setting to the max and makes the colours appear more saturated. Thankfully, the colour temperature is set closer to the ideal 6500K value, so that isn’t an issue even if you can’t change it to either the Warm or Cool preset. The Automatic Contrast mode, on the other hand, is the only preset that allows you to manually select the colour temperature between Warm, Standard, and Cool presets. This mode also automatically adjusts contrast depending on ambient light conditions. The Automatic Contrast mode lies in an ideal place between the absolutely flat and horrendous Standard and sexed up Increased Contrast modes.. I personally preferred the Automatic Contrast mode, with the colour temperature set at the Standard preset, and I would recommend sticking to the same display settings as well. Xiaomi should ideally have provided a more granular control over contrast and colour saturation, along with a more intuitive display settings menu. Having said that, this is still a stellar IPS LCD panel for the money once you stick to the display settings recommended here. And this was amply evident from the host of objective picture quality tests that my Mi Max review unit had to go through.. Putting the Panel Through the Paces. The panel has a small degree of black crush, as it was evident from the Black Level test. The Mi Max 2 couldn’t distinguish between the first four tints, which isn’t a deal-breaker but it still could translate into a slight bit of lost details in the darkest parts of screen. On the bright side, the IPS LCD panel’s excellent uniformity and gradient performance meant that the remaining tints had no signs of colour impurities or noise. Overall, the Mi Max 2 performed decently considering its price, the small degree of black crush notwithstanding. At the other end of the spectrum, the Mi Max 2 delivered a near-perfect performance in the White Saturation test, by resolving all but the last tint. In layman’s terms, the display is capable of rendering white details with great accuracy.. The Contrast test proved that the level of black crush isn’t all that bad considering how the Mi Max 2 managed to display all but the darkest colour swatches. What’s more impressive was the display’s capability to distinguish between the brightest colour swatches, even for the blue and red ones, which usually tend to be the most difficult. The display uniformity was also flawless across the colour spectrum. The Mi Max 2 performed well beyond expectation in this test. The same holds true for the gradient banding test as well, which benefits from the flawless uniformity of the display.. The viewing angles are are terrific, with next to no colour shift evident even when the display is viewed from extremely wide angles. The gamma, however, is off by a fair bit. On the practical side of things, the colours show a pleasing degree of saturation and tend to pop. The Mi Max 2’s IPS panel is one of the more livelier displays money can buy in this price segment and even well beyond it. The result is a rather fulfilling experience whether you are watching movies or playing video games. A rather decent pixel density of 342ppi allows the Mi Max 2 to render text smoothly and deliver a great deal of detail through the 1080p screen.. However, my biggest gripe with the Mi Max 2’s display is its outdoor legibility. While the display is bright enough to be used under gaudy office lighting conditions, it doesn’t muster up enough brightness to work outdoors under bright daylight. At the end of the day, the Mi Max 2’s Full HD IPS LCD display performs well beyond what can be expected from a phone costing ₹17,000. It’s a vibrant panel, capable of delivering great degree of details at wide viewing angles. Despite minor levels of black crush and slightly skewed gamma, the display goes well and above its duty of serving as the ideal media consumption device.. The only major chink in its armour is its poor outdoor legibility, which is a significant consideration in a mobile phone, which is supposed to be used outdoors. But like they say, beggars can’t be choosers, and let’s not forget that you’re getting a lot of value from a well-specced 6.44-inch phone that’s priced as modestly..

Xiaomi Mi Max 2 review: Bigger is better. With a 6.44-inch display and a massive 5300mAh battery, Xiaomi's latest phablet is the ideal device for consuming multimedia on the go.. Last year's Mi Max was Xiaomi's first attempt at a phone with a screen size over 6 inches. The phone wasn't the company's first phablet, however, with the 5.7-inch Mi Note making its debut back in 2015. While the Mi Note was a flagship device, the Mi Max was targeted at the budget segment and primarily catered to those looking to consume multimedia on the go.. And the plan worked — Xiaomi sold over 3 million units of the Mi Max over the course of the last year. To understand why there's a market for a device that's almost the size of a tablet, you need to know that for millions of Indians, a phone is their primary gateway to the internet. As such, customers tend to prefer a device with a large screen, sort of a portable all-in-one that allows them to watch videos and movies, play games, and read books on the go.. Widespread rollout of 4G with the launch of Jio — which gave away unlimited data to hundreds of millions of customers for free — boosted the country's cellular data consumption, and healthy competition in the budget segment made smartphones affordable. Easy availability of 4G combined with the rollout of video streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video made it possible for consumers to stream videos on the go for the first time, and that ultimately led to more interest in large-screened devices.. Retailing for just ₹16,999 , the Mi Max 2 offers incredible value for money. Does the device have what it takes to be the ideal multimedia phone? Let's find out.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Specs. I (Harish Jonnalagadda) am writing this review after using the Mi Max 2 for two weeks in Hyderabad, India on Jio's 4G network, with usage spread across two devices. The phone picked up a stability update with bug fixes two days into the review period, and is currently running a MIUI 8.5 build based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. It is on the May 01, 2017 security patch. The device is an Indian retail unit provided to Android Central for review by Xiaomi India.. MIUI 8.5 based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. 6.44-inch IPS LCD, 1920x1080 (324 ppi) Gorilla Glass 3. Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 Octa-core 2.0GHz Cortex A53 14nm. 12MP (Sony IMX386), f/2.2 1.25-micron pixels, Dual LED flash 4K @ 30fps/720p @ 120fps video. Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 4.2 NFC, IR blaster. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Hardware. The first-generation Mi Max was utilitarian, and its design reflected that. However, that isn't the case with the Mi Max 2. With 2.5D curved glass at the front and smooth flowing curves round the back, along with a unibody anodized aluminum build, the phone certainly has an upmarket look.. The design is also consistent with other Xiaomi phones launched this year, but the Mi Max 2 isn't just a larger version of the Redmi Note 4. While it has the same finish, particularly in the matte black variant, the antenna bands have been moved to the top and bottom of the phone, giving it a cleaner look at the back. The phone will be sold in a matte black color option in India, which is a smart move by the company as the black version certainly looks much more enticing than the gold model.. The power and volume buttons are located to the right, and the speaker is located at the bottom. There's a secondary speaker tucked into the earpiece that adds to the soundstage, and the configuration is similar to that of the HTC U11. The speaker combination gets sufficiently loud, and it doesn't get distorted at high volumes.. Unlike the Mi 6 , the Mi Max 2 offers a 3.5mm jack, which is located at the top of the phone. Infrared sensors have been a mainstay on Xiaomi phones for several years now, and that hasn't changed with the Mi Max 2, allowing you to control your TV, air conditioner, or set-top box with the phone. There's also a fingerprint sensor located at the back, and its location just beneath the camera sensor makes it easy to access with your index finger when holding the device one-handed. The sensor itself is fast to authenticate, and I haven't had any issues with it. Considering the screen size, however, Pixel -style gestures for bringing down the notification shade would've been great.. Samsung managed to fit a 6.3-inch screen in the form factor of a 5.5-inch phone with the Galaxy S8 Plus , but there's no such bezel-less display on offer with the Mi Max 2. This is a big phone, and you notice it from the moment you switch on the display. The 6.44-inch screen uses an LCD panel, like most Xiaomi phones, and while colors aren't as saturated as what you'd find on AMOLED, there's plenty to like here.. You can hold the Mi Max 2 in one hand, but you're not going to be able to use it one-handed.. The device gets sufficiently bright to be viewable in direct sunlight, colors are accurate, and viewing angles are excellent. You can adjust the contrast levels, and there's also the option to toggle sRGB mode. In short, this is the closest you're going to get to a tablet-style form factor while still retaining the ability to make and receive calls. The large screen is great for viewing video and playing games, and the dual speaker configuration makes it an enjoyable experience.. The curves at the back and the sleek 7.6mm profile make the Mi Max 2 easier to hold, but you're not going to be able to use it one-handed. Thankfully, MIUI allows you to shrink the size of the screen down to a more manageable size — you can choose between 4.5 inches, 4.0, or 3.5 inches.. The Mi Max 2 is powered by the Snapdragon 625 and comes with 4GB of RAM, along with 64GB of storage. The Snapdragon 625 does a good job of crunching through everyday tasks, and while you'll notice the odd stutter in visually demanding games, you won't notice any slowdowns in browsing or when it comes to viewing videos.. While the screen size is the same as last year, Xiaomi managed to cram an even larger 5300mAh battery into the chassis. The battery on the Mi Max 2 is in fact larger than that of the Mi 5000mAh Power Bank, and Xiaomi fit in a screen and the rest of the internal hardware in a chassis that's thinner at 7.6mm (the Mi Power Bank comes in at 9.9mm). The battery combined with the large screen makes for a potent combination, particularly if you're interested in viewing a lot of multimedia content.. Xiaomi touts 18 hours of video playback, 19 hours of reading time, 10 days of music playback, and 9 hours of gaming with the Mi Max 2. That's in line with what I've seen in the two weeks I used the Mi Max 2 — the phone easily lasts two days on a full charge with moderate use, with screen-on time exceeding 10 hours consistently. This is tablet-class territory, and the Mi Max 2 is in fact better than most 7-inch tablets when it comes to battery life. And you won't look as weird taking calls on the Mi Max 2.. The battery life on the Mi Max 2 is nothing short of astounding.. Standby time is similarly excellent, and even if you're one to use cellular data throughout the day, you're not going to notice a sharp decline in battery life. More importantly, the Mi Max 2 offers Quick Charge 3.0 over USB-C, allowing you to charge up to 68% of the battery's capacity in just over an hour, or enough juice to last an entire day.. As always, you can always maximize battery life by limiting background apps, and MIUI will give you suggestions based on your usage patterns to eke out the most out of the 5300mAh battery. That said, unless you're streaming video throughout the day or gaming non-stop for over eight hours, you're not going to run out of battery on the Mi Max 2 any time soon. Finally, Xiaomi noted at the launch event that the Mi Max 2 beat out the Nokia 3310 when it comes to battery life.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Software. Like the Mi 6, the Mi Max 2 is running the latest build of MIUI 8.5 based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. The update is slated to roll out to Xiaomi's older devices shortly, but it's great that the Mi Max 2 is running Nougat out of the box.. While it's great that the Mi Max 2 comes with Nougat, the experience hasn't changed all that much from Marshmallow. For instance, there's no way to restore apps from your Google account when setting up the device, with Xiaomi instead relying on its own Mi Cloud service. If you've used a Xiaomi device in the past, you'll be able to restore content and settings stored in the Mi Cloud onto the Mi Max 2. You do get the option to choose between Swiftkey or Gboard when setting up the phone.. The Mi Max 2 is the first Xiaomi phone in India to run Nougat out of the box.. However, you do still get all the usual bells and whistles — you can run two apps simultaneously, there's a built-in video editor in the gallery, and you get an audio recorder as well as a QR reader. You can also take scrolling screenshots, and use a three-finger gesture to take a screenshot, much like OxygenOS. Quick ball also comes in handy, allowing you to launch apps with ease.. MIUI has thousands of themes that let you customize every facet of the interface, and with the Mi Max 2 Xiaomi is rolling out a new theme that gives you an enhanced version of Quick ball through which you can launch up to 21 apps directly from the lock screen. The phone also has a multi-window mode that allows you to maximize its screen real estate. It differs slightly from the way multi-window works on "pure" Android, but you will be able to run two apps simultaneously on your device.. Then there's a blue light filter, which prevents strain on your eyes when viewing the screen at night. The feature is dubbed Reading mode, but unlike what you get on the OnePlus 5 , it doesn't turn the screen monochrome — it alters the color temperature of the display to warmer hues. Given the screen size of the Mi Max 2, it would've been ideal had the device offered a similar monochrome mode for reading text.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Camera. The Mi Max 2 uses the same primary camera sensor as the Mi 6 (Sony's IMX 386). Xiaomi used different imaging sensors in each of its devices last year, which led to vastly varying results. This time around, the brand is reusing sensors to make the camera quality consistent across devices in the same segment.. That said, there's no OIS in the Mi Max 2. The phone takes detailed images in daylight conditions, and Auto HDR makes a noticeable difference. However, shots in low light or artificial lighting conditions have a lot of noise. Furthermore, the phone takes a few seconds to process images, so you won't be able to take a series of shots in a hurry.. The camera in the Mi Max 2 is a definite step up from the first-gen model, but the performance in low-light conditions isn't quite there with the likes of the Mi 6.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Bottom line. Xiaomi has managed to carve out a niche for itself with the first-gen Mi Max, and with the Mi Max 2, the brand has refined its model for the ultimate phablet. The all-metal anodized aluminum chassis gives the phone a premium feel, and the 5300mAh battery fundamentally changes the way you use your phone.. Xiaomi launched four devices in the country this year — the budget Redmi Note 4, the entry-level Redmi 4A, the Redmi 4, and now the Mi Max 2. What's consistent across all four models is great battery life, but the Mi Max 2 takes things to a whole new level.. What's also consistent across all of Xiaomi's 2017 models is the aggressive pricing. Launching for just ₹16,999 and offering 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage, the Mi Max 2 definitely punches above its weight. There's no mention of when the Mi 6 will make its debut in India, but Xiaomi has effectively sown up the budget segment with the launch of the Mi Max 2, offering a selection of devices that cater to different market needs.. If you're interested in picking up the Mi Max 2 outside of India, you'll have to resort to sites like GearBest, where the device is available for $249.. Update: Updated in August 2017 with links to Amazon India and additional details on multi-window mode, which is now available.. Harish Jonnalagadda is the Regional Editor at Android Central.

Xiaomi Mi Max 2 review: you need this if you're a fan of multimedia. Xiaomi Mi 6 vs Samsung Galaxy S8. Xiaomi Mi Max, Xiaomi has introduced its 2017 successor, which is modestly called the Mi Max 2. its prominent size of 6.44 inches. What’s new on this year's phablet? Read on to find out.. ✕ Software interface not great for playing around with. ✕ No 800 MHz for 4G. ✕ Too big for some pockets. Lowest price: Xiaomi Mi Max 2. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 release date and price. Lowest price: Xiaomi Mi Max 2. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 was presented in May, and went on sale on June 1. As usual with Xiaomi, you can't buy the smartphone directly from the manufacturer in the US - you can only get it by going through a retailer who will buy it in from China. Two models are available: the first offers 64GB of internal memory and the second comes with 128GB, with the RAM in both cases being 4GB. The real difficulty (at least for those who aren’t used to it) is finding a model with an international ROM and not a Chinese one. Luckily, some retailers will sort this out for you. With regards to the price, it varies from one retailer to the next but, on the whole, you’ll find the 64GB model for around $300. GearBest is currently offering a promotion on this device (for the international version): you can get the 128GB model for $388.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 design and build quality. A simple line on the top and bottom of the Xiaomi Mi Max 2.© AndroidPIT. Dual SIM or SIM + SD card, the choice is yours.. The fingerprint scanner is fast on the Xiaomi Mi Max 2.. Forget about using it with one hand, it’s absolutely impossible. While some manufacturers focus on making the packaging as attractive as possible, when it comes to the box, Xiaomi keeps it particularly simple. No huge box with a multitude of accessories, but a simple box in which you’ll find the smartphone and, beneath it, a Type-C USB charging cable and a charger. I must point out that the model I received for this review was the Chinese version. On the whole, I found a few similarities between the design of the first Xiaomi Mi Max and this newer. Visually speaking, with the screen turned off, everything looks the same. On the back, Xiaomi got rid of the big borders that. outlined the smartphone on the top and bottom in order to guarantee antenna. function: on this new model, the top and bottom borders are just a simple line, which gives the smartphone a chic look. On the top, the dual flash is now on the left of the camera lens instead of on. As for the rest, there aren’t many differences.. Even the color is the same. It falls under the name ‘Champagne’ (which also gives it a premium feel) although, in reality, it looks more like what is called ‘Gold’ by competitors. It's made of aluminum and is visually attractive and pleasant to the touch but it’s less elegant than what is offered by the competition (for example, the Honor 8 , which is in a similar price range). A small criticism about the Mi Max 2: the notifications LED doesn’t flash white, which is a shame but. Of course, as with most smartphones these days, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has a fingerprint scanner. Despite its size, it’s easily accessible on the back of the device. It’s extremely fast and doesn't encounter any problems when it comes to reading fingerprints. it can be used as a camera button when you want to take a photo.. The most interesting thing about this device isn’t the material or the finish, it’s the unusual size. Measuring 174.1mm in length and 88.7mm in width, this device is huge. If you want to travel with it, think about storing it in a backpack, a briefcase or a handbag because the smartphone won’t fit in your trouser. If you like to wear tight trousers or if you’re small, the size will be a problem for you. Large in size means heavy in weight, and this Mi Max 2 is 8 grams heavier than its predecessor, which brings it to a weight of 211 grams. It’s not that bad when you hold it however, if you’ve just held a featherweight smartphone, you’ll notice the difference.. Forget about using it with one hand, it’s absolutely impossible. I personally had many problems when using it. The size isn’t an issue when using it at home but, when you’re out, it’s a little more complicated: when you’re on the subway, when you’re taking a photo, when you want to take it out of your pocket for any reason… If you have small hands, it’s a nightmare. In several situations, I found it impossible to have such a large smartphone. Of course, its large size also has its advantages, we’ll come back to that later on.. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 isn't perfectly borderless but the borders are thin.. As for the screen, Xiaomi hasn’t made any great changes in terms of materials used. It has used an IPS LCD screen again, kept the 6.44-inch size and the same Full-HD (1080 x 1920 pixels) definition, like its predecessor. The pixel density also remains 342 pixels per inch. As for the left and right borders, they are visible but are relatively thin.. The screen protection is, again, Gorilla Glass 4: while it can protect against impacts and scratches, this protective screen won’t help if the device falls from too high a height or if the smartphone is dropped (for example, onto a stone). This protective layer isn’t a magic wand that will solve all your problems. if you wish to do so, you can opt for warmer or cooler colors in the settings. You can also modify the contrast, there are three options available to you. A reading mode is also available to make for more comfortable reading on your device.. In summary, the screen is quite good but, when in strong sunlight, it doesn’t make for comfortable reading because the visibility is reduced.. The security patch from May 2017. If you don’t activate your apps in autosart, they won’t work correctly.. The swiss army knife of applications. Our test model uses MIUI 8.5.12.0, an in-house interface based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. The security patch version for the device is the one from May 2017. With the Xiaomi smartphones not being officially introduced in the US by the manufacturer, you have to go to a retailer to buy one. You should pay attention to the choice of ROM and opt for an international ROM so you’ll be able to find your language and, with a little luck, the retailer will even install Google services for you.. Our test model had a Chinese ROM and the Play Store wasn’t featured, of course. While installation was easy when you know how to do it, a more clueless user would be completely lost. In short, if you want to install the Play Store , the easiest way is the download the file in this tutorial , then local installation via the recovery system. If you have a Chinese ROM, you can install an international ROM, which is available on the MIUI website. The Xiaomi interface is very different to those on competitors' devices. Of course, it’s another world in terms of graphics, but several software elements are worth highlighting. Firstly, Xiaomi’s application manager is unusual. For example, for WhatsApp, you have to go into the Security application then into Permissions. After that, you have to activate WhatsApp in Autostart so that it’s launched automatically. Then you have to agree to the necessary permissions by going into Permissions. After that, you have to activate notifications and configure them, for example, so that they appear on a screen that's been turned off. In short, it’s commonplace for the familiar, an oddity for others.. This Security application allows you to carry out other actions, such as cleaning out your cache data or even finding out which applications consume the most data.. 3D Mark Sling Shot Extrme ES 3.1. 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.0. 3D Mark Ice Storm Unlimited ES 2.0. This Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has a Snapdragon 625 processor. This is a mid-range 14nm processor, which allows for a greatly reduced energy consumption compared to the previous model, which had a Snapdragon 650 28nm processor. If you want to read more into the technical details of this processor, please consult the Qualcomm website on this subject.. It is combined with an Adreno 506 graphics chip and 4GB of RAM. On the whole, it’s a fluid experience and I didn’t encounter any application crashes, but what interested me the most about this smartphone was the multimedia. With the large screen, I expected a great experience for games and videos, and this was definitely the case because it’s a real pleasure to use. was the installation of certain games which, because of a problem with Google Services, didn’t want to launch.. The X9 modem offers excellent performances but, unfortunately, band 20 isn’t supported. If your operator uses an 800MHz frequency for 4G, it would be better to opt for another model. Of course, if 4G isn’t important to you and you are happy enough with 3G, you won’t have any problems.. Only the right side produces sound on the Xiaomi Mi Max 2.. This smartphone is essentially destined for multimedia usage thanks to its large size. Multimedia also means sound, and the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 copes rather well in this area. The big surprise is that it has stereo sound: one of the loud-speakers is located on the bottom of the device, to the right of the type-C USB port, the other is situated at the top of the device on the frontal loud-speaker. As is often the case, the ports situated on the bottom are only there for symmetry.. The sound quality is also excellent as it is particularly clear and the volume can range from very low to very high, unlike certain smartphones where the minimum volume is too loud or the maximum volume is too low. The sound quality is also excellent when using headphones. With regards to communication, the quality is excellent and you won’t have any problem making yourself understood or understanding your correspondent.. See all images taken with the Xiaomi Mi Max 2. The camera is located on the top left of the Xiaomi Mi Max 2, with a dual LED flash.. To the left, distortion mode on the Xiaomi Mi Max 2. To the right, the mosaic mode.. at first glance, you might think that the smartphone is focused on video and gaming experience, you’ll be (pleasantly) surprised by Xiaomi’s strategy: it hasn’t sacrificed photo quality, it offers something excellent for this price range.. This Mi Max 2 has a Sony lens (IMX386 to be precise) on the back. It measures 1/2.9 inches and takes photos in 12MP. In fact, it’s the same lens that is used in the Xiaomi Mi 6. It is combined with a f/2.2 aperture and a dual LED flash. On paper, it’s quite odd but, in practice, the results are pretty good.. Various modes are available, allowing you to apply different filters, for example, to give your image a specific effect. Personally, I’m not interested in these modes but photo enthusiasts on social media will know how to make the most of them. In a similar manner, the camera app offers you a little more with facial recognition: it tries to guess the age and gender of the person. Of course, this can be deactivated in the options.. Of course, a manual mode is available, which allows you to regulate the white balance, exposure time, focus and ISO. here is our photography expert, Stefan's impressions of the smartphone. In good lighting, this Mi Max 2 takes excellent photos with. colors that stay true to reality. The white balance produces good results, even in poor lighting conditions. The smartphone also does a great job in terms of exposure. As with most smartphones, the dynamic range poses a problem. The auto HDR mode is far from rivaling that of the Google Pixel or the Samsung Galaxy S8. photos rich in contrast appear as. On the other hand, HDR images are rather natural. In poor lighting conditions, the Mi Max 2 isn’t bad. At ISO 1250, the images are rather vibrant and display good colors. The limit is ISO 6400, but even this isn’t that terrible. The Mi Max 2 manages to keep the chrominance noise and the lighting by preserving the colors and details. I think that the main camera on the Mi Max 2 offers a great balance between ISO low sensitivity and quick shutter speed. The slowest shutter speed that the Mi Max 2 dares to use is 1/17 seconds. An optical image stabilizer would have been useful, allowing for a longer duration, but we don’t have one here. On the front, this 5MP lens is grainy, even in good lighting conditions. The device doesn’t prioritize faces, which can lead to problems with under-exposure when there’s a lot of contrast. Generally speaking, the Mi Max 2 isn’t able to rival the big names in the field, but that’s not surprising. With that said, the differences aren’t as huge as you would imagine if you take the price into account, which is over $300.. To the left, the app configuration menu to save energy on the Xiaomi Mi Max 2. To the right, the energy saving mode.. The battery capacity has increased compared to its predecessor, it’s now 5300 mAh. The device needs a lot of resources to be able to power the large screen and the results are very satisfying. Of course, it’s not just the battery, the software optimization and consumption thanks to the Snapdragon 625 also play an important role.. Even with intense usage, the battery copes well and can last a full day. By intense usage, I mean regular use of the screen to watch videos, chat on WhatsApp, read articles online and, of course, communicating, whether it be through WhatsApp or via phone call. In the benchmark tests, the device obtained a good score of 13h30 with the SIM card removed but Wi-Fi turned on, processes running in the background and brightness set to mid-range. Of course, benchmarks don’t really mean much because everyone has different uses (and some cheat them), but this can give. you an idea of the device’s potential battery capacity.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 technical specifications. 174.1 x 88.7 x 7.6 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (342 ppi). HSPA, LTE, Dual-SIM , Bluetooth 4.2. If you’re not scared off by a large smartphone and the inconveniences that come along with it (the difficulty of fitting it in your pocket, hard to use if your hands are small, etc.), you’ll love this device, which is specifically optimized for multimedia. The huge 6.44-inch screen allows you to enjoy video and game content and the stereo sound guarantees a great sound experience. Of course, it’s not all rosy in the garden. The smartphone isn’t officially available, so you have to turn to a retailer to get your hands on one, which can scare off some people. Google services won’t be installed by default and I must admit, when you’re used to having it there, it’s hard to go without. As for MIUI, you’ll need an adjustment period if you’re used to stock Android. All things considered, for a price of around $300, multimedia amateurs will love this great new toy.. There is a big mistake on your review about headphone sound quality. The headphone sound quality is really very bad comparing to other xiaomi evices.. Hi Anand, reviews are always on one device, the one we are able to test here in the office. Benoit did not notice any issues with the sound quality. Have you tried multiple versions of the phone? It is possible that it is an issue that only your phone is experiencing.. Sorry but Does anyone have link to the wallpaper of the bird in the first image ?. Thanks for a great review like always.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 128 GB + MicroSD. Release date: Jun 1, 2017. View all photos (49). Click to read the full review. Very big display (6.4 inches). Lots of RAM (4 GB RAM). The Mi Max 2 is boasting the very same run-of-the-mill design that makes up most of Xiaomi's affordable portfolio. Metal body, three capacitive navigation keys in the front, a round fingerprint scanner at the back and rounded edges. Carrying a huge 6.44" display at the front and a hefty 5,300mAh battery at the back, the Mi Max 2 is powered by one of Qualcomm's best recent chipsets - the Snapdragon 625.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Review Xiaomi Mi Max 2 benchmarks. Dimensions: 6.85 x 3.49 x 0.30 inches (174.1 x 88.7 x 7.6). Weight: 7.44 oz (211 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Features: Fingerprint (touch), Touch sensitive control keys. Display Physical size: 6.4 inches. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 4), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. 3840x2160 (4K) (30 fps), 1920x1080 (1080p HD), 1280x720 (720p HD) (120 fps). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 14 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 57.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better!

Second, watching videos on big-screen phones can’t be compared with the same experience on smaller handsets. Third, they are great when viewing (and/or working on) documents such as Word, Excel, PPT, PDF, etc. The original Xiaomi Mi Max was launched more than a year ago. It was a good phone, but not a legend like the Xiaomi Mi 5. So many customers have already managed to forget about it. That’s why when the conversations about a new big-size phone from Xiaomi have started buzzing the net, many didn’t take it seriously. However, Xiaomi has proved for many times it is the best brand when it comes to price-hardware ratio. This simply means the second-gen Xiaomi Mi Max 2 should come with a list of improvements and cost less than many phones from the same niche. The phone has been unleashed on May 25 , and we have already got our hands on it. So let’s take a closer look at the latest monster-sized phone of Chinese Apple. Meet the Xiaomi Mi Max 2.. Check out XIaomi Mi Max 2 deal. We know a few years back the best screen size for smartphones has been considered to be 4.7 inches. Then 5-inch handsets were called gold-size handsets. Now seems the diagonal of a smartphone screen should be the way bigger. Nothing prevents us to own a 6-inch phone and operate on it like nothing’s wrong. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2, as the name suggests, comes with a large screen at 6.44 inches.. In comparison to the previous model, this one doesn’t differ much in terms of display. But the black borders around it has become narrower by 53%. This shouldn’t cause any surprise, because we know even low-end smartphones of Xiaomi come with narrower frames. Just recall the Xiaomi Redmi 4 that has got such an improvement recently, though no one complained on the existing width of the borders. The screen comes at a resolution of 1080P and 72% NTSC color gamut. Theoretically, the Mi Max 2 screen shouldn’t provide outstanding viewing performance. But do not forget we are dealing with a Xiaomi handset. Moreover, it belongs to Mi family. This means everything should be at the highest level in this phone. So when interacting with the Xiaomi Mi Max 2, we have a feeling as it’s a high-end device with the best display.. This screen also comes with a few useful features such as eye protection mode as well as color temperature adjustment. Moreover, it will get an OTA update soon allowing you use the split-screen feature. I guess this will work fine on a big-screen smartphone.. Though big-screen phones are not recommended to girls due to smaller palm, most of owners of such devices are females. As for the Xiaomi Mi Max 2, you don’t have to worry about anything – there is a special ‘small screen mode’ as well as ‘floating ball’ for better single-hand operations.. So what we can say about advantages of big screen phones ?. But it has a ‘disadvantage’ as well – portability. Many think it is uncomfortable to put in a pocket. I agree, but look at this.. At last, you should know the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is the way bigger than the iPhone 7 Plus.. The back of the phone differs from the previous model. Now the manufacturer uses a metal unibody design and has removed the ‘box’ part. This affects not only the look of the phone, but also durability. The technology used for making one-piece housings allows manufacturers to make more solid handsets, but the antenna signal can be affected. So Xiaomi uses a U-type antenna design for better transmission.. Like the original device the Xiaomi Mi Max 2’s camera is placed on the upper left area. But the flash light position has been changed. The fingerprint scanner is where it has been.. The front camera, proximity sensor and a front speaker are above the screen placed symmetrically for better look.. The volume rocker and the power button are on the right side.. The SIM card slot is on the left.. The infrared hole, noise reduction microphone, and 3.5mm audio jack are on the top.. The USB Type-C port paired with two speakers are on the bottom.. So we can write down that though the overall look of the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has not been changed much, the body making process has been improved a lot.. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 can’t be considered as a high-end smartphone, because we know what astonishing features they come with. But this phone is still packed with decent specs. It sports a Snapdragon 625 processor paired with a 4GB of RAM and 64/128GB of internal memory. Many think this chip and memory configuration are not sufficient to play heavy games on its big screen. If looking at the specs list only and not try it out, no one can say what this device is capable of.. So we decided to test it by playing the much-popular ‘King of Glory’, ‘CrossFire’ and ‘2K17’. As a result, we can see the phone runs the game at 30fps and no out-of-frame situation appears. When the game is played on multi-player mode, the screen is between 28-30fps as well. So be sure, there is no problem with the Mi Max 2 when playing heavy games.. Now when we have got it worked out with playing games on the. Xiaomi Mi Max 2, let’s take a quick look at the benchmarks.. ‘Big screen power’ is Xiaomi Mi Max 2’s slogan. Probably, these are the three words that can describe this handset the best. It comes with a big body and large screen. The former one allows the manufacturer to put a large battery inside the phone that should serve to the latter. The 5300mAh battery should be enough for daily use. We have tested it for a few times. First, the screen’s brightness was set at 50%. Say, we were running WeChat, playing King of Glory, watching videos, shooting, browsing web pages and so on. As a result, the phone lasted for 1 day and 9 hours (from 13:53 to 23:15 of the next day). The remaining power was 2% at the end of the test. So we can state, if you use it less, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is capable of lasting up to 2 days. This is great if taking into account it sports a screen at 6.44 inches.. As for charging, this handset supports QC3.0, parallel fast charge technology, and OTG reverse charging. Its box includes a 12V / 1.5A (about 18W) power adapter. We tested the charging speed as well. It turns out, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 can fully charge in 2 hours and 24 minutes. Seems this is too long, but if this handset was powered with a 3500mAh battery, it will take only 90 minutes to charge.. The big-screen handsets have never boasted of great camera modules. But when the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 was announced, Lei Jun was proud to say this handset comes with the same Sony IMX386 sensor as the Xiaomi Mi 6. Thus, this phone features a 12MP camera with f/2.2 aperture, PDAF support, and Xiaomi’s ‘low light quality enhancement’ algorithm. There is also a 5MP shooter on the front, which is quite sufficient if taking into account we are dealing with a 2000-yuan device.. However, the sensor size should be explained not to make people confused. I mean we have to learn a few things to understand this phone is not capable of taking photos at the same quality as the Xiaomi Mi 6. So, when we say ‘sensor’, it refers to ‘CMOS’ – the core part of a camera equivalent to our eyes. It is responsible for recording and conversion. The sensor area can differ in the same 12 million pixels. The larger the area of a single pixel, the better the picture quality. As for now, the largest non-custom CMOS can be found on the Xiaomi Mi 5S and Google Pixel. They use the IMX378 sensor with a single pixel of 1.55um and 1.23 inches of CMOS area. The IMX386 has a single pixel of 1.12um and 1/29 inches of CMOS area.. So what we can say for these handsets, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 and Mi 6? Though they are packed with the same sensor, the hardware, software, and other features affect the shooting performance. For example, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 doesn’t have Mi 6’s 4-ahix OIS. Another difference, the Mi Max 2 comes with an f/2.2 aperture, while the Mi 6 does an f/1.8. Honestly, these features have too less common with the sensor, but the affect the photo quality and the overall performance.. Anyway, thanks to the IMX368 sensor the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 can provide good shootings. This is mainly reflected in the screen sharpness and color reproduction that are seen on daytime samples.. Unfortunately, we can’t say the same for nighttime shoots.. Starting from the Xiaomi Mi 6 all Xiaomi handsets come with MIUI8 based on Android 7.1.1. The Mi Max 2 is no exception. Though there are not many changes in this software in comparison to earlier versions, there are at least three featured added for this phone especially – ‘one-hand mode’, ‘split-screen mode’ and ‘super floating bar’.. The phone comes with an infrared emission function that allows users to remotely control Mi TV / box, regular TV sets, air conditioners, amplifiers and other home appliances.. As for the ‘super floating bar’, it’s not a system-level app. So you should download a special them designed for the Mi Max 2 in order to use it. Moreover, no need to unlock the phone to use it. A long press on the locked screen (left or right) will activate the feature including up to 21 apps and functions.. This is a Mi family phone. Thus it’s been made with high ambitions in mind. But let’s not confuse it with the main flagships of the company in face of the Mi 6, the upcoming Mi Note 3 and Mi MIX 2. I mean the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is a great handset for those who are looking for a large-screen + large-battery device. It’s also one of the best offers if taking into account the hardware and price ratio. But never think to put it next to the aforementioned smartphones. So we can say Xiaomi has managed to come in with the best device for a certain niche once again. In this sense, probably you won’t be able to find anything better than the Mi Max 2. Agree 1699 yuan ($250) is a great price tag for Xiaomi device sporting a number of decent specs such as a 6.44-inch screen, 5300mAh battery, and Snapdragon 625 chip.. $209.99 on Gearbest XiaomiToday Best Deals.

Xiaomi tried something different last year. Instead of continuing with the regular screen sizes (between 4-inches to 5.5-inches), Xiaomi introduced a smartphone with a massive 6.44-inch display. It wasn’t the first one to do so, however, as Lenovo had already released its Phab series back then. At the time of the Mi Max launch, Xiaomi India bet on a large display phone, almost nearing the 7-inch tablet size, along with a large battery capacity. Xiaomi managed to sell over three. Clearly, the device resonated with a lot of consumers. One year later, Xiaomi is back with the next version of the large screen device, simply called Mi Max 2. Will it repeat the magic of the first iteration? Let us find out below.. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has undergone a design. refresh, which is especially noticeable when you place it beside the earlier model. For starters, the edges have got the rounding treatment, and it's unlike the Mi Max, where the rear side of the phone just curved in around the corners. The body is all metal and there are no plastic bits on the top and bottom edge, as was the case with the Mi Max. Thereby making it slightly heavier than the Mi Max. The black coloured Mi Max 2 that I had for review has a metal back which can tend to get quite slippery at times. Whoever held the device, the first thing they pointed out was how slippery it was, this was even before turning it on (Take note, Xiaomi!). The antenna lines curve around the top and bottom edges, which tend. to almost merge with the black colour.. The big screen Xiaomi Mi Max 2. On the rear side, you have the circular fingerprint scanner in the top half and the 12 MP camera module is present on the top left-hand corner along with a dual LED flash unit. The base houses the USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer. Beside the USB port are the speaker grilles, only one side of which houses a. The other speaker section is within the ear piece.. Coming to the front, there is the 6.44-inch display, which has slimmer bezels on the side as compared to the top and bottom. At the top, you have the earpiece speaker, ambient light sensor and a 5 MP front-facing camera. The left-hand edge houses the hybrid dual SIM tray and on the right-hand side, there are the power/standby and volume rocker buttons. These are made of metal and have good feedback.. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has undergone a design refinement. The power and volume rocker buttons on the right. Overall, the build quality of the Mi Max 2 is quite good, but I would’ve liked a bit more grip on the device. But this can be overcome by putting on a cover. While the size of the phone is huge, it did manage to fit into my jeans' pockets, although with the top portion jutting out. One-handed use is out of the question though, unless you use it in the one-handed mode, which I would avoid as the phone feels. top heavy when held in one hand.. One would assume that Xiaomi would have gone all out with the second generation Mi Max, but that is not the case. On the display side, things haven’t really changed. You still get a 6.44-inch Full HD display. It houses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC which comes with eight Cortex A53 cores clocked at 2.0 GHz along with an Adreno 506 GPU. The Mi Max came with a more powerful Snapdragon 652 chipset. Now while the number may be higher, you need to note that the Snapdragon 652 was built on the 28 nm process, whereas the Snapdragon 625 is built on the 14 nm process. Overall, the result should be a device that's almost as powerful as its predecessor, but at the same time, much more efficient.. With the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 you can forget one handed use of your phone. You get a 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage option on the Mi Max 2 along with the option to expand the storage to 256 GB. Since this phone comes with a hybrid SIM card slot, you will need to sacrifice one slot for either a microSD card or a second SIM card.. The rear camera is now a 12 MP Sony IMX386 unit with an f/2.2 aperture and there is a 5 MP front-facing camera. The phone comes with a "dual-stereo" effect with one speaker section on the base and the other being the earpiece speaker. A massive 5,300 mAh battery powers the device.. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 comes with a USB Type-C port. In terms of connectivity, you get dual band LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS and even FM radio.. The 6.44-inch display is the highlight of the Mi Max 2. Just like its earlier version, the Mi Max 2 also comes with a Full HD display. The 2.5D display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, thereby making it scratch and smudge resistant. The brightness levels of the display are quite good. It can get a tad reflective at times though, and you would like to avoid any direct light source in the background. But considering the 6.44-inch display, I would have liked to see scaling options which would let me add more app icons per row. As it stands, you can only adjust the text size and there are four app icons per row, which seems like an unnecessary waste of space. if you have a lot of apps,. there will be that many home screens to swipe through. Either that or you'll have to use multiple folders.. Thanks to the large display it is a pleasure to read long articles and ebooks. In terms of the video viewing experience, there wasn’t much of a problem. But viewing angles are not the best. You can immediately spot a contrast shift if you look at it from even a slight angle. For a smartphone which capitalises on the content consumption audience, this isn’t desirable. Agreed, you will be viewing content with the phone placed in a limited angle range. But it is still surprising that Xiaomi would even remotely consider compromising on this aspect of the display.. Black levels are not the best, but are good enough. There were instances when watching a dark scene in a video that we noticed some backlight bleeding. This does not affect the movie viewing experience, but if you are coming from an AMOLED display device, you will tend to notice these issues. Gaming was quite a good experience on the big screen.. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 runs Android Nougat 7.1.1 out of the box, of course with the MIUI 8.5 skin atop it. It does come pre-bundled with a lot of apps which you may or may not want to use. The UI has become familiar to a lot of Xiaomi users over the years. One interesting feature that is present on the MIUI 8 is Dual apps, which lets you run two instances of the same app on the phone. Think two WhatsApp accounts tied to. different numbers on the same phone. Second Space lets you have two front ends for different occasions, such as work or home.. As mentioned in the display section, I would have liked to see the option of scaling the icons. It just makes sense to have that feature on such a large display so that you can pack more app icons per homepage. You also get the Reading mode, which cuts down on the blue light. The battery section is granular to a level where you can go into individual apps and set if you want it to run the background, for saving power. There is a Quick Ball button which lets you access quick functions or apps, up to five of them. It is quite a handy feature.. The split-screen functionality which Xiaomi advertises as one of the major features, and something that should be a no-brainer for a device with a large display such as the Mi Max 2, is yet to see the light of the day on the device. Right now, you will need to run a beta version of MIUI to activate the Split screen mode. Why it is not on by default is something only Xiaomi can answer.. There were a few instances when taking or cutting a call that I noticed some strange bugs. For instance, the music would sometimes not stop when receiving a call. At other times, I'd have to tap multiple times on the end call button to end the call. These are issues which can be resolved with software updates in the future.. First things first, the Mi Max 2 is a step down from the Mi Max in terms of performance numbers. The Snapdragon 625 along with 4 GB RAM gives decent performance numbers for its price segment, but it isn’t anywhere close to flagship territory, so don’t set very. When it comes to day to day usage, there isn’t much to complain about. The segment towards which this phone is targeted is that one that. values a large display and a big battery. And on those fronts, there aren’t many pain points (although the display does have. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 performance benchmarks Infogram. When it came to gaming, there was some micro stutter noticeable while playing Asphalt Xtreme. It isn’t a big problem though and does not mar the overall experience. One thing I really liked was the fact that there was no sudden heating of the device even while playing heavy, 3D games. This is a definite plus point in a hot country like ours. There were also no instances of random app shutdowns. Call quality is top notch, you just have to get used to handling such a large phone while taking a call.. On the whole, I would not take away much from this section as there were no annoying issues with daily performance.. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 bundles a 12 MP rear camera with 1.25-micron pixels, and an f/2.2 aperture. For the front camera, you get a 5 MP unit. There is no optical image stabilisation on board. The camera interface is similar to what we have seen on other Xiaomi smartphones with MIUI 8 on board. You get modes such as panorama, manual, beautify, tilt-shift, and even something called group shot, which lets you take multiple photos of groups so you can later select the best one.. There is a 12 MP rear camera with an f/2.2 aperture. In terms of image quality, it is hit and miss. I did manage to get some good shots when the subject was steady, but shooting moving objects is not so much fun. Daylight images turn out to be quite detailed, and focussing is quick. But indoors and under low light, the tables turn. The detail is missing on eight out of ten shots. Shooting at night on the streets ends up giving patchy images. The noise reducing algorithms seem to work in overdrive at times. Shooting far off objects in daylight or even indoors gives a noisy image. Getting a focus lock on a busy street is also a pain. Selfies are decent though, but only in daylight.. The video mode lets you shoot in up to 4K resolution and supports timelapse and slow motion recording as well. As with the still photos, the video shooting also throws up good results only in well lit situations. Since there is no image stabilisation on board, expect shaky footage.. Overall, if I want to capture some important moment or events, I know that the Mi Max 2 will not be my primary camera.. With a 5,300 mAh capacity battery, this is the only reason to think of investing in this phone. There were days when I could extract two full days worth of battery life from the Mi Max 2 — a 100 percent charge on Saturday morning, and going under 10 percent only on Monday night. The PC Mark for Android benchmark crashed the two times I tried it. Even with heavy usage involving streaming movies, playing music, surfing the web, multiple social media accounts on sync and gaming, you can still easily extract a day and a half of usage from the phone. Xiaomi also lets you use the Mi Max 2 as a powerbank to charge another phone, although you will need a USB Type C to Type A adapter for it. It’s not bundled with the box.. One thing I was really worried about with the large capacity 5,300 mAh battery was the charging time it would take. Thanks to the bundled charger though, that issue is taken care of and within two hours, you get a fully charged phone. This is impressive on all counts. So if you are planning to go on a weekend trip, and happen to forget your charger, that won’t be an issue for the Mi Max 2.. To put it in a nutshell, go for this device only if you have two major needs — long lasting battery and media consumption. The large battery and display are the unique selling points of this phone, as in every other department you can find better faring alternatives, some from Xiaomi itself. Also, the large size of the phone means that it is not suitable for use for everyone.. in the Mi Max series does not ace all the performance numbers, it still delivers a good overall user experience in real world usage. I liked the fact that the phone does not heat up when playing games or using the video camera. Fitting the phone into your jeans or trouser pockets can be challenging for some. There is always some portion of the phone that is jutting out.. It would have been great to have a consistent camera performance on the Mi Max 2, but maybe Xiaomi can try to fix that with a software update.. In the large display space, Mi Max 2 has little competition at its price and feature set. If you can extend your budget, there's the Lenovo Phab. 2 Pro , a 6.44-inch display phone, which comes with support for. If the camera is an important requirement for you, then you are better off going for the Oppo F3 Plus which has a 6-inch display, 4,000 mAh battery, slightly better chipset and a better camera.. #Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Price In India.
