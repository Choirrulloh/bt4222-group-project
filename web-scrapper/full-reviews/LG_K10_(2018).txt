Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018), A8+ (2018), and LG K10 (2018) to be announced at CES in January. Samsung Android LG Rumors. Samsung's much leaked Galaxy A8 (2018) and A8+ (2018) are going to be unveiled at CES, according to a new rumor out of South Korea. LG won't let Samsung have the whole spotlight to itself though, as it also plans to announce the K10 (2018) on the same occasion.. The A8 duo for 2018 will come with 18:9 Infinity Displays and very small bezels. The A8+'s screen will be 6" in size, while the A8 will settle for 5.5". They will ship with Bixby Home and Bixby Remind, at least in Korea, but will not have Bixby Voice installed (or a Bixby button). You will get 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a 16 MP main camera, a 16 MP + 8 MP dual selfie shooter, as well as a 3,500 mAh battery if you go for the bigger model.. Both handsets will support Samsung Pay and will have a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, a USB Type-C port, and a 3.5mm headset jack. Split-screen multitasking is in, of course, as well as 'Pop-Up View' that will let you see more than two apps at the same time. They will be out in Korea in mid-January, with other markets presumably getting them at around the same time or soon afterwards.. LG will launch the successor to this year's K10 , which is said to be thinner than that model and boast a 5.3-inch 1080p display, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, a 13 MP main camera, and a 5 MP selfie snapper. A 3,000 mAh battery will keep the lights on. The new K10 will have an FM radio, and will be released in Korea at the end of next month.. The Galaxy S9 and LG G7 are most likely to be introduced "after February", this report goes on to claim. Apparently, Sony aims to reveal its first "bezel-less" smartphone at MWC 2018, where Huawei might also present the P11 series..

Before properly unveiling and fully detailing that “2018 version” of the high-end V30 , and way before launching “Judy” under a different name than G7 , LG decided to get a head start on its MWC 2018 announcements earlier today with refreshed low to mid-end K8 and K10 models.. Even though the two have been purportedly “enhanced with even more premium features rivaling those of premium flagships”, pre-installed Android Oreo, dual rear-facing cameras and 18:9 aspect ratios lead the list of notable omissions.. Still, the 2018 edition of the (moderately) popular LG K10 handset does (marginally) upgrade its predecessor’s battery capacity, RAM and ROM, as well as the selfie shooter megapixel count.. The 720p 5.3-inch screen is unfortunately unchanged, while the “advanced” 13MP rear camera apparently uses “technology found in the flagship LG G6.” You get up to 3GB RAM, 16 or 32GB internal storage, a respectable 3,000mAh cell, and an unnamed 1.5 GHz octa-core processor, which is never a good sign. Also, a 5 or 8MP front-facing cam, the latter of which supports Bokeh for selfies.. Unsurprisingly, the LG K8 (2018) is an even humbler affair, powered by a mysterious 1.3 GHz quad-core chipset, with 2GB RAM, 16GB ROM, and a modest 2,500mAh battery also in tow.. The 5-inch HD panel, 8MP rear and 5MP front cameras don’t seem special either, although LG is trying hard to push “more advanced camera UX features” and improved low-light photography as key selling points.. Running Android 7.1.2 Nougat out the box, the LG K10 (2018) and K8 (2018) aim to stand out with proprietary software features like Auto Shot, Gesture Shot, Quick Share, Timer Helper and Flash Jump Shot. The higher-end model has Phase Detection Auto Focus going for it as well, not to mention it looks better on the outside, thanks to a “classy metallic design.” Alas, pricing remains a mystery, at least until next week ..

Adrian Diaconescu December 15, 2017 11:59 am. Now that it’s crystal clear Synaptics wasn’t talking about the Samsung Galaxy S9 when teasing a CES 2018 demo of the world’s first “full-production” phone with in-display fingerprint recognition , you may have lost all your excitement for the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show .. But fret not, as the GS9 duo and LG G7 announcements of February or March will likely be preceded by January launches of Samsung’s upper mid-range Galaxy A8 and A8 Plus, as well as LG’s low to mid-end K10 (2018).. That’s obviously in addition to already unveiled laptops from both companies , which will definitely be exhibited and further detailed in Las Vegas in a few weeks. The Galaxy A8+ is also no big secret , with its oft-leaked specifications practically set in stone now by Korean media.. ET News sure seems to know a lot about the LG K10 (2018) too, although technically, the 5.3-incher hasn’t been officially announced just yet. Sharper than the 2017 edition , with Full HD screen resolution in tow, the 2018 budget-friendly release reportedly packs an unnamed 1.2GHz quad-core processor, 3GB RAM, and 32GB internal storage space.. Interestingly enough, the K10 (2018) is expected to be thinner than the already thin 7.9mm K10 (2017), while somehow also featuring a larger 3,000mAh battery. There should be a fingerprint reader mounted on the new K10’s back, LG Pay support, a 13MP main camera, 5MP selfie shooter, and even built-in FM radio functionality for emergency situations.. Samsung’s revised A-series devices and LG’s K-series upgrade are primarily headed for markets like South America, India and of course South Korea. Pricing remains under wraps for the time being..

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. LG K10, K8 2018 phones put the focus on photos. JC Torres - Feb 21, 2018. LG may have said it’s tempering its smartphone frenzy, unlike Samsung, but that seems to only apply to its higher end phones. In addition to the LG V30 (2018), it will also be introducing two, actually four, new mid-range models as well. Carrying on its K series, the new K10 (2018) and K8 (2018) follow that pattern of small improvements. But for shutterbugs on a budget, both smartphones might have something to offer in terms of features and gimmicks, not necessarily quality.. Neither the K10 nor the K8 have changed that much compared to last year’s models. Subtle design changes here, a few new specs there and that’s pretty much it. The two don’t even have the 18:9 screen aspect ratio that LG has been so proud of. Instead, LG wants to turn would be buyers’ attention to the cameras..

PDAF and a faster autofocus promise you won’t miss a moment.

The front camera naturally supports bokeh features.. • Operating System: Android 7.1.2 Nougat. • CPU: 1.5 GHz octa-core. • RAM: 2 or 3 GB. • Storage: 16 or 32 GB. • Display: 5.3-inch 1280×720 HD. • Main Camera: 8 or 13 megapixel. • Secondary Camera: 5 or 8 megapixel wide-angle. The LG K8 (2018)’s cameras are less impressive, so LG is making up for it with a slew of software features instead. LG’s Auto Shot, Gesture Shot, and display Flash for selifes are present. New as well are Timer Helper, which blinks the flash as a timer cue, and Flash Jump Shot, which takes a photo every 3 seconds and stitches them into an animated GIF. That said, these features are not exclusive to the K8 but can also be found on the K10.. • Operating System: Android 7.1.2 Nougat. • CPU: 1.3 GHz octa-core. • Display: 5.0-inch 1280×720 HD. • Main Camera: 8 megapixel. • Secondary Camera: 5 megapixel. The LG K8 (2018) and LG K10 (2018), the latter coming in Plus and Alpha versions as well, will debut at MWC 2018 next week before rolling out to Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.

Report: LG K10 (2018) To Bring LG Pay To The Mid-Tier Market. December 18, 2017 - Written By Mihai Matei. According to a recent report from South Korea, LG Pay will debut on the company’s mid-range smartphone segment early next year alongside the upcoming LG K10 (2018). The aforementioned device will be the company’s first non-flagship phone to employ the mobile payment solution and is expected to be officially introduced at CES in Las Vegas next month as a direct sequel to this year’s K10 released in February.. LG Pay was introduced in South Korea earlier in mid-2017 supporting both contactless payments through NFC as well as wireless magnetic communication for point of sale terminals supporting only contactless or magnetic strip cards. So far the company’s homeland has remained the only region where the service is available, and moreover, LG Pay is currently compatible only with select LG flagships, specifically the LG G6 and its two variations – the G6 Plus and G6 Pro. This will reportedly change in roughly one month from the time of this writing, as the Korean company is now apparently set to introduce LG Pay onto its non-flagship K series, or at least the upcoming LG K10 (2018), though presumably, other mid-range smartphones from the K lineup will eventually follow in the aforementioned model’s footsteps..

Though not much is known regarding the LG K10 (2018), the smartphone is expected to improve upon some of the characteristics presented by the 2017 model, including the display. The sequel will reportedly pack a similarly sized 5.3-inch display which will accommodate a higher FHD resolution, and although it will adopt a chipset from MediaTek, not unlike the 2018 model, it will likely be a newer silicon. Regardless, the SoC is expected to be coupled with 3GB of RAM up from this year’s model’s 2GB, and should also accommodate 32GB of on-board memory expandable via microSD, as opposed to 16GB of storage. The 2017 model was released with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box but as yet it’s unclear whether the LG K10 (2018) will make use of Google’s more recent Android OS iteration Oreo. The ongoing model also boasts a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, and with the inclusion of LG Pay, it’s very likely that the sequel will also employ a similar technology for secure authentication..
