Disable RAM helper..its a virus which s installed by xolo ...you can also scan phone by 360 total security it show u d virus. To all who complain about automatic software/application download and instal should Note that there are usually only two reasons for this to happen. If game/application is installing when you are not using internet, then the mobile service provider is doing the instal and Balance cut without your knowledge. For this the mobile should not be blamed. The only options are complain to the service provider or change the service provider. If game/application/software is downloading and installing while you are browsing the internet then it is possible that the website you are visiting is accidently or deliberately downloading the software. Many unscrupulous website download free apps or games as they want more and more users. Such downloads will not result in balance cut. You can usually see the download of the app/game in the download option of your browser. If app/game gets downloaded when using browser and balance gets cut, then it means that the website you are visiting has links to the app/game which you have accidentally or deliberately clicked (touched) this problem is most in touch phones. Even if you are trying to scroll the Webpage and there are links there, it may get clicked even if that was not what you wanted. Donot use any browser for a few days and see if apps still get downloaded. If yes then daily is with service provider. When apps get installed, check sms. If there is a sms, then probably you accidently clicked a link on some webpage. Donot blindly go to any webpage via search engines or links. Manoj, 25 Jan 2017 In my phone, some softwares are installed automatically when i connect internet. more The automatic software instal is because of the website you are going to. Some websites do an automatic download of software which is either virus or some application that they want you to use. Also, in websites sometimes there are links which if you touch ( even accidentally while scrolling) will cause software download and balance cut. One should visit only reputed websites..

Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 1.0 out of 5 stars I won't buy xolo phones again.. 2) I had Xolo q700 as my 2nd smartphone, first was micromax ninja a89. 3) The ninja a89 was a beast budget phone in my friend circle at that time when android phones were new. 4) I sold it and bought xolo q700, which had great battery but IMEI no corrupted and I got it replaced from the service centre with xolo q700s as there was no stock available. And it took 4 months for that process. 5) The q700s had good camera compared to q700 but the battery usedto die up in 2 hours. 6) I sold it for 3k and bought this one at 4444 and made biggest mistake. 7) This was the worst phone I used in my life. Worst if compared right now with the micromax's ninja a89 which was launched in feb, 2013. 8) Requested for refund from amazon, first refused because of no defect to the phone. 9) Then I found that there was mentioned on amazon website that this phone has autofocus and it didn't. So requested for refund again on the base of wrong information provided and I got my refund as well as got rid off the xolo phones in my life. 10) Worst service centers and worst products from Xolo, would never buy any product from xolo again..

Xolo Era 4G Review, Price and Specifications. Xolo has been throwing in many Era smartphones lately. Not too long ago we saw Era HD and Era 4K and now the domestic manufacturer is pitching Era 4G, an entry level handset which supports 4G LTE connectivity. Since all smartphones have already migrated to 64 bit chipsets, the presence of 4G is something that comes as a side bonus, since all 64-bit chips today are 4G LTE enabled. So pretty much every new phone you buy supports 4G. What else Era 4G got? Let's see. The handset comes with a 5 Inch HD display protected by Gorilla Glass on top. The handset is powered by low-cost 1.5GHz Quad-core Spreadtrum SC9830A processor with Mali-400MP2 GPU, 1GB LPDDR3 RAM, 8GB internal storage and microSD card slot to further augment it. For photography, there is 5MP rear camera with dual LED flash and F2.0 aperture 5P Largan lens, and a 2MP front camera also with LED flash. Megapixel count is futile when it comes to judging camera performance, but on paper everything sounds good for the price. Other features include Android 5.1 Lollipop, dual SIM support, VoLTE support, 2500 mAh battery and VoLTE support. VoLTE allows you to route voice calls through 4G bands for better quality. You data remains on even when you are on a call. The TSP support for the same is missing in India as of now, but Reliance Jio will soon bring VoLTE support to India. Xolo Era 4G is most phones you can get at this price. Its hard to recommend anything with less than 2GB RAM with a 64 bit processor, but basic users might be able to make ends meet. Xolo Era 4g Price in India is 4777 INR. The best price of Xolo Era 4G is expected to remain 4,777 INR for sometime since the handset is exclusive to Snapdeal. You will have to register for the sale, which will be held on 26th February. You can also keep taps on the lowest price of Xolo Era 4G by setting an alert above.. 4G LTE with VoLTE support HD display. HD display Xperia look 4g volte support No hanging problem Budget phone. Camera should be 8and 5 mp Camera should be autofocus. 1st zolo turned out to be best. Expecting below par performer but it was shockibg good.. Cpu 1.5 ghz fast Lipo battery long last.

The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device.

The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time 13.50 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min).

By Anirudh Tapase | 2 Oct 2015. The most sad thing is there is no service center near by. Takes more than a month to get repaired. Staff at service station is rude and uses duplicate parts (my experience at Suraj Enterprises, Pune, Maharashtra) due to unavailability of original spares. My Q700 got damaged within couple of months after changing display & touchscreen. The worst is the support guys are not helpful at all. Please don't buy any Xolo phone in India, The spares are not available too. It is waste of your valuable money. Go for other makes which has max. service stations and spares readily available. Don't want to given even a single star rating.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 4 out of 4 people found this review helpful. Xolo Era With 8-Megapixel Camera Launched at Rs.
