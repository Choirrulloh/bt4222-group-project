Released on September 6, 2014, it is a successor to the original Moto G released in 2013.

The Moto G 2nd Generation supports 2G and 3G connectivity in all its variants, with 4G LTE available in the XT1072 and XT1079 models. It is available in a dual SIM model in selected markets. The device includes a non-removable 2070 mAh battery (2390 mAh for 4G version), which Motorola touts as providing "all-day" battery life. The Moto G features an 8-megapixel rear-facing auto-focus camera with flash and a front-facing 2-megapixel camera. The device is available in either black or white front colors, and has an interchangeable rear cover with different color options.. The Moto G shares its design language with the Moto X and Moto E, although there are some key differences between them. To cut costs, the Moto G lacks the Moto X's low power coprocessor that would allow active notifications, quick capture, and touchless control. The Moto G's Lollipop update added Ambient Display, albeit limited to new notifications.. All variants support four 2G GSM bands 850/900/1800/1900..

The second generation Moto G was initially shipped with Android KitKat (4.4.4), using a mostly stock user experience with additional, proprietary software features; including Moto Alert, which allows users to notify others of their location. Moto Assist, as introduced by the Moto X, which automatically enables or disables certain modes, such as silencing the ringer or auto replying to text messages, depending on certain scenarios—such as when a user is in a meeting as determined by their calendar, or driving, Motorola Migrate and the usual Google Applications package. The handset comes preloaded with Google Now Launcher as the default home screen launcher. But now it is built along with lollipop 5.0 and can be easily updated to marshmallow.. The Motorola Moto G 2nd generation received an Android 4.4.4 KitKat Maintenance Update in September 2014. The update was for version 21.11.23 and brings various bug fixes and performance improvements. The main change noticed in this update is the Google Now Launcher, improvement in battery life, new language and input options, a new camera picture-taking sound and a brand new design for the "Powered By Android" logo on the boot screen.. The Android Lollipop 5.0 update began rolling out in November 2014. This update was for version 22.11.6. [12] The Pure Edition of this phone in the US (carrier unlocked version) became the world's first mobile phone, after Google's current Nexus models, to be updated to Android 5.0.. The Android Lollipop 5.0.2 update became available in several non-US countries including Australia, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom in January/February 2015. Marshmallow update has been rolled out for Moto G 2nd Gen (both titan and thea) in India on 10 February 2016. [16] Motorola has published the release notes for the Marshmallow update which details the enhancements in the new update. The Moto G 2nd Generation received extremely positive reviews from critics with several websites calling it one of the best budget smartphones of 2014. It was mainly praised for its smooth performance after its Lollipop update. Michael Sawh of trustedreviews.com gave it 9 out of 10 stars, praising its strong battery life and excellent value for money. [18] GSMchoice claims that the Moto G 2nd Generation is a good quality product. However, compared to the previous model, it did not offer anything special. According to GSMchoice, the Moto G 2nd generation's advantages are: dual sim, micro SD card slot, USB OTG, good stereo speakers, good quality camera, good call quality, and all the features that most users need without adding bloat. Disadvantages include a poor sales package, durability of plastic bezel, and lack of LTE in some models. ^ "Information: Motorola Moto G 2014 ("titan")".
