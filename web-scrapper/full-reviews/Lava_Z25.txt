Jamshed Avari , 11 April 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Lava Z25 has a metal body and is priced at Rs. Overall performance is good, but the cameras are disappointing. Lava uses a custom Android skin called Star OS. Lava Z25 design Lava Z25 specifications and software Lava Z25 camera performance Lava Z25 performance. Lava is one of the many Indian companies affected by the massive number of affordable Chinese smartphones making their way into India. As buyers, we're obviously happy to see better features and lower prices, and that's exactly what we're getting with so many strong players battling it out in the market. Lava has been pretty low-key for the past year while attention has been focused on its competitors, but the company is now making a renewed effort.. The Lava Z10 and Lava Z25 , which were launched just a few weeks ago , both boast of premium metal bodies and modern features including 4G and VoLTE support. The Z10 is priced at Rs. 11,500 which is a very hot category to be in. On the other hand, the Z25 is a bit more ambitious, and its launch price of Rs. 18,000 indicates that Lava wants to make a play for a more discerning audience .. We're reviewing the latter model today and while Lava boasts of features like its camera and battery life, the most interesting thing about it to us is the fact that it's the company's most expensive model, by a significant margin. This is new territory for the Indian stalwart, and we're eager to see what choices it has made.. Lava is quick to point out that the 88.6 percent of the Z25's body is metal, but while it might be new for the company, it isn't really out of the ordinary to us. The front of the phone has now-obligatory curved edges, but you can't really feel them because there's a plastic rim around the whole thing. Interestingly, Lava uses the term "2.5D" to describe the curves but goes to great lengths to avoid saying anywhere that the front panel is glass. There's no mention of reinforcement either, which is a cause of concern.. That said, the Lava Z25 is still pretty slick, and looks like it's been built well. It feels solid and we had no problem holding and using it with either one or both hands. This phone is available in either grey or gold, and our review unit was the latter. Thankfully, the colour is very subtle. We did notice scuffs on the plastic rim after a week or so of usage, which was the only disappointment.. The phone's layout is pretty standard, and we've seen this template plenty of times before, down to the antenna strips across the top and bottom of the rear. You'll find a 3.5mm audio socket on the top, a Micro-USB port and speaker on the bottom, volume buttons on the left, and power button plus SIM/microSD tray on the right. There's a camera flash and a notification LED above the display but nothing below it, since the Lava Z25 uses on-screen buttons. The main camera is in the centre of the top rear, with the fingerprint sensor below it. The only branding anywhere to be seen is a tiny Lava logo in the centre of the back.. While the Z25 is definitely a step up for Lava in terms of aesthetics as well as build quality, we're a bit concerned about how long this phone will hold up to the rigours of everyday use. It seems that the company is aware of this, because you get a flexible plastic shell and an adhesive scratch protector in the box, plus a one-time screen replacement in addition to standard warranty.. The Lava Z25 is built around a MediaTek MT6750 SoC, which has eight ARM Cortex-A53 cores running at between 1GHz and 1.5Ghz, plus integrated ARM Mali-T860 MP2 graphics. You get a generous 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, plus support for microSD cards of up to 128GB.. The screen measures 5.5 inches and has a resolution of 720x1280, which is a bit of a surprise considering that full-HD is quite common at this price level and below. The battery is sealed in and has a capacity of 3020mAh. The primary camera has a 13-megapixel Sony IMX258 sensor with PDAF and an f/2.0 aperture. The front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor and an f/2.0 aperture as well.. The hybrid dual-SIM tray has cutouts for one micro-SIM and one nano-SIM or a microSD card. The Z25 supports 4G as well as VoLTE, though only on one SIM at a time. Other connectivity standards include Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, and USB-OTG.. The Lava Z25 runs a heavily customised version of Android 6.0 called Star OS 3.3. Predictably, it's a single-layer UI with all icons and widgets spread out across the home screens. This can be difficult to manage if you install a lot of apps. The Z25 uses on-screen buttons but even years after the Android layout was standardised, we're saddled with a useless Menu button instead of an app switcher - you have to long-press to see your recent apps. You can choose what order the buttons are displayed in, but can't change their functions. In some full-screen apps, the navigation bar kept disappearing when we needed it, and it took multiple swipes in order to just get back to the homescreen.. The Settings app is modified with the Sound and Display sections split off into their own tabbed menus (though there's still a Sound submenu under the main General section). There's no search function and it's sometimes difficult to find what you need. You can enable various tap and gesture shortcuts that will wake the phone and launch directly into some apps. This could have been useful for when the phone is lying on a table within reach, but with the fingerprint sensor on the back, it's often quicker to just pick the phone up. You can create your own gesture to trigger an app, function, or call/ message to a specific contact.. There's a massive amount of preloaded bloatware on this phone including five Jio apps and a link to download eight more. Star OS has its own browser (which wants all kinds of permissions including the ability to record audio) plus UC Browser and Chrome. There are redundant Notes, Gallery, Video, and Music apps in addition to Google's default ones. App World is a custom app store with seemingly only a few sponsored listings and some low-quality games. At least the third-party apps - Amazon, Hike, Gaana, Dailyhunt, Paytm, News Point, Game Hub and BeautyPlus Me - can be uninstalled.. Lava is touting the Z25 for its "stunning" photo quality, and we put that claim to the test. The app itself is an outright copy of the iOS camera app, but a bit clunkier because of the way settings are buried in submenus - for example, the HDR toggle is two taps and a swipe away. You get a "template" mode which overlays stickers and live information such as the time, weather and location. There's also a GIF mode which could be handy, and a "sound picture" mode which lets you record audio annotations.. "Intelligent" mode uses voice prompts to help you take selfies using the rear camera, which is a curious addition when the front camera itself is supposed to be good. Bokeh mode gives you instructions about composition and makes you hold the camera still while multiple shots are taken in order to blur the background, because there's only one camera. In our experience, shots taken in this mode looked no different to the same shots taken without it.. Photos came out just about okay, with nothing really special to boast about. Daylight shots tended to be a little washed out and textures didn't come through all that well. Autofocus was quick but not always accurate, and we also noticed a slight blur in some samples, possibly caused by low shutter speed. Photos taken at night were bright but only looked good on the phone's small screen. Checking them out in detail showed that there was a lot of noise, because the tradeoff is a loss of detail.. Video recording tops out at 1920x1080 for the rear camera but only 640x480 for the front, which is surprising. Quality was just about okay, but our expectations were higher considering Lava's positioning for this phone. Photos taken with the front camera were also just passable, nothing more. The front flash tended to be blinding and more distracting than useful.. Tap to see full-sized Lava Z25 camera samples.. It might have a clunky software layer, but this phone is no slouch when it comes to running apps. We had no trouble with installing, launching, and using apps. Games such as Dead Trigger 2 ran smoothly and the rear of the phone got only mildly warm. The screen's resolution is a bit low at 720x1280 but you'll only really notice a lack of sharpness if you hold this phone next to one with a full-HD panel. Colours pop nicely and sunlight legibility is decent.. Benchmark performance was good, though it should be noted that there are less expensive phones such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and Honor 6X that perform at the same level or better. We got scores of 41,228 in AnTuTu, 2541 in GeekBench's multi-core test, 5144 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme, and 22fps in GFXBench. That last score is boosted thanks to the low resolution of the Z25's screen.. The battery lasted a surprisingly good 10 hours and. 58 minutes in our HD video loop test. We were able to get through a full day of moderate usage which included a bit of gaming, photography, and media streaming. We're beginning to take fast charging for granted, and it's disappointing that this phone lacks any such capability.. Verdict Overall, Lava seems to have achieved a nice balance of features and capabilities. There's nothing pathbreaking about the Z25 but there's nothing drastically wrong with it either. It has no gimmicks such as dual cameras, and no one feature that stands out as a unique selling point. Despite the hype, camera performance was a letdown. The front-facing camera flash could be seen as an advantage, but there are specifically selfie-focused models such as the Oppo F1s. ( Review ) and Vivo V5. which cost around the same amount.. The Z25 offers slightly better specifications and scores than the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime. ( Review ), but its main problem is that it goes up against several competitors from smaller brands which would be a step up at the same price. The recently launched Moto G5 Plus. ( Review ) is the most obvious alternative at the moment. There are even less expensive options, such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. ( Review ) and Honor 6X. ( Review ), which offer similar or better performance at slightly lower prices. With such competition around, Lava needs to do a bit more if it wants to stand out..

This entry was posted in Mobile Review and tagged lava , mid-range-phone , mobile .. Lava Z25: Getting the basics right. Posted on November 16, 2017 December 6, 2017 by Paul Carroll. 13Mp 1/3″ sensor with 1.12µm pixel size. 8Mp front-facing “selfie-cam” with f/2.0 lens. 1080p@30fps video (720p@30 fps in default mode). Conclusion: Good results in favorable conditions. Looking to make a splash in the smartphone market, Indian manufacturer Lava boasts a range of very competitively-priced devices.. Launched in March 2017, the Lava Z25 is their current flagship offering, running Android v6.0 and featuring a 1Ghz octa-core MediaTek MT6750 chipset, 4Gb RAM and 32Gb internal storage (expandable up to 128Gb).. The device’s photographic capabilities revolve around its 13Mp primary camera equipped with a wide- aperture f/2.0 lens, dual LED-flash module, and phase-detection autofocus. The front-facing “selfie-cam” also offers a high- resolution 8Mp setup, again with a wide-aperture f/2.0 lens, and the Lava Z25 shoots full HD 1080p@30fps video.. Let’s dive into the DxOMark Mobile scores for the Lava Z25 to see how it performs for smartphone photography enthusiasts.. About DxOMark Mobile tests : For scoring and analysis in our smartphone camera reviews, DxOMark engineers capture and evaluate over 1500 test images and more than 2 hours of video both in controlled lab environments and in natural indoor and outdoor scenes.. This article is designed to highlight the most important results of the testing. For more information about the DxOMark Mobile test protocol,. The Lava Z25 has an overall DxOMark mobile of 70 points, but performs better in still image mode, where it achieves a Photo sub-score of 74 points. That’s a respectable result for a device at this end of the market, and in. forgiving lighting conditions, some nice still photos are well within reach. The Lava Z25’s best attributes for still photography are accurate exposures in well-balanced light, fast autofocus performance, as well as generally pleasant color rendering with consistent white balance and good noise reduction in bright light.. Video image quality on the Lava Z25 isn’t quite as strong, with a lower video score of 62 points affecting its overall DxOMark Mobile score. Its key strengths for video are generally good exposures in well-balanced lighting conditions, effective noise reduction (especially in bright light conditions), as well as smooth and fast white balance transitions when tested using changing light sources in laboratory conditions. However, levels of detail are low as the Lava only records 720p video in default mode and the frame rate frequently drops to 15fps in low light, resulting in slightly shaky footage.. Shooting outdoors or in bright light conditions, we achieved many good exposures in well-balanced or low-contrast lighting conditions, which are easier for the device’s light metering system. When exposure was accurate, color rendering was pleasant, with reasonably well-saturated hues. White balance tended to be a little on the warm side in some outdoor photos, but it’s not unpleasant, and some photographers may prefer the richer color tones. We did achieve more neutral color in some outdoor images, and color casts were always consistent across consecutive exposures in the same lighting conditions, which is a bonus. The Lava Z25 achieves the greatest detail and texture in static scenes in very good light, making it a reasonable option for architecture or landscape photography outdoors. Recording good detail in scenes containing subject motion is a little more challenging for the Z25, however, except in very bright light.. In well-balanced lighting conditions we achieved many nice exposures on the Lava Z25, which display a warm but pleasant white balance and nice color rendering.. Indoors and in very low light, it’s more challenging for the Lava Z25 to get good results, with noticeable noise , motion blur , and under-saturated color all evident in our tests. Some indoor exposures are respectable, with good brightness and color saturation , but in very low light (5 lux), images are noticeably underexposed, and at 1 lux (effectively candlelight), not really usable. Capturing fine detail is also difficult indoors, with some motion blur evident on handheld shots at 100 lux, with a significant loss of detail in very low-light conditions of 20 lux, and particularly at 5 lux. Color rendering is acceptable under indoor conditions, but in low light, colors are under-saturated, and some white balance casts and color shading are very noticeable.. Shooting indoors, exposures are acceptable with nice color, but noise is noticeable and a loss of fine detail caused by motion blur is evident even at 100 lux.. Turning on the flash indoors and mixing it with the ambient light often results in overexposed images, with some vignetting (corner shading) evident, as well as a red-eye effect on portraits. Using flash as the only light source, exposures are more accurate, but corner shading is worse, with very dark corners resulting in a buildup of luminance noise, and the red eye effect is very noticeable on portraits.. The Lava Z25 achieves the best flash exposures when using flash as the only light source (above), but heavy corner shading, noticeable luminance noise, and the red eye effect on portraits are all evident.. With a single camera setup on the Lava Z25, there’s no second telephoto lens to call upon for improved zoom shots at short or mid-range distances. It’s possible to “pinch zoom” up to 8x magnification, but as this is a digital zoom, this is essentially the same thing as blowing up or cropping the original image, and some quality is sacrificed.. At short zoom distances of 2x, the loss of fine detail is evident in all lighting conditions, but in bright light, images remain very acceptable and just about usable in low light. At 4x zoom in bright light, some maze and moire effects, as well as a buildup of luminance noise, also reduce overall image quality, but again, images remain reasonably acceptable for many users. To avoid loss of detail and the amplification of the aforementioned artifacts , you should avoid shooting at 4x in low light, or at 8x in any lighting condition (handheld in particular).. Using the Lava Z25’s digital zoom at medium range in bright light conditions does affect overall sharpness , with the loss of fine detail, visible luminance noise and some maze and moiré artifacts, but images remain just about acceptable in these conditions.. Although the single lens setup doesn’t lend itself well for smartphone portraits, the Z25 does feature a bokeh simulation mode to blur backgrounds and help isolate a subject. The depth-of-field effect (background blur) is one of the strongest effects we’ve seen, with a nice shape to the bokeh effect, similar to that achieved optically when using a wide-aperture lens on a DSLR. Depth estimation failures are common, however, with inaccurate masking around the portrait, resulting in parts of the portrait being blurred and areas of the background remaining sharp. When viewing small-scale images on the device’s display, these errors will be less noticeable, but they make successful bokeh portraits challenging. The bokeh effect isn’t repeatable over consecutive shots, either, so it’s worth persevering and getting plenty of shots “in the can” when shooting your people pictures, to ensure that the effect is applied on at least some of them.. The Lava Z25’s bokeh simulation mode applies a strong background blur that’s very striking, but masking errors around the subject result in parts of the portrait being blurred, detracting from the overall usefulness of the feature.. The Lava Z25 achieves a total photo score of 74, which is calculated from its scores in tests that examine different aspects of its performance under different lighting conditions. In this section we’ll take a closer look at these image quality sub-scores.. Achieving an overall exposure score of 74, the Lava Z25 records its best exposures in bright light conditions, where it scored 90 points, although it scored lower in indoor and very low-light conditions, which affected the overall exposure score. Results from shooting color checker patches under consistent lighting in the lab demonstrated that the Lava Z25 is very capable of taking accurate exposures. We also observed this capability in some of our outdoor evaluation scenes, with nice pictures captured in well-balanced lighting conditions.. The smartphone camera records nice pictures in well-balanced lighting conditions, which are easier for it to accurately expose.. In more challenging high-contrast scenes, however, the dynamic range potential of the Lava Z25 is more limited. With no automatic HDR mode available for advanced image processing , a significant loss of detail occurs in both highlight and shadow regions.. In more challenging high-contrast scenes, the lack of an automatic HDR mode results in limited dynamic range, with a loss of detail in both shadows and highlights.. In very low-light conditions (5 lux), images are slightly underexposed, with a loss of detail and color saturation, but remain usable.. Shooting in very low light (5 lux), images from the Lava Z25 are slightly underexposed, especially in the corners due to noticeable vignetting.. The Lava Z25 achieves a very respectable score for color, with nice color rendering in outdoor or bright lighting conditions, but color saturation drops in both indoor and very low-light conditions, which affected its overall color score.. The Lava Z25’s nice color rendering in outdoor images results in reasonably well-saturated color.. A strength for color is repeatable white balance, and although there’s a slightly warm color cast sometimes evident when shooting outdoors, some photographers may appreciate the warm tones. Color casts shift slightly more green. on indoor images, but the fact that white balance remains consistent on consecutive frames in all lighting conditions is a bonus.. White balance is consistent and repeatable, and although some outdoor images display a warm tone (above), the color effect remains pleasant.. In some outdoor exposures the Lava Z25 was spot-on with the white balance, with nice neutral results and pleasant color rendering.. Color shading (when the color changes between the center and edges of the frame ) is very noticeable on the Lava Z25, which impacted its overall color score.. Heavy color shading, shifting from orange in the center to green at the edges, is visible in many of the Lava Z25’s images in all lighting conditions.. The Lava Z25’s autofocus is exceptionally fast in all lighting conditions, with almost no lag between requesting focus and taking a shot, making it one of the device’s best attributes. Although it’s quick, we observed some autofocus irregularities, however, as the device failed to consistently achieve sharp images across a test of 30 consecutive frames. In both bright (1000 lux) and indoor (300 lux) lighting conditions, a few of our consecutive shots missed sharp focus, which affected the overall autofocus score.. After putting the Lava Z25 into an unfocused state, we imposed a short delay of 500ms before asking the device to focus. The Lava locked focus and snapped a picture almost instantaneously in all lighting conditions, but some pictures weren’t sharp, with a handful of our 30 test shots recording only around 60% acutance (sharpness).. The Lava Z25 scored fairly low for texture, as fine detail preservation remains challenging for the device in many lighting conditions and shooting environments. It’s best in bright light when shooting static subjects, and remains just about acceptable in some indoor conditions, although some motion blur starts to creep in. motion blur is very visible in handheld shots of static subjects, and shots with subject movement almost always result in blurred movement, even in bright light conditions.. As it is often the case, the Lava produces less sharp images with moving scenes than with static ones across the ISO range.. In bright light (1000 Lux) the Lava is doing a decent job in terms of detail when compared to older high-end phones, such as the Apple iPhone 6 or Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.. Apple iPhone 6, 1000 Lux, crop. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, 1000 Lux, crop. However, in lower light the difference becomes more obvious, with the Lava smearing more fine textures and detail than the Apple and Samsung at 20 Lux.. Apple iPhone 6, 20 Lux, crop. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, 20 Lux, crop. The Z25 achieved a pretty good score for noise, which is well-controlled in bright light. Some visible luminance noise when shooting outdoors is evident in areas of uniform color, such as the sky, but this isn’t uncommon for mobile devices and the effect isn’t overly strong. Shooting in lower light conditions, greater levels of luminance noise become visible in indoor conditions (100 lux), which starts to affect edge definition. In very low light, noise becomes slightly more visible, but not significantly, and in general it’s well-controlled in all lighting conditions.. Apple iPhone 6, 20 Lux, crop. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, 20 Lux, crop. A number of artifacts or optical deficiencies were evident during our testing, including loss of edge sharpness, vignetting (corner shading), ringing , color fringing , and distortion. The most problematic is the loss of edge sharpness, which can have a serious impact on image quality, particularly if you plan to print or display large-scale images.. A difference in sharpness between the center and edges of the frame is noticeable, especially when viewing large-scale images.. Noticeable vignetting, or corner shading, occurs in low-light conditions, which results in a buildup of more luminance noise; and when shooting towards the sun in outdoor conditions, some color fringing along contrast edges is also visible.. Shooting Lava Z25 in low light (5 lux) results in noticeable corner shading.. Fringing is evident along contrast edges when shooting towards the light.. In flash-only pictures, the flash is nicely centered and exposure is good in the middle of the frame. Very visible corner shading occurs, however, with a resulting buildup of luminance noise in the corners, and portraits often display red eyes, as well as relatively low levels of fine detail preservation. Corner shading is reduced by mixing flash with additional light sources, but images then tend to be slightly overexposed, with red eye and loss of detail still a concern.. Using flash alongside additional light sources, images tend to be slightly overexposed; and although red eye and vignetting are less noticeable than on flash-only exposures, these effects remain visible.. Digital zoom shots on the Lava Z25 display limited resolution and low detail preservation, except in very bright lighting conditions. At 1000 lux (bright outdoor lighting), acceptable detail is possible at short zoom distances up to 2x, but expect less detail at 4x and 8x, even in very bright light. Handheld zoom shots at 4x in very bright light are just about usable, but there’s virtually no discernible detail in low light at 4x or when using the 8x zoom in all lighting conditions. Some artifacts are also visible with digital zoom shots at all magnifications, including noticeable maze and moiré effects in high-frequency details.. Long range zoom shot (approximately 100mm equivalent focal length).. The Lava Z25 achieves a Bokeh score of 20, thanks to a nice shape and look to the background blur, which when applied is one of the strongest depth-of-field effects weve encountered. The device lost points for several depth estimation failures, however, when the device fails to accurately blur just the background and keep the portrait sharp, resulting in slightly problematic portraits, with some parts of the subject being blurred and parts of the background remaining sharp. This is particularly apparent in shots in which parts of the subject, such as a hand, are on a different focal plane to the subject’s face and thus end up being blurred in the same way as the background. The blur transition is also very abrupt, quickly shifting from sharp to strong blur, which can look unsightly and the bokeh effect isn’t repeatable over consecutive shots, with the effect not always applied.. Depth estimation failures in the Lava Z25’s bokeh simulation mode result in very noticeable masking errors around a portrait, so some areas of the background remain sharp and parts of the subject are blurred.. The Lava Z25’s video module achieves a Video score of 62 points, which is notably lower than its Photo score. The overall video score is calculated using the video sub-scores, which give us some insight into its strengths and weakness when shooting video: Exposure (69), Color (73), Autofocus (33), Texture (31), Noise (78), Artifacts (66), and Stabilization (43).. As you can see from the scores, the most concerning areas are autofocus and texture, with the Lava Z25 either not triggering or regularly dropping focus during recording. In default mode the device records 720p video, failing to capture good levels of fine detail, especially in low light conditions. V ideo exposures are generally good in most lighting conditions, however, with consistent results in outdoor and indoor scenes, but with some underexposure in very low light. Noise reduction is also a strength for video, and color rendering is generally pleasant, although some. white balance instabilities are visible during panning and walking scenes. In low light the frame rate frequently drops to 15fps, resulting in shaky footage.. Achieving acceptable target exposures, repeatable white balance,. and fast autofocus, the Lava Z25 gets many of the basics right, making it a solid choice for smartphone photographers on a budget. If you’re looking for a versatile smartphone camera capable of good results in challenging lighting environments, consistent flash results, well-defined details, and good zoom shots, the Lava Z25 might underwhelm a little. So you need to be a little careful and chose favorable conditions to get the best out of the Lava Z25’s camera, but with good technique and some thought, nice results are possible.. Pleasant color in both indoor and outdoor lighting conditions. Good target exposure in many tested environments. Good noise reduction in outdoor conditions. Smooth and fast white balance convergence. Motion blur in some handheld shots. Low resolution and detail in zoom photos. Low frame rate in low-light conditions. Autofocus failures with slow reaction times.

Mobiles / Lava Mobile Phones / Lava Z25 Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 607 Compare. Lava has been around for a while but only recently did they manage to impress with their Z series of mid-range handsets. The brand has now launched a new device called Z25 and has placed under INR 20,000 for Indian buyers. However, there is no such features in the device to fend off the competition and it might fall flat on its face. Here is a brief overview of the handset for those who are looking for mid-range device and have their hearts set on this one.. Sony Exmor RS 13 Megapixels camera: The rear panel of the handset is home to a run of the mill 13 Megapixels snapper, which is nothing impressive. However, what makes the difference here is that the camera module on this handset is Sony Exmor RS 13 sensor, which is known for clicking sharp and crisp images.. Front flash : The handset maker has equipped the new handset with a powerful 8 Megapixels camera on the front panel. However, the camera has been accompanied with a soft LED flash, which makes for a good photopraphy experience no matter how the ambient lighting is.. Fast fingerprint sensor : In today's time, it is natural for a handset at this price to come with the fingerprint scanner. According to the brand, this is one of the fastest fingerprint scanner as it can unlock the handset in just 0.16 seconds.. No NFC : There is no NFC in this handset, which means that if you would like to use Google Pay or other such features in the future, you cannot. This might be a small let down for those who are looking forward to using the feature at some point.. Gray +1 Variants. 14,990 .00. No cost EMI on Credit Cards Apply for Credit Card @ BankBazaar»..

I didn't experience any hanging problems as many people say! It multitasks more than 12 high end apps at a time. The Processor and features of Lava Z25 is a good buy for all general purposes(email,social media,videos,gen apps, medium graphics game settings). If you turn off internet connection and connect sparingly the phone battery will last two days.. Don't Think just go for it. And you will write the same thing about it.. Pls do some changes who have bought this phone... Increase the pointer speed in the settings to improve typing speed. Switch the back camera resolution mode to the highest ...I know it will not capture full screen photo but it captures with more details.. now full screen photos are now outdated as well. Change the lock and desktop wallpaper..apply some colorful and hd wallpaper... its display will show its true colors... I just applied spiderman wallpaper on this phone..I am surprised to know about the display quality of this handset...Awesome Really true and natural colors.. When I compared with the display of many vivo oppo devices like vivo v3 max vivo v5 oppo F1s ..I have found z25 display to be more natural and vibrant... 4.Change the theme to the last one the third one ..I dont remember right now as m typing from my vivo V5 ....And z25 is with my brother who is living Ludhiana Punjab right now.. increase the vibration of keyboard to 28 level from the settings of the keyboard ..It will increase the typing accuracy.. Guys I have observed that this handset is value for money and daylight camera is unmatchable ...U will find many to have a sharper image than this phone but in terms of skin tones and natural colors..its hard to find any phone in this price range. even vivo v5 plus didnt give natural effect .. Good phone with decent performance for this price range. Overall I am satisfied with this product for that price..

Digit Mobile Phones Lava Lava Z25 Lava Z25 Review. Published Date | Last Updated. Our Verdict Lava Z25: Detailed Review. 18000/- Buy Now Set Price Drop Alert. The Lava Z25 is not the budget phone we would recommend, but it is a bold attempt by the company at the segment.. The Lava Z25 has its moments, but it’s an average smartphone overall. It has decent battery life and an above average camera, but it’s outdone by phones like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, Moto G5 Plus and others in almost every way.. PROS Above average camera Well built Decent battery life. CONS Sluggish performance Average display Intrusive UI.

Lava Z25 is currently available at the best price of: ₹18,000. Indian phone maker Lava has been better known for its budget devices, but it recently dashed into a higher market segment with the Lava Z25. The smartphone is the company’s attempt to take on the horde of phones from Chinese phone makers that rule this price bracket. Lava claims that the Z25 has the fastest fingerprint scanner among all smartphones. Also, the company says the rear camera can take “Stunning pictures” and it is apparently 25% faster than its competition. Well, these are some tall claims, but can it live up to those claims? We used the phone for a week to find out.. Priced around the 18K price mark, the Lava Z25 offers similar design and build quality as we have seen on other phones in the same price category. There is nothing particularly new about the design and we would add that the Z25 looks and feels strikingly similar to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. The metal back, rounded edges and a curved glass display are design traits that most companies now follow. Interestingly, this combo seems more seamless on the Z25 as edges feel smoother compared to a Redmi Note 4 or a Gionee A1. That said, the the wider body means it is not as ergonomic as a Moto G5 Plus or even the Gionee A1 .. The rear camera has a slight bump, which we believe could have been avoided since the phone is already 8.5mm thick. The left and right edges have the volume and power keys that offer good feedback and feel sturdy. The hybrid SIM tray is also on the right side and the headphone jack and micro USB port are located at the top and bottom, respectively. The fingerprint sensor sits below the rear camera and is always on. So, you can jump to the home screen without turning the display on. The company claims this is the fastest fingerprint sensor out there and though it’s fast, we really don’t find it much faster than most other smartphones. Phones like the Redmi Note 4 , Honor 6X and others unlock just as fast, at least when looking at them with the naked eye.. The display is a mixed bag. You get a bright 5.5-inch display, but it is just a 720p panel. The phone has a 2.5D curved glass on top and it’s resistant to smudges, making the touch experience quite smooth. But, quite disappointingly, we saw some false touches more than often. Although, with max luminescence of 650 lux, the display would feel bright to most and it can be viewed in all light conditions without squinting.. On the other hand, the UI is downright disappointing. To be perfectly honest, Lava’s UI is intrusive and makes little sense over the stock Android experience. The UI doesn’t add much by way of functionality or features, but it’s a pretty straightforward implementation. You get some gesture controls, but nothing really innovative or revolutionary.. Diving deeper I found that there are three themes and more can’t be added. You cannot set a lockscreen wallpaper, pressing the recents menu actually opens options menu for the home screen, something that takes you back to Ice Cream Sandwich days. You open the recents menu by long pressing the recents button. On the recents screen, a part of the wallpaper still shows at the bottom, which looks a little odd.. There is no search bar in the Settings menu and it is divided into three tabs (General, Sound and Display), which seems unnecessary. The latter two tabs, Sound and Display, do not have extra sub-menus to justify the separation. In comparison, a stock Android settings menu has pretty much the same functionalities, but is simpler to navigate. To be clear, other phones have broken up the Settings menu like this too, but most of them offer a way to retract to Android’s usual form.. However, all these are small niggles compared to amount of bloatware Star OS brings. The UI has a duplicate app for almost all standard applications available in the Android suite. Adding to the annoyance, almost all apps require essential permissions of your contacts or call information, which is concerning from a privacy standpoint. I mean apps like Torch and Browser require your contact information and the clock app wants to manage calls. Why? We have asked Lava for a clarification on the same and are waiting to hear back from them.. In addition the whole UI seems a little sluggish and the choice of using two-year-old Android Marshmallow on a new phone is rather disappointing. In fact, an outdated operating system is a big reason not to buy this phone. It’s not a problem with Lava alone, though. This price range, sadly has only two or three phones running Nougat out-of-the-box.. One of the main culprits of the UI being sluggish is the older and weaker processor. The octa core MT6750 SoC is paired with 4GB of RAM and though it can handle all kinds of apps, it does so sluggishly and feels slow compared to the current gen competition. Be it navigating through the UI itself, switching between apps or opening newer ones, the phone feels slow throughout. Using even the most basic apps, like Facebook, Instagram, Chrome, Youtube or even the in-built SMS messenger, the phone feels slow.. The gaming experience on the phone is also sub-par compared to other sub-20K smartphones. I recorded an average fps of 26 during Asphalt 8 with 80% framerate stability, which means it's playable with some judders. App load times and transition times between menus aren't the fastest, while gaming comes with some judders.. Call quality and reception is good and we didn't find any issues with it. The sound quality via headphones is also quite good. This is of course dependent on the quality and type of headphone you use. The bottom firing speaker, however, is neither loud nor of a good quality. The single speaker gets easily muffled when the phone is in your pocket or on a busy street.. While the performance is slow, battery life is decent. The 3020 mAh non-removable battery is would work for light and moderate users who don’t game or watch movies all day on their phones. For gamers, the phone will last for about 3-4 hours on continuous gaming. Battery consumption is even lower if you are streaming video. In our tests, we recorded a max drop of about 12% while streaming an hour long 720p video over Wi-Fi, which is just about acceptable. As long as you weren’t expecting battery life at par with the Lenovo P2 , Redmi Note 4 or even the Moto G5 Plus, you won’t be disappointed.. The 13MP rear camera on the Lava Z25 is the best camera Lava has ever produced. However, that doesn’t really say much against the current competition. It is not the best by any means, but it has some good things about it. It uses a Sony Exmor sensor with f/2.0 aperture and captures good details in almost all light conditions. It has a tendency to shoot pictures with a soft focus, and thus colours seem a little washed out compared to the other cameras we have seen in the same category. Low light images showcase a similar pattern, but with the addition of visible noise. While there are tons of modes and filters to exploit in the camera app, a pro-mode is missing.. The front facing camera follows on the same footsteps as the rear camera and serves decent images. It captures commendable details, but loses out in offering the perfect colour saturation. Although, the overall colour saturation is slightly better than than of the rear camera. Image quality does deteriorate with dimming light, but the camera still manages to keep decent details for the most part.. In essence, Lava has produced an above average camera here. However, it really doesn’t hold a candle to dual-camera smartphones like the Coolpad Cool 1 and Honor 6X, and is far behind the slightly cheaper Moto G5 Plus.. The Lava Z25 is not the best phone to buy. It has a sluggish performance on offer, has an average display and an intrusive UI. The design is rather uninspiring, but the rear camera is above average. It also offers decent battery life. It’s a bold attempt by the company, but in all honesty, we can’t really recommend this over phones like the Moto G5 Plus or Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. Both of these devices offer better value for money.. Lava Z25 (Gold, 32 GB)(4 GB RAM). Moto C Plus (Pearl White, 16.... Redmi Y1 (Gold, 64GB).

Lava Z25 Review: Slightly Overpriced Smooth Operator. 5.5-inch (1280 x 720 pixels) HD 2.5D curved glass IPS display. Octa-Core MediaTek MT6750 64-bit processor clocked at 1.5 GHz, Mali T860 GPU. 4GB RAM, 32GB internal memory, expandable up to 128GB via microSD slot. Hybrid Dual SIM, 4G VoLTE, WiFi 802.11 b/g/n. Cellular Network, In-Call Audio, and Sim Slots. The Z25 is Lava’s attempt to win back lost ground in the mid-segment smartphone market. However, it has its task cut out in the face of some very stiff competition from spec heavy and price light competitors, mainly from China. Can the Z25 hold its own against them? We look at various aspects of the phone to find out if it is actually ready to compete in the market.. The Z25 delivered quality experience throughout our usage. We really loved the ergonomics, the curves, and the build quality. It does resemble the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 a lot, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. While the Z25 does not do anything out of the ordinary, anybody buying this phone should have no complaints in this department. The front display has 2.5D curved glass which makes the swiping experience awesome.. Coming back to the technical part, the handset features a Series 5 metal back cover, premium chrome lining, and diamond cut finish providing a premium aesthetic that the price tag demands. The phone is hand polished for complete uniformity which you will love. The weight of the phone is 163 grams, and it does not feel heavy.. The Z25 comes with a 5.5-inch HD (720p) 2.5D curved glass IPS display with Oleophobic coating and just 2 mm bezels on both sides. At this price range, we did expect the phone to come with a 1080P display, but the overall experience was not bad. The display is pretty bright even in sunlight and the oleophobic coating made sure that your touch experience is not spoiled. We tested the phone in a city which has 90 percent humidity in summer, and you can trust us when we say the oleophobic coating does work.. However, we found the ambient sensor to be slower than normal. Taking the phone out of the pocket in sunlight to brightening up the screen took almost 10 seconds which is bad and noticeable. The wide angle view and daylight readability, though, is much better than some of the phones we have used at this price range.. The technical specifications of the Z25 are as follows:. If we have to put in simple words, the performance is fantastic. We were surprised that even though powered by the good old MediaTek MT6750 64-bit octa-core processor clocked at 1.5 GHz, the Z25 which runs on Android 6.0 with Lava’s Star OS, delivered a decent performance.. App switching is very fast, and so are the first time launches. As a matter of fact, when we compared this phone with the Oppo A57, with 21 apps, the Lava Z25 takes down Oppo by 50 seconds, which is a noticeable difference. The fingerprint sensor is definitely fast. While Lava claims to be the fastest in the industry, the difference is clear when you take a couple of selfies shot one after the other.. The speakers which are located at the bottom edge are, however, disappointing. The audio is not clear to deliver quality music, and it just sounds bad when put on high volume. Not what the music lovers ordered.. The Lava Z25 houses a 13-megapixel f2.0 aperture rear camera with single LED flash. It uses the Sony IMX258 Exmor RS sensor (5 layer lens) with Bluelight Filter and PDAF technology. The camera software offers features like Bokeh, Night Pro, HDR, Panorama, Wide Selfie, and GIF mode.. Lava has put in a lot of effort in the camera, and the results speak for themselves.. The picture quality is up to the mark. The color tones are neutral, the skin tone came out close to actual (Lava has done software optimization for this specifically), and the bokeh is impressive. As a matter of fact, you also get these features in the Z10 as well. There is no lag between shots. We would give 8/10 for the quality.. The camera struggles to focus a little even with PDAF. Most of the time we had to manually set the focus, and the pictures have grains in the final result. We would give 4/10 for the quality in low light.. This is one place where we all love to click pictures. With decent lights at home, the pictures came out good. We would rate it 7/10 for quality.. The front camera in Z25 is of 8 megapixels with LED flash and f/2.0 aperture. The selfie does offer great detail in the picture, with balanced color tones. In broad daylight, it is just fantastic, but for low light, it has the same issue as the rear camera – it is not bad but it’s far from perfect. We would give 4/10 for the quality in low light, and 7/10 in daylight.. Both the front and rear flash of the Lava Z25 support spotlight mode i.e. it stays on when taking selfies or normal pictures. This definitely helps when you are really low on light. However, the front flash does hurt eyes if you take pictures in a row.. Have a look at the pictures below to decide yourself.. With its own Start OS version 3.3 on top of Android 6.0, the Z25’s customization are at a bare minimum. The UI is more like a theme on stock Android, and it performs well without lag or slow animations. This also means that there are many features missing because the OS is still on the previous version. One of UI implementations we did not like is that of the multitasking button – it opens the menu, and there is no way to change it. Only a long press on the menu button will get you an option to switch between apps. This is super old school and Lava is stuck in it.. We tested the phone with Asphalt 8, that too on high settings. The performance was not an issue on the phone, nor was the heating. The phone did warm up a little after 45 minutes of gameplay, but that is acceptable. The colors were oversaturated, but there were no frame skips. The transition between Car crash, in-video, and resume back to the game was seamless. This was a bit of surprise to us as the Mediatek Processor and GPU combination do not have a great reputation, but we guess it worked pretty well here. Other games like Candy Crush and Clash of Clans also worked well.. We tested the phone in two conditions – when we were in town, and when on roaming. Surprisingly, the phone has an excellent battery life. The 3020 mAh battery survived for a full day of roaming with three hours of Talk time, WhatsApp and Facebook Usage. On my home network, the phone lasted for 18 hours plus with heavy gaming, a lot of camera shots and other usages.. We have made a number of calls on this phone. The experience was smooth and in-call audio was spot on. However, over speaker, things get disappointing. The phone houses a hybrid SIM slot which means you can either have two SIMs or one SIM and one MicroSD card. Even though it has 32 GB of internal storage, many dual SIM users who store all their data on SD card would want to skip this. The Z25 supports VoLTE and has all the Jio apps pre-installed.. Despite being run-of-the-mill design, the phone is ergonomic and build quality is top notch. The overall performance (including multi-tasking and gaming) is very good and the camera is above average as well. Except for the ancient 720P display, we really did not have any major complaints on the hardware side. One of the biggest drawbacks of the phone is that it is still powered by Android 6.0. Most of the phones in the market have started getting the Android 7.0 update, and new phones are coming with it installed. And the fact is that there are competitive phones in the market which offer great value at a lesser price, like the Redmi Note 4, Honor 6X, Moto G5 Plus and others. Lava’s decision to slap a higher price tag of Rs 18,000 (with actual selling price around Rs 16,500) to compete only in the offline market is unlikely to work in the long term..

Lava Z25 First Impressions: 'Flagship device' may face some serious challenges. Updated: Thursday, March 23, 2017, 10:58 [IST]. Design Display Hardware Software Camera Battery and Connectivity Verdict. Lava Z25 has been announced today along with the Z10. These phones are priced at Rs. The Z25 will be available from today.. Lava has announced the Z25 in Champagne Gold and Gray color options. The device is priced in the mid-range segment, making it more expensive than some of the bestsellers in the market.. There are a few impressive features in this phone, but we are skeptical when it comes to the success of it in the already obsessed smartphone market. Here is our first impressions of the Lava Z25. Check it out to know more.. These days, most smartphones in the entry-level and mid-range market have a similar design language. The Lava phone has nothing new in terms of design. It reminds us of Xiaomi phones when it comes to its rear panel.. There is a fingerprint scanner at the rear positioned just like the one we have seen on Xiaomi phones.. The smartphone weighs in at 163 grams and measures 8.5mm in thickness. The device has a unibody metal design that means the battery is non-removable. With this kind of a design, we can say that the device has a decent build quality and premium looks for a mid-range Android phone.. The Lava Z25 is fitted with a 5.5-inch IPS display with HD 1280 x 720 pixel resolution. This results in an average pixel density of 267 ppi, which is nowhere near the industry standard. The screen is quite responsive and smooth in our hands-on. Also, it is bright enough when used under direct sunlight.. We will give you more details about the display in our complete review of the phone in the coming weeks.. The Lava phone is equipped with a 64-bit 1.5GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6750 processor paired with Mali-T860 GPU and 4GB RAM. With such a huge chunk of RAM, the Lava Z25 can handle multitasking in a decent way. Even the graphic performance will be impressive with the Mali-T860 graphics unit.. The Lava Z25 is bundled with 32GB of default memory capacity. This storage can be expanded up to 128GB based on the requirement. We need to mention that there is support for Hybrid SIM card slot that doubles the second SIM slot into a micro SD card slot on need basis.. Lava Z25 and Z10 with 4G VoLTE launched in India, prices start from Rs. During our hands-on, we found this device to be responsive and smooth without any lags. Needless to say, it is too early to give a feedback about the capabilities of this phone.. The Lava phone has been launched with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which is over a year old. This platform is based on the Star OS 3.3. Lava's Star OS is quite similar to the skins seen in some Chinese smartphones.. It is somewhat similar to the MIUI as well. The device doesn't come with many pre-installed apps that occupy the precious internal storage capacity. Also, it supports up to 11 Indian languages.. On the imaging front, Lava Z25 makes use of a 13MP rear camera snapper with LED flash, Sony IMX258 Exmor RS sensor, PDAF, and f/2.0 aperture. This sensor supports FHD 1080p video recording as well.. Like many other phones in the mid-range market, this one too has features such as Night Pro, Continue Shot, Bokeh, Extreme Beauty, and Beauty-fi. Up front, there is an 8MP selfie camera with LED flash and f/2.0 aperture.. The camera is a decent performer. It may not be the best camera phone in its category, but not bad too. However, the low-light performance lags behind in the competition with other phones. We will come up with more details on the camera performance later in our review.. Lava Z25 comes with connectivity features such as 4G VoLTE, dual-SIM support, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi, and 3.5mm audio jack. Though both the SIM cards support 4G, you can use 4G only on one SIM at a time.. There is a fingerprint sensor at the rear, below the main camera, on the Lava Z25. This fingerprint sensor can unlock the phone in 0.16 seconds. It is possible to register up to five fingerprints and it serves other purposes such as capturing selfies.. The smartphones get the power from a 3050mAh battery that comes with the power saver mode to minimize the power consumption and enhance the battery life.. Lava Z25 is a good attempt, but we feel that the company should have attempted to bring some design changes. At a point in time when the competition is at its peak, the company has released a Rs. 16,990-priced phone that is definitely not the best one in the block.. There are phones such as Moto G5 Plus, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, etc. that render a better performance at a lesser price tag. Anyways, we will give a final verdict after the detailed review..
