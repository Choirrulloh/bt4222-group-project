Lava A59 is pretty good handset for less than 4K. It carries all the useful features like 3G support, fine camera quality, dual SIM, android 5.1 and extensive memory. I think for just 3500 bucks features are enough to keep the user contended.. 17 Jun 2016 By Flipkart Customer On flipkart.com. Good phone at a low budget. I was quite surprised to see that this phone has good features even though priced very affordably. Perfect for first time smartphone users! PIP video feature and smart music feature is quite impressive. At such a low price this phone has 5 MP primary camera is something I didn’t expect. Wish the battery life was a little more, but never mind it is a good phone at a low budget.. Lava A59 with 4.5-inch display and selfie flash launched for Rs 4,199. May 27 2016 By Akshay Kumar.
