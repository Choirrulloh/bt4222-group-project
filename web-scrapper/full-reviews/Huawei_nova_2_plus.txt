Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Octa-core, 2360 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. A mid-ranged phone with a huge selfie camera. The Nova 2 Plus has a premium design and costs less than what you’d expect. It’s great at beautifying your selfies and audio output. Where it doesn't impress is with the dual back cameras and gaming performance.. Less is more Design and display Subtle and elegant design. The original Huawei Nova Plus was decent but not necessary a memorable phone. With the follow up, Huawei is focusing on the front camera and audio capabilities.. At AED 1,399 (US$375), the Huawei Nova 2 Plus is cheaper than the likes of Honor 9 , but it's also not at the same performance level as that or the Nokia 8 .. Packaged in a white box that looks very much like the one we saw on the Honor 8 last year, the Nova 2 Plus comes with a fast charger, a USB Type C cable and a headset along with the quickstart guide.. Like other Huawei phones we’ve reviewed of late, a translucent case is also bundled to protect the phone. We think it’s great that Huawei is providing basic protection out of the box.. The Huawei Nova 2 Plus can be seen as a cheaper version of the Huawei P10 Plus. It has almost identical dimensions and a slightly less premium, yet, a beautiful design.. Instead of the glass strip found on the top of P10 Plus with Leica brand, the Nova 2 plus has a smooth all-metal back.. It’s available in three colors- Graphite Black, Prestige Gold and Aurora Blue. We got that last one for review and it has a nice zen like finish that is achieved by moving the antennae lines on the top and bottom.. 153.9 x 74.5 x 6.9mm OS : Android 7.0 Screen size : 5.5-inch Resolution : 1080 x 1920 CPU : HiSilicon Kirin 659 RAM : 4GB Storage : 64GB Battery : 3340mAh Rear camera : Dual 12 + 8 MP Front camera : 20MP. Even though the screen size is 5.5 inches, the Huawei Nova 2 Plus sits comfortably in your hand. And with a weight of 169g, it's easier to handle than other phones with similar screen sizes.. Huawei has placed the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone. Although we prefer a fingerprint sensor on the front, the positioning of it on the Nova 2 is well thought out. It sits reasonably below the cameras and in the center making it very easy for your index finger to reach it.. Like the Huawei P10 , the fingerprint sensor is extremely quick to recognize and unlock your phone - among the fastest we've used. It also allows for gestures such as pulling down the notification shade or browsing your photos. You can even answer calls and take photos by tapping it.. The 5.5-inch screen on the Huawei Nova 2 Plus is FullHD in resolution which is expected from a device at its price point. It's LED in technology and is bright enough to be used in the outdoor sun, though you will need to crank the brightness levels all the way up when using it outdoors in a place like Dubai. Huawei has also done a good job with colour reproduction, especially when you use one of the bundled theme that brings out the best the screen has to offer.. While the Huawei Nova 2 Plus has an elegant design, it won't necessarily turn heads. It's definitely more premium than what is expected out of a phone in it's price range, but it's a phone that will disappear among all other phones that look like it.. At just 6.9mm thickness, the phone sits comfortably in your hands and is easier to use that other phones with a similar screen size. Although there are bezels present on the top and bottom, they don't feel oversized though most of us will need to use the phone with two hands.. The left side holds the SIM tray which can take one nano SIM and one micro SIM, or a MicroSD card. On the right, you can find a textured power button was well as volume keys that are easy to reach. Moving to the bottom, the Nova 2 Plus features a USB Type-C port along with a 3.5mm jack.. The back holds the dual camera setup along with a flash on the top and the fingerprint sensor below it to the centre. The front of the phone is very generic- a large glass slab with noticeable bezels on the top and the bottom.. Next Page What's it like to use?.

Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Octa-core, 2360 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. FCC ID value: QISBAC-LX3 link. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Interface and reliability Android 7.0 with EMUI 5.1 Huawei's custom UI is well polished Movies, music and gaming Great audio hardware Can't handle demanding games Specs and benchmark performance Good overall performance Kirin 659 isn't meant for high-end performance. The Huawei Nova 2 Plus runs Android 7.0 Nougat, with Huawei's own Emotion UI (EMUI) 5.1 layered on top. While we weren't expecting the phone to run Android 8 Oreo, we were surprised to see it not equipped with Android 7.1 which is found on most new phones.. Instead you have to make do with Android 7.0. It's not a deal breaker, but it's a shame it's not more up to date. We're also not satisfied with Huawei's lack of software updates for its previous phones released in the Middle East.. That being said, you do get the latest version of EMUI which is 5.1 and was released with the Huawei P10 earlier in the year. It's quite a departure from stock Android which can be a good thing in making your product stand out.. Although previous version of EMUI (4.x and below) haven't necessarily been great, Huawei stepped up with EMUI 5.0 that was launched with the Huawei Mate 9 last year and then tweaked it further with the launch of the P10 and EMUI 5.1.. In some ways, EMUI reminds me a bit of iOS which could be a good thing for some users- especially the ones that have used an iPhone in the past. That being said, that's just how it looks by default and Huawei allows for lots of customization.. For instance, you can chose between having all your apps appear on the home screen or have an app drawer instead with only a few of you most used apps and widgets taking up home screen space. You can also change themes and icons through the Huawei themes app.. The UI itself is very smooth to navigate. You can easily switch between apps or scroll through long lists and web pages without noticing any stutter. Huawei's decision to equip the Nova 2 Plus with 4GB RAM really helps with that,. Where we do have an issue with Huawei devices is with updates, or the lack of them in the Middle East. While other parts of the world get newer builds from Huawei frequently, Middle East units lag severely behind and, judging from previous experience, you'd be lucky to get any updates on the Nova 2 Plus.. Huawei has a dedicated video player app for watching videos stored on the device such as the ones created using the camera or on your built-in storage/SD card. It's a clear and functional app that also offers the ability to watch videos in a window layered over the home screen, allowing you to navigate and open apps in the background.. One of the key aspects of the Nova 2 Plus is Huawei's decision to adopt the AK4376a HiFi chips along with HUAWEI 2012 lab’s unique audio algorithm called Huawei Histen.. These technologies help minimize distortion and other disturbances with audio processing to keep music clean, crisp and true. The Nova 2 Plus also supports aptX wireless Bluetooth technology for lower latency.. Huawei has also worked with Rainer Maillard, a Grammy award-winning musician for mixing the device’s key sounds.. Needless to say, but you will need a good pair of headphones to enjoy audio at it's fullest on the Nova 2 Pro. The lonesome bottom-mounted speaker to the right of the USB-C port is reasonably loud and produces better audio than many phones, but doesn't do justice to what the phone is capable of. Neither does the generic bundles pair of earphones.. Huawei has its own Music app that allows you to play music stored on the device but there really isn't much reason to use this over apps such as Anghami, Google Play Music or even Apple Music that allow you to stream music.. In fact, we're a bit surprised that Huawei didn't partner up with the likes of Anghami in the region considering the strong focus on the audio capabilities of the Nova 2 Pro.. While audio is a great selling point for the Huawei Nova 2 Plus, it isn't necessarily well equipped to tackle the demands of the latest games. The Kirin 659 chipset is good for casual and less demanding games, but newer games don't run as smoothly and we noticed frame drops as well as sluggish response to controls.. The Nova 2 Plus also got noticeably warm when playing high-end games and running benchmarks, but not to the point of being uncomfortable to hold. If you want a phone that plays demanding games, you're better off buying something else.. Expectedly, the Huawei Nova 2 Plus doesn't come equipped with the company's flagship CPU which is the Kirin 960 that is reserved for the likes of the Huawei Mate 9 and the Huawei P10 Plus .. Instead, the phone runs on the mid-end Kirin 659 which offers performance levels of the Snapdragon 625- the same CPU found on the first generation of the the Huawei Nova .. The chipset is tuned more for general performance and coupled with 4GB RAM, that is evident by the smooth UI experience on using the phone. However when pushed with demanding apps and games, the CPU struggles to keep up.. The Nova 2 Plus's average Geekbench multicore benchmark score of 3,258 is barely higher that the previous generation of Nova which scored 3,105 with it's Snapdragon 625 CPU. It's also quite a bit lower than the Kirin 960 that averages over 6,600 in Geekbench.. Prev Page Introduction and design. Next Page Battery life and camera.

Home Mobile Phones & Tablets Review: Huawei nova 2 Plus. Moving away from its high-end devices, Huawei has recently released its latest mid-range smartphone, the Huawei nova 2 Plus. Design-wise, the nova 2 Plus borrows elements from the honor 8 Pro as well as the P10. The metallic unibody comes with a matte finish, making it great to have in your hands while the indent of the fingerprint sensor at the rear a lot shallower compared to other devices. There’s also very little Huawei branding aside from its logo located at the rear of the device at the bottom.. While the P10 boasted dual Leica cameras and the honor 8 Pro focused on mobile gaming, the nova 2 Plus is just your everyday mid-range smartphone. Not necessarily a good or bad thing, the nova 2 Plus stands out by not standing out (if that makes any sense.) With no outstanding features, that also implies that it wouldn’t cost an arm and a leg, which is what many consumers are looking at. You also get 128GB of internal storage space, making a microSD card useless.. Using the nova 2 Plus daily brought out a great experience overall. The Kirin 659 processor had a quick step to it without any sort of delay and lag, partially thanks to the 4GB of RAM. The EMUI 5.1 OS was modelled after Android Nougat 7.0 and contained very minimal bloatware, which was a nice touch. Multitasking between day-to-day social media stalking activities like Facebook and Instagram soaked up very little of the 3,340mAh battery capacity and even when streaming videos, it still holds itself up well. Like other smartphones, it heats up rather quickly when watching videos or using the camera for long periods.. Selling itself – that came out wrong – as Huawei’s best selfie smartphone, the nova 2 Plus comes with a 20-megapixel front-facing shooter. It’s dual rear cameras carry a 12-megapixel wide-angle lens alongside the 8-megapixel long-focus lens with f/1.8. For the sake of your eyes and the review, I will keep all selfies out of it. With or without the skin enhancement features, the front-facing camera made me look way too translucent and pale (I looked like a badly rendered version of IT.). At RM1,999, you can’t expect greatness. For that price, the rear cameras are more than capable at keeping the Likes flowing in on your Instagram. Colours reproduction is adequate with sufficient lighting although the pictures captured were in the middle of the night. You can also adjust the level of bokeh in real-time, taking you one step closer to being an ‘influencer’.. The Huawei nova 2 Plus is a great everyday smartphone if you’re looking something that is somewhat affordable and doesn’t die on you easily.. 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited - 12,265. 3D Mark Ice Storm Extreme - 8,093.

Huawei Nova 2 Plus: Our first take. Huawei’s Nova 2 Plus needs more than a pretty face to stand out from the crowd. The Huawei Nova 2 Plus does everything right, but doesn’t go the extra mile to stand out against some tough competition.. The Huawei Nova 2 Plus does everything right, but doesn’t go the extra mile to stand out against some tough competition.. The Huawei Nova 2 Plus does everything right, but doesn’t go the extra mile to stand out against some tough competition.. Dual-lens camera with fun Moving Picture mode. Stiff competition from Honor, and other brands. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Huawei launched the Nova series. at the end of 2016, and marketed them as phones for fashionable folk, who wanted a slim device with a great camera to slip into skinny jeans. It hasn’t taken such a bullish approach with the newly-announced sequels, that have arrived far earlier than usual in the smartphone industry.. The Nova 2 and Nova 2 Plus have been revealed for China, and a wider international launch hasn’t been confirmed yet. We managed to get some time with the Nova 2 Plus in China, to see how it stacks up against the first Nova phones.. There’s a lot to like about the Nova 2 Plus. The metal body has a pleasing grain to the finish, and comes in either a great-looking black, green, or blue — we’d go for the latter. The style draws plenty of influence from the Huawei P10 , with antenna bands blending into the body, minimal branding, and a dual-lens camera at the top. In turn, this means the style is also reminiscent of Apple’s iPhone.. The fingerprint sensor is on the back of the phone, rather than in the home button, and it only weighs 169 grams, so it’s very lightweight. At 6.9mm, it’s one of the thinnest phones you can buy.. The Nova 2 Plus is a mid-range phone. It has a 5.5-inch screen with a piece of 2.5D curved glass over the top, and a 1,920 × 1,080 pixel resolution. A Huawei-made Kirin 659 processor with 4GB of RAM powers the phone, a shift away from the Qualcomm Snapdragon chips used in the first Nova phones. The Nova 2 has a smaller 5-inch screen, is even lighter at 143 grams, and has a smaller 2,950mAh battery compared to the Nova 2 Plus’s 3,340mAh cell. The Nova 2 Plus comes with a hefty 128GB of internal storage space.. Performance in our brief hands-on time was great. It slid through the menus and in and out of apps without a problem, just as you’d expect. We doubt anyone will miss not having a Snapdragon processor inside, especially as the faster Kirin 960 chip has been such a winner in the P10. The Moving Picture feature is fun, and opens up some interesting creative opportunities.. Android 7.0 Nougat is installed with Huawei’s EMUI 5.1 user interface over the top — we like EMUI 5.1, but the Chinese version we tried was filled with bloatware. However, the app drawer can be activated, there are algorithms working to keep the software running quickly over the lifetime of the device, and it’s considerably more user-friendly than previous versions.. Dual-lens cameras are a Huawei trademark, and they’re present on both the Nova 2 and the Nova 2 Plus. We tried the camera — which has a 12-megapixel and an 8-megapixel lens — indoors, so the results were never going to be astounding, but the software is typically simple to use, and the operation is fast. There’s an added mode we haven’t seen before called Moving Picture, and it’s similar to Apple’s Live Photos mode. A short video is captured when you tap the shutter release, and it works like a GIF. Press on the screen in the gallery, and it animates. The Moving Picture feature is fun, and opens up some interesting creative opportunities; but it’s likely to suffer from the same problem as Live Photos — there’s nowhere to share them natively. The 20-megapixel selfie camera captured great images, but the small sensor didn’t enjoy challenging light conditions. Despite the many megapixels, don’t expect amazing results.. When you pick up a Nova 2 phone, it becomes clear why Huawei hasn’t rushed to sell them internationally yet. It’s because of the Honor brand, a tech-sharing spin-off that makes excellent phones that don’t cost very much. The 5.5-inch Nova 2 Plus costs the equivalent of $425. That’s a lot more than the Honor 6X , which offers a similar specification sheet. It also shares a visual resemblance to the Honor 8 Pro , which has a far more powerful internals for only a little more money.. This is the same problem Huawei faced with the first Nova. The $300 to $500 smartphone market is absolutely stuffed with strong phones, so competition is really stiff. In China, it’s perhaps even tougher, with solid options like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X. costing half of the Huawei phone. The Nova 2 Plus looks and feels the part, and it operated well in our time with the phone, plus the camera should impress on a longer test given Huawei’s prowess in this area. But there’s nothing here that makes the Nova 2 Plus stand out.. Huawei Nova 2 Plus Compared To. Add Us To Your Social Channels.
