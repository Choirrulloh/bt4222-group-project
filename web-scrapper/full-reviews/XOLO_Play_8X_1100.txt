HATS OFF TO YOU XOLO THE BEST GRAPHICS AND PROCESSING PHONE EVER I USED SAMSUNG NOKIA HTC AND XPERIA BUT LITTLE COMPLAINT AND ONE REQUEST A STUCK WITH THE POWER BUTTON AND WHY U GUYS GIVE A GLASS BODY TO THIS INSTEAD OF PLAY 8X 1000.

First of all,i want to thanx the brand XOLO,who has already proved the excellence of quality build from the other of its class like ,xiaomi,gionee ,micromax and other makers.Now I am coming to the point...the first thing you will be totally impressed about this phone is the super cool display with gorilla glass protection.Super fast performance.The Apps and the graphic intensive games are running without a little lag. The camera performance is stunning both front and rear.Any body will be astonished how an Indian company(though parts imported from china like all brands) is making this superb phone in this price range.. the only cons is battery.But now we have power banks,so this is not an issue at all.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. By Pranoy Bej | 1 Sep 2014. XOLO a subsidiary of LAVA trying to catch eyes of gamer with gratuitously new mobile named as XOLO Play-Zone aka 8X-1100 with a budget price of 14999. Xolo combined some ideas to this edition of Play mobile. The key specification of this mobile is ANdroid Kitkat(4.4), 720p display, 5.0" IPS LCD screen with 16M colours, 1.7GHz true octa-core processor, 2GB of RAM and 16GB internal space. The phone provide premium look so if you want a phone with cool look then it might be the one you looking for.. XOLO offers a 5" IPS LCD screen with 720p display with contrast ratio of 294ppi. XOLO put the ambient light sensor for better contrast in viewing under the daylight/outdoor. It also offers CORNING GORILLA GLASS 3 for protection. According to me this is quite good for this range of phones.. The user interface will be based on XOLO's newfangled HIVE UI according to the preliminary specification.The HIVE UI offers some decent look and some unparalleled experience in terms of customization. If it comes with HIVE UI then it good for premium look but takes lot of resources.. The processor of this model is powered by mediatech true-octa core series processor clocked a 1.7GHZ along with 2GB DDR2 RAM which is as good as to play heavy games like NFS, Modern Combat, Asphalt 8:heat. To turn the heat on to the games it offers the latest MALI-450MP4 GPu clocked at 700MHZ. In addition to that 6-axis motion sensing gyroscope sensor is put for smoother 3D gaming experience. The primary camera is filing as 13 MP AF rear camera with high sensitivity Sony Exmor RS™ Sensor which is a successor of Exmor R sensor with sensitivity upgrade. 5 MP front camera with BSI Sensor & 88 degree wide view angle is included as the secondary camera. The rear camera is capable of taking 1080p video and high quality HDR images.. The above listed details might pop up a question, is the battery last good? Xolo provide 2100mAh battery in it which is not the best but good and according to me it will last a day for average user and about 8hours for a gaming addicted or internet browsing. The heating problem is often reported from android phones and Google working on it to minimized. The Kitkat based phones heated less than the jelly bean one but the octa-core Mediatech processor may be a hurdle for XOLO to minimize the heat up. The phone fills comfortable in hand with stylish looks, decent camera feature, unparalleled gaming experience make the phone a Mid Range Master Class.. Was this review helpful?

Buy XOLO only if you are willing to be insulted by the crapiest of service center representatives. The company has no respect for its users, and it reflects in the fact that the website displays no contact information through which you could provide feedback about the extremely filthy and crappy treatment jutted out by their horrible service centers. Its not about the money going waste, its about the attitude of the staff. Nisha of Sai Communications, Laxio Nagar, New Delhi, who is a lady with a unique ability to use the chociest of abuses, or the service center at Noida who's phobe is never switched on. Buy only if you love to be insulted. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. Xolo Play 8X-1100 heats up and drains battery in few minutes. By Prasad Karnik | 5 May 2015. My Xolo - model Play 8X-1100, has been submitted for the third time for the same complaint of unusual heating of the handset on date 04.04.2015. Major problem of Motherboard replacement was carried out earlier & still the same problem of heating of handset is repeated. During this repairs following more problems are noticed,. Battery life has reduced considerable, which earlier showed more than 10 hours talk time has come down to 4 hours or so. ( 60% erosion in capacity due to battery heating with faulty circuit ). Wi-Fi connection drops and I have to make it ON again & again.. Screen touch response has slowed down and many times a character/alphabet next to the desired one appears on the text screen.. The said handset was purchase on 14.09.2014 and is in warranty period.. Considering above repeated problems I request the Xolo management to provide me a Brand New piece and end my agony of sending the handset for repairs again & again.. No revert from Xolo on above request.. After 27 days, company messaged me that phone is repaired and being sent to local service center in mumbai. Normal repair time is 15 days. I don't want to use faulty phone and seek justice from consumer forum.. Company is adamant & we don't get to talk to any xolo management team members. All are blocked at the call center.. Don't buy Xolo models as the company is insensitive towards the customers & keeps repairing the phones which are manufactured faulty. My phone so far has been with the company for more than 2 months for repairs on 3 occasions.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.

Xolo Play 8X-1100 Review: All Work and All Play. Ershad Kaleebullah , 29 October 2014. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Nostalgia hits us hard when we rewind a few years and think about Nokia's attempt to create a mobile phone that could double up as a portable console. The wonky designs notwithstanding, both the Nokia N-Gage and the N-Gage QD were really imaginative products, and we fondly remember sneaking in a few multiplayer FIFA matches between lectures in college. Moving forward, things have been changing. Smartphones have become several times more powerful, with bigger screens and better connectivity. The need to create separate devices for gaming has almost been eliminated.. Cut to 2014 and we see Xolo targeting the mobile gaming population with its Play lineup of smartphones. Their newest entrant in this series is the Play 8X-1100. Let's find out what makes it suitable for gaming, and what unique features it does or doesn't have.. Look and feel The Xolo Play 8X-1100 has a dual-tone body. The white rear panel is removable and does not cover the full length of the device. It ends abruptly in a black strip at the bottom. This black wraps around the edges a bit awkwardly and then starts running along sides and front. The front, meanwhile, has a white strip below the screen. This results in an unattractive chequerboard pattern. Xolo's effort might have been to create something unique in terms of looks, but the Play 8X-1100 has a design that just will not appeal to everyone. At least we do like the dotted style of the navigation buttons below the screen. Also, the backlighting on these buttons is even.. The 5-inch screen has Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. The phone itself measures 141.5x70.8x8.7mm, which makes it feel rather compact. Single-handed usage is not a hassle either. Above the screen you can find the front camera, notification LED and earpiece. The power button is on the right while the volume rocker sits on the left. The rear has the primary camera, flash, microphone for capturing sound in videos, and a loudspeaker grille. A Micro-USB port and another microphone for phone calls are on the bottom. The top edge has the 3.5mm audio jack for headphones.. Specifications and software The Play 8X-1100 has a pretty decent list of specifications for its price. Inside the body of the phone is an Mediatek MT6592 octa-core processor clocked at 1.7GHz, wich an integrated Mali-450 GPU. There is an ample 2GB of RAM and adequate 16GB of internal storage as well.O ne can add up to 32GB more storage space using a microSD card.The Xolo Play 8X-1100 also has USB On-the-Go support, which effectively allows even more storage space.. The phone supports dual SIM cards and works on the 850/900/1800/1900/2100MHz frequency bands. Connectivity includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0. The phone has a 13-megapixel rear camera with a Sony Exmor RS sensor and a 5-megapixel 88-degree wide-angle front camera. Apart from the standard accelerometer and proximity sensor, a gyroscope is also present which aids in some game controls. A 2100mAh battery powers the device.. The 5-inch screen has a resolution of 720x1280 pixels. It is an IPS LCD panel. The colours on this screen are slightly muted and we noticed a bluish tint on screens with lots of visible white. Even when viewed at very slight angles, we could immediately spot colours desaturating. You would need to crank up the brightness for the screen to be visible under direct sunlight.. The Play 8X-1100 runs nearly stock Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) and the inclusion of a few third-party apps is the only difference from devices like the Nexus 5. Xolo adds a Smart Gesture feature which basically lets users draw preset shapes to launch apps. It failed to work for us most of the time.. The only gaming related tweak is the presence of an app called Xolo Play Zone, which is basically a listing of several Gameloft titles. After an OTA update of around 20MB, we noticed that Modern Combat 4 and Spider-Man: Ultimate Power were installed. We felt this was too good to be true, and after firing up the games immediately realised that these were awful Java ports. What is even worse is the fact that these were trials, and Xolo wants to charge Rs. We suggest users stay away from this app and use the Google Play store instead.. Camera The primary camera on the Play 8X-1100 has Sony's Exmor RS sensor which is a staple in Xolo's high-end phones. We loved the performance of this sensor. The camera app is the stock Gingerbread one we've used before and it doesn't have any features worth mentioning.. In our daylight testing we noticed that apart from a green hue that occasionally set in with certain shots, details were typical of Sony sensors - crisp and warm, with natural colours. There was no barrel distortion either. We must make a mention of how quickly the lens refocused from shout to shot. It was almost as good as the performance of some highly-priced flagship smartphones.. Even the performance in low-light is really good. There is some noise that creeps in but it is not too drastic. The 5-megapixel front camera is almost as good as the one we saw in the HTC Desire 816 ( Review | Pictures ) and the Sony Xperia C3 Dual ( Review | Pictures ), which is saying a lot. It captured some really good selfies and we were almost tempted to post them on Instagram.. (click for full size) All is not hunky dory though, as the camera cannot capture good 1080p video. This could be because it uses the .3GP format which loses a lot of details in compression. As a result we ended up with video that had choppy framerates, issues with exposure detection, imbalanced colours, and overall loss of details.. Performance In daily use we found that the Play 8X-1100 was mostly zippy and there were no lags. After our mild disappointment with the Xolo Play Zone software, we got down to business and downloaded a few games including Dead Trigger 2, Asphalt 8 and Temple Run 2 to see how each of them performed. Temple Run 2 ran smoothly without any hiccups at all. In Dead Trigger 2, the graphics settings were set to low by default. We cranked things up and were pleasantly surprised to find that apart from occasional lags when tons of zombies swarm a particular area, the phone managed to hold up well. Asphalt 8 also ran without hiccups most of the time. However, please bear in mind that there is no special hardware in this phone to earn the special 'Xolo Play' branding, and we expect all phones with similar specs to perform just as well.. We ran our regular suite of benchmarks. In GFXbench the phone scored 14.3fps whereas in the more intensive 3D Mark Ice Storm test it managed a score of 6,674. These scores put the Play 8X-1100 within touching distance of the Asus Zenfone 5 ( Review | Pictures ), which has the best graphics benchmark results for devices under Rs. In AnTuTu and Quadrant, the phone scored, 30,092 and 13,898 respectively, which are both well above the scores of competing phones.. The phone played all the videos we threw at it just fine, including our heavily encoded 40mbps file. The audio quality, via both the bundled headset and in-built speakers, is not too great. The speaker doesn't get too loud and also crackles at high volumes. We found that the sound quality was really good.. The one area where Xolo could have done a bit more is the performance of the battery. It lasted us 5 hours and 25 minutes in our video loop test. This doesn't bode well for a phone that aims to be made for gamers, unless the company thinks its customers will be happy carrying external batteries around everywhere. Using the Xolo power app you can save some precious battery life, but don't expect the difference to be a lot.. Verdict The Xolo Play 8X-1100 is available for around Rs.14,000 online, which is a good price for a phone that performs so well. From playing games to capturing photographs, the 8X-1100 doesn't disappoint. However, it cannot capture good videos, the design is awkward, and the battery life is not too great. If you can look past these flaws then the Play 8X-1100 is not a bad investment. The alternatives to this phone are the Moto G (Gen 2) ( Review | Pictures ), Asus Zenfone 5, and HTC Desire 616 ( Review | Pictures ), which has recently received a price cut..

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 16 GB + MicroSD. Based on 1 User reviews. Low pixel density screen (294 ppi). The Xolo Play 8X-1100 is a powerful device with Android 4.4. Powered by a 1.7 GHz octa core processor, coupled with 2 GB RAM, it offers 16 GB native storage, microSD slot for extra memory, 13 MP camera on the back and a 5 MP one on the front.. Dimensions: 5.57 x 2.79 x 0.34 inches (141.5 x 70.8 x 8.7 mm). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor, Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3). Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Scenes. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 18.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 19.7 days (473 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 8.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 17.9 days (429 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Home Android Xolo Play 8X-1100 Quick Review, Price and Specs. Xolo Play 8X-1100 Quick Review, Price and Specs. Last updated Feb 12, 2018. 5 inch 1080p display (441ppi) with Gorilla Glass 3. Xolo is definitely trying to populate the market with its smartphones. They are trying to mimic the success that Samsung and Micromax had using the same strategy. (If you don’t agree, just look how many models Samsung and Micromax have at a given price segment). They recently launched three more models – Xolo Play 8X-1100, Q1000s Plus and Q700s Plus.. The Xolo Play 8X-1100 is a gaming focused handset with many gaming features. And it must be noted that it does not come with Xolo’s new HIVE UI that came with 8X-1000. We’ll do a quick review on the Xolo Play 8X-1100 with the Price, Specifications and Comparison.. Xolo Play 8X-1100 is powered by 1.7 Ghz Octa core MT6592 Mediatek processor. The graphics department is handled by the Mali 450 GPU. Also, the handset packs 2GB of RAM. This is a pretty powerful configuration which is proven and is used in many of the smartphones such as the Karbonn Titanium Octane, Micromax Canvas Knight, etc.. 1.7 GHz Octa Core MediaTek MT6592. 1.7 GHz Octa Core MediaTek MT6592. The battery unit on the Xolo Play 8X-1100 is 2100mAh, which is a little bit on the lower side. Considering the specifications, we highly doubt that the battery life will be pathetic as it has to power the full HD display and the octa-core processor. And note that this is intended to be a gaming handset, so this battery capacity is not upto the mark if you’re going to have long gaming sessions.. The primary camera unit is a 13MP Sony Exmor RS lens. It supports Full HD recording and has a faster auto focus. The camera performance is very good for day and night photography. Xolo also targets selfie lovers with this handset. 8X-1100 comes with a 5MP front camera, which has a BSI sensor and a wide angle lens providing wide selfies.(That’s cool!). List of Best 6GB RAM Smartphones Available Right Now to Buy. CONFIRMED: Xiaomi Launching Mi A1 Android One Phone on Sept 5 in India. List of all Phones Getting Lenovo Android Oreo 8.0 Update. Xolo Play 8X-1100 comes with 16GB of internal storage with expandable memory upto 32GB.. Xolo Play 8X-1100 features a 5-inch full HD display (1920×1080) which provides a resolution of 441ppi. It is pretty good in this price point. The screen is protected by Corning Gorilla glass 3.. The phone comes with Android KitKat 4.4.2, which is close to stock ROM. Xolo’s new HIVE UI is not included with this phone (even though its name is similar to the 8X-1000). They might bring the HIVE UI via software update though (No words by Xolo on that).. Xolo Play 8X-1100 features the Xolo Play Zone, which is supported by Gameloft and lists all of their successful games and many exclusive content. The handset also features dual speakers with DTS surround sound.. It has many competitors to fight with, such as the Xiaomi Mi3, Lenovo S660, Huawei Honor 3C, Titanium Octane, and even Xolo’s own 8X-1000. It does have very good specification set and a brilliant camera, which gives the phone an edge over the competition (It doesn’t count the Xiaomi Mi 3 though).. Overall, the handset provides pretty good value. It would be a better alternative than others if you didn’t get the chance to buy a Mi 3. Go for the Xolo Play 8X-1100 if you want stellar performance and a brilliant camera set (Primary and secondary – both are awesome!).. Xolo Play 8X-1100 Quick Review, Price and Specs.

Then i noticed that battery is draining faster after that the accessories they had given me were probably worst i could say firstly my charger was not charging my phone then my ear phone was also not working (probably i had not use them). Then i noticed that OTG was also not working. I had to charge this phone probably twice or even thrice in a day. When i played some casual game it started heating. It's camera does not look 13mp(even Motorola's. 8mp is better) but best part of phone is does not get leg and always 1 gb ram is free. all are mention in my summery.

HD display, akin to a lot of flagships from 2013. As you might have guessed already, the CPU running under the hood is the octa-core MediaTek MT6592, which is said to be the world’s first ‘true’ octa-core. A healthy 2GB of RAM complements the octa-core processor to add up to a respectable specs set.. The device comes with a price tag of 14,999 INR or roughly $250.. A lot of local makers have been forced to lower prices following the Mi 3 onslaught from Xiaomi, but the good thing here is that the consumer is the only winner here..

The phone is very well bosted with features such as Gorilla Glass 3, etc. Nice quality overall and good price for all these functions. The only thing to mind is that touch response is only okay. When touched very lightly the phone might miss to respond sometimes. Also, viewing angles are also good only and not very good.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time 18.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min) 24.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min).

FCC ID value: IHDT56QD1 link. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..
