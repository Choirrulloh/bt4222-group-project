I will give samsung 120Â if they let me to. pinku, 10 Dec 2017 Worst samsung phone. All J 2 (2016), J 2 (2017) are worst phone aver. more Even the 2016 model was better than this new one. I hope no one will buy this and production will be cancelled. The development costs would no longer exist and other, better phones would maybe get cheaper.. rest of the mobile companies making phones with higher specs with low prices and samsung doing this opposite, this not the era of using 1Gb ram phone with 5mp cam. if this will continue huawaii will be the cheapest brand in good spesc as huawaii introduce its Mate 10 lite in just 300USD.. All J 2 (2016), J 2 (2017) are worst phone aver. These SAMSUNG AMOLED Screen phones have some major screen problems. Samsung is repeating same thing in J series and prices are so high. People should look at Nokia, they provide more specs and built quality in same price.. This is the J200F for 2016 with nougat lol... This Device Spec Is Too Low For J Series In 2017. how many same phone siries samsung want come out with??10?20?lol. Anonymous, 17 Nov 2017 In the old days I never tought android was better then ios.

In the old days I never tought android was better then ios. But now I have decided is depends on the cell phone network mostly as the speed off internet depends on signal on the phone mostly. Technology will be changing all the time and costant different phones coming out all the time. So no phone is better then the other. That's for the customer to decide.

By Gene Ettison | 16 Sep 2017. I bought this phone in July of 2017, and while it serves its purpose, it is definitely not fast enough to compete with the other Samsung phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S6, S7 or the new S8. After 3 months of use, I find that it severely slows down after a couple of days without restarting it......possibly due to the extreme amount of bloatware in it. For the price though ($149.00), it's not entirely a bad phone. However, I would advise...if possible, to just save up until you're able to buy one of the more expensive ones. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 3 out of 3 people found this review helpful. By Naveen Kumar | 28 Dec 2017. Please let me know where I can buy this product? Everywhere ppl say this is not yet released.

First, I am an android fan and Samsung has never disappointed me...until NOW! This J7 has NO PROCESSING POWER. If I get a call or text while I am on fb or one of my other apps, I CANNOT ANSWER THE CALL BECAUSE THE SCREEN FREEZES. I have tried to return this device twice. Unfortunately I am paying monthly for it. I have never written a bad review for a product before. I am compelled to not have you deal with the same misery I am dealing with..
