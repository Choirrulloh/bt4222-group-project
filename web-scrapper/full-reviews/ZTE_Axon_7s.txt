The ZTE Axon 7s could turn out to be a killer flagship. The Axon 7s has a better processor and bigger battery than its predecessor. of the best smartphones of 2016. It’s high-end audio, speedy processor, and slick aluminum design. matched — and in many cases bested — the competition’s hardware. Now, it’s getting an upgrade in the form of the Axon 7s , an ever-so-slightly enhanced version of the Axon 7 designed to compete with new phones from LG and Samsung.. spiritual successor to the Axon 7 Max, a beefed-up version of the Axon 7 that featured a 4,100mAh battery, a Snapdragon 821, and 6GB of RAM.. There isn’t much to go on yet, but here’s everything we know about the Axon 7s so far.. If early renders of the Axon 7s are any indication, it won’t look radically different from the original. ZTE’s new flagship sports the same 2.5D curved, all-metal unbody as last year’s model, and retains the. front-firing stereo speakers, rear fingerprint sensor, and edge-to-edge screen.. There’s a notable addition on the rear, though: A 12MP Sony IMX368 sensor. Like the LG G6 and Huawei P10, the Axon 7s has a secondary camera lens that can handle wide-angle and low-light photography.. The Axon 7s’s internals aren’t all that radically different from the Axon 7’s. The screen is the same size (5.5 inches), and resolution (2,560 x 1,440 pixels), the primary camera (20MP with a f/1.8 aperture and 1.25µm pixels) and selfie sensor (8MP) haven’t changed, either. The Axon 7s packs Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 chip and Adreno 530 graphics, a slight step up from its predecessor’s processor (Snapdragon 820). It boasts 6GB of RAM, up from the Axon 7’s 4GB of RAM, and a 3,400mAh battery compatible with Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 technology. And it adds a MicroSD slot and compatibility with Google Daydream, Google’s mobile virtual reality platform.. In fact, one of the only areas that hasn’t. seen improvement is the Axon 7s’s software. ships with Android 6.0 Marshmallow on board, a version behind Android 7.0 Nougat, the newest. Luckily, ZTE says it’s upgradeable via a software update.. At just $500 for a 128GB model, the Axon 7s sounds like a worthy successor to the Axon 7. Unfortunately, it sounds like it won’t be all that easy to get.. For now, it’s only available for government use in China. It’s specifically targeted at security-conscious officials, shipping with encryption and tools designed to prevent unauthorized tracking, data mining, and other forms of digital malfeasance.. But there’s a chance it’ll become broadly available later on. If and when the Axon 7s goes on sale outside of China,. we’ll update this post with pricing and availability details..

Jules Wang April 19, 2017 12:02 am. ZTE’s balance sheet has come out in the positive for the first quarter of 2017, but the status of its mobile division is in question after 3,000 layoffs were announced. So, what are we to make of its innovations?. Not terribly much at this stage. It introduced the Axon 7s as a slightly modified follow-on from the. Axon 7 Max , which itself was a follow-on from the Axon 7. — speaking of which, a juiced-up version of the Max was also introduced. While the regular Max used a conservative Snapdragon 625, the advanced variant (known as the “Industry Edition”) as well as the new 7s have the Snapdragon 821 and a 4,100mAh battery.. We figure that the screen sizes will differ between the two, but that’s not explicitly told in the press release for the phones.. Unfortunately for any general consumers, the phones are only being sold to the Chinese government and are enriched with encryption measures and security tools with certification upon certification to prove that its so darn safe.. You might want to consider something else the regular Axon 7 again at this point. Newegg is selling the 64GB phone on its eBay channel at $329.99 — $69.99 off — with free shipping..

It’s high-end audio, speedy processor, and slick aluminum design. matched — and in many cases bested — the competition’s hardware. Now, it’s getting an upgrade in the form of the Axon 7s , an ever-so-slightly enhanced version of the Axon 7 designed to compete with new phones from LG and Samsung.. spiritual successor to the Axon 7 Max, a beefed-up version of the Axon 7 that featured a 4,100mAh battery, a Snapdragon 821, and 6GB of RAM.. There isn’t much to go on yet, but here’s everything we know about the Axon 7s so far.. If early renders of the Axon 7s are any indication, it won’t look radically different from the original. ZTE’s new flagship sports the same 2.5D curved, all-metal unbody as last year’s model, and retains the. front-firing stereo speakers, rear fingerprint sensor, and edge-to-edge screen.. There’s a notable addition on the rear, though: A 12MP Sony IMX368 sensor. Like the LG G6 and Huawei P10, the Axon 7s has a secondary camera lens that can handle wide-angle and low-light photography.. The Axon 7s’s internals aren’t all that radically different from the Axon 7’s. The screen is the same size (5.5 inches), and resolution (2,560 x 1,440 pixels), the primary camera (20MP with a f/1.8 aperture and 1.25µm pixels) and selfie sensor (8MP) haven’t changed, either. The Axon 7s packs Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 chip and Adreno 530 graphics, a slight step up from its predecessor’s processor (Snapdragon 820). It boasts 6GB of RAM, up from the Axon 7’s 4GB of RAM, and a 3,400mAh battery compatible with Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 technology. And it adds a MicroSD slot and compatibility with Google Daydream, Google’s mobile virtual reality platform.. In fact, one of the only areas that hasn’t. seen improvement is the Axon 7s’s software. ships with Android 6.0 Marshmallow on board, a version behind Android 7.0 Nougat, the newest.

For now, it’s only available for government use in China. It’s specifically targeted at security-conscious officials, shipping with encryption and tools designed to prevent unauthorized tracking, data mining, and other forms of digital malfeasance..

ZTE Axon 7s Now Available In China, It Costs $675. June 19, 2017 - Written By Mark Real. The successor to last year’s well-received ZTE Axon 7, the ZTE Axon 7s, is now hitting the stores in China. ZTE announced the device last April but the Chinese electronics company did not provide much information about the handset. The company decided to keep most of the features of last year’s flagship and then introduce some minor spec bumps to produce the ZTE Axon 7s. However, there are still some key changes implemented by the Chinese electronics firm to differentiate the two smartphones. One of the few things that should set the two devices apart at first glance is the presence of a dual rear camera setup. The rear cameras are equipped with one 20-megapixel Sony IMX350 sensor and one 12-megapixel Sony IMX368 sensor. In contrast, the device’s predecessor only had a single rear camera which is equipped with a 20-megapixel sensor.. Aside from the changes made to the smartphone’s camera, the ZTE Axon 7s had some minor improvements in the internal hardware compared to its predecessor. One of the key changes made to the internal hardware of the ZTE Axon 7s is the upgrade of the device’s chipset to the Snapdragon 821. While it is not the latest flagship chipset offering from Qualcomm, it is still powerful enough to deliver high frame rates in games and reduce lag in the device’s user interface. The device’s internal storage has also been upgraded from the predecessor’s 64GB of storage to a much more spacious 128GB. There is also a slight increase in the battery capacity, with the ZTE Axon 7s now sporting a 3,400mAh battery.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. While some of the internal specifications saw minor spec bumps, ZTE decided to keep using some of the last year’s hardware for the ZTE Axon 7s. The hardware used for the display and the front-facing camera of the ZTE Axon 7s is likely similar to what was used in its predecessor. More specifcally, the ZTE Axon 7s is equipped with a 5.5-inch QuadHD display and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. The device is also equipped with 4GB of RAM, which is the same capacity offered in last year’s ZTE Axon 7. Despite the relatively minor spec bumps introduced by ZTE to its newest flagship offering, the manufacturer decided to substantially increase the launch price of the ZTE Axon 7s. While the ZTE Axon 7 launched at $400, the ZTE Axon 7s is now available in China for 4599 Yuan or $675.. Moto C Plus Is Now Official In India With A 4,000mAh Battery.

I have had the enhanced 6/128 version since the phones release.

ZTE Axon 7s: release date, price, buy. Last year, on May 26, the Chinese manufacturer ZTE introduced its new flagship smartphone called ZTE. The device was very successful, because it was based on powerful processor Snapdragon 820, received 4 or 6 GB of RAM and up to 128 GB of user memory.. No less important was the presence of stereo speakers, which sounded great thanks to the sound amplifier from Asahi Kasei Microdevices.. After that ZTE released two more versions of the flagship with more simplified hardware for the masses.. They called Axon 7 mini and Axon 7 Max.. The first one received very modest specs and weak battery, but the second one had 6-inch screen and high-price.. Anyway, the success of Axon 7 allowed the smartphone manufacturer to continue phone series. This year we already saw new smartphone Axon 7 with Snapdragon 821 processor. Yes, this processor is not the latest, although it is very powerful. The same LG G6 runs on a similar chipset.. To be honest, there are few cardinal changes in ZTE Axon 7s compared to its predecessor, but there are also improvements, and we will tell about it.. In fact, ZTE slightly refreshed last year’s flagship, so as OnePlus and Xiaomi has made. Engineers replaced the top processor of the early 2016 Snapdragon 820 with new Snapdragon 821 chip, used 6 GB of RAM instead of 4 GB, and slightly increased the battery.. It is also important that the smartphone corresponds to modern trends in smartphone construction – it has a dual main camera with sensors from Sony .. As already mentioned, Axon 7s is the continuation of Axon 7 line, but not completely a new product.. Yes, there are changes and they can affect the user choice, but it looks almost the same device.. The specs of both phones are listed in the table below.. Display: matrix AMOLED, diagonal 5.5 inches, resolution 1440×2560 pixels, density 534ppi, 2.5D glass, occupies up to 73.5% of the front panel;. Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, quad-core (Kryo), 2 cores with frequency up to 2.35 GHz and 2 cores with frequency up to 1.6 GHz, 64-bit, technical process 14 nm;. Graphics Accelerator: Adreno 530, frequency 653 MHz;. RAM: 6 GB of LPDDR4 with a frequency of up to 1866 MHz, two-channel;. ROM: 128 GB and support for memory cards microSD;. Camera: dual, 12 megapixel Sony IMX368 + 20 megapixel Sony IMX350, aperture f / 1.8, pixel size 1 mkm and 1.25 mkm respectively, video recording in 4K @ 30fps and optical stabilization;. Self-camera: resolution 8 megapixels, aperture f / 2.2;. Network: 4G LTE Cat6 – download speed up to 300 Mbps, return up to 50 Mbps;.

Audio amplifier Asahi Kasei Microdevices, Dual Hi-Fi: AK4961 + AK4490;. Battery: 3250 mAh, Li-Pol, Charge Quick Charge 3.0;. The Antutu test: about 140,000 scores;. While other smartphone manufacturers updated their flagships on Snapdragon 821 with new models (OnePlus. One Plus 3T, and Xiaomi Mi5 became. ), ZTE only now uses the processor.. However, the South Korean brand LG also used similar chip in LG G6, instead of Snapdragon 835.. The processor itself is very good both in terms of performance and power consumption, so it’s quite logical to see it in updated ZTE Axon 7s.. We don’t speak about memory, because everything is clear. Based on the specs for both devices, it becomes clear that ZTE uses Sony IMX350 module with 20 MP and a second sensor Sony IMX368 with resolution 12 MP.. The manufacturer doesn’t tell us the main feature of additional module, but we think that it will take photos in black and white.. I am glad that optical stabilization has not disappeared anywhere, and aperture is at the same high level – f/1.8.. So, now we should expect from the updated flagship ZTE Axon 7S even better quality when making photos both during the day and at night.. Another important update ZTE Axon 7S is the slightly increased battery capacity.. Yes, 150 mAh is not much, but at least it was not reduced.. Of course, I would like to have more impressive battery capacity for 2K display and a powerful chipset, but display uses AMOLED matrix, so it only takes not so much charge.. As for the price ZTE Axon 7S, there is no official information. But, we know the price of its predecessor – ZTE Axon 7, so we can expect about $360 or slightly more.. The smartphone costs its money, considering both hardware and cool stereo speakers with a sound amplifier.. The release date has not been announced yet..
