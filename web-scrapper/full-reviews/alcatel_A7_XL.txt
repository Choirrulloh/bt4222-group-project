SIM Only SIM Samsung Galaxy S7 black Apple iPhone 7 32GB black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge black Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus black Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus rose pink Apple iPhone 7 32GB rose gold Samsung Galaxy S8 black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge gold Samsung Galaxy S8 grey. A dual camera at an affordable price. Our Alcatel A7 XL review comes hot on the heels of our Alcatel A7 review , so it seems appropriate to first distinguish the differences. The Alcatel A7 XL is much bigger and has a dual camera, which will allow you to get that desirable bokeh effect.. The Alcatel A7 XL will launch in the UK during November and at around £245, it is only a few pounds more expensive than the Alcatel A7. Because of this, the Alcatel A7 XL should be your first choice and it is well worth the extra £40.. The Alcatel A7 XL has a premium full metal aluminium enclosure that has a metallic brushed effect. This gives the phone a quality feel and the aluminium body meets the 2.5D arced Dragontrail glass of the front. The arc is at the edges of the display and they make the phone more pleasurable to hold.. Fill in the form and be the first to know when the Alcatel A7 XL is released .. Dragontrail glass is toughened and very hard to scratch. It is rather similar to Corning Gorilla Glass, which we see on most smartphones today.. New: Alcatel U5 review. This Alcatel phone will be available in Metal Black or Metal Gold, which are probably the two most desirable smartphone colours. The Alcatel A7 XL is pretty light, at 175g, when we consider the size of the device. The thickness sits right in the mid-range at 8.65mm.. The Alcatel A7 XL instantly gives a feeling of wow, due to the size of the 6” Full HD IPS display. There are not too many smartphones around with a screen this big and the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels (367 pixels per inch) is ideal for watching media or for playing games.. The experience is powered along by a MediaTek 1.5GHz octa-core processor with 3GB RAM. It is not quite as responsive as a flagship phone but when we consider the price, it is ideal for its prospective buyers.. The Alcatel A7 XL has a very responsive fingerprint sensor and this unlocks the phone in just 0.2 seconds. The sensor is located on the back face and it sits right beneath the camera lenses. A little functionality has been added and a quick tap will allow users to answer calls or access the private folder.. The internal memory of 32GB gives plenty of room for bringing over content from an old smartphone. If however more memory is needed, then there is a microSD card slot that accepts up to 32GB cards.. The Alcatel A7 XL runs Google’s Android 7.1 Nougat operating system. This brings with it the intuitive Google Assistant, along with other apps such as Gmail, Maps, YouTube and Play Music. Video and music gets a quality upgrade with DTS (Dedicated to Sound) audio enhancements.. The dual 12MP and 2MP camera lenses are a real draw for the Alcatel A7 XL. There are few affordable smartphones around with a dual camera system, so this is a phone to choose if you love your photography.. The dual lenses work to get a greater depth of field, for more detailed and sharper photographs. The dual cameras enable the capturing of true bokeh effects, where the background is blurred.. A slider controls the level of background blur and you can touch objects in the scene, so that they remain in focus. The Alcatel A7 XL will allow you to refocus the shot, even after it has been saved and there is a handy background substitution feature as well.. Camera features that aid in getting good photographic results includes a Dual tone LED flash, HDR (High Dynamic Range) and PDAF (Phase Detect Auto Focus). Video can be recorded at a quality of 1080p and at a rate of 30 frames per second. Both pictures and videos can be shown off on a Smart TV, where Miracast technology is supported.. The 5MP selfie camera has a single LED flash and Face Beauty feature for making enhancements, like smoothing out your skin.. The Alcatel A7 XL has a very big 4,000mAh battery. According to Alcatel, this will give you up to 800 hours of standby (33 days) or up to 18 hours of talk time. A Quick Charger is included in the box and this can bring the battery reserves up to 50% in 40 minutes. Quick Charge will completely charge the phone in around 2.5 hours..

Alcatel A7 XL, A3 Plus and U5 HD Gets Leaked Ahead Of The IFA 2017 Launch. Alcatel A7 XL, A3 Plus and U5 HD Gets Leaked Ahead Of The IFA 2017 Launch. 6 months ago August 21, 2017. Alcatel announced the new The New Idol 5S , A50 & A30 Plus smartphones a couple months back. These are some of the entry to a mid-range offering from the company. However, now it looks like the company is now planning on launching a bunch of other smartphones very soon in the market. Yes, Alcatel is expected to launch a ton of new devices at IFA 2017, but you don’t have to wait until IFA as we already know these devices are.. This new leak talks about four Alcatel smartphones in total and it looks like all of them will be an entry to mid-range devices. These alleged new devices are Alcatel A7 XL, A3 Plus, and U5 HD.. The Alcatel A7 XL as the name suggests is going to be more of a phablet with a huge display on the front. It has been reported that it will sport 6″ display. Yes, 6-inch doesn’t sound like a lot, however, we aren’t talking about a bezel-less offering like the top tier flagships. However, in this case, we are looking at a 720p display which could be an issue if you are used to high-res displays. It has also been reported that this will sport a dual camera setup at the back and the alleged combination is 12MP + 2MP. Unfortunately, apart from that, we have no other info regarding this smartphone, but we hope to learn more in coming days.. The next device in line to be talked about is the Alcatel A3 Plus smartphone. It has been reported that the company will launch both the 3G as well as 4G variants of the same, however, these variants won’t have any other changes in terms of the specs, etc. So essentially, we are looking at a 5.5” 720p display on the front. Sadly, we don’t know anything about them and hence we suggest you stay tuned for more info. But one thing which you can notice from the image below is the fact that the 4G variant doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner. This is quite strange and hence it makes us believe that it will have the sensor on the front.. And lastly, we have some info about the U5 Hd smartphone. Just like the other devices, we lack a lot of info but we at least know that it will sport a 5″ 720p display on the front. This means that it is the smallest or the most compact variant of the bunch. We also know that it will run Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box and it will have some special selfie features. So if you are interested to know more about this smartphone then we suggest you stay tuned.. Having said that, all the above-listed devices appears to be entry-level smartphones. As of now, there is no info about the pricing, but we hope that these will quite affordable considering the low-end specs. We would like to know your thoughts on this. Would you be interested in buying any of these devices if it makes it way to India and if yes, then at what price? Be sure to let us know.. Live Photo Of iPhone 8 OLED Display Assembly Gets Leaked.
