Sony maakt goede en betaalbare producten. Ik ben al jaren een tevreden gebruiker van de Sony Xperia telefoons.. Lekker groot, zodat ik geen tablet meer nodig heb maar compact genoeg om gewoon als telefoon te fungeren. Ik gebruik het toestel dagelijks, kom qua accu redelijk goed uit maar heb altijd een adapter bij me. Het formaat scherm is geweldig net als de kwaliteit van het scherm. Kleuren worden mooi weergegeven en film/Netflix kijken is een waar genot. De camera kwaliteit is ook fantastisch, maak nu super mooie scherpe foto's en nog snel ook.. Ik kan nog geen nadelen vinden die ik kan vermelden. Gewoon een prettig toestel voor een betaalbaar bedrag.. Het toestel heeft een fantastisch groot scherm wat ik erg fijn vind. Inmiddels 2 weken in bezit, kan geen min punt verzinnen, snelle, grote, goed werkende telefoon met uitstekende camera. Het is niet waterdicht, geen vingerafdruk scanner en heeft usb-c maar wat het wel heeft is dan ook wel goed.. Toestelspecificaties voor de Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra. Afmetingen (l x b x h). Processorsnelheid 4x 2.3GHz & 4x 1.6GHz. Beschrijving over de Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra. Met de Xperia XA1 Ultra heeft Sony de opvolger op de Xperia XA Ultra uitgebracht. Voor degene die houdt van een mooi, groot scherm, een waanzinnige camera en een lange batterijduur belangrijk vindt is deze smartphone zeker de overweging waard. De camera met maar liefst 23 megapixels maakt haarscherpe foto’s, ook in het donker en bij veel beweging. De goede prijs-kwaliteitverhouding is opvallend aan het toestel.. Met dit toestel kan je niet om de fantastische camera-ervaring heen. Met maar liefst 23 megapixels aan de achterkant en een 16 megapixel selfiecamera leg je al je bijzondere momenten op zijn best vast. De camera aan de achterkant beschikt over Hybride Autofocus en Quick Launch om snel op te starten en snel af te drukken. Ook de frontcamera doet het uitstekend. Met 16 megapixels maak je gemakkelijk de leukste selfies.. De Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra is door zijn werkgeheugen van 4 GB met een MediaTek Octa core processor Helio P20 perfect in staat om te schakelen tussen al je apps. Geen probleem dus om bijvoorbeeld je mail, bankieren app, muziek, video’s en Facebook tegelijk te gebruiken. Ook de batterij kan hier prima mee omgaan. Is er bijvoorbeeld een app die wel openstaat maar eigenlijk niet wordt gebruikt? Dan krijg je hier een melding van.. Het geheugen van 32 GB is voldoende om veel apps te gebruiken en tal van video’s, foto’s en andere documenten op te slaan. Met de XA1 Ultra is dit geen punt; je kan hem namelijk uitbreiden tot wel 256 GB met een microSD-kaartje. Zo kan je wel honderden apps downloaden en al je waardevolle foto’s en video’s met je vrienden uitwisselen.. Onze klantenservice is 7 dagen per week bereikbaar. Ma t/m vr van 9:00 tot 22:00.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 2 Interface, Processor, Memory and Connectivity. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. by Kaloyan C.. Android - Android + Sony - Sony +. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 2 Interface, Processor, Memory and Connectivity. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction Once again, Sony has unleashed a monster upon the world, this time around called the Xperia XA1 Ultra. It’s the bigger sibling to the XA1, packing most of the same hardware in a larger form factor, with a couple of improvements. But besides its size, the XA1 Ultra has a few more things going for it: a couple of, as the company calls them, “high performance” cameras, a new yet classic Sony design encased within a metal frame, and an edge-to-edge full HD screen. But while its size may suggest otherwise, the XA1 Ultra’s specs put it firmly into mid-range territory, which may be a bit of a problem for all the spec chasers out there. So let’s dive in and see whether Sony’s latest phablet holds up under deeper scrutiny: Design A classic Sony in a supersized form factor Like it or not, Sony’s carved its own little niche in terms of smartphone design and is steadfastly sticking to it. This is very much the case with the XA1 Ultra, which carries that classic, ultra-tall Sony look, but with a couple of extra tweaks added on top. But first, let’s address the elephant in the room – which is, coincidentally, the XA1 Ultra itself. This thing is absolutely gigantic, putting to shame most every other device that dares call itself a phablet. And while this isn’t a bad thing per se, the usability costs associated with such a huge device don’t entirely feel justified.. However, one-handed use isn’t as bad as one would expect it to be – while it could never be called a comfortable experience, it’s still entirely within the realm of possible for more straightforward tasks, such as scrolling through your Twitter feed. The biggest reason for this are the XA1 Ultra’s non-slippery back and sides, a change from the smaller XA1 which makes adjusting your grip to reach the further parts of the screen a less risky experience than it would otherwise be with such a big device. But while the phone itself sits well in the hand and feels sturdy and solid, it sure doesn’t look so – there’s a ton of seams between the different panels, somewhat diminishing the otherwise good-looking design. As for the buttons, both the volume rocker and the power button did their job well enough. However, the dedicated camera key is just all-around bad – it’s mushy and way too easy to press, while also not providing enough feedback.. Display A surprisingly great panel that actually outclasses Sony’s own flagships in terms of color reproduction At a whopping 6 inches, the XA1’s display is its centerpiece, debuting a newish visual design for a Sony phone, no side bezels present. Well, almost – turning the display on reveals a pair of sneaky black borders on its sides, which diminish this effect. The panel itself is a full HD one, with a pixel density of 367 ppi, which isn’t the best, but should be more than enough for everyday usage. But what’s pleasantly surprising here is the XA1 Ultra’s color reproduction, which is actually pretty good for a mid-ranger, thanks to its accurate blues and greens. However, yellows tend to be a bit greenish, while reds are overall a bit weak. Still, compared to, say, the XZ Premium, this panel is better in terms of accurate color reproduction, though it’s still a tad too blueish.. 6.5 x 3.11 x 0.32 inches. 165 x 79 x 8.1 mm. 5.71 x 2.64 x 0.31 inches. 145 x 67 x 8 mm. 6.17 x 3.06 x 0.31 inches. 156.8 x 77.6 x 7.9 mm. 5.96 x 2.97 x 0.31 inches. 151.35 x 75.35 x 7.85 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra Compare.

If they had used the SD625 along with a 4000mAh battery the XA1 Ultra would have been the best Midrange device of 2017!. (Posts: 5868; Member since: 06 May 2016). posted on 22 May 2017, 10:11. But as it stands, the 2017 Galaxy A7 is the best midrange phone... It's battery life is ridiculously good, with a whopping 115hrs endurance rating at GSMArena, and also great SOT on PhoneArena.. (Posts: 347; Member since: 16 Nov 2011). posted on 22 May 2017, 13:13. @trojan the A7 has a great battery life but it's quite expensive for a midrange device. IF Xiaomi would offer the mi note 4 in Europe - Germany I would go for that: sd 625, 4gb RAM, 64gb storage and a monster 4100mah battery for under 200 us dollar.. (Posts: 306; Member since: 04 May 2017). posted on 22 May 2017, 10:44. P20 is a bit better than SD625.

Recently, I bought a Sony Xperia XZ Premium and I love its performance and efficiency in terms of operations and battery. I further purchased another Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra which categorized as mid-range phone. I love this XA1 Ultra very much too; for its big screen and value for the money - which made available of its HD resolution screen, 4GB Ram and sufficient internal storage of 64GB (as compared to XA1 - its younger sibling). I love Sony phone products, in particularly these two new phones (Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XA1 Ultra).. (Posts: 188; Member since: 19 May 2017). posted on 15 Jul 2017, 04:29. Just picked up the US version today as well. So far this is a killer phone, although I wish it was $50 cheaper and used usb-pd so more chargers would work with it. On pace for 7 hours SOT for the first charge. Only real desire is that is had double tap to wake.. (Posts: 2; Member since: 20 Nov 2017). posted on 20 Nov 2017, 14:09. Everywhere I read issues with the battery life on the XA1 Ultra [Amazon and some other sites], but Phonearena has rated this as "Excellent" [better than many of the premium/top end phones based on their measurement methodology!!!]. Did anybody else notice that and were you surprised by this at all after purchasing the phone? The phone is really tempting to get - a phablet in gold!!!. (Posts: 2; Member since: 20 Nov 2017). posted on 22 Nov 2017, 19:13. I got the phone and sure enough the battery life is anything but disappointing! It's pretty good!. Want to comment?

Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra release date: Q1 2017. Sony’s 2017 MWC offerings are varied to say the least. Bad naming conventions aside – Xperia XA1 Ultra, seriously?! – there are a number of slightly niche products being unveiled.. One such device is this outstandingly huge handset, with a whopping 6-inch display and a 16-megapixel selfie snapper with optical image stabilisation (OIS).. Having used the Nexus 6 for eight months a few years ago, I know what it’s likes to hold a large phone – and the Xperia XA1 Ultra does nothing to change my opinion of them. Its slightly rounded design does make it comfortable to hold with both hands, but with only one it becomes completely unwieldy.. Related: All the news from MWC. Unlike the smaller Xperia XA1 that ships with a disappointing 720p panel, the 6-inch one featured here is 1080p and it looks pretty good.. Like every panel Sony chooses, it’s bright and colourful, with enough detail to please pixel-peepers. 1080p is a fine resolution at 6-inches, especially considering this isn’t a high-end flagship device.. It seems that Sony is trying to separate itself in the highly contested mid-range space by kitting out its phones with impressive cameras. On the rear of this device you have the very same sensor that impressed in the Xperia Z5 a couple of years back. It has a 23-megapixel 1/2.3-inch sensor, an f/2.0 aperture and phase-detection autofocus. My only issue with this camera is speed: it was slow with a high-end CPU, and I’m not convinced it’s going to be any different here.. The front-facing camera is even more interesting. The 16-megapixel sensor matches the Samsung Galaxy A5 and OnePlus 3T , but goes one step further by adding OIS and a front-facing flash. Optical image stabilisation should steady those late-night, slightly fuzzy, bar snaps – always a welcome bonus.. One particularly standout spec of the Xperia XA1 Ultra is the battery. I’d expect a hulking phone such as this to have a substantial battery, but this isn’t the case here, which is a big worry.. The 2700mAh unit is small, especially considering the generous screen, and I have serious concerns about how long this handset will last before you need to reach for a USB Type-C charge cable. A Sony rep claimed one day of juice, but I’ll have to put a review sample through its paces to really know.. Like the Xperia XZ, the Xperia XA1 Ultra ships with Android 7.0 Nougat. Sony’s skin has improved over the years and it’s one of the cleanest, although there are a lot of Sony’s own media apps installed. However, a nice touch is that Google Now sits on the left-most homescreen, as it does on Pixel and Nexus devices. Android’s split-screen multitasking is also present and works well on a screen of this size.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

It’s nice to have more RAM, but 4GB seems a little excessive on a mid-range phone. I’d have happily accepted 3GB with a bigger battery. There’s 32GB internal storage too, which can be expanded via the microSD card slot.. Sony should at least be given credit for trying something different, but this doesn’t feel like a phone that’s suited to many people. In fact, its market is probably very niche. Having a generous screen size is great, but some of the other specs are a little odd. The big question is: will that tiny battery really last the day? Unfortunately, I’m not convinced..

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Following in traditional Sony design, the XA1 and XA1 Ultra are two very similar phones with their “flat” looks, but there’s obviously a huge size disparity. When it comes to being pocketable, the XA1 is one of the few high caliber phones in the market that can be handled with a single hand – allowing your thumb to easily encompass all corners without too much stretching. However, the Xperia XA1 Ultra is on the complete other end of the spectrum with its gargantuan stature. Moving onto the good stuff, Sony managed to slap 23MP 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS sensors into both phones, which are being pegged for their low light performance. They’re so confident about the performance of its news cameras, they’re promising stellar quality at ISO 6400. It’ll be intriguing to say the least, but we’ll save our reservations until we can snap some shots on our own and meticulously comb over the results. For the selfie lovers out there, they’ll gravitate towards the 16MP front-facing snapper that’s on the Xperia XA1 Ultra – with built-in optical image stabilization and an LED flash.. Sony has clearly bombarded us with a bunch of new devices, but are they any good? One striking item that’s missing in all of them, even with their “premium” nature, is that none of them have fingerprint sensors. Sure, we might see variants of them in other markets with fingerprint sensors, but it’s just a shame there are none whatsoever – it’s something we’ve come to expect today, including entry-level stuff. Overall, the strength of the new XA1 line seem to hinge mostly on their cameras, especially under low light conditions, which is an area where few phones excel in – so it’ll be intriguing to see how they fair.. While Sony fans enjoy the recent announcement of the company’s brand new flagship phones, the Xperia XZ Premium and XZs, they also used Mobile World Congress 2017 to unveil its successors to the Xperia XA line that were introduced last year. For those who aren’t able to. afford the pricey cost of Sony’s flagships, the Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra should prove to be more cost effective – without sacrificing the charm with Sony’s designs. Focusing on beefy cameras, superior audio and visual technology, and near bezel-less displays, they’re certainly going to offer some bang for the buck.. The XA1 Ultra is on the complete other end of the spectrum with its gargantuan stature.. Sure, Sony loves to tout the borderless designs with their edge-to-edge screen, but the compromise is seen in the space above and below the displays – where the huge bezels become eyesores for the phones. Despite that, we can’t deny that they look lovely, especially on the XA1 Ultra and its ginormous 6.0-inch 1080p display. It’s roomy to say the least, but unfortunately for the XA1, it’s stepped down to a 5.0-inch 720p screen.. Sony managed to slap 23MP 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS sensors into both phones. Specs-wise, they’re very similar if you look down the sheet, but there’s just a slight advantage with the XA1 Ultra – like its screen resolution, larger 2,700mAh battery, and front-facing camera. Everything else, however, are pretty much identical between the two. Take for example the processor, a 64-bit based octa-core MediaTek helio P20 processor, which handles all the basic stuff nicely from what we’ve seen so far. They’re both also running Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, with Sony’s usual custom skin.. Interestingly, none of Sony's new phones sport fingerprint sensors. In terms of release and pricing, Sony has announced that the XA1 will begin to go on sale on May 1, 2017 through retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, B&H, and much more, for the price of $299.99. That’s not too shabby when you think about it, but we’re curious to see where they place the XA1 Ultra later on in late spring. We’re hoping to see it under $500 at the very least, just because anything more than that, it’ll be competing against other giants in the premium space..

VINE VOICE HALL OF FAME TOP 10 REVIEWER. 4.0 out of 5 stars Not Sony’s best but still impressive. Color: White | Vine Customer Review of Free Product ( What's this? ). This is a lengthy review, a phone as sophisticated and noteworthy as this one deserves full attention to details. Because it is a new product of course complete testing will take additional time, this review will be updated as needed. I have always liked Sony products, especially their TV's and cameras. I don't think there's a room in my house without at least one Sony product. However I've only been able to admire their smartphones from afar, they generally are priced way out of my range. The XA1 series however, brings a lot of Sony niceness down to a more budget-friendly realm. This series has two phones, a 5" model and this, the newer Ultra 6" model. HOW BIG IS IT? Let's let the cat out of the bag right now ... this phone is huge, almost bordering on tablet territory. In fact its screen size is spec’d at exactly the same 6” size as a Kindle but in a device that’s a fraction of the size. This is NOT one of Sony's ultra-premium models and other than the better-than-average build quality (typically Sony) the overall performance is good, but not fantastic. Other phones offer higher resolution displays, not that this one looks bad; it's just not the best out there. Sound quality (something I would hope Sony would excel at) is better than some but not as good as the best, and surprisingly there are no stereo speakers. THE CAMERA And the camera? The one thing you absolutely expect Sony to be best-of-class at? Let me be clear that I am a pro photographer with a critical eye and I have a great deal of respect for Sony cameras. Despite mind-blowing specs on paper, the XA1's camera quality failed to make me go WOW. They brag about how quickly you can go from off to picture-taking mode (1.1 seconds) but once you actually press the button the camera is comparatively slow to complete the task, and sometimes misses the ideal setting completely. The results are not as good as I expected, and in low light they sometimes disappointed me. The selfie cam on the other hand is impressive ... wider angle than most to cram more friends in the frame, a real front flash that actually works and a cool shutter release that's activated by waving your hand (that only gets tricked once in a while). The full-face screen that goes almost to the very edge is sure to impress the Joneses, but the weird little gap with a tiny black border gives away the fact that this isn't Sony's best effort. The phone is chock-full of features and gimmicks, too many to list here. It ships with Android 7.0 Nougat and Sony' better than average overlay. Response (as you would expect) is lightning quick. Despite being huge in your hand it's not slippery and the beveled edges feel better than you would expect. The control buttons feel, um, very iPhone-like. Get ready, though, to buy some new cables because this phone ditches the more common micro USB in favor of the incompatible USB-C. At least it still has a headphone jack! EXPLAINING THE SAMPLE PHOTOS A side-note about the size comparison and camera quality photos with this review. Why compare it to an iPhone? I assure you I understand that this phone and the iPhone are very different devices and my comparison is in no way intended to suggest one is better than the other. The IPhone 6s was used because it is the only other smartphone in our household and it was handy. The 6s is almost identical in size to the iPhone 7 and together the two of them represent a large percentage of phones people own, so I thought a size comparison might be useful to some people. As far as the photo sample comparison, as a professional photographer who has written books and taught classes on the subject I have said countless times that more megapixels does not mean better picture quality, there are so many other factors involved in a camera’s ability to take high-quality pictures. The samples I used weren't staged in any special way, just a spontaneous random snapshot taken at the same time from the same spot of a wall-hanging in our living room under low lighting conditions (the light of a 40 watt bulb). The settings on the two phones were whatever the camera defaulted to (and granted with user adjustment settings both photos could be enhanced). No flash was used because I wanted to see how they would do under a challenging low light condition. Finally, be aware that both photos were cropped identically to exactly 10% of the full frame, so you are seeing an extreme example of “digital zoom”. The samples you see are the result, you can draw your own conclusions. That being said, my random snapshot comparison was not counted by me in rating this phone, I plan to post some additional sample photos later. But I want to make it clear that the Sony's camera is extremely good and I've already taken some very nice photos with it. If anything the comparison only points out that (like most cameras with tiny sensors) this one is not perfect, especially under low light in which it seems to crank up the gain way too much. NON-POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS I was surprised and disappointed at the battery life, it’s not only bad it’s really bad. I could almost watch the battery-level meter ticking downward toward zero. I’ll offset that by saying that Sony packs numerous of their apps into the phone and with any new phone it takes a little time to customize how the device is set up. But even after deleting some apps and changing the settings battery life is still pretty bad. On one hand that is to be expected from a phone with a huge hi-res screen, I’ll see how it is after a few weeks of use. Another little quirk that has been an annoyance is that dedicated camera shutter release button. In concept I love the idea but it seems super sensitive to the point that I can hardly hold the phone in my hand without accidentally taking a picture. But, I don’t want to disable the feature either. It seems maybe Sony should have used a stronger spring in that button that would require a more firm push to activate. INITIAL SUMMARY Is this the best phone out there? No. Does it represent Sony's best effort? No. All things considered (including price) is it worth considering? A qualified yes on that one ... after using it I would rate it as one of a handful of phablets worth considering if you're into a lot of video playback and don't want to break the bank (although the lack of stereo speakers on a multimedia-aimed phone is a disappointment). As a camera phone when you want to leave the real camera home it should please most people most of the time (but there are definitely better camera phones out there). And used as strictly a cell phone for talking and texting it’s probably a lot of overkill but it's hard to imagine anyone being disappointed. But … remember this is not supposed to be Sony’s top of the line phone. When you consider what this phone sells for and how much value you get for the price, it is still very much one that should be on your short list of super-size smartphones to consider. As this phone is used more I will try to update this review as needed and of course answer any specific questions if I can.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Gigantic and Amazing Phone. I'll start off by saying this is the biggest phone I've ever owned, so it is taking a bit of adjustment for me to hold with one hand (I have pretty big hands,) to hold sideways and use the keyboard (even though I'm doing that right now for this review and the predictions and auto correct are pretty spot on,) and it feels noticeably bulkier in my pocket. All those things aside considering I knew I was buying a large phone... It feels like there's no delay when I open games on my phone. Games like Pokémon Go, Brave Soul, Crusaders of Light, etc. all open on this phone quickly and look absolutely stunning. Not to mention the giant screen makes things easier to see. I threw in an old 64gb micro SD card along with my nano SIM and was immediately using this phone without any hiccups. All four buttons are on the right side of the phone - volume up/down, power (which is lock and unlock button, as per usual,) and the camera button. Though spaced apart perfectly enough where they're not in the way of each other, I kinda wish the power button was on top of the phone. That's just a preference of habit, though! The speaker is on the bottom of the phone alongside the charger port. Takes the C charger, which is gonna be the future universal charger in my opinion (kinda like going from cassette tape to CD,) due to the faster data and electrical transfer speeds. How's the speaker? I'd truthfully say mediocre. It's also in a spot that can easily and accidentally be covered by your index finger when holding the phone horizontal. That or maybe I just hold my phone weird. I consider the camera pretty stunning myself, but I'm also moving up from a phone that had half the MP on both cameras compared to this one. I don't see a single grain in new photos off this phone. Finally, the part I love most. This phone doesn't strong arm you into using the pre installed "bloatware" like other phones typically do. You don't wanna use the default music and photo apps? Don't give them permission. This phone asks you permission for pretty much every app that comes pre installed. When you say no, it's not a clingy girlfriend. It leaves you alone permanently until you attempt to use the app again. It may seem overwhelming when first setting up the phone (essentially, imagine a "Do you wish to allow...?" every 30 seconds for maybe 5-10 minutes,) but after that it's smooth sailing. And that minor and short-lived annoyance is a tiny price to pay in my opinion for Sony being nice enough to ask for my consent before bloatware assaulting my phone. Tl;Dr My rating speaks for itself. For the tech in this phone, the size, the midrange price... I'd highly recommend if you have a thing for large phones, but don't want one of the phones that are tablet sized.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Works much better than the HTC, Samsun, and Motorola phones I've used. Very slim and I LOVE how Sony keeps updating and making things easier. 5.0 out of 5 stars Works much better than the HTC. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Like the saying goes...you get what you pay for. I wanted an inexpensive phone since I'm tired of wasting money on so called high-end expensive phones. 3.0 out of 5 stars Like the saying goes. I was hoping it work with super charger but you can only use a super charger 3.0 that also support MTK Pump Express plus(PE2. 4.0 out of 5 stars I was hoping it work with super charger but you can only use a super charger .... What a beautiful phone,took it to metro pcs to have it connected and they asked me where I got it said it was a very sexy phone. 5.0 out of 5 stars What a beautiful phone, took it to metro pcs to have .... I gave this a 3 star because this product battery life is embarrassing. if you buy this phone ensure never to leave your charger at home. I also find that even with a Qualcomm 3. 3.0 out of 5 stars Battery life is bad but has a fast processor and good screen resolution.. Best phone I've had Sammie s7, s5, note 5 those phones are overrated. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. The Bluetooth never worked for this phone.. 3.0 out of 5 stars Bluetooth problem. This is a great phone at a decent price, the only drawback is the camera, the picture quality is not the best. The phone is a little big for some but it's still a great value.. 5.0 out of 5 stars This is a great phone at a decent price.

No stereo speakers on a phone that's clearly targeted towards multimedia use. Sony's love for big screens goes all the way back to 2013 and the 6.4" Xperia Z Ultra, which was followed by a phablet in every generation since. Some four years later we have the Xperia XA1 Ultra at our doorstep, all 6 inches of it. And since we headed down memory lane, the Xperia T2 Ultra certainly deserves a mention too. While the Z Ultra packed some flagship-grade internals, the T2 Ultra was less obsessed with specs - and screen size for that matter, its display diagonal coming in at 6 inches sharp.. But it's really the Xperia C3 that we'd call the XA1 Ultra's spiritual ancestor, even if it was on the "small" side in phablet terms, a 5.5-incher with zero Ultra in its name. You see, the C3 sported a high-res selfie camera (5MP was pretty high at the time) that was among the first to have a flash. The C4 brought some improvements, but it wasn't until the C5 that Ultra returned to the model name. The Xperia C5 Ultra added even more megapixels and autofocus to the front cam, putting a 6-inch screen in a slimmed down body.. The X-ifying of Sony's smartphone lineup marked the next chapter in the XA1 Ultra's past. Its predecessor was called the XA Ultra - X because they all were part of this series, A for midrange, and Ultra for, well, 6 inches. Yet another upgrade in the selfie camera department saw a hike in resolution (of course), but also the introduction of OIS - a checkmark on only a select few spec sheets. So there we have it - the Xperia XA1 Ultra. The name we already broke down to bits, and there's the 1 that signifies second generation in Sony's twisted logic. There's not much in terms of front-facing camera upgrades this time - a flagship-grade shooter goes on the back instead, the basics like RAM and storage are now more than just barely adequate, and an efficient 16nm Mediatek chipset will try to get better mileage out of the same measly battery capacity.. Sony only fits fingerprint sensors in its high-end phones (though the feature is disabled in the US), but the XA1 Ultra isn't one of them. Fingerprint recognition has become more or less a given on even much cheaper devices, and its absence on the XA1 Ultra can't go unnoticed. We're also not massive fans of the top and bottom bezels that can almost be described with the same adjective.. The side bezels, on the other hand, are probably among the slimmest in Sony's Xperia lineup. It's bewildering why Sony wouldn't trim them on its more expensive phones in a similar manner, but we're sure they have their reasons.. Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra press images. Ask us and you'd get a unanimous 'more is better' response when it comes to battery backup. Ask Sony and you'd be told that last year's capacity is just fine. After spending time with the smaller Xperia XA1 (sans the 'Ultra'), we'd be inclined to reconsider - the more advanced chipset sure helps, but brute force (a.k.a. larger battery) can't hurt either, right?. Right, but let's stay on track - before we get to the battery life, there's unboxing and hardware overview to be done.. Unboxing, 360-degree spin, hardware overview 3.

Aditya Shenoy , 01 September 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra offers good battery performance. It misses out on a fingerprint sensor. Selfie camera has Optical Image Stabilisation and performs well. Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra design Xperia XA1 Ultra specifications and features Xperia XA1 Ultra software and performance Xperia XA1 Ultra camera performance. Japanese electronics giant Sony has been struggling with its smartphone division for quite a while now. To cut losses, it chose to stop making its ‘Premium Standard’ smartphones to focus only on its flagship lineup. This year, Sony already two flagships in the form of Xperia XZs ( Review ) and the Xperia XZ Premium ( Review ), with the Xperia XZ1 series becoming official in Berlin this week. Earlier, Sony also launched the Xperia XA1 Ultra , a device with mid-range specifications and a premium price tag. With the price hovering around Rs. 28,000, does the Xperia XA1 Ultra deserve your money? We put it through our tests.. Those familiar with the design on Sony Xperia smartphones will struggle to find anything refreshing at first glance. It still sports the same design as a lot of its predecessors in the Xperia range. A closer look is required to notice the minor changes that Sony has made. For starters, the body is no longer curved around the edges and has a boxy design like the Xperia XZ series. Sony calls it Loop Surface Design, which is visible when looking at the phone from the top. The sides are curved at the front and the back making it easier to hold in the hand. While this design worked with the smaller XZ Premium, the bigger size of the XA1 Ultra causes the edges to dig into your palms during use.. The Ultra branding in Sony terms denotes a big screen and the 6-inch display puts the phone in the list of big screen smartphones. We like how the screen blends into the body, it is hard to figure out how big the display is when the screen is off. Power the display on and you will find out that it is edge-to-edge with almost no bezels on the sides. While this makes you hold your breath, the thicker bezels at the top and bottom immediately start looking like an eye sore. One thing we did like about the display is that it did not register accidental touches despite the thinner side bezels. While you can see two grills on the front, only the top is utilised by the earpiece while the lower seems like just a design element. Sony could have opted for a stereo speaker setup to do justice to the big display.. We found the power button on the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra to be well placed and the volume button may need you to shuffle the phone based on how you are holding it. It also houses a dedicated camera button just like other Sony smartphones. It is a two-step camera button which can be half-pressed to focus and pressed fully to click the image. You can also quickly launch the camera app by long pressing the camera button. The XA1 Ultra has the loudspeaker at the bottom along with the USB Type-C port. At the back, it houses a 23-megapixel camera. along with a single LED flash and a 16-megapixel camera on the front with a selfie flash.. The smartphone does not sport a fingerprint scanner which is surprising given its price point. Sony told Gadgets 360 that since its fingerprint scanner location is unique (in the power button on the side), it plans to keep it limited to its flagship devices at the moment. It added that low-end and mid-range Sony smartphones didn’t sport fingerprint scanners in the past and it did not plan to introduce it this year, but that will be of no consolation to prospective buyers.. The Xperia XA1 Ultra was priced around Rs 31,990 at launch, a price that is used by smartphone manufacturers to launch their budget flagships. For that price, apart from the 23-megapixel camera, there is nothing that’ll catch your attention on the spec sheet. It has a 6-inch display with a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top for protection. The bigger screen at that resolution manages to push out 367 pixels per inch. It is usable and did not appear pixelated. We found it to be bright enough indoors but the huge display tends to get a little reflective outdoors. It has good viewing angles and you also get the option to tweak the display output and white balance.. To power the smartphone through tasks, Sony has opted for the MediaTek Helio P20, the same chip it uses for the Xperia XA1. The Helio P20 is an octa-core processor with four cores clocked at 2.3GHz and the other four cores clocked at 1.6GHz. It has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage which is expandable via the dedicated microSD card slot up to 256GB. The XA1 Ultra has two nano SIM slots with support for 4G and VoLTE on both slots. Apart from this, the XA1 Ultra sports Bluetooth 4.2, NFC and WiFi ac support for connectivity.. The XA1 Ultra houses a non-removable 2700mAh battery with Qnovo Adaptive charging tech which reduces the charging speed when the battery nears 100 percent charge. Sony told Gadgets 360 that this helps to extend the life of the battery and it is working towards increasing battery life, instead of shipping phones with bigger batteries.. The Sony XA1 Ultra runs on Android 7.0 Nougat with its custom Xperia UI on top. It has the essence of stock Android but Sony has added a few of its own customisations on top. It has the app drawer with an ability to create folders to club apps together. You can swipe right from the home screen to access Google Now or swipe from the top to trigger a search. Sony has customised a few settings like battery, where you will find the inclusion of Stamina Mode and Ultra Stamina mode that. The storage and memory settings have also been worked upon and we found them to be user-friendly. You also get a few apps like SonyLIV, its entertainment app; Playstation, a Sony Playstation Companion App; and AVG Protection, an anti-virus app pre-installed. Sadly, you can’t uninstall these apps, but only disable them.. Sony supports themes and gives you the option of selecting from a few pre-installed themes to buying one of its themes from the Play Store. Themes are applied quickly without the need to restart the device, so if you fancy customising your phone, you might like this. We found the phone to offer good performance though it did take a tad bit longer when launching apps after a fresh boot. RAM management is good and the smartphone had close to 2GB of RAM free on average after a day of use. We also found the big screen comfortable when typing with both hands in portrait mode.. Like other smartphones we test, the XA1 Ultra was subjected to multiple benchmark tests. It managed to score 64227 on Antutu while scoring 847 and 3822 in Geekbench 4’s single core and multi-core tests. In our HD video loop test, the phone managed to run for 11 hours and 48 minutes, which is decent considering its battery capacity and the big screen it is required to power. The phone managed 21FPS in GFXBench in the T-Rex benchmark.. We enjoyed gaming on the Xperia XA1 Ultra as the big screen helped it deliver a good experience. The phone could run Asphalt 8 and Clash Royale without any issues while running cool. We did observe that the battery percentage dropped at a higher rate when gaming, just like the Gionee A1 Plus. ( Review ) which is also powered by the same SoC. Battery performance otherwise is surprisingly good as the phone could manage to go beyond a day with light to medium use with idle drain kept low. Call quality on the Xperia XA1 Ultra is quite good on all networks including Reliance Jio.. Sony has opted for a 23-megapixel camera at the back with contrast + phase detection hybrid auto focus but misses out on laser auto focus. You also get a single LED flash and not the dual tone flash which has become more common now. At the front, the 16-megapixel selfie gets a front flash and features Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) which the rear camera misses out on. Sony told Gadgets 360 that using two OIS modules in the slim body wasn’t possible. It also mentioned that the Ultra is a selfie-focused smartphone and there is a higher need of stabilisation since a selfie is clicked with one hand.. The camera app is made by Sony and has Superior Auto mode like found on most other Xperia smartphones. Apart from that, it has a manual mode which allows you to adjust white balance, exposure, shutter speed, ISO and manual focus. With Superior Auto mode on, we found the phone to be quick to adapt to lighting situations and would also bump the shutter speed up if it detects motion. The two-step shutter button is quite useful when clicking photos as well. We found that the camera would occasionally refuse to click a photo if it failed to focus. It would take time to focus and only then clicks a photo. While this may be helpful in some cases, you may miss a shot as there is no way to force it to shoot.. Photos turned out really well though we must say that greens look a little artificial. We did not find any issues even when clicking against the light. Macros turn out well and there is good separation between the subject and the background. We had to tap a few times to get the camera to focus exactly where we wanted it to, which could be because of the missing laser autofocus. In low light, the camera adjusts itself accordingly but the output wasn’t as expected. Photos in low light appear grainy and there is some loss of detail.. The phone is capable of full-HD video with both the front and rear cameras, and you also have the HDR mode for the rear camera. There is no 4K video recording which is now available on phones at this price point. Selfies come out really well and the OIS helps keep shakes to a minimum when recording video. In low-light we found the selfie flash to be helpful and images were sharp with the flash on.. Verdict The Xperia XA1 Ultra is a big screen device aimed at people specifically looking for a phablet for entertainment purposes. Its big bezel-less display is ideal for watching content and playing games but could have done with some stereo speakers. We like how Sony has tuned the Helio P20 chip and the Xperia UI to deliver good battery backup but the lack of a fingerprint scanner and 4K video recording are two of the major drawbacks of this smartphone.. The Xperia XA1 Ultra isn’t a bad phone, but the competition makes it look overpriced. For the same price, the OnePlus 3T. ( Review ) offers a fingerprint scanner, 4K recording, and significantly better performance. If you don't mind stretching your budget a little, the Honor 8 Pro. ( Review ) offers much better value. But if it is the big display that you want, then the Xiaomi Mi Max 2. ( Review ) will save you a lot of money.. Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra in pictures.

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Ultra by name, but is it ultra by nature?. This super-heavyweight of a smartphone packs a great screen, an interesting camera and dependably solid battery life all in a wallet-friendly offering. But with cheaper rivals offering more for less, better value can be found elsewhere.. Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra price and availability Key features Huge screen Qnovo battery tech 23MP main camera Design and display Bulky but comfortable Big and beautiful display. Phablets and Sony have a long relationship – 'Xperia' and 'Ultra' are two names that have been associated with one another for some time, Sony phones often being among the very biggest phones.. The Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra, released in May 2017, is a prime example. With a 6-inch display it can hardly be considered petite, and unlike some newer releases it does nothing to hide this size behind a trendy aspect ratio or minimal bezels.. This is a handset that is proud of its heritage, borne of a manufacturer which seeks to use the word traditional in its design, that meaning a boxy profile and bezels for miles.. Sony's handset division has long been struggling, trying to find its feet in an enormously competitive field, even with a storied brand name attached. No matter whether it has attached 'X', 'Z', or both to the names of its devices, success has eluded it.. With an unapologetic rectangular shape, a huge footprint and a lot of expectation attached, does the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra do quite enough to continue the somewhat suspect fortunes of the Xperia name?. Since its May 2017 arrival the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra price has dropped and it can now be picked up SIM free for around $320, £240, AU$440.. In the UK the XA1 Ultra can be picked up from a variety of retailers including Amazon, AO and Argos, and can be had for free on contracts starting at £24 per month.. Does it really need to be said?. What the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra has over almost all and sundry, is real estate. The screen which takes up almost the entirety of the device, which justifies its entire existence.. And it is a very pleasant 6-inch IPS LCD screen. It has a 1080p resolution, good colors and no drop off in brightness or saturation at odd angles. It isn't AMOLED though, which is a shame for the price point, and pixel junkies will need to look elsewhere for their pixels-per-inch binge, as there is no QHD goodness to be had here.. We generally found that the screen proved to be sharp enough though, with the relatively reduced resolution contributing to improved battery life and performance in gaming.. Another interesting addition is the 23MP rear-snapper. The megapixel wars are long over, yet Sony is still on a quest to cram as many pixels as possible into an ever-shrinking sensor size, and the XA1 Ultra is jam-packed.. A whole host of fancy camera tech has been inherited from the previous generation of 'X' flagships, though only time will tell if that starts to translate into a real performance difference.. A less attention-grabbing gimmick, but an important one nonetheless, is the inclusion of Qnovo smart battery technology.. The idea is simple: batteries age badly over time because charging isn't currently smart. Qnovo technology solves this problem by monitoring the amount of charge going into a phone battery, preserving its long-term health. This is a relatively new tech, so only time will prove its efficacy, however it is a nice value add-on regardless.. Since the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 burst onto the scene in 2017, phone design has never been the same. Consumers now expect trendy shapes, eschewing sharp corners for rounded edges and seeking the total eradication of anything resembling a bezel.. With this in mind, the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra is positively retro. The screen is, of course, massive – a 6-inch panel which dominates the front of the device. What makes it stand apart is the use of bezels. Large ones too, both top and bottom, with the sides blessedly remaining free.. Despite this, and being 165mm tall and 188g, one-handed usage is surprisingly easy, even if it still requires a few feats of acrobatics on occasion. This is a device where certain ergonomics have clearly been considered at every stage of its design, maintaining an even balance in the hand.. The rear of the handset is coated in aluminum, which feels very cool to the touch and suitably premium. Everything has a reassuring heft, and the device feels as though it could take a knock or two and keep on going.. The 'loop' design that Sony is taking great pains to promote is also obvious from the top and the bottom, lending this phone something special in a sea of cookie-cutter 'try hard' designs.. With the front being dominated by the display, it also makes room for a call speaker, a front-facing flash, a selfie camera and more (the bezels leave a great deal of room).. On the right can be found the power button (which doesn't double as a fingerprint scanner), the volume rocker and hallelujah a two-stage shutter button.. The top houses a 3.5mm headphone jack, the bottom a speaker and a USB-C port, and the left is completely flush.. In all, should this have been released in 2015, it would have turned heads, but in the era of the Honor 7X the LG Q6 and more, it feels decidedly retro. For a certain type of buyer, it represents a unique shape that they will snap up regardless, as Sony fans have done for some time now.. The display itself is a cracker. For an IPS panel it has excellent contrast and pretty good sunlight legibility, aided in no small part by strong maximum brightness. Backlighting is even, and there is no color shift, although as is typical for IPS it has a somewhat cool color cast.. As is the case with Sony phones, this color contrast can be altered with the display calibration tool built into the settings menu. For almost anyone, this screen is good enough however, and is certainly a joy to watch films and play games on.. It must be said that while the feel of the device is nice, the attention which went into trimming the side bezels could also have been extended into the top and bottom.. At the moment, in the hand this is a step away from holding a cinder block, here's hoping the next iteration will lose a few pounds and a little height in the process..

Good Stuff Outstanding secondary camera; captures extremely detailed selfies and has an OIS too for reducing shake Primary camera has excellent image quality in daylight Smooth performance Bad Stuff Battery backup is not good Primary camera turns out noisy images in low-light Absence of fingerprint scanner is a bummer. The Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra comes under the mid-range price category. The refreshed symmetrical design from Sony gives the XA1 Ultra a futuristic and robust look. The Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra is a selfie-oriented smartphone device. The device measures 165 x 79 x 8.1 mm and weighs 88 grammes. It is available in White, Black, Gold, and Pink variants.. One of the key features of the Sony Xperia XA1 includes its large 6.0-inch IPS LCD display. The display has a Full HD resolution and a scratch-resistant layer on top. The users can fully benefit from the large display as it will enable a better multimedia experience. Also, the thin bezels around the display give the Xperia XA1 Ultra a better look.. As most of the device in the market have a 5MP or an 8MP secondary camera, even for a flagship device, but that is not the case with the XA1 Ultra. The Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra has an astonishing 16MP secondary/selfie camera with autofocus and LED flash; it also has an OIS (Optical image stabilisation) to prevent shaky images. The rear-facing camera on the Xperia XA1 Ultra is equally astonishing with its 23-megapixel resolution; it has a hybrid (Phase-detection & laser) autofocus technology and an LED flash. Sadly, there is no OIS in the primary camera.. The Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra is powered by MediaTek’s Helio P20 chipset; it houses an octa-core Cortex-A53 CPU and Mali-T880MP2 GPU. The chipset is mated to 4GB of RAM. Sony’s decision to choose the MediaTek over Snapdragon will impact the sales of the device in a worse manner. The Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra has an expandable built-in storage of 64GB.. The only downer off the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra is its small 2,700 mAh battery. Nonetheless, it has Pump Express+ 2.0 technology for faster and cooler charging. The wireless connectivity on the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra is achieved by dual-SIM 4G LTE with VoLTE , Bluetooth v4.2, Wi-Fi ac/b/g/n, NFC, and GPS with A-GPS.

Philippines Market Forecast for Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra:. Top-end smartphones are all about industry-best features and a few exclusive ones added in to make them one of a kind. Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra comes in as a bigger and better option over its predecessor. Rated highly by experts, this is one of the most anticipated devices from Sony's stable.. Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra is a larger device than its sibling which lacks the 'Ultra' coinage. This series was first introduced as a mid-range smartphone. But it did not make a mark on the market failing miserably. Sony looks to change all of that now with this upcoming model.. Sony always sticks to their basic design elements. This device is no exception in sporting the rectangular design with curved edges. But what guarantees a second look is its end-to-end display module. Coming to that later, this is an all-aluminum body with a 2.5D arc glass up top and precision crafted curves all around. A polished rear panel with zero rear camera bump provides a chic and confident grip.. Dimensions come in at 165 x 79 x 8.1 mm and this device weighs in at 188 grams.. But this is where the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra scores high. An exceptional camera is what is expected from Sony and they have delivered. The rear camera boasts a huge 23 MP module with a 1/2.3 inch Exmor RS sensor. Added PDAF with Laser AF and a LED flash are evidently present. A f/2.0 aperture adds to this setup leading the way for excellent still images. FHD video recording capabilities also score high over other devices in this segment.. The front camera is an 16 MP shooter with similar specs. What sets this selfie cam apart from other ones around is its dedicated ¼ inch Exmor RS image sensor. Expected to be one of the front shooting modules around, this is one of the biggest USPs of this device.. A Mediatek MT6757 Helio P20 processor uses an Octa-core Cortex-A53 setup. Top clock speeds are around 2.3 GHz. Graphics acceleration comes in the form of the latest-gen Mali-T880MP2 GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).. To sum it up, this is where Sony decidedly improves over its current-gen models. Moving ahead of putting a processing setup in their devices enough for processing ultra-quality images, Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra has one of the best processor setups in its price segment.. Finally coming to the display, this is a 6.0 inch IPS LCD screen with a native resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Sony intelligently squared up this Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra with an ergonomic display which will keep buyers glued to say the least. And with a pixel density of 244 PPI (Pixels Per Inch), this is one of the best 6-inch displays around.. Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra runs on an Android 7.0 Nougat. There's a high chance that it will come with the latest updates. Sony obviously wants to keep it simple by avoiding UI and opting for pure Android experience.. This device will come configured with a 4 GB RAM and 32/64 GB internal storage. Extendable memory maximizes at 256 GB via microSD cards.. This device is powered by a 2700 mAh Li-ion battery with Quick Charging (MediaTek Pump Express Plus 2.0).. Philippines are one of the most important mobile device markets now. It hosts a group of rising mobile device manufacturers. What's more, it has a highly demanding consumer market too. Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra comes with multiple exclusive top-end features along with a price-tag which puts it just below the high-end segment. Opening to strong online sales in Philippines, this device looks likely to continue as an attractive mid-range device which is nearly high-end.. Reviews of Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra.

Where once a 5” display was considered massive; today it is considered small and the XA1 Ultra’s 6” display is now within the acceptable norm for a smartphone.. The XA1 is the 2017 update to the original XA Ultra.. For the most part, the differences are minimal, but a few specifications have been improved to ensure it competes with the current crop of mobile devices.. Clove Technology only sells official UK specification SIM Free and factory unlocked smartphones for use on any UK / EU network. For 4G / LTE support outside of the EU, please check the specifications and your local carrier.. The Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra is set to be available in a variety of colour and memory options.. Internal memory is either 32GB or 64GB with 4GB of RAM available with each model.. The colour options are Gold, White, Black and Pink.. See the different options available to buy at the top of the page.. The trend appears to be that bigger is better and the XA1 Ultra from Sony has that box ticked.. The impressively large 6” touchscreen display is ideal for managing emails through to watching the latest YouTube video.. At this measurement, it is likely 2 hands will be needed to hold and manage the device, but that need not be the case all the time.. With such real estate available this full HD display makes it easy to create and edit documents, media and other tasks you might want to complete on a phone.. Enjoy less scrolling as you visit web pages and consume your social media feeds.. For those times when one-handed use would be preferred, the XA1 has a mini-display feature that allows for effortless single-handed interaction. Essentially it reduces the 6” screen into a smaller display in the lower left or right corner, allowing for less stretching and more productivity.. An impressively large yet slim form factor, for such a large screen the physical dimensions of this device are just 165 x 79 x 8.1mm and it weighs just 188g.. The smaller profile is helped considerably by the almost bezel-less left and right edges to the phone.. Oh, and for peace of mind, industry leading Corning Gorilla Glass is installed on the XA1.. Sony has always included powerful cameras in their smartphones and the XA1 gets a small improvement on last years model. Increasing to 23 megapixels, from last years 21.5, the Ultra still boasts the Exmor™ RS for mobile image sensor, Hybrid autofocus, quick launch and capture, F2.0 aperture and 5x clear image zoom.. All of these technologies work together to deliver a camera experience that is second to none and will result in simply superb photos to share with colleagues, friends and family.. The odd selfie or video call is often a requirement of life today, so the XA1 Ultra looks to ensure as much detail is captured from the front camera as the back. Whilst it does not boast quite the same megapixel count, rated at 16, it uses the 1/2.6" Exmor RS sensor and has a wide angle lens that lets in lots of light.. The inclusion of a physical camera shutter button is not something you see all that often today and the XA1 is one to deliver, so it has just that. Whilst an on-screen shutter is available, the physical button gives that reassuring click and confidence that you have got the shot.. Out of the box Android 7.0 is installed, not only giving you access to all the popular Google Apps and services that many of us have come to know and love but all of those available through the Android marketplace, otherwise known as the Play Store.. Download all the latest titles along with the more obscure that you need, want, or rely on to just get things done on the go.. Sony has also included plenty of their own customizations that allow you to get more value from this 4G enabled handset.. With 32GB of internal storage most apps and media can be loaded right onto the internal memory, but if you need it the microSD card slot provides the possibility for, up to, another 256GB of storage space.. The MediaTek Helio P20 octa-core processor and 4GB of RAM should combine to keep things ticking along nicely.. USB Type-C connectivity is included as is Bluetooth 4.2, NFC and GPS.. A large screen can consume a lot of power and, whilst the Android OS has ‘doze’ technology built in to conserve power, added benefit comes from the fact that the 2700mAh internal battery can be charged quicker (correct mains adapter required) thanks to MediaTek’s Pump Express Plus 2.0 technology.. The XA1 Ultra is an excellent smartphone with a big screen but without the big price tag.. Speed 2.3GHz 1.6GHz (2 x Quad-Core). Make/Model MediaTek Helio P20 Octa Core 64bit.

When it come to Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra , there is no question about its fine design, excellent display quality, high quality camera and ultra fast performance. However, if you consider the features, it has some critical drawbacks. First of all, Sony should have consider metal body for a phone of this price range. This can dramatically increase the amount of interested customers. As more and more pupils are looking for premium metal body especially, if they are ready to pay this much cash. Secondly, this phone definitely should include a fingerprint sensor. For such a classy modern phone, it is quite surprising that there is no fingerprint. Other than these two facts, Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra is quite a good deal to consider.. User Rating: 3 ( 27 votes). Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra Rating by MobileDokan.

Sony has not had a lot of sales success with its Xperia lineup of Android smartphones, especially outside of Japan. That’s not stopping Sony from trying however, as it. hopes to win us over with the new devices that are being announced today at Mobile World Congress. So what does Sony have in store for us? Four new phones,. two of which we cover in another post. He we focus on the Xperia XA1 and Xperia XA1 Ultra, the successors to the previous Xperia XA and XA Ultra phones that were first released in 2016.. Xperia XA1 has a 5-inch display while the. Xperia XA1 Ultra has a big 6-inch screen. Both have edge-to-edge displays, again much like the previous phones, but still have large top and bottom bezels. Both of the Xperia XA1 models also have 23MP rear cameras for people who are serious about their mobile photography. They will also ship with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box.. Now that we have that out of the way, let’s take a look at the specs and features for these new Sony phones.. Based on just the press renders, the design of the. Xperia XA1 will differ very little from the Xperia XA, with its slim case and display that is almost, but not quite, curved at the edges. The 5-inch display in the new phone will support 720p HD resolutions. It will also have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage, with a microSD card slot to add up to 256GB of additional storage. The big stand out feature on the. Xperia XA1 is its 23MP rear camera, well above the 13MP camera in the Xperia XA. The camera will include features such as an ISO6400 sensor for low-light photography, a. 24mm wide-angle F2.0 lens and more. The phone also has an 8MP front-facing camera.. Like its little brother, the Xperia XA1 Ultra doesn’t look that much different in terms of design, compared to the older XA Ultra. The big 6-inch screen supports full HD 1920×1080 resolutions. MediaTek Helio P20 octa-core processor, but this phone will have 4GB of RAM. Sony will release versions with 32GB and 64GB of onboard storage, with a microSD card to add up to 256GB of additional storage. It will also include a larger 2700mAh battery.. The Xperia XA1 Ultra will have the same 23MP rear camera that the smaller XA1 phone has, but the Ultra model is going after the big selfie audience with its huge 16MP front-facing camera. It includes features like Optical Image Stabilization and a front-facing LED flash, along with an ISO6400 sensor for both low-light photography and video. We will have lots more information about both the Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra when we get some hands-on time with both phones.. When they go on sale, consumers will be able to purchase the new Xperia XA1 phones in a variety of colors; White, Black, Pink and Gold. The unlocked Xperia XA1 will go on sale first in late April or early May in the US for the price of $299.99. It will be available to purchase at retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, B&H Photo and others. Sony plans to launch the larger Xperia XA1 Ultra sometime in late spring 2017, but it has yet to reveal its price tag. There’s no word yet if any US wireless carriers will sell either one of these phones, but don’t hold your breath as they have typically bypassed many of Sony’s previous phones..
