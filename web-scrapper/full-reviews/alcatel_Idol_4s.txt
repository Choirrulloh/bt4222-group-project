It has a high-end design and build, a great camera, impressive display and a convenience button dubbed the Boom Key.. The Bad The Boom Key needs finessing: It's easy to accidentally activate. The fingerprint scanner is small and sometimes difficult to engage.. The Bottom Line With a premium build, good camera and free accessories in the box, Alcatel's Idol 4S is a solid midrange buy.. Haven't considered buying an Alcatel phone before? The unlocked Idol 4S, made of metal, glass and moxie, will work its butt off to change your mind. It's got a large screen and excellent audio quality; a 16-megapixel camera and an 8-megapixel camera with front-facing flash; a convenience key to quickly launch apps; a fingerprint scanner; and a screen layout that orients itself as "up" no matter which way you pick up the phone. With competitive pricing and a list of impressive specs, the Idol 4S is aggressively taking on the excellent OnePlus 3 , a CNET editor's choice phone. (Full list of specs, prices and phone comparisons below.). It's a very good midrange phone, but Alcatel's ambition to make it a sleeper value hit, like last year's deal-of-the-century Idol 3 , falls short. The price jumped up to $400 US (£385, AU$470 -- converted), but Alcatel includes among other things, a screen protector and VR headset for free in the box. Problem is, the screen protector dulls viewability and we'd rather just save some bucks on the phone than be pushed into a VR platform we didn't pick ourselves. In other words, that is "value" we just didn't want.. You can buy the unlocked Idol 4S directly from Alcatel's website. It runs on a GSM network -- in the US, that means you'll have to buy a SIM card from AT&T, T-Mobile, Cricket Wireless or MetroPCS.. Build and design: The first time anyone picks the Idol 4S up, they have the same reaction, "Oooh! This is nice." The glass and metal body remind us of the feel of the iPhone 4/4S. Boom Key (convenience key): You can program this to open apps, like the camera, which is a shortcut. We love this in theory, but in practice, we kept accidentally taking unintended photos. Either it needs some finessing or we do.. The Boom Key has another trick up its sleeve. When you are on a phone call, press it to engage a noise-cancelling mode that improves voice quality. But why isn't this feature just on all the time? And besides a small vibration, there isn't any other indicator (onscreen) that the noise-cancelling mode has been engaged. This led us to pressing the Boom Key repeatedly, uncertain if we were toggling the mode on or off.. Cameras: Overall, photos look bright, colorful and have wonderful contrast. In good light, the autofocus is fast and accurate. We noticed the phone lagged when processing photos both in HDR mode and in low-light conditions. Low-light photos sometimes looked soft, as if someone had smeared Vaseline over the lens.. Impressively, the Alcatel Idol 4S can shoot 4K video at 30 frames per second (fps). And for a phone, the video looks good. Personally, we'd probably still just shoot 1080p video because the files are smaller.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars HIGHLY Reccomend, great phone!. Offer Type: Phone with VR | Verified Purchase. I broke my Iphone 6 plus and I was not willing to pay $750+++ for a new Apple phone. I have to admit I was a little leery of this phone given the fact that I am a long time Apple user. After some careful research I decided on the Alcatel IDOL 4S. It is much more affordable and still delivers the high end experience I was looking for. So far I am extremely happy with the purchase and would highly recommend anyone to give this phone a shot. In terms of speed my IDOL 4S is noticeably faster on the web in the same environment as my Iphone 6 plus. In terms of battery I could barely get through half a day on my Iphone with heavy use. My IDOL 4S ends the day with between 30% and 40% of power left with the same kind of usage. When you do need to charge it has some technology that charges the phone super fast called “quick charge 2.0”. I take a ton of pictures with my phone and I love the fact that this phone offers a flash on the front and rear sides of the phone. The ability to expand the memory on the phone with a micro SD card is a huge plus to me because I keep so many pictures on my phone. I rarely listen to music through my phone's internal speakers, however this phone has two speakers on it! (One on the top of the phone and one on the bottom.) I compared it to my iphone and it's a huge difference. You get a surround sound affect and it is much louder than any of my other phones. I haven't tried out the VR googles yet, but the JBL headphones that come with it are surprisingly good quality. Alcatel also throws in a screen protector, making this phone a complete package. I am an AT&T customer and they have an app called "AT&T mobile transfer" that literally takes minutes to transfer all your contacts, videos, and pictures from your original device to your new device. So easy to use and it doesn't matter if you are going from Apple to Android based. 5 stars across the board, VERY satisfied customer!. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Great build quality, great screen and front facing speakers. Android 6.0.1 could hold this phone back for some.. Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. Great build quality and great screen. The processor isn't flagship class so some games will stutter a bit. I've had this phone for about 5 months and has been a solid daily driver for me. I originally had the Idol 3 but it broke in my back pocket, so having this sturdy slab of metal and glass is great. Recently had an update that gave back the boom key functionality (extra loudness for video and music). I could have bought the Idol 5 but liked the screen better and based on some of the reviews, the front facing speakers were better. What I like: +build quality +front speakers - for calls and music +boom key (reprogrammable) +screen +Integrated EQ - didn't think it was a needed feature, but since I use multiple wired and wireless headphones, it helped with the overall sound quality. Using wired will get you better results and in my opinion sounds better than the iPhone 7, Idol 3 and my previous HTC One M8. Didn't think I would notice the difference, but you can tell. One thing to note is that by default it will be switched on, but you will have to toggle it off and on if the phone has a cold start or you rebooted the phone. Don't know why, but if you don't your calls will go through H+ or 3G. What I dislike: - Processor is much slower than I thought it would be. When comparing it to my iPhone 7, there enough difference in performance for some games. Bleach Brave Souls and Marvel Future fight come to mind. - Heat - when playing games or any processor intense activity will cause this to heat up. A case is definitely a must. - Bluetooth strength isn't the greatest - Battery life isn't the best and if you play games, this isn't its strong suit - Camera in low light/indoor situations is terrible. If you have too many apps open, you'll also find a slow "quick start" when you double tap the power or boom key button. - Software is stuck on 6.0.1 Overall I've been pleased with this phone. I wish I could rock this without a case, but heat and just the fact its glass it isn't advised. daily tasks like music, video and some game play is great. Camera in great light is also good and comparable to my iPhone, but avoid low light situations. Perfect phone if you get it for under $180 or below. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. This phone makes my son's IPad phone look like a very overpriced toy.

For the first 4 hours, my phone worked, but after charging the phone for 5 hours, it turned off for some reason and wouldn't turn back on. 1.0 out of 5 stars May have a design flaw. Works great and my son loves the vr.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Satisfied. This phone will die!!! Had this phone for quite some time. Recently implemented this 'update' and it turned the phone into a brick!

It aims to entice buyers away from more expensive, well-known handsets, such as the Galaxy S7 or HTC 10 , by packing in more extras than you can shake a stick at. The biggest of these is a bundled virtual reality headset.. The VR headset is more Google Cardboard than Samsung Gear VR, but, aside from a few weird software decisions, the Idol 4S is a solid phone that will meet most users’ needs.. My only real qualm is how much the “free” headset adds to the phone’s upfront cost, which is a little high in a world full of great-value smartphones like the OnePlus 3 and Moto G .. Video: Best Smartphone 2016: What’s the no.1 phone right now?. The Idol 4S has a near-identical design to the Smart Platinum 7 , which Alcatel’s parent company TCL built for Vodafone. It has the same glass back and front, and from a distance the two phones are indiscernible.. Up close there are a few important differences, which in my mind make the Idol 4S feel like an inferior handset. For starters, the Idol 4S doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner. The scanner on the Vodafone Smart Platinum 7 was a nice touch that made it quicker and easier to unlock the phone, and I’m a little peeved to see it missing.. The power button has also been moved from the phone’s central right side to the top left. Alcatel’s done this to make room for the Idol 4S’s custom Boom button, which is designed to boost the phone’s audio levels. The move to the top left makes powering the phone up a bit of a chore, as the button isn’t at a point where any of my digits naturally fall when holding the Idol 4S one-handed.. This would be fine if the Boom button was a positive addition, but generally I found it about as useful as a third nipple. Alcatel claims the button will enact different commands depending on which app you’re using. Specifically, if you press it when listening to music, you’re meant to get a volume and bass boost, and in calls it’s meant to “raise the caller volume and improve clarity”.. In practice I didn’t find the button very useful. Testing the Boom button in the music app, the feature offered a negligible improvement on bass levels, but bizarrely dropped treble and mids, supposedly in a bid to make the low-end sound chunkier. The end result was a fairly unbalanced sound. The button worked a bit better in calls, but only seemed to raise the speaker volume.. This isn’t too much of a problem, though, as the phone’s speaker and microphone are more than capable. You wouldn’t want to play music off the speakers, but they’re powerful enough for bedtime Netflix watching. The microphone also accurately picked up my voice during calls and ensured the person on the other end of the line could hear me, even when chatting on a busy London street..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. Outside of this the phone is comfortable to hold, though the glass back is a smudge magnet and picks up scratches fairly easily. I’d also have liked to have seen the Alcatel use the new USB-C standard as opposed to the older Micro USB. USB-C is an all-round improvement that boosts charge and data transfer speeds.. The Idol 4S comes with 32GB of storage space, which can be upgraded by as much as 256GB using the phone’s microSD card slot. The combination means most users shouldn’t have to worry about running out of storage, if they have the cash to pick up a decent-sized card.. The Alcatel Idol 4S’s 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED screen in one of its biggest selling points. The 1440p resolution easily bests those of competing mid-range, and some high-end, handsets. It’s the same as that of the Nexus 6P and is higher than the Full HD resolution of TrustedReviews ’ currently recommended sub-£400 handset, the OnePlus 3 .. This means spotting individual pixels is a near-impossible task, and icons and text are uniformly sharp. White levels aren’t the purest I’ve seen, but the AMOLED tech ensures blacks are nicely deep and inky.. Maximum brightness levels are also above average and my only real quibble with the screen is that colours are slightly overcooked. The calibration isn’t as bad as the OnePlus 3’s or Nexus 6’s, but reds in particular look oversaturated, especially when viewed at an angle.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

The unlocked Alcatel Idol 4S ($399, 32GB) is a sign of the times. Rather than coming in a typical cardboard box, the phone is affixed directly inside a companion VR headset. It's also bundled with a bunch of other free accessories including JBL earphones, a collection of Incipio cases, and a tempered glass screen protector. With all that swag, you might worry Alcatel is trying to distract you from the quality of the phone itself. But the Idol 4S has a sleek glass-and-metal build, a gorgeous Quad HD AMOLED display, and strong overall performance. Overall it can't beat the OnePlus 3 , but it brings something different to the table and offers good value for the price.. Alcatel One Touch Idol 3 (Unlocked). Design and Features If it wasn't for the Alcatel logo on the back, you probably wouldn't be able to tell that the sleek Idol 4S is the successor to the far less glamorous Idol 3. The front and back are both covered in glass, which is held in place by a strip of metal running along the sides. It's sort of like a cross between the OnePlus X and the Samsung Galaxy S7. The back of the phone doesn't feel slippery, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so you'll probably want to use one of the cases that it comes with.. View All 11 Photos in Gallery. At 6.06 by 2.97 by 0.28 inches (HWD) and 5.26 ounces, the 4S is remarkably svelte. It's thinner and lighter than the OnePlus 3 (6.01 by 2.94 by 0.29 inches, 5.57 ounces) and the Apple iPhone 6s Plus (6.23 by 3.07 by 0.29 inches, 6.77 ounces), making it easy to slip into your pocket. I had no problem using the phone with just one hand.. You'll find a variety of buttons along the metal edges. There's a volume rocker on the right and a Boom key below that. The Boom key activates several different functions depending on the app you're in. On the home screen it generates live wallpaper effects; using it in racing game Asphalt 8 activates your turbo tapping it while listening to music or on a phone call kicks up the volume. The functions are programmable, so you can also have it turn the screen on with one press, take photos with a double press, long press for burst shots, or launch any app on your phone. You can also disable it entirely.. There's a power button on the and a combined SIM/microSD card slot below that. The 4S had no trouble working with a 200GB SanDisk card , and Alcatel says it can handle cards up to 512GB. The bottom is home to a charging port.. The back of the phone is made of black glass and features a fingerprint scanner below the camera lens. It works, but it's not very fast. It usually took at least two seconds to register and turn the screen on in testing, and I sometimes needed to trigger it more than once to get the phone to unlock.. Display and VR The Idol 4S has a gorgeous 5.5-inch 2,560-by-1,440 AMOLED display, which works out to a dense 534 pixels per inch ( ). It looks both sharper and more saturated than the 1080p, 401ppi display on the OnePlus 3. Viewing angles are great, and I had no trouble seeing the screen outdoors. Overall, it's as good as any top-tier phone we've tested.. As mentioned earlier, the 4S comes packaged in a VR headset. The headset is made of sturdy white plastic and includes a comfortable, cushioned velcro strap. If you wear glasses you can keep them on, which is a nice selling point compared with alternatives like Google Cardboard and the Samsung Gear VR .. The headset features two capacitive forward and back buttons on the bottom with haptic feedback. The 4S recognizes when it has been placed into the headset and immediately launches into VR mode, which includes Games, Video, Photo, 360-degree Video, 360-degree Photo, a Tutorial, and Littlestar, an app that plays select movies and videos in VR. There's also a VR Store that essentially pulls VR apps from Google Play. Two games are also preloaded, Lamper VR and Titans of Space.. Using the headset was comfortable and intuitive, though the phone will heat up and feel warm to the touch after extended periods of use.. Network Performance, Connectivity, and Audio The Idol 4S is available unlocked. It supports LTE bands 2/4/5/7/12/17, so it works well on AT&T and T-Mobile networks. I tested it on T-Mobile in midtown and saw solid speeds both indoors and out. The phone also supports dual-band Wi-Fi, and I got speeds of 150Mbps down and 80Mbps up when connected to our 5GHz FiOS test router. You also get NFC, which is useful for quick pairing and Android Pay.. Transmissions are clear and free from any crackling or distortion. Voices sound natural, and noise cancellation is great at blotting out background noise. The earpiece delivers ample volume; you'll have no problem using it in noisy environments.. See How We Test Cell Phones. Similar to the Idol 3, the 4S features front and back speakers nestled along the top and bottom edges of its frame. As far as phone speakers go, these are positively and more than capable of filling a room with sound. It's certainly louder than the HTC 10 , which has a single mono speaker. That said, don't expect much in the way of bass; this is still a phone, after all.. Plugging in the included earbuds makes for a pleasant listening experience thanks to hi-fi audio. Music sounds excellent, with good bass and clarity across a variety of genres. You can customize sound profiles using the Waves MaxxAudio app, which is a further boon for audio-minded users. Sound quality isn't quite as strong as it is on the HTC 10, which has a 1-volt headphone amp, but it's still impressive for the price.. Processor, Battery, and Camera The 4S is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor. On the AnTuTu benchmark, which tests overall system performance, the phone scored 81,576, which is twice as high as the Snapdragon 617-powered Motorola Moto G4 Plus (47,210). Those numbers show that the phone delivers a lot of power, though not as much as the Snapdragon 820-powered OnePlus 3 (141,429).. With 3GB of RAM under the hood, the 4S can handle multitasking without issue. You'll notice occasional sluggishness when playing a high-end game—Asphalt 7 and GTA: San Andreas push the phone to its limits. In-game graphics are beautifully rendered and controls are responsive at first, but if you play for a long time the phone will warm and you'll experience stuttering imagery and some latency in controls, but not to the point where it will ruin your game.. The phone managed to last for 6 hours of streaming full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. That's just as long as the Moto G4 Plus, but almost four hours short of the OnePlus 3 (9 hours, 48 minutes). You should have no trouble getting a full day's usage out of the phone, and the included adapter supports Quick Charge 2.0, which fully charges the device in 95 minutes.. The 16-megapixel rear camera is a bit disappointing, despite sounding promising on paper. It has manual controls, supports 4K video capture at 30fps, and has a bunch of unique modes, including 360-degree video and iPhone-style live photos. But when it comes down to actual performance, a lack of optical image stabilization meant that a number of pictures I took came out blurry. More significantly, I had some issues with consistent exposure. Pictures I took outside during a sunny day were clear, with minimal noise and grain. But pictures taken at the same location on a cloudy day were filled with noise and grain, and were often too dark, with trees and buildings cast into shadows and the sky overexposed. The 5-megapixel front camera is passable, but nothing special. You'll get better camera performance with both the OnePlus 3 and the G4 Plus.. Software The Idol 4S comes running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and Alcatel has promised that it will get an update to Android 7.0 Nougat. While this is encouraging, fans of stock Android will likely be turned off by Alcatel's heavy UI layer and custom launcher.. App icons are quite different, as are screen transitions, animations, and the notification shade. And that's not to mention the lock screen images that change every time you turn on the and the wallpaper with live effects that recalls HTC circa 2010. I can't help but wonder if the phone would run even smoother without all of these modifications.. In addition to the UI overhaul, Alcatel doesn't skimp on additional features. It includes a range of new functions like gesture controls, drawing on the screen with your finger to launch certain apps, a Glove mode that makes the screen more responsive when you're wearing gloves, and a Reversible mode, in which the phone interface flips when using the phone upside down.. You'll also find a bit of bloatware on the 4S. There's the VR Store, of course, which you can't uninstall. You also can't remove Littlestar, , TiZR Lifecasting, and NextRadio. The two VR games can be uninstalled, as can Facebook, SwiftKey, Twitter, and WhatsApp. You're left with 23.53GB of storage available, out of a total of 32GB. It's not a terribly heavy load, and the phone supports Android's Adoptable Storage, so you can use a microSD card to expand the memory capacity, without having to worry about what's stored in the phone's memory and what's on the card.. Conclusions The Alcatel Idol 4S is a sleek Android phone with a beautiful display and lots of useful accessories for the price. At $400, it's a relatively affordable way to get into VR, especially compared with buying a Gear VR and a pricey Samsung phone to go with it. But you will be making some compromises. Y ou can't push the phone as hard as the OnePlus 3 when it comes to high-end gaming, and it doesn't have the same camera performance and minimally altered UI you get with a OnePlus phone. If you're looking for something more affordable, we like the new Motorola Moto G4 and the Blu Life One X. That said, if you're tired of smartphones that all look, feel, and act the same, the Idol 4S is a breath of fresh air.. Bottom Line: The Alcatel Idol 4S is a unique unlocked Android phone that comes with a VR headset and plenty of other accessories, offering good value for the price..

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. it's not dead, it's just resting. While the world waits for the currently mythical Surface phone, Windows 10 needs a smartphone to champion its mobile ambitions. The previous Lumia flagships from 2015 need to be replaced. Can Alcatel's Idol 4S be that handset?. T-Mobile Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 (image: Ewan Spence). There's a lot going on here, and the best way to do this is to break it down by the handset's full name. Take a deep breath and join in... " the T-Mobile Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 - Virtual Reality Included " package.. This handset allows the network to offer a modern Windows 10 powered handsets to its customers. While Windows 10 Mobile phones may not be making a huge impact on the market share statistics, there are circumstances where Microsoft's operating system will be a good fit for a customer. The focus here is probably on the enterprise market.. With the best will in the world, 2015's Lumia 950 and 950 XL handsets are getting a bit long in the tooth. With the Surface Phone unlikely to show up in the near future the landscape is clear for a Windows 10 handset to come in and claim the flagship crown.. T-Mobile Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 (image: Ewan Spence). Alcatel is smart enough to realise that this is not going to be a huge selling handset. That means the economy of scale required in manufacturing cannot be found in the volume of units sold of the Windows 10 handset. Luckily there are other ways of finding scale. The Idol 4S for Windows 10 is built on a common hardware platform and eagle-eyed smartphone followers will recognise the Idol 4S as an Android-powered device released in mid-2016; others may recognise it as the BlackBerry DTEK60; now we can add Windows 10 into the mix.. This says something comforting about Windows 10 - that it runs on a reference design platform, that it does match up hardware wise with Android devices of the same class, and if manufacturers decide to move forward and implement Windows 10 powered mobile devices during 2017 (or, more likely in 2018 when the Redstone 3 update to Windows 10 brings more mobile features) then the design work in their Android handsets can be recycled.. The Idol 4S platform offers solid specifications for a handset that is pushing towards the premium end of the market, but is still able stay within a sensible budget. The Windows 10 version bumps the processor up to a SnapDragon 820 with 4GB of RAM. It has a 21 megapixel camera, and moves from microUSB to USB-C for desktop connectivity and charging. One area that sees a drop in specification is the screen, moving down to a 1080p display from QHD on the Android handsets.. T-Mobile Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 (image: Ewan Spence). In regular use I think this was the right choice to go with higher chip specifications and make back the budgetary balance on the screen. Microsoft's mobile devices have always been incredibly economical with real estate, and the screen never feels cramped or lacking in information even though 1080p is the minimum table stake for a mid- to high-end handset.. The SnapDragon 820 is close to the top of the performance tree (at least for a handset released late in 2016) and its paired up with 4 GB of RAM. The built-in apps are smooth, you can switch between them with ease and the experience is as you would expect given the specifications. Loading times, switching to apps from the multitasking view, it just feels like a slower machine than it should be. Something just feels a little bit off. How much this affects you comes down to the Windows 10 question of how much you will rely on the built-in apps compared to third-party experiences.. T-Mobile Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 (image: Ewan Spence). I'm less enamoured with the physical layout of the Idol 4S design. With the power button high on the left-hand edge in a normal grip the power button is inaccessible. More than that, my natural grip rests over the camera shutter button. Muscle memory of reviewing countless handsets has me thinking this reachable and distinctive button is the power button and not the camera button. It remains an annoyance even at the end of the review period.. This is mitigated if you set up the fingerprint sensor on the back of the device to unlock the Idol 4S, but the lag between scanning the finger and the handset jumping to the home screen is uncomfortably long.. T-Mobile Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 (image: Ewan Spence). I'm not going to dwell too long on Windows 10 as an operating system. It's a known quantity to me, and with the Idol 4S with Windows 10 arriving in mid-cycle for the OS there's nothing that I would regard as new in the package. It retains the advantages of Windows 10, with live tile support on the home screen offering buckets of 'glance and go' information and customisation. It comes with a PIM suite that easily syncs to your Microsoft account and the integration with Microsoft's cloud services (including Outlook 365, photo storage, backup, and the Groove music service) is as polished as you would hope.. You can't get away from the a chillies heel of Microsoft's mobile efforts... there is a shortage of apps. Yes the big names are now pretty much covered in some form (your Facebooks, Twitters, and Instagrams of the world are all here), but if you're looking for the latest online services out of Silicon Valley you're going to be looking in the Windows App Store for a long time. Microsoft has tried many approaches to this over the years but the problem remains.. Your one saving grace might be using the standards-compliant web browser, but it's not going to suffice in every circumstance. Anyone purchasing a Windows 10 powered smartphone needs to be aware that what you get in the box and what you can see online when you order the handset may be all you are going to get. That's probably enough for Enterprise users and those who want a smartphone to help organise life as opposed to being a tool for leisure and entertainment, but the strong base of built-in apps is all you should count on..

Free Amazon Fire TV 4K w/ 1 month of DirecTV Now. Xbox One X | Surface Book 2 NEW Dell XPS 13. Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 review: a great option at an incredible price. Does the Alcatel Idol 4S stand up as a true high-end phone with Windows 10 Mobile? You bet it does.. In late 2016, there are not a lot of choices if you want a high-end phone running Windows 10 Mobile. The year-old Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL can still be found even at bargain prices, and the pricey HP Elite x3 is likely out of reach for many.. Enter the Alcatel Idol 4S launching today on T-Mobile and you have a refreshingly great looking and feature packed phone at a competitive price. What makes the Idol 4S so good for Windows 10 Mobile? Let's find out.. Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 Specs. Snapdragon 820 | Quad Core CPU @2.15 GHz. 5.5-inch FHD AMOLED Dragontrail 2.5D Glass. 21 MP rear camera 8 MP front-facing camera. 3,000 mAh Quick Charge 3.0 420Hrs Standby 15Hrs Talk. Dual speakers with Hi-Fi surround sound. 153.9 x 75.4 x 6.99 mm. BT 4.1 A2DP, OPP, HFP, AVRCP, PBAP. Quick Charge charger + USB Type-C cable. Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 Hardware. The Idol 4S with Windows 10 Mobile is a different beast than the mid-ranger Android version launched in July. The processor has been bumped to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 (up from a Snapdragon 652). The internal storage jumps from 32 to 64GB, and there is an additional 1GB of RAM bringing the total to 4GB (although only 3.5GB is available due to the 32-bit OS). Even the camera gets a megapixel jump from 16 to 21.. Nonetheless, there are a few downgrades too. The display drops from QHD (2560 x 1440) to FHD (1920 x 1080), and the phone oddly loses NFC, which means there's no chance for Microsoft Wallet and Tap to Pay.. The Idol 4S with Windows 10 Mobile is a different and better beast than the Android phone that shares its name. The display is not a big deal as Windows 10 Mobile looks just fine at Full HD, and the AMOLED display and Dragontrail glass combo look great. The loss of NFC and lack of Tap to Pay option, however, is a bit of a letdown.. The Idol 4S has a shared tray for the nano-SIM and microSD card. T-Mobile says it can take a 32GB card and Alcatel's notes say it can take 128GB, but thanks to the SDXC standard the actual limit is 2TB. Since there are no such cards, you can at least drop in a newer 200GB microSD card for all your music, photos, and apps and use all that storage.. Overall, the Idol 4S is a balanced and relatively high-end phone for 2016. Considering it is also $230 cheaper than the HP Elite x3 at $469, Alcatel as done a great job.. Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 Design. Normally, I'm leery of well-priced but high-end phones from companies outside of the traditional Samsung/LG/HTC camp (even more since I found Alcatel's cheaper OneTouch Fierce XL a bit underwhelming).. I'm happy to report that Alcatel nailed the Idol 4S's design. The phone is all glass and metal (yes, it has a glass back), but there's a reason why such models have entered the mobile market. They feel premium, and the Idol 4S is just that: first class.. I would caution, however, if you are prone to drops you should put a case on it as this phone will not take to hard floors or pavement very well at all.. Alcatel nailed the Idol 4S's design. At just 6.99mm thin the phone feels outstanding to hold while not veering into the too slippery realm of Samsung devices. Nothing about the Idol 4S feels cheap. No detail is missing, including the little exclamation point and grooves on the dedicated camera key. Sure, that camera key (the recycled 'Boom Key' from the Android variant) is placed in the middle of the side, but this is not concerning.. The black and gold color scheme – reminiscent of HP's recent Spectre series – is modern, but not flamboyant; elegant, not gaudy.. The Idol 4S features metal volume control (right side) and power buttons (upper left). The placement is unique, but I had no trouble adapting. It's certainly better than the Lumia 950 XL's odd setup. The buttons have adequate travel and tactile feel with no wiggle.. Between the weight (152g), thinness, and materials, Alcatel has easily created the best-looking Windows 10 Mobile phone to date. The only thing that may bother some people is the protruding camera housing. Haptic feedback and vibration alerts fall on the soft and weak side. If you want loud and powerful, go for the Elite x3, which is like an electric razor whenever a notification comes in/. Finally, there's a white LED in the front that serves as a charging indicator and nothing more. It's a satisfactory addition letting you know the phone is charging.. Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 Display. The Alcatel Idol 4S features an ample 5.5-inch Full HD (1920x1080) AMOLED display. Instead of Gorilla Glass, Alcatel has opted for Dragontrail, manufactured by Asahi Glass in Japan. Dragontrail features the usual 'high strength versus thinness' display tech with effective scratch resistance.. While the Elite x3 is arguably too big at 6-inches, the Idol 4S hits the sweet spot. It's big enough to enjoy when in use, but small enough to slip into your front pocket.. It's also oleophobic, or at least seems that way. Glass is glass, so you'll still need to wipe it down occasionally, but it feels just like the Galaxy S7's also-excellent display.. The Idol 4S's HD display is bright, vibrant, and looks good at all angles.. While a step down from the QHD Android version, Windows 10 Mobile looks excellent in Full HD. Because of the lower resolution, the Idol 4S gets improved battery life. It's a small tradeoff, but I think Alcatel chose wisely in this case. 1920x1080 at 5.5 inches is still a more-than-acceptable 400ppi.. I have no complaints about the Idol 4's display. It's bright, vibrant, and looks good at all angles. It's also smooth to the touch with no perceptible lags. It gets dim at night and bright during the day all at the right levels.. Finally, Alcatel included the option for double-tap to wake and super-sensitive touch aka 'glove mode.' The latter lets you use the display while wearing gloves and is the same tech found in older Lumias.. The only thing missing is the Nokia Glance 'always on' screen from older Lumias. That's not Alcatel's fault; the technology likely belongs to Microsoft or Nokia. While it would have been awesome to have, unfortunately, that is something you must forgo here.. Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 Audio. Featuring dual 1.2W speakers and "Hi-Fi Audio" the Idol 4S has the best audio in any recent Windows phone, bar none.. The speakers are placed at the top and bottom of the device and are forward facing. Nonetheless, there have some cutouts in the rear as well letting the sound "leak" just in case you are not facing the screen. The top speaker also acts as the earpiece for phone calls.. The Idol 4S can get very loud without distortion. When holding the Idol 4S horizontally and watching video e.g. YouTube, you get a stereo-like effect. While the HP Elite x3 also features dual front-facing speakers, the sound quality is markedly better with Idol 4S — another mark towards being a more consumer-friendly media device.. Due to the speaker placement, there is little chance you will obstruct them when holding the device either vertically (like a rear-placed speaker) or horizontally when playing a video game.. Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 Battery. Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 Cameras. The Idol 4S is powered by an ample 3000 mAh non-removable battery. While significantly smaller than the Elite x3's massive 4150 mAh cell, the Idol 4S also has a smaller and lower-resolution display that will demand less juice.. Combined with the improved battery savviness of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 and you have a winning combination of an all-day battery as well as low-heat output. In many ways, it feels like the Elite x3's battery longevity and it can easily push 13 hours with moderate usage.. We used the phone all day for this review's video shoot. I left it off the charger, and the next morning it was still humming at 65% after a full day of regular use — email, music streaming, hopping between Wi-Fi and LTE, etc.. Next to the Elite x3, the Idol 4S gets the second-longest battery life among all Windows phones.. Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 is also on board, letting you power the phone quickly using the included wall charger and USB Type-C cable. Alcatel claims the Idol 4S can recharge fully in 100 minutes, and that seems accurate from my usage. Unfortunately, there is no Qi or PMA wireless charging technology.. Cameras on Windows phones are tricky — the bar was set so high by previous flagship Lumias. Nonetheless, the recent contributions by HP and now Alcatel signal that that gulf between Microsoft/Nokia phones and Microsoft OEM partners is not as drastic as it used to be.. The Idol 4S features a 21 MP rear camera with a Sony sensor and Phase Detection Autofocus. There is also a dual tone flash. It's a decent camera delivering middle of the road photos. During daytime and outdoor shots most people will be quite happy with the results. In low-light and nighttime, you will struggle. The Dual Tone flash is OK producing some decently balanced images although the throw is minimal. Off the cuff, the Elite x3 is slightly better with brighter and sharper images.. The dedicated side camera button is a treat to finally have on a non-Lumia device. The Android version of this phone allows the button to be customized for different functions, but on the Idol 4S with Windows 10 it is just for launching the camera and snapping the shutter. Regardless, it's great to have it here, and I have no criticisms.. Turning to the front and the Idol 4S has a better-than-average 8MP camera producing images at 2448x3264 resolution. The camera shoots wider than the Elite x3, making it adequate for social shots and selfies. The Idol 4S though also has a neat trick with a small LED torch for the front camera. Although it can work in dark settings, it works even better as a fill flash to remove shadows. It's a decent twist and well worth having.. For the average consumer, the camera is likely good enough. But it won't convince Lumia fans.. For the average consumer, the camera is likely good enough. However, due to the current low market share of Windows 10 Mobile the Idol 4S appeals naturally to fans and diehard users of Microsoft's OS. Those people are accustomed to having some of the best imaging around, and the Idol 4S is a good upgrade from the current Lumia line except for imaging where it falls short.. While I think the rear shooter is okay for regular users, it will be hard to convince Lumia fans otherwise. That's a shame for what is otherwise a fantastic phone. I think it's okay to put some of the blame at Microsoft's feet for not giving OEM partners more tools to customize and improve the camera using the SDK.. Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 Virtual Reality. The Idol 4S has some soft focusing and a very sensitive spot metering system. Photos fall into the 'OK' category, but nothing more.. One of the trademark features of the Idol 4S with Windows 10 is Virtual Reality. In fact, in the box, the phone comes with a very nice VR headset to use with the phone. The headset is great quality, comfortable to wear, and has no light leakage.. Personally, I'm not a fan of phone VR. It's a neat intro to the emerging technology, but even on my Galaxy S7, which has a superior VR experience, I have never used it more than twice. To be clear, that is my personal bias and does not represent everyone.. Having said that, the Idol 4S does a decent job with VR and the headset. You drop the phone into the front of the wearable, and it goes into "VR mode" through the VR Launcher. From there you can use things like the two included VR games, VR Store, VR Gallery and more. You can navigate by tilting your head and hitting the two buttons on the bottom front of the headset.. The Windows Store is sparse for VR games, but besides the two included ones (Zombie VR and Captain Fellcraft VR) there are an additional seven titles like Roller Coaster Ride VR and FireWorks VR that can be downloaded. The Zombie game made me a bit queasy due to the motion. You aim using your head and your gun auto-fires. It was clever and mildly amusing. Fellcraft lets you navigate your character through a cave-like experience and was a little more fun.. While Windows 10 Mobile lacks an official YouTube app, Tube360 is pre-installed, letting you browse and watch 360-degree videos on YouTube with ease.. Get the Idol 4S because it's a good phone — VR's neat, but not a strong selling point. One issue with the VR experience (besides the lack of content) is the Full HD display now becomes a bit problematic. You can see pixels on the screen that's barely more than an inch from your eyeballs and blown up further by the headset's lenses. It's not disastrous, but there's a reason why many VR-ready phones are QHD and not just FHD.. Buy the Idol 4S because it's a good phone that gives a peek into the world of VR. Do not expect, however, to be using virtual reality as a daily thing. I consider VR here to be a bonus and more a novelty, but my colleague Richard Devine was more confident in his time with the phone and VR headset.. Kudos, though, to Alcatel for trying something new. They built up the experience as much as they could.. Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 Fingerprint Reader. Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 Continuum. Should you buy the Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 ?. Like the HP Elite x3, the Idol 4S makes use of a rear fingerprint reader to turn on and log into the phone. The sensor is smaller than the Elite x3's, and it lacks the distinctive ridge, which makes it a little harder to feel when you're reaching for it — after all, it's on the back of the phone where you're not looking.. Unlike the Elite x3 and the Lumia 950, however, there is no iris scanner.. Due to its smaller size the area of your finger that it can read is also more limited, so placement can be finicky. It's a nice addition to have, and when combined with double-tap to wake and double-tap to sleep (on the navigation bar) you get an awesome finger-friendly combo.. The Idol 4S is Continuum-enabled, although Alcatel is not promoting that feature too much. After all, this is consumer phone and not geared towards business. There's no included dock with the phone or Alcatel-branded one available, so you'll need to pick one up from Microsoft if you want a desktop-like experience.. Running a Snapdragon 820 and with 3.5GB of available RAM, the Idol 4S performs just as well as HP's Elite x3. In fact, there is no discernible difference between the two. You'll still run into the same Continuum limitations like being unable to run apps side by side, but that will be addressed with the Windows 10 Creator's Update early next year.. Overall, Continuum on the Idol 4S is as good as it gets, but for consumers, it is still a novelty until Microsoft improves its capabilities.. Small point of interest: I wrote most of this review using Continuum, and it worked great.. The Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 is a fine phone, physically, but a huge part of the experience comes down to the second half of the name: with Windows 10. There's no denying that the current situation with Windows 10 Mobile: it's in a barely-registering distant third place behind Android and iPhone, and the Windows Store still is struggling to fill the app needs of customers as comprehensively as Android and iOS.. Nonetheless, Microsoft is actively pushing OS updates every few weeks. As we wrote this review, Windows 10 Mobile build 14393.448 was released, which the Idol 4S promptly received with no carrier interference. That's normal for these phones and a markedly better experience over Android.. A huge part of the experience comes down to the second half of the name: with Windows 10. Personally, I use Windows 10 Mobile every day. Not because it's my job (it's not) and it's not because I don't have other phones (I have an iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S7), but because I prefer it. Sure, I don't have Snapchat, but is that really such a loss?. Pick something that you like and want. Windows 10 Mobile is here to stay, regardless of what tech media may say.. I mention all that because the Idol 4S is honestly one of the best Windows 10 Mobile devices to date. The camera is not the greatest, but other than that it's a fantastic phone. Reception is strong, the display is gorgeous, battery life is outstanding, and the phone is just stunning.. The only caveat – besides the mediocre camera and no NFC – would be that this phone is SIM locked to T-Mobile in the US. That's a shame for people who are stuck on other carriers. I've dabbled with T-Mobile over the years, and they recently put up towers near my abode, finally making them a viable choice. I'm on the prepaid $30 a month plan (unlimited text, 5GB data, 100 minutes for talk) and I'm almost at the point of making it my main line over AT&T.. If you're in the US, consider getting a no-contract prepaid SIM and trying out the service. From there, you can decide to get the Idol 4S.. Alcatel and Microsoft are silent on the issue of the Idol 4S going SIM unlocked or being sold elsewhere. I sure hope they do, because while T-Mobile is a great carrier, I think this phone deserves a large audience even if it's just the diehards. At $469 and with included VR the Idol 4S is a very welcome addition to the small Windows 10 Mobile family.. No NFC or Tap to Pay. Only on T-Mobile in the US (for now). VR is more of a novelty.

Extremely high pixel density screen (534 ppi). The Alcatel Idol 4s features a metal frame and glass body, some accents that make it stand out in the crowd. The phone has a 5.5" display with Quad HD resolution and is powered by the Snapdragon 652 chip. Other specs include 3 gigs of RAM, 32GB of internal, expandable storage, 16 megapixel main camera and 8 megapixel front shooter. The Idol 4s is running Android 6.0 Marshmallow.. Alcatel Idol 4S Review Alcatel Idol 4s benchmarks. Dimensions: 6.06 x 2.97 x 0.28 inches (153.9 x 75.4 x 6.99 mm). Weight: 5.26 oz (149 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Materials: Main body: Glass; Accents: Metal. Display Physical size: 5.5 inches. Resolution: 1440 x 2560 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. 2560x1440 (QHD), 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (60 fps), 1280x720 (720p HD) (120 fps). Octa-core, 1800 MHz, ARM Cortex-A72 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 13.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 17.5 days (420 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 28, 20, 8, 3, 1, 7.

Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. posted by Stephen S.. 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. Introduction The smartphone market is all too often one of extremes. It's easy to throw down $700 on a new phone and expect screaming performance, innovative new features, and an attractive design incorporating plenty of premium-feeling materials. It's also easy to cut every corner you can find, delivering a phone that captivates shoppers with its incredibly low price tag – while leaving them wanting just about everywhere else. What's much trickier, though, is setting proper expectations in the middle-of-the-road $200-to-$500 space. Which aspects of the phone do we still demand a lot from, and which are we willing to let slide in the name of value? And dare we even ask for a few extra bonuses along the way? With the new Idol 4S , Alcatel is attempting to walk that tightrope, giving us a $400 smartphone that's well built, offers competitive performance, and can hook shoppers up with extras like the custom-designed VR headset it comes contained in. In the box: Alcatel Idol 4S Micro USB cable Fast charging adapter Feature guide SIM tool JBL earbuds Alcatel VR goggles Design Alcatel's really intent on drawing attention to those speakers One of the first things you're likely to notice about the Idol 4S's design is that the phone's glass (which you'll find both front and back) doesn't quite stretch all the way to the handset 's top and bottom edges. Instead, you have a few millimeters of metal frame sticking out, housing the phone's stereo speakers. Oddly, the speaker grilles are visible on the phone's front and back alike, though the speakers themselves only face forward. The other component that really screams for attention is the phone's side-mounted circular “Boom key” button, a multi-purpose interface for calling upon a number of software features. Its look is reminiscent of the power button on older Xperia models. Those two idiosyncrasies aside, the Idol 4S is pretty standard-looking smartphone fare. You've got a raised camera bump on the back, flanked by its LED flash and sitting atop a rear fingerprint scanner. Down on the bottom edge there's your (oddly off-center) micro USB port; the headphone jack lives up top. On the phone's right side, above the Boom key, resides the volume rocker, while the left edge is populated by the power button and combo SIM/microSD tray. Display Quad HD on a mid-priced phone is nothing to shake a stick at We love it when mid-rangers share the same sort of components we see in high-end flagships, and Alcatel is giving us just such a high-quality part in the form of the Idol 4S's 5.5-inch quad-HD (1440 x 2560) AMOLED panel. It's bright, and offers just the sort of overblown-but-still-quite-nice-to-look-at (if somewhat less than accurate) saturation OLED screens are known for. What's a little less successful is Alcatel's attempt to give the Idol 4S a curved-at-the-edge “2.5D” glass effect for its screen. The handset's lines, pinching in down the long edges, sure evoke the general style of phones like the Galaxy S7 edge, but that's not quite what we actually have here. Instead, a thin seam around the periphery reveals a sandwich of multiple glass layers, apparently designed to mimic a curvier phone. Technically, it's a pre-installed 2.5D screen protector , but it's not like anyone's about to pry it off and risk ruining their brand-new phone. Ultimately, it looks OK, but we can't shake the feeling that the Idol 4S is trying too hard to be something it's not.. 6.06 x 2.97 x 0.28 inches. 153.9 x 75.4 x 6.99 mm. 5.97 x 2.99 x 0.31 inches. 151.7 x 76 x 7.8 mm. 6.02 x 3.02 x 0.39 inches. 153 x 76.6 x 9.8 mm. 5.65 x 2.73 x 0.31 inches. 143.6 x 69.45 x 7.99 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Alcatel Idol 4s Compare.

Errr Moto G4 Plus is better at its price because of a better fingerprint sensor, battery endurance as well as the durability factor of having glass on both sides of the phone. If you see price vs specs, that'd be a 9 and this would be a 7 because of 1440p on SD652. 1+3 is a better buy as well as the LG G5 discounted at $410, since they're also 9 for using SD820 at their respective prices..

Maybe the author reviewed this phone with a low expectations attitude to start, thus why this phone (and many others like the Mi5) got surprisingly low scores.. (Posts: 18; Member since: 02 May 2016). posted on 10 Aug 2016, 09:22. Sorry, but I beg to differ. You cover those front grilles, and it mutes the audio output. There might be a tiny amount of bleed-through around back, but these speakers are front-facers only. Even peering in the grille holes with a light, you can see that the speaker components only exist around front.. (Posts: 7; Member since: 25 Jun 2009). posted on 10 Aug 2016, 09:35. I've seen several youtube reviews where the phone is placed face down and there is no loss in audio quality. Perhaps your unit was defective? I'll have mine any day and will see for myself..

The speakers are recessed from the screen, so if the phone is flat on its face, you can still hear them because they're not flush with the table..

There are views on YouTube where the speakers on the front are blocked and the sound comes out the back loud and clear. Again, it sounds like you have a defective unit and you should contact the company for clarification.. posted on 10 Aug 2016, 09:58. Does anyone have any idea what Stephen S. said in the camera section of this review?. (Posts: 1485; Member since: 18 Mar 2012). posted on 10 Aug 2016, 18:42. Can anybody tell me what makes any feature a gimmick?. It seems to me like reviewers pick and choose what is a gimmick and what is not. While they might not use a feature, these extra features might be a selling point to everyone else. Do you want all of the phones to be bare bones? A bit confused about this since theyre going to do something a little bit unique yo make themselves stand out from the rest..

Will the Alcatel Idol 4S GSM Unlocked work on all the AT&T Networks; 850/900/1800/1900, UMTS 2/4/5, LTE 2/4/12 ?. Message 1 of 6. Re: Alcatel Idol 4S GSM Unlocked. @BaiMar I did a little searching and reading to see what I could find about people using this phone on AT&T. All had success, but some of them - at least early on - had to get AT&T to add their IMEI as none were registered with AT&T. Have you bought this phone or are you considering it since it's being offered at a great price?. *The views and opinions expressed on this forum are purely my own.

Re: Alcatel Idol 4S GSM Unlocked. I haven't purchased it yet but most likely will.. I want to stay with the Windows platform and this has a better price point then the 950.. I'm still using my Nokia 925 W8.1!. It's great but MS no longer supports 8.1.. MS claims they'll support W10 through 2019 so for the price the Acatel looks like a good deal.... Message 4 of 6. Re: Alcatel Idol 4S GSM Unlocked. @BaiMar Oh yeah, if you're happy with Windows 8.1 you'll be OK with Windows 10 on just about any device. This is a good price for the phone to boot! Camera is going to be better on the 950, butt that must not be a concern of yours if you're still using a 925. *The views and opinions expressed on this forum are purely my own.

> Microsoft > Windows Phone. We tested the Windows 10 Mobile superphone. Alcatel IDOL 4S with Windows 10 Mobile Review. Alcatel IDOL 4S with Windows 10 Mobile (36 Images). Windows Phone as a platform is going through a very difficult period these days, as the market share is collapsing, developers are switching focus to Android and iOS, and users abandon the operating system for various reasons, including the lack of apps. Microsoft, which is the only one that can change all of these, doesn’t seem to be very interested in saving Windows phones, so the company hasn’t launched any new flagship devices this year. Instead, the company prefers to continue improving Windows 10 Mobile and working with partners on launching their own devices.. Alcatel is one of the companies that believe in Windows phones, so it decided to embrace Windows 10 Mobile with a device that excels in terms of looks and specifications.. The Alcatel IDOL 4S is offered with Windows 10 Mobile after previously being launched with Android in an approach that we’ve already seen before at HTC. The company launched the HTC M8 with Windows Phone after originally having released the device with Android.. On paper, the Alcatel IDOL 4S seems to be one of the best Windows phones to date, so we decided to give it a try to see if this device is as good as so many people claim it to be. Read on to find what the Alcatel IDOL 4S is all about.. Before anything, it’s worth mentioning that the Alcatel IDOL 4S with Windows 10 Mobile received several hardware upgrades over its Android sibling, so it comes with features that make it a flagship in all regards.. In terms of build quality, the IDOL 4S is a beautiful piece of art, and it comes with front and back glass panels and a metal frame. At first glance, the IDOL 4S looks a lot like the Samsung Galaxy S6, and there were many people here at Softpedia who thought we were actually testing a Samsung phone model.. This, however, contributes to a pretty exquisite look, and it’s nice to finally see such a premium feeling on a Windows 10 Mobile device. The same thing happened when we reviewed the HP Elite X3 , so it’s living proof that Microsoft’s partners also have the know-how and the resources to build high-quality devices.. First and foremost, the Alcatel IDOL 4S comes with a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels, with a 71.9 percent screen-to-body ratio and 401 ppi pixel density.. This means the phone has quite small bezels, and you can really feel that when holding it in hand, easily surpassing other high-end phones on the market, such as the iPhone 7 Plus, which has a screen-to-body ratio of 67.7 percent.. The display provides stunning colors and contrast, and it’s just as good as the panel used on more expensive phones out there, but there’s one thing that potential buyers must have in mind.. The IDOL 4S does not support Glance screen, which is kind of a must-have on a Windows phone these days, especially because no other notification system is available - the phone does have a LED, but Windows 10 Mobile doesn’t provide any customization options, so it’s pretty much useless. In other words, you’re stuck with the typical notification system that lights up the screen when receiving a message, even though hardware-wise the phone has what it takes to offer so much more.. Alcatel IDOL 4S Windows 10 Mobile apps. There’s also another thing that we need to mention here. Alcatel decided to use Asahi Dragontrail Glass for scratch protection and not the super common Gorilla Glass, and there’s a good reason for that.. First and foremost, Dragontail is the creation of Japanese company Asahi and has the same role as Gorilla glass. It can protect your phone against scratches, but it’s worth knowing that Gorilla Glass is more effective because its chemical composition is harder. Dragontail is typically used on Japanese phones and low-end models, so Alcatel most likely picked it to keep the price low.. There’s also double-tap to wake, and it works just like expected, mostly because the screen is super-responsive, although we’ve noticed that at random times it’s too responsive and trying to scroll up or down actually translates into a tap that launches an app.. As we’ve said a little bit earlier, the IDOL 4S with Windows 10 Mobile comes with several upgrades over its Android sibling, and one of the biggest differences is the processor.. The Android version of the phone features a Qualcomm MSM8976 Snapdragon 652, whereas the Windows flavor comes with a Qualcomm MSM8996 Snapdragon 820 chip. The processor comes in a quad-core configuration, 2x2.15 GHz Kryo and 2x1.6 GHz Kryo, and is paired with 4 GB RAM, up from 3 GB RAM on Android.. There’s also a GPU upgrade, from Adreno 510 to Adreno 530, as well as more storage, as Windows 10 Mobile users get 64 GB, while Android fans receive only 32 GB storage.. The aforementioned configuration makes the Alcatel IDOL 4S super-fast, and thanks to Windows 10 Mobile optimizations, which are getting better every day, the phone opens apps and performs tasks in a second. It rarely gets hot when performing regular tasks, but it’s cooling down just as fast as it’s heating when launching more demanding apps or games.. We’ve rarely felt the IDOL 4S slow, and when it happened, it was mostly because of Windows 10 Mobile. The operating system is evolving, there’s no doubt about it, but certain improvements here and there are still needed.. The Snapdragon 820 processor, however, puts the Alcatel IDOL 4S alongside the HP Elite X3 in the group of the most powerful Windows phones to date. And when looking at the bigger picture, this is one of the most powerful phones on the market right now, as the 820 chipset is the best mobiles can get these days.. When it comes to cameras, Windows 10 Mobile users also receive more than their Android siblings. The phone comes with a 21-megapixel main camera with the typical feature package, including phase detection autofocus, dual-LED flash, touch focus, HDR, panorama, and other things like that.. The camera can also shoot videos in 2160p @ 30 fps, while front-facing 8-megapixel camera comes with 1080p support and LED flash.. Alcatel IDOL 4S camera - it looks like a Samsung, it feels like a Samsung. Although it does come with some improvements, the Alcatel IDOL 4S still feels slow when taking pics, and you can easily notice the lag after pressing the shutter. The whole thing becomes even more obvious when shooting in burst mode and the camera becomes even slower.. On the other hand, photo quality is generally very good, and we’ve noticed that the majority of pictures have above the average color and contrast settings.. When optimal light is available, the Alcatel IDOL 4S shoots photos with natural colors and balanced contrast. When the amount of light drops, however, the amount of noise also increases, and photo quality is getting worse the darker it gets.. Alcatel IDOL 4S camera sample with optimal light. Taking photos in complete darkness is impossible, and videos recorded in low light seem to suffer from the same focus issue that we’ve complained about before: the phone often loses the focus point and refocusing is needed, but this is clearly a software bug that can be addressed in a future update.. All in all, it’s not the best camera we’ve seen, but it’s one of the best, especially in the Windows Phone lineup. We’ve heard many people saying that the Lumia 950 XL still has the best camera in the Windows Phone world, and we’d put the Alcatel not too far behind it.. Just like the Android version, the Alcatel IDOL 4S comes with a 3,000 non-removable li-ion battery which easily gets the job done. In plain English, it can get you an average of one day per charge, obviously depending on the things you do on your phone.. On average, we got nearly 30 hours of battery life with moderate usage, and this involves using Twitter and reddit a couple of hours per day, browsing, emails, calls for nearly an hour, and WhatsApp chats. We didn’t test it with games because it’s pretty clear that battery performance here can be very different from one person to another.. “ At least one day per charge. The device comes with a USB Type-C slot for recharging, and the entire process takes nearly 70 minutes to complete from less than 10 percent. This is when the phone gets hot, but it’s obviously normal.. There is no wireless charging and no fast charging, which is quite a setback, but you should be fine with it given the fact that charging doesn’t take too long.. The Alcatel IDOL 4S is one of the phones that support Continuum, so you can connect it to a larger screen and convert it into an almost fully-featured PC running Windows 10 Mobile. The experience is very similar to the one with the HP Elite X3, and you can read more about it here .. The IDOL 4S comes with a fingerprint reader for Windows Hello, so you can configure it from the Settings app to protect your phone the easy way. This is a feature that brings it in line with other high-end phones on the market already coming with a fingerprint sensor, and one of the things we’ve missed the most on the Lumia 950 XL.. Surprisingly, the Alcatel IDOL 4S has quite a fast sensor and scanning usually takes place correctly, although unlocking the phone per se takes more time than on an iPhone, for instance. Although, the finger needs to be dry and clean.. The fingerprint sensor is placed on the back, just like it’s the case on the HP Elite X3, but as compared to HP’s model, it doesn’t come with a more prominent border. Given the fact that the back is entirely made of glass, it takes a while to get used to the position of the sensor, so you might have a hard time scanning your finger without looking at first.. The phone also comes with a dedicated camera button, and while this is, in essence, a good thing, there’s something that’s really odd. The camera button is placed exactly where you’d expect the lock button to be, so it happened several times during the test to press it when I actually wanted to lock or unlock the phone. And what’s worse is that there are no options to change this in Windows 10 Mobile.. And last but not least, the phone features stereo speakers, and they’re quite loud, although they lack the bass that we’ve seen on other high-end devices. It’s still a pleasure to watch videos, though, and talking on the phone with the speaker in a noisy place is not at all an issue.. We said it before, and we’re saying it again: Windows 10 Mobile is just not there yet. Devices like the HP Elite X3 and the Alcatel IDOL 4S show that Windows 10 Mobile has a lot of potential to compete against Android and iOS, but due to several shortcomings, it’s still lagging behind its rivals.. One of the reasons is the lack of apps, but we’ve talked about this in the past, and we’re not going to do it again because everyone knows why this is happening.. But at the same time, the Alcatel IDOL 4S comes with hardware that Windows 10 Mobile customers can’t use because there’s no software support in the operating system.. “ Windows 10 Mobile not ready just yet. And the best example is the LED notification light. Although the phone does feature such tech, you can’t enable and configure it, and this is quite an issue given the fact that there’s no Glance screen available.. On the other hand, Windows 10 Mobile is improving, and the operating system is much faster and stable now than it was at first. Apps load quicker, everything is more responsive and crashes almost never happen.. If you’re not the kind of user who’s into apps and like Windows 10 Mobile, there’s no doubt you’re going to be pleased with it. Everything is exactly where it’s supposed to be, and given the fact that Windows 10 Mobile looks and feels a lot like Windows 10, the entire operating system is super-familiar to PC users.. Alcatel IDOL 4S - Windows 10 Mobile, still the most beautiful OS out there. Dammit, Microsoft! Get your stuff together and make Windows 10 Mobile worth the effort because this phone deserves a better operating system.. The Alcatel IDOL 4S is without a doubt one of the most awesome Windows phones on the market, and it features pretty much everything you’d want on a phone.. As compared to the HP Elite X3, it has the dimensions of a phone addressed to those without ridiculously-sized hands, and with a little effort, it can also be used with one hand.. It’s fast and responsive, it has an awesome screen, and the battery lasts at least one day, which is in line with the majority of other high-end phones currently on the market. Furthermore, it comes with support for Continuum, which many believe is the feature of mobile, so you won’t feel left behind when the Windows 10 Creators Update brings new options such as window support in Continuum.. The IDOL 4S is also the first phone that pushes Windows 10 Mobile in the VR world, but as we’ve said, this is an industry that needs many more investments from Microsoft and its partners. But it once again shows the potential of this phone, which pushes Windows 10 Mobile beyond its limits.. In the end, Alcatel proved that Windows 10 Mobile deserves a chance. With the right phone and the right software improvements, Windows 10 Mobile can truly become a rival to Android and iOS. Of course, not without apps, but let’s not talk apps today.. # Alcatel # Windows 10 Mobile # Windows Phone # Alcatel IDOL 4S # smartphone review.

A hidden gem from MWC, the Alcatel Idol 4S is a phone that impresses for a pretty low price point given the spec list.. Design Interface and OS Battery and camera Early verdict. The Alcatel Idol 4S – apart from that moniker sounding a little late, given that was everywhere four years ago – is a quietly impressive phone with high-end specs but a lower price.. For years, Alcatel has been bringing out phones with a decent spec at a low price... but not overly successfully, as the user experience didn't quite add up.. That seems to have changed with the launch of the Alcatel Idol 4 and 4S, which have dialled up the premium experience without adding too much to the price.. Well, the Idol 4S doesnt; quite hit that sweet spot of low, low price as it's coming for €449 (Around $500 / £350 / AU$680), which is at the higher end of the spectrum for a phone like this. But the spec list is strong – and for some of the features it's packing, the price is great.. The mix of metal, plastic and glass is neat here - again, it's a little on the light side (like the Idol 4) which means that it feels a little cheap in the hand, but the build quality is solid and the chassis has a pleasant feel. I was a fan of the matte plastic of the Idol 3, but this definitely feels like an upgrade.. The power button is in the top right-hand corner of the phone, which is fine when you're using it normally. However, one of the key features of the Idol 4S is the ability to use it either way up, meaning you can pick it up from either end and use it fine.. The power button then sits under your right thumb knuckle though, which is useless. You can double tap the screen to wake it or hit the Boom Key on the side (more on this later) but this doesn't shut the display off when you're done, meaning that power button is in an irritating place.. If it was where the Boom Key is in the side, looking for all the world like a Sony power button, it would make so much more sense.. However, that screen is worth talking about - an AMOLED QHD resolution screen that looks great at 5.5-inches. It doesn't feel massive in the hand either, and is a nice upgrade from Alcatel - firmly helping to justify the price tag.. The other big upgrade is the four speaker layout, pumping sound towards you when you're holding the phone (from the top and bottom of the handset) but also firing it rearwards as well, giving a real 360 sound when you're putting it down on the table.. If this thing had a screen on the back, the Idol 4S would be able to work no matter which way you picked it up. Something to consider for the Idol 5, guys.. The Alcatel interface, running Android 6, is nothing amazing to shout about - but then again, with the maturity that Google's OS is showing at the moment, that's not bad thing.. It looks sleek and clean, has all the right apps in the right places that you'd expect, and generally fits as you'd hope. There are little flourishes here and there: a fold out music widget when you press the icon, or opening the full music app and turning the phone on its side to see a DJ interface where you can mix and scratch your records and annoy the LIFE out of anyone nearby.. In terms of raw spec, some will turn their nose up a little when they see the raw data: a Snapdragon 652 XPU and 3GB of RAM. However, don't be fooled by the mid-level CPU from Qualcomm - we're in a world where only the toughest of tasks need the high end engines, and with 3GB of RAM there's loads that can be done here without slowing your phone down.. The Boom Key (told you I'd get there eventually) is an interesting addition: you can use it to enhance audio, show the weather as an animation or create an instant collage with all your photos just with a tap - it all depends which app you're in at the time.. You can even re-map this to another task if you wanted, so making this the power button is an option - although you'll lose its special qualities.. The Alcatel Idol 4S comes with a 3000mAh battery inside, which is a pretty good level for a phone of this size. I'm curious to see how well the brand can manage its power with a QHD screen in the mix, but with Android 6 on board there's a big hope it won't be terrible.. This isn't Qualcomm's absolute best chipset though, so if we're marginal on battery life, that's not going to help.. The camera is a 16MP sensor from Sony, giving sharp and clear images when you're snapping about. Combining the pictures with the QHD AMOLED screen means they always look great - but only if you've taken a great picture.. While our early results looked OK, there was nothing mind-blowing here. Well, apart from the fact you can make your phone meow like a cat or bleat like a sheep to get the attention of your subject.. You'd think that was for kids - but in testing it made someone look up EVERY SINGLE TIME.. Alcatel has been the dark horse of MWC 2016 - bringing out two pretty competent phones with a good spec list and low(ish) cost. Combined with a maturing Android OS, it's a good mix to see, and there's a reason the brand is starting to see some traction in places like the US.. Will the Idol 4S be a real consideration for someone thinking about buying the LG G5 or Samsung Galaxy S7? Probably not - it's a different beast for a lot less money than those flagships.. But it's a great step forward for Alcatel, and one that should be richly applauded.. What is a hands on review?.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 heads to T-Mobile Nov. The phone will cost $470 and hit stores on November 10. Customers also get a free pair of Idol 4S VR Goggles.. November 1, 2016 7:55 AM PDT. The Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10.. Remember Windows 10 for phones ? Apparently, Alcatel does.. The Chinese handset maker said on Tuesday a version of its Idol 4S phone equipped with Microsoft 's operating system will head to T-Mobile on November 11. The phone will cost $470, and will include a pair of Idol 4S VR Googles. The company is also offering a 45-day trial of Hulu Plus and a 30-day trial of Microsoft's Groove music service. Lastly, they'll get a copy of the Windows 10 Mobile game Halo: Spartan Assault.. Windows 10 is all but a forgotten memory when it comes to phones, but smaller companies like Alcatel have kept the OS alive. Even Microsoft has written off its phone ambitions for the year, opting not to release a flagship in 2016.. The Idol 4S was originally an Android phone and the company's flagship phone, but Alcatel has been keen on embracing Windows 10.. Be respectful, keep it clean and stay on topic.

Alcatel Idol 4s review A great smartphone, needing a little refinement. by John Velasco July 22, 2016. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. - Camera can produce great shots. - Comes in an awesome bundle. - Great price point for the bundle. - SoC is slower than rival similar-priced flagships. - Camera is hit and miss. - Design lacks a little bit of refinement. The Idol 4S undoubtedly delivers several welcome improvements over the cheaper Idol 3 and a worthy successor it is, but in an increasingly-competitive industry, the Idol 4S may not be the best smartphone you can buy for $399.. Processor Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor. MicroSD expansion Yes, up to 512GB. Connectivity Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Wi-Fi Direct,. NFC, Micro USB 2.0, Bluetooth 4.2. Dimensions 153.9 x 75.4 x 6.99mm. Alcatel made some noise last year with the release of the OneTouch Idol 3 as an affordable and attractive package that caught the eye of consumers.Â. The OneTouch Idol 3 was very much a budget-friendly mid-range smartphone, but while its Alcatel may have dropped the OneTouch branding with its successor, the Idol 4S improves on it by offering better specs at an equally affordable price tag. On paper, the smartphone definitely looks the part, but does it deliver?. With a few tweaks since the version we saw at MWC, is the Idol 4S a smash hit or does it fail to live up to the hype of its predecessor? Letâs find out in this, our Alcatel Idol 4S review.. After what can only be dubbed a successful 2015, Alcatel is attempting to progress with its smartphone offering, and the Idol 4S comes wrapped in a build that is beautifully designed and far more premium in nature when compared to last yearâs product.. Thanks to its glass-meets-metal construction and the contours of the edges, the Idol 4S reminds us of recent Samsung flagships, yet it doesnât have the refinement of the Galaxy S7. Instead, it has the same rough edges that the Galaxy S6 did, and itâs definitely very nice to hold in the phone.. What makes it a little rough are some of the design choices, in particular the boom key. One of the key features of the Idol 4S, this has some unique features â more on that below â but is designed like and placed where a power button normally would be, which is odd at best.. Whereâs the power button we hear you ask? Well itâs in the upper left corner and this means youâre always having to use your index button to operate it. In fact, if Alcatel were to offer the ability to swap these two buttons around, the Idol 4S would be a more appealing smartphone.. As we mentioned at the top, the Idol 4S has had a few tweaks since Mobile World Congress, and the release version actually sports a fingerprint sensor on the back. The sensor works well enough â when you can find it that is â but as itâs not recessed, it can be very difficult to locate immediately. Alcatel is including free cases as part of the Idol 4S bundle and these help to differentiate the fingerprint sensor from the rest of the smartphone.. Without doubt, audio is becoming a very important part of todayâs smartphone experience and the Idol 4S doesnât skimp in this department, with two front-facing 3.6-watt JBL certified speakers. The audio is powerful and sounds clean, and considering the price, are definitely very impressive.. Overall, the Idol 4S is certainly an impressively-designed smartphone and the switch to a glass-meets-metal design by Alcatel has proven itself to be a worthy successor. Itâs not perfect, and needs a little refinement, but the design is definitely a plus.. Last yearâs Idol 3 offered Full HD resolution but this year, Alcatel have gone one step further by procuring a 5.5-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED panel from Samsung that certainly looks the part at first glance.. The display definitely increases the appeal of the device and with a max brightness of over 600 nits, itâs one of the brightest on the market. However, the screen is on the cooler side with its 7500 K color temperature and tends to produce saturated, unrealistic colors.. Itâs not necessarily a bad thing but itâs also not entirely accurate, but itâs a minor quibble with what is otherwise a rather impressive display. You get the standard vivid colors and deep, vibrant blacks offered by a Samsung Super AMOLED panel â likely from a couple of years ago â without having to pay a large amount for it.. Under the hood is where the Idol 4S seems to have had cutbacks, at least on paper. Powered by a Snapdragon 652 processor with 3GB of RAM and an Adreno 510 GPU, the Idol 4S doesnât quite appear to be on a par with devices like the Axon 7 and Xiaomi Mi 5 which all offer the newest Snapdragon 820 processor at a similar price point.. The Snapdragon 652 is comprised of a quad-core 1.8GHz Cortex-A72 chipset and a quad-core 1.4GHz Cortex-A3 chipset, both arranged in a big.LITTLE formation. The Snapdragon 652 SoC does hold up under most conditions but it certainly isnât on the same level as the Snapdragon 820 and as such, you can expect to find a few glitches in performance during resource intensive tasks such as gaming. For day-to-day general usage, the Snapdragon 652 is more than capable and it definitely goes the full mile.. 32GB storage also comes as standard on the Idol 4S and out of the box, youâll have around 24GB available to use. Luckily, this can be expanded using the inclusive microSD card slot â which replaces the second SIM card slot â and lets you increase the storage by up to 256GB, although we donât recommend using a card thatâs full as read times can be particularly painful.. Call quality is surprisingly great with this smartphone. The volume output is pretty strong through the earpiece and also on speakerphone, but itâs made better with the clear tone of its quality. Voices have strong emphasis, which makes it even a breeze to chit chat when thereâs some ambient noise around.. Elsewhere, other notable hardware features include Hi-Fi Audio through the excellent speakers, microUSB v2.0 (no USB-C here sadly), compatibility with Alcatelâs VR Googles and the usual plethora of connectivity options including dual-band Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC and support for all US LTE bands (2, 4, 5, 7, 12, 17). If you need an affordable unlocked phone that works across GSM networks in the US, the Idol 4S certainly meets this requirement.. Under the hood, the Idol 4S is powered by a 3,000mAh non-removable battery that is quoted as offering up to two-days battery life. In general usage, the Idol 4S gets to 1.5 days with ease and with minimal usage, you can eek out two days with the device. For the most demanding users, it should be able to get through a full dayâs usage.. For the times when your device is running low, the Idol 4S offers quick charging and can be charged to full in just under 90 minutes or to 60% in just 30 minutes. Itâs not the fastest charging on the market but it is on par with most major current flagships. Overall, the battery isnât the absolute best but firmly ranks as better-than-average and for the price point, is certainly impressive.. The improvements from Idol 3 to Idol 4S donât end there as the camera also gets a welcome bump, with a new 16MP rear Sony sensor with f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus and a dual-LED dual tone flash.. The camera produces details that are sufficient and colors tend to be rich in tone, but the Idol 4S struggles with dynamic range, as brighter areas tend to be overexposed. HDR does go someway to solving this problem which adjusts the exposure throughout the range but tends to make the photo appear a bit artificial.. For the most part, the camera is certainly capable and on par with others in this range but itâs not the greatest smartphone shooter and tends to be a little hit-and-miss. The lack of OIS proves to be a costly miss as shoots in both low light and day light can appear to be noisy.. In most low light conditions, the Idol 4S camera does struggle and pictures come out noisy and more susceptible to blurring. The auto-focus doesnât quite nail exposure in low light photos but manually selecting the focal point can help find the right exposure for better low light images.. Overall, the camera certainly isnât the best in an affordable flagship but itâs more than functional. While it mostly gets the job done, itâs worth noting that other devices do offer a better camera experience at a similar price point.. The Idol 4S runs Android Marshmallow with a few of Alcatelâs UX flourishes on top and for the most part, itâs one of the more pleasant interfaces on the market. By trying to remain faithful to the stock experience, the Idol 4S UX endears itself to purists and customizers alike.. Basic users will appreciate the simplicity and straightforwardness it offers, but power users will find themselves wanting more as the Idol 4S doesnât quite have the feature set of a power-user-friendly OEM interface like Samsungâs TouchWiz.. The simplest way to describe the Idol 4S software experience is that it is very much one-step-at-a-time; while other interfaces do offer robust multitasking and are optimised for doing multiple things at once, the Idol 4S takes a more simplistic approach. It gets the job doneâ¦ for the average consumer.. On the team, both Nirave and I have the Idol 4S and neither of us finds the boom key particularly useful. In truthful honesty, if the Idol 4S didnât have a boom key, we wouldnât be too upset and hence Alcatel allowing users to swap the functions of the power and boom keys would help improve the overall experience.. The Idol 4S may not be the perfect smartphone but it does deliver in several departments and considering the price, itâs definitely a worth contender in the affordable flagship battle.. When launched stateside, the Idol 4S will come as part of a bundle that includes Virtual Reality Goggles, JBL headphones in the box (which are very, very good), a screen protector and a free case from Incipio and at a pre-order price of $349.99, the Idol 4S is definitely great value for money.. If you choose not to pre-order the handset and instead wait for it to go on sale, itâll cost you $399.99 and at this price, itâs still a very good purchase but it is in the range of slightly better handsets such as the ZTE Axon 7. Overall though, the Idol 4S is definitely a purchase we recommend though.. So there you have it, our in-depth review of the Alcatel Idol 4S and itâs clear that Alcatel has certainly made some huge strides since the Idol 3. In a bid to create an excellent smartphone that is still affordable, Alcatel did have to cut a few corners but this is to be expected and for the most part, it doesnât quite detract away from the experience.. Itâs always worth remembering that Alcatel isnât just selling a phone here and instead, theyâre selling a bundled experience. At the price of $400, the Idol 4S goes head to head with the likes of the Axon 7 and the OnePlus 3 and for the most part, it very much splits these two devices.. Last yearâs starting price of $250 for the Idol 3 was undeniably head turning but at $400, the Idol 4S is tougher to like. Thatâs not to say we donât; the affordable flagship market is ever increasingly competitive and the Idol 4S is definitely a worthy contender for this title.

Alcatel Idol 4S review: Too much money for too little phone. 2016/07/27 11:12am PST Jul 27, 2016. Alcatel Idol 4S News Phone Reviews. "That looks like a cheap Gear VR knockoff.". It is much less comfortable (at least for me! Note that it may be just fine for some people). It is much more annoying to control. The gyroscope makes motion tracking jittery and disorienting to a nauseating extent. There is far, far less content than the Oculus Store. It does work with Google Cardboard and, thus, YouTube, which GearVR does not. The field of view is inferior (90 versus 96 for Gear VR). The setup process is confusing or at least unreliable. Single tap to turn on display. Press and hold to take burst photos. Press on lockscreen to show weather animation. Various functions when pressed in a particular app:. Toggle surround sound mode (???) while watching videos (unclear if this is only in Alcatel's content app Littlestar). Boost the loudness and bass of speakers while listening to music (presumably only stock apps, again). Increase clarity and loudness while on a call. Create a photo collage while viewing moments in gallery (what). Apply video effects when watching a video (also what). Start a live stream video from the camera app (via an app called TiZR or something, which, alright). As a boost button in Asphalt Overdrive (really). Tap to launch camera at any time. 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Hardware and design 4 Display 5 Battery life 6 Storage and wireless 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 8.1 Performance 9 VR 10 Software 11 Conclusion. Last year, Alcatel made its first real foray into the US unlocked smartphone market with the Idol 3. That phone cost $249, but at the time, offered quite a bit for the money. A large 5.5" 1080p display (with a fairly good LCD panel), dual front-facing speakers, no real bloatware to speak of, LTE, solid cameras (13MP/8MP), and a microSD card slot. High on features, low on price may as well have been the tagline for the Idol 3, and while it was at times excruciatingly slow owing to its Snapdragon 615 chipset, I found it an overall good value proposition. It was a phone that, to me, said "here are $250 in smartphone parts combined with a relatively unadulterated Android." Sure, it took forever to get Marshmallow (and likely won't get Nougat), but I don't think it's a stretch to say that wasn't surprising.. So, now we have the Idol 4S, the Idol 3's spiritual and alphanumerical successor. Gone, mercifully, is the whole "OneTouch" branding, it's now just an Alcatel Idol 4S. The formula seems largely the same: good components, relatively "vanilla" Android. Dual front-facing speakers (that also work when the phone is face-down)? Still there. Relatively premium, if not particularly exciting, look and feel? Yep. Hell, this phone even has a fairly amazing screen - a 5.5-inch 2K Super AMOLED panel makes for a wonderful canvas, nav button burn-in be damned. They've even added a fingerprint scanner, a customizable function button, Qualcomm Quick Charge (quick charger included), a glass rear cover, JBL earbuds, and a box that is also a VR headset!. And you, good consumer, might say "Wow! That sounds like a heck of a package." And you'd be right. But, you might also then say "So last year's phone was $249, this one is definitely nicer, so it's what, $279? $299?" And you'd be so wrong. (Though it's available for $349 on pre-order until August 2nd.). Has Alcatel managed to insert $400 of value into a phone running with a Snapdragon 652 chipset that is competing against devices like the OnePlus 3, sharply discount Nexus 6Ps, and ZTE's upcoming Axon 7? Well, no.. Alcatel has sourced a pretty great 2K Super AMOLED panel for this phone (the alleged reasoning being VR). Bright, vivid, crisp, and great viewing angles. The Idol 4S's speakers are loud, but more importantly, they sound good. You get real mid-range and true stereo with these dual front-facing speakers, like the BoomSound of the good old days. The Snapdragon 652 processor provides very respectable performance, and is leagues faster than Qualcomm's older 615/616/617 parts thanks to its advanced ARM A72 CPU cores. A newer, more powerful Adreno GPU helps, too. Alcatel doesn't mess with Android much, and it. doesn't put any paid preloads on its. Any included apps are there because Alcatel thinks they improve the experience or add to functionality, and I find that largely true. And the couple of preinstalled VR games that don't meet that definition can be uninstalled. Last year's Idol 3 didn't have any sort of quick charging, so the addition of QC3.0 on this year's phone is exceptionally welcome.. This one's easy - the phone is blatantly overpriced. This is a $300 phone - at best - in a $400 phone's fancy box. The value just is not here, and the notion that the VR headset and some bundled headphones help justify that MSRP is a non-starter. I don't want to say the Idol 4S's battery life is poor, but it's not great. Average for what I'd expect of a phone with its display size/resolution and battery capacity. But certainly not great, or even very good. While capable of producing good shots in the right conditions, performance in adverse lighting is highly unpredictable and often poor, and the HDR mode is just plain weird. See the section for more, but this is a Bad VR Headset. Bad design, bad implementation, bad UX. It's a wonder to me that they thought this would be well-received. Remember the first fingerprint scanners? Remember how slow they were? That's how this one is. And it's glass surrounded by glass, meaning it's extra frustrating to use.. The camera module and glass rear cover have caused the Idol 4S to be the butt of Galaxy knockoff jokes since it was announced. But it doesn't look they were especially trying to avoid such comparisons, particularly given the design of the camera module. The similarities do end there, however; calling it an ape of Samsung's design language doesn't really seem appropriate unless viewed through a rather narrow lens (pun intended). Now, the suspicious side of me wants to say this smacks of subtle consumer manipulation: from afar, someone thinks they see a Galaxy phone - a well-known brand - but closer inspection will immediately reveal this to be an Alcatel device. But it's possible I'm reading too much into this.. Alcatel has retained the "stepped" edges on the top and bottom of the phone where the output of the dual 3.6W speakers is routed. This gives the phone an interesting fascia that I don't think you'll find elsewhere in the smartphone world. As design flourishes go, it's a subtle one, but it does possibly serve a functional purpose by sequestering the edges of the display's glass cover away from the physical borders of the device. I also personally think it looks nice, but that's subjective.. The move to a glass rear cover, I think, is misguided. It has made the phone exceptionally slippery, but given that Alcatel supplied me with three cases for the Idol 4S as part of my review kit, the switch seems rooted in the idea that most people buying these phones will put them in a protective housing. That's always struck me as an odd justification for glass on the back of the phone, though, and without a case that Idol 4S's exceptionally smooth and slippery backside has caused it to fall off my desk, end table, and sofa numerous times. Even Samsung's latest phones aren't quite so... The body housing is aluminum, with chamfered and polished edges that give the phone a decidedly sharp look in bright light. While I'm not exactly a fan of flashy phones, I think it works here. Overall, I like the way this phone looks, though I am less of a fan of the way it feels: a bit sharp in the hand and really effing slippery. Speaking of feel, Alcatel has chosen to place its fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone, which I maintain is where it should be absent a dedicated physical home button. The problem is that the scanner is also covered in glass, and the circular indentation is not especially easy to feel out. Eventually, you'd likely develop some muscle memory for this - it's gotten easier even in my week-plus using the phone - but it just seems sub-optimal. Again: a case solves this issue, because the cutout for the scanner makes its location far more physically obvious. It doesn't help that the fingerprint scanner itself is also painfully slow, making for constant self-questioning of whether you actually hit the damn thing.. Alcatel has placed the phone's power key on the left as it did with the Idol 3, and the volume rocker sits on the right. Below the volume rocker is a circular button Alcatel has dubbed the "BOOM" key, which is a term I am going to politely refuse to utter again. This function key is customizable, but also has a good number of built-in features that you can choose to use (versus setting up your own functionality). We'll get back to that later.. On the bottom is the offset microUSB (no USB-C here) port, and atop the phone is the 3.5mm jack. As for anecdotes about "solidness" and "quality," I'll say the Idol 4S doesn't feel cheap , but neither does any phone that's wrapped in glass and aluminum. To put it bluntly, I think it's time to just drop these terms: they don't mean anything. A phone's outward "quality" can only be judged so far as any imperfections that are apparent in its construction, and even so, such imperfections don't speak to actual quality. In that sense, nothing about the Idol 4S sticks out as being bad, and nor does it look like a phone designed around exceptional assembly tolerances (think Samsung). It's a glass and aluminum brick, and that's kind of the trick, isn't it? It's hard not to associate "premium" and "quality" with these materials, because they're what we've been told are "premium quality" materials.. While it doesn't have the ultra-bright high-contrast mode that Samsung's Super AMOLED panels do for enhanced outdoor visibility, this 2K panel more than gets the job done. The Idol 3 had a great screen for the money last year, this phone has a great screen for the money - even at $400 - this year. But Alcatel allows you to customize the display mode in a couple of ways.. First, you can set the colors to "natural" (i.e. something resembling sRGB) or "vivid" (i.e. Second, you can set the temperature of the display to cool, standard, or warm, depending on how you like your whites balanced. It's just enough configurability to make me happy, and while most owners will never touch it, I like that they've provided this. The more accurate mode is especially useful when reviewing photos, as it gives me a much better sense how they'll look to people using other devices (mainly, iPhones).. 2K resolution on a 5.5" display is arguably in the gray area approaching overkill, but it's so common now that we don't blink at it. Alcatel's reasoning for using a Super AMOLED Quad HD part was their VR headset, which does make sense if the VR solution is actually anything to write home about (it isn't).. Minimum brightness dips pretty dang low, though not quite so low as that of recent phones from Samsung. But for reading at night, I think this gets the job done - Samsung's lowest brightness setting is almost too dim for me even in total darkness, and the Idol 4S definitely isn't going to make seared ahi of your retinas come bedtime. The benefits of AMOLED continue to far outstrip the downsides, in my opinion, and even with nav button burn-in essentially assured long-term, I can't say I even care. I'll gladly take my inky blacks, wonderful contrast, superb viewing angles, and ultra low-persistence VR experience over being able to tout that my display won't have barely-visible marks on it two years from now. Nobody truly cares about this outside the internet.. In my experience so far, I'd say battery life on the Idol 4S is... It gets the kind of longevity I'd expect for a phone of this display size (5.5" QHD) and battery capacity (3000mAh). Would I happily accept 10 to 20 grams more heft and a millimeter or two of thickness to bump this phone up to a 3500mAh cell? Without question.. Here's the thing: while the Idol 4S's battery life today is acceptable for a modern smartphone - 3 hours and change screen-on time in my particular usage pattern (which is not comparable to yours - I don't mean to be a jerk, but this needs to be made clear) - it will get worse over time. As more apps are put on the phone, as the cell starts to degrade, this phone won't last as long. As is, the battery life is not exceptional, and Alcatel offers nothing but Android's stock battery saver mode to improve it. A QHD Super AMOLED screen is going to drink power expeditiously outdoors, and I found this made the Idol 4S a somewhat poor Pokemon GO partner.. For $400, this does give me pause. While the OnePlus 3 also has a 3000mAh battery and a 5.5" screen, it has the benefit of a 1080p display that consumes less power. Dash charging is also faster than Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 (which the Idol 4S supports). So I guess I'd say this: the Idol 4S doesn't have poor battery life. But with the many months it took the Idol 3 to get Marshmallow, I have to wonder how long Idol 4S owners will be left waiting for Android 7.0's Doze "lite" mode, which may be just what the 4S needs to future-proof that slightly worrying battery capacity.. So, the Idol 4S gets a pass on battery life for now, but given how many other areas of the phone got an upgrade over the Idol 3, not to mention the big price bump, I'm slightly disappointed the battery wasn't enlarged. As is, a Galaxy S7 edge has a battery 20% larger than this phone's with a display of the same size and resolution. It's just something to think about.. The Idol 4S has 32GB of internal storage, with around 22-23GB that will actually be available to you out of the box. As far as I can tell, the Idol 4S's various preloaded apps add up to around 600MB of space used, about half of which you can reclaim by uninstalling two VR games. Pretty much everything else can be disabled, if you so desire.. How fast is that storage? Thankfully, much faster than the outgoing Idol 3's. Compared to today's current flagships? My strong suspicion is that Alcatel is using the same eMMC 5.1 SanDisk part as the HTC 10, because its storage benchmark scores are basically a mirror image of that phone's. Slower than the UFS storage of the LG G5 and Galaxy S7, certainly, but still quite quick in most regards. This is certainly good news, as the Idol 3's storage was abysmally slow.. Wireless performance has been strong for the most part - LTE signal on AT&T seems in line with what I'd expect in my area, and Wi-Fi performance and reception seems pretty good, too. Where I've had at least one issue? Bluetooth: I cannot get the Idol 4S to pair with my car's stereo. This may be a preproduction firmware bug, though. Call quality is good, and unlike the Idol 3, the earpiece speaker on this phone seems much better tuned for phone calls (the Idol 3's was quite muddy). And like the previous phone, you can orient the Idol 4S in either direction on a voice call using the "reversible" mode if you so desire.. Alcatel easily out-Boomsounds HTC's latest flagship with its dual 3.6W speakers on the Idol 4S. Not only are they very powerful, they actually sound pretty great. You get real mid-range with these speakers! Peak output isn't hugely louder than, say, a Galaxy S7, but the difference comes through in the fullness and depth of the audio. Greater dynamic range makes audio more clear and perceptible, and hopefully means you won't have to crank it as loud to hear what you're listening to. Now, it's no replacement for a Moto Z's ginormous JBL Mod, but this is easily among the very best speaker arrays I've ever listened to on a smartphone. They're also true stereo speakers, and the channel separation can be further exaggerated using the Maxx Audio effects in the audio settings.. Alcatel designed the Idol 4S with speaker ports on both the front and rear of the phone, too, so some audio comes through when the phone is face down. This does mean that some sound escapes through the back at all times, though I can tell you that audio listened to from the rear is considerably quieter, so this isn't a 50/50 split. More accurately, I think, Alcatel has simply attempted to avoid the total "muffle" effect if the phone is placed face down by allowing some audio to escape the rear if the front is blocked. The vast majority of audio comes through the front ports even when the rear is totally unobstructed. What I'm trying to say is: the rear ports don't make the front-facing speakers appreciably worse.. The headphone jack produces respectable audio, generally in line with what I'd expect of a modern smartphone, which is to say "very good to excellent." Surprisingly, the included JBL-branded earbuds aren't half-bad, though they are insanely bass-heavy. Aggressive equalization can address this, though the built-in Maxx Audio system-level tools don't really offer the stuff to get the job done. That all said, these are shockingly usable earbuds (comfortable, to boot) for an in-box bundle - a far cry from the frankly terrible ones Samsung includes with its $800 S7 edge.. The Idol 4S's camera has left me a bit disappointed and confused. Sometimes, it gets some really great shots, showing me that the sensor is a good part and that Alcatel's processing can be quite capable. Sometimes I kind of want to throw it. Blurring in low light is a constant issue with this phone, the auto-focus is finicky on close-up shots, the HDR mode is utterly confounding in the results it produces, and video is quite shaky.. This is a capable camera, I have no doubt. I'm not sure what Alcatel's definition of HDR really is, but holy cow, the amount of halo effect going on in some of these images is totally ridiculous. It makes the world look like some kind of drug-addled fairy tale. So: kind of cool, but also clearly unrealistic. The HDR mode must also be manually engaged, which always feels like a step back from the auto-HDR modes on many modern phones. But it's the results that really don't work for me here, not the button.. The halo effects around objects and the ridiculous color saturation make this photo look like it was hacked apart and back together in Photoshop.. Similarly, in low light, Alcatel is still using the ancient method of a manual "night mode" button to ensure decent captures. I found photos with and without the mode engaged were... So why include it? It doesn't seem to particularly matter anyway, as this camera isn't much of a winner in low light conditions, and especially struggles with artificial light indoors. Take a look at this photo I took in my kitchen - all lights in my apartment on around 7PM.. This was the best of several shots, and it's still utterly gross - look at those noisy, blotchy reds on the cups.. Sometimes the results are good, which leads me to believe this is a capable camera, it's just that Alcatel's processing and tuning is substandard in certain conditions.. Moving on to the app experience, Alcatel's is decent, but the "swipe to change modes" thing is fairly annoying to use. It's often slow to respond, and because my instinct is generally to tap the text for the mode, not swipe, I often end up accidentally hitting the capture or gallery key instead of the mode I want.. There is a manual mode which gives you access to ISO, shutter speed, white balance, and focus. But smartphone manual mode aficionados - something I still don't quite get - will lament that the maximum exposure length is half a second. Oh, and the viewfinder doesn't update the preview based on your manual settings (yes, really), essentially making it completely useless. It's possible this is a bug, however.. In general, the Idol 4S takes pretty good photos in the right conditions, but lackluster low and artificial light performance, rather odd HDR, and a fairly "meh" camera app don't really leave me with a memorable experience here. It's totally serviceable, but it's just not a great experience. The Idol 4S's Snapdragon 652 chipset is perfectly respectable, offering performance that greatly exceeds the laggardly Snapdragon 61x series that have plagued so many budget and mid-range devices in the last year. Most notably, the 652's GPU is more than up to the task of pushing the phone's dense Quad HD display panel. If you're getting a mid-range Qualcomm chip, this is the one you want.. Even with its quick internal storage, the Idol 4S does struggle a bit more than a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge or even a Nexus 6P in some regards, and sometimes in ways that just feel a bit odd - perhaps down to less than fantastic software optimization, or a throttle-heavy CPU profile designed to save power. So while this phone is quick , it's not lightning-fast. Given its price point, is that enough?. Well, the Snapdragon 820s in the similarly-priced OnePlus 3 and ZTE Axon 7 will rather easily best this Snapdragon 652 on single-thread performance, and while the 652 is theoretically quicker than the outgoing 810 in raw CPU terms, even that chip's GPU is notably more robust than the mid-tier Adreno 510. Both the 810 and 820 also support LPDDR4 RAM, while the 652 is stuck on the slower LPDDR3 standard. Last, the 652 is based on a 28nm fabrication process, with the 810 and 820 based on 20 and 14nm nodes, respectively, meaning they likely exhibit greater efficiency at comparable performance levels. The 652's advanced and efficient ARM Cortex A72 cores likely make up for some of this natural disadvantage, but I think the result is a chip that still feels marginally slower than its 810 and 820 series relatives in most contexts, and considerably slower in some.. That all said: the Idol 4S is not a slow phone. It's just that it's a slower phone than some others available at this price point, a la the Nexus 6P (now regularly seeing $100 discounts), OnePlus 3, and ZTE Axon 7. With open-box Galaxy S7s regularly treading near the Idol 4S's MSRP on eBay these days , it's hard to say Alcatel's latest phone offers a lot of technology for the money.. When you saw the Idol 4S's VR-in-a-box, you probably thought two things:. To the first: yes, it is a pretty cool concept. To the second, I was hesitant to pass judgment until I really gave it a try. Sadly, that initial suspicion seems utterly validated, Alcatel's VR experience just isn't good. I really don't even understand how this passed muster in testing against competing products.. There is no doubt: this is a freaking cool retail box design.. The setup experience is confusing, for one. So, the VR headset has no physical connector for the phone, meaning it must use NFC or something similar to detect the headset. This sounds fine, until it doesn't work. I put the phone in the headset and... I took it out and put it back in, except reversed. Tried it again in the original position. So finally I just went into the app drawer and started the VR launcher app - that worked. From then on, the auto-detection did seem to function most of the time I would put the phone in the headset, so maybe this is a bug that will get sorted out in a day-one OTA. I'm willing to look past this as some pre-launch glitchiness. Gear VR's setup process, by comparison, is pretty much idiot-proof even if it does require you to download an app and remove the phone from the headset initially.. Getting the phone in the headset is easy. Getting it to work is a little less so, I found.. My first impression on actually putting on the headset? "Wow, this is uncomfortable." While my glasses do fit in the headset, the edge of the nose bridge cutout touches my nose at all times and at any angle. And that edge is sharp. Without the phone in the headset, it's not too bad, but once the phone is putting weight at the front of the assembly, it's extremely annoying. And I will admit: I do have a big nose. But not like, a gigantic nose. I'm not getting rhinoplasty spam mail. So, this was clearly designed by people who did not have large noses. It makes Alcatel VR all but a complete ergonomic non-starter for me, but I soldiered on to try and at least see if the experience itself redeemed this design flaw.. Sharp edges around the nose area make Alcatel's headset an ergonomic miss for me.. First off, Alcatel's VR field of view is gen-one Google Cardboard status. They say it's 90 degrees, but I have trouble even believing that. It's not VR so much as a glorified View-Master experience - it's like you're looking through a particularly wide ship's porthole. Sure, there's a VR launcher, Alcatel preloads some VR games, 360 videos, and photos, but this has all the magic and wonder of a second-rate Disneyland in Soviet Russia circa 1971 that'd translate loosely into MouseVillage or something. The motion tracking is inconsistent and constantly needs to be reoriented (in one video it completely freaked out on me and made super dizzy in the process). It's so bad that I thought it was possible I had a defective gyroscope.... until I asked someone else testing the phone, and they reported similar jank. The images are sharp (which is good, since there is no focus adjustment knob, unlike Gear VR), but the narrow field of view makes immersion kind of hopeless.. Alcatel's VR content could be counted on three or four hands at the moment, and most of it is old.. This might be novel to someone who has literally never used VR before, but a generation two Google Cardboard provides a much wider field of view (~100 degrees) and arguably even superior comfort in my case. The Cardboard app is also leagues better than Alcatel's VR launcher or "Littlestar" content hub, which I still don't quite understand. Thankfully, the Cardboard app is totally compatible with the Alcatel viewer, so you can use that instead. why not just buy a proper Cardboard viewer? Or, better yet, just wait for Daydream viewers to come out, since those will likely provide the best VR experience on Android to date.. Seriously why are the buttons on the bottom of the headset. And as if to put some bizarre icing on the cake, Alcatel has also placed the buttons (home and back) for the VR headset on... Why? WHO OKAYED THIS? Oh, and I've found that if you hit back and home at random enough, you'll just get thrown back to your phone's homescreen, completely breaking immersion and the experience. Anyway, Alcatel's real competitor here is Gear VR. So, how does this stack up?. The only redeeming thing about Alcatel's VR is that it works with Cardboard as a native Cardboard viewer would. But a modern Cardboard offers dramatically better field of view, and with Daydream headsets that work with any Daydream-compatible device coming out some time this year, there's really no reason to buy a headset that works with only one phone.. As to Gear VR? Samsung has a huge content lead in terms of games and experiences right now, and I doubt Alcatel has any hope of catching up - it'll likely get some titles from developers looking to branch out beyond Cardboard and the Oculus Store, but that's really it. There's no reason to develop specifically for Alcatel's VR experience. It will have tiny penetration compared to Gear VR, let alone Cardboard, and Daydream basically makes the hardware irrelevant.. Why am I spending so much time on this section of the review, you rightly ask? Because Alcatel has hinged so much of the Idol 4S - and justifying its MSRP - on this whole VR business. But their VR offering just isn't good, not in its current state. So, my advice to prospective buyers: don't even consider this in the phone's "value" proposition, because as is, Alcatel's VR is little more than a fancy retail box. Or a mediocre Cardboard viewer with a headstrap, if you're an optimist.. Alcatel left Android largely unmolested in last year's Idol 3, and the same is essentially true of the Idol 4S. Sure, you've got a few-hundred megabytes of apps you can't uninstall that I'd really prefer I could, but none of these apps are paid preloads, they're just stuff Alcatel thinks adds to the experience. And for some people, they may well! For me? No thanks.. Once you throw on a custom launcher and, if that's your thing, an icon pack, you'll probably feel at Marshmallow-y home on this phone. Alcatel's settings menu is somewhat modified, but most of those modifications are just additional options and features. For example, managing the dual SIM trays, configuring the custom function key, and various gestures.. A number you'll probably be seeing a while, though Alcatel promises a Nougat upgrade at some point.. I said I'd discuss Alcatel's key-that-shall-not-be-named, so let's go into that. In its default setup, the custom function button does the following:. Some of the key's functions are a bit strange.. You can also customize the button to do one of the following, though that disables the above app effects (the sub-bullets).. Is this going to revolutionize the way you use your smartphone? Even be something you're likely to use regularly outside a camera quick-launch key? Let's be real: probably not. But Alcatel did put in some effort here, and none of this stuff really hurts anything, so it might appeal to somebody. It's nice sometimes to have a function key, I think we can all agree.. The 4S also supports gestures like double-tap to wake, "drawing" gestures (think OnePlus) to launch any app you desire, flip to mute, some sort of "hover" gesture a la Samsung's Air View (but much more limited), and a glove mode toggle.. Aside from that? It really is just kind of regular Android. Which is what I liked about the Idol 3. The questions come in regard to what "regular Android" looks like six months from now: will it be Marshmallow or Nougat? The Idol 3 took ages to be upgraded from Android 5.0 to 6.0 (5.1 was never released for it) - well over six months. If the Idol 4S takes as long to get Nougat, this phone really is only recommendable to those who don't feel much concern over their phone's current OS version. As to security updates, only time will tell if Alcatel plans to take them seriously (i.e., monthly).. So, Alcatel's software is inoffensive, fairly close to a "Google" Android, and not loaded down with excessive bloat. In this area, the Idol 4S does quite well, it's just a matter of those pesky updates.. In short, there is nothing so terribly wrong with the Idol 4S. It has a great screen, solid performance, relatively bloat-free software with few unnecessary alterations, an OK camera, a robust set of speakers, and most of the major features you look for in a modern smartphone. The problem is that the game has changed: Alcatel's competition at this price point for unlocked smartphone buyers in the US is unquestionably fierce. And when placed against that competition, it's clear that the Idol 4S is an inferior value in most respects.. It's slower, its camera isn't as good, its battery life is no better, its "quality" and design are nothing to get excited over, and it comes with OS update baggage that'd make Samsung blush. It's not that the Idol 4S is a bad phone, it's that other phones are better. And areas where the Idol 4S stumbles - a camera that sucks in low light, a bad fingerprint scanner, an exceptionally slippery design, and a lame VR experience meant to justify a price - are simply not acceptable in 2016. Not when other companies are offering better experiences for the same money.. So, Alcatel, here's the rub: your phone is too expensive. Knock the price back to $300, and we'll talk. Not $350, not $329.99 - $300. When I can get a Nexus 5X that stomps this phone in most respects for less money - with the guarantee of proper OS update support - I'm not really interested, as an enthusiast. But for a casual consumer, $300 seems like an MSRP that fits the bill for the package this phone offers. Heck, ditch the gimmicky VR, unbundle the surprisingly decent headphones, get rid of the unnecessary glass cover panel and replace it with plastic and call it the 4S Lite or something. Until then, this phone's MSRP exists in a reality more virtual than that headset's..

Guess the folks who set price for this all got subsidized phones, so they lost touch on how much the average Joe is willing to pay :). You think the nexus 5X is better than this, it's all subjective and I love my Nexus devices (since Samsung Nexus), I rather buy this than 5X, but I completely agree with you on the price. This should be around $329.99 not $399.99. You'd have the same opinion when the Nexus 5X gets Android 7.0 a month from now and this will get it months and months after that? I kind of doubt that.. This is true...god knows when this phone will ever receive an Android update, or even monthly.... Protip: If it's not a major OEM, chances are its flagships won't get updates.. Of course, there will always be outliers, but.... looks too much of sammy phone. "maybe this is a bug that will get sorted out in a day-one OTA". The Idol 3 went weeks (if not months, I don't remember the exact timeframe) with almost entirely non-functional double-tap-to-wake.. looks like a burner phone I use. costs more than i like to spend since i only make so much giving blowies for a living.. I can't wait for my phone to be able to sleepwalk.. It's funny how other websites give good reviews on this phone whereas you guys are pure haters. Not everything in this world is "crapple or cheapsung". Besides your review of 30 paragraphs is as boring as my grandma's books.. Something tells me you didn't actually read the whole review. It isn't entirely negative, they're just mainly pointing out that it's a bit of a letdown compared to the value of the Idol 3.. You mean like the Craplcatel Idol 4S?. What did you expect? Move on...... the entire review is about how the phone is very good, it's just overpriced. its okay, for people like me who may be interested in android coming from iphone, this phone actually looks like a good deal compared to other phones similarly priced, including iphone and samsung.. There have been a few good reviews. Most echo a similar theme though...mediocre at this price. They waited too long to release it.. Well, you see, you say that. I was considering buying this phone to replace my slowly aging Xperia Z3. And yet, this review made me delay the phone switch. Yes, I read and watched multiple reviews of the Idol 4S, but after reading everything on here, I'm leaning more towards the OnePlus 3.. If it's a flaw, it should be said. If something does not work as well as in the competition's devices, it should be mentioned.. If something isn't as good as on other phones, I, a potential buyer, deserve to know that. And a good reviewer is obligated to expose EVERYTHING about the phone, good or bad.. isnt this the phone that BB snagged?. No, that's the smaller, cheaper Idol 4, which is not announced for the US.. The idol 4 will be on cricket wireless. You're really not doing anyone any favors when you refer to 2560x1440 resolution as "2K". It's not part of that standard and gives the impression of a much lower resolution device. Why not just write the actual resolution out, or stick with "QHD" like you used elsewhere?. It's used interchangeably in marketing and tech news, people know what it means. I get your point, but 2K=QHD colloquially. No one is going to be confused by that at this point.. Using the wrong terms interchangeably instead of sticking to the correct ones further spreads their adoption. This is how you end up with 'figuratively' becoming one of the dictionary definitions for 'literally'.. It's a common mistake that is used in marketing, it is not the technical term but it is the industry standard (even if it is wrong).. "I don't mean to be a jerk" <-------- David Ruddock.. Yes, actually you do, with every review or comment you make. Someone at AP needs to teach you how to talk to people. Thank god someone else is doing the ZTE Axon 7 review.. I can't tell if you're being sarcastic. No, I don't: I mean to be clear that every smartphone review I write with a screen-on time figure gets someone jumping in saying "that's terrible/amazing/awful/unbelievable." I'm not invalidating anyone's opinion, I'm just saying the results are not comparable.. There are plenty of sites that like to sugar coat their "reviews". Perhaps you're better off reading them.. The images from the phone look pretty ordinary. Compared to the price, there sure are many options than this one.. I wanted this phone back in Feb. They waited way too long to release it. The Axon 7 / OP3 appears to be where it's at this year.. Consumers be like 'oooh aluminium, and glass back like iPhone, and 2x cheaper than S7 Edge, and even camera button like Sony has'. A year ago a particular HTC phone was selling mostly thanks to it's looks, why Alcatel cannot play the same card? It ticks most of the boxes, and doesn't look half-bad.. " It's hard not to associate "premium" and "quality" with these materials, because they're what we've been told are "premium quality" materials.". I've long maintained that referring to fragile and slippery glass backs as "premium" is nothing but marketing B.S. Good to see AP move away from this.. When Samsung and Apple put glass or, aluminium they´re "premium", when alcatel did it well.... Fair, but I'm assuming you're not talking about AP. While David omitted to mention how slippery the S7 is until the comments, his review of the S7 & S7 Edge contains no mention of the word "Premium".. I don't know if I've read any review David does that isn't very negative. Guy seems like he just hates everything and anything and is super bitter. (not saying this phone deserves praise, just seems like a recurring theme in his articles/reviews). I think David is what a phone reviewer should be: Unforgiving. If there's a flaw, even a minor one, he exposes it and gives his thoughts on it. He gives praise where praise is due, like he says in the beginning how he liked the Idol 3, but that praise should not overshadow the flaws.. No phone is perfect, and even things like the HTC 10 and SGS7 are akin to a Lamborghini without one wheel. I mean sure, it's a Lambo, it's a great car, it's just missing a fucken wheel.. And to be fair, the reviewer never said the Idol 4S was a bad phone; simply overpriced for what it offers.. I think David is what a phone reviewer should be: Unforgiving.

The boom button is a direct copy of sony's power button. Also why didn't you compare the speakers to the Sony Xperia z5. Since that is the only phone that offers good stereo speakers and good audio software. What the hell happened there? Why would you compare it to a galaxy phone which is only a single speaker or the HTC 10 which is only a single channel and not true stereo sound. Your assumption that I have everyphoneever.jpg is misplaced. The Z5 also is getting pretty old.. I didn't assume you had every phone ever. I said why didn't you compare the speakers to the z5? Yet you compared them to the s7 and HTC 10 which isn't a good comparison.. Because he doesn't have a z5 but he has S7 and HTC10, lol. Is it that hard for you to understand. Obviously you don't know how to read or comprehend. If he doesn't own every phone in the world then how does he have a galaxy and an HTC. Also a dual speaker phone cannot be compared to a single speaker phone. What don't you get about that?. Obviously you don't know how tech sites work. ABC phone company wants XYZ site to review MNO phone, so they send MNO phone to XYZ site under a contract that: a) they produce a review, b) they only publish the review after XX day XX month, c) they send it back to ABC company after XX days. XYZ site follows the contract, reviews, and sends it back. XYZ's employee who reveiws MNO phone may buy his own personal unit after the review, but usually does not keep review units.. XYZ site may not get phones from DEF company if DEF's latest phone is not available in the USA, or if DEF just doesn't think XYZ site is big or trustworthy enough. In this case DEF company is Sony: it hasn't sent David a review unit, it's a phone only available unlocked in the US 4 months after its release lacking a fingerprint scanner, and known to only few people. It's also getting pretty old: so forgive him for forgetting.. Aw shucks, my dad needs a new phone but I wasn't going to get one last year, with the disaster that was Snapdragon. Is there a smaller 4.7" model available this time as well (maybe with a lower price tag, without some unnecessary features, like the fingerprint reader and the glass back)?. The smaller Idol 4 is 5.2" this year. It's also using the SD617 from last year, so it doesn't really avoid that issue. It's also only available through Cricket Wireless in the US.. The $300 BlackBerry DTEK 50 is a rebranded 5.2" Idol 4, sans fingerprint scanner and with a rubberised plastic back instead of glass, but it's still the 617..

Mediocre battery life: I don't want to say the Idol 4S's battery life is poor, but it's not great. So which one? mediocre or average?. or poor or not great? and compared to which one?. If you compare it, it should be aganist a smarpthone with same mAh. Mediocre by definition is horribly average. It means it fails to stick out. I agree that the phone is overpriced. Everyone jumps my bones when I say it should be $300 max. If it wasn't $400 then I would've bought it regardless of the lack of color options.. Funny thing is that I actually do care about oled burn in and hate Seeing it. Why are you so whiny and negative? Its not at all pleasant to read. I am not saying you should sugar coat everything or hide its faults but just be straightforward, adding a little of bit of character to the language is good but not downright negative like this so that it becomes too uneasy to read. From the language of the review i was surprised to find out that you were actually a man, i thought a woman on her PMS wrote this. And no other review has left me utterly confused at the end more than this, is it good, is it bad or is it in between? i have absolutely no idea, hence you have failed in your job which is to give a proper review of the phone which helps the consumer to make a decision.. It's aluminium in British English, aluminum in American English.. None of the words is wrong, they're both correct.. Excellent post.I am from a new company"Nandbox".It has brought a new app"mobile application privacy"nandbox is a Free Chat Messenger for Android and iPhone to share photo, video, audio & voice notes with friends and family. I don't think there was a mention in this article about how much RAM this phone has.... Alcatel lost me with how they handled OS updates with the idol 3. I gave them a go and they disappointed, fwiw I didn't expect much and they didn't disappoint. I paid $180 for my idol 3 over a year ago and it was an awesome value imo, with that said, I wouldn't pay more than $200-250 for any alcatel phone.. I tend to avoid this particular witers reviews because I know they will always be negative, this is another example. Most other reviews for this phone are overwhelmingly positive. It seems like he only compared the SD652 to the SD820 and decided ahead of time this phone was going to be bad. The 652 isn't as powerful as the 820 but it is more than powerful enough for most people.. Reviewers like this one are one of the reasons I often avoid this site and go to the other android sites.. The is indeed very precisely written. I have never seen any review on any other site being as descriptive as the one here. I don't know why people are considering it to be a wholly negative one as David clearly emphasized on every bits and pieces of what the phone had to offer. Which is not bad and that IS what makes this a good review. I came here to have some knowledge and comparison about the speakers in this device. Which I found to be quite amazing and adequate enough to brag about among others.. Thank you David Ruddock for your insights.. So I realize that this review is a year old, but this is completely inaccurate, or the Windows version is just that much better. I have the IDOL 4S with Windows 10, and few of the specs, if any actually, you have in your review are accurate. I read this review out of curiosity, to see if there were any things that maybe I had missed or had not come up yet that I needed to be looking for. And I found the entire thing.. My fingerprint scanner works just fine, like half a second and my phone scans my print AND unlocks. If you want it to be any faster than that you are MAKING problems. My processor is absolutely the Snapdragon 820. The Snapdragon 820 MSM8996 Quad-Core, to be exact. Basically all of the things you have said were either from the IDOL 4, not the 4S, or Android got the 4S Lite. Because my phone is the best I have ever owned. But again, I am like a year late to this party, so who knows, maybe they read your review and thought "Shit, we better up our game." and basically rebuilt the entire phone. Upgraded the hardware and the software, changed the port, dropped the price. I am sure it is not the best phone out there, but a hell of a lot better than the phone in your review. That you insist is the same one. I am not saying this is a bad review, I am just saying that whatever phone you reviewed here was absolutely not the same phone I have. EDIT: Yes, I realize this is an Android website, but a phone should be a phone, despite OS..
