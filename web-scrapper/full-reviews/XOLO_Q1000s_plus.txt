Smart phone manufacturers are plenty and the entry-level smart phone wars are on an all time high. Various Smart phone manufacturers (Global and Local) have come out with entry-level Android Kit Kat based smart phones and needless to say, the consumers are definitely spoilt for choice. One such vendor that has been involved in making much entry level and mid budget smart phones with quite reasonable price tags is Xolo. Off late, the vendor is completely set to launch two smart phones, the Q700s Plus and Q1000 s Plus. This device is priced at Rs. 13,999*/- and has some of the most eye popping features that would definitely make you consider buying it.. Let’s delve into the Q1000s Plus device and look at its specs and features and understand what makes this device unique:. The Q1000s Plus is controlled by a Mediatek 6589t 1.5 Ghz cortex A7 quad core processor with an Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) Operating System mated to 2GB RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. The device performs quite well considering its price, although, it would have been better to see a new processor as many competitors are offering similar octa cores at similar prices. Even though they may not offer a huge upgrade in terms of performance, but they still provide a decent upgrade. The device runs on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and will be upgraded to Android 4.4 KitKat but misses out on the HIVE UI of Xolo. The Xolo Q1000s Plus also has an Accelerometer sensor along with Proximity sensor and misses out the compass / magnetometer, Ambient light Sensor, Gyro Scope, Barometer, Temperature Sensor. The phone supports Java, but just like the Q 700 S Plus, even the browser of the Q1000s Plus doesn’t support flash. As far as messaging goes, the device has SMS (threaded view), MMS, Email, Push Email, IM; it has a HTML 5 browser as well as Java MIDP emulator. It also has SNS integration, organizer, Document viewer, Google Search, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Calendar, Google Talk, Voice memo etc.. The Xolo Q1000s Plus has a 5-inch Full HD, IPS OGS screen with a resolution of 1920 X 1080 pixels resulting in a pixel density f 441 ppi density. It is based on One Glass Solution Technology and offers a support for 5 touch points. The display is an IPS unit provides users with good viewing angles and decent visibility under direct sunlight. It is really astounding to know that Xolo Q1000s Plus sports up such a brilliant display that most likely makes competing phones rethink their display moves. The phone measures at 147 x 72.19 x 7.98 mm and feels light yet elegant and is available in white and black colors.. The phone connects you to many possibilities and it is a winner in this department. The phone has Wi-Fi connectivity (802.11 b / g / n) along with GPS, Bluetooth (v 4.0) but just like most phones in its category, the device doesn’t have NFC, Infrared, DLNA, MHL, HDMI port. The phone has a 3.5 mm audio jack with a micro USB port that allows charging. The phone doesn’t have a proprietary data connector or a charging connector. What’s good is that this device has a Dual SIM slot, one slot supports 3G and the other slot supports 2G. The 3G (HSDPA) connectivity speeds up to 42.2 Mbps and HSUPA speeds up to 11.5 Mbps , the 2G network supports GSM 900 / 1800 bands.. The battery unit found under the Xolo Q1000s Plus’ hood is a powerful 3000 mAh unit that provides a talk time of up to 27 hours on 2G networks and 15.2 hours on 2G networks, the device lasts for almost 70 hours on wired handsets with music playback and around 47 hours through speakers. The battery is pretty good for its price and the features. It somehow epitomizes the performance to price ratio quite well.. Dual cameras have become a necessity and Xolo does its best to bring the best features in the box. The device has an excellent 13 megapixel primary camera with 4128 x 3096 pixels and it has LED flash as well as Autofocus. The camera also has features such as Geo-Tagging, Touch Focus, Face Detection, Panorama, HDR, and Image Stabilization. The device has another beautifully placed 5-megapixel front facing camera. The Video quality on this device looks quite sharp and pristine with 1080p@30fps. Entertainment comes packed in this device, the phone has MP3 / WAV / WMA / AAC player as well as MP4 / WMV / H.264 / H.263 player, and to top it all, the device has an FM Radio too.. The Q1000s Plus smart phone is priced at Rs. It feels like a real companion in your hands. Xolo is making its best efforts to make smart phone users experience a lot more than just using a handset. This phone is thrilling and definitely worth spending on.. Lenovo Vibe X Karbonn Titanium X Alcatel One Touch Idol X Plus HTC Desire 816 Samsung Galaxy S4 Sony Xperia Z Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo.

Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime Review: The goods and the bads. Xolo Q1000S Plus Quick Review, Price and Comparison. Home Reviews. Xolo has just launched the Q1000S Plus smartphone in India at a price of Rs 13,999 in order to garner a share of the sub Rs 15,000 segment in the country. The device runs on Android 4.4 KitKat and has its battery has one of its strongest arenas to help differentiate it from the rest. In this time and age when smartphones come with really less battery backups, it surely helps to have a bigger battery in your smartphone. Let us take a quick review of its specifications:. The camera unit at the back of the Xolo Q1000S Plus is a 13MP camera with a LED flash and s BSI 2 sensor for better low light imaging. It is complemented well by a 5MP camera up front that would be taking charge of the video calling will be a 5MP camera. So the smartphone is pretty well equipped in terms of imaging.. The internal storage of the device stands at 32GB but it cannot be expanded via a microSD card slot. Many may say that there’s no external storage but on the face of it, 32GB of internal storage is just fine for an average consumer.. The processor under the hood of the Xolo Q1000S is a MT6589T 1.5 GHz quad core processor coupled with a 2GB RAM. The processor made sense 6-8 months ago but now it just seems outdated. Yes it performs well but at this price point, we would have liked a better processor as we have started getting octa cores at this price. Even though they may not offer a huge upgrade in terms of performance, but they still provide a decent upgrade.. The battery unit under the hood is a decently powerful 3,000 mAh unit. It has been rated to provide a talk time of up to 27 hours on 2G networks and 15.2 hours on 2G networks. As far as your music playback needs are concerned, it will last almost 71 hours on wired handsets and 48 hours through the speakers.. The display unit on the Xolo Q1000S Plus is a 5 inch one which has a resolution of 1920 X 1080 pixels resulting in a pixel density f 441 ppi. It is based on One Glass Solution Technology and offers a support for 5 touch points. The display is an IPS unit so has good viewing angles and comes with a decent sunlight legibility too. So we have no complaints in this regard.. The device runs on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and will be upgraded to Android 4.4 KitKat but misses out on the HIVE UI of Xolo. But we would have liked the latest iteration of Android to be present on it out of the box.. It will be going up against the likes of Micromax Canvas Knight Cameo , iBall Andi 5K Panther , Xolo 8X-1000 and Karbonn Titanium Octane .. The price of Rs 13,999 seems justified to an extent seeing the fact that it has a full HD display, a good battery and a decently performing camera too. But it runs on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and features an outdated processor. With Xiaomi and OnePlus One entering India, things might get a bit difficult for the Xolo offering in future..

Music and video playback time is more than 48hrs and 7hrs respectively. The phone as RAM of 2GB and the largest internal storage of 32GB but it is not extendible. The memory is large enough to support major Android apps.. Best performing and long lasting battery life. Android is of older version, need to be upgraded. The processor is bit outdated and observe performance lags. The price set for Xolo Q1000S plus is quite justifiable for the benefits the smartphone brings along. It has full HD display with big screen, a wonderfully performing battery and a quite decently working camera.
