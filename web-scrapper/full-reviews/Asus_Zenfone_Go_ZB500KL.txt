Last edited by Noobzone01 on 2016/12/9 00:25. i just bought an asus zenfone GO, model ZB500KL in Portugal. Priced at 149,99€ I found this phone to be a very good price when looking at the specs:. CPU: Qualcom Snapdragon 410 quad-core @ 1.0 ghz. Camera: 13MP LED Flash / 5MP. Dual Sim: 2G/3G/4G (dual stand-by, only one can use 3G/4G). Untill now, after 3 days of use, i have no complains or regrets about this phone. I do, however, notice a lack of user input or feedback. This phone is not even included in GSM-Arena. Being this an asus zenfone product, i wonder why there is no subforum for bug reporting or user input, as this should be a very good mid tear Android phone. If anyone finds this in a google search: battery lasts somewhat of a day, no problems untill now, camera is not perfect but acceptable. If anything, i would like to see a subforum, even for update information and bug reporting, algo some asus apps are not updating saying "phone is not compatible" in google play store. Edit: This phone is now in gsm-arena: http://www.gsmarena.com/asus_zenfone_go_zb500kl-8467.php#. Same here i also buy this in Malaysia. But i cant find of much info reg phone. And also not in asus list for bug reporting. i hope asus can include subforum for this model....

I have an ASUS_00AD and it won't detect my flash drive, not even a notification, not in the phone storage page....Nothing. The flash drive works fine with my other devices so that is not the problem. Also, when I connect the phone to my laptop, the phone is not detected. Although the phone gives a message that USB is working, nothing transmits to my laptop.

With a recommended price of almost 179 Euros ($190), Asus' ZenFone is an entry-level device with mid-range ambitions. Thus, it is slightly more expensive than last year's ZenFone Go, but now it has a better camera and bigger battery in return. High-end features should not be expected this year either. However, at least it comes with an HD panel, removable battery, dual SIM function, and LTE. Asus advertises its ergonomic design and various casing colors of which only black, silver, and white are currently offered in Germany.. All devices are in a price range of 150 to 200 Euros (~$159 to ~$212).. Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 MSM8916 Qualcomm Adreno 306. Test device courtesy of Asus Deutschland.

Asus' ZenFone is made entirely of plastic. A stripe with the typical design of Asus' Zen products is inserted below the menu keys: Metal looks with polished, concentric rings. The surfaces are monochrome and otherwise simple. The back is rounded toward the outer sides, which makes it comfortable to hold the ZenFone Go in the hand. The design is also rather organic and roundish rather than angular and thus the handset is pleasant to the touch. Fortunately, the back cover can be removed and the battery can be exchanged. However, both the back cover and battery are relatively difficult to remove. We even had to use a screwdriver to pry out the battery. Asus offers covers in different colors. However, they cannot be purchased individually and are only in a set of colors. Blue and red are currently not available in Central Europe. Silver with brushed aluminum looks, black and white are currently the three color versions on this market.. The clearly curved back makes the ZenFone Go significantly thicker than other smartphones from this category. However, its weight of 135 grams (~4.8 oz) also makes it very light. We quite liked the casing's stability. Pressure on the back or the screen left the smartphone just as unimpressed as our twisting attempts. The smartphone makes a very high-quality impression here. Only the back cover sometimes produced a cracking noise under pressure.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. 2 GB of working memory and 16 GB of storage are a typical configuration for this category. Huawei's P8 Lite (2017) , come with one GB of working memory extra. A fingerprint scanner is now not unusual in this price range, but Asus' ZenFone Go does not feature this. An FM radio and USB OTG are part of the configuration though.. Upper edge: Standby button, 3.5-mm audio jack. Asus calls its proprietary user interface ZenUI. It is based on Android, and only a few and mainly visual modifications have been made to Google's Android 6.0 operating system at first glance. It was pleasing that a software update was available right after starting our tests. Thus, Asus apparently takes care of its low-cost smartphones. The Android security patches dated 1st March 2017 after the update and are thus quite up-to-date: Very good, Asus.. Asus has preloaded quite a few software on its handset. Fortunately, there is no adware apart from a hotel-rating platform app. The apps allow accessing Asus' Service Center and the Zen Community or cleaning up the smartphone..

It is quite normal that only the Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n standard is supported in this price range. However, it is unfortunately not normal that a smartphone should also utilize the speed reserves, which the ZenFone Go does. The review sample achieved almost twice the transmission speed as most comparison devices in our standardized Wi-Fi test a meter (~3 ft) away from the router. LTE is now also a matter of course, but this was included for only specific countries in the predecessor. Thus, the current ZenFone Go is significantly more up-to-date. The review sample is also on par with the comparison devices with its bandwidth of 150 MBit per second (download) and 50 MBit per second (upload). However, it offers a relatively large selection with seven LTE bands, and thus it is quite possible that a fast mobile network will be found even in somewhat more exotic countries. The indoor LTE reception was good in the well-developed Vodafone network in an urban area..

The GPS module of the ZenFone Go could not locate us indoors. The reception improves when moving towards a window, and the maximum accuracy of 7 meters (~23 ft) outdoors is acceptable.. In the practical test where we take the review sample and Garmin's Edge 500 on a bike ride, the ZenFone Go unfortunately lost the signal to the satellite at 4.8 kilometers (~3 mi) of the route, and did not reconnect. The professional navigation system logged the entire route correctly. This is too bad as the review sample did quite a good job on the route through the woods. Overall, the module seems to be quite susceptible to interference and thus, the user should think twice about relying on the ZenFone Go as a navigation system..

Asus has modified the phone app. The keypad opens first and the user can access contacts and frequently called numbers via the tabs in the screen's upper area. Thus, overall, the app is quite similar to that of Google's standard app and its handling is also similarly comfortable.. Unfortunately, the contactâs voice sounds very thin since the earpiece does not transmit the low tones. The maximum volume is good and its sound is also quite clear. Our voices also sound somewhat thin and bass-less to our contact, but transmission is also relatively clear and quite audible when we speak more quietly. The contact sounds similar as via the earpiece when using the hands-free mode. However, we had to speak louder in order for the contact to hear us.. Asus' ZenFone Go is also on category average in terms of cameras: 13 megapixels in the back and 5 megapixels in the front are designed to capture decent photos. The image quality of the primary camera is, in fact, good. Its sharpness is appropriate, the subjective color reproduction is good, but the photos look much darker and subdued than those of. The quality also decreases rapidly in poor light conditions. Objects are outlined visibly and colored areas are noisy. Consequently, Asus' ZenFone Go is more suitable for sunshine photographers.. Videos can be recorded in the Full HD resolution. The illumination adapts well to new situations, but it is a little too slow for our taste. Furthermore, the focus sometimes has to be readjusted manually.. The 5-megapixel front camera shoots decent selfies, and still displays details well even in dark places. However, it has problems with bright surroundings as objects are then quickly illuminated too strongly. The subjective sharpness is acceptable, but the photos should not be scaled up too much, otherwise distortions will soon become evident.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. The primary camera of Asus' ZenFone Go ZB500KL also has to show its capabilities in the lab. We analyze the color reproduction and sharpness under defined light conditions. Some colors are reproduced too brightly and also display a visible noise. The general image sharpness and the sharpness of texts on colored backgrounds are moderate. Apparently, Asus' ZenFone Go only creates really sharp photos in really ideal conditions. The sharpness decreases even more toward the photo's edges.. Screenshot of ColorChecker colors: Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. In addition to a power supply and a USB cable, Asus also includes an earphone with an acceptable sound quality. Product-specific accessories are not listed on Asus' website.. The manufacturer ships its smartphones with a 24-month warranty .. The keyboard app is called ZenUI keyboard, and is thus a component integrated into the operating system. However, it is still possible to switch to Google's standard keyboard or download another keyboard from Google's Play Store. The ZenUI keyboard features relatively big keys. Unfortunately, the user will soon notice that the ZenFone Go has problems with fast typing and the app then does not respond as quickly. Thus, it is not possible to type as quickly as on higher-performance smartphones. This lethargy is also noticed when using Google's GBoard keyboard, so it is really related to the smartphone and not the app. Asus' keyboard offers different themes that allow customizing the keypad, a clipboard for text, and an extra keypad that opens quickly. Overall, the app can be used well, although there are the speed issues that we have mentioned.. The touchscreen's surface is good and responds reliably even in the corners. The software offers many helpful settings for impaired users, a one-hand mode, and ZenMotion integrates several motions and gestures. For example, double-tapping for waking up the smartphone, drawing letters for launching specified apps or muting the smartphone by turning it around.. Three menu touch buttons are found below the screen. They function relatively reliably and are clearly lettered. The standby button's position in the smartphone's upper edge is somewhat unusual. This sometimes involves a slightly longer distance than when it is situated on the right, but on the other hand, it is not pressed accidentally here. The volume control is on the rear, which is a good position when the user has gotten used to it. All keys have a clear pressure point and are quite reliable.. With a screen size of 5 inches and a resolution of 1280x720 pixels, the ZenFone Go is on par with its rivals. Only Huawei P8 lite (2017) offers a Full HD screen. The screen in the review sample has an average brightness of 452 cd/mÂ², which is also class average. The illumination of 84% is not particularly homogeneous: The screen is 76 cd/mÂ² darker in the upper left than lower right when holding the smartphone in landscape mode. Consequently, the brightness of large colored surfaces is noticeably uneven.. 407 cd/m² 452 cd/m² 478 cd/m² 435 cd/m² 459 cd/m² 469 cd/m² 434 cd/m² 453 cd/m² 483 cd/m². 84 % Contrast: 1093:1 (Black: 0.42. cd/m²) ΔE Color 4.5 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 6.5 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 96.23% sRGB (Calman) Gamma: 2.22.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8967 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. The black value of 0.42 cd/mÂ² is also rather mediocre. Black looks more like a dark gray and the backlight is very visible in dark areas. However, this still results in a decent contrast of 1093:1, but the comparison devices offer more here. Colors look rather pale on the screen.. A moderate bluish tint becomes apparent in the lab tests with the spectrophotometer and CalMAN software. However, colors are reproduced quite accurately. Only the cyan and green color rates deviate too strongly. Although the panel cannot be used for exact color monitoring in the professional field, the photos look quite natural. A blue light filter with five levels, which select a warmer white balance, is also installed. This spares the eyes and still contributes to a natural image in levels 1 and 2..

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The viewing angles are good: The displayed content is still quite legible, even when looking from the side, although slight color shifts are visible. The screen's glossy surface is a problem outdoors. The screen's content is still quite legible in the shade, but the eyes have to be strained to quite some extent in order to still see something in bright surroundings.. is to add the performance to Asus' ZenFone Go. However the clock speed of the four cores has been limited to 1 GHz, which involves losses in the processor's power. This leads to frequent stutters and prolonged waiting times when navigating through the relatively undemanding Android OS. Installations and loading times also take a long time. The ZenFone Go is clearly inferior compared with the other devices in the comparison. in particular offers a considerably higher performance.. Like the processor, it is also a few years old and does not support the latest graphics interfaces in the mobile sector. The performance in the lower mid-range is now also much higher as a glance at the benchmarks proves.. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) Asus Zenfone Go ZB500KL.

We examine how fast Asus' ZenFone Go can access both the internal storage and a Toshiba Exceria Pro M40 microSD. Accessing the microSD is relatively slow, and ZenFone Go clearly takes the last place. The ZenFone Go also usually needs longer than the comparison devices to access the internal storage. Only its sequential write speed is roughly on par with the comparison devices. These slow access speeds could also be another reason for the very long loading times for apps and the occasional stutters..

We also tested some games on Asus' ZenFone Go for checking the smartphone's performance here. Mobile games are generally programmed to run on as many smartphones as possible. However, some games provide graphics settings to adapt the game to the smartphone's performance capacity, for example " Asphalt 8 " that we tested. Unfortunately, this is essential for Asus' ZenFone Go. It only achieves an average of 14 frames per second in the highest settings in " Asphalt 8 ", making it unplayable. Smooth 30 frames are achieved in the lowest settings here and in the zombie shooter " Dead Trigger 2 ". Basic games, such as " Angry Birds " also run lag-free. However, the user is not really well-equipped for the future due to the graphics card's lack of support for modern APIs.. Another point that has to be accepted: The loading times are extremely long, and installing games also take eternities. However, controlling games via touchscreen and position sensor is very reliable.. Asus' ZenFone Go does not get exceptionally warm, even when using it in full load for a prolonged time. Nevertheless, 38 Â°C (~100 Â°F) is noticeable. The temperature increase is felt over the entire casing during load, but the handset is a few degrees cooler on the back. We measure a maximum of 34.2 Â°C (~94 Â°F) in idle mode also on the front.. The performance remains stable during prolonged full load as we ascertained with the GFXBench battery test.. 33 °C 35 °C 35.2 °C. 36.1 °C 35.8 °C 38 °C. 36.1 °C 36.4 °C 37.3 °C.

The small speaker on the lower edge is not particularly loud at a maximum of 78.4 dB(A). Basses are almost completely absent, but the mids are quite audible which is very helpful when listening to songs or voices.

Frequency diagram comparison (checkboxes above can be turned on/off!). The ZenFone Go already consumes quite a lot of power when turned off and in standby. We noticed this in the test because the battery was depleted within a few days despite standby mode. The ZenFone Go is not a savings marvel in idle mode either. However, this is not surprising in view of the old SoC. Then again, the load consumption is acceptable and is relatively low with a maximum of 4.22 watts..

In view of the relatively small battery with a capacity of 2600 mAh or 10.1 watt hours, 9:32 hours in the Wi-Fi test are satisfactory. Furthermore, the battery is removable so that a replacement battery for increasing the runtime can be taken along on long trips.

Review sample courtesy of Asus Germany.. With the ZenFone Go, Asus delivers a smartphone that stands firmly at the lower end of the mid-range. The solid casing, removable battery, and camera's decent photos in good light conditions speak for the handset. However, the buyer has to accept the relatively low performance that it presents when navigating through the menu. Furthermore, the GPS module has dropouts and the screen only achieves an average contrast and has an uneven illumination.. In our opinion, it is pleasing that Asus provides its handset with Google's latest security patches via updates. However, an update to the latest operating system should not be expected in this price range. The screen's relatively expansive color accuracy and the good handling are also positives.. The ZenFone Go offers positive aspects, such as the removable battery and solid casing. However, Asus could have given it a bit more power.. Overall, we can recommend the ZenFone Go to users who do not depend on high performance. However, the buyer should be aware that some impressive models from the competition exist, such as. Lenovo's K6 , for the same or just a slightly higher price.. Asus Zenfone Go ZB500KL - 2017-04-03 04/03/2017 v6 Florian Wimmer.

It is also an upgraded variant from the last yearâs Zenfone Go 5.0 LTE. The 2nd-gen device with the model number ZB500KL sports almost similar specifications as its predecessor. From the front of the device, it looks similar to last yearâs Zenfone Go 5.0 LTE with Asus's famous concentric circles design below the capacitive buttons. While the volume rocker is now placed on the rear of the device, the power button sits on the top edge of the device. The device sports an all-metal body and sports a front facing home button. It comes in Glacier Gray, Sheer Gold, Silver Blue, Glamour Red, Charcoal Black and Pearl White colour options. As for hardware specification, the Asus ZenFone Go 5.0 LTE is powered by a Snapdragon 410 MSM8916 quad-core processor clocked at 1.2 GHz.

The fingerprint sensor that comes embedded into the front facing home button can detect from 360-degrees. As for operating system, it runs on Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box.

Аlternative names, under which the model is known.. the horizontal side of the device when it is used in its standard orientation.. the vertical side of the device when it is used in its standard orientation.. Information about the thickness/depth of the device in different measurement units.. Information about the weight of the device in different measurement units.. Estimated volume of the device, calculated from the dimensions provided by the manufacturer. Applies for devices in the form of a rectangular parallelepiped.. Information about the colors, in which the device is available in the market.. Materials used in the fabrication of the device's body.. Information about the type and size (form factor) of the SIM card used in the device.. Information about the number of SIM cards, supported by the device.. Information about some specific features related to the SIM card(s) of the device.. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) was developed to replace the analog cellular network (1G), therefore it is referred to as a 2G mobile network. It has been improved with the addition of General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and later via the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology.. UMTS stands for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System. Based on the GSM standard, it is deemed as a 3G mobile network standard. It has been developed by the 3GPP and its major advantage is the provision of greater bandwidth and spectral efficiency, due to the W-CDMA technology.. LTE is deemed to be the fourth generation (4G) of mobile communications technology. It has been developed by the 3GPP based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies in order to increase the speed and capacity of wireless data networks. A further development of the technology is called LTE Advanced.. There are several network technologies that enhance the performance of mobile networks mainly by increased data bandwidth. Information about the communication technologies supported by the device and their respective uplink and downlink bandwidth.. Information about the operating system used by the device as well as its version.. Name and version of the user interface (UI) used by the operating system (OS).. The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. Some processors have a level 0 cache memory, which is accessed quicker than the L1, L2, L3, and so one cache memories. Besides achieving better performance, it also consumes less power.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. The frequency is the clock rate of the graphic processor (GPU), which is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz)..
