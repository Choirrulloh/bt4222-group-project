Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime - user opinions and reviews. I don't get it why they don't make it in black anymore.. I am confused with this gadget, my Dearest Xiaomi... What is the difference between R4P and RN4X, that makes you left this R4P still on MM? Is the display???. I wish you give a Split Screen and Always on Display; that's all... this phone is becoming a unicorn everywhere. i wanted to buy a spare in case i broke mine but it's sold out in Malaysia. then i searched online and now only gearbest has it but only in gold/white.

The Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime is the top-specced one of the fourth generation, which so far consists of three phones (remember, the Redmi 4 and 4a were announced alongside the 4 Prime). That may very well change though if the Redmi 3 family is any indication - a total of 5 models for the 8 months between January and August this year, and that's not even counting the Redmi Note lineup.. Speaking of the Redmi Notes, it may be worth mentioning where the plain non-Note Redmis sit in the company's lineup - 'ultra-affordable compacts' might be a pretty concise yet accurate summary.. And when you hear ultra-affordable you're thinking a low-end Mediatek chipset, low-res display and a plastic build, probably. Instead, you're getting an efficient 14nm Snapdragon 625 chipset and a FullHD 5-inch display inside a premium metal body. All this for the equivalent of $130!. If you've read any of our previous Redmi reviews you'd be familiar with the 4 Prime's shortcomings - apparently Xiaomi has done its research and figured that NFC and display glass protection are not essential. The non-removable battery has been a thing since the first of the Redmi Threes, but we're sort of fans of the 4,100mAh power-pack, sealed as it may be. We'd also issue a minor complaint on the Android version all while acknowledging that Marshmallow is reasonably okay for a phone in this price bracket.. There is the caveat that the price is such in China, and with Xiaomi not exactly having a global distribution network, you may run into additional costs to get your hands on one of these Redmis. Then there's the matter of warranty, or lack thereof.. While those are legitimate concerns, it's more important just how good of a phone Xiaomi managed to make on such a tight budget. That's why we're here, and we're kicking off with the usual hardware overview on the next page.. Special thanks to HonorBuy for providing the review unit..

The 5-inch screen has a higher 1080 x 1920 resolution, and 3GB of RAM is included along with 32GB of internal storage; that is twice the 16GB of storage available on the Redmi 4. The Redmi 4 Prime features the Snapdragon 625 SoC with an octa-core 2.0GHz and the Adreno 506 GPU.. OS: Android (6.0), Xiaomi MI UI. Dimensions: 5.56 x 2.74 x 0.35 inches (141.3 x 69.6 x 8.9 mm).

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

Mobiles / Xiaomi Mobile Phones / Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime Price in India. Market Status: Coming Soon User Visits: 7,486 Launch Date in India: 21 November, 2018 Compare. The Chinese handset maker, Xiaomi is known for its arsenal of budget friendly smartphones, which are always value for money. It managed to revolutionise the budget segment with the Redmi series of smartphones, which have a device starting from entry level till mid-tier. The brand has launched the 4th generation of its Redmi series of handsets across three variants and they have proven to be pretty good value for money considering the fact that they have been flying off the shelves pretty quick. The Redmi 4 Prime is the beefed up variant of the same and here is why or why should you not buy the device.. All Redmi smartphones since the inception have one thing in common, which is the powerful battery under the rear panel. The Redmi 4 Prime is not an exception since it comes with a beefy 4,100mAh battery powering the smartphone throughout the day. Moreover, the smartphone comes with support for fast charging, which can charge up the device in no time.. In the past, MIUI interface from the brand received a lot flak considering it was loaded to brim with bloatware and was laggy. However, things have changed since then and today MIUI in its 8th iteration is one of the best skin there is. The interface comes loaded with features like dual apps, second space, improved securities and the likes, which are actually useful.. The Xiaomi smartphones have always been lauded for the image quality that their cameras produce and Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime is no exception. The smartphone comes flaunting a 13-megapixel snapper accompanied by dual tone LED flash on the rear panel and 5-megapixel front selfie camera.. One of the main grievances that one can have from the new crop of smartphones is the Hybrid SIM slot, which lets you use either dual SIM or expandable memory with single SIM. Therefore, if you want to use the dual SIM as well as the expandable storage, give this device a miss.. Xiaomi has always been targeting the customer base, who look for premium specs without burning a hole in the pocket. The Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime keeps up with the tradition and is ideal handset for those who are on a tight budget but are on a lookout for a performance device.. Expected Launch Date: 21 November, 2018.

Its design expresses elegance and modern style. Redmi 4 Prime comes with metal body and 5 inch Full HD display. This also ensures decent size and great display quality. However, there is no display protection like Gorilla Glass and 5 inch is relatively small for internet browsing, mobile gaming or watching videos. 5.5" would have been much better for these purposes. But on the other hand, the smaller size makes it easier to carry and smarter while holding in hand or making a call. Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime has all the characteristics for being a premium smartphone. Its network coverage includes 4G, great GPU, amazing camera, CPU, RAM and ROM. Moreover fingerprint sensor, OTG and strong battery backup are included. If smaller display size is not a matter for you, this is definitely a fine choice in this budget range.. User Rating: 3.5 ( 266 votes). Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime Rating by MobileDokan.

It’s an absolute pleasure to hold, albeit slippery. All the features you need are here. This is how all affordable phones should perform. If you’re looking for a sub-$200 Android phone that excels in all aspects, go out and buy Xiaomi’s Redmi 4 Prime. Oops, sorry — I just gave away the conclusion.. I just can’t help but feel there’s not much competition against Xiaomi’s latest budget-friendly smartphone. Heck, we even have a list featuring some of the reasons why it beats everything else .. Still, the Redmi 4 Prime deserves a full review,. Situated at the top of the recently launched Redmi 4 line , the Prime is the costliest of the trio, but not by a huge margin. The price is pegged at $133 in China, with international pricing hovering around $170 , depending on the distributor.. That’s an insanely great deal for a phone this complete — that’s if you can find one. Like most Xiaomi devices, you’ll have to purchase it in China or from one of the many gray market channels, and make sure it actually works on your mobile network.. It’s also important to note that the Redmi 4 Prime officially shares the same name as the standard. The Prime moniker refers to the higher-end variant, but you shouldn’t look for it when shopping online. remember that the Prime has its LED flash to the left of the rear camera lens, while the standard version has its flash to the right.. With a 5-inch display, the Prime has dimensions similar to Google’s 5-inch Pixel flagship. Not that the two phones are in any way comparable beyond that, but the Xiaomi has a full-metal build its credit.. It’s kind of slippery, though, and despite hours’ worth of online digging, I can’t confirm if the display has any sort of protection, like Gorilla Glass or some other anti-shatter glass. Smartphone brands are notorious for keeping this type of info under wraps to hide their cost-cutting practices.. To be safe, look for a protective case. The Redmi 4 Prime is already quite thick at 8.9mm, so it’s not like you’re ruining its figure.. Other than the lack of frontal protection, you get the complete package on the outside: a bright Full HD LCD display, very accurate back-mounted fingerprint scanner, hybrid card tray (has one SIM slot and space for either another SIM or microSD card), and best of all, 4G LTE connectivity.. It would take some nitpicking to complain about the few shortcomings, such as the use of the older micro-USB standard instead of the more future-proof USB-C port, and the lack of NFC, which could have been used for quick wireless pairing with other devices. Most users won’t mind these flaws, because really, this phone is way below $200 in the first place.. What’s really surprising is how Xiaomi was able to equip a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor into this handset. In case you’re unfamiliar with chipsets, this processor is something you’d find on much more expensive midrange smartphones — and not on a phone priced this low.. Seriously, we’re talking about power greater than anything. found in our best budget smartphone feature from last month. And this phone costs as little as the cheapest entry on that list.. It goes without saying that the Redmi 4 Prime performs beyond any other phone at this level. Apps open quickly, most new games run without any hiccups, and keeping tasks in check is aided by 3GB of memory and 32GB of internal storage.. Anyone who’s experienced Xiaomi’s signature interface knows how much of an Apple iOS ripoff it is. But that’s in the past; now, the eighth version of MIUI is mature enough to stand on its own.. MIUI 8 behaves like it should — an Android Marshmallow skin through and through. This isn’t to say it’s any closer to the operating system it’s built on, but it’s a lot more Android-like this time, without losing any of the deep customizations MIUI is known for.. Can’t follow? All you have to know is that the Prime’s software is user-friendly and colorful, yet still offers lots of options for adjusting the look and feel of the interface.. Normally, when you discover a phone this cheap, it’s the cameras that take the biggest hit. That isn’t the case here, however; the Redmi 4 Prime’s 5-megapixel front and 13-megapixel rear shooters are surprisingly good, and not just for entry-level standards. As you can see, colors are vibrant whether HDR mode is on or not, and the sharpness is fantastic all throughout each photo. at night wasn’t that bad either, but you’ll have to keep your hands steady since there’s no image stabilization to assist you. If all else fails, you can make use of the dual-tone LED flash.. Same sentiments can be said for video recording, except there’s one minor. caveat: Audio recording turns into a jumbled-up mess when recording heavy bass. I experienced this firsthand at a concert; standing close to the speakers while shooting was a terrible idea.. I can’t believe I’m saving this part for last: The Prime’s battery is such a beast! While it shouldn’t be much of a surprise with it having a large. phones with similar batteries simply aren’t as efficient as this.. I was able to record six and a half hours of screen-on time on a single charge, which included lots of time playing. If I were to tone each of those down, over seven hours of active usage is quite realistic.. This leads to an endurance of two days with heavy usage — three days if you play more sparingly. We can credit these numbers to the energy-efficient processor and display panel, as well as the lighter MIUI implementation.. My only knock against it is the lack of fast charging. Using the bundled charger, it takes more or less two and a half hours to fill up the Redmi 4 Prime from zero percent. It’s a small price to pay for over a day of use, though.. There are only a few reasons why the Redmi 4 Prime might not be for you: It lacks NFC connectivity; charging times are painstakingly slow; and you might have a difficult time finding one.. The first two may not actually matter to most consumers, but the third reason. Unless you have a reliable gray market source , securing a unit in the US or any non-Asian country can be cumbersome.. If you do manage to purchase the Redmi 4 Prime, congratulations! You’ll have a tough time finding a better deal at this price point. The only possible threat is the pending release of the slightly pricier Mi 5c , although I doubt it’ll undermine any of the Prime’s qualities.. You can also consider the similarly priced Vivo Y55 , but none of its specs — from the display resolution to the processor and memory — can match the Redmi 4 Prime’s..

Here’s everything the Authorized Mi Store in the Philippines sells. Extra features to enjoy (depending on where you are). With the influx of smartwatches available today, it sometimes gets confusing to choose which specific device suits your needs. Although they all have a common purpose, some of these wearables cater to specific audiences. There are the straightforward variants that simply track your activities, or smartwatches with unique designs that will cost you .. There are also those that boast built-in features.. This is where the LG Watch Sport comes in as it runs on the latest Android. Wear 2.0 OS and comes with goodies not usually seen on normal smartwatches.. The LG Watch Sport doesn’t have the rotating bezel of the Samsung Gear S3 or the textured strap of the Fitbit Ionic. No, it flaunts a plain design for the bezel with a simple strap devoid of anything eye-catching.. Still, I personally like how it’s made. The watch itself is a bit thick, but nothing out of the ordinary when you compare it against other smartwatches.. The 1.38-inch circular P-OLED display has pleasing colors even under sunlight and viewing angles are decent.. On its right side, there are three buttons with the main crown having the ability to rotate. The top button launches Google Fit in an instant while the bottom is for Android Pay.. When you turn it over on its belly, you’ll be introduced to its heart rate sensor. It’s also worth noting that since this is activewear, the body is sealed to have an IP68 certification. This means it can withstand sweat, a shower, and even being submerged in up to 1.5m of water for 30 minutes.. The Watch Sport charges wirelessly through its included cradle. Just plug the USB-C cable and dock the watch to charge. This has always been my preferred charging setup — better than fumbling while trying to connect the cable to the device.. As mentioned earlier, the Watch Sport already runs on Android Wear 2.0. It now comes with design updates and needed features that make the experience more enjoyable as a whole.. are fun to switch around from time to time, and standalone apps make the watch easily accessible in just a few taps.. One press of the middle button and the available apps come as a scrolling list. Apart from swiping the display to browse through them, rotating the crown scrolls through the selection which gives the experience a more tactile feel.. The LG Watch proves to be responsive when you’re swiping across the display, but tapping on selections sometimes need be done knowingly — precise and with a bit of effort.. Overall, it’s been pretty easy to navigate through its menu and submenu, even if the user isn’t familiar with the Android ecosystem.. The Sport in its name should be a dead giveaway that it focuses on your activities. Google Fit is a capable assistant during training or workout sessions as it works in tandem with the heart rate sensor to give users real-time info like BPM and calories burned.. The standalone app is accompanied by vast selections of exercise trackers ranging from backcountry skiing to kickboxing. If you’re just in the gym lifting weights, Strength Training mode is the way to go; it will give you a summary of how your workout went.. I’d say that a big chunk of why I appreciate this smartwatch is the fact that it’s somehow centered around Google Fit. The one-press button to launch and scrolling to browse through its activity features make it easy to just have it on your wrist when you hit the gym.. Watch Sport isn’t just useful when you’re sweating it out. LG also made it capable to be used for everyday payments through Android Pay. Although there’s already a fair number of countries that support this system, it’s still not available widely so that’s one thing to consider.. Another thing is that the watch accepts a nano-SIM card which allows users to still be connected without using a phone. The problem is, it works only in the US, as other countries don’t currently support full features (like NumberSync).. But then again, most smartwatches don’t excel in this department. This is because it’s always been a challenge to equip watches with a large capacity pack while at the same time making the shell as thin as possible.. In real-life use, taking it off its charging cradle in the morning will last you for about 10 hours, so you’ll barely make it in time back to your place to charge. Activate its always-on display and expect battery life to drain almost twice as fast.. The LG Watch Sport is easily a friend to gym buffs and fitness freaks, if you have the US$ 300 budget. It might not help list down your caloric or water intake, but it will be with you every step of your training.. It does all the things that a usual smartwatch does, but it’s just a bit of a downer that you have to be in select places to fully take advantage of its features (although I still enjoy mine with no Android Pay and SIM connectivity).. At the end of the day, it’s your routine and what you do that dictates your need for devices like this.. Is the LG Watch Sport your GadgetMatch?. Fitbit Ionic review: What forced me to get fit. Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus (Redmi Note 5) Review. The Redmi 5 Plus is all about its new 5.99-inch 18:9 display. It’s supposed to be a “near-borderless” phone but the bezels are still quite thick. On top of the phone are the audio port, secondary microphone, and IR blaster. At the bottom are the aging micro-USB port and loudspeakers. The power button and volume rocker are on the right side. The card tray on the left is a hybrid slot for nano-SIM and microSD cards. The back houses the fingerprint sensor and primary camera along with the LED flash. MIUI 9 is at the helm but still based on Nougat. Redmi embraces the new display ratio. Longevity is where the phone triumphs. Xiaomi’s latest budget offering finally arrived in our office and I used it as my daily driver to see if it lives up to its hype. We all know Xiaomi offers the best specs to price ratio, but is the Redmi 5 Plus (known as the Redmi Note 5 in India) the new budget phone king?. Embracing the latest tall display trend. The chin is thicker than the forehead. Xiaomi sticks with infrared for controlling appliances. When will Xiaomi shift to USB-C for their budget phones?. Both have the same texture, so you’ll have to get familiar with them. You can’t have the best of both worlds. The back is reminiscent of the predecessors. The UI looks great on the longer display. Last year, we saw the trend of tall displays. The new 18:9 standard was not exclusive to the bezel-less flagships, as we have seen them even with midrange phones — then to budget devices. It’s expected that other budget-centric brands like Xiaomi will release their own for the masses, and that gave birth to the Redmi 5. The one we have here is the Plus variant which has a bigger IPS LCD with wide-viewing angles and good color reproduction.. I see Xiaomi as the pioneer of bezel-less phones with the Mi Mix , but they had to make some cuts to keep it within the range of Redmi phones. So, the Redmi 5 Plus still has some bezels all around the display. It’s noticeable that the bottom bezel or the chin is slightly thicker than the top.. As mentioned earlier, the back of the phone looks and feels like its predecessor. The front might look different thanks to the 18:9 display ratio and reduced bezels, but the back is oddly similar. If we are to compare the Redmi 5 Plus to the Redmi Note 4, the latter will just look stouter. The rear camera placement is the same, as well as the LED flash and fingerprint reader. Even the mixed aluminum and plastic build sports the same trick for seamless mixing.. The real specs upgrade for the Redmi 5 series is found on the Redmi 5 Note Pro — not on this one. The Redmi 5 Plus (or Redmi 5 Note) is virtually identical to its predecessor with the same Snapdragon 625 processor, up to 4GB of memory, and up to 64GB of storage. Our review unit has the highest-end configuration with 4GB and 64GB of memory and storage, respectively. While the Snapdragon 625 is an efficient chipset, it’s already showing signs. The processor powering the phone was released back in 2016, and it’s been well-received especially on budget devices from Xiaomi. But with all the extra features that apps are getting, the phone might not be able to keep up for long. For instance, it’s a bit laggy when posting videos or Boomerang clips on Instagram Stories, and I’m getting longer waiting times when opening certain games. Software optimization could address these issues, though.. When it comes to gaming, you shouldn’t worry. The usual mobile games I play like Asphalt Extreme and. fine even on high settings, but you’ll have to turn off some extra effects to get better frame rates. General phone use was also good with little to no hiccups.. The phone runs MIUI 9 out of the box but still based on Android 7.1 Nougat. While I can’t hate MIUI because of its speed and additional features on top of stock Android, it can get quite cumbersome at times with settings and permissions. MIUI 9 is a refinement of everything the MIUI team learned from previous versions and it’s still as colorful as before. There’s no news if it’ll get an update to Android 8.0 Oreo, but with MIUI 9 at the helm, it doesn’t really matter since you already have most of the new Android features and important security patches.. Even with their flagship devices, Xiaomi can’t pull off. So, what should we expect from their budget phones like the Redmi 5 Plus? The phone is equipped with a 12-megapixel primary shooter accompanied by a dual-tone LED flash. According to spec sheets, the aperture of the lens is just f /2.2 which is disappointing and it shows when shooting in dim environments. Night shots are also just so-so, so don’t expect the phone to capture plenty of details.. As for selfies, there’s a 5-megapixel front shooter that has the usual Xiaomi beauty effect that somehow doesn’t work well with my face, so I turned it off most of the time. It’s also not as wide as other selfie phones.. One thing I like about Xiaomi’s camera is its launcher. There are also a few modes you can jump into if you want to get the best possible shot depending on the subject.. Battery life is perhaps the most important aspect of an entry-level phone. If you’re sticking to a budget, you might not get the best camera but it should at least last the whole day on a single charge. With a 4000mAh battery, the Redmi 5 Plus can.. After using the phone as my daily driver for more than a week, I rarely looked for the charger. I don’t even worry about running out of juice while on the road. Based on actual usage, the phone can last for more than 24 hours with about eight hours of screen-on time. On a really busy day, the phone can do around 20 hours. If you’re wondering, my usage is all about mobile data. I connect to Wi-Fi from time to time when in the office and at home, but LTE is my savior when in public places.. If you’re a Redmi fan looking for an upgrade, you might want to skip this one. The true upgrade is found on the Redmi Note 5 Pro with its latest processor and familiar-looking rear cameras. If still available, you can opt for the good old Redmi Note 4 which is supposedly cheaper now with the new releases in the market.. Honestly, it’s disappointing to see Xiaomi recycling their design for the budget series. The Redmi 5 Plus doesn’t bring anything new to the table even with its 18:9 display. But, that could have been the point of the phone all along since they released the Redmi Note 5 Pro shortly after.. The Redmi 5 Plus starts at CNY 999 or around US$ 150 for the base 3GB/32GB model, while the top-of-the-line 4GB/64GB variant sells for CNY 1,299 or about US$ 180. You can purchase the Redmi 5 Plus just like the one we have from GearBest .. GoPro HERO 6 Black vs HERO 5 Black Comparison. Which is the action camera for you?. GoPro is one of the biggest names in sports videography a nd is a name that first comes to mind when the need for a portable, easy-to-set-up camera arises.. Although, the past couple of years were a bit hard for the company as sales plummeted, and after introducing their first-ever drone, some literally fell from the sky.. Still working hard on making another hit, GoPro has returned with their latest action camera, the HERO 6 Black , and it boasts some pretty impressive features.. Will it be the saving grace the company needs right now?. How does it fare compared to its predecessor, the HERO 5?. We answer those questions plus more in this comparison.. On the outside, nothing has changed with the new action camera at all.. It’s made of the same robust, rubbery material that’s designed to go underwater for as deep as 10 meters without needing an extra waterproof case.. Button placements are carried over — one up top to start recording and another one on its side to switch between shooting modes.. Underneath, the same 1220mAh battery is stored while connectivity ports are on the other side.. Even the protective lens is still removable and replaceable.. There’s virtually no way of telling the two apart. except for the small print on the side of the camera.. The biggest upgrade of the HERO 6 has more to do with output. It can now shoot up to 4K resolution at 60fps, whereas the previous HERO 5 topped out at 4K 30fps.. It might seem like a small detail but having the option to shoot smoother video is always a good thing.. The HERO 5 Black can capture videos at a speedy 240fps but resolution is limited to 720p.. The newer HERO 6 Black, on the other hand, can shoot the same 240fps rate at a clearer 1080p resolution.. For more flexibility, the HERO 6 can also shoot at 2.7K at 120fps so you get nice slow-mo video with the ability to resize or re-scale your footage if the need arises.. Other features that differentiate the new action camera from its predecessor include better low-light performance and dynamic range.. Of course, all this means nothing if we can’t see for ourselves.. I brought both cameras during my travels and you may refer to the embedded video below (starting at 2:46) for some sample video comparisons.. You can easily see that the sky from the HERO 6’s shots is more vibrant than the pale blue color from the HERO 5. There’s also a noticeable difference in exposure. The HERO 5 has darker blacks which, in this case, worked well since it was able to bring out more details on the snowy mountain.. Although both are set to auto white balance, footage from the HERO 5 still turns out to be warmer as seen in the indoor shoot.. In terms of stabilization, the new HERO 6 really stepped up its game to remove unwanted jerks and jitters.. The difference is day and night, and it’s impressive how the HERO 6 almost looks like it was mounted on a gimbal thanks to its electronic image stabilization.. Don’t get us wrong, the HERO 5 also has its own EIS, but just not as good as the new flagship’s.. One more thing to notice when the camera’s EIS is turned on is that the HERO 5 needs to crop the image by 10 percent to achieve a smoother shot, while the HERO 6 has improved this and only crops about 5 percent of the original image.. Additionally, stabilization on the HERO 5 can only be used until 2.7K resolution at 60fps, while the HERO 6 supports stabilization until 4K. The only limitation here is that EIS maxes out at 30fps with no support for the higher 60fps.. Footage taken with the older HERO 5 couldn’t achieve the same level of clarity shot on the HERO 6. Colors are also livelier and digital noise has been reduced significantly on the latter.. Although there were instances, like when we went ice skating, that we preferred the color and details shot by the HERO 5. It looked more natural and the ice on the floor is still visible, unlike the one shot by the HERO 6.. We now look at some photo samples from both action cameras.. This photo was taken at Italy’s oldest shopping mall and shows a good balance between light and dark areas.. We like how the HERO 5 has a higher contrast which added detail to the metal structure of the mall.. While waiting for a train, we see the sun lighting the Swiss Alps from behind with a dark and shaded station in the foreground. Again, we see a more vibrant blue sky from the HERO 6 with good details.. But look closer on the warning sign in front of you and the HERO 5 was actually able to deliver a better, more legible image. Even when you crop them to 100 percent, the smallest details seem to appear better on the HERO 5.. At night, both proved to be capable shooters, but the HERO 6 showed more details by effectively capturing the cracks on the floor.. One thing that I had been complaining about with my HERO 5 is that. it easily overshoots light flares, creating an unwanted glow and losing details.. It’s very much distracting here since it washed out the person’s face. Meanwhile, we’re happy that it was addressed on the HERO 6 as it’s clearly the better photo.. Zooming in to 100 percent shows that the green motorcycle has a livelier color and less noise on the HERO 6 compared to its predecessor.. As mentioned earlier in this video, the HERO 6 Black carries the same 1220mAh battery capacity as the HERO 5 Black.. So it should technically last for the same amount of time right?. We conducted a battery test on the two at full capacities, same video settings, and started recording until they both drained their batteries.. After more than an hour and a half, the HERO 6 actually gave up first at 1 hour and 42 minutes while the HERO 5 continued on and reached 2 hours and 5 minutes.. That’s 23 minutes of difference and could go a long way in real-world shooting.. Responsible for this result might be the HERO 6’s newer custom processor. Yes, it could produce better dynamic range, low light shots, and stabilize the camera really well — but at the cost of a more power-hungry chip. T hat’s definitely a trade-off to consider.. So the question here is this:. Should you upgrade to a HERO 6 Black from a HERO 5 Black?. Well, you first have to ask yourself the question: Will you be using it to shoot serious action scenes with really fast movement?. Are you after the best quality there is? Or are you more of a casual user who just uses a sports camera to document your out-of-town trips?. Because if it’s not for professional work, the HERO 5 Black is more than capable to document all your trips.. It’s also worth every penny since it just dropped its price to US$ 299, making it a really attractive offering — n ot to mention longer battery life.. Although if you plan to use your action videos for broadcast and want to have a lot of flexibility in shooting and editing, then you can’t go wrong with the HERO 6 Black at US$ 399..

Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime Specifications Review, Features and Price in India. Touted to be an 'Ultra-affordable compact phone', the Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime was launched a couple of months back in the company's native country, China. The dual-SIM phone is a part of the fourth generation of Redmis to come out, alongside the Redmi 4 and Redmi 4a. Coming to the specifications, the Redmi 4 Prime features a 2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor combined with 3 gigs of RAM. It packs a 4100mAh battery and runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Along with that, it features an in-built storage space of 32GB which can be further extended to a maximum of 128GB. As is the custom with Xiaomi phones, the Redmi 4 Prime contains the company's MIUI skin, in this case, the MIUI8. The phone features a satin-finished metal back and a slightly curved 2.5D glass along with a 5-inch screen and for photography, contains a 13MP camera on the back along with a 5MP one on the front with both featuring f/2.2 aperture.

Hybrid SIM No NFC Launches on Android Marshmallow. The Redmi 4 Prime measures 141.3 x 69.6 x 8.9mm - precisely as wide as the Redmi Threes, but marginally taller and thicker. It's also gotten heavier by some 12g and now tips the scales at 156g. That seems to be a direct consequence of the more premium build, as battery capacity hasn't been increased. The satin-finished metal back, the polished chamfers of the frame, the very slight curve of the 2.5D glass - it's everything you'd expect to find on a device costing 3 times as much, at least..

Phones Reviews Xiaomi News Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime Review: Long Live the Battery King. By Zi Jin Cheng -. Xiaomi Redmi 4 Full Review. 5.0″ 1920 x 1080 px, IPS LCD. 156g, 141.3 x 69.6 x 8.9 mm. Xiaomi Redmi 4 Video Review. Xiaomi has done what I thought was impossible; drastically improve battery life on this phone. I’m not denying that there are phones out there that top this; the Oukitel K10000 comes to mind, but in a still vaguely phone like package? Not in the slightest. There have recently been a slew of reviews hailing the Moto Z Play (same processor, 3510mAh battery) as a great phone for the battery life, and I would like to introduce them, and all of you to the reigning champion.. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Redmi 4 Prime.. Battery life isn’t the only area in which the Redmi 4 Prime has improved. In fact, the $30 price hike over the Redmi 3 allowed for an improvement in almost every way; a full HD screen, the new Snapdragon 625 processor, and a very Redmi Pro -like metal body.. The Redmi 4, like all the other Redmi devices that came before it, is a great budget device, no doubt about that. But the Redmi 4 Prime does so much more. It not only blows the price/performance curve out of the water, it packs “midrange” specifications into a truly budget price point.. With Xiaomi’s track record, especially with Redmi and Redmi Note devices, we were. expecting a great device here, and the Redmi 4 Prime does not disappoint.. Big thanks to Gearbest for providing this review unit. I used the Xiaomi Redmi 4 on Fido in Toronto.. Xiaomi has left behind the traditional Redmi 3 /Redmi Note 3 designs in favour of the more elegant curved back designs as seen in the Redmi Pro, Mi Note 2, and the Mi 5s. The curve on the body is less pronounced on this Redmi 4 compared to other non Redmi/Redmi Note devices and is a move in the right direction. The Redmi 4 is slightly thicker (8.9mm vs 8.5mm) than the Redmi 3 but still feels thinner because of the curved back.. I can easily use this device with just one hand which is welcome, not many 5” devices with specs worth their salt are released anymore. The build quality is expectedly top notch, with the same matte metal finish found on the Redmi Note 4 and the Mi5s, screaming quality without trying to dive towards the floor every other second.. The back of the phone features the camera (which thankfully doesn’t protrude out), the flash and the fingerprint sensor.. Xiaomi has done a bang up job with the build quality here, not many phones can claim that honour in such a budget phone with the Ulefone Metal coming to mind, but the processor on that was somewhat old.. This is the first Redmi device to feature a 1080p screen, and it definitely looks good. Colours are deep and the screen is sharp. There is still a difference between the screen on the Redmi 4 and more expensive displays, but the difference is small.. I feel that Xiaomi could have left the resolution at 720p with all the benefits that would bring; longer battery life, a better gaming experience, and less SoC usage. You might not think there is a huge difference between 720p and 1080p, but 720p only has around 900,000 total pixels while 1080p has over 2,000,000 pixels, meaning that the SoC has to work almost exactly twice as hard on 1080p.. Maximum brightness is around 450-500 nits which is easy enough to see in sunlight, but not as easy as the Mi5s with 600 nits. There is also Gorilla Glass as well.. The speakers are located beside the MicroUSB plug, and they produce some very loud sound, not as loud as the Mi5s, but definitely more than loud enough. Quality is a little below average, with bass almost nonexistent and passable mids and highs.. However, I’m trying my best not to be harsh here as this phone has an MSRP of $130, which is almost 3 times cheaper than the Mi5s and 5 times cheaper than the Mi Note 2.. Who would have thought that the battery in the Redmi 4 could surprise me any further. The Redmi 3 had insane battery life, easily getting 6 hours of battery life with 25% left. However, the Redmi 4 managed to top that and not by a bit, but by miles.. With this new Redmi 4, I was able to get 9 hours of screen on time with 25% left, and with that increase, battery life has officially crossed from insane to out of this world. There is nobody in this world that uses their phone for 9 hours a day daily, and if you do, this phone is the perfect device for you.. It was also able to get 10 hours of screen on time over two days (5 hours each day) with about 3% left at 8pm on the second day. I spent almost 96 hours testing this darn. battery in various configurations and I desperately need sleep!. I also did some lab testing with the battery (do I even need to?), and the phone was able to browse the web for almost 16 hours straight and it could play back video for 19 hours in total. Who would have thought that the new Snapdragon 625 was that power efficient? I wanted to do more battery tests but because each battery test took up the better part of a day I was not able to perform more tests on this incredible battery.. The stock charger does not support QuickCharge, so it does take a while (about 2.5-3 hours) for the phone to be charged up. Using my Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0 charger it was able to charge up to 50% in about 45 minutes.. It’s still using the old MicroUSB connector which is annoying. Heavy and ultra heavy users (like me) can easily go two days without charging, while light and medium users can definitely go four days and possibly even a week without charging.. “The battery is not of this world”. Still not a fan of MIUI, and I’ll be repeating that for every single Xiaomi phone I review. There is MIUI8 over top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow and the included Snapdragon 625 chugs along quite well. I know I usually talk about Antutu at the end of this section, but this SoC as high or higher than some Helio P10 chipsets. Benchmarks do not directly translate into everyday performance, but in this case real world use backs it up.. Vernee Active Review: The Best Looking Rugged Phone. General use, swiping between screens, and opening and closing apps was all very fast a fluid. Sure, its a tad slower than Snapdragon 821 devices, but not by much. The Snapdragon 625 coupled with 3GB of RAM makes it a very capable multitasker as well. This phone is no gaming powerhouse, but it can play most of the games on the play store with good framerates when the settings are on lowest.. Benchmarks do not directly translate into everyday performance, however real world use yielded some strange results. There was noticeable stuttering when swiping, opening and closing apps and this is most likely because of the software. There is no reason why the 625 should stutter in basic tasks at all and hopefully Xiaomi releases a fix for this.. The 625 is also no gaming powerhouse, yes it can play intense games, but definitely not on highest. The GPU is weak enough to notice some lag if you try playing intense games on highest settings; you’ll have to bump the settings down to medium or low.. The rear mounted fingerprint sensor works very well and is fast, accurate and well situated. I’m able to reach for it easily every time. However, I’ve become extremely accustomed to front mounted fingerprint sensors so it was a little bit of a transition.. I found the choice of network bands strange for a company trying to sell them outside of China. There are actually less FDD-LTE bands and more TDD-LTE bands which are mostly useless outside of Asia. That being said, I was still able to get strong 3G and LTE connections here in Canada, but pay extra close attention to the network bands and make sure it works on your carrier.. WiFi, Bluetooth and GPS all work well, I found that Bluetooth range on the Redmi 4 is actually farther than the Lenovo Z2 Plus, my daily driver. There is also an IR blaster which at this point is kind of useless. There is a microSD card slot that supports microSD cards up to 128GB as well.. The camera does surprisingly well in great lighting conditions. After seeing the videos and photos of the Mi5s and Mi Note 2, I was prepared to be disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised. There is more than enough detail in each shot and colours are reproduced nicely. In great lighting conditions, photos are slightly less vivid and detailed than what is found on the more expensive Xiaomi models but still more than adequate.. The camera takes photos incredibly fast as well, not as fast as the Mi5s, but competitive. However, move to low light and the picture quality drops much faster than the Mi5s. The front facing camera takes average photos, and low light brings out a lot of noise and grain. The video camera can shoot up to 1080p video and video quality obviously doesn’t match up to pretty much any decent 4k shooter, but its definitely good for a full HD camera. Colours are markedly less vivid compared to the Mi5s though. Low light video shooting is actually kind of bad, not only is there noise and blown out colours, but video starts getting quite shaky.. Xiaomi has had a lot of time to refine the Redmi. Each successive Redmi was a big jump from the previous one, but the Redmi 4 Prime is the biggest one yet. Starting at $130, it has made the leap from a budget, low end smartphone into a midrange one, competing quite easily against Helio P10 phones.. As a budget phone kind of guy, this phone represents the epitome of what I consider to be the most consumer-friendly phone, striking a perfect balance between price, specifications, and user experience.. Yes there are imperfections (a subjective one being the fact that I dislike MIUI), the speaker is barely average, and the camera has disappointing low light performance. But the Redmi 4 Prime does so much to advance our mindset of what a budget phone can contain. It keeps other phone manufacturers on their feet, and in the end, the consumer benefits.. Xiaomi has done a great service to anyone purchasing this phone as they have improved on already amazing battery life, giving heavy users two days of battery life which is completely unheard of. This is definitely my top pick for a budget device going forward and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an amazing device for less.. Note: November 26, 2016, even though this phone was released by Xiaomi at $130, reseller prices rise to around $200 which is ludicrous. Average resale prices hover around $160-$180, and at that price, you might as well purchase a Redmi Note 4 instead. However if you can find the Redmi 4 Prime for $130 or close to that, that is the best budget device you can get.. I would like to thank Gearbest for sending out this review unit, and if you would like to buy one, you can do so here ..

Kavya Dupati , studied at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad. Answered May 18, 2017 · Author has 83 answers and 83.7k answer views. Hi, it was the awesome product from Mi. Buy Redmi 4 amazon is going for sale on 23rd May at 12Pm it would be similar to Redmi note 4. the phone is released in 3 variants based on RAM & ROM. Redmi 4 with 2GB RAM +16GB storage at Rs 6,999, the Redmi 4 with 3GB RAM+32GB storage at Rs 8,999, and finally Redmi 4 with 4GB RAM+64GB storage at Rs 10,999.. Xiaomi has taken one step further by introducing a 64GB storage variant for its budget smartphone. Redmi 4 now comes in a matte black variant, similar to the Redmi Note 4, and there’s a gold color variant as well.. Redmi 4 is like a mini version of the Redmi Note 4. This phone sports a metal uni-body design similar to the Redmi Note 4 series, except this one has a 5-inch HD display compared to the former’s 5.5-inch full HD one. The dual, CNC-drilled speakers are now at the bottom of the device, and in the middle is the micro-USB port. It has a slightly curved back with antenna bands running on top and the bottom; the headphone jack is on top of the phone.Overall, the 5-inch form factor makes this a very compact device to hold. However, the Redmi 4 is prone to picking up smudges, especially on the back. So get a cover and tempered glass for the front as well to avoid screen disasters. For those who like a 5-inch phone, the Redmi 4 remains a good-looking option to consider. Redmi 4 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor. On the display front, this one sports a 5-inch HD display, which works well in all lighting conditions, even bright sunlight. For a budget phone, this is one of the better displays you can get in the market.. I’ve been using the Redmi 4 for the past couple of days, and so far I wouldn’t say general performance is an issue. The phone is powered by a Qualcomm octa-core Snapdragon 435 processor and has 3GB RAM + 32GB storage, which can be expanded via a microSD card.For your daily social media consumption, be it YouTube or Facebook, or daily messaging, this phone is good enough. It performs the basic tasks without any hiccups.. Camera Redmi 4 comes with a 13MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. The front camera is acceptable I would say, though the software kept tagging me as a 44-year-old male, which is not very flattering. The rear camera is not the fastest, and while colours like red appear a bit washed out, the overall picture composition is not so bad. Overall, I would say the camera is pretty standard on the Redmi 4, and delivers a good experience given the price of the phone. On the low-light shots, I still have to test out this phone some more.. Xiaomi has made this the USP of the Redmi series. Redmi 4 has a 4100 mAh battery, which will easily last a day. However, there is no fast-charging and the phone takes a good three hours plus to get to 100 per cent. But even if you charge this phone at 50 per cent, you should be able to get more than a day with moderate to heavy usage.. promoted by MIT Sloan Executive Education. 3-month advanced online course by MIT Sloan.
