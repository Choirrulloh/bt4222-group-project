CNET también está disponible en español.. Mix-and-match design can't beat Samsung's S7. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The LG G5's unique modular design lets you swap in fun accessories. It has (two!) great rear cameras, expandable storage and a replaceable battery -- a rarity in high-end phones.. The Bad Although you can swap out some parts, there aren't enough to make this feature compelling. You can only access the phone's app drawer in a specialized theme.. The Bottom Line This is the phone to get if you want a removable battery, but it fails to live up to its world-changing Swiss Army Knife potential.. Design: This is not your modular fantasy. Camera: Two cameras are better than one. LG phones often play it safe, but this modular G5, which lets you swap out some parts, is all risk. I love the innovation -- no other company has gotten this far with a modular phone -- but unfortunately the device falls short on execution.. Swapping out parts means you turn off your smartphone each time, and there just aren't enough modules right now to make this truly captivating. (LG is selling two components, but they don't pique my interest all that much.) Maybe if there were more inspired modules, and more partners on board lining up cooler add-ons -- I love the idea of a swappable camera lens, for example -- I could be more excited about the G5, or at least more forgiving of its growing pains.. But it's not all bad news. Forget the modules and the device is the best handset with a removable battery, which is becoming a rarity in the phone world. Its aluminium build looks and feels great, and the two cameras on its back are a pleasure to use.. Overall, the G5 still isn't as good as Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge when it comes to processing speed and battery life, but it'll work very well for all the things you really need to do: take photos, browse the internet, and watch videos throughout the day.. (For more on the G5's hardware specs and how it compares to other flagship handsets, scroll to the end of the review.). LG's elegant and unorthodox G5 (pictures). When LG first showed off the G5, it made a big deal of it being the first phone with modular capabilities. This ability to swap out and customize certain hardware parts has been a longtime fantasy for mobile users. Like building a personal computer, you can upgrade certain components that are important to you or fit a certain need. If you're going somewhere where you're going to take a variety of photos, for example, you might want to swap out your handset's stock lens for a fisheye or macro lens.. To use the feature, you'll need to push the small button on the device's left edge. The bottom of the G5 will pop out, allowing you to yank the attachment off the battery, clip the battery into the new module and push it all back together. Because the battery is attached to the bezel, the handset powers down every time you swap something out. This isn't a huge deal, but it takes time to fire up the phone after a switch, and if you swap parts often throughout the day it can be a power drain.. The G5's bottom bezel can be removed and swapped out for another accessory.. Google attempted to make a modular handset with its Project Ara , but development on that stalled. The fact that LG got this off the ground is a win, but the feature is limited for now because there are only two accessories (so far) that take advantage of it.. One is called the Cam Plus. It's a camera grip that has a physical shutter button to record and capture video, and a zooming wheel. It also has a built-in battery, which you can use on top of the phone's battery for extra juice. The other accessory is the Hi-Fi Plus , a portable digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that boosts audio playback for high-definition sound files. Because the Hi-Fi Plus includes an audio grill, a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack, you can leave it attached to your G5 and use it all the time.. The LG Cam Plus camera grip, which can attach to the handset.. Swapping out the bottom bezel was a bit difficult at first. The pieces fit tightly, and the unlock button that lets you to detach the chin lies flush with the surface of the device, so I had to dig my nail in to press it. After a while, I got the hang of it and got faster at swapping the parts out. That doesn't mean I ever got to the point where I could walk around, stop and switch out the bezel casually. There's still some wrangling involved, and due to the sheer fear that I'd accidentally fling the top part of the handset across the room when I pulled out the chin, I felt compelled to find a place to sit down to switch out the parts.. With these two official add-ons and no plans to make more, LG will need to rely on third-party developers to expand the usefulness of the phone's current modular features. As a top-tier handset in and of itself, the G5 is a great device. But solely in terms of modularity, it has a ways to go.. VR headsets, robot balls and snap-on phone gadgets: Say hello to LG's amazing new G5 accessories. You know the saying, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"? Well, LG tried to fix it.. On the refreshed user interface for the G5, LG buried the option to have an app drawer, the grid of icons that holds all of your apps. A bunch of other Android phone-makers, such as Huawei and Xiaomi, do something similar by getting rid of the drawer altogether, but if you aren't used to it, it can drive you crazy.. I like the app drawer, as this iPhone-like layout means I can't organize my homepages exactly how I want. If you want the drawer back you'll need to dive into Settings and launch a totally different layout called EasyHome. ( Hat tip to Techno Buffalo for pointing this out .) Unfortunately, the EasyHome theme enlarges the font size on your home screen, which you can't adjust, and gets rid of the dashboard, which is a row of up to five apps that you can choose to display on the bottom of your home page.. The device's Home layout (left) without an app drawer, and the simpler EasyHome layout (right) which has an app drawer but removes the bottom dashboard of apps.. Basically, you have to choose between having a dashboard and no app drawer, or an app drawer with no dashboard and really big text. Luckily, there are some software goodies to help counterbalance this. Like the Galaxy S7, the screen continuously displays the time, date and any missed notifications on the display, even when the handset is sleeping. Because the information is "always on," you won't have to wake it up or wave your hand over the screen (like on Motorola phones).. The feature is useful, and it does save me a tap whenever I want to check the time. However, it's limited compared to Samsung's always-on feature. With the Galaxy S7 you can choose different clock faces and there's a monthly calendar option. On the G5 you can add a "welcome message" but that's pretty much it. And while its always-on text is visible in sunlight, it's not as bright as on the S7.. Editors' note, May 3: LG has said an over-the-air update will add an option called "Home and app drawer" that simply adds the drawer to the standard home layout .. The G5 has two cameras in the back: a 16-megapixel camera with a standard 78-degree wide lens and an 8-megapixel camera with a wide-angle, 135-degree lens. The wider lens lets you capture more space within each frame.. At first I wasn't too excited about this. I thought a wide-angle lens made more sense on the front (like how the LG V10 had it) so you can include more people in your group selfies. Turns out that having a wide-angle lens on the back is useful if you're more into sweeping landscapes than selfies (which I am). And because you can seamlessly switch between the lenses by zooming in and out on the camera's interface, it's easy to quickly snap two versions of every scene I wanted to capture..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars A Fantastic Device with some minor issues. Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. It took me quite some time, for the last 3 months I have been contemplating what type of phone I was going to pickup. I had an interesting road leading up to the last couple of months, I had an LG G4 that boot looped at the end of January 2016, causing me to sell the phone for parts. Since it was a factory unlocked device (H815 bought on Amazon) LG would not fix it because of this. After that device went out, I decided to pick up a mid ranged phone to use for a couple of months to put me over, that choice was the Google LG Nexus 5X which was a great phone in it's own right, though the build quality and camera of that device left something to be desired. So now was the time, I had to decide between the Galaxy S7 Edge, HTC 10, or LG G5, and ultimately I went with this LG G5 (RS988). Why did I make this decision? Here's a couple of reasons: Dual-Camera (Which is incredible), Removable Battery/SD Card, USB Type-C, US Warranty (S7 Edge Unlocked had no warranty), Infrared Port, and LG's new UI which is greatly improved over my previous LG G4. So first impressions, the device feels really nice in the hand. I don't know how to explain it but the size and weight just feel perfect. The Always-on display I originally thought was gimmicky but after using it, it is something that I can see being very useful in months to come. First let me start with the UI, I use the default UI that the LG G5 comes with, which is just known as "Home". I like it, there were tons of controversy over this when it was announced as it doesn't have an app drawer, however, there is a check box in the settings that allows you to bring it back, but I decided to leave it default as I wanted to see it LG's way and you know what? It isn't that bad. I've owned 4 Android phones prior to this phone (Galaxy Nexus, LG G3, LG G4, Nexus 5X) so losing the app drawer felt weird, but only for a half day. According to LG Market research that they have done, it shows people rarely go into the app drawer and I can kind of see it that way. I feel like now I'm accessing apps a lot faster and that's because I've logically placed everything on the home screen in the order I want it to be in. You can still create folders and drop apps inside so you can still keep everything organized. I leave the Settings and Google Play store on the main screen as those are the two most important things I use and I can get to it right away. I put my other most used apps on the second and third screen and on the fourth screen I put my folders and least used apps. But I applaud LG for heading in a different direction the UI feels close to stock, it looks a little different visually but what I like is LG didn't put a lot of bloatware on this device, they went the safe route and I like it. Day to day performance has been very snappy, it feels literally 3 times faster than my LG Google Nexus 5X and ironically, benchmarks show that the processor is around 3 times faster so it feels like a 2 or 3 generation leap over a phone that is less than a year old, very impressive. The battery life so far has been really good, better than my previous LG G4, and LG Nexus 5X. It's simple to remove the battery, just push a button that is in the bottom left hand corner of the phone and pull the module out and you can switch out the battery within 5 seconds. This phone has a lot of questions over the 2800MAH battery size, I'm not sure what LG does, but this thing feels super efficient. This might be associated with the somewhat aggressive auto brightness display, which always seems to dim the phone, just enough in the right lighting environments. The Camera UI is very clean it's very easy for beginners to go in and use it as everything is logically placed with just a handful of buttons. So we must talk about the start of the show: The dual camera. I cannot in words sum up how incredible the wide angled camera on this phone is (I've posted some sample shots). It captures so much more area, it feels like you're doing a panorama shot with one click, one of my sample pictures caught a part of my finger as you can see, but the phone shoots so wide you would never expect that it could grab that much area, LG deserved a hats off for going this route and not trying to just make a great camera, but rather make an evolution of current camera phones. Next, I want to talk about the speakers on this device, this has got to be near the top of the class. The speakers are just super loud, crisp, and it feels like the range of the sound is very wide. My co-worker has a Galaxy S7 Edge and when we compared them, the speakers of the Galaxy S7 Edge is just tinny in comparison and definitely not as loud. Impressive considering that the speakers on the LG G5 are part of the detachable part of the phone or the module part of the phone. The LG G5 I am using is with AT&T in Orlando, FL and I am getting full 4G LTE Coverage here and the speeds are great. Better than both of my previous devices. As always as great as a device can be there are always some cons. The first con is that the Always-On display while fantastic is very Dim in bright sunlight. You can barely see it, it seems like a Always-On display does not adjust to the suns brightness and that it stays at one brightness level, or the brightness does go up but it's not enough to beat Florida's sunlight. This could also be associated with he fact that the Always-ON display is only in white. The second issue with this device, is this device suffers from some build quality issues. On the back of this phone, where the detachable battery area is, there's this weird type of bent metal look. I can't explain it, but the bottom part of the phone (Right before where the module connects) there is a weird bent look on the metal in three different areas(Maybe connectors for the module?). I know for sure this is from factory as the phone wasn't visibly damaged when I received it, but I'm not going to return it as it doesn't bother me that much and I've read about this issue at other places as well. Overall, I'm very happy with this phone. I always update my reviews, so when new updates/changes occur I'll be back to update and improve my review until than, I think this is a great device that has some minor issues that if you can look past, this is still one of the best phones out there you can buy - at any price. EDIT: 9-10 It's been over 3 months and I'm here to report that I have absolutely no regrets. The only complaint I can give is that it gets really hot sometimes when the GPS is being used, but this might be associated however with me using this case which I have no regrets buying: https://www.amazon.com/Design-Crystal-Bumper-Steel-Silver/dp/B01BCU8CQK/ref=cm_cr-mr-title There have been a couple of firmware updates since I bought the device, but nothing major. The last update improved the Battery Life a little more but the biggest difference was how smooth going through the screens are now, they've done a good job with the touch/sensitivity tuning for the G5. I'm also using Evo Launcher now, I really liked LG's Home Launcher but I feel like if I'm going to have an Android Device regardless of what device it is, I'm going to make it my own. Stay tuned for the next update in December when Nougat Drops for this device, I can't wait.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Want a long-battery lasting phone with great qualitys?. Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. I recently broke my LG G3 and had to use the iPhone 5 for a few months which was just a disaster. The battery died in less than an hour but I will admit I was constantly on my phone. I thought the G3 had a good battery, until I got my G5. Used it all night and went to bed with the phone on 40%. and it was on 39%! It wasn't until around 10 am. that it finally hit 15%! And let me just say, I AM ALWAYS ON MY PHONE. Charges in a little over an hour, but honestly you just need it to charge around 60-80% for a full days use. Now lets talk about that screen! Crystal clear and a big screen nearly the size of the iPhone 6 plus BUT it feels nice and comfortable in your hands. Lots of settings to help you navigate around the screen without reaching your thumb across or using two hands for those who have smaller hands. Fast phone when it comes to opening apps and using the internet. Great camera although a bit of a lag when first opened. All in all, I recommend this phone to anybody who wants a long lasting phone or I just recommend this phone overall!. LG G5 Unlocked Phone, 32 GB Titan (US Warranty). Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Works in Verizon but it is not as easy as "Plug-and-Play". Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. I've got the phone last night and it seems to be working fine. However, for those with Verizon Wireless network will have to do some extra work: this is what happened to me to get it to work. This morning I stopped by in a Verizon Store to have my SIM card from my existing Verizon phone to the LG G5 that I bought here. When they scanned the phone in their database, their database returned an error that they could not identify: they showed it to me their own system returned an error message and say nothing whether the phone could be used in the network. I was told that because this model IMEI (that is the phone ID) was not in the database, they could not install the new SIM card. I left very upset and once in the office, I logged in my verizon wireless account, I look for the option "Setup your BYOD" (bring your own device) and it asked me for the LG IMEI. After typing the number, the website tells me that my phone is compatible and can be used in the Verizon network. So, I printed the page and I went to another Verizon store. And again, same problem the phone would not show as compatible with the network. Of course they tried to sell me another phone but I refused and I said I would return it to Amazon. Then they gave me a Verizon nano-SIM card and they told me the before returning the phone to Amazon, I should try to call Verizon directly and see if they would activate the phone with card. And that's what I did, I installed that sim card and called Verizon. I gave them the IMEI number and they confirmed it is compatible, then they activated the phone remotely (and deactivated my old one). So, bottom line: it does work with Verizon but company makes it difficult to use BYOD phones. Still not clear why the verizon (official) store would not recognize the phone but calling verizon directly help. I think there is an option to activate the phone online and I think there are instruction in the website on how to get a new SIM card (if needed). Was this review helpful to you?.

By the end of the night i thought it was weird that my settings kept resetting. By the second day it started rebooting over and over again. Amazon was great about sending me a replacement immediately. This one has given me 0 issues. Pros: great battery life, quick charge time, beautiful screen. Cons: the screen is pretty big and requires two hands for some uses.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good phone, excellent price, one thing to be aware of.. The phone is exactly as expected (with one exception, see below), for a greatly cheaper price than when purchased from Verizon. If you want a phone that works on a number of networks, definitely consider purchasing here. The one exception is my own fault for not fully understanding what I was buying when purchasing an "unlocked phone." Specifically, the phone works on my network (Verizon), but doesn't have Verizon's modifications on it. This is certainly good in one way, no bloat-ware, but has one downside -- no Verizon Visual Voicemail app. Since Verizon isn't willing to supply the voicemail apk, and I'm not willing to go to an unknown source to download an apk, I was forced to have Verizon downgrade my voicemail service to work properly on my phone without the app.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Decieved. Unlocked phone arrived in Tmobile packaging and loaded with TMobile bloat where. No where was this in the product discription.

I'm not normally one to give bad reviews, but here we go. This phone has given me problems from the get go. The main camera is blurry and doesn't focus and the GPS doesn't work properly. Called LG customer service who said that I can send it in for repair, but that would take a week. And they wouldn't give me a replacement while it was getting repaired. Who can handle their business without a phone for a week? I will never get an LG phone ever again.

I have had the phone in for repairs 3 times so far so, each time taking more than a week and that's time that I do not have a replacement phone. Not a single time have I gotten the phone back fully repaired the first time. I'm about to send it back for the fourth repair. The reason I bought the phone was for the camera which hasn't worked properly almost the entire time I had the phone.

Battery is poor compared to the Motorola counterparts in the same price range.. I have had a few issues of wifi dropping, it might be an issue with LG phones.. Rated 4 out of. Wish it would get the Oreo update soon 7.0 is dated. Rated 4 out of. Love the phone and it's features only problem is that it over heats all the time. Rated 5 out of. Amazing phone! The best smartphone I've ever had!. It's sad to see the "collective wisdom" have failed so much with this amazing phone. Clearly LG is, as usual, ahead of times. I really can't believe how "professional reviewers" are so fixated on trying to find supposed issues on this phone, instead of realizing how great it is. The camera is great, the responsiveness is amazing, the updates with security patches keep coming (would be great to get Oreo, please don't forget about us G5 users!), the display is just amazing.... I could go on and on about how great this phone is. I was a bit annoyed that the G6 got rid of the disposable battery, IMHO it was one of the BEST features of this phone, and it's sad to see that LG had to bend to the "reviewers" that drove the G5 sales so low... Too bad really, that they seem to "review" just to favor some competitors' models (Too bad that I read the guidelines and I'm not able to point fingers to the other Korean manufacturer that seems responsible for those bad reviews.... Keep in mind, LG, that your ideas and implementations keep setting trends in the industry (knock on, buttons on the back, to names just two). Perhaps the only sub-flagship characteristic would be the battery life. It definitely could be better, but considering that you can replace the battery for another, full charged one, and that the whole process of removing the battery, inserting another one and powering up the phone takes no more than 45 seconds, and also considering that the spare battery costs less than a set of earbuds, I'd say it can be a moot point.. To sum it up: LG, congratulations on an excellent phone. I'm really sorry that the biased reviews didn't do justice to a great product, an amazing feat of engineering. I began to use your phones from the G2, and you have a completely loyal customer in me. Rated 5 out of. I have never been so satisfied with any phone like I am with the G5. I just can't understand how it can be so underrated in the "reviews" out there on the web. I fell in love with the LG brand since the G2 days, and this G5 is adequately continuing the tradition of excellence, performance and "out of the box" thinking that should have continued with the G6. I think it was too bad that the mass consumers believe what the "reviewers" say about the phone, affecting the sales of what is, in my opinion, one of the best phones out there, and the one that really should have set the evolution of mobile phones. I guess that LG had to switch back to a more traditional mindset with the G6 in order to achieve higher sales numbers. LG: Congratulations, on a job excellently done!. Rated 5 out of. I bought this phone last year it was the best Android I ever had I love the muti features and the speakers are so loud Good Job LG !. Rated 5 out of. I have had 2 lg g5s. One I have had for over a year..the other for about 6 months. I simply do not see why so many people have problems with this phone. I have only had one issue on the older one..the battery gave out and bulged against the back of the phone causing the nfc to not work..just put in a new battery and it worked again. I am an Uber driver and use this phone up to 13 hours a day with no problems. GPS and maps works great! No problems at all.. Rated 4 out of. I was weary about getting the G5, I have had the G4 and G3 previously and was very disappointed, the battery life was awefull. Well that all changed with the G5, it is really cool, battery life is excellent, and if need be you can very easily swap out the battery for a new one..

LG G5 is an Android smartphone developed by LG Electronics. It was announced during Mobile World Congress as the successor to the 2015 LG G4. [2] [3] [4] The G5 is distinguished from its predecessors by its aluminum chassis and a focus on modularity ; the lower housing which contains the battery can be slid from the bottom of the device, and replaced by alternative add-on modules that provide additional functions, such as a camera grip or a high-fidelity audio module with DAC. A lower-spec variation, dubbed the LG G5 SE , is sold in selected markets.. The G5 received mixed reviews; while the device's design was praised for its shift to a metal construction while maintaining the ability to remove its battery, the modular accessory system was panned for its limited use cases and inability to perform hot swapping. LG's software was also panned for the quality of its customizations.. The G5 is constructed with an aluminum unibody chassis; a "micro-dizing" process utilizing a plastic primer was used to conceal seams required for the antenna. [5] A rounded rectangular protrusion houses the camera components, and the bottom houses a USB-C connector. Unlike previous G models, the G5's volume buttons were re-located from the back of the device to its side bezel, but the circular power button—which now also contains a fingerprint reader —remains on the rear. The lower "chin" can be detached to remove or replace the battery, as well as install add-on modules to add additional functionality. The battery plugs into these modules, which is reinserted to replace the stock "chin". The G5 utilizes a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 system-on-chip accompanied by 4. GB of LPDDR4 RAM, and has 32. GB of internal storage expandable via micro SD card. [2] The G5 includes a 5.3-inch 1440p IPS display. [3] [4] The G5 features two rear-facing cameras; a 16-megapixel primary camera, as well as an 8-megapixel 135 degree wide-angle camera. As with the G4, the rear camera also provides color spectrum sensor and infrared autofocus features. A downgraded variation, LG G5 SE , is sold in selected markets such as Latin America and China. It utilizes a Snapdragon 652 system-on-chip (instead of Snapdragon 820) and only has 3. GB of LPDDR3 RAM (instead of 4 GB). The LG G5 is bundled with Android 6.0 "Marshmallow". Citing confusion between removing shortcuts to apps and uninstalling them entirely, the G5's home screen does not feature an "app drawer", and instead places all apps on pages of the main home screen similarly to iOS. [2] [4] The LG software includes an "always-on display" feature which persistently displays a clock and notifications on-screen when the device is in standby. [3] LG G5 does not support Android Marshmallow's "adopted storage" feature. In November 2016, LG began to deploy an upgrade to Android 7.0 "Nougat". The "Quick Cover" accessory was unveiled prior to the unveiling of the device itself; it is semi-translucent and features a window for the always-on portion of the screen. Touch inputs can be made through the cover and semi-translucent screen for actions such as accepting calls. A line of accessories for the G5 branded as "Friends" were unveiled alongside the phone itself, including a wired head-mounted display known as the LG 360 VR (which attaches via the device's USB-C port), the LG 360 Cam virtual reality camera, and the LG Rolling Bot. These accessories are all managed via the LG Friends Manager application on the device, which automatically pairs and synchronizes with these devices. [2] [12] The 360 VR is not compatible with the G5 SE model. [8] Two accessories utilizing the expansion slot system were unveiled; the "LG Cam Plus" accessory adds a grip to the rear of the device that incorporates physical camera controls, a jog wheel for zoom, as well as a supplemental battery. The "LG Hi-Fi Plus" accessory is a collaboration with Bang & Olufsen which adds a DAC , an amplifier, Direct Stream Digital audio support and upsampling, and is bundled with B&O Play H3 earbuds. LG stated that it would allow the co-development of third-party "Friends" to integrate with the G5. The LG G5's overall design was praised for its shift to a metal construction. [14] [15] The Next Web was critical of its design, arguing that the rear of the phone looked too "boring" because it was simply a rounded rectangle with a camera enclosure and power button that "protrude in an oddly wart-like manner" and a visible seam for the chin, and noting that the lack of curvature and its "hollow" feel made the design of the G5 "less premium" than that of the G4. [16] Techradar was also mixed on LG's decision to re-locate the volume keys back to the bezel but maintain the rear-mounted power button as a fingerprint reader, noting that front and side-mounted fingerprint readers were easier to use—especially if the device is sitting flat. [14] Due to its use of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 system-on-chip, the G5's specifications were considered to be more competitive in comparison to other flagships, unlike the G4, which used a model with reduced core count to avoid the overheating issues of the Snapdragon 810. [14] Techradar felt that the G5's performance was on par with the Snapdragon 820-based version of the Samsung Galaxy S7 sold in the United States, and that "in day-to-day use, and when not directly compared to its rivals' performance in a lab, it feels super slick." [14]. The modular accessory system received mixed reviews due to the limited number of modules designed for it, as well as the inability to hot swap modules due to the design of the system, which requires the removal of the battery. [14] [15] The accessories themselves also received mixed reviews; Techradar felt that the Cam Plus and the Hi-Fi Plus were too expensive to justify their price and effects on the device's size, but that it was "satisfying to set autofocus by half shutter key" with the Cam Plus. [14] However, The Next Web praised the design for "solving" the historic exclusion of user-replaceable batteries from metal phones, noting that "at least having the option for customizability is pretty awesome, not to mention replacing your battery after its capacity drops in a year or two. That's something no other metal smartphone can claim." [16]. The display was praised for its brightness, although The Next Web felt that the G5's color temperature was too cold, producing a "distractingly blue-green hue" that was exacerbated by the prominent use of white in its user interface. [15] [16] The software of the G5 also received mixed reviews, with particular criticism directed to the removal of the app drawer from LG's default home screen. The always-on display on the G5 was praised for being more useful than that of the Galaxy S7 due to its support for displaying all notifications, and not just specific types. [14] [15] The Next Web lamented LG's removal of the Dual Window feature—albeit believing the removal may have been due to the inclusion of native dual window functionality on Android Nougat , and that LG's customizations were "all around less useful than Samsung's". ^ "LG G5 Now Official: Removable Battery, INSANE Specs & Awesome, Modular Design". ^ a b c d e f "LG's G5 is a radical reinvention of the flagship Android smartphone".

The LG G5 is the followup to the G4. Announced at MWC 2016, the 5.5-inch G5 is a powerhouse offering from LG that features not one — but two — rear cameras, a removable battery, expandable storage and is running Android 6.0 Marshmallow.. Breaking from its design scheme of the last few years, LG is going with a more traditional side button placement on the G5, rather than the back-mounted volume buttons we’ve almost gotten used to. The G5 also had various modular attachments that work by actually removing the lower portion of the phone.. The G5 has departed from the plastic design of the G4 and opted for more metal all around. The G5 is a great looking phone, but the modular form might be a bit for some to get used to. Gone are the back volume buttons from the G4, and they’ve been moved to the more user-frendly side of the phone, however the power button and fingerprint reader still remain on the rear.. Powering the G5 is a Snapdragon 820 processor accompanied by 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The microSD slot allows for expandable storage of up to 2 terabytes as well. A 2,800mAh battery keeps it all ticking away.. Cameras are a big thing on the G5, with an 8MP front facer, as well as two rear cameras. There’s a single 16MP camera for standard shooting, and an 8-megapixel wide-angle (135-degree) camera, backed up by LG’s laser autofocus magic for focusing in the dark.. The modular slot on the bottom of the G5 has a release button to allow for new accessories to be swapped out. You can add in modules that include a camera grip with additional battery or an auto accessory that outputs 32-bit sound.. The G5 is available in Silver, Titan, Gold and Pink.. 5.3-inch IPS quad-HD quantum display (2560x1440, 554 dpi). 32GB UFS ROM, microSD up to 2TB. 16MP main, 8MP wide-angle (135 degrees). LG Cam Plus (camera grip with 1100 mph) LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&O Play. Wifi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac USB Type C, NFC, Bluetooth 4.2. The LG G5 is running Android 6.0 Marshmallow, with a layer of LG on top. It’s fairly standard Marshmallow, but there are a few things that LG chose to make their own. One of the biggest changes is that there is no app drawer on the stock launcher. LG opts for all of your app icons to reside on the home screen and in folders, saying it helps to prevent user confusion over apps. It’s definitely an interesting take (yet LG isn’t alone) but you can certainly always choose a third-party launcher if you’re not cool with it.. Here we shouldn’t just say “camera”, but rather “cameras” — of which the LG G5 has three. The front-facing camera is a standard 8MP one, while the rear houses two separate lenses. One is a 16MP camera for standard on-the-go shooting, and the other is an 8-megapixel wide-angle (135-degree) camera for, well, wide-angle shooting.. The camera itself performs on-par (or even better in some cases) than the G4 and V10 cameras. There’s a manual shooting mode with RAW support, and LG has some fun camera software that makes shooting and editing a breeze.. LG G5 Launch Event: Everything you need to know!.

LG UX 5.0 on Android Marshmallow. LG G5 – Design and Modules. There was lot of hype surrounding LG’s modular G5, but it didn’t last all that long. This wasn’t the best phone around, and the modular gimmick was ditched for the G6.. LG also probably didn’t count on other brand’s upping their game. The Samsung Galaxy S7 is fantastic, as is the HTC 10 , and there’s even budget offerings like the OnePlus 3 .. The lack of interesting modules has really hurt the LG G5, and it’s no longer the only modular phone on the market. Moto has the Moto Z and it’s already got a better selection of add-ons. There’s also the LG V20 coming soon, and it’ll be the first phone to run Android Nougat. Metal body, removable battery, modular system, rear fingerprint sensor, sloped top, 159g. In pictures the LG G5 looks curvy and sleek, but pick up the smartphone and it feels oddly hollow.. LG played up its switch from the plastic body of the LG G4 to a metal one on the G5. However, in the hand the G5 really doesn’t feel like any other metal phone I’ve come across. the handset has an odd finish that feels much more like plastic than the advertised “microdized” metal. I do like the slightly sloping top, though, but it’s the only feature that sets it apart.. Related: LG G5 vs Samsung Galaxy S7. The G5’s design is very clean too, with only a single volume clicker and SIM-tray present on either side. The volume control suffers from having a very shallow push, but it’s usable nonetheless. While LG has ditched the volume keys on the rear, the lock switch remains in the slightly unorthodox position just below the camera sensors.. In my opinion it’s far better to have all the buttons in the same spot, be it on the back or sides of a phone. Positioned as they are, I’m forced to move my hands around the G5 more than normal just to reach everything.. Related: LG G5 vs LG G4. The standby switch now also houses a fingerprint scanner – something I consider a must for any 2016 flagship. V10 aside, for which there’s been no UK launch, this is the first phone from LG to use a fingerprint scanner.. I’m pleased to report that it does a superb job – it’s fast and accurate. In addition, you don’t even have to press down to unlock the phone; simply glide your digit across and it’ll bypass the lockscreen completely.. As with all back-mounted scanners I’ve tried, it can sometimes go off randomly in my pocket. On more than a few occasions I’d pull it out of my pocket to be met with a message reporting “too many incorrect attempts, fingerprint blocked”. But I guess this is a side-effect of it being so sensitive. The scanner itself is also quite small, which might be issue if you have large fingers..

Now, it isn’t quite at Google Project Ara levels of customisability – so you won’t be switching out the RAM or CPU – but it’s clever and unique nevertheless.. Along the side of the handset there sits an almost indistinguishable button set just almost flush to the body. Press this in with the tip of your nail and the bottom chin of the phone will pop out; pull it off and out comes the battery.. The battery comes apart from the bottom unit – which can feel like you’re breaking the device – and then you can attach it to other modules, or “Friends” as LG calls them. At launch, there are two modules available and neither are going to be a draw in themselves to sell the phone.. The camera grip adds a touch more battery, a separate shutter button for both photos and video, and a jog dial for zoom. The second module is a DAC powered by some B&O tech. The DAC gives you 32-bit audio and an extra headphone jack.. Related: 5 modules for the LG G5 we’d love to see. I find myself wishing that LG had started off with slightly more enticing accessories. The DAC is a nice idea – I’m all for ways to improve smartphone audio – but the camera grip doesn’t actually make the camera any better; it just makes the shooting process “easier”. I also don’t like the fact it encourages people to use digital zoom – photo tech that universally produces terrible photos on all the smartphones I’ve tested, including the G5.. These two modules are also much pricier than I’d anticipated. The B&O DAC costs £150, while the camera grip will set you back £79. Problems will also likely arise when you’re ready to upgrade to the LG G6 – will the new device support the same modules? I’m not convinced.. LG is encouraging third parties to make their own Friends, so hopefully they’ll be a few more to choose from in the coming months. However, if the LG G5 fails to sell in large enough numbers then maybe there won’t be much incentive to build a costly module.. The modular system also hampers the build quality of the device. Both parts of the phone don’t quite fit flush together; there’s an ever-so-slight gap between the two. It’s minimal, but wide enough that I can see light filtering through.. 5.3-inch, IPS LCD, quad-HD display with always-on mode. LG’s past few flagship devices have benefited from impressive displays.. While they can’t be described as perfect, they’ve always adopted new tech and utilised it well. LG was one of the first manufacturers to really bring quad-HD, 2,560 x 1,440 panels to the mainstream, for example, and since the G3 it has gone from strength to strength.. I’m happy to say that the display on the LG G5 is the best yet – even though on the surface it appears that not a whole lot has changed.. LG hasn’t made the switch to a 4K display; it remains quad-HD. Although in my opinion this isn’t a bad thing – quad-HD is the highest resolution a phone needs to be unless it will be used for VR. The display on the G5 remains a IPS LCD panel too, rather than the AMOLED panels favoured by Samsung and Google.. The biggest change here is that the screen is actually marginally smaller than before – 5.3-inches as opposed to 5.5-inches. But the number of pixels remain the same; they’re simply crammed into a smaller surface area.. The display is ridiculously sharp, far more true-to-life and softer than the Galaxy S7 display. This isn’t necessarily a positive, though – it’s all down to personal taste, with some preferring accurate colours over vibrancy. LG has also improved the brightness of the screen, not that the G4 suffered much in this area. At its highest, it’s at 900 nits, but there will be few instances in which it will need to be set so high. Around 50% is right, or you can opt for auto-brightness.. I’m not a fan of auto-brightness on Android devices, and it’s no different here. It’s too obvious, results in a stuttering motion and is rarely accurate in its judgements.. The G5 display’s black level – an area in which many IPS displays struggle – is solid. While not as deep as those on the Samsung Galaxy S7, blacks on the LG G5 are suitably inky and deep, and mean the display has a great contrast ratio.. Just like the Samsung Galaxy S7, the LG G5 has an “always-on” display mode, so the time and your notifications remain visible even when the phone is locked.. LG’s implementation is much better than that of Samsung in just about every way. It uses less battery, about 12% a day (8am to midnight) as opposed to the Galaxy S7’s 15%. The LG G5’s always-on screen also displays all your notifications, including those from WhatsApp and Gmail. This makes it far more useful than the S7, which pushes alerts from only a limited selection of apps.. The display on the G5 is less customisable, however, and since it isn’t AMOLED, it lights up every pixel rather than just the clock. This means it’s far more noticeable, and more distracting, in low light.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

Bringing modular to the mainstream. by Nirave Gondhia April 8, 2016. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. - dual window removed from software. The G5 is a step in a new direction for LG and brings a brand new design, dual cameras, and modular capabilities while still staying true to what an LG phone should be. With the new modular concept, itâs not just about what the G5 can do now but rather, what itâs capable of doing in the future, and that alone makes the LG G5 one very compelling smartphone.. On the bottom, LG has made the switch to the newer USB Type-C standard , which is widely becoming the norm for flagship devices this year. Alongside this is the microphone and single bottom-firing speaker, and the latter is surprisingly impressive for a single mono speaker. Lanh sums it up best when he saysÂ. it is one of the better single speakers he’sÂ. heard on a smartphone in a long while.. From buttery smooth animations, to rapid multitasking and gaming like a pro, the G5 is definitely more than capable at handling whatever you throw at it. Aside from occasionally getting slightly warm (which is not a criticism), the G5 proves to be a very capable contender and offers an experience that rivals the best on the market.Â. In fact, both Lanh and I agree that it’s probably one of the smoothest smartphones that LG has ever put out.. Storage 32GB storage, with microSD for expansion. Camera Main cam: Standard lens 16MP with OIS, wide-angle 8MP. USB Type C, NFC, Bluetooth 4.2. Battery 2800mAh with quick charging via Type-C USB. Software Android 6.0 Marshmallow with LG UI. Dimensions 149.4 x 73.9 x 7.7mm. Colors Pink, Gold, Titan (Charcoal) and Silver. Modules LG Cam Plus & LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&O Play. The modular capabilities make the G5 one of the most unique smartphones on the market, and while other manufacturers are focusing on making a good smartphone, LG has shown it isnât afraid to dare to be different. As a result, the Korean OEM has a smartphone that truly stands out inÂ. and this can only be a good thing for LG and for consumers.. Despite switching to an entirely new design and working with new materials, LG still stuck to its guns and delivered a metal unibody, complete with microSD card expansion and a removable battery. In doing so, the company has shown that it values the core features that its users love and will continue to offer them.Â. Thereâs no denying that the overall experience isnât quite as refined as a second-generation product like the Galaxy S7, but what is really intriguing about the LG G5 is that it will continue to evolve as a smartphone experience. With the new modular concept, itâs not just about what the G5 can do now but rather, what itâs capable of doing in the future, and that alone makes the LG G5 one very compelling smartphone.. After a few years of tweaking and perfecting its G-series design language, LG has torn up the rule book and breathed new life into the line with the LG G5. Dropping a plastic build for a metal frame and introducing a new modular concept, the LG G5 certainly has the potential to shake up the mobile market, but does it succeed?. Unlike Korean rival Samsung who dropped microSD card expansion and a removable battery when it made the switch to metal and glass last year â although the former did return in this yearâs Galaxy S7 family â LG has stuck to its guns and, through a unique design, kept the removable battery and expansion while making the switch to a more premium build.. Are modules the way forward for the smartphone industry; will LGâs big gamble on being unique pay off; and can the LG G5 pose a real threat to Samsungâs excellent Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge smartphones? This is what we aim to find out â and more – in this full review of the LG G5.. As introduced earlier this year, this review follows our new dual review format with two different members of Android Authority reviewing the LG G5 to provide the most comprehensive review possible. While I have put together the in-depth written review youâll find below, the video embedded above was put together by Lanh Nguyen. Through the course of meetings to discuss our findings, together they combine to provide the most comprehensive review of the LG G5 experienceÂ. The LG G5 is the successor to last yearâs G4 but as Lanh says, “ itâs really nothing like it. For the most part, itâs an entirely different phone, and a lot of that has to do with the design .â. The differences between the LG G5 and the LG G4 are quite stark, with LGâs latest flagship bringing an aluminium build, but as weâve heard recently , itâs not metal as you quite know it. Letâs clear up on thing first; the LG G5 is definitely made of metal , but itâs undergone a secret treatment process which essentially puts a layer of primer and paint on top of the body, similar to how a car gets painted.Â. As a result, you arenât directly touching metal, but itâs definitely a metal phone.. With most metal phones, they can feel quite cold in the morning or warm under heavy usage, but for the most part, the LG G5 is a constant temperature. LGâs approach to metal was certainly done with the best intentions in mind but as a result of the primer-paint approach, the handset doesnât feel as premium or as solid as a metal phone traditionally does. Iâd have to agree with Lanh, when he says that:. Itâs kind of like having a metal phone inside of a protective case and itâs just something you have to wrap your head around when holding the G5. Materials aside, the rest of of the G5 is built well and the reduction in screen size over last yearâs LG G4 means itâs more ergonomically friendly and comfortable to hold in the hand. I personally think the 5.3-inch form factor is perfect for a smartphone and LG may have uncovered the perfect size. At 159 grams, the LG G5 also has considerable weight to it, but given the lack of premium feel to the body, the hefty weight actually improves the in-hand experience and makes the smartphone feel more solid.. If youâve used an LG G-series smartphone before, the button layout on the LG G5 will take some getting used to; since the G2 , LGâs flagships have had the volume and power keys on the rear, but with the G5, the volume buttons have now switched to the left of the handset. If youâre someone who holds a phone in their right hand, the position of the volume keys on the left is quite uncomfortable, and, as theyâre almost flush with the edge of the phone, they are difficult to locate at the best of times.. LG G5 power button vs the V10. The rear still sports a power button – with embedded fingerprint sensor â and the power button itself is a disappointment, as it feels uneven and doesnât offer reassuring feedback when pressed. Having used the power key with fingerprint sensor on the back of the LG V10 , the less-than-premium power key on the G5 is definitely a let down.. One of the better single speakers on a smartphone in a long while. Overall, the LG G5 definitely isnât going to win any awards for the way it looks but this smartphone is more about substance over style. LG has managed to combine microSD card expansion and a removable battery while keeping a metal unibody, and the presence of a recessed button to remove the bottom chin allows you to swap and remove batteries with ease. The bottom chin is also one of the most compelling reasons to buy the LG G5, as it makes the G5 the first modular smartphone to hit the market, and this is what makes the phoneâs experience so compelling.. Alongside the G5, LG is announcing new âFriendsâ that work with the smartphone; while some of these actually connect to the device, others donât and this is why LG kept to the Friends name (instead of calling them modules).. LG has developed a few friends for its new flagship, but is also opening the concept and allowing third parties to get creative with module designs. Of the modules that actually connect to the smartphone, thereâs only two available and these are the LG Cam Plus and the LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&O Play.. The LG Cam Plus is the companyâs camera grip, which provides welcome physical controls for launching the camera, taking a photo, video, zooming in and out of an image and recording video. The Cam Plus also packs an additional 1,200mAh battery, which can keep your phone topped upÂ. â when the phone is not being used that is â and the only real downside is the bulk it adds to the G5, which makes it uncomfortable to use as an actual phone.. Personally, I also think itâs very counter-intuitive that LG created a separate switch to launch the camera, rather than allow you to launch the camera by pressing the shutter button, but this is just a personal gripe with the design. For most people, once you realise the switch allows you to quickly launch the camera, you’ll find this is what you instinctively reach for when you pull the G5 and Cam Plus out of your pocket.. The LG Hi-Fi Plus is an entirely different type of module as it appeals very much to audiophiles and music lovers. Developed in partnership with Bang & Olufsen, the Hi-Fi Plus is a 32-bit DAC and headphone amp, which features an ES9028C2M + Sabre9602 chipset for supporting music up to 384KHz.Â. The DAC features its own headphone jack (in addition to the regular one at the top of the phone), its own speaker and the USB Type-C charging port and can also be used as a standalone DAC when not being used with the G5. The 24-bit audio experience on the LG G5 is already quite impressive, and the Hi-Fi Plus serves to improve this further, offering additional space, clarity and detail to the sound.. Before you get too excited about the Hi-Fi DAC though, itâs not going to work with G5 smartphones sold in Korea, Canada, Puerto Rico or the USA; LG declined to comment on why it wonât work with these devices (and why listings were pulled in the US), but itâs worth keeping this in mind if you planned to buy the G5 in one of these markets and wanted to buy the Hi-Fi Plus.. LGâs other friends for the G5 include a tethered Virtual Reality headset â which is lightweight and comfortable as it connects to your smartphone using the USB Type-C port â and the Cam 360. LGâs first foray into 360Â° cameras has delivered a stylish friend with two 180Â° cameras capable of capturing 16MP 360Â° photos or 360Â° video in Quad HD (2K) resolution.. Overall, the concept of a modular smartphone certainly isnât new â Project Ara anyone? â but LG has made considerable attempts to develop modules that are genuinely useful to customers. The availability may be scarce but with third parties also able to develop friends for LGâs new smartphone, it wonât be long before the available range is considerably larger.. As mentioned above, LG has made the G5âs display smaller than previous years, but kept the same QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) resolution as the G4. As a result, the display offers a slightly sharper experience (no doubt thanks to the increase in pixel density from the smaller display). Overall, the display is typical of that found on LGâs devices and, despite the smaller size, itâs more than large enough to offer an enjoyable experience when watching movies or playing games.. 2016 seems to be a race for OEMs to create Always On displays and LG is no different, evolving the second screen concept from the V10 into a more mainstream always on screen on the G5. As seems to be the way with most smartphones, the always on display isnât necessarily the most useful as it can show you the clock, incoming notifications (albeit quite badly), a signature or a random message.. Always On Display – Galaxy S7 vs LG G5. LGâs decision to go with LCD technology over AMOLED does affect the always on display as itâs quite dim and completely illegible in bright sunlight. No doubt, LG has had to tone down the brightness in order to help conserve battery life, but it does mean the Always On display is less useful than it could have been, had LG opted for a different display technology.. Overall, the G5âs display is certainly impressive and offers great color reproduction and vibrant colors, that arenât oversaturated. Yes, itâs not an AMOLED display so colors donât pop quite as much as they do on other devices but overall, itâs difficult to fault what is, otherwise, a more than capable smartphone screen.. As LGâs first flagship of the year, itâs safe to expect the latest and greatest specs and LG certainly hasnât disappointed in this department. Inside the G5, itâs got the Snapdragon 820, Adreno 530 GPU and 4GB RAM, which combine to offer a really snappy experience, with no visible signs of lag anywhere in the UX.. Probably one of the smoothest smartphones that LG has ever put out. Of course, the in-hand experience is only one part of it, so how does the G5âs SoC setup stack up to other devices, in particular this yearâs flagship Galaxy S7 family? Letâs take a look:. Starting with GeekBench 3, the LG G5 scores a very respectable single core score of 2252 and a multi core score of 5215. How does this fare to the competition? Well, this is slightly lower than both the Snapdragon powered version of the Galaxy S7Â. which achieved scores of 2318 and 5452, andÂ. the Exynos powered Galaxy S7 Edge, which achieved scores of 2107 and 6397.. Moving onto another CPU test and this time, AnTuTu reveals some quite interesting results, with the G5 ranking higher than the Galaxy S7 Edge which achieved a maximum score of 127938 in our testing. Despite only being a quad-core unit (comprised of two dual core processors), the Snapdragon 820 is proving to be one of the most capable chipsets on the market.. Our final benchmark took us to 3DMark to run the SlingShot test on the Adreno 530 GPU inside the LG G5. In this test, the G5 achieves a score of 2447, which is slightly lower than the 2528 score achieved by the Snapdragon-powered Galaxy S7 , but miles ahead of almost every smartphone currently on the market.. From benchmarks to the rest of the hardware and thereâs no denying that LG has managed to include everything you could ask for in a smartphone.. The fingerprint sensor is embedded within the rear power button and while the button doesnât feel as premium as on past LG devices, the fingerprint sensor is one of the best on a smartphone. Inspired by the Nexus 5X , it requires 5 to 6 taps to set up and unlike other smartphones, you donât actually have to press the power button in order for it to read your fingerprint. Just tapping your finger on the sensor is enough to unlock and it does so, quickly and accurately. On a couple of occasions, Iâve had an error saying fingerprints canât be used (and to use my alternate security method), but this seems to be a local issue as Lanh (and several others) havenât experienced this.. Under the hood, the G5 comes equipped with 32GB internal storage, which can be expanded further by up to 200GB using a microSD card. LG definitely deserves credit for sticking to its guns about both microSD card expansion and a removable battery, and for LG loyalists who need expansion, the G5 definitely doesnât disappoint.. Connectivity-wise, the G5 also doesnât disappoint as it comes equipped with a selection of LTE bands (which depend on the model you buy) that can support Cat 9 speeds (450Mbps download, 50Mbps upload), Bluetooth 4.2, NFC, an infrared port and a selection of sensors to measure and track almost anything. The use of USB Type-C can be a pain if you already have a collection of microUSB accessories but, with the industry moving towards this next-generation standard, itâs nice to see that LG has managed to future proof its latest handset.. Itâs likely that some people may have been concerned with the G5âs single bottom firing speaker but we can safely say that thereâs nothing to worry about. While it doesnât offer the quality of dual stereo front facing speakers, the speaker is mighty impressive for a single firing speaker.. Overall, buying a flagship smartphone usually means you get flagship specs with it and the G5 doesnât disappoint in the performance & hardware stakes. Combining the very latest internals with an optimised software experience has allowed LG to deliver one of the smoothest smartphone experiences it has ever offered on a mobile device.. Of course, battery life is where many smartphones can stumble, but how does the removable battery inside the LG G5 stack up to the ever increasing demands of smartphone users?. While most flagships seem to sport 3000mAh batteries or larger, the cell inside the G5 is a smaller-yet-equally-capable 2800mAh battery. For the most part, the LG G5 is capable of getting you through a whole dayâs usage, although actual screen on time seems to range between 3 and 4 hours. By way of comparison, the 3000mAh unit inside the Galaxy S7 lasts an hour or so longer off a single charge but the G5 does have one standout feature that sets it apart from the competition.. Accessed via a recessed button that unclips the bottom chin, the removable battery is a particularly good feature to have on a modern flagship. In a market where companies are moving away from removable batteries, LG has shown it is possible to switch to a metal unibody and still allow users to remove and swap the battery. After all, the beauty of mobile phones is the ability to be free from a tethered cable, and if you have to keep charging your phone, is it truly mobile?. LG hasnât revealed when official spare/replacement batteries will be available so if you find yourself running out of juice, youâll be happy to know that Quick Charge 3.0 is also present on the G5. The G5 charges to full in 1 hour and 19 minutes and you can charge to 50 percent in just 27 minutes.. Overall the LG G5 battery life is certainly more than satisfactory for a flagship, but it does fall slightly behind other flagships, including both of LGâs flagships of last year. That being said, the ability to swap your battery out and go from empty to full in a heartbeat is the key feature that sets the G5 apart from the competition. As quick as quick charging can be, nothing quite beats being able to swap your battery out and go to full in under a minute.. Traditionally, LG has offered a single camera array in its flagship devices, but last yearâs LG V10 saw the company release a smartphone with two cameras on the front. Fast forward six months and the dual cameras have stuck around, although this time theyâre on the back.Â. The main, larger lens on the right is the 16MP sensor, which comes equipped with OIS and f/1.8 aperture which is likely to be used for most of your shots. The secondary, smaller lens on the left is an 8MP sensor with f/2.4 aperture and wide-angle 135Â° field of view.. Both Lanh and I agree that the wide angle camera is the best thing on the LG G5 as it is capable of capturing excellent wide photos and itâs immediately obvious just how much of a difference there is between the two lenses. Both of us also agree that itâs the mode youâll choose to you use more often than not as, even though the resolution is lower than the main lens, the pictures definitely tell a much larger story.. The camera UI hasnât changed much from the G4 or the V10, save for the addition of two icons at the top of the interface, which allow you to switch between the two lenses. Alternatively, as you zoom in and out of a scene, the G5 will automatically switch between the lenses and reflect which lens is being used in the viewfinder.. Like past devices, the G5 comes with a range of preset modes to use when capturing a scene, and for the budding photographer, thereâs an entire set of DSLR-like controls over settings such as white balance, ISO, and shutter speed. As the saying goes, if it isnât broken, why fix it and LG was right to stick with its already-impressive camera app instead of trying to reinvent the wheel.. Picture-wise, the G5 delivers sharp images with excellent amounts of detail and, like past devices, the camera is definitely one of the best in the business. The color reproduction is pleasing to the eye and there doesnât seem to be a lot of oversharpening. The camera does have a tendency to crush shadows in a lot of daytime shots, but using HDR mode quickly resolves this, and, thanks to the color spectrum sensor, you end up with very natural photos.. The G5 is also capable of really good bokeh in photos thanks to the f/1.8 aperture, which allows you to capture images at a shallow depth of field. As a result, you can take some fantastic macro and close up shots with the main lens. The secondary lens has a much larger f/2.4 aperture so you wonât be able to take quite as shallow images.. Low light performance is on par with most smartphones but it isnât the best on the market. The G5 has a tendency to overexpose the highlights and thereâs a noticeable amount of noise reduction, especially in shots captured at night. laser autofocus but this doesn’t really show in lowlight,Â. where the camera can take longer than you’d expect to focus on a particular subject.. Up front, the G5 has a single 8MP selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture, which is capable of capturing pretty good selfie images in day or night. Itâs not the best selfie camera on the market, but is more than capable of capturing those moments. The G5 also comes with a range of shooting modes, including multi-view, panorama, slo-mo and time-lapse.. All things considered, the camera on the LG G5 is more than adequate and at least on par with most current flagships. The experience is typical of LG devices of the past, and considering these were some of the best cameras of their time, weâre happy that LG stuck to its tried-and-tested setup.. Now to what is arguably the most contentious part of the G5 experience: the software, and specifically, LGâs new User Experience. Running atop Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, the new interface brings a heavily refined user experience, but lacks an app drawer. The new UX is radically different to past LG devices, but this is for the better, as the G5 sports what is probably the cleanest and least intrusive LG UI ever made.. Previous LG flagships had come with a lot of additional apps and features that proved to hinder the overall performance and detract from an otherwise-great experience. This year, LG has adopted the mantra that less is more and to great effect, with a decluttered and bloat-free experience delivering silky smooth transitions and excellent performance.. The entire interface appears to be well thought out and little tweaks like the white and light green colored accents in the notification shade and settings menu are nice little touches. By default, LG has kept the settings menu in 4 panels, but they have now included an option to revert back to a more traditional list view like stock Android. Like previous devices, LG has also made it really easy to customise the on screen navigation keys, as well as choose in which apps the on-screen keys are automatically hidden.. Many of LGâs features like the Smart Bulletin and Qslide apps are still present on the phone but theyâre not quite as in-your-face as before, with things like Smart Bulletin turned off by default and tucked away inside the settings menu. LG has removed the dual window option from the G5, which is somewhat disappointing, but as Lanh attested to in the video, this isÂ. possibly because Android N will gain the feature natively and hence it will come to the G5 at a later date.. The biggest change to the software experience however, is the app drawer, or the lack of it should we say. LG has removed the app drawer in its latest launcher and as a result, it feels a lot more like iOS than Android. LG isnât the first to go down the route of removing the app drawer, but if youâve never used an Android phone without an app drawer, you will find the experience quite jarring at first.. LG has made its Home 4.0 launcher available as a download in their SmartWorld application, and this brings back the app drawer (alongside LG’s homescreen management of old). I personally found the G5 experience to be excruciating without the app drawer, but installing Home 4.0 (or an alternative launcher of your choosing) definitely fixes this problem. Personally, I find the Home 4.0 launcher quite pleasant to use, but also recommend Nova launcher for power users.. Overall, the LG G5 definitely brings with it a vast amount of changes to the software experience, and â lack of app drawer aside â the changes deliver the best LG software experience ever released on a smartphone. Given that LGâs interface was often the root cause of many performance-related issues on past LG smartphones, itâs nice to see that LG has delivered a truly flagship user experience.. The LG G5 is set to cost $700 off contract in the USA, which is pretty typical for a flagship smartphone and the G5 is definitely on par with other flagships in the same price bracket.Â. The G5 is a step in a completely new direction for LG and offers a brand new design, impressive dual camera array and premium software experience. At the same time, LG hasnât quite perfected its design but for a first-generation product, the G5 has us extremely excited about whatâs to come.. A smartphone that truly stands out from an otherwise-homogenous industry.... With the new modular concept, itâs not just about what the G5 can do now but rather, what itâs capable of doing in the future, and that alone makes the LG G5 one very compelling smartphone.. What do you think of the LG G5 and are you planning to buy one? Is modular the way forward and has LG stolen a march on its key rivals by adopting a modular concept ahead of everyone else?

LG’s G5 is already worth your money, and it's only going to get better. While its competitors play the game, the LG G5’s modular design changes it.. While its competitors play the game, the LG G5’s modular design changes it.. While its competitors play the game, the LG G5’s modular design changes it.. Future potential has yet to be realized. An amazing camera that steals the show. Specs and losing the app drawer in Android 6.0. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. LG is facing a gigantic challenge in 2016. It’s launching directly against the Samsung Galaxy S7 , a phone that improves on an already excellent platform to become an incredibly accomplished smartphone. To combat Samsung and the omnipresent iPhone, LG has decided to innovate and rethink how we use smartphones.. It’s a phone that has a bottom and battery that detach, allowing you to clip in new modules that give the G5 special abilities, like a better camera or higher-quality sound. It’s a small change, but damn exciting because of what it represents and what it could mean for the future.. But is the world ready for camera-enhancing modules or clip-in high-performance audio DACs?. For the G5 to be a success, people need to see the potential of the modules, but they also have to love the phone. Outshining Samsung and Apple is a gargantuan task, and LG’s out of left field. Does the G5 have what it takes to make people buy it and dive into the world of modular smartphones?. Editor’s Note: We tested a pre-production model for several days to see how the G5 performs alone, and with the CamPlus module attached. We will update this review when we receive final versions of the phone and modules.. LG will tell you the G5’s appeal lies inside the ‘magic slot,’ the unofficial name for the phone’s modular port. It’s located at the base of the device, and always houses the battery, which attaches to the module of your choice. On the phone’s right-hand side is a small, flush-mounted button that requires a firm press to activate. It pops the lower section of the phone out, disconnects the battery, and allows the entire module to be removed.. The battery unclips with a firm, sideways tug, and is reattached to the new module, which is slid back into the phone. It’s neat, well designed, and sensibly made. It doesn’t just unclip and let everything clatter to the floor either. You need to make the effort to pull the module free. You need a firm hand to remove the battery the mounting points, and replacing the module requires a solid final push to secure it back in place. None of these steps will be completed by accident, so the G5 won’t disassemble if you happen to look at it strangely.. However, it all feels very alien. We’re used to treating our phones like delicate little flowers, and the G5 needs some rough treatment to swap the modules. The first few times you do it, you’re going to wonder if it’s about to break. Will it? No, certainly not if you follow the instructions. Unless you drop the phone, you’ll be fine.. The amount of work, thought, effort, and commitment that has gone into creating the G5 is astonishing.. The first time we swapped modules, we were so afraid we would break the phone, that we asked another colleague, who’d had practice to do it. It took a couple rounds of swapping modules to get comfortable with the harsh tugging and pulling, and even then, it felt decidedly wrong. We can’t really imagine your average Joe swapping modules, but tech geeks will love it.. We also wish there were an easier way to swap modules, or that it each module came with its own battery, so we didn’t have to yank the battery out every time. Alternatively, keeping the battery tucked away in the back would be nice, so that swapping modules doesn’t involve any battery swapping at all. Of course, that would annoy those who want a removable battery pack.. are two of the very best camera phones ever made, and LG hasn’t sacrificed any of that photographic prowess on the G5. The G5’s camera is absolutely fantastic, and we can’t stop taking pictures with it. The sensor is almost identical to the V10, with 16-megapixels and an f/1.8 aperture, plus laser autofocus and optical image stabilization. It also copies the V10’s dual-lens selfie cam trick, but here, the two sensors are on the back.. The first camera provides a regular view of the world, while the second gives an expanded 135-degree wide-angle view, providing ample opportunity for creativity. They’re used independently of each other, unless you activate a special pop-out mode, where the two viewpoints are meshed together to create weird hybrids. It’s a feature that won’t be used that often, but can produce fun collages, if you’re patient.. Using the wide-angle lens is addictive. It changes the camera view completely, and changes the way you think about framing, composition, and focal points. Get it right, and the results looks superb, especially when taking pictures of vistas and wide-open spaces. There is a slight fish-eye effect to the G5’s wide-angle pictures, but again, provided you put some thought into the final image, it’s not distracting.. LG has included its incredibly easy-to-use manual mode for the G5, where ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance can be adjusted. It’s the most user-friendly manual mode we’ve used, and it never feels like you’re going to make a terrible mess of things when fiddling around with the settings. You’ll find yourself using it to tweak pictures rather than setting it to auto, due to its simplicity.. Even using auto mode, it slowed the shutter speed down to a point where a tripod was needed to steady the shot and eliminate blur. Switching to manual mode compensated for the circumstances, but the picture wasn’t as good as it could have been. The software wasn’t final on the G5 we used, so we’ll update this review when we’ve used the complete version.. Zooming in on subjects is handled differently on the G5, utilizing both lenses for a fluid, more detail orientated digital zoom feature. It’s still no match for an optical zoom, and although it has a greater range than other digital zooms, the results are hardly worth the effort.. The 8-megapixel selfie camera also has a wider angle than other phones, such as the iPhone 6S Plus, and comes with an effective beauty mode for smoothing out skin tones. There’s also a fun multi-angle mode where the three lenses take a picture, which is then shown in a three-panel collage — great for showing a reaction selfie without spoiling the actual picture.. The G5’s camera is a complete pleasure to use; it’s a huge selling point for the phone. It’s fun and easy to learn, and because the results are usually beautiful, you’ll want to use it more often. The wide-angle lens differentiates the phone from the competition — and is an improvement over the G4 and V10 — even if the overall picture quality and general usage is essentially the same. It’d be harsh to say it’s not a worthy upgrade from either of those two phones, given the G5’s other features.. Given how well the G5’s camera performs, you’d almost wonder why you even need the CamPlus module. However, after using an early version of the CamPlus, we can honestly say that it enhances the G5’s camera, creating even more high-quality images. The main area in which the CamPlus shines is with its zoom feature.. The module isn’t very big, even though it holds an extra battery pack to keep your phone charged while you’re off being a shutterbug. There’s a dedicated photo button, a button for recording video, and a zoom wheel. When we zoomed in on a street sign from a full, long block away in NYC with the CamPlus, we could easily read the tiny street number on the sign and other details that were impossible to see with the human eye. We did the same thing with the standard zoom on the Galaxy S7 Edge. and iPhone 6S Plus , and the results with both phones were more grainy and the street sign’s letters were almost indistinguishable.. The CamPlus module sees things that other smartphone cameras can’t, and it’s truly impressive.. The CamPlus module sees things that other smartphone cameras can’t, and it’s truly impressive. If you took the G5 and the CamPlus on vacation, you wouldn’t need to pack any other camera to take great photos. The addition of the camera button and zoom wheel will also be useful when you’re taking pictures with gloves on in the winter. It eliminates the need to touch your phone’s screen to get the best picture possible, which makes your G5 feel more like a real camera.. We felt some occasional software hiccups when the zoom wheel just wouldn’t work, or the camera had a hard time focusing, but LG reminded us that it’s an early prototype of the CamPlus and that refinements will be made before launch.. The CamPlus’ $70 price tag may give you pause, but if you like to take photos and find yourself wishing for a better zoom on your phone, the CamPlus is for you. We do hope, however, that carriers and LG will offer deals on these modules to make them more accessible to the average user. We’ve yet to try the high-res audio module or the battery back module, but we’ll update as soon as we get them in.. Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow is under more of a disguise on the G5 than previous LG smartphones, primarily because of the controversial decision to get rid of the app tray. It’ll split opinion, mainly among Android enthusiasts who have been with the OS from the start. Its similarity to Apple’s iOS will also annoy some, but the real question is, did we miss the app drawer? Not really, no. All your apps are still there, but instead of tapping another button to find them, they’re spread across multiple home screens. Yes, I missed relegating only the most often used apps to the app drawer to place more emphasis on the wallpaper, but with careful sorting folders, it’s still possible to individualize the G5.. LG’s list of pre-installed apps isn’t that long, and includes the usual apps for email, contacts, and the weather, plus tools like a voice recorder, calculator, task manager, and handily, an FM radio. A selection of battery, storage, and memory saver tools are also onboard. There’s also the LG Friends app, which helps you connect the modules properly. That process is remarkably easy: Once the module is in, the phone detects it, and you tap on its name to connect in the app. The G5 is a fireball with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 and 4GB of RAM onboard, and we’re pleased to say it isn’t literally too hot to handle. Qualcomm’s new chip has banished the overheating woes that plagued the Snapdragon 810, and while the G5 gets warm to the touch when put under pressure, it’s never hot. Because the software on our review device isn’t final, we’ll hold off benchmarks for now, but playing Danmaku Unlimited in HD, on the insanely busy difficult mode didn’t result in any slowdown.. If the G5’s processor makes it an absolute beast, what about the battery? We’ll start with the positives. It’s completely replaceable, so if you carry a spare, it takes seconds to swap it out for a freshly charged one. Try that in any other major flagship phone in 2016. In fact, try it in any metal phone at all. It can’t be done, and it’s only possible on the G5 because of LG’s radical modular design.. It’s not incredibly long lasting, but it’s not really that different from the Galaxy S7 or iPhone 6S Plus.. Recharging will have to happen every other day, and potentially part way through it. If you hit the GPS for about two hours, take some photos, and generally use the phone for email, messages, and apps; the battery will give up at the end of the day. It’s not incredibly long lasting, but it’s not really that different from the Galaxy S7 or iPhone 6S Plus in that regard. At least with the G5, if you’ve got that second battery, it’s not the disaster the situation it may have been on another phone.. It also has QuickCharge 3.0, which is a step ahead of the Galaxy S7’s QuickCharge 2.0 standard. It juiced up quickly when we needed it to regain power fast. The absence of wireless charging will no doubt disappoint some of you, but that’s one of the things about metal – It doesn’t let signals penetrate so well.. Finally, we come to the G5’s understated design. It can’t stand up to the beauty of the iPhone or Galaxy S7 Edge. At first glance it looks boring, but it isn’t ugly. In time, we began to like its subtle design details.. There are curves in unexpected places — the top of the screen slopes back towards the chassis, for example — and there are no nasty sharp edges to make it awkward to hold. The metal is smooth and seamless. It doesn’t have any unsightly antenna bands, either, which is a true feat of engineering that not even Apple has accomplished.. If anything, the G5 is too understated, and doesn’t make much of an early impression. Live with it for a while, and you’ll be thankful for its well thought out design and shape.. LG should also be congratulated for making the modular system almost invisible on the G5. When you first look at the phone, you would never know the base slides out. There are no over-sized buttons, no silly arrows painted on the body, and no ugly breaks in the chassis. It’s all handled with maturity and style.. Although it’s not much smaller than the LG G4, the G5’s sleek shape makes it very compact. It’s barely bigger than the Galaxy S7 and weighs 159 grams. The display is 5.3 inches diagonal, smaller than the G4 and slightly bigger than the Galaxy S7, but it has the same 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution seen on LG’s top phones over the last few years. It performed without fault, as did the fingerprint sensor on the rear, although we really missed having the volume controls on the back of the G5. They’ve been moved to the side of the phone.. LG usually updates its phones at least once, but its record isn’t much better than that of Samsung or any other Android phone maker. It’s a shame, and we’d like to see phone makers take more initiative in getting Android updates out to users sooner. Because Android phones don’t get regular updates, they are vulnerable to hacking attacks , viruses, and generally less secure than the iPhone. And they don’t often get new software features. LG, and others, should work harder to fix this epic problem.. LG placed a one-year parts and labor warranty on the G5, so if there’s a problem, you’ll have to send it back to the company for repair.. It’s unknown how durable the modules will prove, or if swapping them over and over again will cause and problems. That’s something that will be determined over time. The G5 isn’t water resistant, either, which is one mark against it in the durability column when compared to the Galaxy S7. However, when it comes to drops and falls, metal trumps glass every time, so the G5 will likely win the drop tests.. The amount of work, thought, effort, and commitment that has gone into creating the G5 is astonishing. While other brands are accused of coasting along with endless rehashes of previously successful handsets, LG has come out with something that drives the smartphone game full speed ahead. It’s brave, exciting, and full of glorious potential.. However, at the moment, the potential of the modular phone isn’t fully realized. Without a packed playground full of modular pals to play with, the G5’s magic slot is a bit lonely. The only two modules that are out so far – the CamPlus and the high-res audio one. — aren’t hugely exciting, and only photography nuts and high-res audio fans will take the plunge and buy one at a $70 price.. So, should you buy the G5 as it stands right now? We think so. It is undoubtedly one of the finest flagship phones of 2016 to date, and you won’t be disappointed by it whether you buy into the modules or not. But if you’re deciding between G5 and Galaxy S7 Edge, right now, we’d opt for the Edge, especially because it supports the best smartphone accessory available to buy today — the Gear VR headset .. The LG G5 is a great buy, but isn’t our favorite Android phone yet.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

Rated 5 out of. At first I was put off on this phone because of all the bad press. The G5 is a great phone. It feels good in the hand perfect size for me. Great display, very little bloat Apps very clean screen. Miss the App drawer but will install Nova launcher on it anyway so that is not an issue. I love the swappable batter have two extra never hook the phone to the charger just swap batteries. Never have to worry about being low bat with an extra in my pocket. Much lighter than a battery bank do not even feel it in my pocket. I will never buy a carrier locked phone again so much less bloat on the unlocked versions. Plus updates are straight from LG not the carrier.. Rated 5 out of. Great QA, the best model to buy?. My model doesn't have any of the typical caveats that plague other LG G5's from the four major carrier brands in the US. There are no weird bumps on the back next to the camera or a gap near the LG Friends connection/battery removal portion near the bottom. Internal Storage: Read 429MB/s Write 174MB/s Antutu Score: 132719 IR Blaster is great, fingerprint scanner has yet to fail over 100+ scans and is typically < 1s to unlock. Overall I haven't experienced any lag at all. Wifi goes at the speed of my internet connection (115Mb/s) no problem, I'll try transferring a video and update this. Rated 5 out of. I have ordered two phones one for me and one for my son, two phones came without any reported issues: 1) No backlight bleeds and blooming. 2) Didn't have any app's freeze yet. 3) No Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connect issues. 6) Proximity sensor is working properly. 8) Fingerprint scanner is working properly. 10) Battery life is decent could be the new battery will see it in the couple of month. LG please let us Unlock Bootloader on US-RS988 model also! Overall this phone was a good buy.. Rated 5 out of. First off, this phone is actually really nice, especially coming from an S4.� My biggest concern was the slightly smaller than status quo battery but it's really not that big of a deal when you can just speed charge it.� I could nit pick because this phone isn't perfect but nothing is and the gist is that the pro's out way the cons.. As far as B&H go though, Five stars and no complaints at all.� I'm extremely happy with their customer service and they treated me right when I made a mistake and asked for them to fix it.� So no matter if you buy this phone or decide to go with something else, I highly recommend B&H photo.. Rated 4 out of. a nick has no name from. I've had this phone for a few months now and I am happy with my purchase. I was unable to connect to 4G LTE when I first got the phone, but it was caused by AT&T claiming that the phone does not support their LTE bands. The only way to get them to let me connect to their network was to jump through a bunch of hoops, so I ended up switching to T-Mobile. Since then, I have been pretty happy with the phone, but I am disappointed because this version of the phone does not currently support WiFi calling on the T-Mobile network. This is why I am giving it 4/5 stars instead of a full 5 stars. I am pleased with the display, even though it is a little smaller than the one on the LG G4. In my opinion, the best features of the phone are: Being able to swap out the battery for a fully charged spare Expandable Storage Fingerprint Sensor (way better than the long password I had set on my LG G4) Other than the lack of WiFi calling, I have had no issues with my phone. I do not regret purchasing the phone, but had I know about the lack of WiFi calling, I may have gone with the T-Mobile version instead and just disabled all of the bloatware.. Rated 4 out of. This is a great phone, especially for the price it now goes for. Great camera - I really like the wide-angle secondary lens. The battery is better than expected. I've read complaints about the battery life, but I never had trouble getting through the day with medium usage. Great value at around $300 USD. Updates come slower than they do for the carrier branded models. I expect it to be the other way around for an unlocked phone. They recently released Nougat 7.0 in May 2017. I would definitely buy again around the $300 USD mark.. Rated 1 out of. I have had this phone for two months the first few days were fine until I noticed I could not have video calling with Version due to the fact that Version only allows video calling with a Version Phone this was fine I could deal with this I was upset over it but decided I could live without it. Then today I dropped the phone on its face and the power button along with the fingerprint scanner stopped working, then I realized the SD/Sim Card tray has been stuck and unremovable for I don't know how long. I do not recommend buying from this website just get it from Version or whomever you want to have service with and always get an extended warranty.. Rated 4 out of. I purchased this phone to allow me to run a specific Android App with the NFC feature for my job. Otherwise I would have stayed with my Blackberry Leap. So the biggest challenge I have is moving away from the Blackberry Hub which combines your email, texts and voicemail all through one interface. Now I have to get used to opening a separate app for each.. But this is not the fault of the phone. The G5 phone itself seems to be well built, fast, responsive with a great screen and cameras. It is also a little lighter than my Leap and a decent purchase price so no specific complaints about the phone so far. Even the fingerprint scanner works pretty good..

We focus on camera features, performance, and image quality.. last year's G4 and is the first LG smartphone with a dual-camera setup. With an F1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization, the main 16MP module is very similar to the G4 in terms of specification. and provides a 78-degree angle of view which is in line with most current high-end smartphone cameras.. But here's where things get interesting: the second lens comes with an F2.4 aperture and 8MP sensor and captures a 135-degree super wide-angle image. In the camera app you can switch between lenses via a button, and when using the digital zoom the camera switches seamlessly between the two modules. As before, the autofocus is assisted by a laser that measures the subject distance.. There is also an optional camera grip that should make the G5 particularly appealing to mobile photographers. slots into the device from the bottom.

Just curious, seeing the abysmal panorama performance, angle-wise (no full swing, at best 180 degree): are there any third-party Android/in-camera applications available that can do better in this respect? (more horizontal angle, that is; ideally also combined with HDR, or, best, HDR-Art). NB: way too many digicam's have this restricted horizontal angle also, like Sony; others use disturbing clumsy 'patterns', forcing you to follow a certain (& narrow!) visual path; if not, error, please start again.... (the Casio TR & ZR series are a relaxed breeze in both respects; full 360 degree swings or more (landscape orientation; 180 degrees in portrait orientation), and it requires a very erratic hand to end up with an error) (but alas, even though these same Casio's excell in wide-angle, 21mm and recently 19mm, this G5 does heaps better, with 135 diagonal (= close to 10mm lens in 35mm-terms). Photoshop got incredible built in stitcher for at least 6 years. If you need it for free there is hugin (just google hugin panorama). And then you just need to take sequential pictures that cover what you want to capture. The only somewhat proper stitching is on the google camera app IMO.. Sorry, no matter how much I appreciate technical perfection (plus it being the only way to do HDR/HDR-Art panorama's (until now!)), there is nothing more satifisfying than seeing the panorama-results instantly, for also instant retries, adjustments & alternations. Even for the panorama-gifted/-talented, there is no way to truely predict the (catchy) 'visionary' effect of a good panorama, especially when using foreground & see-through elements. Add diagonal panorama's, and all bets are off...seeing is believing.. And this opinion by someone who adored not just analog panorama (with days between action & result at best) but also the maddening combination of inpredictability plus long turnaround times of Kodak HIE.. Only factor against in-camera is speed (but Casio Tryx/TR is also faster than ZR-series, oddly). But then again, in that same context, in particular combined with HDR, I have always considered this camera-speed specification as (split)seconds per frame, not frames per second.. FWIW, update: While sadly neither (in-camera) panorama nor HDR-Art I finally found my very first app that even uses the 3rd superwideangle at all: Open Camera.. Only downside is that I can't get the AEB to work in its maximum setting of 5x 3ev (=12ev total); only 3x 3ev (=6ev total).. Anyone seen any other app, using the third camera? (best would be an app forcing all other apps to see & use it, default or by choice!). Just got the phone in my hands but was quickly disappointed. I can't seem to find a setting that would let me choose full resolution when shooting raw, it's only approximately just half compared jpgs in auto mode. RAW: 2656x1494 (3,97Mpixels 16:9), file size 19,5Mb. Has anyone else noticed this issue? I hope that it's not a feature that cannot be changed. In that case I'll just return the phone.... Hard to believe but it seems that this is something of a user error! IrfanView, that I used for opening the dng images, opened them with half a resolution. Another software and the issue is gone.... Bottom line: Although the phone is pretty, has a very fast basic OS, and has a long battery life and lots of apps, it's held back by clumsy task switching, a terrible keyboard, lack of basic tools in the OS without a 3rd party app (attachments, file manager, zip support, etc.), memory and storage limitations, and proprietary Apple stuff, such as requiring my birth date and credit card number just to create an Apple ID, and having to depend on the Apple/iTunes for content and iCloud for storage. It's pretty much a consumer appliance and not really a tool for getting stuff done. LG G5 Dual H860 wholesale price in China : 299 $ <a href="http://www.saleholy.com/lg-g5-dual-h860-grey-p-955.html">wholesale LG G5 price in China</a>. Is it possible that a future update may improve the video quality on the G5? The review says that video isn't as good as in other flagships, but I was wondering whether this could be a software issue, rather than a hardware one. " proprietary Apple stuff, such as requiring my birth date and credit card number just to create an Apple ID, and having to depend on the Apple/iTunes for content and iCloud for storage. The camera is very good for shooting pictures, and is above average for shooting video. Here is a short film shot only with the LG G5. As you can see it does much better outside and inside.. Still waiting for the time when smartphones shoot full frame, RAW file, can trigger wirelessly off camera lights, able to capture shallow dOF and high ISO sensitivity.. there is One puls 3 has RAW capabilty. btw thats why there is someting called a DSLR. Caution with the back lens cover glass (or crystal or whatever it is). Mine broke, leaving a ragged hole over the wide-angle lens, while in my pocket. The normal camera still works, but the wide-angle is now prone to some nasty veiling flare on the right half of the image.. The local phone repair place tells me that their parts supplier tells them that all replacement lens covers in the US are sold out. I've been waiting for almost a month, and now it's going to be another week yet. Sounds like it might be a weak point in the G5.. It cost about $45 (USD), which seems to be about the standard charge for most mobile phone repairs. It took less than 10 minutes to do the actual repair, once they got the part.. In 3 days I get the LG 360 Friends Cam keep U posted.... nice LG G5 camera review and I love this lovely one. thanks for your nice judgement s. I buy it and make a lot photos .. I bought a G4 because the results from raw are good. JPEG on an LG is execrable so why post rrsults instead of just saying you have to use RAW. The other reason to buy is the panoramas but thry are hopeless as thry have thr same lowres blocky appearance the jpegs here have with added massive exposure shifts on any scene not being the same tone everywhere. It alters exposure as you pan instead of using a single consistent exposure. Is it possible that a future update may improve the video quality on the G5? The review says that video isn't as good as in other flagships, but I was wondering whether this could be a software issue, rather than a hardware one.. I don't have a G5 but I am planning on getting one, since it offers more for photography lovers than any other phone out there (overall).. Simply not true Video Qual very good the stabilisation is the best. Only in very low light its not so good - where I dont take pictures. Some Compression artifacts in pics jpg are there. Thanks! I just checked the clip. Video is quite good, and is as good as the S7, if not better. Still pictures, however, nothing is as good as the S7. Again, the presence of a wide-angle camera more than makes up for the difference in image quality... Mine will arrive tomorrow! I'm expecting its arrival to test it!. I am quite surprised by low quality rendering - water color quite often especially in greens. Having V10 and G4 I hardly ever got this level of smearing. I think LG with this model has gone Samsung route - quite heavily overprocessing the JPG. V10 renders - at least in comparable scenes - visibly more naturally - not to mention available full manual video mode.. The LG G5 jpeg engine is not great. Using the DNG RAW mode shows the potential of this phone. LG should include advanced JPEG options for compression and noise reduction and or improve the jpeg engine.. Would be really nice if reviews include 35mm-equivalent focal length and sensor size information shown in the spec list. My goddness the sound is so good with the B&O Module. If you are a photographer you will take pictures with what ever is available and you will be able to get better shots than the less experienced. The shots people get with phones never cease to amaze me. You must come to terms with the reality that the opportunity to criticize does not make one a critic. Non photographers (as you would) get meaningful things and have fun doing it. Where's the harm in that? Art, after all, is in the eye of the beholder.. Although there are undoubtedly some photographers who take pictures with their smarphones, smartphone "photographers" are generally not photographers at all, but merely consumers who take snapshots with their smartphones. Having the ability to hold a camera in your hand and press the shutter does not make one a "photographer" any more than drawing lines on a piece of paper makes one an "artist".. having the ability to post a comment does not make one a pundit any more than typing a sentence on a computer makes one a linguist.. I'd sure love to know what the phuck deriding people who can take photographs with ANYTHING WHATSOEVER has to do with this article...specifically.. Most people who own DSLRs aren't photographers, either.. I don't really see the point you're trying to make. No qualification makes someone "a photographer". Am I a photographer because "I'm really into it"? No. Is someone a photographer only if they're really good at it?. " No qualification makes someone "a photographer" " - yes there is, the qualification is someone who takes photographs.. Either way sort of proves my point. Either everyone who takes photos can be called a "photographer", or there really is no difference between "photographer" and "non-photographer" since there's no qualification or licence that you need to earn to be deemed as such. So yes, everyone who takes photos is a photographer. No qualification necessary, although some sort of camera is a requirement.. This comment is aging, but I could not resist.. I take pictures which makes me a photographer. I drive a car which makes me a driver. There are millions of very good photographers out there who are not holding kilograms of gear to make photographs. The tool does not make the craftsman. A true craftsman chooses and uses the tool to get the job done.. We have new tools now in the chest. They are not replacing the old ones anytime soon - and maybe never will. But there's no need to feel superior about "being a photographer" because you've invested in - and may even be good with - the traditional stuff.. Taking snapshots of the life or objects with photography enabled device it is called photography. Not everyone will make money out of it. That is called professional or commercial photography. So yes, everyone is photographer, we moved from Daguerreotype, photographic process employing an iodine-sensitized silvered plate and mercury vapor, in the studios, and 3 minute exposure from early 1800's until today when we equipped anyone to do it so with their telephones, instantaneously.. So, the main camera is good, but not great. The wide angle camera is fair, but not really good, but you really like the fact that it's there.. Considering just how bad the reviews for this smartphone overall have been everywhere, it doesn't seem as though these cameras are going to move the sales much. Very few people consider the camera as being more than one aspect of consideration, and rarely the biggest aspect.. Perhaps if this was a better phone overall.. Well, of course we focus our review on the camera and not on the other elements of the device...that said, what exactly is it that's so bad about the G5?. > Very few people consider the camera as being > more than one aspect of consideration. True, but that's only because no-one has done it right so far. And with current obsession with super-slim phones, I can't see it happening any time soon.. Panasonic DMC-CM10 was a step in the right direction, and LG G5 brought some interesting ideas, but both were/are lacking... Let's wait see what the future holds.. There *is* a market for camera phones. I mean, phones with cameras in them treated at least equally important to the main function. I'm one of potential purchasers since, even though I always carry Sony RX100m2 on my belt, I still find it less convenient than a *proper* camera phone would be under many circumstances.. I read lot of these LG G5 reviews. I think the implementation of the modular design and build quality could be better. However, I think the phone feels quite well made. Performance wise there is really nothing to complain about. The UI is fast and call quality is excellent. I chose this phone over other phones because of the dual camera and the modular feature. I posted test photos here: http://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/57725594. From what I've seen, all of the latest flagship phones got great reviews and bad reviews. I like my G5 just fine. Would I be happier with an S7 or an HTC 10? I doubt it. Are there people who'd be happier with one of those? I'm sure of it.. I don't know where "the main camera is good, but not great" comes from. As smartphone cameras go, it's top-tier. The only complaints the review had were in JPEG rendering, and you can shoot DNG and avoid all of that.. And the wide-angle is better than fair. It's absolutely not on a par with the main camera, but it's infinitely better than the wide-angle lens on any other smartphone out there (because there aren't any).. For me, the modular design was a "so what" feature. But I bought my G5 when the "free battery and charger" promo was running, and I've found it quite liberating to not worry about how much charge is left in my battery, because I've got a charged spare.. I'm not criticizing your concentration on the camera, it's to be expected. It's also been stated on the site that it's what you're going to do.. I'm just saying that I've not read a review of this phone, overall, despite what some other posters are saying here, that has been better than just ok.. Since your review of the camera itself is good, but not outstanding, the phone itself would need to be very good to compare with the best Android and iOS models, and it's not.. It seems that the LG G5 doesn't have a shutter prority mode (ISO adjusting automatically to any given speed). I find this omission to be quite irritating in a high end phone (at least, there are many times I wish my LG G4 had this feature). Is there any technical reason for that? Thanks, Tiano. You can do it with the Camera FV-5 app. But my experience has been that the five-stop adjustment range that ISO offers is too limiting. You really need to be able to vary the shutter speed as well in order to handle the wide range of scenes that the camera will encounter.. Give FV-5 a try on your G4 and see what you think.. It seems that very few phones offer this feature. In fact, as far as I know, the only phones that do (in the stock app) are; S4 zoom, K zoom, possibly CM1 - all these could be better described as cameras with phones bolted on the back!. Personally I never got on with FV-5 but as an alternative that also offers shutter priority mode you could try pro shot - this app has other nifty features such as controlling noise reduction, jpg compression, focus assist and many more. One of the complaints I had with manual mode on the LG V10 is shutter lag (not sure if the G5 suffers with this) but pro shot solves this - it's blazingly fast.. As you say, it offers shutter priority. It also has a brilliant user interface - much better than the one on the LG G4. But I´m not using it very much since it´s very unstable, has no HDR mode, it´s limited to 800 ISO and flash metering is hit - or - miss.. But again, it´s user interface and options are IMO so much better than any other high-end phone´s stock app that I wonder why big players like Samsung, Apple or LG aren´t making anything similar.. What are the chances LG will develop a dual shot feature? The 16mp lens isn't as wide but they could only use the center portion of the 12mp WA frame and average it into the 16mp file. If both shots are fired at the same time/SS it could be a way to reduce noise, even improve resolution.. Is this too much engineering for LG?. I bought the G5 specifically for the wide angle lens. Now I just can't go back...It is quite remarkable how much more you can fit in!. The LG G5 looks better in person than in photos. The wide angle lens is fun. Performance wise I agree the jpegs are over processed. The dng files look much better. I'm pretty excited about the possibilities of future modules. The Cam Plus is OK but not something I would use daily. I'm glad to see that DPReview is rolling smartphone reviews back into the regular website. LG is a reputable manufacterer and it's good to see a company that actually innovates. I'm not sure I'm convinced by the battery grip and dual camera setup, but on the other hand, at least LG is trying. Compare that Apple, which had the audacity to update the 2012 vintage iPhone 5 form factor into the "new" iPhone SE. At least LG is trying while Apple literally "phones it in" with the latest iPhone.. I just bought a G5 two weeks ago. Coming from a Note 3 and 4, i dont mind larger phones, which is why i will get the G5's battery grip. Not so much for photos as i don't use the camera that much, but for another 1200mAh of battery.. I held a demo of it and it will also be more comfortable to just hold the phone that way when im watching Netflix ect. IMO all phones should offer battery accessories.. Apple added back the 4" form factor because people keep asking for it. You can see on the Android side how many people ask for 4" phones with flagship hardware to get an idea.. Go to GSMArena to get iPhone SE's review. SE keeps up with all the latest phones and have better battery than all Android except Galaxy 7.. LG really screwed up with G5 and the sales number shows it. It is already the ugliest of flagships (especially after the beautiful V10) and the friend modules just make it uglier.. The camera is good, not as good processing as iPhone and Samsung and not as good hardware as HTC. I hope LG put something amazing in the V11. you're executing lg's master plan of profit exceedingly well. by creating an ugly product, people like you will comment about the beautiful V10 and buy that instead.. I believe that the flash is single-LED. Also, as far as I know the laser-focus is exclusive to the 16-Mpix main camera; the wide-angle camera uses conventional contrast-detect focusing.. A non-photographic correction to this statement: "An area of the display is always on, showing notifications, even when the device is in sleep mode.". Although widely reported that way, it's not "an area of the display". The full display is dimly lit, with only a small area actually showing anything. This is an option, so you can shut it off. And the dim backlighting automatically shuts off whenever the proximity detector is triggered, such as when the phone is in a pocket or purse, or lying face-down. So it doesn't use nearly as much power as it sounds.. Pentax (or one of unimportant market-players like Canon or Nikon) ;o))). a FF camera which can be used also as cell-phone. We have already everything in DSLRs which are small computers as cell phones are ... Is it so dificult to include bluetooth headset & some cell-phone functions too? :o)))))))))). "a FF camera which can be used also as cell-phone.". You mean with a data connection to a mobile network for uploading images, or are you seriously wanting to take calls on your Pentax K-1?. I was joking - but if I think this joke over once again, wouldn't it be nice to take phone calls also 4 ex. over K-1 conected with phones-net & only with head set .. Growing up, i had an alarm clock radio made by Goldstar. That was a great old radio, from the 60s. Who knew that one day, Lucky Goldstar (LG) would have one of the top camera phones out there....? They were mostly known for soap and toothpaste back in the day... I wonder where cell phone cams are in relation to flagship DSLRs? I would guess many surpass the Nikon D2HS, which came out in Feb 2005 at $3,500. But still quite a jump to the Nikon D3, at $5,000 in 2007--not nearly there yet.. Aren't smartphone camera reviews supposed to be on the Connect sister site? Has it been incorporated into DPReview?. That phone wouldn't fit in a pocket. If you out a grip that doubles the phone area, you should just use a real camera.. well, if you'd read the review you'd know that the grip is an optional accessory that can be as easily removed as it can be attached :). It's probably still no thicker than some of the first gen smartphones like the HTC EVO/Desire... I like the idea of a combo grip/battery/controls, extra battery could've been bigger tho.. You could literally take any smartphone on the market, double or even triple the thickness of it and it would still fit in your pocket unless you were wearing those ridiculous super skinny jeans.. People seem to forget things like the Nokia 5110 which was described as "diminutive" at the time of release.. Thank God this didn't take us to the white background website!. Now the phone page of dpr.. Connect as a separate URL has been retired, but mobile reviews and news will live on here.. That's great, I was never a fan of the dichotomy or the back and forth clicking... This will make the Connect content I care a about more visible (no offense to Lars).. Now if I could just get the light theme nag to go away on the main page....... Unless you're trying to mimic a gopro, then a telephoto seems a better option.. I'd say that totally depends on your requirements and style as a photographer. Independently it is, from an engineering point of view, easier to add a wide angle than a tele to a phone camera.. Nothing wrong with a wide-angle, but I think most of us would prefer a proper rectilinear ultrawide.. "Independently it is, from an engineering point of view, easier to add a wide angle than a tele to a phone camera.". Is it? Sure a real telephoto is going to extend rather, but we're talking tiny sensors and no actual need of a telephoto lens for the same angle of view as a telephoto.. Meanwhile, the gopro thing is covered. He's just saying that because he thinks it's true, but it's not.. 78 degree field of view? What's that.. I think most of us here understand 35mm equiv better. And we're just fine with ignoring the comment arguments for those with 'equiv' issues.. The two rear cameras are 16:9, so converting to a 3:2 35mm equiv is a bit of a challenge. By the way, the 78 degrees (and 135 degrees for the wide-angle) are measured diagonally.. If you look at the diagonal angle of view on a 3:2 aspect ratio, the rear cameras are approximately 27mm and 9 mm. But if you're going to crop your captures back to 3:2 or 4:3, you're going to get a tighter field of view than that.. When compared against a conventional 4:3 camera, the magnification of the main camera is more like a 34mm equiv than 27mm.. So....it's really not that complicated and dpreview could have given us the equiv 35mm anyway.. it's not complicated for spies like mr. bond, but you did ask the question. Well, it's more complicated than that, because "conventional" cameras aren't 4:3, they're wider. Full frame, as well as APS-C cameras, by far the greatest number of conventional cameras have a 3:2 ratio. Small point and shoot digital models tend to be 4:3 more often, but these cameras are dying out rapidly.. But when talking about 35mm equivalent, it's 3:2.. If you don't need the wide-angle, the main camera is the same as on the G4 .. same specs but definitely improved processing.. G5 might be the most ambitious product ever made by LG. Combination of good camera, great sound, fast processor, etc is good, only if these features come in one piece, instead of modules.. what food are you talking about?. ah, the Korean I assume...once in a while you've just had enough jamon, chorizo and all the other good Spanish stuff and something totally different is in order :). I was wondering whether to buy a G5 or a 5X. I'm not much of a technical person, so I need your help.. DxOMark Mobile Report added to our LG G5 review.

Rating 1 to 10, top score 10. Modular design innovative Fantastic camera set and software Exceptionally fast performance. look Poor display brightness Large display rim. The LG G5 has the performance to match the best of the best, along with a unique modular design and excellent rear camera. It's not as slick as other Android smartphones, but it should appeal to those that want something a little different.. LG changed its game plan with the G5, emphasizing design practicality and innovation over aesthetics and finishing touches. This is best represented in the LG G5’s Magic Slot that makes this a partially modular Android smartphone by expanding it functionality with external accessories. Compared with the HTC 10 , and new Samsung S7 handsets , the LG G5 smartphone is not the most attractive device. But that Magic Slot makes it one of the most interesting handsets on the market.. The LG G5 smartphone has a dated look, but modular design.. Thankfully, LG didn’t ditch everything from its previous G smartphones, including the G4’s excellent rear camera. The G5 actually has two of them: the same 16-megapixel camera we loved on the V10 model , along with a wide-angle 8-megapixel camera that’s just a notch below in terms of photo quality.. As if that weren’t enough, this device also sports the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset, 4GB of RAM, Android OS 6.0.1 (Marshmallow) and a replaceable 2800 mAh battery.. LG is betting that features and specs matter more than looks when it comes to the G5. But is it any good? Read this LG G5 review to find out.. We have never written this about the. G-series, but the LG G5 smartphone , at least a first glance, is bland. It has average dimensions and weight for a 5.3-inch phone (5.88 x 2.91 x 0.30 inches, 5.61 ounces), a metal unibody, and regular button placement (an unwelcome departure from the LG trademark of back-mounted buttons).. The LG G5 has a Gorilla Glass 4 front.. The G5’s front surface is covered with Gorilla Glass 4, from the top all the way down to the Magic Slot. The glass is slightly rounded near the upper side edges, which is unique only to the G5 (rounded glass on the edges is common and sometimes called “2.5D”). The curvature serves no purpose apart from aesthetic concerns. Although the relatively sharp front and side edges suggest multiple pieces, the entire body is crafted out of a single piece of metal (apart from the removable module, of course). This makes the LG G5 feel like a credible device. This is the only unibody smartphone with an interchangeable battery.. In addition to the LG logo on the removable module, the front side also includes the front camera, speaker, notification LEDs, and several sensors. The back side includes the dual rear camera, which protrudes from the back surface into a bump that also holds the LED flash and “laser” autofocus sensor (infrared to be precise). The fingerprint reader is situated under the camera, which doubles as the power button.. The phone’s lower side includes the USB-C slot, primary microphone and speaker perforations, while the upper houses the secondary microphone for ambient noise reduction, the 3.5mm audio jack, and infrared transmitter. The right side holds the nanoSIM and microSD card slot, while the volume control keys are situated on the left side. The Magic Slot release key also sits here, and it works immaculately. When pressed, the module pops out slightly, enabling the user to easily pull it off. Reattaching it only requires a simple press until it audibly clicks. The Magic Slot is just as well-built as the phone around it.. The LG G5 has a large camera bump.. A single USB Type-C input handles charging.. With its 5.3-inch IPS QHD display (1440 x 2560 pixels), the LG G5 smartphone has a high density of 554 pixels per inch. Image sharpness is exquisite and the contrast is praise worthy. Looking just at the pure black and white tones, the screen matches AMOLEDs found on other devices.. Too bad it has poor maximum brightness. Perhaps this is why LG included an “Assertive Display” algorithm intended for viewing the device in direct sunlight. It’s an adaptive display technology found on other devices with similar chipsets. It works well enough, and it keeps glare from overwhelming the G5 display.. We’ll praise the G5 for color interpretation. Colors are exceptionally well saturated and accurately interpreted, albeit with a slight emphasis on pastel tones. Most people will find this pleasant for everyday use, but those who prefer more intense color and surreal image quality will be disappointed that LG did not enable the option to manually adjust the color settings. That aside, the G5’s colors are some of the best on the market, if not the best.. Like the V10, the LG G5 has the Always On option. Unlike the V10, which uses its additional display panel, the G5 actively displays the time and date smack in the middle of the display when the phone is on stand-by. Just like the case was with previous iterations of the G series, a double tap awakens the phone.. The display isn’t entirely praiseworthy, though. The display bezel is very large and the G5 does not have physical Android keys to occupy the space (they are on-screen capacitive keys). This is the tradeoff for a modular design.. The LG G5 smartphone has Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 820 chipset with a quad-core Kyro processor (2 x 2.15 GHz and 2 x 1.6 GHz), Adreno 530 graphics and 4 GB of RAM. This combination offers exceptional fluidity during use and make it the fastest phone — or at least one of the three fastest phones — on the market, as of this writing. In testing, our LG G5 review unit. did not overheat with long use, even when playing graphically demanding games and video content, over both 4G and Wi-Fi.. On the Geekbench 3 benchmark, the LG G5 scored 2322 on the single-core test and 5354 on the multi-core test. This is in line with the other early 2016 Android flagships.. Overall, the LG G5 is runs well and should prove reliable, which allay fears of G Flex and G4 owners struck with the infamous bootloop that bricked the smartphones.. The LG G5 smartphone ships with a 2800mAh battery. The Camera Plus module (which includes a photo grip) includes a 4000mAh battery. Nevertheless, the basic battery is good enough, besting the V10 and G4 output by 10%. We were able to stream full HD video for 8 hours and 5 minutes on a single charge, which matches most of the flagships from 2015. By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge lasted 10 hours and 48 minutes, which is outstanding.. The LG G5 supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 protocol, which replenished the battery up to 80 percent in 30 minutes in our tests. Of course, you can always squeeze out more juice by turning off the Always On display feature. LG officially claims Always On uses less than 1 percent of battery capacity per hour, but we showed about a 15% difference during our informal battery tests.. If the modular design doesn’t pull you into the G5, the camera will. One is the same 16-megapixel we loved in the LG V10, which comes with F/1-8 and a field of view at 75 degrees. The second camera has 8 megapixels, F/2.4, but an exceptionally wide angle with a field of view at 135 degrees. LG has managed to secure very clever and creative collaboration between the two cameras with its decent camera software. The smartphone switches between the two cameras depending on the zoom level, and also allows users to manually choose certain shots.. Pop-out Picture enables simultaneous shooting of both rear cameras with one image representing the background and the other the foreground. An effect is then applied to the background (blur, fisheye, vignette), and effects can be combined. Multi-View makes it possible for both, or even all three cameras, to simultaneously record videos or shoot photographs. It is also possible to choose a layout on which the images are then arranged.. Both back-facing cameras are equipped with a laser autofocus (infrared, to be precise) and 3-axis optical stabilization, while the 16-megapixel camera offers fantastic results. Image detail is abundant, even in poor lighting. The cameras offer highly precise exposure, color saturation, and excellent sharpness. It’s certainly one of the best smartphone cameras on the market, perhaps only second to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge.. The 8-megapixel camera does not offer the same level of detail, or poor lighting performance. But it’s very practical for daily wide-angle recordings. The captured angle width is very impressive, perfect for panoramas. And users will need to make sure that the shot does not include their fingers as well.. Video recordings taken with the rear cameras are some of the best ones taken with a phone. Full HD and 4K are available at 30fps, with a high level of visible details. The same goes for the 8-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0, which is among the top front-facing cameras on the market and can record Full HD video clips at 30fps.. Take a look at some photos taken on our LG G5 review unit:. The LG G5 is one of the most powerful smartphones on the market. Its camera and innovative modular design are appealing, as is its powerful and stable chipset.. It’s not the most attractive phone in the world, though. In fact, it looks like a flagship from years past, when style was not a primary concern. But some may see this as a geekish touch worthy of its innovative feature set.. The only remaining question is whether LG continues to push the modular design with new and exciting accessories. As it stands, the LG G5 is an excellent smartphone. With new accessories expanding functionality, it will be that much better..

May 27, 2016 at 6:56 pm. Sorry, I miss the lack of a modern look. I like a large bezel, it reduces the accidental touch of the screen which happens often when a phone is passed around to show pictures or other content. What counts for me are easily accessible buttons and card slots. I have a Samsung Note 4 and I really do not like the volume and power buttons. That is especially true when using a portfolio case and/or using the phone in landscape mode. The buttons should all be on the top or on the front. The shapes and surfaces should allow distinction between them by just feeling them. I always carry a spare battery, just in case I run out of power. To me that is a must.

At this price one cannot ask for more. The camera function is class leading. I am using this mobile with B&O Hi fi plus module .. This is the best audio performance in a mobile phone till date. But you have buy this Hi fi module from us for around Rs.8000/=. Though it had fetched lot of awards internationally , it failed to capture the attention as it lacks premium look. As a full metal body it absorbs shock reasonably , as i dropped it couple of times. Only thing i hate in this unit is the battery backup. My humble submission is that don't look for apple and samsung always. Try LG , NOKIA and others in premium segment. Especially LG is trying very hard to catch up apple and samsung in Mobile phone segments and it may succeed one as it had done in premium OLED TVs.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. By Krishna Rao | 24 Jun 2016. The one I recently had is an excellent. In December 2015 I purchased LG G4. Before that I used SSG Note 3 which troubled me to some extent. Among these three I felt G5 is good. The resolution of the display is very good and the camera features are excellent. Though I prefer large displays for my mobiles, the size of this is comfortable. Though the price was kept at a bit higher side I didn't feel it, since I got the offers, the additional battery pack kit and Korian flip cover free.. Was this review helpful?
