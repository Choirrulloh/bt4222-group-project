Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. While its 18:9 display and near bezel-less build is impressive, the Q6 is tough to recommend over competing options.

For the past few years, Chinese manufactures have dominated the low-end smartphone market. The fierce competition between manufacturers such as Xiaomi , Motorola , and Lenovo has had a very positive effect on consumers. As the number of options available for those on a budget has rapidly increased, so has the amount of value each of those options offers.. Unfortunately, this amount of increased competition has also resulted in more risk aversion. This has made cheap phones today feel predictable and somewhat stale. For example, it’s not difficult to imagine what the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 will bring. While we can appreciate a few spec bumps and slightly newer software, the present feeling of complacency can make phones in this segment feel a tad boring.. LG launches its first smartphone under the new Q series â LG Q6 â in India. LG Electronics has launched its first smartphone under the new Q series, called the LG Q6, in India. The Q series aims to offer LGâs premium features at an affordable price.. The Q6 is the first â¦. LG Q6 brings 18:9 displays to the mid-range, launching tomorrow. Chatter about a new 18:9 device from LG has been confirmed today by the Korean company with a teaser and a launch date set for tomorrow, July 11.. The LG Q6 will be the first mid-ranger â¦. Perhaps that’s why we were excited to take the LG Q6 for a spin. With the Q6, LG, a manufacturer primarily associated with high-end smartphones like the G6. and V30 , has brought their FullVision display technology to the low-end smartphone segment, as predicted .. This raises an important question: was LG able to implement such technology on a shoestring and still create a smartphone well-rounded enough to be worthy of your consideration? Let’s find out with our comprehensive LG Q6 review!. The LG Q6 looks similar enough to the LG G6 to align with LG’s design language, but also does a few things differently to avoid being overly derivative. Yes, the Q6 shares the same front design with minimal bezels, a premium metal frame, and a glossy back. If you take a closer look, however, you will notice some important distinctions.. This time around, the glossy back is plastic instead of glass. Plastic does have a couple advantages. It’s much less likely to crack if you accidentally drop the phone. It’s also cheaper to manufacture, which surely helped LG keep the Q6 affordable.. With that said, the Q6’s plastic back is not quite as premium as the G6’s glass back. It scratches very easily and doesn’t do much to hide fingerprints. For these reasons, we’d suggest considering a third party case in order to better protect your investment.. The rear camera configuration has been reduced to a single lens with the Q6. LG decided to place the lens in the top left corner instead of the top center, likely as a way to make the design appear just slightly more minimal.. This is especially plausible when considering the Q6’s lack of a fingerprint reader. Yes, you read that correctly; there is no fingerprint reader on this device. This could certainly be a deal breaker for some. After all, phones costing half as much even manage to include this important asset.. LG’s answer to this exclusion is to instead use the Q6’s face recognition feature. This feature works by comparing the front-facing camera’s input to a saved profile of your face which you setup in the phone’s settings. This sounds like a great substitute, but does not work well in practice.. The face recognition feature is quite frankly a sorry alternative for a fingerprint reader. In a dark room? Recently shaved your face? Styled your hair differently? Prepare to enter your password manually, as the face recognition won’t be able to recognize you. Add in the increased security risk of using this feature to authenticate, and this is quite frankly a sorry alternative for a fingerprint reader.. With that said, if you can get over not having a fingerprint reader you’ll generally appreciate the Q6’s design. Most impressively, the build quality is better than that of your average cheap phone. The Q6’s solid build makes it apparent that LG did more than just slap on their brand name.. Speaking of branding, the Q6’s is beautifully discrete. A single small “LG” logo blends in extremely well with the front black bezel. This is a nice change from some other phones on the market today.. One of the LG Q6’s main selling points is its FullVision display. You may recall this same technology from the LG G6. The Q6’s display is similar in that it offers the same 18:9 or 2:1 aspect ratio, has elegantly curved corners, and leaves a near bezel-less footprint.. The display size has also been bumped down to 5.5-inches from the G6’s 5.7-inches. This smaller size combined with the compact bezels allows the LG Q6 to be surprisingly small.. The Q6’s compactness is one of our favorite aspects, as it makes the phone considerably easier to use, especially with one-hand. You’ll be hard pressed to find another phone in this price range with a screen-to-body ratio this good.. LG has once again proven that it knows how to deliver a quality display. The display itself is better than we expected too. It’s a 2160 x 1080 IPS LCD panel, and provides good contrast levels and accurate color reproduction. There’s just the right amount of saturation to make colors look vibrant enough but not oversaturated. LG has once again proven that it knows how to deliver a quality display, even when cost is a constraint.. Sunlight readability isn’t the best, but that’s pretty much the norm at this price point. The display is also coated in Gorilla Glass 3, which might be disappointing for anyone hoping for Gorilla Glass 5, but both generations have similar scratch resistance, with Gorilla Glass 4 getting thinner and Gorilla Glass 5 being better at impact resistance while maintaining a similar level of scratch resistance as their predecessor.. Under the hood, the LG is packing an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 435. We won’t sugar coat it — the Snapdragon 435 is a pretty low-end processor. It’s better than some MediaTek chips out there, but it’s far from impressive on paper.. With that said, the LG Q6 is a very capable performer day-to-day. It’s not unbearably slow and unless you compare it directly next to a more expensive phone, you may not notice enough of a difference to make it feel agonizingly sluggish.. The integrated Adreno 505 is one of the better GPUs available at this price, so you won’t have any issues with casual mobile gaming. There’s also 3 GB of RAM, which will be enough for most users.. Interestingly, the LG Q6 will be sold in both single and dual SIM variants. Our unit came unlocked out of the box, but we’re not sure whether LG will partner with some wireless providers in the future to offer customized carrier variants. Either way, you’re getting a microSD card slot so you can expand the phone’s 32 GB of internal storage if needed.. One of the more disappointing aspects of the Q6 is its distorted-sounding rear-facing speaker. It’s been a while since I’ve seen this configuration and for good reason: audio output is almost always flawed when it’s projecting away from your face.. It’s also quite difficult to avoid covering the speaker when placing the phone on a flat surface. Unfortunately, you really get what you pay for here. Luckily, all is not lost as you can still use your standard audio accessories with the Q6 since it features a 3.5mm headphone jack.. LG also decided to stick with a microUSB port. LG also decided to stick with a microUSB port. We understand that some users may not want to upgrade to the new reversible USB Type-C standard. However, it has been out for around two years now and many people have already switched, so we’re going to chalk this up as a negative.. Full disclosure: we were unable to connect to United States 4G LTE networks during our review period as our review unit did not support the proper network frequencies. You won’t have to worry about this when officially purchasing the LG Q6, but we must note that our test results are likely inflated.. With moderate use, the 3,000 mAh battery should be able to get you a full day of use with about four hours of screen on time. That’s pretty good, but not surprising considering how power efficient the Snapdragon 435 processor is.. The phone charges to 50 percent in around 45 minutes. While LG isn’t advertising any fast charging technology for the Q6, we found the phone charges to 50 percent in around 45 minutes. That’s certainly not a bad charging rate given how affordable the Q6 is.. The LG Q6 sports a single 13 MP f/2.2 rear camera. The Q6 not only loses the G6 ‘s adored dual-lens setup, but also its flagship level quality.. The camera is a bit slow to capture images. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. That’s especially true with the cameras here. We should preface our sample images by stating that the camera is a bit slow to capture images.. This is problematic as it prevents you from capturing a sequence of images in a short period of time, so you could very well miss a key moment. The slower camera can also cause motion blur if you don’t have a near perfectly steady hand, which you can see in some of our samples images.. Images taken in good lighting are decent looking. Generally, color reproduction is very good and there’s a decent level of detail. Dynamic range leaves something to be desired, but that’s to be expected at this price point.. Most of these images are good enough for social media platforms. However, if you use your phone’s camera frequently, you may want to consider buying a more expensive smartphone instead.. Our low-light sample images are sadly of significantly lower quality. There’s a bunch of digital noise, images aren’t as detailed, and color reproduction takes a considerable hit.. To be fair, we have yet to see a low-end phone camera perform well in low-light conditions. Still, this is something to keep in mind if you’re able to pay a bit more.. You can record up to 1080p videos with the LG G6, but the video quality is not very good. Please see our video review, linked above, for a sample clip.. The front facing 5 MP f/2.2 camera also isn’t great. As you can see, the selfies are quite blurry and color reproduction isn’t all that accurate.. LG’s built-in camera app provides a basic shooting experience. There are a number of filters as well as three different modes: auto, panorama, and food. Unfortunately, there is no manual mode. We don’t consider this to be much of a drawback since professional photographers will almost certainly gravitate towards more expensive options.. As expected, the LG Q6 ships with Android 7.1.1 Nougat with LG’s UX 6.0 layered on top. This is the same software that’s on the LG G6 .. LG’s software isn’t all that different from stock Android. Instead of adding their own unique software features here, LG has differentiated by making some minor design tweaks. For example, there’s no app drawer by default, the settings menu is organized by tabs, and the system apps have their own designs.. There is also Nougat’s split-screen multitasking feature on board, so you can use two apps at once. The Q6’s 18:9 display really shines in this area, as there is enough vertical space available to comfortably fit in two apps.. Many users will appreciate LGâs balanced approach to the software. We are sure many users will appreciate LG’s balanced approach to the software. This approach has left a solid, polished software experience, which cannot be said about all phones in this price category. With the LG Q6’s software, you get exactly what you expect. The LG Q6 is now available in India for 15,000 INR (â$234). Color options include black, platinum, and gold. Availability in the United States is still to be determined.. LG has also announced a slightly lower-end Q6a and a slightly higher-end Q6 Plus. We expect that these devices offer similar overall experiences, with natural allowances for better or worse hardware. Again, your choice will likely come down to your budget.. With the Q6, LG has successfully brought their FullVision display technology to a very accessible price point. The display’s 18:9 aspect ratio along with the phone’s minimal bezels truly make the Q6 stand out from its competitors. The phone’s compact size (despite its 5.5-inch display) and great software are also good reasons to buy this phone.. We cannot recommend the LG Q6, however. The lack of a fingerprint reader, unimpressive cameras, and other minor issues just make it tough to justify over competing options. Unless you really want a near bezel-less display for a cheap price, you will probably be happier with something else.. As always, please do leave any questions or comments below..

Unofficially titled the “LG G6 mini”, the Q6 is an impressive midrange phone on its own. While it lacks certain flagship features and annoyingly, a fingerprint sensor, the FullVision display and rear-facing camera are stand-out inclusions that you probably won’t find elsewhere for this cheap.. Chip off the G6 block, in a good way. FullVision display is great for multimedia. LG Q6 price and availability Available now starting at $239 (£239, AU$399) Supports GSM networks only, including AT&T and T-Mobile FullVision display and the camera save this phone Taller aspect ratio makes for a more immersive viewing experience 1080p display is crisp and vibrant, but at the cost of color accuracy Camera tech and software is among the most competent around Battery life Camera Anything else I should know? Who's it for and should I buy it?. The LG Q6 is the midrange take on the company’s 2017 flagship smartphone, the LG G6. As you can see for yourself, much of the G6’s visual pizazz has made the transition to the more budget-friendly class intact.. It features the familiar tall aspect ratio, a nearly bezel-free design, and commendable build quality that yields a smooth feeling in the hand. However, given its lower asking price, not every single one of the G6’s finer qualities makes an appearance.. The plastic back, for example, is prone to scratching. You won't find a fingerprint sensor here – a feature served up by the sub-$100 Moto E4. Predictably, the Q6’s internal specs are decidedly ho-hum and don’t pack adequate muscle to hustle through some of the more demanding 3D games available on the Google Play Store.. ( Update : The Q6 has been added to our list of best cheap phones that you can buy right now. Without a fingerprint sensor, it doesn't place very high on said list, but in many ways, it's still a stellar option .. If you've waited to pick up the Q6, you've been rewarded with more color options. Blue, and violet have been added to the list, so black and platinum are no longer the sole color choices .). The budget smartphone arena is competitive as ever and the Q6's downsides are hard to forgive. But, as it's available for as low as $239 in the US with Amazon supported ads, you're still getting a whole lot of phone for the cash.. The Q6 is now available globally. If you're outside of the US, you can snag this phone from your local retailer, but the story is a little more complicated in the US.. LG's new midrange smartphone is available through Amazon's discounted, ad-supported program for a discounted rate. For $239, the Q6 will come stocked with lockscreen offers, ads and a fleet of Amazon apps pre-installed.. If you'd rather have the device clear of any bloatware, it will set you back $299. Keep in mind that this device won't work with the likes of Verizon and Sprint, since its radio only supports GSM networks, including AT&T and T-Mobile.. The Q6 calls out to the multimedia fans with its 5.5-inch FullVision display that pushes away bezels in favor for more screen real estate. Unlike most phones, this one has an 18:9 display that runs at 2,160 x 1,080 – and odd resolution thanks to the odd aspect ratio.. All this means is that it’s literally twice as tall as it is wide. While this doesn’t impact general use all that much, the extra bit of screen gained makes watching movies and playing games a bit more immersive on the Q6, as it did on the G6.. Speaking on the screen’s quality, its LCD is plenty detailed, vibrant and plenty bright, though sometimes to the point where the colors look washed out and the lighting can be harsh on the eyes.. Moving to the cameras, LG’s 13MP single rear-facing sensor is shockingly capable in the right hands – and in favorable lighting conditions. LG’s camera app is fast to boot from the lock screen and though it doesn’t always produce great results, it’s one of the better midrange cameras out there.. Screen size - 5.5 inches Resolution - 2,160 x 1,080 Battery - 3,000mAH Front camera - 5MP Rear camera - 13MP Weight - NA Dimensions (mm) - NA OS - Android Nougat CPU - Snapdragon 435 RAM - 3GB RAM (varies per region) Storage - 32GB w/ microSD. While most of the heavy-lifting is performed by the larger sensor, the front-facing camera is no slouch. At 5MP, the detail presented in each photo isn’t astounding, but being able to swap between regular and wide-angle presentation is an awesome perk that LG loves to stick in its phones.. Adding to this, LG’s camera software continues to be among the best, if not the best, around. From filters to the simple user interface and innovative dual capture that staples two squared-off images together, creators will have a blast here.. Further down in the review, you can check out a growing collection of photo samples that show off the highs and lows of this phone’s capabilities. All said, the Q6 won’t replace your point-and-shoot or your flagship smartphone camera. But if your expectations are checked, this phone will impress.. The LG Q6 packs in a 3,000mAh battery, which for a phone of this size and price is a fairly modest capacity.. Like most phones available now, the Q6 has no issue whatsoever surviving a day of use. However, if you’re a multimedia or Twitter hog like me, you’ll likely finish your day in the 20% area with the Q6.. To give you a better idea on how the battery drains, watching a 90-minute high definition video wiped out 16%. This leaves a healthy amount of life left in the Q6 to stick by your side for the rest of the day. However, if you’re watching the on-and-off YouTube clip, interspersed with a few rounds of Hearthstone, you’ll see the percentage plummet – as you would with any device.. From a zeroed-out state, a half-hour plugged into the charger revives LG’s midrange smartphone to about 25%. It takes a full hour for it to reach 73% and just under an hour and a half to full charge it.. Astoundingly, this phone can lie dormant for days without losing much battery. We left it on over a long, three-day weekend and returned to it still with 87% of the charge remaining.. As we stated above, the LG Q6 is a competent snapper. Intimate, well-lit shots tend to come out as you’d hope they would and selfies pop in both regular and wide-angle presentation.. We had issues with this phone’s low light performance, as we did with its tendency to overblow the highlights in a given photo. This can make shooting on a sunny or overcast day difficult when usually those are the best days to take photos during.. We had a mix of victories and defeats with the Q6. Given its midrange status, we’re delighted that we had more of the former than the latter. Check out the photo album and video sample below.. I was honestly not expecting results this good. In the right light, the 13MP shines.. Click to view in full resolution. Only lit by a lamp some feet away, the sensor doesn't look as magical, but still gets the point across.. Click to view in full resolution. The detail looks decent here, but the highlights are overblown.. Click to view in full resolution. The colors of this bibimbap look stellar in "food mode", but the lack of detail makes this mouth-watering dish look a little less appetizing.. Click to view in full resolution. This diorama was already cast in yellow light and the Q6 did a decent job of picking up the general vibe of the setting. Though it took a few tries to not get a blurry result.. Click to view in full resolution. Notice in the above video sample that the sensor has a difficult finding its focus for some time. Sure, there was a lot to look at, but it's not the best look if you're whipping your phone out to capture some time-sensitive footage. Plus, the SteadyRecord feature, which uses electronic image stabilization (EIS) actually results in a more shaky picture, not less.. At first blush, the Q6 looks like the LG G6. And while we described a few ways in which they’re very different devices, there’s more to it.. Given the slashed price, the Q6 lacks the 2K display found on the more expensive device. Additionally, LG opted for rather scratch-prone plastic on its back. One tumble saw this phone slide across a tiled floor, collecting a surprising amount of blemishes along the way.. This phone also isn’t waterproof, nor does it offer niceties like wireless charging or military-grade build that protects its front screen from cracking. Calling these aspects out aren’t meant to be dings against the Q6, but it’s important to distinguish them given how similar the two phones look.. Lastly, you might want to purchase this phone in your region based on this review. But given that the Q6’s release is staggered, you likely won’t be able to purchase this phone in your region just yet. It’s currently available in South Korea, but is said to be heading west in the coming weeks.. The LG Q6 is for people who want a midrange phone that people will mistake for a flagship. From every angle, it closely resembles the company’s high-end LG G6. But make no mistake: this phone’s innards, which compete with the likes of the Moto G5 , aren’t going to knock your socks off.. Two features really stick out as valid reasons to buy the Q6: its taller aspect ratio screen and the cameras. LG’s user interface scales well with most apps and lends itself to being an awesome screen to watch movies on. Its cameras, while sometimes tough to capture a great moment with, are capable of some surprisingly high-quality results.. If the features above play a large role in your daily life as a phone user, there’s a lot to enjoy with the Q6. However, if you’re stepping down from a flagship in hopes that you can get the same kicks with a cheaper device, this device will miss the target for you..

Terrible equipo, yo lo compre en aquel entonces porque tenia el SO Lollipop, pero fue un gran error hacerlo sin haberlo probado primero, tiene una terrible camara que ni siquiera puede enfocar, el almacenamiento es muy poco y la mayoria es ocupado por android, realmente no queda espacio para instalar aplicaciones, y aunque tengamos una microsd instalada no permite pasar las aplicaciones a la memoria, que ademas no permite poner un ringtone perzonalizado.. Eviten este celular, tiene demasiadas limitaciones.. En vez de descontinuar el lg pro lite, se ubieran dedicado a mejorarlo, es equipo de "gama media" es una basura, la cámara de resolución de antaño, sin posibilidad de memoria expandible? En vez de alardear que tiene 8 gb de memoria interna de la cual casi 5 gb son de android! Deberían de decir que solo tiene 4. Y la calidad de la carátula es terrible, pareciera que pintar una casa con acuarelas esta bien pero la lluvia la a lavar... Se raspa tan fácil como el yeso.

Premium Devices and Elegant Design to a Mid-Range Portfolio. SEOUL, July 11 , 2017 — LG (Electronics) today announced that the LG Q6, part of its new Q series, will be the first smartphone to offer the FullVision display following the LG G6. The Q series offers many of LG’s most sought-out premium features at a competitive price.. LG’s Q series is the company’s latest line of powerful, mid-range smartphones boasting the essential features of LG premium phones at exceptional price points. As the first in the Q series to be announced, the LG Q6 features some of the most desired innovations from LG’s premium G6 smartphone and packages them in a sleek, stunning body highlighted by its FullVision display with minimized bezels. The Q6 family consists of the Q6+, Q6 and Q6α. The three variants cater to different user groups in terms of memory and storage: the Q6+ comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of ROM, the base Q6 delivers 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage and the most affordably-priced Q6α comes with 2GB RAM and 16GB of ROM.. At a time when minimized bezels are an emerging trend in premium smartphones, the Q6 is the first smartphone in the mid-price category to bring this feature to the masses. The unique 5.5-inch FHD+ FullVision display in the LG Q6 with its 18:9 aspect ratio makes video browsing, gaming and multi-tasking more immersive. The smartphone’s “bezel-less” form factor was designed to maximize the screen while still preventing accidental touching of the screen when being held.. And the LG Q6 looks good with its minimalist and sleek design. With no unsightly camera bump and sleek appearance, the Q6 features attractive curves with rounded corners of the body matching the corners of the display. Packaged in a stylish metallic frame, the Q6 manages to be both lightweight and sturdy for a more durable day-to-day usage experience.. And not only does the Q6 look good, it is extremely easy to use. Benefiting from ergonomic research during the development of the LG G6, the Q6 is also comfortable to hold and use with one hand. In another nod to user convenience, LG’s proprietary Face Recognition feature allows owners to unlock the Q6 faster and with less hassle than other facial recognition technologies currently available.. As expected, the LG Q6 carries on LG’s heritage of excellence in optics. The smartphone incorporates a 100-degree wide angle selfie camera that allows shutterbugs to include a large group of friends and family in the shot without effort. The camera’s improved LG UX 6.0 takes full advantage of the 18:9 aspect ratio of the FullVision display. Square Camera Mode makes it easy to “share your squares” or create photo collages using multiple square images.. The LG Q6 is also quite durable. The metal frame surrounding the Q6 is constructed of ultra-strong 7000 series aluminum, one of the highest strength aluminum alloys available and used extensively in industries such as aerospace. The device is subjected to LG’s demanding regimen of over 20 battery tests which include heat, penetration and shock, conditions more stringent than international testing protocols.. “The LG Q6 is a blend of premium features, great performance and attractive pricing, a combination that is extremely important to us as we look at the way consumers are using smartphones around the world,” said Juno Cho, president of LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company. “The Q series is our way of getting the superb experiences with the essence of the LG’s premium line-ups to more consumers’ hands and pockets.”. The LG Q6 will go on sale in key markets in Asia starting next month to be followed by availability in Europe, Latin America and North America onward.. * Specifications may vary depending on the particular market..

LG Q6: Everything you need to know. LG's budget Q6 is comfortable to hold, features bezel-less design. Where to buy an LG Q6. Despite rumors that hinted otherwise, the LG G6 Mini doesn’t exist, and instead LG has launched the LG Q6 , a smaller version of the excellent LG G6 released earlier this year. It is, in all but name, exactly what we would have expected an LG G6 Mini to be. That means a smaller screen, lower specs, and a more affordable price, too. LG has made three different versions of the LG Q6, all split by the amount of internal storage space and RAM they offer.. It’s the screen that will make you want to buy the Q6. Like the G6 , it minimizes the bezels around it for a sleek, really modern style that LG calls FullVision. On the Q6 it measures 5.5-inches and has an unusual 2,160 x 1,080 pixel resolution — described as FHD+ — that’s longer than the standard 1,920 x 1,080 pixels we’re used to seeing on a midrange phone screen. The reason is the elongated 18:9 aspect ratio of the Q6’s screen, just like on the G6.. This makes watching some videos a really immersive, full-screen experience. Check out some of Netflix’s most recent original shows, such as. Daredevil , for evidence, as there are no black bars around the screen. We love it on the G6 , and the prospect of a cheaper phone providing a comparable experience is really enticing. Handling the phone and comparing it to the LG G6, the bezels around the sides of the bright and colorful screen appear slightly larger on the Q6.. The 8.1mm body is thicker than the G6, and the phone is lightweight at 149 grams. The chassis is aluminum, and the brushed metal effect on the curved-edge plastic rear panel has a high quality finish. But it’s the dimensions of the phone that impress, and make the phone really comfortable to hold. It’s 142mm long and 69mm wide, with a 5.5-inch screen. The OnePlus 5 has the same size display, yet is 155mm long and 74mm wide. The Q6 is very compact, even with a large screen.. The 18:9 aspect ratio also means the screen can be split into two perfect squares, which LG uses to its advantage in the LG UX 6.0 user interface, particularly in its Square Camera widget .. Square Camera previews pictures while shooting them, makes cool collages, and perfectly crops pictures for sharing them on Instagram. It’s paired with a 13-megapixel rear camera, and a 5-megapixel wide-angle selfie camera. The G6’s wide-angle rear camera isn’t featured on the G6 , but selfie fans will get to enjoy a 100-degree lens on the front, for fitting more people into the final image. A Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor powers the phone, and a 3,000mAh battery is inside, with Android 7.1.1 hidden underneath the LG UX 6.0 interface. It was smooth and fast when we navigated through the operating system. Google Assistant is on board, along with NFC for Android Pay .. While it’s obvious the Q6 costs less than half the price of the G6, it’s still a desirable little phone, mainly due to the pretty screen which puts one of 2017’s must-have phone features into the hands of those without the budget for a G6 or Samsung Galaxy S8. It’s compact, powerful enough for basic everyday use, isn’t expensive, yet still has a premium look to it. There are three Q6 models from which to choose. The regular Q6 comes with 32GB of storage space and 3GB of RAM, and will be sold in black, white, ice platinum, or terra gold. It’s joined by the Q6+ with 64GB/4GB, and the Q6ɑ (making it the Q6 alpha, rather than the Q6 A) with 16GB/2GB. The Q6+ comes in black, ice platinum, or marine blue, while the Q6ɑ substitutes the blue for terra gold.. The LG Q6 is available to buy in the United Kingdom now, where it costs 250 British pounds without a contract through Carphone Warehouse. Although we weren’t quite sure at the outset how long customers outside Asia would have to wait to receive the Q6, LG has stated the device will arrive in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East. The news comes from SlashGear , and is accompanied by another report from leaker Roland Quandt that the Q6 will land in Germany specifically on August 21 at a price of 349 euros. LG has said it will reveal release dates and prices for each territory independently on a local basis, so stay tuned. Asia was the first to see the Q6 when it was released in August.. LG says the Q6 is the first device in its Q series, so we should look out for more models in the future.. Update: Added in some general impressions of the LG Q6.. We want more colorful phones, and LG is delivering with its G6 and Q6 models. LG will bring new photography-focused K8 and K10 to MWC.

LG Q6 review: A mid-range phone in an identity crisis. LG G6 review: A new way of looking at things. LG Q6 hands on: Check out our release video. I had the opportunity to use the LG Q6 before it hit the market and have to admit it is a device I was curious to try out. Since I was never able to buy the G6 since its arrival, I sprang to this phone with enthusiasm, although I knew my experience would be somewhat different. I didn’t expect to have such a love-hate relationship with the Q6 that would stop me from ditching it altogether, but at the same time I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone either, not with the current state of things in the market.. ✓ Excellent battery life in standby mode. LG Q6 release date and price. Due to the phone’s resemblance to the older brother G6, it is also referred to as the G6 Mini and the nickname really fits. It was released in August 2017 at a an unsettling price of $389.95.. This Q6 could really turn things around in smartphone sales for the Korean brand, but it’s a shame LG isn’t considering the state of the competition. I mention this because for the same amount you can get a smartphone with better characteristics from many online stores.. If you take a look at the Q6’s data sheet you can easily understand why I find the price disproportionate to the device’s performance and how easy it is to find a phone with the same characteristics for a lower price. Is there really someone willing to pay an arm and a leg for a mediocre phone with. a nice design? In my opinion a. $300 price at the launch would have been more appropriate.. LG Q6 design and build quality. The Q6’s design will certainly not make you regret your purchase. The wear marks are quickly visible on the backside. There are a lot of similarities with the LG G6. It feels like a G6 that has done through the washing machine too many times and then shrank, while losing some of the specifications. The fact remains that in terms of design LG has done a really nice job. You don’t see medium-range devices that look like this everyday.. I tried out the black version of the Q6. It has a metal frame with a polished finish on the sides and the now ubiquitous diamond cut where the edge joins with the two sides of the smartphone. The plastic breaks for separating the antennas are not hidden at all.. The back of the smartphone is not made of glass, but instead a plastic material that I found to be vulnerable. After a couple of days of use with the Q6 always in my hand, in my jeans pocket or leaning on the office desk, I found a series of scratches (very faint but still visible) that I would expect from any smartphone. after at least a few months use. I have never abused a phone to such an extent that I noticed signs of wear after only a few days of use.. The rest of the assembly is very good. The device has been certified according to the 810G military standard , which means that the construction quality is excellent. In this model LG completely abandoned the key layout that we’ve. The volume keys are placed in the frame on the left side, whereas the power button is on the right side. There are no back buttons and the fingerprint reader hasn’t been replaced by facial recognition. The only small defect I found is a very slight deformation of the glass in one of the 4 front corners, which is only visible when. checking the reflections when the display is off. I'm sure that it's just a defect on my device in particular and not a problem with the entire product line. That sort of thing can sometimes happen in production.. At first glance, it's really hard to distinguish this Q6 from the top-performing G6 without using the two alongside one another. LG has no zoom function for videos like the Galaxy S8 offers. / © AndroidPIT (Video from Armando Ferreira @ YouTube). Despite the fact that its shape is reminiscent to its older brother, the LG Q6 display is not the same as the G6, but they do both share an 18:9 display format (or 2:1 if you prefer). As far as the size is concerned, it’s 5.5" with FullHD+ resolution (equal to 2160 x 1080) with a pixel density of 442 ppi.. The display uses IPS technology, but there’s no HDR10 or Dolby Vision certification. The colors are very natural and aren’t overly saturated. Whites tend slightly to light blue, but I find it much less noticeable than a yellowish display. The blacks are deep and the contrast is high, but obviously it doesn’t reach the levels of a AMOLED. I’ve really been enjoying looking at photos and watching videos on this screen because they can faithfully reproduce the original.. The brightness is high enough not to become unreadable in direct sunlight, but not good enough to make it pleasant to use your smartphone outdoors during sunny days. The minimum brightness is low enough to avoid annoying darkness. There is also a mode called Comfort View, which reduces the blue light to make it easier on your eyes.. The only thing that really annoyed me is the black bands that are obviously displayed on the sides during full-screen video playback. These bands cannot be removed like they can with the Galaxy S8, which allows you to zoom in slightly on the video to fill the voids. The really annoying thing is that you can zoom in on any app that fills the entire display, but you’re still stuck with these bands when watching a video. Imagine what it looks like when you. with bands on the top and bottom.. The facial recognition function isn’t even on the LG G6! / © AndroidPIT. The Korean company has decided not to implement the fingerprint reader on the LG Q6. In its place it has introduced facial recognition similar to what was already introduced by Google in previous versions of Android, only slightly improved and decidedly more precise and faster. This is not as safe as the iris scan on the Galaxy S8 , but it is absolutely faster.. You’ll notice the lacking fingerprint reader whenever the facial recognition fails (for example, if you’re wearing sunglasses). You have to insert the pin or draw the backup pattern. This becomes frustrating in the long run.. Fortunately, the facial recognition rarely fails. It has been incredibly reliable even in bad lighting. Obviously, in the case of total darkness or when there's only backlighting, it is impossible for the smartphone to recognize you and then unlock autonomously. It is very interesting that when you lift the device from the table, your smartphone automatically activates face recognition and with a positive outcome it will light up and unlock without you having to press a button.. You can continue to improve recognition under different lighting conditions or when you’re wearing glasses! / © AndroidPIT. LG UX is a colorful interface but is still very clean and tidy! / © AndroidPIT. A mix of old and new in the LG Q6's homescreen. The gallery has a trash bin so you can retrieve any photos deleted by mistake./ © AndroidPIT. LG suggests that you remove the battery if your phone doesn’t respond to the commands. It’s a shame this isn’t even possible with the Q6... The device comes with Android 7.1.1 , so the most recently available version of the software. Obviously it doesn’t come in the stock version, and it's customized with UX 6.0 that fits perfectly to the 18:9 display, just like it does on the G6.. Despite the fact that the entire user interface has been modified by LG, most of the elements of the Android stock remain and most of the pre-installed apps are from Google or LG. Furthermore, there is still a very careful design that conforms to material design directives.. The basic homescreen doesn’t show an app drawer, which is instead activated through the settings. The app drawer’s appearance is somewhat similar to Android Jelly Bean and still includes a tab for widgets. You can also customize the color of individual folders or change the theme of icons by downloading new ones from the LG Store.. The Q6 features smart doctors that keep the health and cleanliness of the device under control and even offer advice from time to time. They keep the smartphone free of temporary files, provide more space for RAM, enable power saving and test the hardware if any component isn’t working properly.. LG offers advice on how to use the device around every corner, but in the long run this can become somewhat irritating. The advice can be helpful for those who aren’t accustomed to using a smartphone, but will definitely become annoying for those who know what they’re doing. Moreover, some of the warnings are completely meaningless, but. I’ll go into great detail about this in the battery section.. A top-of-the-range model with an entry level core. 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.1. 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.0. 3D Mark Ice Storm Unlimited ES 2.0. The performance is definitely the greatest weakness of this device. It’s not as if the smartphone performs poorly in every situation, but the larger issue is that its performance should be much better when you consider the price tag. This is a smartphone with a truly competitive design, display and very well maintained software. Why would you ruin this all with an inadequate hardware configuration? This Q6 really disappointed me here.. The Q6 comes with a SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor with an 8-core CPU that has a maximum frequency of 1.4GHz and an Adreno 505 GPU. Don’t be fooled by the number of computing units because the power here is far inferior to the chips that competitors offer, which in the same price range come with the most powerful SoC from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 600 series. The 3GB of RAM is sufficient for most applications, multitasking works well and applications are kept long enough in the background before they are terminated automatically.. Fortunately, as you'll see from the results of the benchmarks, the internal memory is somewhat faster than average, which allows Q6 to remain quite responsive when you switch between various open applications, open new apps or browse the various files in the internal storage.. you can feel the slowness of the SoC in all other situations such as applications with animation (even very simple ones such as Google Keep or Youtube) or games that are not very demanding. Don't even think about downloading games that require good performance with 3D graphics such as Need for Speed Rivals or CSR2. Even simple tasks such as online browsing or writing long messages slow down the user experience.. There are some moments when you forget that this smartphone is not the G6 because you can open the app and move files really quickly. There are other moments, however, when you just want to throw the Q6 out the window because of the obvious slowdowns that prevent you from doing what you want. Again, there would be no reason to complain if the smartphone had a list price of $100 or lower, but since it’s meant to compete with other mid-range devices I wouldn’t recommend it at this time. As I said at the beginning of the review, if the price were to drop, it could be a decent purchase.. The small recess for the speaker: Good idea, but poorly executed. The audio quality from the jack output is generally okay. It’s nothing special, there is no DAC dedicated to HIFI audio and the chipset used by LG doesn’t have the necessary power to guarantee high volumes. The headphones in the package are classic cheap headphones in rigid plastic that can slip out of your ear at any moment. I would have expected at least some low-end in-ear headphones. I had no problem with the use of Bluetooth headphones with the device:. there was more or less a quick connection and standard quality that you would expect from cabled headphones.. The main speaker is the real problem here. LG placed this phone's speaker in the rear where it easily gets covered up. There is also a kind of cavity near the holes dedicated to the audio output. In the middle there’s a small relief that is meant to prevent the sound from being muffled when the device is placed on a flat surface. It’s just a a pity that the relief isn’t large enough, and the result is a choppy and low-quality sound.. Even while the Q6 was sitting on my desk, I missed several messages because the device couldn’t produce sound loud enough. In this case as well, it’s clear LG thought about the problem and even conceived of a solution, but the. Under ‘normal’ conditions (such as placing the phone face down), the speaker has sufficiently high volume of a good quality. But don’t expect the quality to be on par with front and stereo speakers.. Simple and functional interface, even if with few settings. If you want to force or deactivate the HDR you have to switch to the settings. Take a look at the photos taken with this smartphone on Google Photos!. On paper the two cameras are similar to those used in the G6, at least in terms of their features. The back has a 13 MP camera with a pixel size of 1.12 µm. The focal aperture of f/2.2 deviates slightly from the G6’s (which is f/1.7). Without an optical stabilizer, the Q6 is unable to take quality photos at night.. On the front there is a 5MP camera with 1.12 µm pixels, a 100° viewing angle and f/2.2: the exact same specs you’ll find on the G6. It is likely, however, that different lenses or even different sensors were used on the two models (despite similar characteristics). There is otherwise no explanation as to why the two devices take pictures of drastically different quality, as you can see in my test below.. The camera application is simple and gets straight to the point. There are no frills and only a few settings, but they are well-conceived. There is no manual mode and there are only 3 shooting modes. You'll find a few color filters to change the tones in shots. The only real feature I found out of place and uncomfortable to use was the HDR Mode, which is hidden in the settings.. This combination of hardware and software isn’t too reliable. There are situations where you can render perfect photos and other situations where you’ll just have to give up.. Power consumption is minimal with the Q6 in standby mode! / © AndroidPIT. The LG Q6’s battery fortunately doesn’t disappoint. Since the hardware has reduced performance, the battery. has an excellent lifespan and doesn’t drain in standby. You’ll lose hardly any charge at all if you leave your smartphone idle on your desk connected to a stable Wi-Fi network.. During normal use, the smartphone still maintains decent battery life and exceeds that of many other models I've tried. With normal usage that includes messaging, always synchronized accounts, social networking apps, internet browsing, your location set to High accuracy, more than an hour of Spotify and a few minutes of YouTube, I always managed to exceed 4 hours of screen time without using the power saving functions.. Unfortunately, the Q6 sill uses a micro USB for charging and data exchange, so the charging isn’t very fast. I can’t say, however, that it’s any slower to other smartphones with similar features.. 142.5 x 69.3 x 8.1 mm. 2160 x 1080 pixels (442 ppi). HSPA, LTE, NFC, Dual-SIM , Bluetooth 4.2. The idea behind this smartphone is really a good one: an aesthetically similar smartphone with slightly diminished features to keep the price lower than G6. This device is for those people who want a smartphone with a beautiful FullVision display without the need to buy a flagship.. Something, however, has gone terribly wrong in the execution of this idea. It almost seems as if LG was undecided as to who this device is meant for. It isn’t for any user seeking competitive performance (even if not top-range performance). It doesn’t even come close in this regard. It’s not an entry level smartphone because the price is really too high. It doesn’t have a competitive position in the current market, which could make for a real fiasco for the Korean brand. pity because I do actually find the concept behind the device to be quite convincing.. Are you impressed with this stylish device despite its poor performance? What does this product make you think about LG? Let us know in the comments below!. No interest in this phone, but would suggest ALL camera reviews should clarify the degree of implementation of Camera2 API by the OEM on the model. Since introduced in Android L the OEM's remain all over the map in terms of what they do and don't enable on this or that model device. Even if the OEM's stock camera app is (predictably at the low-mid level) junk, if the API is fully implemented there are wonderful third party camera apps to maximize the camera hardware with Camera2 enabled. Not only mag reviews but even some specification listings are silent on what the camera is or is not permitted to do by the OEM.. I too have no interest in this phone. With a 435 processer why even bother. The honor 7x is 199.00 a much better offering. Another reason their always in the red.

LG Q6 Reviews - page 2. Rated 3 out of. The only thing good about it is the display. It does not have a fingerprint reader and the alternative (face detection) is absolute trash, it works 60% of the times. And also the back is made out of cheap plastic that scratches even if you look at it. Finally, a Snapdragon 4 series is unacceptable for a phone above £200.. Rated 5 out of.

One of the most compelling aspects of the LG G6 is its display. Sporting a unique 18:9 aspect ratio and a resolution of 1440 x 2880, the G6 makes it easy to get the big-screen experience without the unwieldy form factor. The only other smartphones to sport 18:9 displays (well, 18.5:9, technically) are the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. The problem is, to get one of these high-end screens, you need to buy a high-end device.. Thankfully LG is focused on bringing its wonderful FullVision display tech to lower-end devices, the first three of which are being introduced today. Enter: the LG Q6, LG Q6 Plus (styled Q6+), and LG Q6a.. As you’ve probably guessed, the standout features on the new Q6 series are their displays. Each one has a 5.5-inch 18:9 FullHD+ display, with a resolution of 2160 x 1080 and a pixel density of 442 ppi. And like the G6, these phones also have curved edges on the screens, which are further accentuated by the subtle curves on the devices’ chassis. All phones in the Q6 lineup sport metallic frames made of 7000 series aluminum, as well.. Surrounding these 18:9 displays are minimal bezels, which, as we mentioned in our LG G6 review, will certainly help with one-handed use.. Under the hood, the entire Q6 lineup features Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon 435 Mobile Platform. The Q6 Plus comes with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage, while the standard Q6 comes with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage, and the Q6a sports a 2/16 GB setup. They all come with non-removable 3,000 mAh batteries, too.. In terms of optics, all three devices share the same 13 MP standard angle rear-facing sensor, along with a 5 MP 100-degree wide-angle front camera. The selfie shooters on these devices also come with LG’s Face Recognition feature. That’s a nice touch, too, considering these devices don’t come with fingerprint sensors.. Finally, all three devices are running Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box, along with LG’s UX 6.0 on top. Q6 owners can take advantage of features like Square Camera Mode , which debuted on the G6..

LG Q6 launches as affordable mid-range sibling of the G6. LG's ready to round out the lineup with some G6 style.. After a handful of rumors pointing to a "Lite" or "Mini" version of the LG G6 launching, LG has announced the new device as the LG Q6. The whole goal of the Q6 is to offer many of the design traits and features of the G6 at a lower price, hoping to capitalize on what has clearly been a successful flagship launch for LG.. The LG Q6 offers the same style of "FullVision" 18:9 display as the G6 with small bezels to carry on the flagship phone's looks. It's slightly smaller at 5.5-inches diagonally and has bumped down to 2160x1080 resolution — an expected drop for a phone landing beneath the LG G6. The metal frame is still made out of 7000 series aluminum to be particularly robust and LG says it's still subjected to "demanding" battery tests.. Capitalizing on the G6's style while cutting back on the specs.. Internally, things are run by a Snapdragon 435 processor, and there's a 3000mAh battery to coincide with its smaller overall size. The overall capabilities expectedly take a step back as well, with the Wi-Fi maxing out at 802.11 n and the Bluetooth at 4.2 — obviously considerable drops from the LG G6's specs. LG moved to a single 13MP camera on the back, but left a 100-degree wide 5MP camera on the front. It also dropped a fingerprint sensor.. But of course because we're talking about LG, the Q6 is actually a "family" of devices subdivided into the LG Q6+, Q6 and Q6α (that'd be "alpha" to you and me). Each one offers a different level of specs in the same body, hoping to hit an even wider potential market with the "same" phone.. The Q6+ has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, actually matching the G6 (or beating it, in some regions), the main Q6 has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage and the Q6α has 2GB of RAM and 16GB storage. The colors available on each model also slightly differ, with each one getting a different color option in addition to black and platinum.. LG will start selling the Q6 family in "key markets" throughout Asia in August, followed by an expansion to Europe, Latin America and North America thereafter. Specifics on which Q6 model will hit each area isn't yet known, along with pricing — considering the specs, we can expect something pretty competitive.. Google Pixel: The two best cameras right now. Everything you need to know about the G6's cameras. LG Q6 BRINGS FULLVISION DISPLAY TO NEW SMARTPHONE LINEUP. LG's Newest Q Series Brings the Essential Features of LG's Premium Devices and Elegant Design to a Mid-Range Portfolio. SEOUL, July 11, 2017 ― LG (Electronics) today announced that the LG Q6, part of its new Q series, will be the first smartphone to offer the FullVision display following the LG G6. The Q series offers many of LG's most sought-out premium features at a competitive price.. LG's Q series is the company's latest line of powerful, mid-range smartphones boasting the essential features of LG premium phones at exceptional price points. As the first in the Q series to be announced, the LG Q6 features some of the most desired innovations from LG's premium G6 smartphone and packages them in a sleek, stunning body highlighted by its FullVision display with minimized bezels. The Q6 family consists of the Q6+, Q6 and Q6α. The three variants cater to different user groups in terms of memory and storage: the Q6+ comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of ROM, the base Q6 delivers 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage and the most affordably-priced Q6α comes with 2GB RAM and 16GB of ROM.. At a time when minimized bezels are an emerging trend in premium smartphones, the Q6 is the first smartphone in the mid-price category to bring this feature to the masses. The unique 5.5-inch FHD+ FullVision display in the LG Q6 with its 18:9 aspect ratio makes video browsing, gaming and multi-tasking more immersive. The smartphone's "bezel-less" form factor was designed to maximize the screen while still preventing accidental touching of the screen when being held.. And the LG Q6 looks good with its minimalist and sleek design. With no unsightly camera bump and sleek appearance, the Q6 features attractive curves with rounded corners of the body matching the corners of the display. Packaged in a stylish metallic frame, the Q6 manages to be both lightweight and sturdy for a more durable day-to-day usage experience.. And not only does the Q6 look good, it is extremely easy to use. Benefiting from ergonomic research during the development of the LG G6, the Q6 is also comfortable to hold and use with one hand. In another nod to user convenience, LG's proprietary Face Recognition feature allows owners to unlock the Q6 faster and with less hassle than other facial recognition technologies currently available.. As expected, the LG Q6 carries on LG's heritage of excellence in optics. The smartphone incorporates a 100-degree wide angle selfie camera that allows shutterbugs to include a large group of friends and family in the shot without effort. The camera's improved LG UX 6.0 takes full advantage of the 18:9 aspect ratio of the FullVision display. Square Camera Mode makes it easy to "share your squares" or create photo collages using multiple square images.. The LG Q6 is also quite durable. The metal frame surrounding the Q6 is constructed of ultra-strong 7000 series aluminum, one of the highest strength aluminum alloys available and used extensively in industries such as aerospace. The device is subjected to LG's demanding regimen of over 20 battery tests which include heat, penetration and shock, conditions more stringent than international testing protocols.. "The LG Q6 is a blend of premium features, great performance and attractive pricing, a combination that is extremely important to us as we look at the way consumers are using smartphones around the world," said Juno Cho, president of LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company. "The Q series is our way of getting the superb experiences with the essence of the LG's premium line-ups to more consumers' hands and pockets.". The LG G6 will go on sale in key markets in Asia starting next month to be followed by availability in Europe, Latin America and North America onward.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 1.0 out of 5 stars Extremely disappointed. Got the device today and tried the camera app. The phone started heating up and I was afraid that it might explode in ny hand. Locked the screen and tried again after some time, but again the heating started. Called the customer care to return the phone, but it looks like they accept returns only if the temperature exceeds 44.5 degree celsius. I was told that a complaint(550154411) has been raised but nobody contacted me after that. I installed a temperature app and saw the temperature going up to 41.7 degree celsius with only the camera app open. Should the device actually explode for it to be eligible for a return? Never expected this from Amazon.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Display and design is great. I loved the phone, best part its display .with 5.5-inch display it seems like 4.7inch screen.So you can hold the phone in single handle very easily. But I find 1 drawback, that sometimes phone heats up after browsing internet and battery backup is not very great .. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Good one at the price. Reviewing after one month of usage. Purchased this during Great Indian Sale with exchange of old mobile and HDFC cashback. First good point is the screen display size which is awesome. Can withstand for more than 14hrs of normal day usage with 4G. Performance is good with no hang or lag. I encountered mobile hang one time. UI is also good with both LG own and Andriod layouts. One time screen replacement free is good. As usual, Amazon delivery is awesome. Cons : (was already aware of these before purchase) Camera is less than expected at this cost. Face recognition unlock has a delay. Attracts more scratches easily on mobile back cover. Can definitely go for this mobile during offer price.. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Not worth. Not worth coz battery drains out very fast , say a full battery worns out within 4 hours. Thats a serious issue as by 1300 hrs u are looking for a charger. No turbo charger so it takes longggggg time to charge. 2ndly battery heats up witin few minutes of use. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Not again LG, kindly user and time test your mobiles. Keeps forgetting the screen time out setting, and reverts to 30 seconds timeout for the umpteeth time, which is highly irritating, hence this review :) And that too after receiving a 894 mb update lol. Makes me wonder what was there in this 'big' update. It was the case with the LG G4 as well, which additionally used to forget the sounds and volumes settings (used 2 of them, threw one away within a few months due to a half screen issue), hope LG is listening to better their efforts.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good device. The device is awesome in it's defined specifications range. I won't say it is THE BEST but if you are a normal user who wants a decent device you can go with this. Audio, Video, camera and editing effects are pretty good. Device handles good data speeds and call quality is great even in the low signal. Face unlock is better than other peers when compared in similar lighting conditions but it's not too practical. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good build. I purchased this smartphone in exchange of iphone 5s. This phone is very good in terms of build quality when you will hold the phone u will feel like you are holding any premium device also this phone gives a good multitasking experience.. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Can we used as a secondary device is not as the primary device. This is my review for usage of two months for this phone On papers this very decent phone, The brand LG ask you to pay more amount compare to others but this cannot be used as a primary device for anyone it can only be used has secondary or standby device. You will not be able to expect more from this phone, camera is okay other functions and usage and storage is fine and it’s normal as other phones nothing bad or nothing special to appreciated .I use this phone as my secondary phone I don’t use much of this phone based on this everything is okay. For me that’s not a problem but the battery drains very soon. And your left hand side back panel gets heated for a span of 30 minutes of regular usage of anything if maybe YouTube Facebook “you may be working on your phone anything. left hand side back panel gets heated very soon and if you’re thinking this as your primary device please do not go for this if you think you need an brand like in LG with low-priced phone 18:9 screen full HD then u can make call on this. But don’t buy if it’s your primary device. Was this review helpful to you?. I bought the phone as a gift for my father. The phone started out as being great while using. 2.0 out of 5 stars The phone started out as being great while using. 12 second to dig out number.
