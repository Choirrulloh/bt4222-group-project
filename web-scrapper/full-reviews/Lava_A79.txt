Lava, the Indian manufacturer has managed to survive in the industry so far with constant new launches & marketing. Main segment of the brand being under Rs. 10,000, Lava is here with a new phone named Lava A79. The phone is available around Rs. 4,000 & is one of the cheapest phone company has to offer. Of course, it skimps on certain important features.. The phone, despite being cheap has premium looks but does not feel the same once you hold it. It has a plastic body & feels nothing like good after holding it. On the front of the Lava A79 is a 5.5-inch display with a resolution of 800x480 pixels, giving it a pixel density of 170PPI. The big display sounds good for people looking to use it for media consumption, however, the resolution might not be able to deliver the best experience. There is no Gorilla Glass protection on the display.. This phone comes with a Spreadtrum SC7731G Quad Core chipset that is combined with Mali-400 MP2 GPU. You also get 1GB of ram which should not be good neough if you happen to multitask. And on the software front, Lava A79 comes comes with Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box & there are slim to none chances of it receiving future Android updates.. On the rear of the device we have a 5MP camera with an Dual LED Flash. The camera can do videos up to 720p. Whereas on the front lies a 2MP basic camera with an LED Flash as well. The flash surely helps you with light for selfies but the 2MP camera itself might not deliver any good shots. Coming to the storage, it comes with 8GB of internal storage of which just 4GB to 5GB will be available for the user. You may also expand the storage up to 32GB more via a MicroSD card.. To power all this it has a 2200mAh battery that is non user replaceable & should last you a day. Lava A79 supports Dual SIMs but unfortunately does not support 4G LTE network & hence no Jio support too. Besides, it has the basic WiFi & Bluetooth for connectivity..
