Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $170 Buy.

SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) is a small card that contains mobile network subscriber's account information. This allows the phone using the card to attach to a mobile network. The SIM card is most commonly associated with GSM and UMTS mobile networks. Moving a SIM card from one phone to another allows a subscriber to switch mobile phones without having to contact their mobile network carrier. SIM cards can also be used by a phone to store limited amounts of data, such as phone numbers and text messages. Display Technology => A number of display technologies and types used in mobile phones => TFT (Thin Film Transistor), IPS (In-Place Switching), OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode), AMOLED (Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode), Super AMOLED (an even advanced version of AMOLED), Resistive Touchscreen (Resistive touchscreens contain two layer of conductive material with a very small gap between them which acts as a resistance), Capacitive Touchsceen (Capacitive touchscreen technology consists of a layer of glass coated with a transparent conductor). Display Colors is refers to the number of different shades of colors that the screen is capable of displaying => 64K colors, 256K colors and 16 million colors, Obviously 16M is highest available range of colors and better than others. Pixel Density (PPI) is refers to the concentration of pixels on a particular display, measured in pixels per inch (ppi). Pixel density is calculated by dividing the diagonal pixel resolution of a display by its diagonal size, higher pixel density better display quality. Camera is able to capture photographs and usually videos, The most important characteristics of a camera are the resolution (measured in megapixels), lens focus type (fixed or automatic), higher megapixel cameras are known to capture higher quality photos, but not always a good measurement of the photos quality. Flash Light => There is commonly two types of flash lights are used in camera mobile phones, LED Flash (LED flash offers lower power consumption with drive circuitry that takes up very little room, LEDs can be strobed faster than any other light source), Xenon Flash (xenon flash produces an extremely intense full-spectrum white light for a very short duration). Geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, panorama. OS => Every computer system run on a base software called Operating System (OS). Operating System controls all basic operations of the computer (such as smartphone, PDAs, tablet computers and other handheld devices). The Operating System allows the user to install and run third party applications (apps), apps are used to add new functionality to the device. UI or user interface of a device is the look and feel of the on-screen menu system. How it works, its color scheme, how it responds to button presses, all of these things are part of the user interface. Java for Mobile Devices is a set of technologies that let developers deliver applications and services to all types of mobile handsets, ranging from price efficient feature-phones to the latest smartphones.

Samsung? No way, that Note 7 almost killed me. Even 5s still gets updated and if iOS 12 is gonna be a performance update only then it'll be still updated. And no android will give you day one performance by just changing the battery (you can DIY, batteries online are like £7-10. Fingerprint scanner is good and hardware ok for this price point, if you can handle some lag. Phone is from September 17 and last security patch is from that September too. So no updates or information about them with this phone. Obsolete by software, don´t recommend this who cares about security. (Emui 5 though is better with some nifty features.). Get some Nokia phone instead with promised updates, if you are on budget. Nokia 3, 5 or 6 or wait coming models from MWC this month. Even J3 (2017) is better choice. Huawei seems to make good hardware with competitive price, but ruins them with lack of software support being one of the worst in that..

Overall, for the price range is a good phone.. Please, can anybody tell me which to buy: Huawei p9 lite mini or Huawei 6 2017?. NFC, 17 Sep 2017 Have this model Huawei P9 lite mini NFC technology? Thanks. best buy for 2017 if you ask (this and samsung j3 2017). Jallon, 25 Oct 2017 You must be pro or con Huawei... The better question is, this one or Huawei Y6 2017? After using this and Nokia 5, i decided to keep huawei. Is it normal to have so poor/no focus at 2 m? And poor focus on filming?. This is a fantastic phone at this price the over all performance is great no lagging and a long battery life. This one or Moto E4? i need buy a good and economic phone. This is called the Enjoy 7 (non-Plus) in China. I imported this phone into the UK and have to say it works splendid on O2-UK. However, camera performance is on the average side, and it was a lengthy process setting up the device for UK use.. So, after using this phone for a couple of days, here are my first impressions:. First of all I should say I'm an average user. I need the phone for usual day to day stuff like answering calls, instant messaging, browsing and occasional snapshot, and obviously I wasn't ready to shell out couple hundred dollars. So having all that in mind I set out to find me a new cheap, but not totally rubbish phone. So I found p9 Lite Mini... Overall design is good, but the phone is very slippery. I had to buy a back cover to prevent it from slipping out of my hands and breaking. User interface looks neat and is very customizable. Phone is fast and I haven't experience any lagging so far. The fingerprint sensor is very fast, I guess. There's a lot of talk of fingerprint sensors being "fast" or "slow". My previous phone was Nexus 5x and it's sensor was consideret top notch, and with P9 I ca't really tell if there's any difference in speed of unlocking. You can also answer phonecalls using your sensor so that's practical. The screen is far from the best on the market, but looks very crisp I must say. Yet again, I can only compare it to Nexus, which on paper has far better screen. Again, only slight difference between the two. The best thing about this phone is that it has kick ass battery. I can go two days on one charging even with heavy use (no gaming, just browsing non stop and watching youtube videos). The bad thing is there is no fast charging. Especially experiencing it after 5x this is a huge step down. In daylight, if you get lucky, you can take a good photo. In places with dimmer lights like bars, or even on the street with street lights you can forget about this camera. And this is without using flash. I never use flash when I take photos so I don't know how they turn out with flash, but honestly who uses flash anymore? Maybe your parents and aunts. But, you get what you pay for. I'm gonna have to take some time getting used to a rubbish camera, but overall for now I'm satisfied with this phone. If you're looking for a phone for basic stuff that is cheap but not too crappy, this might be the one. If you're into snapshots then look away. I got it on a very good deal with a two year waranty so I can't be happier. People also suggested me that I look into Xiaomi phones but in my country the only ones selling them are online shops, and I don't trust their warranty because they'll do anything to find a reason not to fix your phone, and you can only dream of a refund if something goes way down south with it. Pros: Good battery, nice looking design, nice screen despite being very average on paper. Cons: Camera is disappointing, no fast charging. Ivan, 23 Oct 2017 this one or nokia 5?

Qualcomm MSM8917 Snapdragon 425 chipset, Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Adreno 308 graphics and 2GB RAM. 13MP primary camera with autofocus and LED flash. 16GB internal storage + microSD expansion slot up to 128GB maximum. Coming so late towards the end of the year is Huawei P9 Lite Mini, which seems to be a last-ditch attempt at last year’s flagship.. Let’s first do a quick throwback at the P9 which dominated the flagship scene last year. It was among the first few smartphones to feature dual primary camera, and it started off the whole revolution within the industry.. Here you go again with the P9 specs:. For those looking for a flagship performance with a superior dual 13MP primary camera, look no further than the P9.. But that was last year’s talk, this year we’ve seen dual camera technology and Fullview display becoming more and more prominent, as well as 5.5-inch smartphone screen size becoming the standard these days.. Let’s now take a closer look at the P9 Lite Mini as per below:. We all know how Mini usually means a reduction in size, while Lite is a scaled down version; and that’s exactly what happened to the P9 Lite Mini. Starting with the smaller 5-inch IPS screen with just a High Definition resolution to its name. Luckily the fingerprint sensor is still there, as well as its exquisite metal body with front glass.. In terms of performance, the P9 Lite Mini barely makes it these days. In fact, you can say that it falls in the entry-level for 2017 with the Snapdragon 425 chipset, slow quad-core processor, decent graphics and just 2GB RAM.. Same goes to the smartphone, camera-wise. There’s only the 13MP-5MP camera combination found on it that ensures you have an average camera experience with it. If you are not the fussy type, then it should please you just nice.. Moving on to the storage side of things, a limited 16GB of internal storage is found on the P9 Lite Mini. Again, there’s barely enough space but that’s fine though. Thankfully, there’s the microSD expansion slot that you can easily add an additional 128GB of space.. With Android Nougat 7.0 running the show for P9 Lite Mini, it is kind of pleasing. But seeing that this is an entry-level smartphone, don’t get your hopes up high that it will get an update to the latest Android Oreo 8.0.. Battery-wise, the 3020 mAh-rated battery should do enough to power up the smartphone for a full day of use.. There you go folks, with Huawei P9 Lite Mini. It is one last ditch attempt at closing the books on last year’s flagship, and it seems to be suffering a miserable ending. Especially with the kind of price, you have lots of other alternatives that you can consider.. Huawei P9 Lite Mini is available for $219 USD and is available in Silver, Black and Gold colours..

Huawei P9 Lite Mini, a decaffeinated version of the P9 Lite. Specifications of the Huawei P9 Lite Mini. 16 GB of storage with microSD. Price and launch of the P9 Lite Mini. Huawei P9 Lite Mini, less power but same camera. Huawei is a Chinese company that we all already know. When we say Huawei or Xiaomi the most conventional claim that the Chinese of Huawei have nothing to do, they are a much more important and reliable brand. In our case we have seen how Xiaomi has surpassed in quality / price to Huawei but it is true that it is not yet so integrated in our society and not only by the people but by the lack of global versions in many of its devices.. Now, without launch or presentation, Huawei has just put on sale in some European countries the new Huawei P9 Lite Mini , a decaffeinated version of the Huawei P9 Lite.. Samsung does the same, no one is surprised, every year launches a new J5 with appellation of origin the following year, that simple. Huawei has not found another way to do so and since its high end do not come out at the same time as its decaffeinated versions are forced to release these versions with rare names.. First was the Huawei P8 Lite 2017 after launching the Huawei P9 Lite and now is this new Huawei P9 Lite that does not reach the low range but that is behind the original P9 Lite. We have a metal phone with fingerprint sensor on the back and a single sensor camera with a more curved and ergonomic design line.. And all with Android 7.0 Nougat and the EMUI customization layer. That yes, despite reducing the RAM and the processor this mobile retains the camera of the original Huawei P9 Lite so it will get very good pictures even though it goes down a bit in general ranges.. The device has been put on sale in Europe, only available in some countries but you can buy from 190 euros , a pretty decent price for a device of this style. We can see it in gold, gray and black, for the moment..
