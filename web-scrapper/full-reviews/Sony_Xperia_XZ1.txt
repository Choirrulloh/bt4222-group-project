After wandering in the cel phone wilderness for the last year or so, the electronics giant pulled their collective heads out of their collective hindquarters and have delivered a very good (if not quite great) flagship mobile device. The past 12-16 months gave us the X, the X Compact, the X Performance, the XZ, the XZS, the XA1, and a gaggle of other mid-tier offerings from Sony. Of them, only the XZS and the XZ Premium could come close to laying claim to flagship status, with the latter coming with one of the finest 4K displays in the business. Unfortunately XZS didn't come with a battery big enough to power the nice phone specs, and the XZ Premium was an exceptionally large phone, at an exceptionally large price. The XZ1 sees the company step up it's game. As of this writing, it's one of the few devices shipping with Android 8 / Oreo out of the box, running the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, with a beautiful 1080 display and a slightly-refined physical design and sturdy-feeling build-quality. And for nearly $700, it certainly should have a premium feel to it. Even the best phones are balancing acts of compromise, so while there's certainly something here for everyone, it's also unlikely to appeal to absolutely everyone. Most people either love or hate Sony's take on industrial design. Some bemoan the size of the top and bottom bezels. In a world where the S8 strives to give customers nothing-but-screen, Sony certainly isn't following the fashion train. But they sure as heck are following the functional-device-train. Having owned an S8, I certainly see the appeal. But at the end of the day, I found the lack of bezels to be a problem in day to day use. With no edge on which to rest fingertips, I was constantly accidentally activating various apps, or accidentally hitting the wrong onscreen area within a given app. Nice to look at...but darn if it's not a pain to actually use. So, here's a subjective run down of Pros and Cons: PRO - Great screen. In addition to it's Triluminous setting, Sony has added a new video color-saturating setting. Honestly, it looks like they're taking a stab at the popping colors and deep blacks on OLED devices like the S8. And they've done a good job...this is one of the sharpest, most color popping screens out there at the moment. - Headphone jack / Audio processing. Yay for hanging on to this bit of tech, the old headphone jack. Bluetooth headphones are well and good, but they eat up a battery, and they can't deliver the same quality of audio as a wired set. If how your music sounds on your device is important to you, wired is still the way to go. And Sony's DESS audio processing sounds pretty great to my ears. Pick up a third party audio player like Neutron if you'd like even more control of the sound. This really doesn't belong in the "con" column, but the fact is either you like what Sony is doing here, or you don't. Sony offers a handful of budget models, but their flagship line has never been anything but pricey. Especially in America where the brand isn't known for it's mobile devices, the average android user might be hard pressed to pay $699 to a company they normally associate with televisions. In Europe and Asia, though, Sony remains a popular contender with Samsung and Apple for high end devices. This also might not be a negative, as the new Snapdragon and Oreo are alleged to be more efficient with their power use. Running some benchmarks seem to bear this out, as while it leads in most areas, there are some processes they've scaled back. So far, I don't see any penalty in processing power, but I've also not had it long enough to take a firm stance on battery life. But anecdotally, it does seem to be an improvement over the XZS and XZ Performance.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars This is finally what feels like a truly matured phone from Sony. I bought the international unlocked version because I was too impatient to wait until it was officially available in the US, but I had to come here and share my thoughts about the XZ1. First of all, this is finally what feels like a truly matured phone from Sony. From design to camera, it finally feels like Sony has something that can compete with the rest of the phones out there. I'm gonna break up my thoughts below by pros and cons. Pros: - I love the updated design with its curved back and slim profile. The phone is much easier to hold in the hand. - The display, even for a 1080p, it's gorgeous and more than what any mobile user needs. The color enhancements give you enough options to customize it to your liking. - HDR support on Amazon Prime and Youtube is sweet. - The battery is crazy good. I had the S8+ and it would only last from 6am to 9pm before I needed to recharge on a normal work day with heavy use. Not sure what Sony (and Oreo) did, but I can make it to 9pm and still packing 45% of the battery. - The software is the usual smooth as silk from Sony. The light enhancements on top of the stock Android add character but doesn't take away from the performance in the least bit when compared to the Pixel. - The camera experience has been dramatically improved over the past Xperia phones. I tried out the XZs and hated the camera, and while the XZ1 packs the same camera sensor, they finally did something with the post processing and the results are impressive. The camera shutter is much more responsive, so no more missed or blurry shots. - The slow video is a cool feature, but you can only take advantage of it in good lighting. - Sony has the best fingerprint scanner implementation, period. Having it built as part of the power button is in the most ideal location and it's crazy fast and accurate. - Headphone jacks are still great, and I'm glad to see Sony isn't jumping on that bandwagon yet. Cons: - I'm not on the same anti-bezel craze that everyone is on, but it would be nice to see Sony start to move in that direction. I personally feel like the phone is much easier to use when compared to the S8+ and the likes, so I could care less either way. - The stereo speakers are nice and loud, but a little too "high" in note. - [UPDATE AFTER 1 WEEK OF USE] I'm noticing that the display's oleophobic (anti-fingerprint) coating isn't as good as some other phones. The screen gets packed with fingerprints very easily. It's definitely worse when compared to the Samsung or iPhone and much worse compared to the OnePlus 3T (which had the best oleophobic coating of any phone I've ever used). Again, you're probably saying "those bezels in 2017?" Don't, and don't get turned off by them. The phone is still a beautiful piece of hardware and the usability beats any edge-to-edge display..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Sony's XZ1 and XZ1 Compact are all about the camera tricks. Both phones let you 3D scan your friend's face to set as your wallpaper or print into figurines.. by August 31, 2017 4:15 AM PDT. See Sony's Xperia XZ1 phone bring your face to life. Sony's new phones are all about the cameras. Sony's new XZ1 and smaller XZ1 Compact have plenty of bragging rights but it's the new camera tricks that are most exciting.. They both feature a new 3D scanning mode. Line up your friend's face in the guidelines, and by moving the phone steadily around them, you can build up a full 3D image of their head. It actually seemed to work really well in our testing time, and you can do it with food or other objects, too.. You can set that 3D head as a live wallpaper for your phone, put the face into augmented reality avatars, or even send it to a 3D printer if you want a physical copy of their head on your desk. There's also a great burst mode, which shoots full 19-megapixel resolution photos at 10 frames per second and tracks the focus of the subject at the same time. As the person gets closer to the camera, the auto focus will shift to make sure they remain in focus.. Finally, the new face detection aims to automatically snap a shot of your friends' smile before you miss it and they start frowning again. You can then choose between the shot you took yourself or the shot that the phone thinks looks better.. Beyond the camera, you'll find a top-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, a waterproof design and the latest Android Oreo software. The 5.2-inch display has a full HD (1,920x1,080-pixel) resolution.. It's joined by the Xperia XZ1 Compact. It has the same camera -- including all the tricks -- and internal specs as its big brother but a smaller 4.6-inch full HD display..

The Sony Xperia XZ1 is just as solid, and just as frustrating, as its recent predecessors. Sony has made another flagship smartphone that gets the core elements right – display, camera, battery, power – but none really excel.. First phone with Android 8 Oreo. Camera not as good as rivals. High price, yet 'only' Full HD display. Sony Xperia XZ1 price and availability Launch price: £599, $699.99 US release date: September 19 UK release date: September 22 Design Slick premium design, but it looks dated and bezel-heavy Water and dust resistance, with easy-access microSD slot Display 5.2-inch Full HD display isn’t as high-res as expected for the price HDR supports provides an excellent viewing for video. The Sony Xperia XZ1 is the latest flagship phone from the firm, but you’d be hard pressed to tell that at first glance.. That’s because Sony has once again indulged its seemingly irrepressible passion for its omnibalance design, which has changed only insubtle ways over the last four years.. You’d be forgiven for thinking the Xperia XZ1 is a couple of years old, such is its similarity to previous handsets such as the Xperia XZ from 2016, which is its immediate predecessor, as well as the Xperia Z5 (2015) and Xperia Z3 (2014).. At least the specs are more 2017 though, with a Snapdragon 835 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 19MP rear-facing camera, HDR support for the display and Android 8.0 Oreo on board.. That said, in a year when Samsung, LG and Apple have all gone almost bezel-less, and HTC and OnePlus overhauled their design propositions, it’s hard not to feel like Sony is slipping behind its rivals.. Watch our video review of the Sony Xperia XZ1 below.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 release date is September 19 in the US and September 22 in the UK, and while we don’t have availability dates for other regions we expect it to arrive in key markets around the same time.. As for the Sony Xperia XZ1 price, it’s set at £599 ($699.99, around AU$875) SIM-free at launch in the UK.. That makes the Xperia XZ1 a touch more expensive than the LG G6 , HTC U11 and iPhone 7 , but cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 .. The Xperia XZ1 is the successor to the Xperia XZ, and while Sony has refined its new flagship phone for a slicker, more impressive finish, the design hasn’t moved on in a significant way for several years now.. It means the Sony Xperia XZ1 looks a little dated, especially next to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 boasting impressively small bezels – and with the iPhone X adopting this futuristic look as well it feels like Sony is missing a trick.. It’s not the only manufacturer to keep the additional space around the screen though – the new iPhone 8, HTC U11 and OnePlus 5 all boast sizable bezel – but there’s no question that the bezeless brigade look better.. As we’ve mentioned though, Sony has subtly refined its design once again. First off, the Xperia XZ1 is a touch thinner than its predecessor at 7.4mm (down from 8.1mm), and it boasts a metal unibody carved from a single piece of aluminum, giving it a strong yet surprisingly lightweight feel in the hand – an improvement over the XZ.. There are three antenna breakout points on the handset, which appear as three slender bands on the sides of the device. Sony says these will improve network connection no matter how you’re holding the phone; in short, there’s less chance your hand will block all the antennas on the Xperia XZ1.. These are minor improvements, as are the even more rounded edges, which make the XZ1 feel more secure in hand and easier to hold – although without the gently curving edges like you get on the Samsung Galaxy S8 it’s still stretch to reach a finger across the screen.. Around the sides you’ll find the usual suspects – there's a SIM and microSD tray on the left, while on the right are the volume rocker, dedicated camera button and concave power button.. Two notes on the buttons: first, the volume rocker has been shrunk, reducing the margin of error when you’re adjusting the volume. It’s a minor point, but we’d have liked a slightly longer key for a more natural input.. Second – and yet again – Sony has omitted the fingerprint sensor from the XZ1 in the US, while in other regions, including the UK, it's built into the easy-to-reach side-mounted power key.. The power key hides the fingerprint scanner, but not in the uS. The SIM tray is also needlessly fiddly. First you have to remove the plastic cover, which slides out with a microSD tray attached to it. This makes swapping expandable storage in and out easy, but the SIM tray doesn’t come attached.. Instead you have to dig out a separate plastic tray with your fingernail. It’s not easy, nor intuitive, and there’s no reassuring click when you slide the tray in to tell you it’s properly inserted.. The plus point here is that you don’t need a SIM tool to insert or remove the card, but we’d have liked the tray to be attached to the plastic cover like the microSD tray.. In true Sony Mobile tradition the Xperia XZ1 is also IP65/68 certified, meaning it’s fully dust- and water-resistant, while also being able to survive a dunk in the wet stuff without frying itself.. Around the XZ1’s top and bottom caps, the soft edges make way for the glossy, diamond-cut metal trim. The bottom plays host to the USB-C charging port, while you’ll find a 3.5mm headphone port on the top.. The SIM tray is needlessly fiddly. Sony has packed dual front-facing speakers into the Xperia XZ1, and these feature its new S-Force surround technology, which provides 50% more sound pressure than the speakers on the XZ.. This allows you to enjoy stereo surround sound while watching movies or playing games. We found the sound to be very good, and we much prefer the speaker placement over Samsung’s and Apple’s insistence on bottom-firing, single speakers which can be easily muffled by your hands.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 is available in four colors: Black, Warm Silver, Horizon Blue and Venus Pink, although it’s currently not clear if all those hues will come to every region the handset is sold in.. Finally on the design front, the back of the phone has received a tweak. The main camera sensor is located in the familiar place in the top-left corner, but the flash and laser have been relocated horizontally in the center of the handset.. Overall the Sony Xperia XZ1 has a smart, premium design which could well be suited to business professionals, but there’s no getting away from the fact that it looks dated compared to its rivals.. The full HD, HDR display is great for supported movies. The display on the Sony Xperia XZ1 is another feature you wouldn’t expect to see on a flagship Android phone in 2017.. What you get is a Gorilla Glass 5-covered 5.2-inch 1080p display. At this size the screen is sharp, text is easy to read and images are rendered with a high level of detail.. However, for the same money – and in some cases less – you can nab a flagship smartphone with a QHD display from a rival, providing even more detail, color and punch direct to your eyeballs.. Considering that Sony has already slapped a 4K display on the Xperia XZ Premium, it makes the decision to drop all the way back to 1080p on the XZ1 all the more puzzling.. It’s not all bad news though, as Sony has added HDR support to the screen on the XZ1, which means you can enjoy bright, clearer and more impactful visuals from supported services including YouTube, Amazon Prime and Netflix.. Videos with HDR support look impressive on the XZ1’s display, and it makes for an enjoyable viewing experience. The chunky bezels above and below the display are useful here too, as it gives you somewhere to rest your thumbs without covering any of the display.. Next Page Battery life and camera.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 2 Software, Processor, Performance and Connectivity. 3 Camera, 3D creator and Media. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Nick Todorov. Android - Android + Sony - Sony +. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 2 Software, Processor, Performance and Connectivity. 3 Camera, 3D creator and Media. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. What are the feelings that rush through your head when you touch something dear to you – an object that moves you emotionally? Excitement, joy, awe, and inspiration all come to mind, but the Japanese have a term dedicated specifically to that kind of multifaceted experience – kando. Sony takes pride in the fact that kando is at the root of its design philosophy – its products are not only meant to serve a practical purpose; they must also make one go "Wow!". Will the Sony Xperia XZ1 – Sony's latest Android flagship smartphone – have that kind of impact on us? We spent a couple of weeks in its company to find out. Design The classic Sony look is distinct and instantly recognizable, but its age is starting to show. While it is true that Sony's phones haven't changed much over the past few years, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Xperia phones are distinct and recognizable. They stick to their own style without trying to mimic the looks or feel of any competing product. Kudos for that! The metal-made Xperia XZ1 in particular feels reassuringly solid in the hand. Its bold, rectangular shape gives it a classy, timeless appearance, and its sealed, water-resistant construction makes using it in the rain perfectly safe. Mind you, this is not a phone that would impress the demographics who don't know what a pager was. However, it would be a good fit for the inside pocket of a gentleman's business suit. By the way, the phone should survive at least one corner drop on the pavement from a pocket height. Make a guess how we know. On the topic of design, while we're willing to accept the Xperia XZ1 as it is, we can't deny the fact that it has an old-fashioned flavor to it. We're currently witnessing a shift in the industry – one paving the way toward bezelless, all- screen smartphone designs; one lead by well-known names like LG, Samsung , and Apple. One glaring issue with the Xperia XZ1 is that its fingerprint scanner – embedded in the power button on the right – is disabled on the US model. Sony has yet to disclose the exact reasons behind this decision, but in any case , the lack of a fingerprint scanner on a $650 phone is inexcusable. Luckily, our review unit has a functioning fingerprint scanner, but while it gets the job done, it could have been executed better. One complaint that we have is that we can't just take a peek at our lock screen notifications – pressing the button to wake the phone automatically takes us to our home screen. For some reason, double-tap to wake the screen isn't an available option, even though it was present on previous Xperia phones. Display A vivid and detailed screen of a traditional aspect ratio gets the job done.. 5.83 x 2.87 x 0.29 inches. 148 x 73 x 7.4 mm. 5.45 x 2.65 x 0.29 inches. 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3 mm. 5.86 x 2.68 x 0.31 inches. 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm. 5.86 x 2.83 x 0.31 inches. 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. A 5.2-inch IPS-LCD screen with a classic, 16:9 aspect ratio adorns the Xperia XZ1's front side. Frankly, there's nothing bad to say about its qualities: the 1080p resolution is perfectly sufficient, colors look nice and vibrant, and outdoor visibility has never been an issue during our time spent with the phone. But again, phones like the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 put the available space to better use – through the use of “taller” aspect ratios, they fit considerably larger screens, thus more content, within the same handset dimensions. Our display measurements indicate that colors on the Xperia XZ1 are given a slight saturation boost. We're confident that most users wouldn't mind their appearance, but if color accuracy is imperative to you, feel free to switch to the so-called professional mode in the display settings menu. Support for HDR content is one of the Sony Xperia XZ1's highlights. If you have an Amazon Prime Video or Netflix account, you can stream HDR movies and shows to your XZ1. Support for YouTube’s HDR videos is not present at this time. One cool extra that Sony has thrown in is the so-called Glove Mode, which – you guessed it – lets you use the screen while wearing gloves. One thing that’s missing – a blue light filter for night-time use with less eye strain.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compare.

Even if it was like this, it is matter of market difference. Why you don't put as con that iPhone is more expensive in EU than USA? It is more logical con than yours for SONY?!?. It is hilarious also in pros: first phone with Android Oreo? What is that?. Who listen music on phone speakers? You must check the quality on headphones or external speaker to measure quality.

Sony needs to work hard on their design and camera. (Posts: 1007; Member since: 01 Sep 2015). posted on 09 Oct 2017, 09:23. I really love Sony's slim and boxy design with the rounded sides. They perfected the design sthat started with the XZ now that everything is metal. It's the best design out there imo, even with the big bezels.. (Posts: 306; Member since: 04 May 2017). posted on 09 Oct 2017, 15:10. G6 got 8.6, so 7.8 is not fair. OP5 got 8.2 , it is way worse phone..

(Posts: 164; Member since: 30 Oct 2015). posted on 09 Oct 2017, 10:49. I think the two reason that makes this rating into 7.8 points only are the fact that it was not offered by any carrier in the US and it lacks the finger print sensor there. Otherwise, it will be unfair compared to iPhone 8 which is a bit pricey for similar design and no headphone jack which is more important for people like me who loves music than OIS on camera..

For example: It has a 3.5mm headphone jack and iPhone 8 doesn't, less bezels than iPhone 8, ip68 against ip67, full hd Hdr screen against hd no hdr, frontal-facing stereo speakers, 960fps, 3d creator, cheaper, better fingerprint placement, smoother and faster, bigger battery and iPhone scores 9.2. (Posts: 2180; Member since: 06 Aug 2014). posted on 09 Oct 2017, 14:56. Because specs aren't everything but I agree that iPhones are overrated despite the fact that I'm using one. Apple should be glorified for using the same exact design for 4 years in a row, for ditching things that are important for consumers like headphone jack and for using their own connector type. For these cons alone iPhone should not get higher ratings than 8.0 but we all knows how it is on sites like PA. Just don't care about ratings, read whole review and decide for yourself as scores on PA are clearly biased. (Posts: 12; Member since: 20 Aug 2017). posted on 09 Oct 2017, 16:24. And it's not, by the way Xperia phone are too much optimized, and the performance is so fast and smooth. This phone deserve way more than a 7.8, maybe a 8.7 like XZ Premium ou 8.8.. (Posts: 164; Member since: 30 Oct 2015). posted on 09 Oct 2017, 16:36. This is business and they have to earn too just like us. If sony wants to have a very good review of their phones they have to be generous too just like apple. It's their job to review phones based on their opinion as a reviewer and we can't blame them for that. I think the reason why there's a comment section for this website is for the users to refute or agree on the reviewer's views or opinion based on the users experience. I wish that PA had a portion for users experience rating so that buyers who came to this site have enough basis for choosing a phone by weighing the reviewer's view and consumers experience. A consumers rating based on some established parameters like display, battery, etc. Wherein you can rate from 1-10 same with the manner of rating that PA is giving to phones they reviewed.. (Posts: 161; Member since: 31 Jul 2012). posted on 09 Oct 2017, 19:36. I honestly wish Sony would use a more narrow lens for fewer distortion issues. You can't use clip-on super wide lenses too. But at least the XZ1 has less camera cons than previous PA reviews.. (Posts: 298; Member since: 19 Dec 2013). posted on 10 Oct 2017, 01:14. I'm more interested in the Compact. (Posts: 4; Member since: 14 Apr 2014). posted on 09 Jan 2018, 14:42. Almost non of those cons are important for someone outside of the US. We can find the phone anywhere with most carriers. The first review on both XZ1 Compact and this one, that complain on the sound of the speakers? Havent heard that in other reviews that I think actually said it was much improved and much better. And its the same speakers as my compact and they sounds great. I heard many other and no one has a better sound. And when it comes to camera I can agree that software has much to desire, and needs a improvment because Sony camera can handle better. So again, another review that in a sense has no real issue to talk about, just supperficial.. * Some comments have been hidden, because they don't meet the discussions rules.. Want to comment?

Display and Performance [ edit ]. Audio and Connectivity [ edit ]. The Sony Xperia XZ1 is an Android smartphone manufactured and marketed by Sony. Part of the Xperia X series, the device was announced to the public along with the Xperia XZ1 Compact at the annual IFA 2017 in August 31, 2017. [1] It is the direct successor to the Sony Xperia XZ according to Sony, and is the latest flagship after the Xperia XZ Premium .. The Xperia XZ1, along with the Xperia XZ1 Compact, were recognized as the first Android smartphones to come with the recently-launched Android 8.0 Oreo operating system pre-installed. [2] Its highlight features are the HDR -enabled 5.2" FHD IPS display and a new world's-first-in-a-smartphone 3D-modelling feature that doesn't need a dual camera setup. 1.1 Design and Build. 1.2 Display and Performance. 1.5 Audio and Connectivity. Sony refreshes the trademark Xperia Loop Surface design for the Xperia XZ1. But instead of using glass surfaces like the Xperia XZ Premium, the XZ1 is mostly consisted of a wraparound metal chassis, making up the back and sides of the device, with subtly-curved nylon top and bottom edges giving a more smoother approach to the overall design. The most defining change in the XZ1 as well as the XZ Premium is the placement of the image sensors at the back. It is now arranged across the camera lens, centered along the top, as opposed to being longitudinally placed below the lens like on the XZs. But unlike the XZ Premium which has a glass back panel, on the XZ1, the NFC antenna is housed alongside the image sensors, placed directly at the center of the glass window. A durable scratch-resistant glass panel made of Corning's Gorilla Glass 5 [4] adorns the front of the device. Dual front-firing stereo speakers with Sony's new S-Force Front Surround stereo, producing 50% more sound pressure than previous Xperia models for a more immersive surround sound, along with a 13 MP front camera, ambient light and proximity sensor and a notification LED make up the Xperia XZ1's front panel.. The Xperia XZ1's dimensions are 148. in) in height, with a width of 73.4. in) and a depth of 7.4. [5] It has an IP rating of IP65/68, making it dust-proof and water resistant for over 1.5 meters and 30 minutes. The device also features a fingerprint sensor embedded into the power button that can be used to unlock the phone and secure it from unauthorized access. This feature, however, is disabled on units sold in the US. The Xperia XZ1 is one of the first smartphones with an HDR display. But unlike the Xperia XZ Premium, the Xperia XZ1 abandons the 4K QHD resolution, settling for a 1080p FHD display instead. It is HDR10 compliant just like the XZ Premium, but has no Dolby Vision support. mm) IPS LCD screen has a pixel density of 424 ppi and features Sony's TRILUMINOS display and X-Reality for mobile technology.. It is powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (MSM8998) found in the Xperia XZ Premium, [7] built on 10 nm process technology with 8 custom Kryo processors (4x 2.35 GHz and 4x 1.9 GHz ), 4 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and uses the Adreno 540 for graphics rendering. The device also has an internal storage of 64 GB and comes in single-SIM and dual-SIM versions, with both featuring LTE Cat. 16 with Gigabit-class speeds, a 4x4 MIMO antenna design and a total of 8 antennas. It also has microSD card expansion of up to 256 GB (in a hybrid slot for the dual-SIM variant).. Sony debuted in the Xperia XZs and the XZ Premium the world's first three-layer stacked image sensor with DRAM for smartphones. [8] Known as the Sony IMX400 , the sensor features a RAM chip sandwiched in between the sensor and control circuitry layers which serves as a large and fast buffer to where the sensor can temporarily offload a significant amount of captured data before transferring it to the phone's internal memory for processing. [9] This enables the camera to record super slow-motion videos at 960. fps , at a steady 720p resolution. Recording at super slow motion is limited to 0.18 seconds per buffer though, due to limitations.. The Xperia XZ1 borrows the Motion Eye Camera from the Xperia XZ Premium and XZs. MP 1/2.3” Exmor RS for mobile sensor with a 1.22. μm pixel pitch, f/2.0 aperture and 25. It also features 4K video recording, which supports SteadyShot video stabilization alongside the standard 1080p/30. The front selfie camera has a 13-megapixel sensor (1/3.06") with 22. mm, f/2.0 lens, a 90-degree wide angle lens and SteadyShot with Intelligent Active Mode (5-axis stabilization ).. The Xperia XZ1 has the Triple Image Sensing technology that started with the Xperia XZ as standard. It is composed of the image sensing ( CMOS sensor with PDAF), distance sensing ( Laser AF sensor ) and color sensing ( RGBC-IR sensor) systems, featuring a hybrid autofocus that utilizes Phase Detection (PDAF) to lock focus on a subject within 0.03 seconds, and also includes phase and contrast detection along with predictive motion tracking. It also has a laser autofocus sensor for fast tracking and locking focus on a subject, as well as an RGBC-IR ( R ed G reen B lue C lear- I nfra R ed ) color sensor that assists the white balance function of the camera by providing additional data about the light conditions of the surrounding environment. It also has SteadyShot with Intelligent Auto in addition to the five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization first seen in the Xperia XZ. The Motion Eye Camera in the Xperia XZ1 also has Predictive Capture. When it detects fast-paced movement, the camera automatically captures a maximum of four photos before the shutter button is pressed, and lets the user select the best one afterwards. This is done without any user intervention and is possible due to the same built-in RAM chip on the image sensor used in capturing the 960. The newest addition to the Motion Eye Camera of the Xperia XZ1 is the capability of capturing 3D objects without the need of a dual-camera setup, a world first for Sony. [ citation needed ] It utilizes the IMX400's built-in DRAM to offload captured data before being combined and built up in the proprietary 3D Creator application, creating a near-perfect rendition of the subject, [ citation needed ] be it a face of a person, a whole head or any object the user may wish to capture. The user is then given the option to use the rendered 3D image on the included animated figures for a more creative approach or have it 3D-printed by Sony's approved 3D printing companies, all within the app itself.. The Xperia XZ1 is powered by a non-removable 2700 mAh battery. Charging and data transfer is handled by a USB-C port with support for USB 3.1. It also has Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0 and Qnovo adaptive charging technology built-in. This allows the device to monitor the cell's electrochemical processes in real time and adjust charging parameters accordingly to minimize cell damage and extend the battery unit's lifespan. [10] It also comes with Battery Care, a Sony proprietary feature, that controls the charging process of the phone by learning and recognizing the user's charging patterns, preventing the phone from damaging the battery's cells from excessive heat due to overcharging. For example, when charging overnight, Battery Care stops the initial charge to 90 percent and then continue charging until full where it left off the next day.. The Xperia XZ1 comes with a standard 3.5 mm audio jack for plugging in wired headphones. It also has improved LDAC , an audio coding technology developed by Sony [11] , that enables the transmission of 24bit/96khz High-Resolution (Hi-Res) audio content over Bluetooth at up to 990 kbit/s, three times faster than conventional audio streaming codecs, to compatible audio devices. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 5 with aptX and Low Energy , NFC , dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with 2x2 MIMO antennas, Wi-Fi Direct , MirrorLink , screen casting via Miracast , Google Cast , DLNA , GPS (with A-GPS ), GLONASS , BeiDou and Galileo satellite positioning. Like most flagships today, the Xperia XZ1 has no FM radio support.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 is the first smartphone to launch with Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box, along with Sony's famed minimalist approach to customizing its interface, Smart Stamina battery saving modes and multimedia apps.. ^ Nirave Gondhia (31 August 2017).

Lots of RAM (4 GB RAM). The Xperia XZ1 is Sony’s latest attempt at capturing the high-end smartphone market. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC and 4 GB of RAM put it square inside flagship territory, while the ability to capture 960 fps video and scan 3D objects with the 19 MP MotionEye camera is designed to appease photography enthusiasts. Its visual design closely follows that of past Sony devices, but refines it with a high-quality aluminum build. It also has the honor of being the first smartphone to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box.. Sony Xperia XZ1 Review Sony Xperia XZ1 manual Sony Xperia XZ1 benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.83 x 2.87 x 0.29 inches (148 x 73 x 7.4 mm). Weight: 5.50 oz (156 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). IP certified - The IP code indicates the degree of protection against dust and water. The first number represents dust protection, while the second represents water protection. In IP67, for example, 6 means a completely dust-tight device, while 7 means the device can stay immersed in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes. In IP68, a higher level of water protection is expected, but exact numbers aren't specified: both depth and continuance are specified by the manufacturer on per device basis.. Display Physical size: 5.2 inches. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: HDR video support, Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 5), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus (Laser, Phase detection). Software Features: Manual focus, Object tracking, Digital image stabilization, Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging.

Features: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Object tracking, Picture-taking during video recording, Digital image stabilization, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2450 MHz, Kryo 280, 64-bit, 10 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 11.30 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min).

What is the Sony Xperia XZ1?. The Sony Xperia XZ1 is a high-end phone, but not in the same vein as the iPhone X or Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Although it has top specs, it actually seems a little ordinary next to some of the best from Samsung, LG and even Honor.. There isn’t much wrong with the Sony Xperia XZ1 beyond a few niggles. However, when phones such as the Honor 9 and OnePlus 5 offer similar quality for £200 less, it’s hard to get excited about this handset – particularly when its newest feature is the fun but largely useless 3D face scanning.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 looks and feels pretty similar to the Xperia XZ. At arm’s length it would be impossible to tell the difference.. However, this is actually a higher-end phone, featuring elements of the even pricier Xperia XZ Premium. The Xperia XZ1’s back and sides are all-metal. The aluminium rear curves around to form the sides, with no seams or splits to be seen. While this might not appear something to boast about in a £600 phone, it’s a step up for the series.. The top and bottom ends of the handset are plastic. It took me a while to work out that they weren’t metal, because the material doesn’t feel like bog-standard plastic; it appears to be more like the glass-fibre reinforced plastic as seen on the Xperia XZ1 Compact.. Related: Google Pixel 2 – everything you need to know. While the XZ1 doesn’t quite have the wow factor of the shiny Honor 9 or curvy Samsung Galaxy S8, this is definitely a smart-looking phone. My issue with the design is that, like every other Xperia, it feels rather large for its screen size. Its overall dimensions are pretty similar to those of the OnePlus 5, which has a 5.5-inch screen. The Xperia XZ1 has a 5.2-inch display. It’s thinner than the Xperia XZ at 7.4mm thick, but it remains wide.. Parts to celebrate include Gorilla Glass 5 on top of the screen and IP58 water-resistance, which means it should survive an accidental dunk in the water. You also get 64GB storage and the option of a microSD card – there’s a slot under the pull-out flap on the Xperia XZ1’s side.. As already mentioned, the Sony Xperia XZ1 has a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS LCD screen. It isn’t as sharp as the Samsung Galaxy S8, but the only image quality quibble I have is that close-up, there’s appear to be some ultra-fine ‘diagonal line’ patterns visible on blocks of white. This isn’t down to a lack of pixels, but another layer in the display. You also don’t quite get the perfect contrast of an OLED display. However, you’ll only notice if you’re using the XZ1 with the brightness ramped up in a dimly-lit room. Sony’s top LCDs do actually get pretty close to the perceptual benefits of OLED..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. This is particularly true of colour saturation. If you like, it’s possible to make the Sony Xperia XZ1 look extremely saturated, with both turbo-charged colour and increased contrast.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 has three display modes: Super-vivid is too rich for my tastes; but both Standard and Professional look great. Professional is a strict sRGB mode. It will look a little undersaturated to most eyes, but is the best one to use to ensure photos look the same on the screen as they do on your laptop.. The Auto Backlight mode is jittery, however. It flickers up and down rather than doing so smoothly. I’ve found it a little distracting when reading an article on the train. Go through a tunnel and the Xperia XZ1 looks like it’s having a breakdown. Let’s hope Sony fixes this with an update.. Like the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, the XZ1 also supports HDR content. This is video designed to make use of displays with very high contrast and a wide colour gamut. Using Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, you’ll see punchier colour in HDR video.. However, in ‘pitch black’ cinema conditions I’d still prefer to watch a non-HDR OLED than an HDR LCD. The unlikeliness of this is the reason I don’t put great stock in technology such as phone HDR as a top reason to buy.. When I watch a video on a phone for longer than a few minutes, it’s always in an image quality-compromised environment. Stuck on a train for four hours, I’d much rather watch a film on a good 6-inch screen than a great 5.2-inch one.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 is one of the first phones to launch with Android 8.0. There’s still a Sony interface layered on top, but there are a couple of new features that stand out.. These are little coloured circles that pop-up over app icons when, for example, you receive an email. It makes your homescreen more of a ‘desktop’, providing a quick way to see what’s going on without pulling down the notifications dropdown.. The notifications bar also feels different here. Once there are more than a few notifications, you’ll see small icons at the bottom, indicating that there are others that don’t quite fit on the screen. These pop up properly as you flick up. Android 8.0’s notifications have more fun feel than before.. New Android features aside, the Sony Xperia XZ1’s software looks much like that of other recent Xperia phones. The apps menu is arranged as horizontally scrolling pages rather than a vertical feed, and Sony’s apps sit alongside the Google suite. There are apps for music, watching video and to hook up with PlayStation network. Sony has also preinstalled ebook store Kobo and the AVG virus scanner. You can’t delete them, but you can ‘disable’ them.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 also has a ‘recommendations’ section, accessed by swiping left-to-right from the apps menu. This is really just a list of app links to Google Play. Unless you’re a brand-new phone user, it’s unlikely to be of much use.. This part can be switched off, however..

It's fast, fun, and has Android 8.0, but Sony's Xperia ZX1 needs a new design. The Sony Xperia XZ1 offers excellent performance, Android 8.0 Oreo, and fun camera features..

Super slow motion video is fun. Geekbench 4: 1,836 (single-core), 6,508 (multi-core). A good display, and daylong battery. The camera to end all cameras? Not quite. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. The Xperia XZ1 is similar to Sony’s earlier 2017 flagship, the Xperia XZ Premium. It has the same, excellent camera that can shoot super slow motion videos at an impressive 960 frames per second. It has almost everything you’d want in a smartphone, and in our review, we see if it’s worth your money among the intense competition.. It’s been some time since a Sony phone was hailed for design, and it will likely stay like that until 2018. Sony has been reusing the same design theme for the past four years, and nothing’s different with the Xperia XZ1.. The smartphone trend of the year is the “ bezel-less ” design. It’s where the edges flanking the screen are as small as possible for a truly immersive experience, such as the Galaxy Note 8 , the LG V30 , and the iPhone X. You end up getting a larger screen, in a smaller frame. You won’t find an edge-to-edge display here, as Sony is sticking with a somewhat large forehead and chin on this device — the result looks dated.. Like other Sony phones, the XZ1 sports a sharp rectangular design. It’s different from other phones on the market that opt for rounded corners and an overall softer look. The back is incredibly minimal, which we like. The camera sits on the top left corner with a slight bump, and the Xperia logo is in the middle.. The left edge of the phone is where you’ll find the SIM and MicroSD card slot, which is a little finicky. Ours eventually broke on the Xperia XZ Premium, so we imagine the one on the XZ1 will be just as fragile. The good thing is you don’t need a SIM card removal tool — just a long fingernail that can dig in.. Sony has been reusing the same design theme for the past four years.. On the right is the power button, volume rocker, and a camera button. We always like to see dedicated shutter buttons, and wish more manufacturers added them in. On the XZ1, you can immediately launch the camera by pressing the button and use it to capture photos and videos. The power button is indented — it doesn’t stick out like traditional buttons. On the top, you might be pleased to know there’s a headphone jack.. You may have noticed something missing missing: There’s no fingerprint sensor. Sony has long-claimed the reason it doesn’t have a fingerprint sensor is a “business decision.” It’s puzzling, because you can find the sensor on the international models of these Xperia phones. The lack of a fingerprint sensor is inconvenient, especially since you can use it to unlock banking and other security sensitive apps. You’ll have to stick with a PIN or swipe pattern here.. We do like the XZ1’s design — the back is minimal and attractive, but the front looks dated due to the chunky edges around the screen. If you’re looking for something new in Sony design, wait until next year. we can expect to see a visual refresh in 2018, and hopefully it includes a fingerprint sensor.. You’ll hardly have any issues with the Sony Xperia XZ1’s performance. It’s responsive and snappy, apps load quickly, and we didn’t have problems when multitasking. It was able to handle graphic-intensive games, like Asphalt 8 , extremely well, and the only stutter we saw was when it tried to load an ad in the game’s menu.. The smooth performance is all thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, which is the same chip you’ll find powering most Android handsets of 2017, including the Galaxy S8 Plus , and the Pixel 2 .. Let’s take a look at those Benchmark scores:. These benchmark scores are quite good, as the XZ1 managed to beat out other high-end phones like the Samsung Galaxy S8, which scored 155,253 in its AnTuTu test. Naturally, it didn’t come close to the iPhone 8, which scored a massive 214,492 on AnTuTu. Benchmarks aren’t the be-all end-all of performance though, so don’t rely on it too much.. You’ll find 4GB of RAM, which helps with multitasking, and 64GB of internal storage should be plenty for most people. The MicroSD card slot means you can expand that storage up to 256GB if you need more space.. At 5.2-inches, the Xperia XZ1 is smaller than your average flagship smartphone, and its size means you definitely don’t need a super high resolution like the Note 8’s 2960 x 1440-pixels. Instead the XZ1 has a Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) pixel resolution. The LCD screen is sharp and bright, but colors aren’t as vibrant and the blacks aren’t as deep as the AMOLED screen on our Google Pixel XL .. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compared To. The 2,700mAh battery is small, but the phone managed to last a day in our tests. You’ll want to make sure that you charge the phone daily, but at least there’s support for Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 — that means you can get quite a bit of juice after a short charging time.. One of the main selling points of the Xperia XZ1 is its camera. The rear camera packs 19 megapixels and a f/2.0 aperture, electronic image stabilization, and predictive phase detection and laser autofocus. The spotlight is on videos over photos, because the killer feature is the ability to capture slow motion videos at 960 frames per second at 720p. That means you can slow down incredibly high-speed movement. Apple’s iPhone 8 Plus can do slow-motion video of 240fps at 1,080p, which isn’t as slow as the XZ1.. It’s a fun feature, but it can be pretty tricky to use.To use super slow-mo, you’ll first start recording video, then you’ll hit the “super slo-mo” button at the exact moment that you want, after which it’ll start filming at 960 frames per second. The camera only takes slow-motion footage for a few seconds, which means you have to time it all perfectly or you’ll miss the action. It works best in bright daylight, which can be a little limiting, and we would have liked to see a 1,080p resolution — maybe next year.. When it comes to taking photos, we compared the XZ1 closely to the Google Pixel as we had it on hand. Images weren’t as sharp as those taken by the Pixel, and colors weren’t as saturated — to be fair, the Pixel tends to oversaturate images. We had quite a bit of trouble with the XZ1’s focus: The Pixel was able to latch onto objects and people quickly and easily, but the XZ1 kept shifting focus. The camera’s results are best with landscape shots, which are well detailed with accurate colors.. In low light, the Xperia XZ1 largely could not produce many usable photos.. In low light, the Xperia XZ1 largely could not produce many usable photos. You may be able to achieve better results using the camera’s manual mode and tweak settings, but we were a little disappointed with the results from the automatic mode.. There are some other nifty features in the camera, such as “predictive phase detection autofocus.” It keeps the focus on a moving object and takes a burst of photos. For example, if you wanted to take photos of the front of a train pulling into a station, the XZ1 can keep the focus on the front of the train as it moves closer and closer. This worked pretty well, and while one or two photos were still blurry, we were always able to find great shots within the cluster.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 is built around offering a great camera experience, but so far its best attributes aren’t exactly necessary. We like the object tracking focus and the super slow motion, but an overall improved photography-experience would have been preferred.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 is one of the first devices to ship with Google’s latest and greatest operating system, Android 8.0 Oreo, but Sony has tweaked it heavily for a custom experience.. It’s not a bad-looking theme, but we definitely could have done without the pre-installed apps – and there are plenty of them. From Google-replacement apps, like “Album,” and “News,” to other apps like the PlayStation app, the bloatware is serious on this phone. These extra apps sit next to Google’s ones, so you’re sometimes stuck with two of the same app.. What makes the XZ1 unique is 3D Creator, which allows you to create 3D scans of faces, food, and so on. You can have these scans printed if you own a 3D printer, and if you don’t you can send them to a third-party service straight from the app itself. We found the 3D scanner to be a little tricky to use, and you’ll want both a steady hand and a steady model – but in the end it can produce some cool effects. We like it, but we don’t think it’s going to be popular or widely-used. In general, the software works fine and was responsive, though a little cluttered. If you’re looking for a pure, simple Android experience, look to an HTC, Google, or Motorola phone.. Sony offers a one year limited warranty on the Xperia XZ1, which covers failure under normal use and factory defects. It’s important to note that it does not cover standard phone wear and tear or cases of user errors – including accidental damage or dropping your phone in the pool. The phone does offer an IP68 rating – which should allow it to withstand up to 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes.. The Xperia XZ1 is available now on Amazon , but you should know it is only supported on GSM networks such as T-Mobile and AT&T. It does not work on Verizon and Sprint. It costs $700, though it’s already discounted to $650 for some colors.. It can be easy to forget about Sony in the smartphone world. While players like Apple , Samsung , and more recently Google , but you should know it is only supported on GSM networks such as T-Mobile and AT&T. It does not work on Verizon and Sprint. It costs $700, though it’s already discounted to $650 for some colors.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 is a good phone. It offers excellent performance and ships with the latest Android 8.0 Oreo. While some of its camera features are little gimmicky, we did enjoy playing around with them, especially the Super Slo-mo. For the price, we expect the camera to be better for photography, and the dated design, lack of a fingerprint sensor, and bloatware and unnecessary blights.. If you’re a Sony phone enthusiast, we recommend waiting until next year. The company said it will introduce a refreshed design ethos for 2018, and we’re optimistic it’ll pull out something interesting.. The Samsung Galaxy S8 offers a modern design, excellent camera, and beautiful display. It also keeps the great performance offered by the Xperia XZ1 thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, and it’s slightly cheaper on Amazon right now at $625.. You can even go for a the first-generation Google Pixel , which is now $550 on the Google Store, or the HTC U11 .. The phone performs well, so its performance should hold for at least the next two years. The IP68 water- and dust-resistance rating gives added durability, and there’s no glass on the back so there’s less of a chance to break the phone. We expect two to three years of use here, more if you take care of the phone.. You get good performance, a capable camera with fun features, daylong battery life, and a good display. It’s a little too expensive for what it offers though, and there’s easily better competition. Buy it if you really love taking slow motion videos.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

Sony Xperia XZ1 review: Solid, opinionated, and lovably flawed. We've seen it all before, yet our interest is still piqued.. Sony Xperia XZ1 Tech Specs. Sony's Xperia XZ1 once again offers lustworthy design and hardware quality that focuses on style rather than ergonomics and screen-to-body ratios, and it absolutely works. With top-tier specs, the Android 8.0 software absolutely screams — and despite having a small battery, longevity is excellent. But for a $699 phone, the XZ1's 1080p screen is just average, and its camera still doesn't match the similarly priced competition.. No fingerprint sensor in the U.S.. 5.2-inch LCD, 1920x1080 Gorilla Glass 5. 19MP Exmor RS, hybrid AF 960 fps slow-mo, 4K video. Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC, USB 3.1, GPS 1Gbps (Cat16) LTE. USB-C Quick Charge 3.0 Qnovo Adaptive Charging. 148 x 73.4 x 7.4 mm. Black, Warm Silver, Moonlit Blue, Venus Pink. Sony Xperia XZ1 Things you'll love. You can always pick a Sony phone out from a crowd. (Doubly so when you have a pink Sony phone, as I do here.) That opinionated, bold design is a big selling point of Sony phones, knowing that you have a phone that will get looks wherever you go — particularly in the U.S. where so few Sony phones are out there in the wild. Some may not like that, but I see it as a huge positive. I love how the Xperia XZ1 looks.. Good or bad, everyone has an opinion on Sony's design.. And the quality of its build matches the design. The metal body is sleek and just lightly textured, perfectly rounding up to the sides to meet the front glass. It's fantastic, and easy to manage even though it's perfectly flat across the back. This isn't the "Compact" model, but with a 5.2-inch display and at 155 grams it's much lighter and more comfortable to hold than the big slab that is the XZ Premium. Though of course the screen is much smaller than the competition, its overall size is roughly the same as the Galaxy S8 — that's "small" today.. The power button is perfectly situated for your thumb, and the volume rocker is easy to press. There's a dedicated camera button, if you like that sort of thing. There's a headphone jack(!), and even a pair of front-facing stereo speakers — which sound good, by the way, even if they aren't on the same level as the pseudo-stereo speakers of the HTC U11. The big bezels, while not necessarily in vogue at the moment, give you plenty of room to comfortably hold the phone in landscape for video.. Sony packs serious specs into what is a relatively small phone.. Sony backs up the XZ1's good looks with some great specs and performance. A Snapdragon 835, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage with an SD card slot is a great base to work on, particularly when you consider it's pushing just 1080p resolution on the screen. You get all of the latest radios, including NFC placed properly on the back of the phone, and it's all wrapped up in IP68 water- and dust-resistance.. The specs interface wonderfully with Android 8.0 Oreo , which puts the XZ1 in some very exclusive company at the time of launch. The software absolutely flies in every single way. No hiccups, no lag, no stutters, no dropped frames or complains. It's not that I wasn't expecting exactly this, but actually using it and having a great time is always worth reporting on.. Android 8.0 Oreo flies with these specs, and battery life is great as well.. Sony's interface itself hasn't really changed much from Nougat to Oreo, as you'd expect, but that's just fine with me. A few of its apps could use a face lift, and its launcher (somehow) doesn't properly integrate with notification dots, but Sony continues to offer one of the least intrusive manufacturer software suites. You get all of the benefits of having Oreo underneath, which will suit you well now and in the future, and Sony always seems willing to follow Google's playbook — case in point being the Google Now feed in the default launcher.. Sony somehow continues to get ridiculous battery life out of phones with below-average battery capacities. The 2700mAh on tap in the XZ1 seems small, even by this screen size, yet I never had to worry about battery life. I ended my average 17-hour day off the charger with 30-40% left on the phone, even with 2-3 hours of "screen on" time. A heavier day with over 4 hours of screen on time still got me to bed before hitting Stamina Mode at 15% battery. It's long and consistent — that's awesome.. Sony Xperia XZ1 Things you'll hate. Some people just won't be able to deal with buying an expensive phone that doesn't give them a high amount of screen real estate per dollar. At $699 with a 5.2-inch screen, the Xperia XZ1 doesn't offer the same sort of value as a Galaxy S8+ at roughly the same price. Sony isn't even trying to play the "small bezel" game, and if that's what you want, you just need to look elsewhere.. The 'right' screen size is subjective, but the quality here is objectively not good enough.. But there are bigger concerns with the screen when it comes to its overall quality. The fact that it's 1920x1080 isn't a huge issue at this size, though you will notice the resolution from time to time when you get your face closer to the screen than usual. The bigger issue is that this is just an average LCD. It's both accurate and colorful when it needs to be, and viewing angles are fantastic, but it doesn't get particularly bright, which limits its usefulness in sunlight. It also doesn't get particularly dim, so it can be tough on your eyes late at night.. Once again making a comparison to Samsung's latest phones at the same price level ... the screen isn't in the same league. Or comparing directly to an LCD, like the HTC U11 's, the XZ1 doesn't match it.. I have so many extra feelings on the XZ1's camera I actually wrote a whole separate article about what's improved. But here's the short(er) version: Sony has dramatically improved its image processing with the XZ1, to the point where you wonder what the heck it was thinking on previous phones. Rather than crush fine lines and details into a muddy mess, the XZ1 now lets far more of the detail come through so you get crisp, realistic photos.. More: The Sony Xperia XZ1's camera has pleasantly surprised me. It's Sony's best camera in years ... and it's still not matching the competition.. The camera is still begging to add OIS to improve its low light photos, and there are some areas where the XZ1 still doesn't meter properly and has to over-process dark areas. But those are more of fringe issues now, as Sony has upped its game to the point where walking out of the house with the XZ1 didn't feel like a massive downgrade from the other great cameras I have available to me. But alas, this is a $699 phone. Its camera altogether doesn't meet its price, notably still beaten overall by phones like the Galaxy S8 , HTC U11 , etc. — but this is Sony's best camera in several generations.. And of course, the anchor for this section is a few sentences addressing the fingerprint sensor. Mainly, you don't get one if you buy this phone in the U.S. Not because the hardware isn't there, but because of a legal situation keeping Sony from enabling it in the firmware. It's a ridiculous limitation, and we're tired of prattling on about it, but this issue alone will keep many people from buying the XZ1. Yes you can import a phone from the UK, or even flash UK firmware to a U.S. phone to get the sensor — but should you have to? No, Sony should just remedy whatever it got itself into that keeps the fingerprint sensor disabled on U.S. It's insane that we're still talking about this today.. Sony Xperia XZ1 Should you buy it?. Once again, Sony has made a phone that appeals to your heart rather than your brain. Looking at it, holding it in your hands and using it every day, you'll love so many aspects of the Xperia XZ1. But then you realize what it costs and what you can get elsewhere ... and you may think better of that decision to spend $699 on this phone.. Sometimes you buy the phone that's objectively the best. Other times, you buy a Sony.. Sony's hardware is beautiful and unique, despite its unabashedly large screen bezels. The XZ1's build quality is top-notch, as are its internal specs. You get Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box, and it runs perfectly — and runs all day on a charge despite not having a large capacity battery to draw from.. And for that money, you're getting a 5.2-inch 1080p LCD that's just average. And a camera, while much improved from its predecessors, that doesn't match the competition in the same price range. And in the U.S., you're not even getting a fingerprint sensor. When you take in those downsides, it's a tough sell for the rational consumer. But then again, how often do we act completely rationally? Sometimes you have to listen to your heart. Sometimes, you buy a Sony phone..

The Xperia XZ1 Compact is the latest in a line of industry-leading compact smartphones from Sony. Like the larger Xperia XZ1, the XZ1 Compact contains the state-of-the-art Motion Eye camera system, making it the first smartphone of its size to have the capability to shoot Super slow motion videos at 960 fps. A new feature of the Motion Eye camera on the XZ1 Compact is motion-tracking burst that rapidly captures continuous motion at 10 fps while still in focus at 19MP resolution. The updated camera also introduces an innovative 3D scanning technology that captures high-resolution 3D models straight to the device and outputs them directly to a 3D printer and other 3D applications. The 8MP front-facing camera comes with a super-wide-angle 12mm lens and display flash. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, the XZ1 Compact is one of the first devices to ship with Android Oreo, the latest major Android update. It features a 4.6” HD display encased in a durable reinforced glass fiber body and has an IP 65/68 dust and water resistance rating —an improvement over its predecessor. It also comes with a host of the latest Sony audio innovations, including SmartAmp (which prevents speaker degradation over time), High Resolution Audio, and S-Force Front Surround Sound. With its premium features, such as the significantly enhanced Motion Eye camera system, HD display, Snapdragon 835 processor, and superior audio capabilities, the Xperia XZ1 Compact delivers the power of a flagship smartphone packaged in a durable pocket-sized design.. 5 x 0.3 x 2.5 inches. 13.6 ounces ( View shipping rates and policies ). #12,121 in Cell Phones & Accessories ( See Top 100 in Cell Phones & Accessories ). #219 in Cell Phones & Accessories > Unlocked Cell Phones.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 2.0 out of 5 stars Would have been great if it received timely updates.. TL;DR: If you are on T-Mobile and choosing between XZ1 and XZ1 Compact, go with the Compact one, but if you value updates over T-Mobile VoWiFi and VoLTE, you may want to go with the bigger XZ1. If you want both timely software updates and T-Mobile support, look elsewhere. This is XPERIA XZ1 G8441, product lilac_us_ss, Customization Version 1310-4371_R8B, which is an unlocked US version. As of January 13 2018, this device runs August 5 2017 Android security patch level in US, while other regions got December 2017 updates. It is missing 4 Android Security Bulletin updates already, so it is vulnerable to Blueborne (attacks over bluetooth), KRACK (decrypting WPA2 traffic through MitM attack), Janus (disguising malware as a legitimate software update), Meltdown, and Spectre (enables applications reading memory they are not supposed to). This device is a smaller version of XZ1, so reviews of. have most of the things covered: • US version has customized firmware (lilac_us_ss), which does not have fingerprint sensor support, even though hardware is there. • This phone launched with Android Oreo, so has Project Treble support, which should make it easier to keep this phone updated. There are differences, though: Screen quality: The screen here has a resolution of 1280x720 at 4.6" which resolves to around 320 pixels per inch. While I thought that low-res screen will be an eyesore, it turns out that 320 ppi is quite good, in fact, iPhone 8 has 326 ppi. Unfortunately, the screen refresh rate is a bit low, so scrolling text exhibits ghosting. I did not see any issues with video content. Sharp corners: You'll want to get a case, not only to protect the phone from you, but also to protect you from the phone. The top and bottom panels are metal and have sharp edges, so they may cause uncomfortable feeling when you hold the device in your hand. This was happening on XZ1 to some degree, but it is more noticeable on the "boxier" XZ1 Compact. Frontal camera: When you are using Sony camera applications, you are given a choice of wide field of view (fisheye) or cropped normal field of view. Third-party applications can only use the cropped field of view. Heat dissipation: Since the back of the phone is some composite plastic thingie, you may experience the phone heating up during initial install/update. After CPU-intense operations complete, the phone is back cool to the touch. This suggests that handset thermal management may pose an issue if you are into high-CPU intensive applications. On the other hand, this plastic cover feels good in hand and I was ready to forego the case completely, but... T-Mobile Voice over WiFi (WiFi Calling, VoWiFi) and Voice over LTE (VoLTE): This is enough reason for me to tolerate ghosting screen as I spend quite a lot of time outside of T-Mobile coverage. Placing a call over WiFi with 0 cell bars feels like magic. On the VoLTE side, I was not able to get to a spot with only Band 12 LTE to check the behavior, but regular calls are routed over LTE if available, showing a "HD" icon and providing better sound if all parties support HD Voice. Things I like: • It is fast. • Headphone jack provides great sound with wired headphones. • Loud and clear stereo speakers. • Battery life is great, I was able to go through a whole day wihout a charge. • The phone is smaller than Nexus 5! • Screen changes colors when facing bright sunlight, making it easier to see things outside. • VoLTE and VoWiFi compatibility with T-Mobile! (which is not supported in bigger dual-sim XZ1). • Various useful adjustments in Android (such as automatic DnD mode when you are at work, or disable notification light at night). • Video quality is great, electronic stabilization and clear sound make videos pleasant to watch. Things I don't like: • US (update: severely) lags behind severely in security updates (-2 stars). • Camera performance is not as good as with the current flagships. Smaller pixels lose details and post-processing algorithms (that you can't turn off) like to sharpen image beyond repair (-1 star). • Icons shift back and forth in status bar on network activity, which is distracting. This is fixable with my "Disable Network Activity Indicator RRO" "app" on Google Play, though. Pros outweigh the cons for me at the moment, so I am happy with this purchase, but the lack of updates or any update schedule information from Sony prevents me from recommending this device to a wide audience. Accessories to consider: It is hard to find good accessories for XZ1 Compact, so finding a case or screen protector is challenging. I've tested a few items and can recommend: •. Skinomi TechSkin Full Coverage Screen Protector. - This is a "self-healing" film screen protector that's fairly easy to apply and it covers enough of glass area to provide decent protection from pocket sand particles. - This is so far the best soft TPU case I've seen for this phone which does not impact button operation.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Easy decision for T-Mobile customers. As many of you know, if you want a high-end compact flagship phone your options are very slim. At the time of writing, the only real competitors to this phone are older Sony phones and the iPhone SE. The iPhone SE isn't even a flagship and this iteration is definitely an improvement over previous models. The camera received a healthy upgrade as well as the SoC--we actually got the flagship SoC (Snap 835) this time around. I also appreciate the switch to a hard plastic back rather than glass that'll take one drop to shatter. I feel comfortable using this phone without a case. The other huge advantage is for T-Mobile customers--this phone is VoLTE and VoWiFi certified. You also receive "HD Voice" when using these options. The real question is: Assuming this form factor is a hard requirement, is the XZ1 compact worth the extra money over an X Compact? T-Mobile customers are likely to be more compelled spending almost twice as much over the X compact, but if you're using another carrier it's a tougher decision if the camera and SoC upgrades are really worth $300. If you're willing to get a bigger phone, there are many other models with comparable or better hardware that aren't as expensive.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent little phone. Final a Sony phone that works correctly on t mobile. Yes this does have WiFi calling and works with band 12 and volte. The actions are very snappy, as would be expected with this much ram and processing power. It's very comfortable in the hand. It is a little thicker many of the other options on the market right now, but that's the trade off to get flagship specs in a 4.6 inch screen. Design is a little square and chunky, but beauty of in the eye of the beholder. You either like it or you don't. I had the z3 compact, but had to give it to due to not working correctly on t mobile. Since then I've had the full size z3 and the htc 10. This in my opinion it way better. And even though the screen is only 720p. The screen is sharp and looks great. In not trying to watch movies on a 4.6 inch screen so i don't need 4k resolution. And since it is only 720p graphics actually perform faster because it don't use as much processing power. Guess my other Review got lost. I First ordered the Twilight Pink phone because I found a lot of review stating that the Pink was more orange than pink. From hands on first hand experience....it is not orange! not even a little. it is metallic pink, maybe salmon, but pink none the less.. Was this review helpful to you?.

PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page.. View All 9 Photos in Gallery. Small Android phone with powerful specs. With a 4.6-inch screen, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is the smallest, most powerful premium Android phone.. For years, we have been dreaming of a small, truly premium Android phone. Sony is bringing it to us. The Xperia XZ1 Compact ($599.99 unlocked) is the first sub-5-inch, no-compromise Android device in years. Along with its big sibling, the Xperia XZ1 , the Compact is positioned as the best one-handed phone for anyone into 3D printing, with a really cool 3D-scanning app that will eventually let you share 3D photos on Facebook. It's also powered by a screaming-fast Snapdragon 835 processor, making it the most powerful small Android phone you can get.. The XZ1 Compact isn't striking at first glance: It looks like just another little plastic-bodied Sony design (although it isn't plastic per se, but a sort of glass-infused polymer). It measures 5.1 by 2.5 by 0.4 inches (HWD) and weighs 4.9 ounces, so it's considerably smaller and slimmer than even narrow phones like the Samsung Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces), although it has a more traditional 16:9 screen aspect ratio. In that regard, it's more similar to the tiny iPhone SE (4.9 by 2.3 by 0.3 inches, 4.0 ounce), despite being just a tad bigger and heavier overall.. View All 9 Photos in Gallery. The phone fits comfortably into the hand and reaching across the screen or from top to bottom isn't a problem. It has the same button and port configuration as the XZ1, with a volume rocker, power button, and camera shutter on the right side. The left side has a SIM/microSD card slot that worked fine with a 256GB card. A 3.5mm headphone jack is up top, and a USB-C charging port is on the bottom. Like its larger sibling, the Compact is rated IP68, so it can survive in up to six feet of water for 30 minutes. Unfortunately, there's no fingerprint sensor in the US.. Left to right: Xperia XZ1, Xperia XZ1 Compact. Front and center is a 4.6-inch, 1,280-by-720 IPS display. That resolution is lower than most Android phones, but it's fine for the size, at 319 pixels per inch. That's not quite as pixel-dense as the 4-inch iPhone SE (326ppi), but the difference is academic. Text and graphics look fine, and there's no pixelation. Like the XZ1, the Compact has the same Triluminos display that gives it vibrant colors and customization options for color temperature, but HDR 10 is only supported on the larger model. Viewing angles and brightness are good, though the screen is reflective under direct sunlight.. The Compact supports GSM carriers, but LTE speeds are stopped down a bit lower than on the bigger phone. While the XZ1 can hit gigabit speeds on AT&T and T-Mobile, the XZ1 Compact is specced for 800Mbps. During our testing in midtown Manhattan, we experienced strong network connectivity on T-Mobile, with download and upload speeds ranging between 15Mbps to 20Mbps.. The phone supports Wi-Fi on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. There's also NFC, but because there's no fingerprint sensor you can't use it for Android Pay.. Sony has a long string of buzzwords to describe the phone's audio capabilities. The most important is probably AptX HD, which means you get crystal clear audio over Bluetooth 5.0 headphones and speakers. Testing it with the Bose QuietControl 30 for Bluetooth playback and Meze 99 Classics for wired listening delivered clear, crisp sound with rich bass. A pair of stereo speakers on the front give you loud audio with a good deal of depth.. The XZ1 Compact benefits from strong noise cancellation, resulting in clear transmissions free from background noise. Earpiece volume is loud, as is the speakerphone.. The XZ1 Compact has a Snapdragon 835 processor under the hood with 4GB of RAM, meaning this little phone doesn't make any compromises on power. In the AnTuTu benchmark, which measures overall system performance, it scored a solid 154,837.. That's a little surprising though, because the Snapdragon 835 paired with a 720p screen should eat benchmarks for breakfast, but the Compact fell slightly short of the XZ1 (165,553) and Galaxy S8 (173,609). We noticed it warming up a bit when running benchmarks and playing games, something we didn't encounter with the XZ1. It's possible Sony is throttling the processor to keep the temperature down.. That said, benchmarks are just part of the performance story. In actual usage, the XZ1 Compact is snappy, handling multitasking and demanding games like GTA: San Andreas without any slowdown. Generally, you get the same overall performance as the larger sibling.. The phone clocked 5 hours, 40 minutes when we streamed full-screen video over LTE at maximum screen brightness. Compared with the Google Pixel 2 (8 hours, 45 minutes), it's not particularly impressive for a smaller phone. Fortunately, the XZ1 Compact is packed with a number of battery- saving features that help extend screen time by disabling connectivity and reducing brightness and performance. Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 is supported for fast charging.. Like the XZ1, the main camera is 19 megapixels. It takes clear, sharp shots in most lighting conditions, and also fares decently in low light. Color reproduction is good, and we saw little difference in overall picture quality between it and the XZ1. 4K video is stable at 30fps, and the camera can capture stunning 960fps slo-mo.. The 8-megapixel front camera, meanwhile, can switch between wide-angle and regular formats, and the wide-angle mode was able to fit two extra people into group selfies in testing. There's some mild barrel distortion around the edges of wide shots, but it's a small price to pay for being able to get everyone in.. By far the coolest feature, though, is 3D scanning. This is the first phone (along with the XZ1) with sensors that collect data that can be used by 3D display apps, printers, and potentially games that support 3D models. The preloaded scanning app relies on the phone's Motion Eye sensor, which stacks memory directly under the camera so it can transfer a lot of data at once. Its default modes scan faces, heads, food, and free-form objects. It does quite a good job, as you can see here.. To share a scan, you can export it as a. OBJ file, but it becomes smoothed-out, monochrome, and upside down. You can edit the final result before sharing it to a 3D printer or printing service. Sony says it's working on direct connections to social networks and games, to let you post objects in Facebook's 360 video format, for instance.. The XZ1 and XZ1 Compact are among the first phones we've seen running Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box. Sony's Xperia UI is running on top, but aside from some minor visual tweaks with widgets and app icons, it sticks pretty close to stock.. Preloaded apps consist of the standard Sony fare like PlayStation and Movie Creator, along with AVG Protection, Facebook, and Spotify. None of them can be uninstalled, leaving you with 22.07GB of storage available out of a total of 32GB. A microSD card is always an option if you need more space.. For $600, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is the most powerful Android phone you can comfortably use with just one hand. That's increasingly rare to find, and combined with its high-resolution audio and 3D scanning capabilities, the XZ1 Compact is a viable alternative to the pricier Galaxy S8. But if you're not tied to the Android ecosystem, the $399 Apple iPhone SE is still the small phone we most highly recommend. Sony's challenge, as always, will be to sell the XZ1 Compact in a market where very few people buy unlocked phones that aren't from Apple, Google, or Blu.. Bottom Line: With a 4.6-inch screen, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is the smallest, most powerful premium Android phone..

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box. No fingerprint sensor in the U.S. Camera lacks dynamic range and is weak in low light. Sony's UI skin doesn't mesh with Oreo. The Sony Xperia XZ1 has some interesting aspects going for it such as the 3D creator and Android Oreo out of the box but when you boil it all down it's just more of the same from Sony. Fans of Sony's design and hardware will enjoy the XZ1 but for everyone else, there are plenty of better options available.. While other companies have adopted Quad HD displays, dual cameras, and close to bezel-less designs, Sony is sticking to its guns and continues to create smartphones the way it sees fit. Can Sony’s latest, the Xperia XZ1, compete with other flagships while sticking to its tried and tested smartphone formula? Let’s find out in the Sony XZ1 review.. The Xperia XZ1 looks and feels very familiar. It features the same overall boxy, rectangular design Sony has used for years. The XZ1’s design is a slight update, featuring the infinite loop design Sony implemented last year which rounds out the sides for a slightly more rounded look. This loop design now extends to the top and bottom portions of the phone. As a result, the phone can no longer stand vertically on a flat surface on its own.. Sony is definitely trying to update the phoneâs look, but the design is starting to get stale. That problem is further exacerbated by the exciting phone designs that we’re currently seeing from the likes of LG, Samsung, Xiaomi, and Apple. Next to the competition, the XZ1 just doesn’t look like a 2017 flagship.. Sony is definitely trying to update the phoneâs look, but the design is starting to get stale.. The bezels on the XZ1 are quite thick all around, but especially so along the top and bottom. Sony makes good use of these by including front facing stereo speakers, but the Pixel 2 has proven you don’t need huge bezels for front-facing speakers. All utility aside, they just don’t look very good either.. The build quality on the XZ1 is undoubtedly top-notch, though. The all-metal design feels sturdy, durable, and it doesn’t attract fingerprints, though it isn’t the most comfortable phone to hold.. The XZ1’s display is considerably smaller than most 2017 flagships, thought that could be a positive for some.Â. It’s got a 5.2-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 and Sony’s TRILUMINOS technology. It’s not the biggest or highest resolution screen on the market, but Sony’s smartphone panels have never disappointed and the XZ1 is no exception. The black levels may not compare to an AMOLED panel but the overall quality of the display is quite good.. Color reproduction is pleasant and vibrant. Outdoor visibility even under harsh sunlight was surprisingly very good. Sony’s software also allows for tweaking of the screen’s white balance and there are three different color modes with professional, standard, and super-vivid that will alter the screen’s color gamut and contrast.. Professional mode uses the standard sRGB color gamut and will provide the most realistic colors possible, but it may not be the most eye-catching color mode for everyday use as the colors do appear very flat. Standard mode is the default setting for the display and this ups the vibrancy for a more vivid look and uses Sony’s TRILUMINOS color gamut instead. Super-vivid mode will give the display even more vibrancy but this was my least favorite of the three as the colors feel overly saturated and the heavy amount of contrast made content either look unnatural or overly dark.. The display is also HDR10 certified. This means you’ll be able to enjoy content with better color, clarity, and contrast by services such as Netflix. In fact, the XZ1 was recently added to Netflix’s short list of supported HDR devices.. Inside, the specs thankfully don’t deviate from most other flagships that we’re seeing in 2017. The XZ1 is being powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor and the usual 4 GB of RAM. The phone’s got top tier specifications and it shows, performing very well in all aspects. Swiping and scrolling is smooth and pleasant. The XZ1's top tier specs perform very well in all aspects.. Heavier tasks such as multitasking and playing graphically demanding games such as Need For Speed: No Limits or Marvel’s Contest of Champions were no problem for the XZ1. They ran very smoothly without any choppiness or dropped frames.. We’ll get more into the software later in the review but Sony always does a great job by keeping the experience lightweight which helps a lot with the phone’s overall smooth performance.. In terms of hardware the XZ1 has a lot to offer. For starters the phone comes with 64 GB of internal storage and supports microSD expansion up to an additional 256 GB. Like many Sony phones in years past, the XZ1 is IP68 certified which means the phone can survive submersion in water, the occasional spill, or usage in the rain.. Audiophiles will certainly love what the Xperia XZ1 can do.. Audiophiles will certainly love what the XZ1 can do. The phone has a headphone jack, so you won’t need any adapters for your favorite pair of wired headphones. The XZ1’s dual front-facing stereo speakers are a feature that has somewhat faded away in the current smartphone landscape, but they’re great to see here.. This time around Sony has implemented a “SmartAmp” that supposedly provides 50 percent more sound pressure and less speaker degradation over time. The speakers sound extremely good with excellent clarity and no signs of distortion even at max volume, but they only sound marginally louder over previous Sony flagships. Even the aging Nexus 6P sounds considerably louder.. Thankfully, Sony makes up for this by offering a more impressive headphone experience. If you’re coming from previous Sony phones you’ll already be accustomed to many of the audio features that come on the XZ1, which supports a variety of Hi-Res audio codecs such as LPCM, FLAC, ALAC, and DSD.. These options mean you wonât be stuck with the more lossy audio formats used by Spotify, Google Play Music, and Apple Music. However, even if you prefer to stream your music, which many of us do, the XZ1 supports Sony’s DSEE HX technology, which will upscale your lossy audio formats and give you something a little closer to Hi-Res sound. The LDAC codec Sony gifted to Google for Android Oreo is also supported.. Other features that can be found onboard the XZ1 are support for AptX HD audio and Bluetooth 5. One feature you will still not find in the XZ1 (at least if you’re in the U.S.) is a fingerprint sensor, which is pretty disappointing.. On paper the XZ1’s battery seems equally disappointing. It’s got a 2,700 mAh battery, relatively small compared to other competing flagships with 3,000+ mAh cells. Nevertheless, i t still holds up rather well for typical usage. I managed to get 4+ hours of screen-on time when usage is kept to more average tasks such as checking emails, social media, texting, and light web browsing or YouTube.. Heavy gaming or using the 3D Creator app can dramatically reduce the phone's battery life.. Heavy amounts of gaming or using Sony’s new 3D Creator application can dramatically reduce the phone’s battery life. Using the 3D Creator for extended periods can really heat the phone up, too. Charging the XZ1 at least once in the middle of the dayÂ. could be necessary for some power users. The XZ1 features fast charging with Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0, so itâs not too much of a hinderance at least.. The Xperia XZ1 seems to have skipped this year’s dual camera craze. It doesn’t offer dual camera bokeh modes or any fancy video recording tricks, but it is doing a couple of very interesting things that we haven’t seen before in other smartphones. The camera itself is a 19 MP Exmor RS sensor with 5-axis image stabilization, 4K video recording, and slow motion video at 960 frames per second that was first introduced earlier this year with the Xperia XZs.. Sony is dubbing this camera “Motion Eye” because it has predictive capture capabilities that help with capturing unexpected motion. This all happens automatically when the camera senses motion during the picture taking process, such as a car moving or a person running. If the camera detects this it will take three photos before the actual photo is taken, giving you four photos in total (the fourth one being the one you took). You can then review them all and pick which one looks best (or just keep them all). It can also capture unexpected emotions such as a baby randomly smiling but this wasn’t something I was able to test.. As gimmicky as this could be, the predictive motion capture capabilities work quite well. I was very impressed with the results and when you pair it with the camera’s predictive hybrid autofocus capabilities you can capture moving subjects rather easily with little to no motion blur.. The biggest standout feature to the XZ1’s camera is the new 3D Creator app that let’s you create 3D scans of people’s faces, food, and other random objects. Not everyone will find this feature useful but having 3D-scanning capabilities on a mobile phone is undeniably impressive. Sony is working hard to give this technology a variety of use cases beyond creating your own 3D GIFs and stickers.. The new 3D Creator app let's you create 3D scans of people's faces, food, and other random objects.. Creating a 3D scan is rather simple. You first select whether you want to scan a face, a head, food, or perform a free form scan if the object doesn’t fall into any of those categories. The scanning process is dead simple, but youâll want to stick to well lit areas for best results. Low light scans often came out looking deformed in my testing .. Once you’ve completed your scan(s) you can back them up so you never lose them, or you can use the scans as a live wallpaper and print them off if you have a 3D printer. If you don’t have a 3D printer you can order a print of your 3D scan through Shapeways and Sculpteo, with whom Sony has partnered. These 3D scans can also be shared on social media and eventually you’ll be able to use 3D scans of yourself as a gaming avatar or insert yourself into a game when those partnerships become available.. Eventually you'll be able to use 3D scans of yourself as a gaming avatar or insert yourself into a game.. While these new camera tricks are great, ultimately what we care about most is how well the camera takes photos. In well-lit scenarios color reproduction is pleasant without being overly vibrant. There is plenty of sharpness to be had but the camera struggles with dynamic range. Shadows are crushed in virtually every situation causing a lot of detail to be lost and it only gets worse in low light.. Without optical image stabilization, photos don’t always come out with tack sharp focus either. White balance was an issue, as many of my photos came out overly warm or too yellow. The camera also doesn’t do well with highlights as they are typically overexposed with a lot of flaring and streaking effects. Sony’s image processing appears to overly process images in low light which only accentuates the noise and creates artifacts.. If you’re into taking selfies you’ll be much happier with the results as the front facing camera is a 13 MP shooter with f/2.0 aperture. This allows for some high resolution selfies and it’s a wide angle lens so fitting more of the background or other people into the frame isn’t an issue.. Sony’s biggest advantage right now with the XZ1 is with its software. It’s the first Android phone to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box. This of course means you get all of the improvements of the Oreo update such as new visual tweaks, notification dots, a revamped settings menu, native picture-in-picture, adaptive icons, new auto-fill APIs, and much more.. The XZ1 is the first phone to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box.. While Sony’s skin on top of Android is very light and doesn’t change much of the aesthetic, it feels very outdated.Â. The skin hasnât changed in a few versions and, like the XZ1’s external design, it could use a refresh to feel a bit more current.. Otherwise, the software doesn’t offer too much outside of the usual Sony Playstation integration. If you want Android Oreo on a flagship phone right now, this is currently the only option until the new Pixel phones hit shelves.. The Xperia XZ1 isn’t available on any U.S. carrier, meaning you’ll have to shell out $700 for it unlocked. It’s also only compatible with GSM networks like T-Mobile and AT&T in the United States. It’s available now through online retailers such as Amazon, BestBuy, and Sony’s own online store. While $700 is a lot of money for an unlocked phone, it’s still easier to stomach than many of the phones approaching the $1,000 mark .. It’s not the cheapest flagship phone, but it’s certainly not the most expensive, either. It offers some nice features like the 3D Creator that differentiate it from other smartphones, but we can’t shake the feeling that this is just more of the same from Sony. While most manufacturers are now going with more forward looking designs, incorporating elements like bezel-less screens and dual cameras, Sony has stuck with the same smartphone formula they’ve used for awhile. The addition of Android Oreo out of the box is great but it’s a short term selling point. Sony hasn’t done enough to make the Xperia XZ1 stand out from the pack and only the most diehard of Sony fans will find the XZ1 appealing. For the rest of us, there’s simply better options that offer better value at an equal or lesser cost.. Sony , Sony Xperia XZ1. Your source for all things Android!.

Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact review: small but powerful. by Lanh Nguyen November 23, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. No fingerprint sensor in the U.S. While most small smartphones sacrifice hardware and specifications, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is one of the few smartphones on the market that delivers a flagship experience in a smaller size. The XZ1 Compact takes all of the important components of the standard Xperia XZ1 and puts them in a small and easy to use form factor, but it still comes with a full-sized price tag..

While most smartphone OEMs are creating standard and plus or XL sized versions of their smartphones, Sony believes there’s still a market for a small, compact flagship that doesn’t skimp out on the specs. But is there still a need for a small phone with flagship caliber specifications or have consumers fully adapted to the abundance of large screened smartphones that we have today? Find out in our full review of the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact!. The Xperia XZ1 Compact, as the name suggests, is a smaller version of Sony’s main flagship, the Xperia XZ1 and as such it shares many of the same features and specifications. Aside from the phone’s smaller size there are a few key differences, the most notable being the phone’s design.. Instead of the rounder and slightly curvier design of the XZ1, the XZ1 Compact is more reminiscent of classic Sony designs with a more boxy rectangular look. There are some slight tapers all around but for the most part the XZ1 Compact has a flat appearance on all sides and has a less aggressive loop design when compared to the XZ1.. The phone’s construction is also worth noting as it’s made mostly from plastic whereas the XZ1 features an all metal construction. Despite the difference in material choices, the XZ1 Compact has a very solid and sturdy feel and there are hints of metal on the top and bottom portions of the phone that add to the phone’s overall build quality. The phone’s body is coated in a non-glossy satin-like finish that provides a nice grip and doesn’t attract fingerprints.. The XZ1 Compact's main appeal is that it's just as powerful as the standard XZ1, only smaller. If it wasn’t obvious enough already, the XZ1 Compact’s main appeal is that it’s just as powerful as the standard XZ1, only smaller. This smaller size equates to a phone that is an absolute breeze to use in one hand.. Many manufacturers are attempting to make bigger phones smaller by slimming down bezels, but Sony simply made a smaller phone. While having a small phone can have it’s drawbacks, it’s extremely refreshing to use a phone that can be navigated without two hands or any awkward shuffling just to reach the farthest corners of the screen.. A smaller body naturally means a much smaller display. The XZ1 Compact’s screen is an IPS LCD measuring in at at 4.6 inches with a resolution of 1280×720 which is .6 inches smaller on the diagonal than the XZ1 and also lower resolution.. Compared to many smartphone screens that we’ve seen in 2017, the screen on the XZ1 Compact is fairly standard. It’s surrounded by thick bezels on all sides and doesn’t feature any fancy curves or rounded corners. It’s a screen that could easily sound underwhelming but it’s a more than serviceable display especially on a smartphone of this size.. The 720p resolution is low but on a 4.6-inch screen it works perfectly fine, equating to 319 ppi. The 720p resolution is low but on a 4.6-inch screen it works perfectly fine, equating to 319 ppi. It clearly isn’t the sharpest and, having grown so accustomed to quad HD displays, my eyes were immediately able to see the difference. But it’s still sharp enough to comfortably read text, flip through photos or browse the web.. Regardless of sharpness, the quality of the display is quite nice as colors are pleasantly vibrant, the viewing angles are good and outdoor visibility is not an issue in direct sunlight as long as the screen is at max brightness.. Sony’s software allows for tweaking of the display’s colors with a few different profiles that can change the display’s vividness and contrast, and white balance adjustments can also be made to better suit your tastes.. If you're big into media consumption, the small amount of screen real estate feels undeniably cramped.. If you’re big into media consumption, the XZ1 Compact’s screen won’t offer the best experience simply due to its small size, which is the only real downside to this display. It still works fine for watching YouTube or playing games but the small amount of screen real estate feels undeniably cramped.. The guts of the XZ1 Compact are completely identical to it’s bigger brother. The XZ1 Compact features the same Snapdragon 835 processor with 4 GB of RAM and, as expected, the phone performs beautifully. It’s fast to launch apps, play games, and swiping and scrolling through web pages or the Android interface is smooth and fluid.. Are smartphones still getting faster? Does Moore’s law still apply?. Mooreâs Law predicts that the number of transistors used on dense integrated circuits will double year on year. The theory belongs to Gordon Moore, who co-founded Intel and who had observed this trend up to â¦. The lower resolution display certainly makes the phone feel ever so slightly snappier due to less strain being put on the processor. The phone performs every bit as well as any other flagship with the same specs and regardless of how much I threw at it, the XZ1 Compact was always able to keep up.. When it comes to the rest of the phone’s hardware, there are no compromises here and the XZ1 Compact comes with all the bells and whistles that you would want in a smartphone. For starters, there is a 3.5 mm headphone jack and the XZ1 Compact provides the typical slew of audio capabilities as prior Sony phones including Sony’s proprietary DSEE HX technology that will upscale compressed music files for a closer to Hi-Res sound. There’s also built in support for other high resolution audio codecs such as LDAC.. The XZ1 Compact also features dual front facing stereo speakers giving the phone’s thick top and bottom bezels a purpose. The speakers are clear with no distortion but definitely lack in volume compared to other phones with a front facing speaker setup.. Everything you need to know about IP ratings. Itâs a great time to be a tech lover. Looking back on the smartphone releases of 2016, the biggest problem we might have is that virtually every new device is great. For storage, the phone is available in only one storage capacity at 32 GB but should you need more there is a microSD card slot with support for up to 256 GB of additional storage. IP68 dust and water resistance is also on board, giving the phone protection against the occasional splash in the rain or submersion.. The phone does feature a fingerprint sensor in the side mounted power key but, like the last few generations of Sony devices, the fingerprint sensor has been omitted from the U.S. It’s something we’ve now become accustomed to with Sony phones but it’s still disappointing that U.S. consumers don’t have access to this feature.. Despite the phone's smaller size, the battery capacity is still the same 2700 mAh power pack as the standard XZ1 - lasting me a full two full days of use. Despite the phone’s smaller size, the battery capacity is still the same 2700 mAh power pack as the standard XZ1. This sounds small for a phone in 2017, but it has proven itself to be more than enough. Plus, the lower resolution 720p display makes a huge impact to the phone’s longevity.. The XZ1 Compact has been quite the marathon runner, lasting me a full two days of use before needing a charge. I consider myself a heavy user as I watch quite a bit of YouTube and play games for several hours per day on my phone so I was extremely impressed with the XZ1 Compact’s battery life. Screen on time consistently reached the 5 to 6 hour mark.. With the exception of the front facing camera, the camera experience on the XZ1 Compact is identical to the XZ1. The XZ1 Compact features the same 19 MP rear facing Exmor sensor as the XZ1 with 5-axis image stabilization, 4K video recording, and slow motion video at a whopping 960 frames per second.. The main camera experience on the XZ1 Compact is identical to the XZ1. Instead of the 13 MP front facing shooter of the XZ1, the XZ1 Compact has an 8 MP front facing camera but it’s still more than capable for video calls and taking selfies. It’s a wide angle lens which makes it easy to fit more into the frame but it does suffer from some slight barrel distortion towards the edges.. Sony dubs the rear shooter a “Motion Eye” camera as it’s able to predict and capture unexpected motion. The way this works is a fairly simple process and it’s all done automatically by the camera. When the camera senses unexpected motion such as a person running or a moving car it will predictively capture three photos in addition to the one you take yourself giving you 4 photos. You can then assess the results and pick the one that looks best or keep them all.. The XZ1 Compact camera can easily capture moving subjects with little to no motion blur. It’s a neat and useful camera trick that works very well and when paired with Sony’s predictive hybrid autofocus, the camera can easily capture moving subjects with little to no motion blur.. The other standout feature that’s also available on the standard XZ1 is the 3D scanning capabilities through Sony’s new 3D creator app. This app lets you scan faces, food, or any other random object with its free form scan technology. For a mobile product, the 3D scanning of the XZ1 Compact is impressive and Sony is working on giving this technology more utility. For now these scans can be used as wallpapers, GIFs, and be shared to social media but eventually these scans will be capable of being used as gaming avatars or to insert yourself into a game once these partnerships become available.. The scans can be backed up and sync’d to the cloud for safe keeping and you can even print them off if you have a 3D printer. If you don’t own a 3D printer, the 3D creator app allows for easy ordering of your prints through Shapeways or Sculpteo, both of which Sony has partnered with.. The quality of the 3D scans themselves are very accurate and look incredible but for best results you’ll want to create your scans in well lit areas. Scans in low light will make it hard to capture the details properly, which often resulted in deformed scans in my testing.. Here’s what Sony needs to do to get back in the smartphone game. After a series of restructuring efforts, Sony recently announced a return to good looking financial health, stating that the company is on track to set a new annual profit record. Full year profits are expected â¦. With the same rear camera and image processing, the image quality is the same as the standard XZ1. In adequate lighting, color reproduction is pleasant but not oversaturated and there’s plenty of detail and sharpness. But just like the XZ1, the XZ1 Compact’s biggest weakness is dynamic range. Shadows are overly dark causing details to be lost in these areas.. The camera performs decently in low light but the lack of optical image stabilization is apparent as photos don’t always come out with tack sharp focus. White balance can sometimes be problematic and in extreme low light situations, highlights can look heavily overblown with a lot of blooming or flaring effects.. When it comes to software, Sony currently has a big leg up as the XZ1 Compact is currently one of the few smartphones on the market to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo. All of the Android 8.0 features remain intact such as notification dots, native picture-in-picture, improved visual tweaks, new autofill APIs, and much more.. The XZ1 Compact is one of the few smartphones on the market shipping with Android 8.0 Oreo. Sitting on top of Android Oreo is Sony’s own skin which doesn’t drastically alter the experience (as it’s still very close to stock), but Sony’s skin does feel outdated in some aspects. The app drawer for example still utilizes a dedicated button in your dock instead of the swipe up that pure Android uses. Sony’s skin does however include some nice features such as customizable themes and Playstation integration. Outside of Sony’s typical suite of apps the software is virtually free of bloatware.. The Xperia XZ1 Compact is available as an unlocked GSM device and starts at $599.99. It can be purchased through retailers such as Best Buy or Amazon and at the time of this writing it can currently be found at a discount. Unfortunately, you won’t find this phone hitting carrier shelves any time soon if that is your preferred method of purchase.. If one handed usability is your main priority, you won't find a phone that does it better than the XZ1 Compact. The 600 dollar price tag is admittedly steep considering there are many other flagships with better specifications and more forward looking designs for an equal or lesser price. The XZ1 Compact does however have it’s advantages such as the 3D scanning capabilities and Android Oreo out of the box.. But ultimately what it boils down to is how much that compact form factor is worth to you. After all that is the main appeal of this phone. In this day and age a small sized smartphone with flagship specs is hard to come by and if one handed usability is your main priority, you won’t find a phone that does it better than the XZ1 Compact..

Contemporary and powerful chipset with the latest Android OS 8.0. Aging design with large display bezels. Photo quality not as impressive as the sensor technology. Sony now offers two new top-range Xperia smartphones of different sizes for the fall/winter season, called the Xperia XZ1 and Xperia Z1 Compact. The first has a 5.2-inch display and is of common size for a flagship, while the other is Sony’s counter strike to the market trend of offering an even bigger flagship than a flagship. It includes identical features; however, on a smaller, 4.6-inch screen.. While these new devices have modest improvements in terms of their technology and design compared to previous Xperia models, there is just enough novelty here to make them something really special. The 3D Creator for example – an application which combines with the rear-facing camera to serve as a 3D scanner – is of particular interest, but let us first get to know these two devices more closely …. The Sony Xperia Z1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact’s features are more or less the same. Both phones were founded on currently the most powerful Qualcomm chipset, Snapdragon 835 with an octa-core Kyro 280 processor, Adreno 540 graphics and 4 GB of RAM. The larger model has 64 GB of memory storage, while the smaller features 32 GB. Both come with a 19-mega pixel sensor from Sony, sized 1/2,3″ and f/2 of aperture with the option of recording 4K videos and am 8-mega pixel wide-angle selfie camera. Interestingly enough, both phones come with the latest Android OS 8.0 Oreo with the Xperia launcher out of the box.. Apart from their size, the devices differ slightly in their finish: the bigger Sony Xperia XZ1 comes with a 7.4 mm thick aluminum unibody, weighs 155 grams and its front surface is entirely covered in Gorilla Glass 5.. Of course, when the whole body is crafted out of metal, the antenna signal must penetrate the phone’s inside thanks to some trick, therefore three discrete plastic slits were made on the phones’ sides – two on the left and one on the right side.. The smaller Xperia XZ1 Compact comes with a plastic unibody combined with a protective glass layer and also Gorilla Glass 5 in the front, but is significantly thicker at 9.9 mm, despite weighing less: just 140 grams. The use of such materials is not an issue thanks to the slits in the body.. Both phones have an ‘anti twist and anti bend’ construction, as well as ‘full body join structure’, which has helped them earn the IP65/IP68 certificate, offering something that is expected from this phone range: the fact they are waterproof, robust and reliable. The design is typical for Xperias and has been recognizable since 2012, upon its first launch, but still seems very modern and aesthetically pleasing five years later, making Sony models stand among the most beautiful ones in the world. As they are not particularly large, they feel natural when held in hand and are easy to use with just one hand.. The arrangement of the buttons and other design elements is completely identical on both phones. Speaker perforations are located on the front surface, on the rather thick rims above and below the screen. Of course, the front-facing camera is located above the display, along with various sensors and the LED indicator.. It is a shame that Sony did not follow market trends which dictate that the side bezels should be decreased; both models seem to be wasting too much space. This impression is also highlighted by the fact that the control keys (Home, Back and Tasks) make up a standard part of the user interface within the screen, while there is more than enough room for them under the screen.. The rear surface includes the back camera lens with a protective metal ring which slightly sticks out above the surface, which is praise-worthy because it makes it practically impossible for the lens to be scratched. We also have a LED flash. The lower side comes with the primary microphone and a USB Type-C connector, while the upper side holds the 3.5-mm audio jack which Sony is not willing to forsake, logically, just like the secondary microphone. The left side holds the nano-SIM and microSD card slot drawer, protected with a water resistant cover, while the right side includes the Power key, which is ‘surrounded’ by the volume rocker and dedicated camera key.. The display on the bigger device is Sony’s Triluminos with 1920 x 1080p resolution, which, given the fact that Sony offers 4K displays on its phones – may seem disappointing, but with a 5.2-inch diagonal provides perfectly immaculate imaging sharpness and above average contrast sustainability, realistic color saturation and an exceptionally wide viewing angle. The same thing goes for the smaller model’s screen, which has a 720p resolution and performs appropriately on a 4.6-inch diagonal. Whoever purchases one of these two phones will have no objections to the above average experience.. Through various iterations of top-range Xperia models, taking small, yet safe steps, Sony has improved the imaging quality in all segments, step by step, taking its time, but always offering an improvement. Xperia XZ1 and XZ1 Compact can boast with displays whose color saturation, viewing angle, dynamic range and contrast sustainability match those of the most. attractive flagships offered by the competition. What is more, when exposed to direct sunlight, these phones provide most pleasant imaging there is, without the need to increase display brightness and this makes them extremely practical.. Sony’s two top-range models come with the current Qualcomm flagship chipset, Snapdragon 835, based on an octa-core processor with four Kyro cores running a 2.35 GHz clock and four more cores, intended for less demanding tasks, running a 1.9 GHz clock. The graphic system is Adreno 540 and both devices come with 4 GB of RAM.. Of course, this positions them at the very top of synthetic benchmark measurements. While devices with weaker hardware might feel fine for the first few months of use, better hardware like what Sony uses here will guarantee that these two Xperias will continue running smoothly even after a year or more of updates to the OS and applications. Once again, the compact model comes with 32 GB of memory storage, while the bigger one comes with 64 GB.. Interestingly enough, both phones have batteries with the same capacity – 2700 mAh, which is not surprising since the bigger model is slimmer. Still, the smaller screen resolution on Xperia XZ1 Compact suggests the possibility of longer battery life. To be precise, battery life is actually one of the biggest drivers of new phone purchases, and battery life is something Sony has been perfecting through various iterations of these models. Thus, with average use, the bigger model will have to be recharged every other night, while the compact Xperia phone can last a bit longer and can be used more intensely throughout the day if it is to be recharged every other night.. It should be pointed out that both phones come with QuichCharge 3.0 support and Qnovo adaptive charging, which extends battery life through multiple charging cycles, which is, apart from the mentioned chipset, yet another detail that promises a longer life span of these devices compared to the competition.. The quality of photographs taken with the Sony Xperia XZ1 and XZ1 Compact is above average, even though the increment is much smaller in this department compared to the previous models. Sony produces some of the best camera sensors in the world – they are often used by other premium mobile phone brands as well – but Sony doesn’t always go the extra mile to take advantage of the latest sensor technology in its devices. Thus, photo quality is on par with upper-range Xperias, as they turn out. very sharp, abundant with details, but with slightly overly saturated colors and appear almost “too touched up” when taken in poorer lighting conditions.. The camera that Sony uses on both models actually has an excellent 19-mega pixel IMX400 ExmorRS sensor, familiar since the so-called Motion Eye camera featured on the Xperia XZ Premium model, revealed at this year’s MWC. During these six months, Sony has added a few software gimmicks to the camera, avoiding the market trend of using two sensors on top models, at the same time omitting optical stabilization on the sensors, which is a shame. The mentioned Motion Eye enables slow motion video recording with 960 fps, while the sensor speed enables rapid eye shooting in full resolution (19 megapixels). Technically, the rear-facing camera is exceptionally advanced on these two models There is still room for touching up the end results.. The feature that makes the cameras on both Xperias exceptionally interesting is their 3D scanning option. It is called the 3D Creator and is used with a preinstalled application of the same name. The two new phones can perform a 3D scan of any static object in approximately 20 seconds, including a human head if the person is sitting still, by encircling the object from every direction until its entire visible surface is covered.. The end result, the 3D model, can be displayed from all sides on the device’s screen and be used for replication via a 3D printer.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact have modest, evolutionary improvements compared to their predecessors, but with the 3D Creator, Sony offers something that will turn heads. This feature will influence how users perceive the Sony brand, especially if those users are fans of augmented reality or 3D printing.. Sony’s fast pace of revealing new top-range models seems to make Xperias resemble their predecessors too much. That being said, the two latest models – the Xperia XZ1 and the Xperia XZ1 Compact – are actually the best examples that devices from this manufacturer can rival flagship phones from the competition. Despite the fact that Sony ignores some of the typical trends in the mobile market, the new long-lasting Sony phones offer innovations that put these new smartphones on par with the most up-to-date technology in the mobile industry..

I got this phone back in October - after being iPhone for 4 years - and initially I regretted changing phones. The Sony kept randomly restarting and crashing at points - even restarting randomly during a call to my boyfriend. I decided to persevere for a bit and glad I'm did. Since the first update I've had no issues whatsoever! I believe the issues are more linked to the oreo software and not the actual phone itself! The camera is fantastic, scrolling through screens/processor is so much quicker than the iPhone, its so much easier to use and I can actually last a whole day with the battery life!!!! The phone doesn't feel as fragile to hold either!. Rated 4 out of. I bought it just before Christmas and love it brillant screen fabulous pictures. Rated 5 out of. Bought this 2 weeks ago - very impressed with sound quality through good headphones and using the stereo speakers. I have only taken a few photos, but the camera is good too..... Rated 5 out of. Previously had a Z5 so upgrading into the xz1 was super easy. Nice new subtle features which has improved on the Z5. Needless to say it has a great camera. The slow motion feature is fantastic, in the right conditions you can get some amazing videos that make capturing special moments even better. The battery on this has been very good. Battery care feature sounds like it will keep it going throughout my contract term. If yove had a Sony phone before this will be easy to jump into, if you haven't then this is a really good practical phone that does the job..

Sony Xperia XZ1 hands-on: Pricey camera tricks. Would you pay $700 for extreme slow-mo video and 3D scanning?. I blew my mind earlier this year when I watched my extremely slowed-down footage of a bird in mid-flight. I was testing the Sony Xperia XZ Premium's camera , which can record video at up to 960 fps -- four times as slow as the iPhone's 240 fps. I was mesmerized by the videos, but they still didn't justify the whopping $800 that Sony is charging for that handset. So when I heard that the company was bringing the same camera features to the more affordable Xperia XZ1, I was intrigued. Unfortunately, when Sony revealed the XZ1's price to be $700, most of that enthusiasm evaporated.. Gallery: Hands-on with Sony's XZ1 and XZ1 Compact | 28 Photos. That means you'll only be saving $100 with the XZ1, which has a smaller, 5.2-inch screen than the XZ Premium's 5.5-inch panel. To be fair, the XZ1 is impressive in its own right. Like the Premium, the XZ1 uses the same screen technology that Sony uses in its Bravia TVs. While the Premium goes up to 4K, the XZ1 sports a full HD resolution. Both Xperias support HDR content and will play HDR video by default on Netflix and Amazon. At a recent briefing in New York, the XZ1's display looked rich and crisp, although I didn't get to check out those HDR features during my demo.. I was more fixated on the XZ1's camera though. It packs the latest generation of Sony's Motion Eye camera system, which uses a 1GB memory-stacked camera that the company says is five times faster than rival smartphones at processing images. That means you can shoot more photos in rapid succession before running into lag. In addition to the same 960 fps video-recording ability as the XZ Premium, the XZ1 can also produce realistic 3D scans of people and objects in less than a minute.. This is done through the new 3D Creator tool that uses Sony's algorithms to capture high-quality scans. You can choose from four modes: Head, Face, Food and Freeform. On-screen instructions tell you to move around your subject while aiming the phone at her head, and once you've collected enough information, the phone will start stitching the scan together. The whole process took about a minute during my testing, and the resulting 3D image was surprisingly smooth and detailed, considering it had been çreated with a 19-megapixel smartphone camera.. You can share these scans with your friends on messenger apps as 3D stickers, use them as avatars, set them as animated wallpaper or send them to 3D printers. Sony says it is working on getting partnerships with popular 3D-printing services to make that process a bit easier, but for now you'll likely have to export the file and bring it to a printer yourself.. While the 3D-scanning feature is a cool new trick, it's not something that you are likely to use everyday. You'll probably find the new Autofocus burst tool more valuable. It's an enhanced version of Sony's existing predictive hybrid autofocus, which debuted in the Xperia X last year. On the XZ1, pictures you shoot in burst mode at 10 fps should remain in focus, even at the camera's full 19-megapixel resolution. On my hands-on device, multiple shots of me walking toward the camera all looked clear, with just the last one appearing fuzzy, which is understandable, as I had gotten closer than arm's length away from the phone.. I also tried out the new predictive-motion and smile-capture features, which are somewhat complicated. When you're framing up your photo with the XZ1, it will continuously detect smiles or sudden motion and save those moments. Then, when you press the shutter button, the phone will capture the image at the moment you tap the screen but also moments that it saved in the second before you hit the trigger. After that, it will show you up to four options and you can pick your favorite.. The theory behind this feature is that photo-worthy moments may pass you by as you are getting ready to take the shot. It's a similar idea to the iPhone's Live Photos , except Apple records a brief video and offers more frames for you to select after taking the shot. Predictive motion or smile capture can help you save them even if you didn't hit the button at the exact time an elusive smile or lucky coincidence happened. The trouble is, with the early XZ1 we saw, this was unpredictable and hard to understand. I tried suddenly raising and lowering my arms in front of the unit's camera while a Sony rep tried to snap my picture. But the pictures that the XZ1 ended up showing didn't capture the moments I moved my arms but rather me standing still. Yes, the device I saw was still a prototype with early software, so it's possible Sony could have a more reliable version by the time the phones ship, but for now I remain unimpressed.. Speaking of unnecessary complication, the XZ1's 960 fps slow-motion video recording is as difficult to manage as on the XZ Premium. You'll need to enable slow-mo mode, hit record, then press the trigger button to start recording. As you're filming, you have to tap a dedicated on-screen key to save the next three seconds in slow-mo. You can use this repeatedly as you're recording, but you'll have to be able to anticipate when you want to slow down the clip as you're shooting to get the exact footage you want. And that usually only happens with planned or staged shoots.. Poor execution aside, the XZ1's rear camera still takes crisp, vibrant pictures. Its 13-megapixel front camera also takes sharp selfies, and Sony finally added a display-flash feature that lights up your screen to brighten up portraits in low light. On my preview unit, I activated this by pressing the flash button on the top left of the viewfinder in selfie mode, and a warm, flattering light took over the screen for a second when I snapped the picture. That's a nice addition, even if it arrives years after it came to other smartphones.. Another feature that Sony has been late in implementing on the Xperia line is a fingerprint sensor, and the XZ1 also lacks one. You'll still have to tap in a passcode, PIN or a swipe pattern to unlock your phone. The XZ1 will be the first smartphone to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo , though, so maybe that will make up for the inconvenience of a missing fingerprint scanner.. The XZ1 has the same Snapdragon 835 processor as the XZ Premium, so you can expect top-of-the-line performance and gigabit LTE speeds where (or when) they're available. The new handset has a smaller 2,700mAh battery than the Premium's 3,230mAh cell. Like you might expect from an Xperia, the XZ1 is rated IP68 for water and dust-resistance and sports a distinctive boxy, all-metal design that Sony says helps with antenna performance.. If you want a new Xperia but prefer either a smaller or larger screen, Sony also unveiled the XZ1 Compact and XA1 Plus. The former is a smaller, less-premium version of the XZ1 that will cost $600 when it arrives in October. The Compact has a non-HDR 4.6-inch screen, which is tiny by today's standards. Some people may appreciate the smaller size, but its 720p resolution is ridiculously underwhelming for the price. The XZ1 Compact will also run Android Oreo when it ships, and it sports an 8-megapixel front camera with a wide 120-degree field of view so you can take selfies that include more friends or surroundings. Otherwise, the Compact's rear camera offers the same bells and whistles as the regular XZ1's and is powered by the same CPU.. On the other hand, the XA1 Plus is a mid-tier phone that will cost a more affordable $380 via Amazon when it retails in October. Sony most likely achieved that lower price because it opted for a less-popular MediaTek processor instead of a Qualcomm Snapdragon component. If you're willing to take a chance on a lesser-known processor, you may find the XA1 Plus a good deal. Its 5.5-inch screen has a 1080p resolution, and its battery is a generous 3,430mAh. You'll also get a sharper 23-megapixel rear camera, although it won't have all the new features from the XZ line.. Ultimately, Sony's new XZ1 phones suffer from a flaw that has plagued the company's premium handsets for years: They are simply too expensive for what they offer. Sony seems to keep thinking it can command the higher prices that Samsung and Apple ask for their flagships. But Sony doesn't have the smartphone clout and the vast legions of fans that Sammy and Apple do, and the Xperias, while respectable, aren't quite as advanced as the latest Galaxies and iPhones. They don't even have fingerprint sensors, which are by now so late they might as well not show up. The latest flagships either already have, or are expected to support, iris- and voice-authentication tools. Since I've only experienced a preproduction version of the XZ1, it's possible the finished device that retails on Sept. 19 may feel refined and competent enough to justify its price. For now, though, I sincerely hope Sony rethinks the way it prices its products..

No fingerprint sensor for US customers.. Sony's Xperia XZ1 is a powerful smartphone with a unique 3D-scanning camera that could earn it a following among 3D printing enthusiasts.. The new Xperia XZ1's ($699.99) fascinating 3D-scanning feature is like no other phone on the market. Using the rear camera and a set of special sensors, the XZ1 is able to capture detailed scans of faces, food, and other objects. You can even print the results if you have a 3D printer or pay for a printing service. This unique feature, together with powerful specs, excellent audio quality, and the latest software, make the unlocked Xperia XZ1 the most interesting phone Sony has made in a long time, but one that will only appeal to a niche set of users.. The Xperia XZ1 has a smooth, cool metal body with softly rounded sides. But Sony's design hasn't changed in years and the large bezel looks dated these days when the trend is toward tall-and-narrow phones with little to no bezel.. The phones measures 5.8 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs in at 5.5 ounces, making it pretty big for the screen size, especially when placed next to the Samsung Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces) and LG G6 (5.9 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.8 ounces). Using it with one hand can be a challenge.. View All 8 Photos in Gallery. A volume rocker, power button (with a fingerprint scanner disabled for the US market), and camera shutter are all placed on the right. The left side features a SIM/microSD card slot that worked fine with a 256GB card. Like most Sony phones and other top-tier Androind phones, the XZ1 is rated IP68, meaning it can handle immersion in six feet of water for up to 30 minutes.. The 5.2-inch screen is 1,920-by-1,080 HD, rather than the 2,560-by-1,440 Quad HD found on most of its competitors, or the 4K resolution on the XZ Premium. The resolution still works out to a crisp 424 pixels per inch. That's similar to the 1080p OnePlus 5, but not nearly as sharp as the Quad HD Galaxy S8 (570ppi). Viewing angles are great and brightness is solid, though not as blinding as the S8.. In general, Sony's LCD panels are excellent examples of the genre, with a slew of buzzwords like Triluminos and X-Reality referring to ways to amp up the color gamut and contrast level to perform more like OLEDs (you can also pick between the modes and adjust white balance in settings). Sony also kicks up the screen with one big improvement: HDR10 , as seen on the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. It helps colors pop when viewing compatible video content.. While the XZ1 isn't being sold through carriers, it has gigabit LTE for AT&T and T-Mobile. Not many other phones can reach that level of LTE speed; the Galaxy S8 can, but iPhones can't. During our testing in midtown Manhattan, we experienced strong network connectivity on T-Mobile, recording top speeds of 22.4Mbps up and 12.1Mbps down.. Transmissions come across loud and clear, noise cancellation is great, and the earpiece volume is easy to hear even in a noisy environment.. The XZ1 has dual front-facing speakers that give you loud sound for watching video or streaming music. It's not quite room-filling, but it has more depth to it than most phone speakers. And the loud speaker translates into a loud speakerphone.. There's a standard headphone jack and Bluetooth 5.0, which both come with a long string of audio enhancements, including support for various high-resolution codecs and transmission methods, and digital noise cancellation. This gets you high-quality audio regardless if you use wired or wireless audio. For wired listening, I used a pair of Meze 99 Classics , while sticking to my trusty Bose QuietControl 30 for wireless. Both gave me great sound quality with crisp highs and rich bass, though audiophiles will likely prefer to stay plugged in.. Other connectivity protocols include Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz) and NFC. You won't be able to use it for mobile payments, though, because like all Sony phones, the XZ1 lacks the use of its fingerprint sensor in the US.. The XZ1 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. It scored 165,553 on the AnTuTu benchmark, which is a measure of overall system performance. That's higher than the Galaxy S8 (158,266), which is powering a more demanding display, but lower than the Google Pixel 2 XL (167,731), which has a purer version of Android software.. With numbers like these and 4GB of RAM under the hood, performance is unsurprisingly very smooth. The XZ1 multitasked without a hiccup and handled demanding games like GTA: San Andreas without any slowdown. At this point, you're pretty much going to get the same performance experience when it comes to any high-end phone.. The phone clocked 5 hours, 27 minutes in our rundown test, in which we stream full-screen video over LTE at maximum screen brightness. That's just under than the S8's 5 hours, 45 minutes, while the Pixel 2 XL puts both of them to shame with 9 hours, 25 minutes. That said, you'll find the usual set of battery-saving software on the XZ1, including Stamina mode and Ultra Stamina mode to extend screen time by disabling certain functions and cutting down performance. The phone supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 and uses software to manage charging speed to extend the battery's overall lifespan.. The XZ1 is all about the camera. There's a 19-megapixel imager on the back, with the same special sensors as the XZ Premium, including RGB, IR, and CMOS sensors to improve color reproduction, focus speed, and low-light shooting. Motion Eye, a memory-embedded sensor that reduces post-processing time, is also present. All of this makes for a great all-around camera that's close to matching the Galaxy S8 in image quality, which we consider to be one of the top camera phones on the market.. The Xperia takes clear, crisp pictures outdoors, focuses quickly, and handles well in a range of lighting conditions, though it can't beat the Pixel 2 XL in lower light. You can record video in 4K at a stable 30fps, and the phone is able to shoot super-slow-motion video at 960fps, which makes even mundane actions look pretty incredible with good lighting. There's also a 13-megapixel front camera that takes clear shots with plenty of detail, though it lacks the smaller XZ1 Compact's wide-angle selfie mode.. In addition to overall solid performance, the XZ1 has one more trick up its sleeve with its 3D-scanning feature. Using the preloaded 3D Creator app, the phone is able to perform detailed 3D scans of faces, food, and other objects. I spent quite a bit of time scanning the head of my colleague, Max Eddy, and after a bit of trial and error, I was able to create a detailed, high-resolution recreation of his face in full color. It even got details like hair texture.. You need to scan in an area with uniform lighting. I tried outdoors in bright sunlight, indoors under balanced studio lights, and in a room lit by natural light. None of them satisfied the XZ1, which kept telling me the lighting wasn't ideal. Fortunately, you can still proceed with the scan. Make sure the subject is sitting still and isn't wearing glasses (they create a distracting seam), then follow the instructions that appear on the phone. It took a few attempts, but I got some very good scans. Object scans are a bit easier. Using free-form scanning, I captured a Fallout 4 helmet and got a fairly accurate 3D model.. Now, when it comes to practical uses for this feature, there aren't many at the moment. You can create 3D avatars, stick them into AR games, and take some nifty screenshots. To share the scans, you can export them as .OBJ files, but if you export the file, it becomes smoothed-out, monochrome, and upside down. And as you can see in the image above, there is some loss of detail in the 3D print of Max's head. If you don't have a 3D printer, you can order prints from Shapeways or Sculpte.. Sony says it's working on direct connections to social networks and games, to let you post objects in Facebook's 360 video format, for instance.. The Xperia XZ1 is the first phone to launch running Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box. Sony's Xperia UI comes on top, but aside from some minor visual tweaks with widgets and app icons, it sticks pretty close to stock.. 3D magic aside, Sony doesn't load the XZ1 with much extra bloatware. Preloaded apps consist of the standard Sony ones like PlayStation and Movie Creator, and a small handful of third-party apps like AVG Protection, Facebook, and Spotify. None of them can be uninstalled, but you still have 53.27GB of available storage out of a total of 64GB, plus you can use a microSD card.. Sony has long had a line of good-quality, premium-feeling phones that just haven't differentiated themselves because they're costly and not sold through US carriers. At $700, the XZ1 arguably falls into that mold with specs that are on par with the Galaxy S8, Pixel 2 XL, and Moto Z2 Force , but lacking the more widespread availability of its rivals. That said, Sony doesn't really need to fight Samsung or Apple. Tying the XZ1 lineup to the current trend toward 3D printing and scanning might be just that.. If you're the owner of a 3D printer, the XZ1 and the smaller XZ1 Compact may have something to offer you. But for broader carrier compatibility and the nicest all-around combination of design, software, and hardware, the Galaxy S8 is a stronger bet.. Bottom Line: Sony's Xperia XZ1 is a powerful smartphone with a unique 3D-scanning camera that could earn it a following among 3D printing enthusiasts..

Sony Xperia XZ1, XZ1 Compact hands-on. Justly or not, it’s sometimes hard to live up to the bar set high by the likes of Samsung and Apple. Manufacturers like HTC and Sony sometimes struggle to make ends meet as far as their mobile businesses are concerned. You have give Sony props, however, for refusing to budge or even refusing to change its strategy. Because while Sony has supposedly tried to streamline its smartphone portfolio, here it is again, at IFA 2017, to bring consumers more choices in the form of an all time classic Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact.. All the fuss about thinning bezels is bound to tick some users off. Not everyone cares about having no borders around their screens. In fact, some might even consider bezel-less screen a usability nightmare. Imagine all the accidental activations courtesy of your inner hand. For them, the likes of the Sony Xperia XZ1 and XZ1 Compact offer a much welcome reprieve.. Although Sony has fiddled a bit with the design last year with its new “Loop Surface” language, the Xperia X family has largely stuck with a classic and easily identifiable Sony design, which, truth be told, goes a long way in establishing a phone’s identify in the midst of the a sea of nearly identical smartphones. The Xperia XZ1 and XZ1 Compact are certainly no different, though they do differ from each other in significant ways beyond just the size. While the Xperia XZ1 sports an all-metal body fitting a high-end flagship, the Xperia XZ1 Compact only looks metal, thanks to some metallic paint.. The Xperia XZ1 is premium in all things but one, its 5.2-inch TRILUMINOS LCD screen that only goes as high as 1920×1080 Full HD resolution. Then again, not really many cared for the Xperia XZ Premium’s 4K screen anyway. And some do still firmly believe that 1080p is still the way to go, except when VR is concerned. The rest of the Xperia XZ1’s specs are pretty topnotch, with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, 4 GB of RAM, and 64 GB of storage. The 2,700 mAh battery might be a bit worrying, but Sony is famous for its STAMINA mode in that regard.. • Operating System: Android 8.0. • CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. • Display: 5.2-inch Full HD HDR TRILUMINOS. • Main Camera: 19 MP, 1/2.3-inch, Motion Eye, Slo-Mo 960fps, Triple Image Sensing, Predictive Hybrid Autofocus. • Secondary Camera: 13 MP, 1/3.06-inch, f/2.0. The Xperia XZ1 Compact is a mini flagship in every sense of the word. The screen is reduced in size and resolution to 4.6 inches 720p HD, an acceptable compromise for some when it comes to handiness. It has the same Snapdragon 835 and same 4 GB of RAM but only half the storage at 32 GB. Amazingly, the battery is actually the same at 2,700 mAh, despite the smaller body.. • Operating System: Android 8.0. • CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. • Display: 4.6-inch HD TRILUMINOS. • Main Camera: 19 MP, 1/2.3-inch, Motion Eye, Slo-Mo 960fps, Triple Image Sensing, Predictive Hybrid Autofocus. • Secondary Camera: 8 MP, 1/4-inch. A word has to be said about the camera on both smartphones, which are also identical. Now the last remaining holdout in a dual camera world, the Xperia XZ1 and XZ1 Compact bear the same 19 megapixel 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS sensor, with the slew of photography technologies that Sony introduced earlier this year, including Motion Eye, 960 fps slow motion, Predictive Capture, Triple image sensing technology, and Predictive Hybrid AF. The one new bullet point in this list is “3D scan”, which utilizes all the phones imaging sensors to create a hi-res 3D model of an object for 30 to 60 seconds. Such a model might be useful for 3D printing or a virtual avatar. That is, if Sony actually decides to make it useful.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 and XZ1 Compact will admittedly face an uphill battle against the new flagships this half of the year. In a fast-changing smartphone market, Sony might be chided for repeatedly putting new wine into old wineskins. Then again, there are definitely those who prefer the timeless and nearly unchanging face of an Xperia phone. Hopefully Sony will have a more forgiving pricing scheme this time around..

Sony’s Xperia XZ1 Compact proves good things can come in small packages. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is one of the few, powerful, small Android phones around, but it’s too expensive..

The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is one of the few, powerful, small Android phones around, but it’s too expensive.. Geekbench 4 CPU: 1,834 single-core, 6,508 multi-core. 3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 3,501. Android 8.0 Oreo with a Sony touch. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Sony has failed to keep up with the smartphone crowd over the last few years, but it’s one of few still making small phones that can pack a punch. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact has the same cutting-edge processor, camera, and battery in as the flagship XZ1. It’s fast, slick, and can be comfortably used one-handed. It stands out in a sea of large-screen phones, but it’s not an unqualified success. At $600, we wish Sony could have found a way to shrink the price tag as well as it did the hardware. There are things we like very much, but there are also some serious issues here.. Sony still shows no interest in jumping on the bezel-less bandwagon , but it’s not just the large borders above and below the 4.6-inch display that bother us here. The XZ1 Compact is seriously chunky at 9.3mm thick.. The glass fiber plastic body feels and looks a bit cheap. We don’t like the seam where it meets the Gorilla Glass 5 on the front. Flat, angular, metal panels on the top and bottom accentuate the bulky look. It reminds us of a portable battery charger , which is not a pleasing aesthetic for a phone.. You’ll find a standard 3.5mm headphone jack at the top and a USB Type-C charging port on the bottom. On the left spine there’s a fiddly flap that houses incredibly thin plastic trays for the MicroSD card and the SIM card. Our SIM card tray proved a little tricky to open. The only advantage of these silly flaps is that you don’t need a SIM tray tool to open them.. The right edge has a lozenge-shaped power button in the middle with a volume rocker above and a camera shutter button at the bottom, perfectly placed for capturing shots when you hold your XZ1 Compact in landscape orientation.. version of the XZ1 Compact here, so the power button is just a power button. It’s worth noting that if you buy it anywhere else in the world the power button will also work as a fingerprint sensor. Sony has never adequately explained why it does this in the U.S., citing “business reasons,” but it is extremely annoying to have to use a PIN or pattern again.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is a fast, slick device that can be comfortably used one-handed.. On the back there’s the camera lens at the top left, ringed with a shiny metal highlight, and a flash module in the middle. Flipping back over to the front, Sony has made some use of the big edges flanking the screen to include dual front-facing speakers, alongside the front-facing camera and other sensors.. Switching to the XZ1 Compact from the iPhone 8. was jarring in terms of design. These are similarly sized phones, but Apple’s all-glass sandwich is much more stylish and a full 2mm thinner than the XZ1 Compact.. We don’t even have to compare Sony’s latest with Apple’s to find fault. Casting our minds back to the Xperia Z1 Compact , which we loved, it’s hard to escape the feeling that Sony is going backwards on design. We should note, Sony said its phones will get a redesign , and expect to see this next year.. The Xperia XZ1 Compact comes in White Silver, Black, Twilight Pink, or Horizon Blue. Our review unit was blue, and the plastic body has a kind of metallic sheen to it.. You’ll find a dinky 4.6-inch display in the Xperia XZ1 Compact with a resolution of 1,280 x 720 pixels, which is adequate for a screen this size. The iPhone 8 is a hair sharper. The Compact’s colors are vibrant and it’s gets bright enough to see the screen outdoors.. We did not find ourselves missing the higher resolutions of other phones, but we did miss the size. It’s a lot easier to read on a phone like the HTC U11. or the Samsung Galaxy S8 , but they obviously pack much larger screens.. The Xperia XZ1 Compact looks like quite a tough device and indeed it has an IP65/68 rating, but you must be very careful to shut the flap tightly before exposing it to water. Rain is nothing to worry about and it should survive a dunk in the bath.. If we had to highlight one good thing about the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact beyond its small stature, then we’d pick performance. With a Snapdragon 835 and 4GB of RAM inside, this phone is fast.. We had no issues playing games. From Asphalt 8 to Star Wars: Commander , everything loaded and ran smoothly. We also streamed some Netflix and tried out some music to test the front-facing speakers and they performed admirably.. General navigation is silky smooth, and the pleasing performance was confirmed when we ran the usual batch of benchmarks. Here’s how the Xperia XZ1 Compact scored:. Those are great scores that put the XZ1 Compact in the same performance category as Android flagships like the LG V30 , the HTC U11 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they’re almost identical to the scores its bigger sibling, the Sony Xperia XZ1. Only Apple’s iPhones can best that – the iPhone 8 scored a massive 214,492 on AnTuTu.. Sony makes excellent camera hardware, as evidenced by the fact that you’ll find Sony image sensors inside everything from Google’s Pixel 2. to the latest trio of iPhones. What it seems to struggle with is the software side and image processing, so hardware that sounds great on paper often under delivers in the real world.. With a Snapdragon 835 and 4GB of RAM inside, this phone is fast.. The XZ1 Compact boasts a 19-megapixel main camera with an f/2.0 aperture. That’s the same camera you’ll find in the XZ1 and the XZ Premium. Shooting with the default Superior Auto mode, most photos turned out very detailed with accurate colors, but we ran into two issues that bothered us.. Firstly, the autofocus jumped around a lot and we often struggled to get it to focus where we wanted. This resulted in several shots with blurry subjects. Secondly, and more problematically, we found that low light photos were filled with noise and distinctly fuzzy around the edges of objects like buildings or tree branches. We’re not talking about dark conditions here, just your average overcast day in Scotland.. Comparing the Xperia XZ1 Compact’s camera with a few phones we’ve used recently – the HTC U11 and iPhone 8 – we can unequivocally say it’s a disappointment. Too many of our photos looked smeared. There’s no optical image stabilization (OIS) — instead the Xperia XZ1 Compact relies on electronic image stabilization (EIS) and we wonder if that’s a part of the problem.. We do like the inclusion of the dedicated camera button, and while we though there’s a chance it could be introducing some movement that’s causing the blurring, switching to the onscreen shutter button didn’t make much difference. It’s a good camera overall, but it doesn’t match the latest flagships from competitors.. At $600, Sony is asking too much for the Xperia XZ1 Compact.. Most people won’t use it, but there is also an in-depth manual mode if you want to tweak your settings and explore the camera’s capabilities.. The front-facing camera is rated at 8 megapixels with an f/2.4 aperture and a wide 120-degree field of view that’s perfect for group selfies.. When it comes to video, the Xperia XZ1 Compact has a nifty trick up its sleeve – slow motion 960 frames per second at 720p. It can also record 4K at 30fps, and 1080p at up to 60fps. The slow motion feature is fun, but you really need good lighting or the resulting footage will be extremely noisy.. We’re pleased to find that the Xperia XZ1 Compact runs the latest Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box, because too many manufacturers lag on Google’s latest Android releases. But Sony has applied its own user interface over the top. It’s not as elegant as stock Android, but it looks and works just fine.. Sony does, unfortunately, feel the need to preload lots of useless apps, which is disappointing because this phone only comes with 32GB of storage and only around 20GB free out of the box. Thankfully, there is a MicroSD card slot for storage expansion.. The Xperia Lounge and Sony’s What’s New app are the worst offenders, but we quite liked the 3D Creator, which allows you to scan people or objects and create 3D models of them.. Sony has packed the same 2,700mAh battery into the Xperia XZ1 Compact as you’ll find in the XZ1. The Compact has a much smaller, lower resolution display to power, so we’re not surprised to find the battery lasts much longer.. With medium use we always had plenty of battery life remaining at bedtime. The Xperia XZ1 Compact can even go two days before needing to be plugged in, if you’re careful.. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact Compared To. It’s also quick to charge, with support for Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 via the USB-C charging port. When we tried it out, it went from 19 percent up to 79 percent in just under an hour. You can expect it to take about 2 hours to fully charge from near zero.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact has a standard one-year warranty that covers defects in design, materials, or workmanship. You’re not covered for accidental or water damage, so be careful.. You can buy the Xperia XZ1 Compact from online retailers like Amazon and it will cost you $600. It’s not available from carriers, but it supports GSM networks, so it will work just fine on networks like AT&T and T-Mobile. If you’re on Verizon or Sprint and don’t want to switch, then the Xperia XZ1 Compact is not for you.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is a decent phone with good battery life, great performance, and the latest version of Android. It’s a shame it’s too expensive, looks dull, the lack of a fingerprint sensor is irritating, and the camera simply isn’t as good as it should be.. At $600, Sony is asking too much for the Xperia XZ1 Compact. Just $50 more nets you the far superior HTC U11 or you could snag the OnePlus 5. If you prefer something smaller, check out the Essential Phone. ($500) or the Google Pixel 2 ($650). They have their flaws, but they’re both better prospects than the Xperia XZ1 Compact and feel a little more contemporary.. If you don’t care about sticking with Android, then Apple’s iPhone 8 is worth a look. It’s a very similar size and it’s a better phone, but it does cost an extra $100.. If you do buy a Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact, then you can expect to get a couple of years out of it. There’s enough power there to future-proof it for the foreseeable. Our Xperia Z1 Compact lasted three years before the power button began to fail. We think you’ll get sick of the XZ1 Compact and want to switch it long before it actually gives out.. We think there are too many better options for most people. If you’re a die-hard Sony fan, or you have your heart set on a small form factor, and you live outside the States so the fingerprint sensor works, then the Xperia XZ1 Compact is worth considering.

The Xperia XZ1 Compact may look similar to previous phones from Sony, but it packs a punch and is perhaps the best small-form-factor Android phone around right now, making it a great choice if you want a device you can use one-handed.. and release date Price is set at £499/$580 The phone is out now in the US and UK. Small form factor is great for those who don't want a device with a huge screen Typical Sony design of the last few years, but uses plastic on the rear 4.6-inch 720p display is sharp and bright, much better than it sounds on paper. One of the main issues with 2016’s Sony Xperia X Compact was that it had forgotten its legacy. While maintaining its iconic, pocket-sized demeanour, it lacked the brawn and playful quality of the Xperia Z5 Compact .. Thankfully, Sony has come to its senses with the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact.. This 4.6-inch smartphone is capable of just about everything its larger sibling, the flagship Sony Xperia XZ1 is, but in a smaller, more battery-efficient form factor that can be easily operated with one hand.. If you’re looking for a smaller Android handset, this is one of the few you can buy that offers top-end specs along with a compact design.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact release date was in September 2017 and if you live in the US, UK or Australia you'll be able to buy it now.. Prices fluctuate from week to week, but we've seen it as low as £450 / $580 / AU$620 and that's a touch below the RRP. In the UK you can buy the phone on contract too with the best Xperia XZ1 Compact deals starting at around £20 a month with 1GB of data.. Like the XZ1, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact has received a bit of a shake-up in terms of design over its predecessor. While it’s still boxier than the larger flagship, its edges have been slightly rounded off for a more ergonomic feel in the hand.. Compared with the full-size XZ1 you might be expecting some compromises to have been made in the process of squeezing this phone into its compact form factor. But other than its dimensions, which come in at 129 x 64 x 9.3mm, there’s honestly not much that’s different here, that’s a good thing.. While the chunky design might put some people off, there’s something rather endearing about the XZ1 Compact. Its almost cutesy look is appealing, and it’s nice to have a smaller option when most mainstream manufacturers are only making large-screen premium phones.. The body of the phone is plastic, but it’s not ‘plastic’ in the cheap sense of the word – and it certainly doesn’t feel like a low-end phone in the hand.. The unibody is constructed from a glass fiber woven plastic, which is both strong and lightweight and also gives the phone a pleasing feel and finish. You really wouldn’t know this wasn’t metal, as it feels sturdy when you’re holding it in your hand.. The top and bottom of the device are capped with metal, while the front is protected by Gorilla Glass. Thanks to the smaller design we also don’t think this phone is particularly heavy at 140g.. When you’ve got this phone on your person you’ll barely notice it, while with many modern smartphones it’s all you can do to fit them in your jeans pocket. Sony’s habit of making its smartphones dust- and water-resistant continues here, with the XZ1 Compact having an IP65/68 rating, which means it’ll even survive a dunk underwater.. We ran this phone under the tap and it survived the experience, which means your phone should be okay if it accidentally slips into the bathtub, or if you have it in the bathroom while you shower.. Despite being a good bit smaller than the Xperia XZ1, the XZ1 Compact retains that phone’s button and port layout. The volume rocker sits on the right-hand side of the phone, and we found this a little too small – it’s around the same size as the adjacent power button, so we regularly accidentally locked the phone rather than changing the volume.. The power button itself sits flush with the body of the device, and – unless you’re in the US – has a fingerprint scanner built in. We found this to work quickly, and as it sits where your thumb naturally falls on the device when it’s in your hand it’s easy to reach.. Note that ‘unless you’re in the US’ though. Inexplicably, and maddeningly, Sony has once again omitted the fingerprint sensor from the power key for the US market, limiting security options to a PIN or pattern. Exactly why Sony has chosen to do this remains unclear.. For colors you have the choice of Black, Snow Silver, Horizon Blue and Twilight Pink. We tested the Horizon Blue option – it’s a highly distinctive color compared to any other ‘blue’ phones we’ve used, and it certainly turned some heads.. The XZ1 Compact’s 4.6-inch display rocks a 720p HD resolution, which is standard for Sony’s Compact line and comfortably positions it against its main competitor, the iPhone SE; it may disappoint some, but we didn’t miss having a higher-resolution panel.. It’s a bright display and it’s colorful too – if Sony had opted for a Full HD panel it would have likely just impacted negatively on battery life, without adding greatly to the user experience.. If you like to play a lot of games and watch a lot of video on your phone you may find this smaller panel too small, but we liked the size of the screen, and it’s just right if you like to be able to use your phone one-handed..

Rated 4 out of. Android Oreo 8.0 with brilliant display. It's tough not to give this one 5 stars, but I do so because the US version of this phone has not enabled the fingerprint reader. it's just not enabled for the US market. Why? I don't know, but in all other aspects I love it. The Snapdragon processor is very zippy with Android Oreo 8.0 (one of the first phones to use this new operating system) and 4GB of RAM, this thing flies on 4G LTE networks. It's a great phone if you want two distinct numbers - using two different SIMS, or will be traveling internationally and want to get an international SIM for one slot and keep your US SIM in the other. The area where the SIMS are stored is kind of tricky to get into, but if you're gentle, you can get it done. Your microSD card (not included) can expand storage of the very generous 64GB to 128GB if desired. The cameras (front and back) are impressive. Take photos up to 19MP (you can change it in settings) with the rear facing camera and up to 13MP for the front. The rear camera is capable of slo-mo video up to 920fps in 6 second bursts. The phone can also take 3D images of your head, food, a car... and then you can either use it in AR software or send it off to get 3D printed. The 5.2 1080P HD display is beautiful! I love to watch YouTube or Netflix on my phone and the sharpness and detail are amazing. The sound is top notch too! There have been no disappointments in multimedia using this phone, and I am glad it still has a 3.5mm jack. I've used SIMs from ATT, T-Mobile, Simple Mobile and Cricket with this phone without issue. Metro PCS wouldn't recognize it - trying two different SIMs. (Not sure why as it's on the T-Mobile network.). In my opinion this is a very solid choice for a high-end Android phone. Call quality is very good, it has a delightful display that works very smoothly, and unlocked with 2 SIM slots is tough to beat. I've been a long time iPhone users who started with an Android phone. I thought I'd never go back, but this SONY Xperia XZ1 changed my mind. I wish the fingerprint security was enabled and the SIM drawers could be easier to get into, but overall - it's a winner.. Rated 5 out of. Everything works PERFECTLY!! I am so glad I bought this phone and everyone in B&H was super helpful and kind. I'll definetly come back and buy more stuff from them!.

http:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=19666. The Sony Xperia XZ1 is one of the first smartphones to run Android 8 Oreo. It packs the latest processor and camera technology into Sony's age-old, metal-and-glass chassis. While some table-stakes features are aboard, others are missing. This uneven effort from Sony has a lot going for it, but there's plenty holding it back. Here is Phone Scoop's full review.. The Xperia XZ1 is a high-end handset from Sony that crams top specs into a metal and glass chassis. Media features are its strengths, but there are some surprising gifts under its aluminum hood. Read on to find out what they are.. Much like Apple, Sony hasn't updated its smartphones' basic design language in half a decade. The XZ1 looks incredibly similar to the XZ, which looked incredibly similar to its predecessor and so on and so forth.. The design language used here is something Sony calls "Loop". The metal side edges are neatly curved and create a seamless "loop" when you view the phone's ends. The device still has the distinct corners that Sony's handsets are known for, which may make the phone uncomfortable in your pocket. The improvements in the design are small, but they do make for a more attractive and usable device.. Perhaps the best thing about the XZ1 is that it upgrades to an all-metal chassis. The entire rear panel is a seamless piece of material that wraps around the sides, creating a completely smooth contour. The 2.5D glass front panel fits into the frame nicely. The metal and glass combo is really appealing.. It has a smaller 5.2-inch screen, though the ridiculous bezels add a lot to the phone's footprint. Even so, it stands well under 6 inches tall and sits well under 3 inches wide. Almost everyone should be able to use the phone one-handed. The XZ1 is slim at 7.4mm, and slips into pockets just fine. The phone is roughly the same size as Samsung's Galaxy S8 and the LG G6, but with a smaller screen.. Sony has never skimped on quality, and the XZ1 is no exception. The glass front panel is exceptionally smooth under the thumb. The rounded metal chassis is perfectly shaped and mated to the glass and end caps seamlessly. The metal build of this year's phone is a huge improvement over the polycarbonate of the XZ. This is a flagship phone through and through, and Sony assembled it tightly.. The front face is all glass. As noted, Sony is one of the worst offenders when it comes to ugly bezels. There's nearly an inch of framing above and below the screen, with several millimeters on either side of the screen as well. The display is swimming in a too-big frame. It's a design from yesteryear that's beyond dated and needs to change. A hatch on the left edge covers the SIM/memory card tray. It's no trouble to find and use. I particularly like that you can pull it out without a tool; a fingernail will do. The rest of the controls are piled up on the right edge. The lock button is near the middle of the side edge. It's rather flat, but easy enough to find. The volume toggle is positioned above the screen lock key and works well. It has a slim profile and I like the travel and feedback. The dedicated camera button is where you expect to find such a key, at the bottom of the right edge. It's a two-stage control and functions perfectly.. The headphone jack is on top and the USB-C port is on the bottom.. There is no fingerprint reader in the U.S. version, a huge omission for a flagship phone.. The rear metal panel is perfectly flat. I like the quality of the paint and metal finish. The camera elements are tucked into the top-left corner. The round module sticks out about 1mm. It's much smaller than the camera bump on the iPhone 8/Plus. The phone has a laser to assist in focusing on your subject. The focus/flash array is positioned to the right of the camera module in a thin strip. The painted-on Xperia logo is hardly visible on the metal. The rear panel is a solid piece and cannot be removed, nor can the battery. It's incredibly plain, but I'd call that a bonus.. Like many Xperia handsets, the XZ1 is rated IP68 for protection against water and dust. It can sit in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes with no worries. That's a table-stakes feature for today's flagship smartphones and Sony nails it. I tested the XZ1 in the shower, in a bucket, in the local river, and other wet environs. I'm utterly bored with Sony's design language at this point, but the company does continue to manufacture quality hardware that functions as it should.. The 5.2-inch 1080p HD display is fine for what it is. The screen is bright, colorful, and clear. I think Sony is missing the boat with respect to the resolution, however, and it's past time Sony up its game. Most competing flagships have quad HD screens, which is much better for virtual reality. Sony told us it is skipping quad HD screens and will eventually go straight to ultra HD (4K) once they make more economic sense. We've already seen at least two 4K handsets from Sony, such as the XZ Premium released earlier this year. Those screens were incredibly impressive, though rather pricey. Many competing phones also have a screen with a 2:1 aspect ratio that fills more of the phone's face. For now, however, Sony is sticking with full HD resolution and the 16:9 aspect ratio.. The pixel density on the XZ1 is certainly good, thanks to the small size of the screen. Sony's slogan-y display tech (Bravia Engine, TriLuminos, et al.) doesn't appear to add much obvious real-world value. Viewing angles are good, and outdoor visibility is fine as long as you crank up the brightness.. Sony's software gives you a lot of control over how the screen behaves. For example, you can select from three different color profiles (adjusts saturation), as well as white balance. The display supports use with gloves, though you have to manually enable this setting.. Sony is selling the XZ1 unlocked in the U.S. It includes band 66 for T-Mobile, though not band 71. (At the moment, band 71 is only a big deal if you live in the sticks.). I tested the phone on both AT&T and T-Mobile in the NYC area and came away impressed. The phone handily latched onto AT&T and T-Mobile's 4G LTE networks and remained there throughout testing. Data speeds were robust, but didn't reach the peaks I've seen from other flagships. In real world terms, the XZ1 was able to stream video via YouTube and music via Spotify with no trouble. I saw little to no buffering and didn't experience any dropouts or pauses. Social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram all loaded content swiftly. As for making phone calls, the handset was able to connect on the first dial each time I made a call. The phone maintained calls over miles of highway driving perfectly.. I'd rate call quality as very good, but short of superb. The earpiece produces clean calls that are free of distortion and noise. People I spoke to through the XZ1 said I sounded excellent.. I wish volume were just a bit better. I had to keep the volume set to the max in order to hear calls at home, in the car, in coffee shops, and so on.. The speakerphone is more prone to distortion when cranked up, but holy hellfire can this phone get loud. Sony updated the amplifiers for its speakers, and sure enough, this phone pushes a lot of air. I had no trouble hearing speakerphone calls in noisy spaces. Ringers and alerts are jarringly noisy. The XZ1 has a 2,700 mAh battery tucked inside, which is definitely short of impressive. In fact, it's 10%-30% smaller than those of competing flagships. After several days of testing, it's clear that the battery is well-matched to the rest of the hardware. The result is a phone that I could barely kill during a day of rigorous testing. Most people should be pleased with the battery life they get from the XZ1. The majority of the time I used the phone it managed to make it from breakfast to bedtime, though with only a few percent to spare. If you tweak the settings a bit you might have more of a cushion at the end of the day.. The handset includes the base Android power-management tool. It can help a bit if you suddenly find yourself at 10%. The XZ1 also includes Sony's advanced battery tools, including extended modes. Activating the base Sony power-save mode automatically delivers hours of extra battery life by dimming the screen, adjusting radios, quieting notifications, and similar. If you bother with extreme mode, you'll easily score a half-day more from the battery because it shuts down all the but core apps.. More importantly, the XZ1 supports rapid charging technology for quick powerups. Sony claims plugging your phone into the included charger for just 30 minutes will give you an entire day's worth of battery life. I don't know about that, but the phone does charge crazy fast.. Due to the metal rear panel, the XZ1 does not support wireless charging.. The XZ1 has a good selection of secondary radios and they all perform really well.. When it came to connecting to headsets, speakers, cars, and other devices, the XZ1 got the job done. The phone paired with little effort. Phone calls passed through my car's hands-free system were adequate. Music, on the other hand, sounded amazing when streamed to my favorite headphones. The phone supports aptX HD, which is the newest high-resolution stereo Bluetooth codec. As long as you have a compatible piece of audio gear, expect to be impressed.. The GPS radio interacted well with Google Maps. The XZ1 was able to pinpoint my location within just a few seconds of opening the app, and accuracy was as good as about 20 feet. The phone managed real-time navigation with no trouble at all.. The NFC radio that's aboard the XZ1 helps it pair with Bluetooth accessories and also supports Android Pay.. Hands On with the Sony Xperia XZ1. Sony's latest flagship smartphone is the Xperia XZ1. The phone largely carries over the design we saw on last year's XZ handset, but manages to stuff the chassis with a slew of new and exciting camera tricks that make a compelling case for the XZ1..

Sony today announced the XZ1 and XZ1 Compact smartphones, two metal-clad flagships that pair novel features with classic Sony looks.

Sony Xperia XZ1, Xperia XZ Premium 3D Creator App Updated With Direct to Facebook Feature. Ankit Chawla , 22 February 2018. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The 3D creator app can upload 3D images to your Facebook timeline. Only these two flagship phones have received the update till now. Viewers can rotate, pinch, spin the uploaded image. Sony Mobiles on Thursday announced the rollout of an update for its 3D Creator app on its smartphones including the Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ Premium. In accordance with the update, users of these two phones will be able to upload their 3D scans on to their Facebook accounts using the 3D creator app. The update comes in the wake of Facebook introducing 3D posts and industry-standard "gITF 2.0" file format" that will enable creators to upload high quality 3D content on the social platform.. According to Sony, viewers of the 3D posts will be able to rotate, pinch, zoom in, and spin the images as per their preference. Sony's 3D creation app also allows users to convert people and objects into 3D avatars.. "3D creation is no longer just for professionals - 3D Creator by Sony has made it accessible to everyone and enabled 3D scanning in a matter of seconds and sharing in an instant. For existing XZ1, and XZ Premium users who have 3D Creator, the application can be updated through Google Play ," said Sony Mobiles in a press statement.. Facebook's gITF 2.0 compliance comes with support for various texture, lighting, and realistic rendering techniques that help enhance the quality of 3D posts on the platform. Add to that, these 3D images also support "unlit workflows" to enable stylised art. "In the future, we envision a seamless digital world where people can share immersive experiences and objects like these across VR , AR and Facebook News Feed. To get there, we'll work on supporting even higher quality 3D models, enabling interactive animations and bringing 3D content into the real world using AR," said Facebook in a statement on Tuesday..
