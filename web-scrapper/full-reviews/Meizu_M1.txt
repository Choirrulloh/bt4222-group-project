Lackluster speaker Design is far from unique Software is uninspired and lacks customization. The Meizu M1 Note stays true to its formula, providing a device with excellent specifications for an affordable price. Although, on the surface the device screams iPhone, once you get a bit deeper, you will realize that this is a decent Android device with great performance.. As amazing as high-end flagship devices are, there is an increasing demand for high quality, yet affordable, smartphones in the market.. Gone are the days when a low price point for a smartphone was indicative of a compromise in build quality or specifications, with various OEMs jumping in with a variety of options in this segment. While bigger names like Motorola certainly play this field, a great number of these low-price, high-quality offerings come from lesser known entities, mostly out of China.. One such company is Meizu, and today we’re going to be taking a closer look at one of their latest devices that fits this bill, in our full review of the Meizu M1 Note!. There’s no avoiding it, this phone is clearly inspired by Apple’s iPhone series, both on the hardware and software design front. The M1 Note features a unibody glossy polycarbonate design, with Meizu’s signature home button up front, which may look like what we get with the iPhone, but is capacitive in nature. The color of choice, white in the case of this review unit, is found on the back and wraps around its sides.. Up top is the power button and the headphone jack, and on the bottom you’ll find the speaker grill and the microUSB port. A dual-SIM card slow and volume rocker can be found on the right and light sides, respectively. The buttons share the same materials as the back of the device, though they are raised just enough to make them easy to locate. The buttons also offer a solid tactile feedback, with a button press covering a lot of ground.. The glossy plastic back is aesthetically rather plain and simplistic, with only the camera and dual-tone flash to be found, accompanied by the Meizu logo at the bottom, followed by a tag, “Designed by Meizu. Made in China.” It’s also worth noting that the back is non-removable, so there is no access to the battery. The curve on the back along the sides which is a result of the wraparound design contributes to the grip, with the glossy plastic not as slippery as one would expect at first glance.. The 5.5-inch M1 Note doesn’t share the same impressive screen-to-body-ratio as its flagship counterparts, and as such, does fall just outside the realm of a very comfortable handling experience though.. The curve on the back along the sides, which is a result of the wraparound design, contributes to the phone’s grip, with the glossy plastic not as slippery as one would expect at first glance.. The 5.5-inch M1 Note doesn’t share the same impressive screen-to-body-ratio as its flagship counterparts, and as such is a bit bigger than many folks might be comfortable with when it comes to handling experience.. On the display front you get a 5.5-inch IGZO display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 401 ppi,which is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 panel. This is a very bright and vivid display, with colors and text that pops. Granted, there are times when the colors are a bit warm, with a slightly yellowish hue, but that isn’t going to be too noticeable in most cases. Viewing angles are fantastic on this display as well, with the device providing a consistent picture, no matter what angle you are holding it at. You will have a great time doing just about anything on this display, including watching videos or playing games.. Under the hood, the Meizu M1 Note packs an octa-core 64-bit MediaTek MT6752 processor, clocked at 1.7 GHz, and backed by the Mali-T760 GPU and 2 GB of RAM. While MediaTek processors haven’t received the best of reviews when compared to the Snapdragons of the world, the company is certainly catching up, as we see in the case of the M1 Note.. Navigating around the various elements of the user interface is an enjoyable experience, and opening and closing applications feels just as quick as what we see with the latest flagships. General tasks are carried out with little issue, and even gaming is handled admirably, with a few instances of slowdown only during the most graphic-intensive of sequences. Benchmark test results may not be the most impressive, as you can see below, but when it comes to real world performance, at the very least, the device feels about on par with flagships that were available last year.. The M1 Note offers a standard suite of connectivity options, including support for 4G LTE. That said, while the device was able to connect to the AT&T network, the connection was not the most stable, and data speeds were quite slow, limiting my use to Google Hangouts and some web browsing. If you do decide to pick up this device, don’t forget to check the compatibility with your network carrier before taking the plunge.. As mentioned, the single speaker is found at the bottom of the device. While it does get plenty loud, it lacks crispness. Using it during a call on speakerphone, or while doing anything in the portrait orientation, is fine, but things do get muffled when in landscape, as it is quite easy to cover up.. On the battery front, the M1 Note packs a large 3,140 mAh battery, but battery life was still quite average, getting about a full day’s life with average use. Of course, the higher battery drain rate may be a result of the device having a difficulty in maintaining a network connection, so your mileage will likley vary.. For a lot of consumers, the camera is the most important aspect when it comes to their smartphones, and the Meizu M1 Note brings a decent performer to the table, with its 13 MP rear camera with a dual LED flash, and a 5 MP front-facing unit.. The images that you get with this camera are quite good, even if it isn’t really comparable to what you’d expect from a flagship device. It definitely gets the job done, and is more than just a passable camera. What the M1 Note lacks in image quality, Meizu makes up for in the camera software. The M1 Note has a manual camera mode built in, allowing anyone who has an understanding of photography to take fantastic photos. Of course, this isn’t going to replace your DSLR, but the ability to play around with the settings lets you get just that little bit extra out of the smartphone camera experience.. It’s also important to mention that the Auto mode on the camera does allow for some really good shots when outdoors or in good lighting conditions. As expected, the quality worsens in deteriorating lighting conditions, and you will need to depend on the manual mode to properly cater a shot to your liking. Other standard camera modes are also available, such as panorama and HDR, a beauty mode, as well as the ability to shoot slow motion video. When it comes to shooting video, the quality is just about standard, with no manual controls available to you, along with the audio losing clarity even when just a few feet away from the camera.. Overall, this is more than a decent smartphone camera, and certainly not what you’d expect from a device available at this price point.. The Meizu M1 Note is running Android 4.4.4 Kitkat, with Meizu’s Flyme OS on top. An update to Android 5.1 is expected sometime in the not-too-distant future, but no exact timeframe has been revealed just yet. Meizu’s Apple ‘inspiration’ isn’t just limited to design, making its way over to the user interface as well, noticeable in the design of the various icons, as well as in the fact that an app drawer isn’t available, leaving you dependent on folders to keep things organized.. Starting with the lock screen, you can unlock the device with a simple tap or swipe up on the home button, or with a swipe up on the lock screen. Swiping to right or left directly opens the camera application or Quick Applications respectively.. Going into the Settings menu, all the settings you’d expect are available, but are in different locations and with different icons. The general Android user may require some time to get used to this layout, and as such, the Flyme OS does have a learning curve to it. Of course, if things get too cumbersome, you always have the option of third party launchers available from the Google Play Store, which will help alleviate some of the UI’s issues.. The Meizu M1 Note is available from Amazon priced at $260, but as mentioned, don’t forget to check for compatibility with your network carrier before picking one up.. So there you have it – a closer look at the Meizu M1 Note! Meizu has really stepped up their game in this segment, offering great phones at a very affordable price point when compared to the competition. The M1 Note doesn’t do too much in terms of design and features, but it still a solid smartphone for a very aggressive price.. Please enter a valid email address. Android Authority APP Get it on.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Front-facing camera 5 megapixels 3.7 megapixels. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor.

System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. 20.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Music playback 60.00 hours 82.00 hours. Video playback 15.00 hours 14.00 hours. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by Album, Artist, Playlists Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. FCC ID value: A3LSMN910C link. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $229 Buy.

Featured Review: Meizu M1 Note – More Bang for Your Buck. 16GB or 32GB internal storage, no microSD card support. Android 4.4.4 , Flyme 4.0 skin. 150.7mm tall x 75.2mm wide x 8.9mm thick. March 15, 2015 - Written By Nick Sutrich. for Chinese manufacturer Meizu, who had traditionally only released one flagship phone per year. Fall 2014 brought about two flagships from the growing company, and in December they announced a new budget-minded phone. designed to usher in a new crowd of Meizu owners. Meizu has traditionally focused on the higher-end spec race in the smartphone market while providing more of a mid-range price for its devices, but the M1 Note is going to cost half of that all while sacrificing very little. Today we’re giving you the full review of Meizu’s first budget-friendly phone, which is available for around $220, or about half the cost of the Meizu MX4.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. $200 phones are getting more and more impressive these days, and Meizu’s M1 Note is no slouch at all. Meizu’s latest competition, the iOcean Rock M6752, features the same chipset and extremely similar specs for the same price, trading off things like battery size for extra RAM and a slightly different build. In terms of specs this is right in line with what iOcean. has made us expect, so check them out for yourself:. One of the most surprising features of the Meizu M1 Note is the display, which is one of the few. consumer level phones to carry Sharp’s IGZO displays. We haven’t seen too many devices with this type of display, as manufacturers usually prefer to use an IPS LCD or AMOLED display in their products. IGZO displays use Indium gallium zinc oxide as a semiconductor instead of silicon. give the display the ability to pack more information in the same space because of their higher electron mobility. This is useful for increasing resolution as well as requiring less power since light more easily travels through the materials. IGZO displays can also have much higher response times than LCD displays can.. Meizu’s use of IGZO is interesting because it doesn’t push any resolution boundaries in the mobile world, and the refresh rate of the display is just as poor as the displays used in the MX4 and MX4 Pro. That means you’re going to see obvious ghosting when moving things around on the screen, including scrolling through the UI, playing games, watching movies, etc. It’s not a deal breaker but it’s annoying, especially to anyone sensitive to latency issues like this. On the bright side the display is in fact quite bright and very visible outdoors. Colors are punchy, contrast is fantastic and the black levels are every bit as good as those found on the MX4 and MX4 Pro, which are among the best I’ve ever seen on a non-OLED display. Viewing angles are absolutely phenomenal and just about everything else I could praise a display for is wrapped up in this neat little package. Touch sensitivity is off the charts too, and ranks among the most responsive mobile displays I’ve ever used. The phone feels ultra responsive and quite a bit of it likely has to do with this.. As a cheaper phone the Meizu M1 Note features much cheaper materials than the MX4 or MX4 Pro, but that doesn’t mean it actually feels like a cheap phone. Many phones at this price range opt for the shiny plastic backs that many have come to loathe, and why this particular trend continues is beyond me. That of course is the case here as the M1 Note has an ultra shiny, non-removable back that looks extraordinarily similar to an iPhone 5c. Everything from the colors available to the shape of the overall phone, the circular capacitive home button and even the bottom speaker grille looks like an iPhone. Without any sort of closer inspection, there’s no doubt that this will be mistaken for an iPhone 10 out of 10 times.. That being said the phone doesn’t actually feel cheap, and that comes from Meizu’s quality construction. Everything here feels solid, from the clicks of the volume and power buttons to the overall solid feel of the device. Many phones in this price range feel slightly hollow or overly light, but this phone somehow both feels super light and well built. At 8.9mm thin this isn’t the thinnest phone in the world but it’s nowhere near being considered thick either. All the edges of the device, including the back corners, are super smooth and slick. They make the device feel a little more premium than it actually is priced at and feel really good in the hand. Meizu is using some pretty small bezels here between the edge of the phone and the screen, giving this a slightly smaller frame than many other 5.5-inch display phones out there.. On the right side of the device, you’ll find the dual SIM tray, which actually fits two SIM cards inside of it at the same time. Up top is a 3.5mm headset jack and a super awkwardly placed volume button. doubles as a power button as well for turning the screen off, and also functions as the notification light. The left side of the phone holds both volume buttons, which are separated instead of being a unified volume rocker as many other Android phones have, and feel absolutely excellent thanks to the solid click they make when pressed. The bottom of the device holds the microUSB port and the single small speaker. On back you’ll find the camera and dual-tone dual-LED flash, while the front of the device features only a single circular home button.. If someone were to hand you this phone and ask you how much it cost, there’s a likelihood you wouldn’t guess in the range of $200. That’s because the Meizu M1 Note doesn’t feel anything like a cheap phone in any way, especially not in the performance aspect. This phone is every bit as fast, if not faster, than many high-end phones I’ve used. Apps launch in a split second, multi-tasking is lightning fast, and even though it’s “only” got 2GB of RAM I never once saw an app reload or redraw when moving back and forth between them. Swiping up from either side of the home button brings up the multi-tasking menu, which is unfortunately just a row of 4 icons with the app’s name under the icon. I didn’t have too tough of a time identifying which apps were running but having the thumbnail appear above the app would have made things significantly easier to identify what’s running rather than trying to remember what the app’s icon looks like.. In terms of gaming performance I was utterly impressed with the performance of this device. Every single game I tried ran like a dream, which is impressive given the price and the fact that this is a full HD 1080p screen. Performance with a resolution like this is usually only reserved for phones twice this price. Games like Assassin’s Creed Pirates, Temple Run 2 and Into the Dead ran like a dream, just to name a few ones that were tested. The only exception I ran into was. Brothers in Arms 3, which seems to have a problem with MediaTek chips in general as it performs equally as horrible on other phones with other MediaTek chipsets I’ve used as well. There’s really nothing of note to improve here performance wise, and there’s no reason someone wouldn’t be completely happy with how this phone performs even if it were a more expensive device than it is.. Some people have become worried by the trend of including non-removable batteries in phones, and if that’s something that is a deal breaker then you’re going to have a problem here. Meizu has tried to mitigate the problem of not being able to carry around a spare battery by including a rather generous. 3,140mAh battery, which is the same size found in powerhouse phones like the Galaxy Note 4 and Nexus 6. Having a chipset that’s should theoretically be more energy efficient than those phones helps things too, and the IGZO display should cut down on energy usage as well. In practice I didn’t find the battery to be any better or worse than the aforementioned phones, which means it gets a full days’ battery life no matter what you do.. I was able to play intensive 3D games, stream music, chat all day on Hangouts, make phone calls and still make it home with 25% battery left at the end of the day on my first day of using the phone, and that trend continued in subsequent days. Super heavy users may have to turn down the brightness or carry an external power supply around with them, but most people won’t have any issues with the battery life here.. In my experience T-Mobile’s US network doesn’t always play well with Chinese phones, and while I didn’t have as many problems with the Meizu M1 Note as I’ve had with some other Chinese phones I’ve reviewed, the experience was far from flawless. While using the phone the call quality was just fine, and I was actually impressed with the signal strength of the phone as I was able to move through most areas where T-Mobile’s network has poor reception without dropping a call. In general AT&T’s network will have better compatibility here, as it shares plenty of the same spectrum with Chinese carriers. The M1 Note also includes dual-SIM capability for countries that need and support that sort of thing, with robust support for SIM management.. Data was the biggest issue for me though as I found myself constantly getting disconnected from T-Mobile’s network and having to reset the radio on the device. When I did have a data connection it was a solid one though, pulling down great speeds from T-Mobile’s HSPA+ network. I also had issues with WiFi networks not staying active while the phone was idle, forcing me to wait a couple of seconds after turning the screen on until data was active again. This was sporadic but consistent no matter what WiFi device I connected to, and I assume would likely be fixed in a software update.. The Meizu M1 Note we used for this review was packing Flyme OS V4.2 (pronounced fly-me), which is a slightly newer version than what was on the Meizu MX4 Pro when we reviewed it. There were no obvious software distinctions versus that phone, so please check that review for the full overview of what Meizu brings to the table. In general though as was discussed in the performance section there’s almost nothing to complain about here outside of the usual oddities that Chinese manufacturers tend to create when changing up Android as much as they do.. We’ll just take a quick look at some of the things that makes Meizu different from other manufacturers. First up is the most obvious thing: the home button. Meizu only uses a single home button and nothing else on the face of the device, making this completely unique from other Android phones out there. Pressing home does what it sounds like, while swiping up on the home button acts like pressing the back button normally would. Swiping up from the bezel on either side of the home button opens up multi-tasking, and holding down home while the screen is on shuts the screen off and locks the device.. The notification shade is a little bit different from other Android phones in that some of the quick toggles, like WiFi and Bluetooth, actually have an expandable menu to quickly connect to other devices. Oddly enough there’s no quick way to get to phone settings, which is annoying to say the least, but you can change around the default buttons and choose from 15 in total to display. Also to note another oddity is the way volume is controlled on the phone. The volume rockers adjust media volume at all times no matter what you’re doing, so adjusting the volume is done only by going into settings. This is annoying to say the least and needs to change in a future version of Flyme OS for sure.. Users will also find that when using a 3rd party keyboard on some apps, like Hangouts for instance, that trying to fix a word or move the cursor simply doesn’t work. You need to put the keyboard away to move the cursor, and it has something to do with the built-in system keyboard on the phone. Gaining root access and removing the system keyboard completely fixes the issue, or you could just use the built-in keyboard if that works well enough for you. This is a bug that is known and will hopefully be fixed in a future update as well.. The Meizu M1 Note features a single speaker on the bottom of the device, ensuring that your hand cupped around the bottom echoes the sound better than a speaker on the back would. That doesn’t mean this is really any better quality than most single back speakers that you would find on plenty of Android device out there, just better placed. The speaker itself is loud enough to where using loudspeaker on a phone call was audible even in my truck on the highway. Listening to other audio such as YouTube videos was perfectly fine on this speaker, as the clarity and volume were adequate.. The DAC on the Meizu M1 Note seems to be better than many other phones in the $200 ballpark, but that doesn’t mean it can compete with many in phones more expensive. Something has to give to fit this price point and this is one obvious place. The audio output was passable at best on a higher end sound system, whereas I found it to be adequate on a lesser quality sound system. There’s a built in equalizer but since this doesn’t seem to be a very high powered amp inside the phone adjusting any of the levels in the EQ just lowered the volume. There’s also a DAC setting in the music app for certain headphone brands and models, but none of them were sufficient to improve the sound in my truck. This phone certainly wouldn’t be my first choice to listen to music on, but it’s passable with cheaper earbuds or other lower quality sound systems.. When you think $200 phone you normally don’t think great camera, but the Meizu M1 Note is here to change that completely. 13-megapixel sensors are common even in the cheapest of Android phones out there, but there’s a level of quality that comes with a better sensor that you’ll find here. There’s very little noise even in lower lighting, and the overall color reproduction is absolutely stellar. Meizu’s denoise filter isn’t too harsh although I did find that in some lighting conditions it can tend to cause some haloing on certain parts of the image, especially when zoomed in. Overall I’d put this right up there with the camera on the Galaxy S4 or Note 3, except with much faster shutter speeds, resulting in significantly better low light imaging with less blur.. On a negative note HDR is yet again nearly useless as it is on all other Meizu phones. I don’t know what Meizu’s issue with HDR is but the way photos are taken is simply too slow for all but the brightest lighting conditions (i.e. It’s painfully obvious that exposure bracketing is used here, and the camera is very slow to change exposure, leading to long shutter times and plenty of double imaging in most HDR photos. On a positive note there are some really interesting options here including a mode to take a shot with all items in focus and refocus after the shots is taken. There’s also slow motion video and up to 1080p 30FPS video too, all of which were great quality. Since there’s no optical image stabilization video can be a little shaky in some situations, but it’s nothing we haven’t seen before on plenty of other Android phones, and certainly not expected at this price range. Overall this is bar none the best camera I’ve seen on a budget phone without hesitation. Check out the gallery below and see if you agree!. For $220 I absolutely wouldn’t recommend any other phone on the market, so long as you’re not on T-Mobile or one of their MVNO’s of course. You’re getting a phenomenal build for the price and a great looking phone at that, but it’s definitely going to make some people think you’ve got an iPhone if you’re OK with that sort of thing. The camera is absolutely the best in this price class, and the display is top-notch as well. Performance is by far the best in this category and competes even with phones double the price or more. Meizu’s Flyme OS is unique and has its quirks, but it’s ultra fast, responsive and can be very pretty too. My biggest complaint is the sound output, which could be better, especially when used on higher-end sound systems.. As always we recommend 1949deal.com as a trusted place to get the Meizu M1 Note if you are interested in getting it. For the 16GB model they have the white version , blue version , yellow version.

Menu Android iOS Reviews Features How-to About Contact us YouTube Podcast Social Instagram Feed Facebook Twitter. Leigh Geary July 29, 2015. So this has surprised me in a way. When it first arrived the box itself didn’t exactly scream “premium”. I mean, there’s nothing really wrong with the box per se, but I’ve got used to some of the recent review phones turning up in carefully sculpted containers that wouldn’t look out of place in a jewellers.. However, after opening it up I’m met with classy handset with a blue rear and a bright, vivid 5.5″ screen at 1920 x 1080. The comments I’ve received so far range from “that’s a bit different” to “parts of it look like an iPhone”. I guess that’s a reference to the circular action key at the bottom, which glows when there’s a notification you need to be looking at. This little touch alone has saved me a lot of “screen checking” time and has helped to lengthen the battery life, which is very decent anyway. I’m writing this at 2PM and there’s 59% left. I’ve been absolutely hammering the thing all day to test it and yet I’ve still got 59% battery. Turning on the device is a slightly different experience to most Android devices. This has a UI on it called “Flyme”, which is actually known here as an OS even though it’s running Android 4.4.4 at the core.. It’s perhaps a little dated, and me mentioning that may put you off. The Flyme interface, which also asks for a login during setup (I skipped this and it didn’t affect my experience one bit) really helps here and gives the handset a modern and clean appearance which made regular tasks simple and quick. It positively slides along as if on rails and is minimalistic in appearance.. Before I get to all that though, let’s have a look at the specs. This device comes in two versions – 16GB and 32GB of storage. There’s no microSD card slot but you do get two SIM card slots. I found that one of these was 2G only. It runs a Mediatek MT6752 octa-core CPU at 1.7GHz and has a Mali T760 GPU with 2GB RAM. It’ll do 4G, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS.. Meanwhile, around the back, there’s a 13 megapixel Samsung camera with flash (f2.2). On the full 13 megapixels this’ll produce square images, so I had to notch it down to 9 megapixels to get the full wide-screen shots. Up front there’s a 5 megapixel cam for your selfie shots. It has a 3140mAh battery which you can’t remove.. The rear section wraps neatly and smoothly around the sides and top of the handset like a cover. It’s a smooth shiny plastic but there’s very little play or bending in the phone construction. Up front, the black border around the screen is kept to an acceptable minimum and there’s that circular action / notification key. In addition to this there’s also (when required) two on-screen buttons towards the bottom of the display for going back or opening menu options. Although this might seem a little disjointed it really wasn’t.. The left edge has the volume controls, which sit out proudly but with a certain sense of style.. On the other side, the SIM tray that’ll house two SIM cards it you have them. If not, one is fine, but no microSD here. We couldn’t find NFC while I think about it either.. The bottom has the external speaker, microphone and microUSB charging point. You can see how rounded the edges are here too.. Then up top, the 3.5mm audio port, power button (I hardly ever pressed that because I used the “double-tap to wake” function on the screen) and a noise-cancelling microphone.. The setup process isn’t strictly aimed at little ‘ole me in the UK, and the browser and some other apps have Chinese options and features. It’s not a job-stopper and the browser rendered pages reasonably well, although there were a few slight discrepancies with the font sizes on some pages. I quickly installed Chrome and felt quite at home.. Using this as my daily driver didn’t feel much different to my LG G3 in terms of performance. It chugged along quite happily and somehow kept up with my abuse without complaint. As mentioned, it also had the same “double-tap to wake” functionality that I’ve become accustomed to, so there wasn’t really a need to press the power button on the side.. Once you’ve got past the brief and painless setup process you’re dropped straight into the main screen. All apps and games are stored in the main tray, so there’s no real “drawer” to pull down to access others. The icons have received a bit of a facelift and some polish thanks to the Flyme OS tweaks, but you can disable this and have normal icons if you wish. I was quite taken with the Flyme ones so I kept them on.. Here’s a quick look at how the icons differ if you have the Flyme style enabled (right) or disabled (left)... I then had to get my Google account setup because this actually isn’t part of the setup process. After going into the settings and adding this account I got all my contacts and calendar appointments, but there was no email.. At first I found this strange, but then you realise that certain other Google bits aren’t installed. Out of the box Google Play is – thankfully – on the homescreen, so no need to side-load apps. So is Google Maps, however, there’s no Gmail or YouTube. This is quickly rectified by simply downloading the relevant apps from Google Play. I grabbed the Google Mail app and YouTube and everything worked pretty smoothly.. There’s a couple of other minor bits you’ll need to get used to, like the text selection process. With this particular handset you need to press and hold, choose “Select” and then drag over the text. It’s a little gear change, but you soon get used to it. The TouchPal keyboard is pre-installed and works well, although I switched it to my favourite Google one which offers similar functionality.. On a software level Meizu have also added a music app which lets you create playlists and navigate your tunes. There’s also a voice recorder, update checker, a “Security Center” for cleaning and maintaining your phone, a paint app and… that’s about it. To be honest this fitted me nicely just like that. It didn’t have a huge chunk of apps, features and services I didn’t want. It left the decisions up to me on what I wanted, and I liked that.. The Settings screens were where I spent most of the time. There’s a range of gestures you can setup – I’ve already mentioned the “double-tap to wake” function, but you can also set the phone to do other things when you make certain gestures. For example, writing the letter “e” on the screen could open your email client if you wanted – it’s totally up to you. There’s a host of other options including an auto power off / on, a network speed notification and the possibility to start certain apps if you sweep right on the lock screen. You may want to start the camera for example.. The rear camera is billed as a 13 megapixel shooter and indeed it is that, but all shots will be square in appearance. If you want to have the standard landscape option you’ll need to knock things down to 9 megapixels.. The whole camera UI is very nice and there’s a range of filters and effects that you can apply to the live preview. You can also use a countdown timer plus you’ll find HDR, a level gauge and gridlines. Plus, if you switch to the “manual mode” (which looks a lot like the Google Mail icon) you can adjust nearly every photography geeky setting going.. Other modes include panorama, light field, scan (for grabbing scans by snapping an image), beauty (which didn’t make me look a great deal younger) and slowmotion.. It’s also possible to record video and pause it, so your final video is nicely slotted together with multiple shots throughout. Also, as you film, you can snap images. Ideal if you’re filming a family event and want to grab shots at the same time.. Below I’ve added some example shots. The images came out relatively well. The focus took a little longer in lower light and, although it wasn’t a top-end performer, images looked good enough to me and the camera fired up quickly with a fairly brisk focus time. Although HDR is available I did find that it wouldn’t always remember my preference, so I’d get in the habit of checking whether it was enabled.. This one was taken with HDR enabled... A nice punchy design that reminded me of the Windows Phone Nokia handsets to begin with, but inside there’s an uncluttered and rather beautiful interface which is a joy to use. It’s a handset that doesn’t dictate what apps you should have – instead choosing to deliver the minimum range of apps whilst you make it your own. It’s like moving into a really nice new house and making it your own, deciding where the fireplace, sofa and dinner table should go.. It was quick, performed well, had great battery life and felt in no way cheap. I liked the little touches such as being able to swap applications just by sweeping up from the bottom of the screen. It has a lot of the premium features but this is a handset that costs £165 from Topresellerstore.co.uk. Sadly it’s out of stock at that particular store but they do have the new Meizu M2 Note which is (wait for it) just £149! That’s utterly bonkers for a well-made device which could actually be my daily driver. I can actually see myself popping two SIM cards into this and quite happily using it in place of my regular “premium” smartphone. Even if the majority of the people I showed this to had never heard of the company, it’s still a very capable handset for the money.. So this has surprised me in a way. When it first arrived the box itself didn't exactly scream "premium".
