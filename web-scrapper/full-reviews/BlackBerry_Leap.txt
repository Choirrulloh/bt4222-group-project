CNET también está disponible en español.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The BlackBerry Leap smartphone is a plain workhorse with BlackBerry's productivity and security pedigree.. The Bad The Amazon app store is missing many popular apps found on Google Play, or Apple's iOS app store.. The Bottom Line The BlackBerry Leap ditches a physical keyboard to lure folks looking for a modern smartphone experience, but a lack of apps and a lackluster camera keep this device behind the competition.. Design 5-inch display, 1,280x720-pixel resolution, 293ppi (pixel density) 144x72.8x9.5mm (5.67 inches by 2.87 inches by 0.37 inch) 170 grames (6 ounces). Software and features BlackBerry OS 10.3.1 Support for Amazon's Android app store BlackBerry World app store You'll get your apps from BlackBerry World and the Amazon app store. The Hub is a home for all of your conversations. Performance and battery life 1.5GHz Qualcomm 8960 dual-core processor, 2GB RAM 2,800mAh battery 16GB storage, supports up to 128GB microSD The SIM and microSD card slots are readily accessible. BlackBerry has long been a byword for mobile security and productivity, and that isn't going to change with the BlackBerry Leap. Available unlocked for $275, or £199 in the UK (about AU$394), this phone pays homage to BlackBerry's business-focused ethos in every way except one: there's no keyboard.. For good or ill, the physical keyboard on BlackBerry's last few devices relegated those phones to a rather specific niche. But in striking out the platform's chief differentiator, we're left with a 5-inch touchscreen device with a meager camera that's hobbled by a limited, lackluster platform that just can't stand up to Android or iPhone competitors.. Up close with the BlackBerry Leap (pictures). The BlackBerry Leap is a plain black slab that looks and feels professional, in a quaint sort of way. There isn't much in the way of flourishes or adornments here, just a 5-inch edge-to-edge display and the BlackBerry badge running along the bottom. The textured pattern on the back keeps the phone appreciably grippy.. The right side of the phone hosts the volume controls and the BlackBerry Assistant button, which calls up BlackBerry's virtual assistant, the company's take on Apple's Siri, Android's Google Now and Microsoft's Cortana. You'll find the headphone jack and lock button up top, while the cover on the left hides the SIM card slot and the microSD slot -- it can support up to 128GB cards. The cover is kind of a pain to open and I generally kept a paper clip nearby to help get the cards in and out.. The Leap's 5-inch display with a 1,280x720-pixel resolution -- that's a bit low for a display this size, but the screen looks great: colors are vivid and accurate, and didn't shift no matter how I held the display. The Leap is also kind of chunky, and heavier than it looks at 6 ounces (170 grams), but you certainly won't have trouble toting it about.. What's definitely different here: there's no keyboard. BlackBerry Passport and BlackBerry Classic were divisive devices, each making sacrifices to form and functionality to fit a QWERTY keyboard onto a modern smartphone. But as problematic as those keyboards were in a world populated by 5-inch devices and apps that need room to roam, they remain an important part of the BlackBerry experience.. Of course BlackBerry has made plenty of touchscreen-only devices. But without a physical keyboard, the Leap doesn't do much to stand out. Having access to Android apps by way of the Amazon app store remains one of the best features. With it, BlackBerry users get a taste of the apps available on Android. But it's only a taste -- the app selection is woefully limited when compared with what you'll find in the official Google Play store. App compatibility also isn't guaranteed, and in some cases -- like the game Crossy Road -- Android apps failed to load at all. That said, you'll also have access to apps from the BlackBerry World store, and if you happen to have the APK file for the app you want to install, you can load that up too.. The notion of getting your "serious" apps from BlackBerry World and then trawling the Amazon app store for entertainment isn't lost on me, but if you're looking for a well-rounded device, you'd do better on a platform that's seen more widespread support from developers.. The rest of the BlackBerry OS 10 experience is identical to what we saw in the BlackBerry Passport. The focus on productivity and security won't disappoint folks who work at companies that demand heavy security. But platforms like Android and iOS will offer more choice.. We'll start with the typing experience. The Leap's virtual keyboard is fast and accurate, and has a great text suggestion function that superimposes recommendations right onto the keyboard -- just swipe on a word to slide it in, saving precious screen space. But Android and more recently, iOS, let you choose -- from a decidedly wide variety -- whatever keyboard is right for you, which is arguably more important for most users.. Then there's BlackBerry Hub, which puts all of your mail, texts and messages in one readily accessible place. It could certainly help you keep an eye on everything that's incoming, but individual apps still excel when it comes time to actually respond to anyone. Doubly so if you're using a platform that isn't supported, like Google Hangouts.. You can fire up the BlackBerry Assistant by holding the button on the side, and it'll answer questions, set reminders and do all kinds of helpful things. But we've had Google Now and iOS's Siri and Windows Phone's Cortana for some time now. And those platforms are poised to take things quite a bit further: Google Now will soon offer. much greater contextual awareness , Siri is about ready to control some of your home appliances and Cortana is bringing her witty banter to just about every device you own .. There are quite a few features you'll only find on BlackBerry devices, and while they don't disappoint, they're largely limited to companies that are enmeshed in the BlackBerry ecosystem. Consider BlackBerry Balance, available to companies. Balance lets you create distinct work and personal workspaces on the device, so you can keep your work files and messages distinct from your personal life, without needing to juggle multiple devices.. And then there's BlackBerry Blend, which serves as a sort of command center for BlackBerry users. It's an app that will give you nearly full control over your BlackBerry from another device -- you'll be able to check on and compose emails or messages, keep tabs on your appointments and access files and your corporate network without navigating VPNs and the like. The Blend app is available for PCs, Macs and iOS and Android devices and is designed to keep your data secure, potentially turning your phone into a pocket workstation when you're on the go.. The Leap is powered by a dual-core 1.5GHz Qualcomm 8960 paired with 2GB of RAM. You'll also find 16GB of storage space, bolstered by support for up to 128GB microSD cards. This loadout is identical to that of the. BlackBerry Classic , and the performance is right in line with that keyboard-equipped device. Swiping through menus and firing up the native apps is effortless, and I never felt like the phone's hardware got in the way.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Report: BlackBerry lays off a third of its Waterloo staff (Updated). BlackBerry Leap review: an old phone with a fresh face. BlackBerry aims at young professionals with the low-cost Leap. This isn't the last we've heard of Samsung buying BlackBerry. BlackBerry Leap review: an old phone with a fresh face. Two years ago, BlackBerry finally broke free of the monotonous cycle it had entrenched itself in by launching its first all-touchscreen device, the Z10. Despite it being a costly flop , the company formerly known as RIM has continued to explore touchscreen territory with the help of its poke-friendly BB10 OS. BlackBerry is no longer a stranger to the form factor: It quickly followed up the Z10 with the Z30 , and now the new BlackBerry Leap. There's little that separates BlackBerry's three main touchscreen devices as far as internals are concerned, and therein lies the main problem with the Leap. Instead of trying something different, BlackBerry has kept well within its comfort zone and pushed out another mid-range, touchscreen handset that's marginally divergent from its predecessors. Don't get me wrong: If a Leap lands on your desk to replace an old work phone, you'll no doubt get on with it just fine. But, if your own money is on the table, you're probably going to want to take it elsewhere.. Gallery: BlackBerry Leap review | 23 Photos. BB10 OS is a great productivity tool. There are several things to like about the BlackBerry Leap, including its long battery life, surprisingly good camera and the productivity afforded by BB10 OS. It can be cumbersome to use due to its size;its 720p display is of substandard quality;and even some of the most popular apps aren’t available on the BB10 platform directly. And, almost unforgivably, the phone makes do with aging internals, making it identical on the inside to the two-year-old BlackBerry Z10. Frankly, it’s impossible to recommend the Leap over cheaper handsets with superior specifications and more consumer-friendly platforms. As a work phone, the Leap will more than cut it, but if you’re looking for a personal device that isn’t solely for keeping up with email, you can do better.. Let's be frank: BlackBerry isn't known for inspired design. The recent keyboard-toting Classic is almost an admission of that, it being a regression for the company; an homage to the Bold devices that found popularity many moons ago. Even the Porsche Design collaborations , the pocket-stretching Passport and the as-yet unreleased, curved-screen slider are all variations on a weary theme. That being said, the new Leap is at least a stark change from the two touchscreen BlackBerrys that came before it. The company isn't exactly breaking the mold, though: The Leap takes more than a few design cues from the BlackBerry Z3 , a lower-end touchscreen device that has only been released in a few developing markets.. Distancing itself from the soft curves of the Z series, the Leap is a real blunt object of a phone. It's a black and gray slab with sharp corners, meant for serious business, and I can't help but find it lacking in character -- unless that character is a middle manager at a logistics conglomerate. There are positives and negatives to this "all work, no play" design. On the one hand, it looks and feels like you could hammer nails with it. That's to say it's solid as a rock, to the extent that the body won't flex or twist, even under considerable pressure. The build quality is admirable: All the parts fit together snugly, though the seams around the glass frontage are prone to trapping dust and lint. Also, the dimpled, rubbery material that covers most of the device feels like a built-in shock case, giving the impression that the handset can shrug off a fall or two.. On the other hand, however, the Leap being a solid square block makes it a tad cumbersome in the hand. Sure, the dimpled back, with its slight curvature as it meets the sides, gives ample purchase and comfort; but, the device is tall, wide, thick and verging on heavy at 170g (six ounces). The Leap's 5-inch display is flanked on all sides by healthy bezels, and while my spidery hands didn't struggle to manipulate the device, my thumb was always leaning over dead space to get at the screen. I was constantly shifting my hand position so my thumb could reach the edges of the display, primarily because the BlackBerry 10 OS is centered around several swiping gestures that have to start off-screen. This serves to reinforce the feeling that the Leap is huge for a 5-inch device; the power button's central placement on the top edge next to the headphone jack doesn't help much either.. The volume rocker -- or rather, the two volume keys on either side of the BlackBerry Assistant button -- is more sensibly placed toward the top of the right edge, and the micro-USB port is exactly where you'd expect at the base of the device. Since the Leap's back panel is fixed (the battery is nonremovable), the micro-SIM and microSD slots are hidden behind a panel on the left edge. Beyond the usual buttons and holes, BlackBerry's added some subtle accents here and there. The back has an industrial look to it, with the dimpled gray canvas highlighted by a square, punched-out loudspeaker grille, sunken silver BlackBerry logo and glass band covering the camera lens, announcing its specifications in futuristic font. The front-facing camera and earpiece are joined by a large, red notification LED on the face of the device that screams, "Check your phone," and another silver BlackBerry logo (this time with the name alongside it) sits below the display.. None of these are unwelcome touches, but they don't combine to make the Leap anything more than indistinctive. If the handset didn't feel so big, the grand design might blend better with the utilitarian nature of the device. But, being a little awkward to use with one hand, it doesn't seem like a more striking look was sacrificed in the pursuit of enhanced productivity.. The Leap has a 5-inch, 1,280 x 720 (720p) LCD display, which is nothing abnormal for a mid-range device at this price point. (In fact, I would be surprised if the numbers were any different). I'm not a great believer in huge pixel counts making a massive difference to user experience on small screens, but I appreciate a good quality panel. Alas, the Leap's display left me wanting. Colors are vibrant enough and the white balance setting spot on, although you can adjust this in the settings if you feel otherwise. Blacks are of the depth typical to LCD displays, which is to say good, but not as vacuous as you see with AMOLED technology. When I'm on a particularly dark screen, I can pick out areas along the perimeter where light is bleeding onto the display. My review unit's screen is particularly ill-fitting in the top left-hand corner, although the uneven lighting is barely noticeable with brighter colors.. Viewing angles are passable, but sunlight readability is where it really lets itself down. The display's lacking the kind of power you need to cut through direct rays, and there appears to be no difference between 50 percent brightness and full whack when the sun's beating down on the glass. It's not completely unreadable -- you'll still be able to follow a map, read a tweet or just about frame that picture through the glare -- but it's just not enjoyable having to squint and spin around in search of the shade of your own shadow.. Build 10.3.1 of the OS, to be exact, like the BlackBerry Classic. Even if you've had no prior experience with BB10, you should find it vaguely familiar all the same, although it relies more heavily on gestures than other mobile operating systems. You'll see a plain home screen when you unlock the device; a swipe to the left will bring up your app grid. Gesturing becomes important when you're actually running an app, and swiping up from the bottom bezel will effectively minimize what you're looking at and pin it to the home screen, which doubles as your task manager. It means you can quickly get at your most used apps and see what's running in the background. And kinda like Windows Phone's Live Tiles, some display snippets of live information -- your last WhatsApp IM, for example. Swiping right in some apps brings up contextual menus, and swiping down from the top bezel anywhere within the OS will give you access to a quick-settings dropdown. In short, it'll be relatively intuitive to anyone who's handled a smartphone before, and you quickly get used to the emphasis on gestures.. From the home screen, swiping right sends you to the BlackBerry Hub, one of the key features of BB10. It's probably best described as an email client/persistent notification bar (or maybe not). By far my favorite thing about the OS, it puts all of your messages and notifications in one place, from texts, emails, tweets and IMs to Facebook pokes, your call history, calendar appointments and low-battery reminders. You can filter, prioritize and view notifications from individual services and accounts, of course, but it's nice to have everything within thumb's reach. I can dismiss a missed call, mark a WhatsApp message as read, delete an SMS, archive an email and jump straight into Facebook to check the photo I've been tagged in right from the Hub. Being a Gmail user almost exclusively, I wish I could tag and archive emails easier, without having to go through a bunch of menus, but even I find the BlackBerry Hub extremely... I guess you could consider the BlackBerry Assistant another main feature of BB10, especially since it has its own dedicated physical button in between the volume keys. It's basically BlackBerry's version of Siri, Cortana or Google Now. You can instruct the voice-controlled virtual assistant to change settings, launch apps, message a friend, find you a dinner spot, perform contextual searches of content on the device or the web and so on. I can't say there's anything extra-special about this particular manifestation of a virtual aide, although it did easily answer my question of "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?" What it does, it does well, even if you have to wait a couple of seconds for it to process requests. As with its peers on other platforms, though, I just don't find myself using BlackBerry Assistant. I'd rather tap at my phone than talk to it. And let's be honest: So would you.. A feature introduced in BB 10.3 that definitely deserves an extended mention is BlackBerry Blend. Install the Blend client on your PC or Android/iOS tablet, pair it with a BlackBerry and you can access that phone from anywhere. Within Blend, you'll find your contact list and calendar appointments, as well as a lighter version of the BlackBerry Hub comprising emails, text messages and BBMs. In addition to being able to view this information, you can also add calendar appointments and send messages from the client without touching your phone. For enterprise users, it means you can hammer out a few work emails on your home computer without logging into a corporate VPN, or see your next meeting and text your co-worker to tell them you'll be late if you've left your phone on the kitchen table.. It's not seamless or elegant in the way Apple's Continuity feature works between iOS and OS X, and you can't dial out or even see your call history within Blend. But, it's a simple, unashamedly functional app. I can't claim to have used it extensively, but being able to access all data on the phone from the comfort of my laptop made transferring my camera sample photos a breeze. So, even if you're not a business type, there are still tasks that Blend can simplify for you.. Since the Leap is one of a handful of BlackBerrys without a physical keyboard, it's worth noting that the typing experience is still fantastic, and as good as you'll find on any touchscreen smartphone. BlackBerry uses a type of predictive-text engine that suggests a couple of words you might be working toward above what would be the next letter in that word. You can lock in predictions by swiping upward on the letter below, but I found paying attention to these only slowed me down. Regardless, I can still crank out prose at a rapid pace by letting the prediction engine do its thing without my input, and for me, it's almost as good as SwiftKey, which is the first thing I install on every Android phone I get my hands on.. There's a lot to like about BB10 and yet, it still feels like it's lagging behind the major platforms. And that's not strictly about app availability either. The Maps application, for example, just isn't as pretty or as slick as Google's offering. Similarly, the stock browser lacks polish, and other core experiences aren't as user-friendly as their competitors. Setting an alarm takes far too many taps, and various menus are unnecessarily complex. The app selection, too, is a problem for me, and I must confess to carrying around a secondary Android handset while using the Leap as my daily driver. You have access to apps from BlackBerry World, which is pitched as the place to go for productivity tools, and Amazon's Android Appstore, which contains a bit of everything. Still, the range of apps available through both of these combined is nothing compared to Google Play or Apple's equivalent.. The preinstalled YouTube app, for instance, is a link to the mobile site, and there's no official Instagram client in either app store, let alone all the obscure Android apps I use regularly. You can sideload Android apps if you have the inclination and the know-how, but that's no real solution to app scarcity -- plus you have to manually update any sideloaded apps when new versions are released. It's the same criticism of BB10 (and Windows Phone, for that matter) you hear time and time again. Now, if you're supplied a Leap as a work phone, you're probably not going to care all that much about filling it with apps. But, if you're looking at one for yourself, a weak app selection might be cause for concern.. Like the Z10 and Z30, the Leap sports a modest 8-megapixel camera, with a 2-megapixel front-facing shooter for all your selfie and video-calling needs. Considering the Leap is really an enterprise device that's geared toward productivity, not taking pretty pictures, its primary camera is surprisingly versatile. The stock camera interface is nice and light, just how I like it, with only a handful of settings. From the viewfinder menu, you can change flash behavior; aspect ratio; turn HDR on/off; set a timer; and select among normal, panorama, burst-capture and time-shift shooting modes (the latter is basically burst capture, but you pick your favorite image to keep). There's no messing around with ISO values, exposure compensation and white balance settings: All of this is handled automatically. One thing that's missing and shouldn't be, however, is the option to turn off the irritating shutter sound.. Gallery: BlackBerry Leap camera samples | 23 Photos. Performance and battery life The competition Wrap-up. The stock camera app has one particularly neat feature I paid close attention to. It suggests certain settings and modes based on what it sees through the lens, like recommending HDR mode if it detects contrasting lighting, or burst capture if it spots a face in the shot. I accept these suggestions more often that I reject them, finding that I tend to get the best results if I follow the camera app's advice.. Like all cameras, the Leap's main shooter does its best work in favorable lighting conditions. Robust auto-exposure compensation makes for well-saturated snaps, and even when artificial light is at play, the phone is a good judge of white balance. Shutter lag is almost nonexistent, and I'm particularly fond of the HDR mode, which adds a bunch of extra depth to photos when used appropriately. It's no use when the light starts fading, however, as the gap between the three shots it takes to build the HDR image lengthens and you end up with a blurry picture that looks like an impressionist painting. In the twilight hours, the camera struggles to pick the appropriate settings. Pictures are either under- or overexposed more often than not, but it settles down when nighttime truly rolls around and it can show off its admirable low-light performance. It certainly doesn't give up when light is at a premium, nor does it crank up exposure to the degree that images appear flat and overly noisy.. It's not all gravy, however, as focusing can be a bit problematic. Half the time, the camera locks in almost instantly on whatever you're pointing it at, but other times it's prone to inexplicably darting around, searching for the correct depth. It's not the best camera for shooting in the macro range, either. The closer an object is to the lens, the less likely you are to be able to get it in focus. Strangely, continuous autofocus when recording 1080p video works dreamily. It hardly ever fidgets, instead transitioning smoothly from one focal point to another. Video quality in general (and accompanying audio) is pretty outstanding. A high frame rate is maintained regardless of how much you're moving around, and like continuous autofocus, the exposure and white balance settings are similarly stable. Clip quality drops substantially in low light, becoming horribly noisy, but that's understandable when stills are much easier to process.. The Leap's 8-megapixel camera is no substitute for a proper DSLR, of course, but it's more than capable of taking great-looking shots when the opportunity strikes. In fact, it's among the best smartphone cameras of this caliber I've ever used, so kudos to BlackBerry for that.. Inside, the Leap shares exactly the same internals as the two-year-old Z10: a 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 Plus chip, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage (the Leap takes microSD cards of up to 128GB, too). The Z30 is practically the same, albeit with a slightly faster 1.7GHz dual-core S4 Pro processor. Just because the Leap is the newest member of the family doesn't mean it needs to have the best raw specs, but that S4 Plus chip is a red flag. It's ancient, at least in silicon years. Even so, it hums along nicely in the Leap, and I can't really complain about everyday performance. That said, I can't shake the feeling consumers are being short-changed somewhat by the presence of this last-gen processor.. Whether you're minimizing an app to the home screen, swiping across to get to the Hub or dragging the quick-settings menu into existence, there are always elements that are appearing while others are disappearing. If you move slowly through the app drawer, for instance, you'll see a subtle transparency effect applied while one grid is in the process of usurping the other. There's a lot going on, and nothing immediately opens or closes; it transitions. The point I'm trying to make is: I'd assume the phone has a lot to process while all this is happening, but even with several apps running in the background, the Leap doesn't miss a beat.. You can fly around the device pretty much as fast as your fingers can take you, only having to pause for a second while your chosen app or message loads. Browser performance is as slick as you need it to be, too. Pages load rapidly and you'll only stumble across the odd desktop site where tiling is visible. So, the chipset might be antiquated, but it doesn't have a significant impact on user experience. Occasionally, the phone does exhibit the odd glitch. An app will hang for a split second longer than usual, or there'll be a slight pause in between tapping a text-entry box and the keyboard appearing. Other times, the phone simply ignores a tap or a gesture, but I'm not sure whether this has to do with performance hiccups or quirks in the OS.. Gaming performance doesn't leave much to be desired, either. Not having access to my favorite Google Play titles, and not seeing much in the BlackBerry World store, I've sought out graphically intensive games available on Amazon's Appstore. Ravensword: Shadowlands might not be the prettiest 3D RPG, but it's detailed enough to give processors problems. Not the S4 Plus, though, which handled it without incident if you discount the minute-long loading times. A few levels of Trials Frontier put it under a little more strain, but it only dropped a couple of frames here and there (although you wouldn't see that happen nearly as much with, say, a newer quad-core Snapdragon 400 chip). I reached the processor's limit with GT Racing 2 , which froze up whenever there were more than two cars on-screen, rendering it unplayable.. I had to go out of my way to catch the Leap out, and the likelihood that anyone buying this phone will care about 3D gaming performance is slim to none. But, money is changing hands, and for what's effectively two-year-old guts stuffed into a new body. It's far from brimming in the connectivity department, too. The Leap's packing single-band (2.4GHz) WiFi 802.11b/g/n (with WiFi Display and Miracast support), Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS, which finds satellites frighteningly fast, by the way. A dual-band WiFi chip would've been appreciated, as well as some of the more mod cons like 802.11ac support and NFC. There are two BlackBerry Leap SKUs, one with an LTE radio that plays nice with all major North American carriers apart from Sprint, and another that's better suited to 4G frequencies in Europe and Asia.. It's rare for me to use a smartphone and be impressed with its battery life, but the Leap and its 2,800mAh reserve just keep on truckin'. Starting with a full tank, the Leap managed to loop a 720p video at 50 percent screen brightness for 11 hours and 5 minutes before calling it a night. Its battery saving mode kicked in automatically at 20 percent remaining, dimming the display and limiting processing power to give it that extra bit of longevity. Regardless, it's still one of the best results we've seen of late, alongside the LG G4 , and it makes the difference in real-world usage.. Not since reviewing the excellent Sony Xperia Z3 Compact have I managed to get two full days out of a phone without needing to recharge. Granted, I probably don't spend quite as much time glued to the Leap's little screen as I do a typical Android phone, purely because I haven't been using as many apps; but, 95 percent of the time I spend on all phones is checking notifications and responding to messages. For that, the Leap is fantastic, and even under heavy usage conditions, you'll easily get through a long, busy day before it thinks about giving up the ghost.. The Leap is available from BlackBerry's online store and Amazon in the US and UK for the off-contract price of $275 and £200, respectively. Oh, and UK carrier Vodafone is offering the handset for free on contracts starting at £22 per month; no US networks have chosen to carry the device yet. In terms of competition, I can't help but look immediately at the Z10 and the Z30, since they are more or less identical to the Leap on paper. In the US, the Z10 is roughly $100 cheaper than the Leap at this stage in its lifecycle, and the Z30 will save you around $45. So, is it worth paying more for the Leap just because it's new, even if it's no better? The Z30 is arguably the more sensible choice, as it has the best processor of the bunch and long battery life, like the Leap. It's a little bit of a different situation in the UK, where the Z30 is actually £40 more expensive than the Leap, although the Z10 is significantly cheaper there too.. Perhaps there's something I'm just not getting, because with the Z30 around, I don't see much of a reason for the Leap to exist. BlackBerry is aiming the Leap at young, up-and-coming professionals wanting a device that makes them look busier than they really are. But, while the company is keen to flog as many as possible to you and me, we're not the true target market. Companies that run email exchanges through BlackBerry Enterprise Server and enter into 10,000-unit distribution deals are. The Leap is made by business for business: a serious-looking, reasonably priced device with tempting discounts on bulk orders. It's optional hardware offered to companies as part of the full BlackBerry package, in a form factor their employees are accustomed to. What's inside the device is of little importance, really, because there's no incentive to evolve the hardware as long as it keeps the email flowing.. Nonetheless, I can't help but feel that your everyday consumers, BlackBerry fanatics included, are getting the short end of the stick. A price of $275 isn't a nominal sum, especially when you're paying that for two-year-old hardware. Performance barely suffers, I admit, but that doesn't change the fact you can get better bang for your buck elsewhere. Take the Moto G , for example, which is widely considered a leading device where value for money is concerned. In the US, the 3G version of the second-gen Moto G is $180, while the 4G variant is £149 in the UK. Even though the LTE model isn't available in the states yet, I'd still argue this cheaper device would serve you better than the Leap. For one, it's packing an up-to-date processor and solid specs all-round, and being an Android device, all the apps you could ever want are just a few taps away.. Look hard enough and you'll find myriad Android devices with comparable specs (or better) in the same price range (or cheaper) than the Leap. BB10 has a number of good features, and I wish other platforms thought about creating a BlackBerry-style Hub of their own. But, with several misgivings and a lean app selection, I can't justify recommending the Leap over less-expensive, better-equipped Android handsets.. Viewed in isolation, the BlackBerry Leap isn't a terrible device; there's just nothing particularly exciting about it. The design is unimaginative, largely borrowed from the lesser-known BlackBerry Z3, and its size can make it cumbersome to use at times. And, for every positive note, there's always a "but." You wouldn't expect any better or worse than a 720p display on this tier of device, but the quality of the Leap's panel is poor. BB10 OS has some great features, especially the Hub, but a weak app catalog makes it hard to recommend over other platforms. Device performance is admirable, but that doesn't excuse the use of outdated hardware at this price point. The Leap's 8-megapixel main camera is surprisingly good considering the spec, and you gotta love that battery life, but are these enough to warrant a purchase? Perhaps I'm belaboring the point.. If you're a BlackBerry diehard, then you might be willing to forgive the Leap's shortcomings if you're ready to update (I use the term loosely), and it's not extortionately priced at $275/£200. In my opinion, though, you would be compromising where you needn't be. Pick out an affordable Android phone, or simply go for a cheaper BlackBerry if you must. I've been quite happy using the device for the purpose of this review. Like I said from the get-go, if your company gives you one for work purposes, most of my criticisms will be moot. Where productivity is paramount, the Leap shines. If you want a smartphone for your own personal needs, however, then there are better phones and better platforms for the job.. bb10 , bb10.3 , blackberry , blackberry10 , blackberryleap , leap , mobilepostcross , review , smartphone , uk-reviews.

Take a look at the BlackBerry Leap. Although it feels like only last week I was writing a post announcing the device, in reality it wasn't. It was well over a month ago now at Mobile World Congress but, thanks to a quick turnaround time from announcement to delivery, here we are taking a look at the latest all-touch BlackBerry 10 smartphone introduced to the world as the BlackBerry Leap , which starts rolling out globally today .. While the past two devices, the BlackBerry Passport and the BlackBerry Classic , were meant for QWERTY keyboard fans, the BlackBerry Leap takes aim at those who want 'an affordable all-touch smartphone in a modern and powerful design'. As BlackBerry puts it, the 'BlackBerry Leap was built specifically for mobile professionals who see their smartphone device as a powerful and durable productivity tool that also safeguards sensitive communications at all times.'. I get the sales pitch for the BlackBerry Leap and it fits right in to BlackBerry's current focus, but really I think the BlackBerry Leap is aimed at anyone who wants a new all-touch BlackBerry 10 smartphone period. The last all-touch device to be released by BlackBerry was the regionally limited BlackBerry Z3 in May of 2014. Prior to that we had the BlackBerry Z30 , which was released way back in October of 2013. It's still going strong today thanks to recent price drops and sales wherein you can pick one up for $250. No other new all-touch devices have been released, unless you include the Z10 inspired P'9982 , which was released November 21st, 2013 , but I don't consider that a mass audience device.. In the smartphone world, that's a long time for all-touch fans to be waiting. I have no doubt that some likely picked up a Passport or a Classic just to try something new or even replace a BlackBerry Z10 that maybe died a bit too early while waiting for a new all-touch device to arrive. All this is to say, if you look at everything on the whole, the BlackBerry Leap is arriving at a perfect time. Whether or not that will translate into sales of the device for BlackBerry remains to be seen but the potential is certainly there.. As with all device reviews, there's no better way to get things started than with an unboxing. For the BlackBerry Leap, there was no fancy press box. What BlackBerry did send along is quite clearly the retail packaging for the device and that came packed with the basic items needed to get up and running with the BlackBerry Leap. Inside the package was, of course, a BlackBerry Leap smartphone, USB charging block, sync/charge cable, as well as a set of BlackBerry's standard headphones. Hit play on the video to give it a look. The video comes in at around 10 minutes and gives some brief comparisons to the Z3 , Z10 as well as the Z30 .. Much like the BlackBerry Classic, BlackBerry stuck with familiar territory for the specs on the BlackBerry Leap. Much like the BlackBerry Classic, BlackBerry stuck with familiar territory for the specs on the BlackBerry Leap. The BlackBerry Leap is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 1.5 GHz dual-core processor (Adreno 225) and 2GB of RAM with 16GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB).. For the display, you get a 5-inch 1280x720 LCD coming in at 294 PPI and for cameras you get an 8MP auto-focus rear facing camera with 5x digital zoom while around the front you have a 2MP fixed-focus with 3x digital zoom for BBM Meetings and of course, some selfies if that's the type of thing you enjoy. For video shooting, the rear camera can capture up to 1080p while the front can capture up to 720p.. Now, when it comes to the additional features on the device, that's where BlackBerry did a little bit of trimming. The BlackBerry Leap includes Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy and EDR, plus it supports video out via Wi-Fi Direct and Miracast and of course, assisted, autonomous, and simultaneous GPS are on board as well as support for User Plane and Control Plane GPS. Aside from the LTE support, you also get 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi in the 2.4GHz flavor, as well as support for Mobile Hotspot.. What's missing though? Well, NFC is not to be found on the BlackBerry Leap. Neither is a SlimPort, which allowed for charging and HDMI out and has been present in the last two BlackBerry 10 smartphones released. You'll also find no support here for USB On-The-Go. Are any of those deal breakers? I don't think so personally, but if you became accustomed to using any of them, moving to a device without them is a bit harder.. Those things were almost certainly removed to cut costs on hardware and BlackBerry likely did some surveys to find out how many people were actually using those features, but they were great, albeit small, selling points. I feel like someone gave me some candy and then snatched it back.. It shares a lot of what made the Z3 a Z3, but there is some subtle and not so subtle differences in the design for sure.. Ahead of getting my BlackBerry Leap review unit, I had only seen the device once in person and the device I saw at that time was pre-production. Other than that, I've only seen pictures of it and because of that I had some preconceived ideas about the device. I'm sure I've relayed them here on the blogs but as a reminder, it looked to me identical to the BlackBerry Z3. Now, having the Leap sitting here in front of me I can say that's not entirely accurate but it's not entirely inaccurate either.. It shares a lot of what made the Z3 a Z3, but there are some subtle and not so subtle differences in the design for sure. For one, the Leap is taller than the Z3. Plus, the Leap weighs more thanks to the 2800 mAH battery. The Leap weighs in at 170g while the Z3 weighs in at 164g. On top of all that, the Leap is more rounded off; it's not as square as the Z3 as shown a bit in the unboxing video.. Another spot where the Leap is better than the Z3 is the display. Right out front you have a bright 5-inch, 1280x720 LCD display that, even when set to mid-levels for battery saving reasons, still manages to look great and have some nice color pops to it.. On the right-hand side of the BlackBerry Leap, you have your volume up and volume down rockers, as well as your mute key in the middle. On the left-hand side is where you'll find your microSIM slot as well as your microSD slot side-by-side each other. It's a combined unit, so unlike the BlackBerry Classic where you'd have to take out the nanoSIM tray and microSD tray, all you have to do is release the 'flap' and you have access to both. Speaking of that flap, it's pretty tough and fits in place pretty snugly so I don't have any worries of it falling off at any given point like some you see that kind of dangle off the device. At the top of the BlackBerry Leap is where you'll find your lock / standby / power button right in the middle while to the left is where you'll spot the 3.5mm headphone jack. Skip to the bottom of the BlackBerry Leap, and that is where you'll find your microUSB charging port as well as a microphone hole and nothing else. You'd almost expect there to be speaker ports there based on previous BlackBerry 10 devices, but that's not the case at all.. On the Leap, the speaker is actually on the back of the device at the bottom and while sound on the Leap isn't terrible by any means, it's certainly light. You have to be mindful of where you sit your device if you expect to hear anything. Setting it on a table or flat surface is perfectly fine but toss it on something soft like a bed and it's going to get a little muffled. Might not be so good if you fall asleep with your phone expecting your alarm to wake you up only to find out it was buried so far under your pillow you couldn't hear it. Speaking from experience, by the way.. Finally, the battery door features BlackBerry's signature dot textured soft-touch finish, which allows you to handle the device with ease and provides grip to ensure you're not dropping your device all over the place. This is obviously carried over from several other BlackBerry smartphones but it looks really sharp on the BlackBerry Leap.. The Leap display is on par with the price point of the device as I see it. On a comparison level, I think anyone who is thinking of moving into a Leap from say a BlackBerry Z10, BlackBerry Z3 or even a BlackBerry Z30 would be happy with the Leap display. As I noted above, even when set to mid-levels for battery saving reasons, the display on the Leap still manages to look great. Turn it all the way up and it looks even better. Don't get me wrong here, the BlackBerry Passport and its gorgeous 1440x1440 453 PPI still takes the cake out of all the BlackBerry 10 smartphones, but the Leap display is on par with the price point of the device as I see it.. Plus, as most folks should now be aware, BlackBerry 10.3.1 allows you to tweak up the display settings and white balance on the BlackBerry Leap a bit. If you want your device to have a 'cooler' white or 'warmer' white, it's as easy as jumping into the settings and making the adjustments.. The BlackBerry Leap sticks to that best-in-class keyboard experience. There's not really a ton to say about the virtual keyboard here. The virtual keyboard on BlackBerry 10 is still one of the best on mobile and the BlackBerry Leap sticks to that best-in-class keyboard experience.. As with all BlackBerry 10 phones, the keyboard learns how you write and because of that, it offers some of the best error correction available on mobile devices plus, multi-language support is built right in allowing for you to type multiple languages simultaneously.. Not a feature I use, but I certainly know there are plenty of people out there who really do use it on a daily basis and would be lost without it.. The BlackBerry Classic lasted me throughout the day but was ready for the charger by the end of the night. Although times have changed a bit, and user-replaceable batteries seem not as high on the must have list, having a battery that can get you through the day is still an expectation, and BlackBerry remains aware of that. For the Leap, BlackBerry loaded up the device with a 2800 mAh non-removable battery and while it certainly adds some weight, BlackBerry claims it will get you up to 25 hours with mixed use, enough to power through a full day.. On a personal level, since I'm a BlackBerry Passport user, it's not often I pay attention to battery life. There's never a day where I'm worrying about battery life on my Passport, and so I was rather curious if the Leap could deliver on that full day. I have a pretty basic thought process for battery life and it boils down to 'If I go to bed with my phone close to being dead, can I wake up in the morning and have it still be alive and have enough time to charge it a bit and get me out the door?' If so, that's what I consider good battery life these days and thankfully, the BlackBerry Leap was able to do that.. That being said, we all use our devices differently and all have different levels of what we consider 'good battery life' and as always your mileage is going to vary. Personally, I don't think anyone is going to have any issues with battery life on the Leap if your criteria for good battery life is similar to mine.. Plus, where the Leap comes with BlackBerry OS 10.3.1, also includes the battery saving mode that when activated starts to limit or disable some functions of your device such as screen brightness, location services, data services, advanced interactions, and it can even lower the CPU performance. If you weren't already aware, it comes enabled by default and it kicks in when you reach 20% battery life remaining, but that's customizable so you can set it to turn on whenever you wish, or you can disable it entirely. It's up to you if you wish to run it.. Scene Modes - Auto, Action, Whiteboard, Night, Beach or Snow. Aspect Ratio Options - 1:1, 4:3, 16:9. Camera Modes - Time shift for getting a shot with everyone smiling with their eyes open, Burst, Panorama, High Dynamic Range. Camera Settings - Face detection, Auto suggest capture settings, Save on Media Card, Display Grid Lines, Save Original, Continuous Video Focus, Geotag Pictures. For cameras, BlackBerry has included an 8MP camera on the rear capable of shooting 720p, 1080p or even 720p at 60fps while the front is home to a 2MP camera capable of capturing video up to 720p. That's all the basic info but the BlackBerry 10.3.1 software adds more to it through various optimizations such as the ability to take photos while capturing video, shooting modes, and even a nice set of tools for post processing both images and video that includes filters, frames, the ability to add slow-mo or trim the content, and reduce red-eye as well as adjusting audio levels, color levels and more.. On top of those built in goodies, you also get Story Maker which allows you to take all your photos and video content and mix it together with a custom audio track to create some really awesome videos that are able to be shared with friends and family.. If you've used any BlackBerry 10 smartphone previously, you're already familiar with all these features so I'm not going to elaborate on every single one of them again. Overall, it's nice built in package that BlackBerry keeps adding to.. I have a love-hate relationship with cameras on BlackBerry 10 smartphones. All the software stuff is awesome but how do the cameras perform? Well, here's the thing. I have a love-hate relationship with cameras on BlackBerry 10 smartphones but really, it's not the phones themselves nor the hardware that gives me grief. You see, one thing I've noticed is that different OS' handle the camera differently and while some builds are really GREAT for the cameras, others tend to be really BAD for the cameras. In the case of the Leap, as tested, the device comes with OS 10.3.1.2726 (SW Version: 10.3.1.1877) out of the box and luckily, this OS treats the cameras just fine.. I think it's fair to say at this point BlackBerry, for the most part, is using the same camera hardware across the board with the exception of the BlackBerry Passport and its 13MP offering and with that in mind, it's also fair to say that the pictures that come off BlackBerry 10 smartphones are just 'fine'. Under ideal conditions, you really can take some amazing shots that look as though they were taken with a far better camera but if those conditions aren't ideal it's all a bit of a crap shoot as to how well your images will turn out.. Again, I look to my BlackBerry Passport review where I said that BlackBerry went a step further and decided to put some better hardware behind the camera as opposed to other BlackBerry 10 devices where the cameras are just 'good enough'. They're not TERRIBLE but they're not GREAT either. They are good enough for most things and at this point, I'm perfectly fine with that being the case. It's up to you to decide if you're fine with that as well.. Although the majority of my days are spent in front of a computer on Skype and Google Hangouts and BBM Meetings, some people spend their whole day on their smartphone and having a phone that performs well and sounds good remains a high priority. And as has been said many times, BlackBerry has never really had any huge issues in that arena so it's no surprise the Leap is great for calls.. This is another area where the BlackBerry Passport still leads the BlackBerry 10 pack with its unique feature called Active Leak Compensation, which automatically adjusts the call volume based on how close you hold the smartphone to your ear. Even though the Leap lacks that feature I had no issues with calls.. I called several different people while being in several different environments and all came out fine, even on speakerphone. The only issue with speakerphone that I would note is something I mentioned earlier in regards to the speaker placement on the Leap. Make sure it's on a flat hard surface or you might end up blocking out the speaker on the back and not hearing so well. Shouldn't be a problem for boardroom and office tables or desks though.. the BlackBerry Leap comes loaded with OS 10.3.1.2726. As I noted in the camera section quickly, the BlackBerry Leap comes loaded with OS 10.3.1.2726 (SW Version: 10.3.1.1877) which is essentially the highest officially available OS right now. When it comes to BlackBerry OS 10.3.1 in general, I don't think I need to break down every detail.. We should all be familiar with the changes that OS brings from the rollout across the numerous BlackBerry 10 devices on the market now such as the BlackBerry Z10 , BlackBerry Q5 , BlackBerry Q10 , BlackBerry Z30 , BlackBerry Z3 and finally, the BlackBerry Passport and Classic so instead, I'll give you all the quick breakdown of what's new with BlackBerry OS 10.3.1.. BlackBerry Blend - With BlackBerry Blend, users can access email messages, files, and certain apps on a computer or tablet the same way. they'd use them on a BlackBerry device. BlackBerry Blend supports devices running BlackBerry 10 OS version 10.3.x. BlackBerry Assistant - The BlackBerry Assistant app makes it even easier for you to multi-task using your BlackBerry device! With the BlackBerry Assistant app, you can perform a variety of everyday tasks by talking or typing in natural language. When you say or type a request, the BlackBerry Assistant app can perform your request, search your device, or search the Internet, and provide a response. Using the BlackBerry Assistant app you can start a BBM chat, make a phone call, send an email message, or add an event to your calendar. You can also update your status in social networking apps, and search for directions, weather forecasts, information about restaurants or shopping, and more..

Modernized visual elements help you navigate your BlackBerry device and improve your productivity within apps. On the home screen you can see your open apps, and when you swipe left you can see all your apps. By default, when no apps are open, the home screen displays only your wallpaper. Also, there is no restriction on the number of apps you can add to folders on the home screen.. Action bar - The action bar at the bottom of the screen in applications installed with BlackBerry 10 OS version 10.3.x has been updated to improve productivity while using apps. The action bar uses color to highlight the next, or next best action. The highlighted icon is called the Signature Action. The Back button and icons for key tasks persist in the action bar to help the user stay productive and keep on task. In some apps, for example the Adobe Reader app, the action bar disappears when you scroll, giving you a full screen view of the content.. Home screen - The home screen displays the running apps and the apps installed on the user's BlackBerry device. The home screen has been updated to improve the user's experience when using BlackBerry 10. There is no restriction on the number of apps the user can add to folders on the home screen. Merge the contents of two folders by dragging a folder on top of another folder. Running apps stay in a fixed position based on the order the user opens the apps.

Email - From the BlackBerry Hub, the user can now: File a sent email message in a folder that is created by the user in the email client on a computer, Set the sync interval for IMAP email accounts, to control how frequently email messages are synchronized with the user's BlackBerry device, Automatically save a draft email by leaving the BlackBerry Hub, Download and save all the attachments in an email at the same time, Delete the original email text when replying to an email. Recent Contacts - The Recent Contacts feature in the BlackBerry Hub has been updated to improve the relevance of suggested contacts. When the user composes an email, the BlackBerry Hub only suggests contacts that: Are associated with the email account that the user is sending the email message from or the user has communicated within the last 60 days.. Meeting mode - Meeting mode automatically changes the notification behavior of the BlackBerry device when the device detects that the user is in a meeting or at an event. For example, the user can set meeting mode to automatically turn off all sounds and ring tones when a meeting is scheduled in the user's calendar. The user receives a notification letting the user know that the device is in meeting mode.. BlackBerry Remember integration - The Calendar app is more closely integrated with BlackBerry Remember. The user can create a task in the Calendar app, and view the task in the Calendar app and the BlackBerry Remember app. The tasks and notes are separated by a tab and as a user you'll have the ability to set what your default view is.. Join Now improvements - The Join Now feature for calendar events has been improved to support international dial-in phone numbers and additional languages.. Camera - Taking pictures and recording videos using the Camera app is easy with BlackBerry 10 OS version 10.3.x The Camera app lets a user snap a picture, record a video, and switch between the front and back cameras from the main screen. Users can even take a picture while recording a video! Automatic suggestions allow the user to focus less on the Camera app and more on capturing the moment! By default, each time the user opens the Camera app, the camera is set up to use the Normal shooting mode and Auto scene mode. With BlackBerry 10 OS version 10.3.x, the Camera app detects the conditions of the scene the user wants to take a picture or video of, and suggests the settings to use. Suggestions are interactive and appear at the top of the screen. To turn on the suggested setting, the user taps the suggestion. The redesigned, consolidated menu in the Camera app lets a user quickly: Switch between the front and back cameras. Change the scene mode, aspect ratio, flash settings, and other camera settings. Change the shooting mode to Normal, Time Shift, Burst, or Panorama. Set a timer to count down before the camera takes a picture. A timer can be set even if the user is using Time Shift mode. Additionally, Offline Time Shift picture editing allows you to edit Time Shift pictures after they've been taken.. BlackBerry Story Maker - The BlackBerry Story Maker app takes the work out of making picture and video collections by grouping the pictures and videos on your BlackBerry device by date, time, or location. BlackBerry Story Maker presents stories to you in the Date view of the Pictures app. BlackBerry Story Maker can also suggest stories based on pictures and videos that are favorites, most viewed, recently viewed, and recently added. From the BlackBerry Story Maker app, you can easily add favorite pictures and videos to your stories. You can also personalize your stories by changing the theme and editing the pictures and music before sharing the stories with your friends, colleagues, and family.. Videos - When you open the Videos app, videos that you recently added or played appear across the top of the screen. The Favorites view lets you quickly see your favorite videos. And you can edit your videos so that the video, or part of the video, plays in slow motion. You can also adjust the quality of the sound in your videos by changing the equalizer options. The Videos app is more closely integrated with the BlackBerry Story Maker app. You can quickly send videos to BlackBerry Story Maker to create a story or add to an existing story..

For example, after you select the pictures you want to be able to hide, before you pass your BlackBerry device to a friend or coworker, with a quick swipe and tap, you can hide the pictures you don't want other people to see. After your device is returned to you, with another swipe and tap, you can quickly view the hidden pictures again.. View Your Pictures by Location: The Map feature in the Pictures app lets you see the locations where you have taken pictures. With a quick tap on the map, you can view all of your pictures from that location! You can zoom in and move around the map, just like when you use the Maps app..

Connections - The Device Monitor lets a user view the data usage of the BlackBerry device on the mobile network and Wi-Fi network. The device Monitor displays the total amount of data used by the device, which includes data usage while roaming, and the total amount of data used by apps on the device. This feature helps users track which apps use high volumes of data. When the user minimizes the Device Monitor, the minimized app displays basic usage information about the device, such as the estimated remaining battery life.. Set Battery Saving Mode Options: Improvements have been made to the BlackBerry 10 OS to help improve the life of the battery in your BlackBerry device so that your device is ready to perform when you are. Battery Saving Mode lets you set options to conserve battery power. By default, when your device is in Battery Saving Mode, the device reduces the brightness of the screen and doesn't turn on the screen when it receives notifications. You can also turn off the Run When Minimized app permission so that when you minimize an app it doesn't continue to consume battery power.. Change App Permissions: The Run When Minimized application permission setting lets an app continue performing tasks after you minimize the app on your device. The Maps app is an example of an app that uses this permission. To help extend the life of your battery, turn off the Run When Minimized permission.. Create or Edit a Notification Profile: Notification profiles control how and when your BlackBerry device lets you know that you have new messages, phone calls, and more. Notification profiles control the sound, volume, vibration, and LED color of notifications by application, contact, and messaging account.

Control How Much Content is Downloaded in Your Email Messages: To help manage your data usage, you can set the amount of content that is downloaded in your email messages when your BlackBerry device is connected to the wireless network and while roaming. This feature is particularly useful if you move frequently between a Wi-Fi network and a mobile network, or for frequent roaming. You can set this feature for each email account that is set up on your device.. Set Separate Automatic Replies for Your Internal and External Contacts: You can set an automatic reply for contacts within your organization and a separate automatic reply for contacts that are outside of your organization. You must have a Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync email account added to your BlackBerry device that supports internal and external out-of-office notifications. You can also set a date range during which time automatic replies are sent.. Sync Microsoft Exchange Contact Folders: If you add a Microsoft Exchange email account to your BlackBerry device, you can choose the Contact folders that are set up in Microsoft Exchange that you want to sync with your device.. Quickly Copy Contact Information: You can touch and hold contact information, such as an address, phone number, or email address, and quickly copy it so that you can paste it into another app.. Adobe Flash removed - This more of a heads up than anything. As BlackBerry noted previously : Adobe has stopped Flash development support for mobile browsers. This is consistent with the shift of mobile web content generally moving towards HTML5. As a result, we can no longer support Adobe Flash beginning with the software release of BlackBerry 10 OS version 10.3.1.. Realistically, there are thousands of changes that came with BlackBerry OS 10.3.1 and there's no way we can outline every single one, but the good news is, the BlackBerry Leap can take advantage of all them. Well, unless they relate to NFC, HDMI out or USB-On-The-Go but I digress.. It always feels a bit odd adding BBM to a review, but for a lot of folks it's an essential tool to have included. As we know, BBM has grown quite a bit over the past two years and the BlackBerry Leap handles it all perfectly fine. Whether you're just taking part in BBM Groups, running a BBM channel, or loading up on stickers from the BBM Shop, the BlackBerry Leap can keep up with your BBM needs.. There's also now BBM Meetings for high-quality collaboration on the go and you can take advantage of the BlackBerry 10 version of BBM Protected that provides full end-to-end message encryption, incorporating three layers of security. Plus, the BBM Shop now has subscriptions, additional purchasable BBM features such as "No Ads" and "Custom PIN".. You can view messages from your BlackBerry smartphone on your computer and tablet. You can compose messages from the computer and attach files from either device. If you are on BES10 or higher, you can also access the corporate email address book. You can view, respond to, and compose messages on your computer or tablet as if you were doing these tasks on your BlackBerry smartphone including BBM and text messages. In addition to BlackBerry Hub, BBM and text messaging, you can instantly access your calendar, contacts, media and other files on your BlackBerry smartphone. If you are on BES10 or BES12 you can securely access your company Intranet and other corporate resources through your Work Browser.. Unlike older BlackBerry 10 smartphones that had to wait until 10.3.1 released in order to access BlackBerry Blend , if you pick up a BlackBerry Leap, you'll have access to the app instantly simply because you'll already be running the latest and greatest OS. BlackBerry Blend conveniently and securely connects your BlackBerry smartphone with your computer and tablet over a common Wi-Fi connection. You can also connect to your computer over USB. For added security, no data is stored on the computer or tablet.. Having used BlackBerry Blend since the release of the BlackBerry Passport, I have to say it's one of the best apps BlackBerry has ever put together. From answering BBM messages, text messages, and emails right on my desktop or iPad, to viewing all of my upcoming appointments and reminders, BlackBerry Blend is fantastic.. That's not to say it's perfect by any means. There's still plenty of room for improvement, but even with some of the small bugs that are in the app, it's still absolutely amazing. While I hate to use the words game changer, for some it realistically will be. The best part is, it's a consumer and enterprise offering, so everyone has access to it right out of the box.. Picture Password - You can protect access to your BlackBerry 10 smartphone by setting a password. You can also quickly unlock your phone using a combination of a picture and a number (0-9) of your choice, which you place at a particular point on the image. When you try to unlock the phone, the picture will appear along with a grid of random numbers. To unlock, simply drag the grid so the number you selected overlays the particular point on the image. Application Permissions - You can set Application Permissions by app or type of function, such as Location. By default, the application permissions are set to allow applications to perform certain tasks in the background without opening the app. Device and Removable Storage Encryption - You can encrypt your data, both on the device and on removable storage using 256-bit AES. BlackBerry Protect - BlackBerry Protect is another free feature for BlackBerry 10 customers. It allows you to remotely secure and locate your smartphone in the event you misplace it. You can also remotely lock or wipe the device. BlackBerry Protect identifies your BlackBerry 10 smartphone through your BlackBerry ID. BlackBerry Protect is enabled on the smartphone under Settings. Keep in mind, certain features require the phone to be connected to a network (either the cellular network or a Wi-Fi network). BlackBerry Guardian - BlackBerry Guardian evaluates all apps and games in BlackBerry World before they're made available for downloading. BlackBerry Guardian is designed to protect you from downloading apps and games that might include malicious software or privacy concerns. The BlackBerry Guardian icon in the BlackBerry World storefront indicates that the app or game has been evaluated for malicious software or privacy concerns. BlackBerry Balance - For anyone using BES10 or higher BlackBerry Balance allows your personal information to be separated from your work data. Corporate data remains within a work perimeter that can be managed by administrators, while personal data like apps downloaded from BlackBerry World, personal email accounts and photos, are yours to enjoy. Beyond accessing the Personal and Work spaces of the device, the experience is further integrated. The Hub of BlackBerry 10, as well as the Calendar app, can contain both personal and work information, allowing you to freely interact with both. BlackBerry Balance automatically locks the work accounts after a set period of time, providing protection for work information without interrupting the personal experience. BlackBerry has always pushed their security pedigree but you may have noticed with the BlackBerry Leap they're pushing it just a little bit more to the forefront and with good reason. While I'm sure BlackBerry would love for everyone to sign up for BES12 and all its additional offerings, they also want everyone to know that even without all those things, BlackBerry 10 has many built-in features that are designed to help protect your information, manage your online privacy, encrypt personal data and files on your device, and remotely locate or lock your smartphone in the event you misplace it.. All of these features are available to the BlackBerry Leap (and all BlackBerry 10 smartphones) right out of the box and are standard. Just as a sidenote, I'd like to add that I've been running BES12 Cloud since it was announced and adding my BlackBerry Leap to my account alongside all my various other BlackBerry 10 smartphones was simply a breeze. If you're genuinely concerned about your data and privacy but don't have the resources for a full BES12 install, take a look at BES12 Cloud .. BlackBerry Z10 with 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4, Adreno 225 GPU and 2GB of RAM - Lost to the BlackBerry Leap, ever so slightly. BlackBerry Z3 with 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400, Adreno 305 GPU and 1.5GB of RAM - Difference was negligible. BlackBerry Z30 with 1.7GHz Snapdragon S4, Adreno 320 GPU and 2GB of RAM - Won over the BlackBerry Leap. Alright, so this is the part of the review where I say something bad about the BlackBerry Passport and shine a light on why the BlackBerry Leap is arguably a bit better when it comes to apps. As most folks know, the BlackBerry Passport is a little bit of an odd bird. The display on the device is kinda far from standard for smartphones and despite the fact that BlackBerry included a display changing mode, some apps simply don't play nice on the BlackBerry Passport, especially Android apps.. With that being said, the display of apps on the BlackBerry Leap isn't really a concern because, well, it's pretty standard and most apps were designed with this form factor in mind. While we're on the topic of Android apps, chances are you're wondering how well they run on the BlackBerry Leap in comparison to some of the other BlackBerry 10 devices. I know that has been a big question among those who care about specs because of the similarities in the Leap from the Z10, Z3 and Z30.. Truth be told, I did have a video set up to show it off, but I didn't like how it turned out due to time constraints, so I'm going to shoot it again at some point. However, I do know the results so I can share those. The criteria, to download Crossy Road, a notoriously slow loading game through the Android runtime and see how fast each device would load it compared to the BlackBerry Leap.. So what does that mean? Well, if you ask me not a whole lot. But if you're really picky about a few seconds here and there while loading Android apps it might mean a whole lot to you and now that the Amazon App Store is included, you may find yourself downloading more Android apps and losing a few seconds here to load times.. Overall though, the BlackBerry Leap loads up and runs Android apps just as well as any other BlackBerry 10 device with the exception of the Passport. The Passport processor and extra RAM really helped the Android runtime in that respect but as I noted earlier, the Passport has Passport only issues with Android apps.. Of course, if you're among those who refuse to have anything to do with Android apps, then none of this will have any relation to whether or not you'll be picking up a BlackBerry Leap because you're still pulling apps down from BlackBerry World and that's cool. If that is indeed the case for you, you'll be pleased to know that a lot of the BlackBerry 10 apps you know and love are already available for the BlackBerry Leap due to the shared processor and display size with the various other BlackBerry 10 smartphones already available. The Leap handles native apps awesomely, as you'd expect.. I know I've made some jokes about the BlackBerry Leap in the past but anything I've said was mostly because I wished BlackBerry had released it long ago. Truthfully, they spoiled me with the BlackBerry Passport and its specs, so anything that doesn't meet those is a little rough for me.. But I'm fully aware of that and I know I'm not the target audience for the BlackBerry Leap. It's a device that isn't meant for me specifically. It's a device that is aimed at those who want an affordable, all-touch smartphone that's tough enough to hang around and ride through some bumps but still look classy and modern while doing so. There are lots of people who fit that description in both the enterprise world and consumer world.. Affordable, quality hardware that doesn't feel cheap. Virtual keyboard second only to a QWERTY BlackBerry. Battery life will get you through your day.. No NFC, SlimPort or USB On-The-Go feels like a step backward. If you own any BlackBerry 10 smartphone that's not a Passport, might feel like you're buying your old device in a new package. The fact BlackBerry used '8MP AUTO FOCUS' as branding on the back. It's silly and I hate it.. Much like the BlackBerry Passport, the BlackBerry Leap isn't going to be a device for everyone and while the reasons for that are drastically different, that's the reality. Some people are never even going to consider picking up a BlackBerry Leap because it will simply make them feel like they're buying an almost identical device to what they already have just in a new package, while others can't wait to pick up a BlackBerry Leap for the exact same reason.. The enterprise factor here, which is a big part of why the BlackBerry Leap exists, is important to BlackBerry. They need to have a device that is new and fresh but also affordable so enterprise customers can roll it out for fairly cheap and not worry about a high replacement cost should an employee end up trashing it while hustling up a good deal for the company or partying a bit too hard over the deal they just closed.. At the end of the day, BlackBerry needed to make this device happen, even if fans are screaming from the rooftops that they want a high-end all-touch device. Despite whether or not you personally decide to pick one up, the BlackBerry Leap is a pretty solid and very capable device that comes at a reasonable price, it just so happens that BlackBerry had to make a few compromises to make it all come together..

Motorola RAZR V3 Dolce & Gabbana. DROID RAZR MAXX HD by Motorola. In the mobile world industry, BlackBerry has long been recognized for manufacturing full QWERTY smartphones. And for anyone who’s been an avid BlackBerry fan, this trademark of theirs is what makes them stand out from the rest of their competition. For 2015, BlackBerry has decided to take a risk and produce an all-touch display to attract the users who are fond of using a device they can easily use with their fingers. The BlackBerry Leap is precisely that—a unique BlackBerry model with a 5-inch display that you can use to type letters on and swipe from left to right instead of using a trackpad. Powering the device is a 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8960 processor next to 2GB of RAM and Adreno 225 GPU. The phone has a native memory of 16GB, which may be expanded by up to 128GB with the use of a microSD card. It also runs on the latest BlackBerry 10 software, which means it is up to date with the best apps and games that can be downloaded on the device. To take pictures, the BlackBerry Leap is equipped with an 8MP rear-facing camera with HD video recording capability and LED flash. A secondary front-facing camera with 2MP sensor is also available. With its 2800 mAh non-removable battery, the Leap is able to last up to 25 hours of talk time.. Looks like there are no reviews yet, be the first to write one now..

New Blackberry OS 10.3.1 And Impressive Security Offerings. Blackberry continues to try to move away from its rocky past while remaining firmly rooted in tradition through its latest offering, the Blackberry Leap. The Leap is designed to be a hip and affordable phone primarily geared towards a younger and more professional business audience. The Leap remains an impressive, if somewhat familiar, offering in Blackberry’s lineup.. On the surface, it appears to be largely similar to Blackberry’s previous offering, the Z10. The same innards power both phones as the Leap comes with the dual-core 1.5Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8960 processor and 2GB of RAM that Z10 owners have had for years. It manages to do the job well enough, but it’s still slightly disappointing that Blackberry didn’t bother with an upgrade. The Leap is meant to be a more budget-minded phone however, so not too much can be held against the processor. Especially when it does handle the job well enough thanks to its included Adreno 225 GPU. After all, this isn’t an intense gaming phone. Think of the Leap as more of the type of phone one would find in the pocket of a young Silicon Valley entrepreneur.. Despite what some might consider a meager processor, one has to admire just how stunning this supposedly budget phone looks. It easily manages to find that ultimate sweet spot of having just the right amount of thickness to be sturdy yet not feel like a brick phone from the late 1990s. At the same time, the phone is thin enough to fit comfortably in the palm of your hand without feeling as if it might shatter from the slightest touch. The Leap’s dimensions are 144 x 72.8 x 9.5 mm or 5.67 x 2.87 x 0.47 inches. Its exterior body has a nice, lightly dimpled texture that’s easy to grip and manages to feel comfortable when held for an extended period of time. The texture also manages to give the Blackberry Leap a bit of extra character to make it stand out amongst the crowded phone marketplace.. The Blackberry Leap also comes with an ample 16GB of internal storage along with a rather nice edge-to-edge 5-inch 720p display. The colors are crisp and clear, and the touchscreen manages to be perfectly responsive with smooth menu transitions throughout. Two cameras are on board the Leap, with an 8-megapixel camera for the rear and a 2-megapixel camera facing the front to let the younger crowd take as many Facebook and Instagram selfies as they can manage. Full 1080p HD video recording is also possible through the rear camera. Additional features include Bluetooth 4.0 capabilities, on-board 802.11n dual-band Wi-Fi and a MicroSD card reader that can read up to 128 GB. The on-screen keyboard is also a breeze to use thanks to its accurate feel and response time. The keyboard comes with loaded with multi-language support, error corrections and customization options that Blackberry claims adapts to each user’s particular style of writing.. One particularly impressive hardware feature on the Blackberry Leap is the non-removable 2800-mAh battery. Blackberry promises that this whopping battery can power your phone through 25 hours of continuous use, more than a full day. The extended battery life is more than welcome, especially in a market full of phones that seem to beg for a long recharge every time you check your e-mail.. In terms of software, the Leap will ship with the latest Blackberry OS 10.3.1 offerings. This means the new Blackberry Assistant and Blackberry Blend software comes preloaded with every Leap. The Blackberry Assistant is a solid enough virtual assistant that responds well to voice and text commands. Only time and use will tell if Blackberry has found the new Siri, but it’s a promising feature all the same. Blackberry Blend allows users to access phone content such as e-mail, text messages, contacts and media from any supported tablet or PC. It’s a nice cross-platform offering that’s supposed to work with Windows, Mac and Android operating systems. Also packaged with the Leap is a dual-front app store system that allows users to shop from either the Blackberry World storefront or the Amazon Appstore.. Another high note for the Leap is what Blackberry is touting as a new high standard for security. Cell phone users have had much to worry about lately in terms of security, especially with more and more cyber-attacks happening with an alarming frequency. Blackberry aims to help in this aspect by giving the new Leap support for encryption and malware protection built straight into the system. Back-up features come standard on the phone along with the ability to remotely wipe everything off the system. This feature could potentially come in handy on numerous occasions, particularly for those who are prone to store sensitive information on their phone.. The final verdict is that the Leap does what it sets out to do; it manages to be a more affordable option for those who would like a classier business phone choice. It complements the rest of the Blackberry portfolio by assuming a comfortable lower-mid-tier position below the Blackberry Classic and the Blackberry Passport. It’s not an incredibly thrilling or mind-blowing phone, but really, it isn’t supposed to be. The younger, business-orientated crowd will likely be drawn to its organizational and security features, not to mention the virtual Blackberry Assistant. The Leap also manages to have a standout style in today’s market, which is a huge plus for some people. Everything about the Blackberry Leap seems to be designed with productivity in mind and with that in mind; the Leap performs more than adequately.. As of right now, the Blackberry Leap is carrying a recommended sale price of $279 USD (around £180, CAD$348 or AU$360), though when it eventually hits the market, the phone will likely sell for much less. The Leap will launch in stores sometime in 2015, with some retailers already touting a late April release.. There doesn't appear to be any current deals for this device.

BlackBerry is well-known for making devices with physical keyboards which inspire productivity. So, exactly why it's still making all-touch devices is a little intriguing, to say the least. With the Leap, the manufacturer is trying to appeal to smartphone buyers in the mid/low end of the market. But has it succeeded? Cam reviews the Leap and gives his thoughts of this smartphone.

Camera struggles in low-light and nighttime. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. When one thinks of BlackBerry, three things come to mind: security, keyboards, and lost opportunities. The first two have been cornerstones of the brand, which is largely why the last two smartphones it launched — the Passport. — focused so much on them. The last item is an unfortunate reality for the company.. Now we have the Leap, the newest all-touch BlackBerry device, which attempts to maintain the status quo. Positioned as an affordable handset that offers mid-range performance with the security and productivity features BlackBerry is known for, the Leap is certainly not made to appeal to the masses. It’s niche, much like everything else in BlackBerry’s hardware lineup, and an unusual mix of components and features make it even more so. Who might find that mix appealing depends entirely on how much the scale tips toward business over pleasure.. Under the hood, this phone is like a BlackBerry Z10 from 2013 that warped into the present in a slightly different form. Pull up the Z10’s spec sheet and the resemblance is uncanny. The 720p display, 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB internal storage, 8-megapixel rear camera, and 2-megapixel front camera are all the same. The only real differences? The LCD stretches out to 5 inches, the battery is 2,800mAh (compared to the Z10’s 1,800mAh), the microSD card slot is expandable up to 128GB (instead of 64GB in the Z10), and there is no NFC support.. The most perplexing on that list is the processor. It’s a silicon dinosaur, with even low-end Android phones having moved on from it. It was already long in the tooth when the Z10 launched in 2013, so the choice likely has a lot to do with batch-purchasing the chip to keep costs down.. Under the hood, this phone is like a BlackBerry Z10 that warped into the present in a slightly different form.. The phone’s design sticks to basic tenets, with the 5-inch display covering the whole front panel, fused together with a textured and rubberized back that is similar to the Z10. This isn’t a premium combination, but it’s certainly not pedestrian, either. At 170g, the Leap does have some heft and thickness to it. Despite having the same screen size, the Leap is taller and wider than the Z30 , and lacks its curved edges.. The Leap doesn’t have a removable back, and it frankly doesn’t need to. The SIM and microSD slots are situated together on the left side, while the familiar volume and BlackBerry Assistant buttons are on the right. The power button is placed at the very center at the top, flanked by the headphone jack and microphone. The micro-USB is placed in the center at the bottom with a microphone to its side.. The aged internals wouldn’t seem amenable to significant software upgrades, but that doesn’t appear to be the case here since the Leap runs the latest version of BlackBerry’s OS, 10.3.1. Passport and Classic users have already been on that for months, so the Leap is in line with where the rest of the lineup currently sits.. Even so, BlackBerry 10 seems to be a strange dichotomy. It’s a very functional OS, and the Hub continues to be the best email and messaging platform I’ve seen in any mobile platform. And yet it all seems almost unfinished — like it’s missing something visual or practical to make it look more polished. The inclusion of the Amazon Appstore was meant to legitimize the addition of Android apps, which is nice, except the selection seems to change without warning.. The last time I was able to freely download Netflix from the Appstore was with the Passport. When I search for them on the Leap, they’re nowhere to be found, and I can’t understand why. Despite that archaic chipset, these apps should run fine on the Leap. There is the option to sideload APK files, of course, but that also requires manually loading the apps all over again when updated versions are released.. Unfortunately, there’s still no way to get notifications from Android apps, forcing users to go in and see whether there is something new to look at. The lack of Google Play Services support is another hole that seems unlikely to be filled anytime soon.. To be fair, the Leap’s merits shouldn’t begin and end with entertainment and gaming apps. After all, this is supposed to be a workhorse for the working man or woman. The Hub’s efficiency extends also to what I believe is the best virtual keyboard in the business. Responsive, smart and shrewdly customizable, the goodness BlackBerry users come to expect from the physical keyboard is mirrored here as well. The intuitiveness of text prediction feels more realistic than what I’ve seen from others on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.. Then there’s Blend, BlackBerry’s unique connectivity and productivity platform. designed to extend the phone onto a secure interface you can use on other devices, including Windows PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. Though more should be done to make this even better, particularly improving file transfers, the gist of what’s there is worth diving into.. I expected to feel like I was using a phone with an old soul, and for the most part, was surprised at how well it fared. The Leap’s screen doesn’t look out of its depth, and it was very responsive to touch. Apps launched without fail, and I never really encountered any crashes.. To be fair, the Leap’s merits shouldn’t begin and end with entertainment and gaming apps.. But there are usability consequences to note. Launching apps, especially Android ones, shows a noticeable lag. Multitasking from app-to-app incurs a slight delay. These are subtle cues that aren’t so much a problem, but more a case that patience is part of the deal here. As with any mid-range Android phone that has to work a bit harder, the same is true of the Leap.. The BlackBerry Assistant voice platform doesn’t get any major upgrade, but is still a competent and effective way to search or get things done. Doing a web search is as easy as setting a calendar appointment, sending a message, or making a call. Again, the processing involved does take longer on the Leap than on the Passport or Classic, largely because those two use much faster chipsets.. When it comes to consuming content, there is a YouTube “app” that is really just a shortcut to the browser version. It runs perfectly fine, mind you, but isn’t going to feel as user-friendly as the mobile apps found on other platforms. An Android version wasn’t available through the Appstore.. Games are generally okay, but the higher the rendering and graphic output, the more the Leap strains to keep up. I could play Angry Birds without incident, but Modern Combat 5 had its moments of instability along the way. But the Leap isn’t made to play the latest and greatest games. That it can play games and stream video well enough is a testament to just how much BlackBerry has been able to squeeze out of such an ancient processor.. The ability of the Leap’s 8-megapixel rear camera is commensurate with the amount of light it’s able to take in. The brighter the day or environment, the better the image or video turns out to be. There are no surprises here because using the same image sensor and lens as the Z10 makes the results all too predictable. Granted, the Leap is running 10.3.1, which has offered some software optimization to improve composition, but there isn’t too much magic going on here.. Besides, when a phone is positioned as an affordable business tool above all else, the camera is unlikely to get a serious overhaul. This isn’t to say that the Leap can’t take good photos. It’s just that the conditions in which it does have to be optimal.. Results aren’t bad, and it helps that BlackBerry has at least tried to lend some support on the fly. The camera app will suggest HDR mode if the sensor notices contrasting shadows and brightness, or Burst mode if it notices movement or detects faces. Auto-focusing isn’t bad, particularly when compared to other mid-range handsets.. When the lights dim or night falls, however, the weaknesses become apparent. With no optical image stabilization or wider aperture, low-light shooting is challenging. HDR mode can help offset some of the extremes, but it’s not enough to glean impressive results. Even the steadiest hand can’t save certain photos. Resting the phone on a flat surface, setting a timer and shooting in Night mode is probably the best setup for shooting in such a scenario, however impractical that may be.. The dated specs and larger battery combine for one of the longest lives I’ve seen on a phone at this price point. With a much larger battery than the Z10, the Leap earns its keep as a workhorse. With moderate usage that stuck to business-oriented tasks, I was able to go two days before needing to recharge. With more mixed usage that included gaming and video streaming, I could still pass 24 hours. When it reaches 20 percent left, the battery saver mode kicks in to keep the lights on longer.. That’s impressive, given the older guts under the hood. It’s also non-negotiable for business users who need to feel secure that their phone won’t thirst for more juice within hours. Mid-range smartphones rarely do well in that department, so this is easily one of the Leap’s highlights.. Were this an Android phone, it could be written off as an affordable handset that any budget-conscious user could make do with to stay connected. That doesn’t fly here, simply because this is a BlackBerry, a platform fewer and fewer people are using nowadays.. Up your game and the get the most out of your gear with the following extras, hand-picked by our editors:. Still, it’s reasonable to view it in the same light as other smartphones in its price range. For $275 unlocked and non-contract at ShopBlackBerry.com and Amazon, it doesn’t break the bank, though competition is stiff in that ballpark. Motorola’s Moto G (2014) is one of the best mid-range phones, and is available now for $180. The Moto G doesn’t offer LTE speeds like the Leap does, so that can be a big difference if having the fastest connection matters.. The Leap is more of the same from BlackBerry, but it offers an entry point for users seeking a tool rather than a toy at a price they can afford. Those desiring a BlackBerry with more disposable income and greater expectations are better served with the Passport or Classic, but the ones who don’t should manage fine with the Leap, or even the Z30..

BlackBerry OS 10.3.1 with native Android app support (4.3 Jelly Bean API). BlackBerry OS 10 not quite as functional as major rivals. Many thought the days of BlackBerry were numbered yet the company is still here, pushing new phones. The Canadians might not be the leading smartphone manufacturer that it once was, but it's still got a loyal fanbase that the BlackBerry Leap comes to cater to.. You get a 5" HD display, dual-core processor, 2GB RAM, an 8MP shooter and a rich connectivity package - not the kind of specs to make a geek's pulse race, but adequate for the mid-range that the Leap is targeting. The design is instantly recognizable - square edges, plastic unibody and dotted rear panel with a huge BlackBerry logo. It's more of the classic kind, rather than modern or fresh, but that's a good thing to say for a business-oriented phone.. The BlackBerry Leap is hardly a hero device set to lift the profile of the company - instead it's a workhorse that should bring in some extra sales and help keep the maker afloat until it figures out its next strategic move. And on paper it looks capable of handling the task.. Of course we shouldn't forget that competition in the mid-range has never been this fierce. What was once a land of underperforming handsets trying to replicate flagships designs with cheaper materials and often failing spectacularly now hosts a bunch of very solid smartphones that can cater to the needs of many a power user. The Leap needs to convince us it's got what it takes to compete there, offering enough standout features to attract attention and a well-balanced experience to make customers reach for their wallets.. Let's see how this one goes - we start with the unboxing and hardware inspection after the break.. BlackBerry Leap specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (45).

I have to recommend the Leap. The UX of Blackberry 10.3 is superb. BB Hub makes keeping on top of all your communications a single gesture away. The gesture driven interface makes single hand operation smooth. The battery life meets or exceeds promises with an easy full day - part of this is the slightly less powerful processor which drains less, but provides superb response nonetheless. The build quality is superb and the screen is brilliant in full sunlight. Blackberry keyboard even on screen is best in class. The Blackberry Leap works for me and the price point on the Leap makes it any easy recommendation. I know it is not technically the best phone, but it works for me. I have always used BlackBerry and it works for me. BlackBerry Blend is particularly useful as I have left my phone at home before!.

A revamped version of the Z10. What is a hands on review?. The BlackBerry Leap is affordable, but not cheap. It looks expensive and sports a smart design and good battery life, but the processor is an oddity. Overall, it's a solid, rather impressive piece of kit.. Early verdict Check out the rest of our MWC 2015 coverage. BlackBerry didn't take any chances with the Leap, in terms of attempting to recapture the hip and cool audience of young professionals – and it might just work.. This smartphone looks a lot like the Z10 externally, but internally, they're practically twins. On the outside, the Leap feels sturdy and solid, with its textured curved back enhancing grip, not to mention adding character to a product which is aimed at an audience which craves just that.. It's just about the right thickness and comfortably fit in my palm despite its dimensions (144 x 73 x 9.5mm). The rest is pretty much what you'd expect from an entry-level smartphone aspiring to be a mid-tier model. Still, it carries a recommended price of $279 (about £180, AU$360) but will very likely sell for much less than that at launch.. An 8-megapixel rear camera is paired with a 2-megapixel front-facing snapper, and full HD video recording is possible. The Leap has a 5-inch 720p display, and a microSD card reader plus a SIM slot on one side, with a microUSB port on the bottom. 802.11n Wi-Fi (dual-band) is on board, and Bluetooth 4.0, but there's no NFC .. Inside resides a 2,800mAh battery that can power the phone for up to 25 hours according to BlackBerry.. The headset jack and the power button are located on the top, while the volume up/down and mute buttons are on the right-hand side (when looking at the screen).. The BlackBerry Leap sports 2GB of RAM, 16GB of on-board storage and as strange as it sounds, a three-year-old processor – the MSM8960 – last seen in the BlackBerry Q10 and the Z10.. While the first two elements are perfectly adequate for an entry-level phone, the presence of the MSM8960, even if clocked at 1.5GHz, comes as a surprise.. That said, it is a former top of the range System-on-Chip which powered the likes of the Galaxy S3 , the Nokia Lumia 820 and the Motorola Droid Razr M. And indeed, it should outscore competing SoCs even after three years on computational and graphics-oriented tasks thanks to its Adreno 225 GPU.. The screen looks great and the Leap proved to be very responsive during my brief interaction with it.. As expected, the Leap runs BlackBerry 10.3.1 which offers, amongst other things, a virtual keyboard. You also get both BlackBerry's own app store, World, as well as Amazon's store plus a raft of apps like Blend, Assistant and Hub.. The Leap is probably the best shot BlackBerry has to stabilise or even improve its ever-shrinking market share. For the price, you get some decent hardware – 2GB is unheard of in the sub-£200 price bracket, even for Android smartphones. BlackBerry said that users shouldn't be concerned about the number of cores the processor has or its clock speed, and I tend to agree. Unfortunately, the market is likely to judge the phone based on those two variables.. What is a hands on review?. 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours.

This article is about the brand of electronic devices. For its parent company, see BlackBerry Limited. For the fruit, see Blackberry. For other uses, see Blackberry (disambiguation) .. BlackBerry is a line of smartphones , tablets , and services originally designed and marketed by Canadian company BlackBerry Limited (formerly known as Research In Motion Limited). [1] These are currently designed, manufactured, and marketed by TCL Communication , BlackBerry Mobile , BB Merah Putih , and Optiemus for the global, Indonesian, and Indian markets, respectively, continuously using the BlackBerry brand.. BlackBerry was considered one of the most prominent smartphone vendors in the world, specializing in secure communications and mobile productivity. At its peak in September 2013, there were 85 million BlackBerry subscribers worldwide. [2] [3] However, BlackBerry has since lost its dominant position in the market due to the success of the Android and iOS platforms; the same numbers had fallen to 23 million in March 2016. The BlackBerry line traditionally uses a proprietary operating system developed by BlackBerry Limited known as BlackBerry OS. In 2013, BlackBerry introduced BlackBerry 10 , a major revamp of the platform based on QNX operating system. BlackBerry 10 was meant to replace the aging BlackBerry OS platform with a new system that was more in line with the user experiences of modern smartphone operating systems. The first BB10 powered device was the BlackBerry Z10 , which was followed by other all-touch and keyboard-equipped models; including the BlackBerry Q10 , BlackBerry Classic , BlackBerry Passport , and the BlackBerry Leap .. In 2015, BlackBerry re-focused its business strategy and began to release Android-based smartphones, beginning with the BlackBerry Priv slider and then the BlackBerry DTEK50. On September 28, 2016, Blackberry announced it would cease designing its own phones in favour of licensing to partners. 3.2 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011 & 2012 outages. 3.3 Phones with BlackBerry email client. 7 RIM patent infringement litigation. 9 Security agencies access. 10.1 President Barack Obama. 10.3 Use by government forces. 10.4 Use by transportation staff. 11 Competition and financial results. Mike Lazaridis - Founder and former co-CEO of BlackBerry. RIM, founded in Waterloo, Ontario, first developed the Inter@ctive Pager 900, announced on September 18, 1996. The Inter@ctive Pager 900 was a clamshell -type device that allowed two-way paging. [6] After the success of the 900, the Inter@ctive Pager 800 was created for IBM, which bought US$10 million worth of them on February 4, 1998. [7] The next device to be released was the Inter@ctive Pager 950, on August 26, 1998. The very first device to carry the BlackBerry name was the BlackBerry 850, an email pager, released January 19, 1999. Although identical in appearance to the 950, the 850 was the first device to integrate email and the name Inter@ctive Pager was no longer used to brand the device.. The first BlackBerry device, the 850, was introduced in 1999 as a two-way pager in Munich, Germany. [8] The name BlackBerry was coined by the marketing company Lexicon Branding. The name was chosen due to the resemblance of the keyboard's buttons to that of the drupelets that compose the blackberry fruit. The original BlackBerry devices, the RIM 850 and 857, used the DataTAC network. In 2002, the more commonly known convergent smartphone BlackBerry was released, which supports push email, mobile telephone, text messaging, Internet faxing , Web browsing and other wireless information services. BlackBerry gained market share in the mobile industry by concentrating on email. BlackBerry began to offer email service on non-BlackBerry devices, such as the Palm Treo , through the proprietary BlackBerry Connect software.. The original BlackBerry device had a monochrome display while newer models installed color displays. All newer models have been optimized for " thumbing ", the use of only the thumbs to type on a keyboard. The Storm 1 and Storm 2 include a SureType keypad for typing. Originally, system navigation was achieved with the use of a scroll wheel mounted on the right side of device models prior to the 8700. The trackwheel was replaced by the trackball with the introduction of the Pearl series, which allowed four-way scrolling. The trackball was replaced by the optical trackpad with the introduction of the Curve 8500 series. Models made to use iDEN networks, such as Nextel , SouthernLINC , NII Holdings , and Mike also incorporate a push-to-talk (PTT) feature, similar to a two-way radio .. On January 30, 2013, BlackBerry announced the release of the Z10 and Q10 smartphones. Both models consist of touch screens: the Z10 features an all-touch design [12] and the Q10 combines a QWERTY keyboard with touchscreen features. During the second financial quarter of 2013, BlackBerry sold 6.8 million handsets, but was eclipsed by the sales of competitor Nokia's Lumia model for the first time. On August 12, 2013, BlackBerry announced the intention to sell the company due to their increasingly unfavourable financial position and competition in the mobile industry. [15] Largely due to lower than expected sales on the Z10 , BlackBerry announced on September 20, 2013 that 4,500 full- and part-time positions (an estimated 40% of its operating staff) have been terminated and its product line has been reduced from six to four models. [16] On September 23, 2013, Fairfax Financial , which owns a 10% equity stake in BlackBerry, made an offer to acquire BlackBerry for $4.7 billion (at $9.00 per share). Following the announcement, BlackBerry announced an acceptance of the offer provisionally but it would continue to seek other offers until November 4, 2013. On November 4, 2013, BlackBerry replaced Thorsten Heins with new interim CEO John S. Chen , the former CEO of Sybase. [18] On November 8, the BlackBerry board rejected proposals from several technology companies for various BlackBerry assets on grounds that a break-up did not serve the interest of all stakeholders, which include employees, customers and suppliers in addition to shareholders, said the sources, who did not want to be identified as the discussions were confidential. [19] On November 13, 2013, Chen released an open message: "We are committed to reclaiming our success." [20]. In early July 2014, the TechCrunch online publication published an article titled "BlackBerry Is One Of The Hottest Stocks Of 2014, Seriously", following a 50 percent rise in the company's stock, an increase that was greater than peer companies such as Apple and Google; however, an analysis of BlackBerry's financial results showed that neither revenue or profit margin were improved, but, instead, costs were markedly reduced. During the same period, BlackBerry also introduced the new Passport handset. — consisting of a 4.5 inches (11. cm) square screen with "Full HD-class" (1,440 x 1,440) resolution and marketed to professional fields such as healthcare and architecture. — promoted its Messenger app and released minor updates for the BB10 mobile operating system. On December 17, 2014, the BlackBerry Classic was introduced; it is meant to be more in line with the former Bold series, incorporating navigation buttons similar to the previous BlackBerry OS devices. In September 2015, BlackBerry officially unveiled the BlackBerry Priv , a slider phablet that utilizes the Android operating system with additional security and productivity-oriented features inspired by the BlackBerry operating systems. [24] [25] [26] [27] However, BlackBerry COO Marty Beard told Bloomberg that "The company’s never said that we would not build another BB10 device." [28]. On July 26, 2016 the company hinted that another model with a physical keyboard was "coming shortly". The same day, BlackBerry unveiled a mid-range Android model with only an on-screen keyboard, the BlackBerry DTEK50 , powered by the latest version of Android, 6.0, Marshmallow. (The Priv could also be upgraded to 6.0) This device featured a 5.2-inch full high-definition display. BlackBerry chief security officer David Kleidermacher stressed data security during the launch, indicating that this model included built-in malware protection and encryption of all user information. [29] [30] Industry observers pointed out that the DTEK50 is a re-branded version of the Alcatel Idol 4 with additional security-oriented software customizations, manufactured and designed by TCL. In September 2016, BlackBerry Limited agreed to a licensing partnership with an Indonesian company to set up a new joint venture company called "BB Merah Putih" to "source, distribute, and market BlackBerry handsets in Indonesia". On October 25, 2016, BlackBerry released the BlackBerry DTEK60 , the second device in the DTEK series, manufactured and designed by TCL. The device features a 5.5-inch Quad-HD touch screen display running on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 processor with support for Quick Charge 3.0, USB Type-C, and a fingerprint sensor. In October 2016, it was announced that Blackberry will be working with the Ford Motor Company of Canada to develop software for the car manufacturer's connected vehicles. In February 2017, a $20m class action lawsuit against Blackberry was announced by the former employees of the company. In March 2017, BB Merah Putih announced the BlackBerry Aurora, an Indonesian-made and sold device, running an operating system based on Android 7.0 out of the box.. Modern LTE based phones such as the BlackBerry Z10 have a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Plus , a proprietary Qualcomm SOC which is based on ARMv7-A architecture, featuring two 1.5. GHz Qualcomm Krait CPU cores, and a 400. GSM -based BlackBerry phones incorporate an ARM 7, 9 or 11 processor. [37] Some of the BlackBerry models (Torch 9850/9860, Torch 9810, and Bold 9900/9930) have a 1.2. GHz MSM8655 Snapdragon S2 SOC, 768 MB system memory, and 8 GB of on-board storage. [37] [38] Entry-level models, such as the Curve 9360, feature a Marvell PXA940 clocked at 800. Some previous BlackBerry devices, such as the Bold 9000, were equipped with Intel XScale 624. [39] The Bold 9700 featured a newer version of the Bold 9000's processor but is clocked at the same speed. The Curve 8520 featured a 512. MHz processor, while BlackBerry 8000 series smartphones, such as the 8700 and the Pearl, are based on the 312. MHz ARM XScale ARMv5TE PXA900. An exception to this is the BlackBerry 8707 which is based on the 80. MHz Qualcomm 3250 chipset; this was due to the PXA900 chipset not supporting 3G networks. MHz processor in the BlackBerry 8707 meant the device was often slower to download and render web pages over 3G than the 8700 was over EDGE networks. Early BlackBerry devices, such as the BlackBerry 950 , used Intel 80386 -based processors. BlackBerry's latest Flagship phone the BlackBerry Z30 based on a 5" Super AMOLED, 1280x720 resolution, at 295 ppi 24-bit color depth and powered by Quad-Graphics and Qualcomm's Dual Core 1.7. The first BlackBerry with an Android operating system was released in late November 2015, the 192 gram/6.77 ounce BlackBerry Priv ,. [42] It launched with version 5.1.1 but was later upgraded to version 6.0 Android Marshmallow. It was first available in four countries but increased to 31 countries by February 28, 2016. [43] Employing a Qualcomm 8992 Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core, 64 bit, Adreno 418, 600. MHz GPU with 3GB RAM processor, this unit is equipped with a curved 5.4-inch (2560 x 1440) OLED display and a sliding QWERTY keyboard which is hidden when not in use; Google's voice recognition that allows for dictating e-mails is also available. The Priv retained the best BlackBerry 10 features. Its 3,410mAh battery is said to provide 22.5 hours of mixed use. The 18-megapixel camera, with a Schneider-Kreuznach lens, can also record 4K video; a secondary selfie camera is also provided. Several important apps unique to the Priv were available from Google Play by mid December. A new operating system , BlackBerry 10 , was released for two new BlackBerry models (Z10 and Q10) on January 30, 2013. At BlackBerry World 2012, RIM CEO Thorsten Heins demonstrated some of the new features of the OS, including a camera which is able to rewind frame-by-frame separately of individual faces in an image, to allow selection of the best of different shots, which is then stitched seamlessly to an optimal composite, [45] an intelligent, predictive , and adapting keyboard, and a gesture based user interface designed around the idea of "peek" and "flow". [46] Apps are available for BlackBerry 10 devices through the BlackBerry World storefront.. The previous operating system developed for older BlackBerry devices was BlackBerry OS , a proprietary multitasking environment developed by RIM. The operating system is designed for use of input devices such as the track wheel, track ball, and track pad. The OS provides support for Java MIDP 1.0 and WAP 1.2. Previous versions allowed wireless synchronisation with Microsoft Exchange Server email and calendar, as well as with Lotus Domino email. OS 5.0 provides a subset of MIDP 2.0, and allows complete wireless activation and synchronisation with Exchange email, calendar, tasks, notes and contacts, and adds support for Novell GroupWise and Lotus Notes. The BlackBerry Curve 9360, BlackBerry Torch 9810, Bold 9900/9930, Curve 9310/9320 and Torch 9850/9860 featured the 2011 BlackBerry OS 7. Apps are available for these devices through BlackBerry World (which before 2013 was called BlackBerry App World).. Third-party developers can write software using these APIs, and proprietary BlackBerry APIs as well. Any application that makes use of certain restricted functionality must be digitally signed so that it can be associated to a developer account at RIM. This signing procedure guarantees the authorship of an application but does not guarantee the quality or security of the code. RIM provides tools for developing applications and themes for BlackBerry. Applications and themes can be loaded onto BlackBerry devices through BlackBerry World, Over The Air (OTA) through the BlackBerry mobile browser, or through BlackBerry Desktop Manager.. BlackBerry devices, as well as Android, iOS, and Windows Phone platforms, have the ability to use the proprietary BlackBerry Messenger , also known as BBM, software for sending and receiving encrypted instant messages, voice notes, images and videos via BlackBerry PIN. As long as your cell phone has a data plan these messages are all free of charge. Some of the features of BBM include groups, bar-code scanning, lists, shared calendars, BBM Music and integration with apps and games using the BBM social platform.. In April 2013, BlackBerry announced that it was shutting down its streaming music service, BBM Music, which was active for almost two years since its launch. BlackBerry Messenger Music closed on June 2, 2013. In July 2014, BlackBerry revealed BlackBerry Assistant, a new feature for BlackBerry OS 10.3, and BlackBerry Passport hardware. The feature is a digital personal assistant to help keep you "organized, informed and productive." [48]. In December 2014, BlackBerry and NantHealth , a healthcare-focused data provider, launched a secure cancer genome browser, giving doctors the ability to access patients' genetic data on the BlackBerry Passport smartphone. BlackBerry held in hand featuring all the different selective hardware and software on the screen.. BlackBerry smartphones can be integrated into an organization's email system through a software package called BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) through version 5, and BlackBerry Enterprise Service (BES) as of version 10. (There were no versions 6 through 9.). Versions of BES are available for Microsoft Exchange , Lotus Domino , Novell GroupWise and Google Apps. While individual users may be able to use a wireless provider's email services without having to install BES themselves, organizations with multiple users usually run BES on their own network. BlackBerry devices running BlackBerry OS 10 or later can also be managed directly by a Microsoft Exchange Server, using Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) polices, in the same way that an iOS or Android device can. (EAS supports fewer management controls than BES does.) Some third-party companies provide hosted BES solutions. Every BlackBerry has a unique ID called a BlackBerry PIN, which is used to identify the device to the BES. BlackBerry at one time provided a free BES software called BES Express (BESX). The primary BES feature is to relay email from a corporate mailbox to a BlackBerry phone. The BES monitors the user's mailbox, relaying new messages to the phone via BlackBerry's Network Operations Center (NOC) and user's wireless provider. This feature is known as push email , because all new emails, contacts, task entries, memopad entries, and calendar entries are pushed out to the BlackBerry device immediately (as opposed to the user synchronising the data manually or having the device poll the server at intervals).. BlackBerry also supports polling email, through third-party applications. The messaging system built into the BlackBerry only understands how to receive messages from a BES or the BIS, these services handle the connections to the user's mail providers. Device storage also enables the mobile user to access all data off-line in areas without wireless service. When the user reconnects to wireless service, the BES sends the latest data.. A feature of the newer models of the BlackBerry is their ability to quickly track the user's current location through trilateration without the use of GPS, thus saving battery life and time. Trilateration can be used as a quick, less battery intensive way to provide location-aware applications with the co-ordinates of the user. However, the accuracy of BlackBerry trilateration is less than that of GPS due to a number of factors, including cell tower blockage by large buildings, mountains, or distance.. BES also provides phones with TCP/IP connectivity accessed through a component called MDS (Mobile Data System) Connection Service. [51] This allows custom application development using data streams on BlackBerry devices based on the Sun Microsystems Java ME platform.. In addition, BES provides network security, in the form of Triple DES [52] or, more recently, AES [53] encryption [54] [55] of all data (both email and MDS traffic) that travels between the BlackBerry phone and a BlackBerry Enterprise Server.. Most providers offer flat monthly pricing via special Blackberry tariffs for unlimited data between BlackBerry units and BES. In addition to receiving email, organizations can make intranets or custom internal applications with unmetered traffic .. With more recent versions of the BlackBerry platform, the MDS is no longer a requirement for wireless data access. Starting with OS 3.8 or 4.0, BlackBerry phones can access the Internet (i.e. TCP/IP access) without an MDS – formerly only email and WAP access was possible without a BES/MDS. The BES/MDS is still required for secure email, data access, and applications that require WAP from carriers that do not allow WAP access.. The primary alternative to using BlackBerry Enterprise Server is to use the BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS). BlackBerry Internet Service is available in 91 countries internationally. BlackBerry Internet Service was developed primarily for the average consumer rather than for the business consumer. The service allows users to access POP3 , IMAP , and Outlook Web App (not via Exchange ActiveSync ) email accounts without connecting through a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). [56] BlackBerry Internet Service allows up to 10 email accounts to be accessed, including proprietary as well as public email accounts (such as Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo and AOL). BlackBerry Internet Service also supports the push capabilities of various other BlackBerry Applications. Various applications developed by RIM for BlackBerry utilise the push capabilities of BIS, such as the Instant Messaging clients (like Google Talk, Windows Live Messenger and Yahoo Messenger). The MMS, PIN, interactive gaming, mapping and trading applications [ which? ] require data plans like BIS (not just Wi-Fi) for use. The service is usually provisioned through a mobile phone service provider, though BlackBerry actually runs the service. At various stages of the company's history it suffered occasional service outages that have been referred to in the media as "embarrassing". In 2005 the company suffered a relatively short-term outage reportedly among a small handful of North America carriers. [59] The service was resorted after several hours.. In 2007 the e-mail service suffered an outage which led for calls by some questioning the integrity towards BlackBerry's perceived centralized system. In 2009 the company had an outage reportedly covering the whole of North America. At 2011-10-10 10:00 UTC began a multi-day outage in Europe, the Middle East and Africa , affecting millions of BlackBerry users. [62] There was another outage the following day. [63] By October 12, 2011, the Blackberry Internet Service went down in North America. [64] Research In Motion attributed data overload due to switch failures in their two data centres in Waterloo in Canada and Slough in England as the cause of the service disruptions. [64] [65] The outage intensified calls by shareholders for a shake-up in the company's leadership. [66] [67] Some estimates by BlackBerry are that the company lost between $50 million [68] to $54 million due to global email service failure and outage in 2011. Several non-BlackBerry mobile phones have been released featuring the BlackBerry email client which connects to BlackBerry servers. Many of these phones have full QWERTY keyboards.. Third-party software available for use on BlackBerry devices includes full-featured database management systems , which can be used to support customer relationship management clients and other applications that must manage large volumes of potentially complex data. In March 2011, RIM announced an optional Android player that could play applications developed for the Android system would be available for the BlackBerry PlayBook , RIM's first entry in the tablet market. On August 24, 2011 Bloomberg News reported unofficial rumors that BlackBerry devices would be able to run Android applications when RIM brings QNX and the Android App Player to BlackBerry. [75] [76] [77] [78] On October 20, 2011 RIM officially announced that Android applications could run, unmodified, on the BlackBerry tablet and the newest BlackBerry phones, using the newest version of its operating system. Main article: List of BlackBerry products. Many BlackBerry retail stores operate outside North America , such as in Thailand , Indonesia , United Arab Emirates , and Mexico. [83] [84] In December 2007 a BlackBerry Store opened in Farmington Hills, Michigan. The store offers BlackBerry device models from AT&T , T-Mobile , Verizon , and Sprint , the major U.S. There were three prior attempts at opening BlackBerry stores in Toronto and London (UK), [85] but they eventually folded. [86] There are also BlackBerry Stores operated by Wireless Giant at airports in Atlanta , Boston , Charlotte , Minneapolis-St. Paul , Philadelphia , Houston , and Newark , [87] but several have been slated for closing. On September 23, 2015, Blackberry opened its first pop-up store in Frankfurt, Germany.. The BlackBerry PIN ( P ersonal I dentification N umber) is an eight-character hexadecimal identification number assigned to each BlackBerry device. PINs cannot be changed manually on the device (though BlackBerry technicians are able to reset or update a PIN server-side), and are locked to each specific BlackBerry. BlackBerry devices can message each other using the PIN directly or by using the BlackBerry Messenger application. BlackBerry PINs are tracked by BlackBerry Enterprise Servers and the BlackBerry Internet Service and are used to direct messages to a BlackBerry device. Emails and any other messages, such as those from the BlackBerry Push Service, are typically directed to a BlackBerry device's PIN. The message can then be routed by a RIM Network Operations Center , and sent to a carrier, which will deliver the message the last mile to the device. In September 2012 RIM announced that the BlackBerry PIN would be replaced by users' BlackBerry ID starting in 2013 with the launch of the BlackBerry 10 platform. In 2000 NTP sent notice of its wireless email patents to a number of companies and offered to license the patents to them. NTP brought a patent-infringement lawsuit against one of the companies, Research In Motion, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. This court is well known for its strict adherence to timetables and deadlines, sometimes referred to as the " rocket docket ", and is particularly efficient at trying patent cases. The jury eventually found that the NTP patents were valid; furthermore, the jury established that RIM had infringed the patents in a "willful" manner, and the infringement had cost NTP US$33 million in damages (the greater of a reasonable royalty or lost profits). Spencer , increased the damages to US$53 million as a punitive measure due to the willful nature of the infringement. He also instructed RIM to pay NTP's legal fees of US$4.5 million and issued an injunction ordering RIM to cease and desist infringing the patents—this decision would have resulted in the closure of BlackBerry's systems in the US. [90] RIM appealed all of the findings of the court. The injunction and other remedies were stayed pending the outcome of the appeals.. In March 2005 during appeal, RIM and NTP tried to negotiate a settlement of their dispute; the settlement was to be for $450 million. Negotiations broke down due to other issues. On June 10, 2005, the matter returned to the courts. In early November 2005 the US Department of Justice filed a brief requesting that RIM's service be allowed to continue because of the large number of BlackBerry users in the US Federal Government. In January 2006 the US Supreme Court refused to hear RIM's appeal of the holding of liability for patent infringement, and the matter was returned to a lower court. The prior granted injunction preventing all RIM sales in the US and use of the BlackBerry device might have been enforced by the presiding district court judge had the two parties been unable to reach a settlement.. On February 9, 2006, the US Department of Defense (DOD) filed a brief stating that an injunction shutting down the BlackBerry service while excluding government users was unworkable. The DOD also stated that the BlackBerry was crucial for national security given the large number of government users.. On February 9, 2006, RIM announced that it had developed software workarounds that would not infringe the NTP patents, and would implement those if the injunction was enforced.. On March 3, 2006, after a stern warning from Judge Spencer, RIM and NTP announced that they had settled their dispute. Under the terms of the settlement, RIM has agreed to pay NTP $612.5 million (USD) in a "full and final settlement of all claims." In a statement, RIM said that "all terms of the agreement have been finalized and the litigation against RIM has been dismissed by a court order this afternoon. The agreement eliminates the need for any further court proceedings or decisions relating to damages or injunctive relief." The settlement amount is believed low by some analysts, because of the absence of any future royalties on the technology in question. On May 26, 2017, BlackBerry announced that it had reached an agreement with Qualcomm Incorporated resolving all amounts payable in connection with the interim arbitration decision announced on April 12, 2017. Following a joint stipulation by the parties, the arbitration panel has issued a final award providing for the payment by Qualcomm to BlackBerry of a total amount of U.S.$940,000,000 including interest and attorneys' fees, net of certain royalties due from BlackBerry for calendar 2016 and the first quarter of calendar 2017. The BCESA, BlackBerry Certified Enterprise Sales Associate qualification, is the first of three levels of professional BlackBerry Certification.. More information on certifications is on the BlackBerry.com website. The BlackBerry Technical Certifications available are:. Research in Motion agreed to give access to private communications to the governments of United Arab Emirates [95] and Saudi Arabia [96] in 2010, and India in 2012. [97] The Saudi and UAE governments had threatened to ban certain services because their law enforcement agencies could not decrypt messages between people of interest. It was revealed as a part of the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures that the American and British intelligence agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) respectively, have access to the user data on BlackBerry devices. The agencies are able to read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, e-mails, and notes through BlackBerry Internet Service, which operates outside corporate networks, and which, in contrast to the data passing through internal BlackBerry services (BES), only compresses but does not encrypt data. Documents stated that the NSA was able to access the BlackBerry e-mail system and that they could "see and read SMS traffic." [99] There was a brief period in 2009 when the NSA was unable to access BlackBerry devices, after BlackBerry changed the way they compress their data. Access to the devices was re-established by GCHQ. [99] GCHQ has a tool named SCRAPHEAP CHALLENGE, with the capability of "Perfect spoofing of emails from Blackberry targets". In response to the revelations BlackBerry officials stated that "It is not for us to comment on media reports regarding alleged government surveillance of telecommunications traffic" and added that a "back door pipeline" to their platform had not been established and did not exist. It should be noted that similar access by the intelligence agencies to other mobile devices exists, using similar techniques to hack into them. The BlackBerry software includes support for the Dual EC DRBG CSPRNG algorithm which, due to being probably backdoored by the NSA , the US National Institute of Standards and Technology "strongly recommends" no longer be used. has however not issued an advisory to its customers, because they do not consider the probable backdoor a vulnerability. also owns US patent 2007189527, which covers the technical design of the backdoor. President Obama with his BlackBerry in its holster on a flight to Caen, Normandy, France, 2009.. The (formerly) advanced encryption capabilities of the BlackBerry Smartphone made it eligible for use by government agencies and state forces.. The President of the United States, Barack Obama , became known for his dependence on a BlackBerry device for communication during his 2008 Presidential campaign. Despite the security issues, he insisted on using it even after inauguration. [103] This was seen by some as akin to a "celebrity endorsement," which marketing experts have estimated to be worth between $25 and $50 million. [104] His usage of BlackBerry continued until around the end of his presidency. The Hillary Clinton email controversy is associated with Hillary Clinton continuing to use her BlackBerry after assuming the office of Secretary of State. An example is the West Yorkshire Police , which has allowed the increase in the presence of police officers along the streets and a reduction in public spending, given that each officer could perform desk work directly via the mobile device, [107] as well as in several other areas and situations. [108] The US Federal Government and Department of Defense were also prominent examples of BlackBerry device users, the latter agency even stating that the BlackBerry smartphone was "essential for national security" [ citation needed ] because of the large number of BlackBerry users in the government. The high encryption standard that made BlackBerry smartphones and the PlayBook tablet unique, have since been implemented in other devices, [109] including most Apple devices released after the iPhone 4. The Bangalore City Police is one of the few police departments in India along with the Pune Police and Kochi Police to use BlackBerry devices. In the United Kingdom , South West Trains and Northern Rail have issued BlackBerry devices to guards in order to improve the communication between control, guards and passengers. In Canada , Toronto and many other municipalities within Canada have issued BlackBerry devices to most of its employees including but not limited to transportation, technical, water and operations inspection staff and all management staff in order to improve the communication between contracted construction companies, its winter maintenance operations and to assist and successfully organize multimillion-dollar contracts. The devices are the standard mobile device to receive e-mail redirected from GroupWise. The City's e-mail environment is currently set up to support "ONLY" BlackBerry devices. As part of their Internet of Things endeavours, the company announced plans of moving into the shipping industry by adapting the smartphones devices to the communication necessities of freight containers. Eric Schmidt , Executive Chairman of Google , is a longtime BlackBerry user. Although smartphones running Google's Android mobile operating system compete with BlackBerry, Schmidt said in a 2013 interview that he uses a BlackBerry because he prefers its keyboard. The Italian criminal group known as the 'Ndrangheta was reported on February 2009 to have communicated overseas with the Gulf Cartel , a Mexican drug cartel, through the use of the BlackBerry Messenger, since the BBM Texts are "very difficult to intercept". The primary competitors of the BlackBerry are Android smartphones and the iPhone. BlackBerry has struggled to compete against both and its market share has plunged since 2011, leading to speculation that it will be unable to survive as an independent going concern. [117] However, it has managed to maintain significant positions in some markets. Despite market share loss, on a global basis, the number of active BlackBerry subscribers has increased substantially through the years. For example, for the fiscal period during which the Apple iPhone was first released, RIM reported that they had a subscriber base of 10.5 million BlackBerry subscribers. [119] At the end of 2008, when Android first hit the market, RIM reported that the number of BlackBerry subscribers had increased to 21 million. [120] [121] Finally, in the quarter ended June 28, 2012, RIM announced that the number of BlackBerry subscribers had reached 78 million globally. [122] After the release of the Apple iPhone 5 in September 2012 RIM CEO Thorsten Heins announced that the current global subscribers is up to 80 million, which sparked a 7% jump in shares. However, since then, BlackBerry's global user base (meaning active accounts) has declined dramatically since its peak of 80 million in June 2012, dropping to 46 million users in September 2014. [124] Its market share globally has also declined to less than 1 percent. In 2011, BlackBerry shipped 43% of all smartphones to Indonesia. By April 2014 this had fallen to 3%. The decline in the Indonesian market share mirrors a global trend for the company (0.6% of North America). [127] The retail price of 2,199,000 Indonesian Rupiah ($189) failed to give BlackBerry the boost it needed in Indonesia. The company launched the device with a discounted offer to the first 1000 purchasers, which resulted in a stampede in the capital in which several people were injured. [127] BlackBerry lost market share in Indonesia despite the launch of the Z3 on May 13, 2014. [128] The new device was given a worldwide launch in the city of Jakarta and came on the back of the news that Research in Motion (RIM) was to cut hardware production costs by outsourcing this to Taiwan-based Foxconn Group. During the report of its third quarter 2015 results on December 18, 2015, the company said that approximately 700,000 handsets had been sold, down from 1.9 million in the same quarter in 2014, and down from 800,000 in Q2 of 2015. The average sale price per unit was up from $240 to $315, however. This should continue to increase with sales of the new Android Priv device which was selling at a premium price ($800 in Canada, for example). In Q3 of 2015, BlackBerry had a net loss of $89 million U.S. or 17 cents per share, but only a $15 million net loss, or three cents per share, when excluding restructuring charges and other one-time items. Revenue was up slightly from a year earlier, at $557 million U.S. $548 million, primarily because of software sales. Chief executive officer John Chen said that he expects the company's software business to grow at (14 percent) or above the market. [130] At the time, the company was not ready to provide sales figures for the Android-based Priv handset which had been released only weeks earlier, and in only four countries at that time, but Chen offered this comment to analysts: "Depending on how Priv does. there is a chance we could achieve or get closer to break-even operating profitability for our overall device business in the (fourth) quarter". Due to a continuous reduction in BlackBerry users, in February 2016 the Blackberry Headquarter in Waterloo, Canada slashed 35 percent of its workforce. [131] By early 2016, Blackberry market share dropped to 0.2%. [132] In Q4 2016, reports indicate Blackberry sold only 207,900 units—equivalent to a 0.0% market share.

Locations > California > Sacramento Region > Blog > BlackBerry Leap Review: The Good, Bad, and Mediocre. BlackBerry Leap Review: The Good, Bad, and Mediocre. BlackBerry Leap Pros Battery – With up to 25 hours of use, the Lithium Ion battery on the Leap sets it apart from the competition. There are few phones on the market that can go through the heavy usage the Leap does and still keep their battery charge. Camera – The BlackBerry Leap boasts an 8 megapixel auto-focus rear camera and a 2 megapixel fixed-focus front camera. Although these specs are not top-of-the-line, the Leap takes decent photos and has a simple user interface. The video quality is excellent, recording 1080p HD videos at 30 fps with automatic video stabilization. Sleek Design – While BlackBerry isn’t widely known for breaking out of the box in its phone design, the Leap stands apart. The clean lines, sharp corners, and simple branding of the BlackBerry Leap mean business. We love how sturdy and solid the phone feels in the hand. Overall, the look of this smartphone leaves a great first impression. BlackBerry 10 Operating System – BlackBerry continues its dominance for business users with the Leap. Running on BlackBerry 10, the Leap is smart and fast. Although not ideal for other uses such as gaming, we were impressed with how fantastic the non-Qwerty keyboard functioned and the ease of use of the device in general. BlackBerry Leap Cons Few App Options – Possibly one of the biggest cons of the BlackBerry Leap is the shortage of app options. This is more of an overall BlackBerry problem rather than the device itself, but it still factors into the purchase decision. BlackBerry World and Amazon just do not have the selection that Google Play or Apple has available. Also, the Leap is most certainly being geared for productivity and young, busy professionals. Who has time for silly apps and games? Display – Although the 5-inch, 720p display is pretty standard for a mid-range phone such as the “Leap”, we felt like it lost visual integrity when exposed to sunlight. While perhaps not a deal-breaker, for a new, stand-out device such as the Leap we were expecting a crisper display. Outdated technology – Sadly, the Leap has the same internal technology as its 2-year-old predecessor, the Z10. As the newest member of the BlackBerry family, we expected new specs in the Leap but are left a little disappointed. The overall performance is still solid, but could be overshadowed by a newer device sooner rather than later. Expert Reviews “… BlackBerry has kept well within its comfort zone and pushed out another mid-range, touchscreen handset that’s marginally divergent from its predecessors. Don’t get me wrong: If a Leap lands on your desk to replace an old work phone, you’ll no doubt get on with it just fine. ” – Jamie Rigg from Engadget.com “ BlackBerry’s latest offering, the Leap, gives users who enjoy an all-touch experience the upgrade that keyboard lovers received with the Classic. It’s aimed at mobile professionals who want an economical way to get the power and security of a BlackBerry at a consumer-friendly price.” – Lynn Greiner from the Financial Post, via pcadvisor.com “. ..the Leap marks a return to the traditional smartphone design that the company adopted for devices such as the BlackBerry Z3. Built with security in mind, the Leap features support for encryption and anti-malware protection; it also can be wiped remotely .” – Michael Andronico from Tom’s Guide Should You Buy a BlackBerry Leap?. The new BlackBerry Leap has hit the shelves and has drawn a curious eye from business professionals all around. As an all-touchscreen device that has been modeled closely to the BlackBerry Z10, the Leap gives the initial impression of a quality device.. BlackBerry is known for creating fast, secure, and streamlined devices for doing business and staying productive. The BlackBerry Leap follows that path as an excellent business device, though it leaves much to be desired in other areas. As a mid-range phone, the “Leap” has a few pros and cons to consider before purchasing.. The new BlackBerry device comes with mixed reviews. Although there was an overwhelmingly positive take on the Leap’s business productivity capabilities, the new smartphone leaves some users wanting more. As mentioned above in the expert reviews, if you happen to receive a BlackBerry Leap as a business phone, then you will certainly be happy with the device. If you are considering purchasing on your own, there may be better choices out there for you..
