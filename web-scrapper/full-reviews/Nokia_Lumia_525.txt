By Praful Yadav | 5 May 2014. After a lot of research i finalized this device as my choice .I have been using the device from past 20 days.And my opinion is :. The device performance is Buttery Smooth,Windows UI is Awesome.I suggest this phone for those who are bored with laggy android,those who cannot afford a high end android.. Almost all important apps are now available on WP store except very few which we use hardly. Never think that WP store does'nt have apps or so !. Performance : yes performance is superb in this price range, I bet you,show me a single smartphone other than windows,in this price range that performs really good ! We cant find any !. Microsoft has given high priority for the Privacy of customers and this is the reason there are many limitations in the OS.Hopefully at least few will be addressed in next update.. Camera is excellent during daytime but Nights its not !. Though there are no customizations as of now,Microsoft is working on WP 8.1 which adds many customizations.. And never ever compare WP and Android ! Android took nearly 7 years to reach the position which it is enjoying now,but WP is just two years old.It takes time.. Most Of the people have complaint regarding the Battery Life.. --> This is because most of them put over charge before the first usage(6 hrs ++).Those days were gone.. --> If you are getting a new phone,then just charge it to 100% and use the phone normally for a couple of days(lets say 4 to 6 days or a week).And never operate your phone when its charging(Only during these days),mainly do not play games.. -->after a week or so play with your phone as you want, No restrictions.. Note : This is not from any source or article, This is from my personal experience.. -->My phone gives a back up of 1 day + 5 hours On "moderate--heavy" usage. And on light usage i get 2+ days back up.. Moderate--heavy Usage : Wifi Always on,Whatsapp,hike,Browsing Via Internet Explorer,Subway surfers + 2 or 3 games,calls.Streaming(at times only).. Light usage : Calls,messages,Few normal games.No wifi or data.. ** Hope this review helps for those who decide to buy this phone**. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 6 out of 6 people found this review helpful. By Vivek Bharadwaj | 20 May 2014. i don't know why people are going crazy about android phone,this is the best phone i have seen in this range.my sister have bought this phone in February from the local store.. 2.1gb ram = high performance(no lag).. 3.can play all the high-end games like asphalt 8 airborne,temple run 2,subway surfer etc.. 4.great camera with auto-focus and good for video.. 5.have better interface than android phones(you will love it,if u will use it). 6.nice ips display and very smooth touch.. 1.does not have camera flashlight so in night camera performance decreases but still gives nice photos.. 2.because of windows OS some apps are available at nokia store after a week or a month as comparison to android store.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 2 out of 2 people found this review helpful. Detail and true review of Lumia 525. By sudip patil | 14 May 2014. I am using this phone since 2 months. It has been great experience for me. I gave it 4 star rating out of 5 because of its seamless performance, good battery life, good experience of Microsoft apps like OFFICE and XBOX, good camera apps and Here Drive navigation.. The things I liked in this phone are. Its a 4" device which fits perfectly in hand. You can use this device by one hand without any troubles. The rubberized mat finish on the back gives a smooth and strong hold on the phone. The back panel doesn't attract fingerprints ans scratches easily.. Though its not a HD screen but it gives a good performance. You can use it with gloves also.. I am using WP 8.1 (Developers Preview) on my lumia. There are lot of new features added by Microsoft to this update like Transparent Tiles, VPN, Notification Center and Best feature is CORTANA (Digital Voice Assistance). This Os is truly developing day by day. There are very less bugs in this developers preview.. I played lot of games on this device, Never found any kind of lag while playing games (Except Temple Run 2) because of 1 Ghz Dual core processor and 1GB RAM. I never found any kind of lag while multitasking. It captures decent photos in daylight but as there is no flash provided,its not useful in low light. Some times it gets heated near the camera while using 3G or playing High graphics games.. As WP OS is a developing OS, we should give it some time to compare with Android App ecosystem. Lot of famous apps are already there and many more are coming on this platform.. I will recommend this phone for the person who loves to play high graphic games, who is happy with decent camera performance, who is bored of Android, who wants good battery life ,user friendly OS and whose budget is around 10000 Rs. Its a good phone in this price segment.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.

Low pixel density screen (235 ppi). Nokia 525 is an affordable music-centric Windows Phone 8 smartphone with 4" IPS WVGA display, 5MP camera and powered by a 1GHz dual-core processor.. Nokia Lumia 525 Review Nokia Lumia 525 manual Nokia Lumia 525 benchmarks. Dimensions: 4.72 x 2.52 x 0.39 inches (119.9 x 64 x 9.9 mm). Weight: 4.37 oz (124 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 4.0 inches. Resolution: 480 x 800 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor, Scratch-resistant glass. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 16.90 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 14.0 days (336 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 10.60 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS.

Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording, TTY/TDD. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. GPS, A-GPS, S-GPS, Glonass, Cell ID, Wi-Fi positioning. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Media related to Taken with Nokia Lumia 520 at Wikimedia Commons. The Nokia Lumia 520 is an entry-level Windows Phone 8 smartphone [5] announced by Nokia at the 2013 Mobile World Congress. In September 2013, the Lumia 520 became the best-selling Windows device in the world, selling more units than any other model of Windows phone, PC or tablet. [6] [7] By July 2014, the Lumia 520 has had 12 million activations, and has played a key part for Nokia and Microsoft. A minor successor, the Nokia Lumia 525, was later released.. 1.1 Nokia Lumia 525. The Lumia 520 comes in a slate shape with 4-inch SuperSensitive touchscreen. The viewing angles are slightly reduced compared to other phones in the Lumia line. [9] The Lumia 520 shares the same screen resolution of 800x480 as the more expensive Lumia 620, 720 and 820, and actually has a higher pixel density than the 720. [10] The touchscreen is designed to be sensitive enough that one can use it while wearing gloves or with fingernails.. Aside from the screen, the front of the phone contains the Windows Phone 8 standard Back, Start and Search buttons, along with a speaker. The back houses a sole 5. MP camera sensor with autofocus and two-stage capture, but no LED. The sides of the phone also have standard Windows Phone features, as required by Microsoft – volume keys, camera key, power/lock key, 3.5. mm headphone jack and micro-USB connector, which is also used for charging purposes. The phone does not have a front-facing camera or a digital compass. The Lumia 520 ships with 8. GB (8 × 2 30 bytes) of internal storage with about 3. GB of the storage taken up by the operating system. The Lumia 520 has a 1430. mAh battery, which is larger than the 1300. mAh battery in the Lumia 620. The 520 is also slimmer and lighter than the 620, but at the same time longer and wider due to its bigger screen. To reduce the production costs, the 520 lacks Nokia ClearBlack display, a front-facing camera, NFC , camera flash and a compass. The Nokia Lumia 525 launched as the successor to the Nokia Lumia 520 with nearly the same specifications and appearance. The Lumia 525 doubles the RAM from 512 MB to 1 GB, therefore making it compatible with more demanding games and apps. The back shell is also now glossy instead of matte. [12] [13] It is offered in black, white, orange, and yellow colors which can be swapped via removable shells. This phone was first launched in Singapore on December 14, 2013, followed by an India launch in the first week of January 2014. The Lumia 520 ships with Microsoft Windows Phone 8, as well as exclusive software like Nokia Mix Radio and HERE Maps (featuring turn-by-turn directions, offline maps and navigation, and transit info). The phone received the Lumia Amber software update in mid-2013, which brought numerous bug fixes and improvements, including the ability to capture steadier images, and the Lumia Black update in late 2013.. The Lumia 520 can be upgraded to Windows Phone 8.1 as part of the Lumia Cyan update. [21] Although a port was initially released as an insider preview, the phone will not receive the upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, which has been attributed to being due to having only 512. An Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 port to the phone is underway at XDA Developers , after developers became able to replace the UEFI bootloader used for Windows with the Qualcomm Little Kernel bootloader used to boot Android and other Linux-based operating systems. CNET called the Lumia 520 "tremendous value on an easy-to-use device"; [24] and said of its variant, the Lumia 521, "Though it lacks 4G LTE support, the $150 Nokia Lumia 521 still gives you quite a bit for your money. Pricing is absolutely this phone's primary value proposition, but the essentials all seem to work, the hardware is sturdy, and the camera is better than average." [25]. The price of the Lumia 520 was halved to $50 in the United States and £70 in the UK for Christmas 2013 season. Similar to other budget phones like the Lumia 620 and Lumia 720 , it only has 512. MB of RAM , half the RAM of the first Windows Phone 8 devices, causing certain applications and features to not run. [29] On 27 November 2013, the Nokia Lumia 525 was announced in Singapore. [1] It increases the RAM to 1. GB to allow all Windows Phone features and applications to run.. A special variant, the Nokia Lumia 521, was created for T-Mobile US. The 521 is slightly longer than the 520 at 124.0. mm [31] ), so accessories such as cases and screen protectors manufactured for the 520 do not fit the 521. The Nokia Lumia 521's first retail release was on 27 April 2013. ^ a b Warren, Tom (27 November 2013).

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Chris P.. Nokia - Nokia + Windows - Windows +. 4 Call Quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction You don’t mess with a winning formula, people say, and there’s no device out there that seems to follow that mantra as ardently as the Nokia Lumia 525. The successor to the wildly popular Lumia 520 has some big shoes to fill, as its inheriting quite the responsibility. There’s no dancing around the fact that it was the Lumia 520 that gave Microsoft’s Windows Phone 8 the push it needed to latch onto the honorary third place in the world of mobile. Thanks to its extremely affordable price tag, it drew consumers over to the platform in droves. It falls on the Lumia 525 to extend that streak, and Nokia isn't about to mess this one up. To that end, the two devices are virtually identical on the outside, with some very minor changes under the hood. Will these tweaks to the original recipe prove enough to continue winning smartphone buyers over? Let’s see. In the box: Wall charger microUSB to USB cable In-ear headphones Design Signature Lumia, miniaturized If we were to put the Nokia Lumia 520 and Lumia 525 side by side, you’d have a truly impossible time telling the two apart. A true twin to its predecessor, the Lumia 525 is, on the outside, a complete copy. The same petite proportions are at play here, and there’s still quite some space wasted in plastic. The playful exterior of the Lumia 525 communicates no high-end ambitions, but it looks sturdy and reliable. Unfortunately, we can't say we're happy with Nokia's decision to go back to glossy polycarbonate, as pertains to the rear shell – we much preferred the matte finish of the previous model. Now, this is a one-handed device through and through. It sits comfortably in the hand, thanks to its conservative dimensions and rounded sides. Its angular frame digs into the palm, but we found the presence reassuring rather than unpleasant. The well-placed volume rocker, and power and camera shutter buttons also aid in the overall ergonomics of the phone. They are all confidently edging out from the right side of the Lumia 525, and provide a pronounced feedback on impact. Practicality scored a landslide victory The display is another area that remains firmly unchanged with the Lumia 525. We're still privy to the same highly-sensitive 4-inch, 480x800 resolution IPS LCD panel. This configuration works out to a rather low pixel density of 235 pixels per inch. It's also worth pointing out that the scratch-resistant glass on top, unfortunately, appears to lack an oleophobic treatment, resulting in a shower of greasy smudges. But hey, at least you can use it with gloves on! Color reproduction with Nokia's screen of choice is not perfect, but doesn't leave too much to desire. Sure, colors are less saturated than the best out there, and there's a noticeable pinkish hue to whites, but it's leaps and bounds ahead compared to the average panel in this class. But one area – peak brightness – the display concedes to even inferior solutions out there, and that's just unfortunate. Our bright yellow unit, ironically, is not at all suited for play in the sun..

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Nokia Lumia 525 Compare.

All those parts have to be dirt cheap to manufacture right about now. They're milking it far too much. Adding a little ram and bumping up the price back to $180 is cynical. If they had put in a front camera, slimmed it down, and put in a better screen, I'd justify the pricing. Maybe even add $10 if they wanted to make a bit more profit..

The only thing it really fails on is the lack of micro SD. If you had any type of logic, you would have mentioned that..

That, and Google maps can still re route offline anyhow. Oh, and the battery life on the moto g speaks for itself not needing extra batteries. And microsoft gave xbox live suppport to android simply due to the sheer amount of people using it. I'm sure it isn't the same on wp8 but whatever, you can download it anyhow..

Also, that the battery on the moto g is great. I find myself forgetting to charge it. Your lack of common sense to research something is incredible. I'm not missing XBL, why would I?

Hmm HSN sold a lot of lumia 520's so you can bet the farm Microsoft/Lumia 525 will get the LTE transceiver the 520 has for the American model of this 525 smart phone. 1 gig of ram it will need that to run all the Windows phone store apps the Lumia 525 could not run and to to be easily upgraded to Windows phone 8.1 coming this Summer 2014.

The main difference between these two smartphones is the RAM. The new Lumia 525 consists a 1 GB RAM whereas the older one has a 512 MB RAM. This will bring the mobile gaming much smoother and faster. IPS LCD display is comfortable and easy for the eyes. Up to 17 hours talk time is possible. The 5 mp primary camera will provide you an average good quality photo. But there is no flash so photos in the dark will not be optimal. Another con is that there is no front camera. So if you want to make video calls with your device, this may not be the one you are looking for. In spite of few cons this is a great gadget to consider.. User Rating: 4.28 ( 102 votes).

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Nokia is trying to be something to everyone with its current lineup of Lumias - they come in a variety of shapes, sizes, materials and colours. However the nature of Windows Phone as an OS hasn't made it easy for Nokia hit all the right price points. Nokia's devices were either too premium or too weak to capture the interest of buyers in the critical sub-Rs. That started to change with the introduction of the Lumia 520. With its low price, bright colours and unique design, the Lumia 520 was a breath of fresh air in a dull market segment overflowing with similar-looking Android phones from second-tier brands. According to a recent report , the Lumia 520 accounts for nearly 45 percent of all Windows Phone devices sold in India, and just over 25 percent worldwide.. Even so, there was room for improvement. The Lumia 520 was criticised for coming with only 512MB of RAM and dispensing with a front-facing camera. Honestly, though, the front cameras on phones in this price range are generally so bad that they're unusable anyway, and video chatting isn't popular enough for it to be a significant miss. The low amount of RAM was more of an issue, since people were afraid that heavier apps and games wouldn't run well.. The Lumia 525 is thus a mid-lifecycle update which fixes this problem and leaves pretty much everything else exactly as it was. Nokia has responded to buyers' and reviewers' criticisms and has done what it could without raising costs too drastically. It's good to see that the company is on its toes. Even if this helps sway only a few buyers who were earlier on the fence, every small victory counts.. However, the Lumia 525 is still smaller and weaker than many of the Android options available in its price range. Windows Phone is better than it was, but there's still not guarantee that you'll find all the apps you need or the games you'll see your friends enjoy on their Android phones. Let's see if the Lumia 525 has enough going for it to compensate for these factors.. Look and feel There's no mistaking Nokia's visual identity. The use of bright-coloured polycarbonate was a risky choice, but it's paid off. You might not want to own a bright cyan, magenta or yellow phone, and for that reason they're also available in at least black or white, but you'll always know that these phones are Nokias.. Our review unit had a bright, glossy, almost-fluorescent yellow shell that was sometimes too overpowering to look at. Even when the review unit was lying on its back on a table the side panel was eye-catching enough to be distracting. When viewed head-on, there's about a half-mm border of yellow plastic around the front panel, and that was distracting too! Thankfully, Nokia sells replacement shells in white, orange and yellow, so if you buy this colour only to find it a bit much for your taste later on, you can swap it out.. If you've ever used a Lumia 520, you'll find the 525 identical in terms of dimensions and weight. It's easy enough to hold and use in one hand, and is actually quite small by today's standards. The back is curved nicely, although the front corners are a bit sharp.. Nokia's habit of placing all buttons on the right edge has become a bit of a Lumia trademark: you'll find the volume rocker, standby button and camera shortcut all in a row. It makes sense to have the power button on the side of larger phones, but on this one it winds up being awkwardly out of reach.. You'll find the standard Windows Phone Back, Home and Search buttons below the screen, and nothing but an earpiece and Nokia logo above it. As mentioned already, there's no front-facing camera. There are two sensor cutouts, but they're completely invisible. If it wasn't for the garish colour, we'd actually say this phone looks simple and understated.. All you'll see on the back is the camera lens, a faint Nokia logo, and a small cutout for the loudspeaker. There's no flash, and the lens doesn't need to bulge out either. The shell is highly glossy and rather flat in the middle, so it's likely to get scuffed up over time as you use it.. The shell pops off without too much trouble, but it's too easy to end up pushing the camera lens down for leverage, which leaves it smudged. Underneath, you'll see a traditional removable battery and slots for a single Micro-SIM card and a microSD card positioned such that you'll need to take the battery out to get to them. We noticed that it was necessary to put the shell back on carefully, to make sure the plastic buttons on the shell lined up properly with the contact points on the phone itself.. Nokia's recent phones have shipped with chargers that for some reason have a plastic earthing pin. Phone chargers don't need to be earthed, so the only purpose this could serve would be to open the shutters on modern three-pin sockets. The plastic pin slides inwards so the charger itself isn't much more bulky than usual, but it means you won't be able to use two-pin sockets. The Lumia 525's charger also has a fixed wire, unlike almost every other phone on the market today. For PC syncing there's a separate, but much shorter USB cable.. Features, specifications and software Apart from the doubled amount of RAM, the Lumia 525 is internally identical to the 520. It's powered by a 1GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 Plus, with integrated Adreno 305 graphics. The S4 Plus is acceptable for such a low-end device, but there are quad-core Android models on the market in this price range now. The lone camera can take 5-megapixel stills and 720p videos, but there's no flash.. The screen resolution is 480x800 which was common in the early days of Windows Phone, and now feels about right for a 4-inch screen on a low-end phone. The screen isn't nearly as sharp or accurate as we'd like. There's 8GB of built-in storage and the microSD slot will accept cards up to 64GB in capacity. Nokia has given the Lumia 525 a relatively small 1430mAh battery which is adequate considering that none of the internal components are particularly power-hungry.. A quick dip into the phone's info screen told us that it was running Lumia Black, the latest version of Windows Phone with Nokia's customisations baked in. However, many of the useful little tweaks that we saw on Nokia's higher-end Lumia 1320 and 1520 are missing here: there's no Glance screen and no shortcuts like double-tap-to-wake. You'll also get the less capable Nokia Drive app, rather than Drive+. The difference is that you get navigation and turn-by-turn directions only in India rather than full international coverage.. Nokia Smart Cam lets you take bursts of photos and then either pick the best one or combine them all into an action sequence. You can also blur backgrounds to emphasise motion, merge shots to make sure everyone in a group is smiling, and remove unwanted moving objects. As we've seen even on more capable hardware, it's possible to get good results with the tricks that merge multiple shots, but you'll have to try a few times to make sure people or objects are moving at just the right speed, with just the right background.. There isn't much else to say about the Lumia 525's software. Nokia preloads Zinio, a news aggregation and magazine reader app; Bigflix, for streaming Indian movies; Flipkart's ebook reader; and Nokia Beamer, which lets you stream your screen's contents to a Web browser via the Internet. Of course you get Microsoft Office, Xbox Games and SkyDrive (soon to be renamed to OneDrive) as well.. Camera We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of images captured by the Lumia 525. The only complaint we had with photos taken in daylight was that they tended to be a bit overexposed, thus making colours appear washed out. The level of detail captured, even when focusing on grass, is amazing considering this phone's entry-level status.. With no flash to help out at night, it seems that Nokia has developed a way to make low-light shots brighter. When taking photos, we were surprised by how they made rooms look lit up even when the only light was coming from outside. This comes at the cost of clarity and detail, and you'll notice a lot of noise and speckling when looking at these photos at 100 percent zoom.. Performance We were happy enough with the Lumia 525's performance when it came to navigating through the interface. The phone took a bit of time to load some apps, but things were otherwise smooth. We noticed some graphical glitches in Temple Run 2, which really shouldn't have put that much stress on the phone. With that in mind, it would seem that high-end games are totally out of the question.. Benchmark scores came in at roughly half as much as the Lumia 1320's, which in turn were roughly half as good as the Lumia 1520's. It's clear that you get what you pay for, and so Nokia's new entry-level Lumia remains exactly where the 520 was in terms of both performance and value. We'll have to wait for the next generation to see Nokia up the ante.. It should come as no surprise that the Lumia 525 struggled to play HD videos. Simple AVI files worked fine, but anything encoded at a heavy bit-rate should be avoided. The built-in speaker is loud enough, but sounds a bit hollow and tends to distort sound at if the volume is set higher than halfway up.. Our battery life loop test took 7 hours, 17 minutes to kill the Lumia 525 with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi switched off and the screen brightness set to Medium. That's a pretty decent figure, and you should be able to get through a full day of calls, texts, music and simple Web browsing.. Verdict The Lumia 525 is a small, affordable phone with a surprisingly decent camera and plenty of attitude, but not much else going for it. When held up to similarly priced Android phones, it's hard to make a case in favour of Windows Phone, which is why Nokia has capitalised on looks and ease of use.. If you're looking for the most powerful phone available for around Rs. You'd be better off with Lenovo's A706 , for example. However there is one very clear market for the Lumia 525: first-time smartphone users. If you're graduating from feature phone (Nokia or otherwise) and are looking for a phone that will let you browse the Web, take good photos and use Facebook or WhatsApp easily and in style, this phone is a pretty decent option..

I'll admit it right off the bat. I was wrong about the Body Glove Satin case for the Lumia 520. When I first saw the Body Glove Satin case in its packaging, I immediately thought that it would be a rubbery case that served little purpose, other than to render the sleek, pleasant-to-hold Lumia 520 bulky and difficult to use.

A second save slot in Metal Gear Survive costs $10. The Lumia 525: Design, Display, Video. Nokia has been especially successful with their entry-level range of Windows Phones, particularly the Lumia 520 , which on the back of its dirt-cheap price, quickly propelled itself to be the best-selling Windows Phone. A successor was always on the cards, but what Nokia has provided – the Lumia 525 – is a little unusual.. Nokia Lumia 525 - $160 (unlocked). 4.0”, 800 x 480 LCD display (233 ppi). 1.0 GHz dual-core CPU, Adreno 305 GPU, 1GB RAM. 8 internal storage, microSD card slot. 5 MP camera, 1/4” sensor, f/2.4 lens, 720p video. In nearly every way, the Lumia 525 is the same as the Lumia 520: same Snapdragon S4 SoC, same five megapixel rear camera, same 4.0-inch WVGA display, same storage options and the same design. Nokia has bumped up the RAM from 512 MB to 1 GB, allowing you to run more apps in the background, as well as the latest games. The software included is also the latest and greatest, for what it’s worth.. However, since the Lumia 520 launched at the start of 2013 the entry-level smartphone market has changed; new hardware has been unveiled specifically for budget devices, and older parts have become cheaper. The competition is also ferocious, specifically Motorola's aggressively-priced Moto G comes to mind.. How does the Lumia 525 fit into the equation in 2014?. The Nokia Lumia 525 used in this review was provided by Expansys. Check them out for unlocked, off-contract devices at great prices, with fast shipping around the globe.. If you were to put all of Nokia’s smartphones in a line-up, it’d be very difficult to pick apart the Lumia 520 and Lumia 525. In fact, it would be impossible, because the design of both phones is identical right down to the size and weight.. The front of the 525 is very rectangular, which suits the design language of Windows Phone 8 well. Display coverage of roughly 59% is mediocre, as can be appreciated by the large bezels around the four inch panel, but the display is positioned in the perfect position to make the phone easy to use. Below the display you’ll find the standard Windows Phone capacitive hardware buttons, and above is the in-call speaker and a few cleverly hidden sensors. You’ll note here there’s no front-facing camera.. While the front profile is rectangular, the edges of the Lumia 525 curve away significantly, making the handset fit well in the hand. The device is 11.2mm thick at its thickest point. There’s no mistaking that the 525 is a chubby phone, however at 124 grams it still retains a portable feel. Some of the thickness can be attributed to the removable back cover, which is made of thick, tough plastic in keeping with Nokia’s tradition of making ‘unbreakable’ devices.. The rear plastic cover on the white model is glossy, which I’m not particularly fond of. Luckily, the Lumia 525 also comes in black, red and yellow, which judging by the Lumia 520 will feature nicer matte plastic. The display is protected with glass; unfortunately not tough Gorilla Glass, but it should resist wear and tear.. The right-hand side of the Lumia 525 has all the hardware buttons in the usual Lumia configuration. At the top is the volume rocker, followed by the power button and the ever-useful two-stage camera button. The 525 isn’t the largest smartphone going around, and during my usage I found the power button to be a little bit low down for my liking, but it’s still easier to access than if it were along the top edge.. You’ll also find the microUSB port centered along the bottom edge, the 3.5mm audio jack offset along the top edge, the 5-megapixel camera in the top-center of the back panel, and a speaker grille towards the bottom. The speaker is quite weak and sometimes lacks the power necessary to be audible in loud environments, not to mention it’s terrible for music playback of any kind.. Taking off the Lumia 525’s back cover can be a challenge, but it does uncover the micro-SIM slot, microSD card slot, and – to the joy of many people – a removable, replaceable battery. The choice to include a removable battery does add flexibility to the 525, however with the trade-off that the battery itself will be smaller. AnandTech covers this well in one of their articles if you’re interested in further reading about the issue, and my thoughts are largely the same.. The budget-minded design of the Lumia 525 is fairly nice, and does the job without much fuss. Nokia has kept the 525 portable, usable and comfortable to hold, which is great even for a handset design that is now on its second generation.. The Nokia Lumia 525 packs the exact same display as the Lumia 520, meaning that we’re getting year-old budget-centric technology in what’s being marketed as a new device: a 4.0-inch IPS TFT LCD panel with a resolution of 800 x 480. Other affordable devices are now packing 720p displays, which makes the 525 seem a little substandard.. The display’s low resolution (233 pixels per inch) is noticeable from the moment you turn the device on. That’s not to say the panel itself is bad – text is more than readable – but it’s no challenge to spot individual pixels. The edges of text and graphics are noticeably jagged, and it lacks the clarity you’d get from a higher resolution.. Nokia's IPS LCD offers good color quality and images can look vibrant in the right conditions, despite noticeable backlight bleed that reduces the panel’s contrast ratio. In the settings you can change the display’s color profile, with sliders to adjust both temperature and saturation, although I tend to find the default settings to be the best.. One of the key aspects that makes the Lumia 525’s display module different from a high-end smartphone is that the touchscreen digitizer and LCD panel are two separate components. This is great for repairability, but increases the layers between the LCD crystals and the outside air, reducing viewing angles and outdoor visibility, making the display feel like it is set back somewhat from the glass.. That said, viewing angles are still quite good thanks to the display’s use of IPS technology. Outside readability is okay by default, with the display unit reflecting a fair bit of light, but this can be improved through enabling the screen readability enhancements in the settings. With this feature enabled, the contrast is boosted when the phone detects a bright environment, which makes it easier to see the display at the expense of accurate picture reproduction.. The Lumia 525’s display is very bright at the maximum brightness setting, which helps in strongly lit situations, and the lowest brightness is low enough not to hurt eyes in pitch black rooms. The automatic brightness setting worked well in adjusting the display brightness according to light level changes, though I found it to be slightly too dim when indoors.. Nokia hasn’t skimped on touchscreen-related features. Like all high-end Lumia devices, the Lumia 525 comes with a high sensitivity touchscreen mode (enabled by default), which allows you to use the display with gloves on. This setting will drain the battery faster when it’s on, as more power must be sent to the digitizer, but it can be very handy on those cold winter mornings that demand the use of gloves.. There’s also a setting that allows you to wake the handset by double-tapping on the touchscreen, which I found to work reasonably well. Unfortunately a feature which sees the time always displayed on the screen hasn’t made the cut to the Lumia 525, but this is likely for power consumption reasons..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars simply superb...!. prompt delivery, in perfect condition and the phone is amazing.. absolutely no lags, runs games very smoothly and the apps available are more than enough. Also, the camera is decent and the sound quality is not bad..! The overall build is solid and slim and the looks are stunning. in short, no regrets on purchasing this phone based on the performance and the things mentioned above. However, the screen, without a scratch gaurd(like mine, as i had also purchased a flip-flap cover with it), attracts way too many fingerprints. Even flies are not attracted to a ripe banana that much. It spoils visibility many times especially when u use ur phone in bright sunlight, eventhough the "sunlight readability" mode is switched on. This is where it loses a star... this phone is a good value for money and is among the best in windows phones available in the market. Also, the battery backup is pretty good... infact way better than most android xperia phones! Amazon's pricing is very good, when compared to other online megastores and the packing was decent.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars I earn it, possese it......... It' s great phone to hold in my hand..... I'm using it almost 17 days long... It's too early to give it a review but I can't hold my hand to write anything about it. It's a super smooth touch sensitive phone..... it can handle 720p video, running nice... After all using windows for almost 10 years it is good to use a win phone..... As I'm not a power user the battery running full 2days/48 hours after a full 100% charge.... and I have no hang issue with this like other operating system's phone have..... Disadvantage: some of option is not there like copying files, moving files from one location to another... camera features is great but the picture's quality some what fade.... color intensity, contrast is not good enough... And network catching power is not great. i think there have some issue which should Nokia took care about this phone... after all it's worth to buy in this range..... 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Much Better than 520. More smoothness more usability, although all configs are same except the RAM, still performance is much more improved. For those who blame the Windows Store check out once again, all necessary apps can be found. You will receive all updates from Microsoft as the OS part is directly controlled by Microsoft and is not dependent on the Handset Maker. If you are bored of using the same Android and want to change the flavor then can try this one.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars awesome phone. if u are going for windows platform then go for this...if not windows is...there are ample of choices ... But this phone is awesome at its price ..comparing it with all the windows phone in this price group u will find ... 1 extra feature in Lumia 525 E.g... Lumia 520 has 512 ram...525 has 1gb of ram Lumia 530 has 512 ram..no proximity sensors..no light sensons Lumia 525 has all these... Talking abt its ...performance ..trust me it will never let u down in front of ur friends... Starting wit music .....and ending to office use this phone will give ub100%... U can play high end games,u can enjoy a heart touching music..on headphones ...call quality is awesome..camera is awesome In dayblight ..a bit fussy in night ..but managable...sensors work smoothly..keyboard is user friendly and correct mistake ..as it make ur typing more fast...It catches voice commands easily..like call mama..call dady...open camera 📷. ..etc +point it works without internet as in android phone internet is req for this...friends its.... True windows has limited aap support but that's not big deal...u will be getting all important apps ...which will be required by u to do all ur works... So...i will suggest u to buy it .a game 🎮 changer from Nokia thanks.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Decent device!!!. Its good for starters and shallow gamers. You can use any app for about 15-20 min after that it starts heating. If you are using wifi or cellular net it works fine for first 10-15 min then the surfing and download speed reduces. Battery backup is not different from 520. If you use continuously it will last for 5-6 hrs. Earlier subway surfer used to lag on 520, in 525 it runs smooth. Maybe windows 8.1 update may change the interface and give new face to windows phone. Better go for higher end lumia devices rather than this one. All devices ending with -0 are 512 mb and those with -5 are 1 gb ram devices. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars A great buy !!!. I have always been using android phones esp samsung. i switched to a lumia wit half heart, but i must say i really made the rite choice. Pros: 1GB RAM does make playing games smoother n multi tasking better.. Offline maps come in handy camera apps provide a lot of options to click like a pro- like changing shutter speed, iso etc IPS LCD does give good viewing angles touch sensitivity is great. The build of the phone is pretty good and the lumia black has a matte finish back cover that makes it look really sleek Cons: No front facing camera- bt given that we rarely use a front facing camera, this could be ignored No camera flash Apps cant be installed on SD card so wit the inbuilt memory available (close to 5GB), we cant do much without using an SD card for storing media files. Not many apps are available on WP yet- but ya, soon they would be... Yet, for the price range, this phone definitely is a great choice. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars U have apps like metro file manager. After using this phone for about one yr, I would say to any of my friends never purchase a windows phone. Why? ....u don't have a proper file access system. So what? U have apps like metro file manager...i have used those apps, u won't know where your files are. I don't know where my files are which I received through bluetooth. U wont be able to attach any other file types other than picture in your email attachment directly. If u are ready for file access related frustrations the go ahead with your choice. I am switching back to Android. Bye windows, u r good only in PC's.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. I purchased this product but the phone is not working. Its switched off mode I kept it on charging but no progress. 1.0 out of 5 stars I think this is the bad service by Maheshwari and sons distributor. If you ready to compromise with android OS then it is the best smart phone I have ever in my life below 10000Rs. 5.0 out of 5 stars best of best. Does't crib even if you drop it once accidentally. 5.0 out of 5 stars very good. Does't crib even if you drop it once .... it is a good phone but i dont like it because of windows. 3.0 out of 5 stars Three Stars. Has overheating problem and like any other Lumia phone has screen that is ready to break on the first fall.. 4.0 out of 5 stars Has overheating problem and like any other Lumia phone has screen that is ready .... Device is bad but not windows8/10, It always had touch sencitive issue. 1.0 out of 5 stars One Star. 4.0 out of 5 stars Four Stars. I had been using this phone for the past two years.Even now I am using the same phone with no complaints. 4.0 out of 5 stars Good phone!!. 5.0 out of 5 stars best. Hello people, I dont really suggest this phone because it does not have a front camera,internal memory will be used by the os. 2.0 out of 5 stars its not worthy.

Nokia Lumia 525 Review : The Magic of 1GIG RAM that Delivers Performance. Devices Featured Lumia 525 Nokia Lumia 525 Review 2014-01-27. What is still missing in Lumia 525?. Flash unit for the rear camera. Should I buy Lumia 520 or Lumia 525?. Last year at the Mobile World Congress (MWC 2013), Nokia announced it’s first entry level Windows Phone 8 device, the Lumia 520. The Lumia 520 was released in many countries within a month and it went on to become the most selling Windows Phone ever. The phone had decent specs with good build quality and the fact that Windows Phone 8 runs smoothly on even 512MB RAM made it a big hit. But one of main issues with the device was that many popular games on the platform were available only for devices with 1GB and above RAM and hence users of Lumia 520 were not able to install such games.. To address this issue, Nokia announced the Lumia 525 in December and the only change with respect to Lumia 520 was the extra RAM. The design, the features and everything remains the same when compared to Lumia 520. We reviewed the Nokia Lumia 525 for its design, build, camera, performance and the battery life.. Here is the video review of Lumia 525, if you want the text version, read on.. The display on Lumia 525 is 4inch IPS + LCD and it is the same unit found on Lumia 520. The display is pretty good since it is IPS and the viewing angles are good. But since there is not clear black technology included (available on high end Lumia phones like Lumia 920, 1020, 1520 etc), the sunlight readability isn’t great when compared to other Lumia phones.. One of the main issues with the display is that it is a fingerprint magnet, so you might have to clean the display quite often.. When it comes to phone made by Nokia, one thing is good for sure and that is build quality. Lumia 525 has pretty good quality for its price. The device comes in various colors (Black, While, Yellow and Orange) and has interchangeable back covers with removable battery. The back cover is pretty decent quality, although not high standard materials like the Lumia 920 or 1020 and has a glossy finish.. Overall, when you hold the device in hand, it does give a good feel with good build quality and finish.. Here is the unboxing video of Lumia 525.. Nokia Lumia 525 comes with Windows Phone 8 OS and it includes the recently announced Lumia Black Update from Nokia. We all know that Windows Phones are optimized for even 512MB RAM, so you won’t find any performance issues with the OS running with a dual core processor and 1GB RAM. Even if you were to install tons of apps, there isn’t any lag or issues with the device. The Black Update brings in new features like double tap to wake the phone, App folders, Nokia Beamer and more to the phone.. Here are the benchmark scores for the device.. The call quality was really good on the device and there was no dropping of calls even when the network strength wasn’t full. The music quality and the speakers are good and should be more than enough for a normal user. The quality of earphones, although build wise it is pretty good, usage wise it might cause pain in your ears with prolonged usage. There is no earphones with buds like the ones you find on Lumia 920, 1020 or 925.. One of the main disappointing factors is the lack of a front facing camera. When video calling and Skype are getting popularity all over the world, the lack of front camera could be a deal breaker for many users.. With Lumia 525, Nokia has addressed one of the main issues faced by Lumia 520 users, the availability of 1GB RAM. This allows users to install and play any game or app currently available for the Windows Phone platform. So you can play your favorite game, be it Subway Surfers, Temple Run 2 or Asphalt 8 Airbone on Lumia 525.. While the performance was good, it wasn’t as smooth as you would find on a Lumia 920 or a 1020, but it was much better than a similar priced Android phone. Here is a quick look at the gaming performance.. Camera on Lumia 525 is a 5.0 MP autofocus unit, but does not come with a flash included and it is similar to Lumia 520. Since the phone does not come with a flash, forget about taking photos in low light or during night. The phone produces decent shots in the daylight, but the color reproduction isn’t that great. We tried the camera in different conditions, low light, daylight, close ups, backlight etc. Overall, we would say that the camera is good only for daylight photography, but there is definitely improvement over Lumia 520 because of the Black update.. The phone is also capable of recording videos at 720p and here again it produces decent quality videos in daylight, but does not come with any Optical Image Stabilization.. The battery on Lumia 525 is the same unit as that of Lumia 520 which is at 1430mAh. Although when you compare with similar priced Android phone, you might see that the average battery on these devices are in 1700-1800mAh range, the battery on Lumia 525 is pretty good. With casual gaming, using 3G, calling, listening to music and some browsing, it lasted for a day. Even if you are a heavy user, you will still be able to get 8-10 hours of battery life from this phone.. Windows Phone 8 is pretty good with battery life when compared to Android and this really comes as an advantage for Lumia 525 even though it is equipped with smaller battery.. Even though Nokia addressed the concern with 512MB RAM on Lumia 520 with a 1GB RAM on this device, there are still many areas where Nokia needs to improve. This is the bigger question than whether you should buy the Lumia 525 or not. Lumia 520 and Lumia 525 has just one difference and that is the RAM and this helps in installing any app or game available on Windows Phone store. If you want to play all the games and install all apps available on the store, then Lumia 525 is the choice. But if do not car much about gaming, then Lumia 520 makes a better choice and value for money as there is a clear 3k INR difference between the two phones.. Lumia 520 will get all the new features on Lumia 525 with the Lumia Black update which will be arriving soon. Overall, we feel Nokia Lumia 525 is a good phone, but Lumia 520 makes a better value for money phone if you are bothered about gaming.. WPXBOX's Verdict Design and Build - 7/10 Display - 6/10 Camera - 8/10 Performance - 9/10 Battery - 8/10 Music and Speakers - 7/10 Gaming - 9/10 Value for Money - 9/10.

Nokia Lumia 520 Vs Nokia Lumia 525: A Comparison. Let's take a look at some of the specifications of both Lumia 520 and Lumia 525 to see the similarities and differences.. Updated: Jan 09, 2014, 12:48 PM IST. Following the success of its Windows phones, Finnish phone maker Nokia has launched the much awaited Lumia 525 and 1320 (phablet) at a competitive price of Rs 10,399 and Rs 23,999, respectively.. The smartphone market is abuzz as to whether these two will live up to the expectations.. However, what has drawn more eyeballs is the likeliness, similarities and differences between the siblings - Lumia 520 and 525, the latter being regarded by the company as an improvement from its initial offering.. Let's take a look at some of the specifications of both Lumia 520 and Lumia 525 to see the similarities and differences.. In terms of display, the siblings feature a 4-inch IPS LCD (480x800 pixels) with 233 ppi pixel density and a scratch-resistant glass. Moreover, they have the same dimensions of 119.9 x 64 x 9.9 mm, 75.7 cc (4.72 x 2.52 x 0.39 in) and both weigh 124 gms each. This means, there are no winners and losers in this section.. Again, no winner or loser here as the two siblings feature the same processor - 1GHz dual-core, Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor.. Microsoft's operating system Windows Phone 8 saw success with the Lumia series, especially with its budget smartphone Lumia 520. To continue the forward march, Nokia has come up with the latest Lumia 525.. 5MP back camera with Nokia Smart Camera Cinemagraph lens, Panorama lens, Bing vision - features that both the Lumia 520 and Lumia 525 possess. What is perhaps missing is a front camera which the Finnish phone maker could have added to 525 which was missing in the 520 as well. However, the back camera can record a high definition video of 720p at 30fps.. Well! This is where the difference comes. While the Lumia 520 features 512MB RAM, Lumia 525 features 1GB RAM which, in ways, would surely make the system faster and one could work on more apps at a time. Amazing, considering that these are budget smartphones. Besides, these are expandable to 64GB via microSD card. However, Microsoft is offering 20GB of free SkyDrive storage for all Lumia series phones bought before January 31.. Now, that sure is a piece of news.. Once again, this is one section where many customers decide on smartphones and the Lumia phobes are ones that usually live up to their expectations. While the Lumia 520 with a Li-Ion 1430 mAh battery gives a talktime of almost 15 hours on 2G and about 10 hours on 3G, the Lumia 525 with a 1430 mAh battery gives 17 hours talktime on 2G and about 11 hours on 3G.. Lumia 520 supports upto 60 hours of continuous music play while Lumia 525 supports about 48 hours of continuous music play.. Nokia Lumia 520 was hailed as the most affordable Windows Phone with a price tag of about Rs 10,000 on its launch and went on to win the market. Today, it is available for as low as Rs 8,400 much to the delight of the fans.. Keeping up with the competition, Nokia Lumia 525 is competitively priced at Rs 10,399 considering its excellent features.. However, at the end of the day, it is hard to draw which of the above two is a better Windows Phone of the Nokia Lumia series. While Lumia 520 has proved itself in the market (it is the most popular Windows Phone), Lumia 525 has just arrived and one has to see the verdict of the critics and fans..

We just unboxed the brand new Nokia Lumia 525 in white and found it look very slightly different from the Lumia 520. While we are still reviewing the device, we thought it would be a fine idea to show you the phone in pictures, so that one can get to know how exactly the phone looks like, in real pictures, rather than renders or the usual promotional material. With white glossy plastic on the back, the Lumia 525 sports a slightly sleeker design and looks great, like most Lumia devices usually do. So here’s a quick run down of the hardware through our photos.. The front of the phone sports the 4 inch WVGA IPS display, and from what we know after using it for a while, it seems to be exactly the same as the Lumia 520. The colour of the phone nicely comes up to the front, giving the glass a nice thin border.. Just above the display we have the Nokia logo and the ear piece just in the seams between the frame and the glass. We would have liked a front facing camera here, but considering this is just a quick SKU change, we shall wait for the true successor.. Below the display we have the capacitive shortcuts for Start, Bing and back. They provide haptic feedback but they don’t have a backlight, which is a bummer as well as a winner. Bummer because sometimes you need it in the dark, but winner because it doesn’t light up in the dark when watching videos or playing games.. While the left side is left empty, devoid of any controls or I/Os, we have the standard volume rocker, power/lock switch and camera shutter combo on the right. The buttons are made of plastic, and our unit has a wonky camera shutter button. We will see if our experience changes over the course of our review.. Over at the top we have the 3.5mm audio jack. We couldn’t find a secondary microphone anywhere, so you can rule stereo recording out.. Over at the bottom, we have the micro USB port and that alone. The primary microphone is hidden in the seams between the glass and the frame, just like the ear piece.. The back of the Lumia 525 is where the small design change is. Without the sharper curves, the device looks and feels sleeker.. The 5 MP camera sits on the back, without the company of a LED flash and has the Nokia logo right below.. The loudspeaker is located at the bottom right and obviously, due to the position, it gets muffled when the phone is kept on a soft surface.. The subtle design change Nokia did with the Lumia 525 is very visible in this picture. Look at the gently curved corner, which used to be sharper on the 520.. The replaceable battery unit of the Lumia 525 is a 1430 mAH Nokia BL-5j. And here’s the phone without the back door –. Underneath the back cover we have the micro SIM and micro SD card slots for single SIM connectivity and storage expansion up to 64 GB.. The phone runs on the Windows Phone 8 operating system with GDR3 + Lumia Black update out of the box. The phone doesn’t have all the enhancements though, like for example, there is no Glance Screen on the Lumia 525, but it does have the super sensitive touch screen and now thanks to the 1 GB of RAM, all the apps and games can technically run on the device.. So that concludes our tour of the Nokia Lumia 525’s hardware and a little bit of software info. We are working on the review to bring you what ever we know about the device, so stay tuned for that in the coming days! Meanwhile, let us know if you have any questions about the device in the comments section below and we will do our best to answer your queries, cheers!.
