Released in September 2014, the Apple iPhone 6 changed the face of the smartphone industry. It was an update to a larger form factor of 5.44 x 2.64 x 0.27 inches compared to the iPhone 5s , thanks mainly to an increase in screen size from 4-inches to 4.7-inches. This exciting new iteration in phone design laid the groundwork for the iPhone 6s , and represented an improvement in almost every way over its predecessor. While newer models have superseded the specifications of the 6s, it remains an excellent phone, and it is still readily available in new and used condition from sellers on eBay.. The iPhone 6 is a sleek, stylish phone with a 4-7-inch, multitouch, backlit LCD, a power-efficient A8 processor, and 1GB of RAM. It has a non-removable Li-Po 1810 mAh battery, providing 14 hours of talk time, 10 hours of Internet usage, and up to 250 hours of standby time. The rear camera is 8 MP, while the front-facing "selfie" camera is 1.2 MP.. The iPhone 6 is available in silver , gold , and space gray , but there are many covers and slipcases available on eBay that allow you to add a touch of vibrancy and personality. The basic model offers 16GB of storage, but for music and movie lovers, there is a 64GB option. If you want to make sure you always have space for the latest app or that cool new song you just heard, there is also a 128GB option, which is enough storage for over 30,000 songs.. Sellers on eBay have a massive choice but to get an even better deal, look for used or refurbished models. These may be as good as new, but have a much lower selling price. Shopping for refurbished models is a perfect way to own a classic phone without blowing the budget.. The inventory of Apple iPhones on eBay is huge, ranging from the latest models to classic handsets that are no longer in production. Many of the phones are unlocked, meaning you are free to use them on any network. With so many competitively priced handsets available, it's never been easier to find the perfect phone for your budget and requirements.. The long-anticipated iPhone 8 series is in the works, meaning a huge increase from the power and specs from the 6 series. With an energy-saving OLED screen the new series of iPhones will have a longer battery life and a much faster processor than previous models. There’s also rumors of wireless charging and a facial recognition feature built right into the new Apple line of iPhones. Should you trade up to the newest additions to the Apple smartphone family? The choice is yours, but an iPhone 8 would nearly be futureproof—meaning your iPhone will last for longer and be able to work the new iOS operating system without hassle—not to mention fast and good looking.. Still looking for the perfect iPhone for you? Check out the popular iPhone 7 , the 7 Plus , or any of Apple’s previous models like the iPhone 4 , 5 , 5c , 5s , SE , 6 Plus , 6s , or the 6s Plus ..

One of the differentiating features of the iPhone is its overall experience, which for the first time is available on a device with a larger screen size.

It surprised me with its superior performance over Samsung Galaxy S3 ( though new versions launched by Samsung are much better). Especially battery life which can go on till the next day even when at 10 %. Phone performance, Camera quality, ease of use are some features that i would ask people to go for this phone.I rarely notice any sluggishness in Phone's performance even after a year now.. I would say "Go for it" if price doesn't take the front seat for you and quality does.. Was this review helpful?

Expert Review User reviews. iPhone 6: 1334 x 750 with 326 pixels per inch. iPhone 6+: 1920 x 1080 with 401 pixels per inch. The iPhone 6, one of the most popular tech releases of the year (as iPhones always are) is finally among us. The iPhone 6 has come with some serious changes this time around, similar to the iPhone 4 release that was much differentiated from its predecessor. If people were bummed out or let down by the release of the iPhone 5, they should be pleasantly surprised by what the iPhone 6 has brought to the table. is it worth the price? Read on to find out!. The Apple iPhone 6 comes in three elegant colors: gold, silver, and space gray. There's no denying that the phones certainly look fantastically sleek. New to this model are the rounded edges that replace the previous sharp-edged rectangle look everyone is so used to. Some people believe this makes the phone more slippery and easy to drop, but that may be offset by the more durable screen that isn't so prone to cracks as previous models. The screen is supposed to be made of sapphire, but tests have shown that it probably isn't pure sapphire like the home button, but it is definitely stronger than the 5s screen.. The iPhone 6 is likely to make anyone who holds it fall in love. If one is an Apple hater, he or she should avoid picking up an iPhone 6. They will fall in love—fair warning to all. The metallic shell is akin to the iPad air, making it feel very comfortable in the hand. For those who put great design at the top of their list for desired qualities, this phone will make them spend their money.. The phone is also thinner than ever before, however, the camera protrudes a little bit out of the back of the phone, which could cause rocking when set down on a table. Although it feels thin, it doesn't have such a lightweight and empty feeling reminiscent of the iPhone 5s.. The iPhone 6 comes in two forms, the regular iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 plus. The regular 6 comes with a larger screen than previous models at 4.7 inches. The 6 Plus steps it up a notch (or 2) by boasting a 5.5 inch screen that rivals many of the large-screen Android phones. Those who had a harder time precisely pecking away at the small-lettered keyboards should be delighted with these new screen sizes. Apple must have smartly realized they were losing market share to the companies offering larger screens. Apple also added a Retina HD display to both models of the phone, effectively boosting image quality.. The resolutions for each are as follows:. The Retina HD display allows loyal Apple fanatics to experience a higher level of contrast, enhanced wide angle viewing, and improved polarization. The high level of contrast is produced by UV light aligning the liquid crystals exactly where they should be, providing a much-improved look with deep blacks and sharp text. Wide-angle viewing ensures everyone around has just as great a view as the person holding the phone. The Retina HD display utilizes dual-domain pixels that provide great color accuracy all the way across the phone, allowing movies and pictures to look as sharp as possible. The improved polarizer was designed for all of the vitamin D addicts out there as the Retina HD display provides a clearer view for those out in the sun wearing sunglasses.. Simply put, the user has the ability to see more and do more on the larger screen and Retina HD display.. Another feature is the ability to toggle between standard view or zoom view. If one has clunky and clumsy fingers, they might opt for the zoom view due to the larger icons for the apps; however, they would be sacrificing a little bit of their app viewing options as fewer can fit on the screen while in zoom view.. With the larger screen, a user can landscape view like never before. Some apps have new designs that take on a new structure in landscape mode that is different from what people may be used to in previous iPhone models.. No more black bars! The black bars have been eliminated as the iPhone 6 scales all apps to its resolution. All old apps will look just fine on an iPhone 6, but developers may want to re-design apps to be more aesthetically pleasing on the larger screens.. 8 has some great new features for this generation of iPhones. One feature is 'QuickType,' which accurately predicts what a person is going to type before they finish typing it, similar to Android phones. Spotlight search functionalities have also been expanded to include things like news, the App Store, and the web. 8 also has an improved notification system that provides convenient ways to respond to any notifications a person receives. The notification center can be a bit more difficult to pull down for those with smaller hands, but it's definitely worth the convenience of the new notification features.. The Apple A8 processor is capable of a 50% power reduction, but the difference will likely only be noticed by the most active phone users. The A8 is about 25% faster than the A7 born before it, allowing for quicker task switching, and the A8 also has a 50% faster graphics chip.. Along with the A8 comes the M8 co-processor. The M8 is responsible for detecting motion and is a step up from the M7 in the 5s. The M8 is capable of distinguishing between movements such as biking or running, and it can also act as a barometer. The M8 can track how many steps have been taken or how much elevation has been scaled in general.. The iPhone 6 offers 14 hours of talk time, which is 40% more than the 5s. However, the web browsing time on 3G and LTE still stands at 10 hours, and the video playback time has only increased 1 hour from the 5s, now standing at 11 hours.. The camera still has the 8MP lens, and as previously stated, the lens sticks out a bit from the back of the phone; however, this shouldn't be a problem with the sapphire glass protecting the lens.. The camera allows for super smooth shots and fast auto-focus due to the 'Focus Pixels' sensor that detects light very quickly. Image stabilization is improved, allowing the videographer to create smoother video while moving about. The iPhone 6 Plus actually has a feature called 'Optical Image Stabilization' which utilizes a gyroscope to compensate for hand movement.. A brand new video encoder allows video of 1080p at 60fps and slow-motion video of a staggering 240fps that is perfect for viewing every ripple of action. The camera also now has built-in time lapse capability.. It might finally be time for mobile payments to start taking off. Apple Pay on the iPhone 6 is very convenient, processing transactions almost hassle-free in seconds. All one has to do is select their card from their passbook, hold the phone up to the payment terminal, and use touchID to verify their fingerprint, and voila! Done!. The advantages of using Apple Pay are that it's quicker, multiple cards can be held, and the transactions are processed in a way that masks credit card numbers, providing further protection.. Online payment is pretty easy as well—similar to PayPal, except the user can choose to use TouchID to scan for fingerprint instead of entering a password.. This is a great feature for those who tend to forget their wallet because let's face it, nobody forgets to bring their phone anywhere these days. Right now Apple Pay is only available in the US. Apple has partnered with Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and multiple issuing banks, and Apply Pay will be available in 220,000 stores in the US that are already capable of handling mobile transactions with the NFC's short range wireless capabilities.. Some are calling the iPhone 6 the best phone to ever hit the market, and for good reason. This phone is sleek and has a beautiful design and look to it. It just symbolizes supreme quality as it sits in the hands and demands attention. The larger screen and improved features make the iPhone 6 one of the hottest, if not the hottest phone out on the market. So, is the phone worth it's price? Simply put, YES!.

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The devices are part of the iPhone series and were announced on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014. [17] The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly serve as successors to the iPhone 5S and were themselves replaced as flagship devices of the iPhone series by the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus on September 9, 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus include larger 4.7 and 5.5 inches (120 and 140. mm) displays, a faster processor, upgraded cameras, improved LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity and support for a near field communications -based mobile payments offering. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus received positive reviews, with critics regarding their improved design, specifications, camera, and battery life as being improvements over previous iPhone models. However, aspects of the design of iPhone 6 were also panned, including plastic strips on the rear of the device for its antenna that disrupted the otherwise metal exterior, and the screen resolution of the standard-sized iPhone 6 being lower than other devices in its class. Pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded four million within its first 24 hours of availability—an Apple record. [20] More than ten million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were sold in the first three days, another Apple record. [21] During its lifespan, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sold 220 million in total, making them the best selling iPhone models, so far, and one of the most successful phones to date .. Despite their positive reception, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been the subject of several hardware issues, including most prominently, being susceptible to bending under pressure (a design flaw nicknamed "Bendgate"), and as a byproduct of this lack of rigidity, the touchscreen's internal hardware being susceptible to losing its connection to the phone's logic board (nicknamed "Touch Disease"). The iPhone 6 Plus was also the subject of camera issues, including some devices with malfunctioning optical image stabilization or otherwise defects on rear cameras.. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the midrange spot in Apple's iPhone lineup when the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were released in September 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were discontinued in most countries on September 7, 2016 when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Their spot as the entry-level iPhone was replaced by the iPhone SE , which was released earlier on March 31, 2016. The iPhone 6 was relaunched with 32. GB of storage in Asian markets in February 2017 as a midrange/budget iPhone. It was later expanded to Europe, [3] [22] before hitting the US markets in May 2017, [23] and Canada in July 2017. 4.3 Flash storage performance. 4.4 iPhone 6 Plus camera issues. 6 Timeline of models. From the launch of the original iPhone to the iPhone 4S , iPhones used 3.5-inch displays—which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested that Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. [25] [26] [27] Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated that Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications —a technology that has been incorporated into many Android phones, but has experienced a low adoption rate among users. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were officially unveiled during a press event at the Flint Center for Performing Arts in Cupertino, California on September 9, 2014 and released on September 19, 2014; pre-orders began on September 12, 2014, with the iPhone 6 starting at US$649 and the iPhone 6 Plus starting at US$749. [29] In China, where the iPhone 5c and 5s were the first models in the iPhone series to be released in the country on the same day as their international launch, Apple notified local wireless carriers that it would be unable to release the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on the 19th because there were "details which are not ready"; local media reported that the devices had not yet been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology , and earlier in the year, a news report by state broadcaster China Central Television alleged that iPhone devices were a threat to national security because iOS 7's "frequent locations" function could expose "state secrets." [30] [31]. In August 2015, Apple admitted that some iPhone 6 Plus may have faulty cameras that could be causing photos to look blurry and initiated a replacement program. On September 9, 2015, with the release of the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the mid-range of the iPhone lineup. GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones, but the 16. GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in silver and space gray remain available for sale at a reduced price. In June 2016, Apple faced a potential sales ban in China, as Shenzhen Baili, a Chinese device maker, alleged that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on its design patent. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were discontinued on September 7, 2016, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus's spot as the entry-level iPhone has since been taken by the iPhone SE. As the iPhone SE has more powerful internal hardware than the midrange iPhone 6 (largely the same as the 6S) and had been released earlier on March 31, 2016, this created an unusual situation when it was sold alongside the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus until September 7 despite being marketed as a lower-tier iPhone.. In February 2017, the iPhone 6 was quietly relaunched in carrier stores and online, this time the storage has been changed to 32. In India it was sold on Amazon's website in Space Grey. In Taiwan, it was sold through Taiwan Mobile on March 10 in gold colour. In mid-March, it was released in the EU to Belarus via the i-Store web shop. It also makes an appearance in North America with Sprint based US prepaid carriers Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile , along with AT&T GoPhone. These are not being distributed by Apple on their website or their retail stores.. The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is influenced by that of the iPad Air with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display, and an aluminum rear that contains two plastic strips for the antenna. [37] Both models come in gold, silver, and "space gray" finishes. The iPhone 6 has a thickness of 6.9 millimetres (0.27. in), while the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1. in) in thickness; both are thinner than the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, with the iPhone 6 being Apple's thinnest phone to date. The most significant changes to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are its displays; both branded as " Retina HD Display " and "ion-strengthened", the iPhone 6 display is 4.7 inches in size with a 16:9 resolution of 1334x750 (326. ppi , minus one row of pixels), while the iPhone 6 Plus includes a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 ( 1080p ) display (401. The displays use a multiple-domain LCD panel, dubbed "dual-domain pixels"; the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in pattern, so that every pixel is seen from a different angle. This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display. To accommodate the larger physical size of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the power button was moved to the side of the phone instead of the top to improve its accessibility. [18] [19] The iPhone 6 features a 6.91. mAh) battery, while the iPhone 6 Plus features an 11.1. Unlike the previous model, the rear-facing camera is not flush with the rear of the device, but instead protrudes slightly. Both models include an Apple A8 system-on-chip , and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary difference between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is that the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller touted that the A8 chip would provide, in comparison to the 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early hands-on reports suggested that the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s. The expanded LTE connectivity on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is improved to LTE Advanced , with support for over 20 LTE bands (7 more than the iPhone 5s ), [41] for up to 150. Mbit/s download speed, and VoLTE support. Wi-Fi performance has been improved with support for 802.11ac specifications, providing speeds up to 433.0581. Mbit/s—which is up to 3 times faster than 802.11n , [41] along with Wi-Fi Calling support where available. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus add support for near-field communications (NFC). It is initially used exclusively for Apple Pay —a new mobile payments system which allows users to store their credit cards in Passbook for use with online payments and retail purchases over NFC. [42] [43] iOS 11 will provide support for uses of near-field communications besides Apple Pay. The iPhone 6's rear-facing camera now has the ability to shoot 1080p video at either 30 or 60 frames per second and slow-motion video at either 120 or 240 frames per second. The camera also includes phase detection autofocus. [45] It can also record. The iPhone 6 Plus camera is nearly identical, but also includes optical image stabilization. [18] [19] The front-facing camera was also updated with a new sensor and f/2.2 aperture, along with support for burst and HDR modes. See also: iOS version history , iOS 8 , iOS 9 , iOS 10 , and iOS 11. When first released, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were supplied pre-loaded with iOS 8 , while the iPhone 5S was supplied pre-loaded with iOS 7. Apps are able to take advantage of the increased screen size in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to display more information on-screen; for example, the Mail app uses a dual-pane layout similar to its iPad version when the device is in landscape mode on the iPhone 6 Plus. As it uses an identical aspect ratio, apps designed for the iPhone 5 , iPhone 5C, and 5S can be upscaled for use on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. To improve the usability of the devices' larger screens, an additional "Reachability" gesture was added; double-tapping the Home button will slide the top half of the screen's contents down to the bottom half of the screen. This function allows users to reach buttons located near the top of the screen, such as a "Back" button in the top-left corner. Both iPhone 6 models received generally positive reviews. Re/code called it "the best smartphone you can buy". [46] TechRadar praised the iPhone 6's "brilliant" design, improved battery life over the 5s, iOS 8 for being "smarter and more intuitive than ever", along with the quality of its camera. However, the plastic antenna strips on the rear of the phone were criticized for resulting in poor aesthetics, the display for having lower resolution and pixel density in comparison to other recent smartphones – including those with the same physical screen size as the iPhone 6, such as the HTC One , and for not having a sufficient justification for its significantly higher price in comparison to similar devices running Android or Windows Phone. [47] The Verge considered the iPhone 6 to be "simply and cleanly designed" in comparison to the 5s, noting that the phone still felt usable despite its larger size, but criticized the antenna plastic, the protruding camera lens (which prevents the device from sitting flat without a case), and the lack of additional optimization in the operating system for the bigger screen. Improvements such as performance, battery life, VoLTE support, and other tweaks were also noted. In conclusion, the iPhone 6 was considered "good, even great, but there’s little about it that’s truly ambitious or truly moving the needle. It’s just a refinement of a lot of existing ideas into a much more pleasant package". In regards to the 6 Plus, Engadget panned its design for being uncomfortable to hold and harder to grip in comparison to other devices such as the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G3 , but praised its inclusion of optical image stabilization and slightly better battery life than the 6. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were affected by a number of notable hardware-related issues, including but not limited to concerns surrounding their rigidity (which led to incidents surrounding chassis bending, as well as degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality), performance issues on models with larger storage capacity, camera problems on the 6 Plus model, as well as an initially undocumented "error 53" that appeared under certain circumstances.. Shortly after its public release, it was reported that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus chassis was susceptible to bending under pressure, such as when carried tightly in a user's pocket. While such issues are not exclusive to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the design flaw came to be known among users and the media as " Bendgate ". Apple responded to the bending allegations, stating that they had only received nine complaints of bent devices, and that the damage occurring due to regular use is "extremely rare." The company maintained that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus went through durability testing to ensure they would stand up to daily use. [50] The company offered to replace phones that were bent, if it is determined that the bending was unintentional. On October 1, 2014, it was reported by Axel Telzerow, editor-in-chief of the German technology magazine Computer Bild , that following the posting of a video where a presenter was able to bend an iPhone 6 Plus, an Apple Germany representative informed the publication that it had been banned from future Apple events and that it would no longer receive devices directly from Apple for testing. Telzerow responded by saying that "we congratulate you to your fine new generation of iPhones, even if one of them has a minor weakness with its casing. But we are deeply disappointed about the lack of respect of your company." [51]. On October 3, 2014 9to5Mac released a post claiming that certain iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users complained on social networking sites that the phone ripped off their hair when they held the phone close to their ears when making phone calls. [52] Twitter users claimed that the seam between the glass screen and aluminum back of the iPhone 6 is to blame, with hair becoming caught within it. Some users reported that 64 and 128. GB iPhone 6 models had experienced performance issues, and that some 128. GB iPhone 6 Plus models would, in rare cases, randomly crash and reboot. Business Korea reported that the issues were connected to the triple-layer cell NAND storage of the affected models. Triple-layer cells can store three bits of data per cell of flash, and are cheaper than dual-layer cell solutions, but at the cost of performance. It was reported that Apple had planned to switch the affected model lines back to multi-layer cell flash, and address the performance issues on existing devices in a future iOS update. It was reported that the optical image stabilization systems on some iPhone 6 Plus models were faulty, failing to properly stabilize when the phone is being held perfectly still, leading to blurry photos and "wavy"-looking videos. [58] The optical image stabilization system was also found to have been affected by accessories that use magnets, such as third-party lens attachments; Apple issued advisories to users and its licensed accessory makers, warning that magnetic or metallic accessories can cause the OIS to malfunction. On August 21, 2015, Apple instituted a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models released between September 2014 and January 2015, citing that faulty rear cameras on affected models may produce blurry pictures. Some iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models have an issue where the front facing camera is somehow "shifted", or out of place. Apple stated that they would replace most affected iPhone 6 models with this issue, free of charge. Despite numerous complaints regarding this issue, it does not seem to actually affect the camera itself. It is said that the camera is not what has shifted, but a piece of protective foam around the camera module itself that has gone out of place. If the iPhone 6 home button is repaired or modified by a third-party, the device will fail security checks related to Touch ID as the components had not been "re-validated" for security reasons—a process which can only be performed by an authorized Apple outlet. Failing these checks disables all features related to Touch ID. Such effects have sometimes happened as a result of damage as well. It was reported these same hardware integrity checks would trigger an unrecoverable loop into "Recovery Mode" if iOS is updated or restored, with attempts to restore the device via iTunes software resulting in an "error 53" message. Beyond the explanation that this is related to hardware integrity errors regarding Touch ID components, Apple provided no official explanation of what specifically triggers error 53 or how it can be fixed without replacing the entire device. On February 18, 2016, Apple released an iOS 9.2.1 patch through iTunes which addresses this issue, and admitted that error 53 was actually related to a diagnostic check for inspecting the Touch ID hardware before an iPhone is shipped from its factories. Touchscreen control components on iPhone 6 logic boards have insufficient support, including a lack of underfill—which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits , and a lack of rigid metal shielding on the logic board unlike previous iPhone models; the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible "sticker". Normal use of the device can cause the logic board to flex internally, which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality. A symptom that has been associated with this type of failure is a flickering grey bar near the top of the display. [64] [65] iFixit reported that this issue, nicknamed " touch disease ", [64] [66] [67] was a byproduct of the previous "Bendgate" design flaw because of the device's demonstrated lack of rigidity. As such, the larger iPhone 6 Plus is more susceptible to the flaw, but it has also been reported on a small percentage of iPhone 6 models. [67] [68] [69] The devices' successor, the iPhone 6S , is not afflicted by this flaw due to changes to their internal design, which included the strengthening of "key points" in the rear casing, and the re-location of the touchscreen controllers to the display assembly from the logic board. Initially, Apple did not officially acknowledge this issue. The issue was widely discussed on Apple's support forum—where posts discussing the issue have been subject to censorship. [65] The touchscreen can be repaired via microsoldering : Apple Stores are not equipped with the tools needed to perform the logic board repair, which had led to affected users sending their devices to unofficial, third-party repair services. An Apple Store employee interviewed by Apple Insider reported that six months after they first started noticing the problem, Apple had issued guidance instructing them to tell affected users that this was a hardware issue which could not be repaired, and that their iPhone had to be replaced. However, some in-stock units have also been afflicted with this issue out of the box, leading to an employee stating that they were "tired of pulling service stock out of the box, and seeing the exact same problem that the customer has on the replacement". [69] [70] The issue received mainstream attention in August 2016 when it was reported upon by iFixit. [64] [67] [69] On August 26, 2016, Apple Insider reported that based on data from four "high-traffic" Apple Store locations, there was a spike in the number of iPhone 6 devices brought into them for repairs following mainstream reports of the "touch disease" problem. On August 30, 2016, a group of three iPhone 6 owners sued Apple Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and filed for a proposed class action lawsuit , alleging that Apple was engaging in unfair business practices by having "long been aware" of the defective design, yet actively refusing to acknowledge or repair it. On November 17, 2016, Apple officially acknowledged the issue and announced a paid repair program for affected iPhone 6 Plus models, stating that "some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device". announced that, within 24 hours of availability, over 4 million pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were made, exceeding the supply available. [74] More than 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were sold in the first three days.
