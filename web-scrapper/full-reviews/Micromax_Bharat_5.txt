Micromax Bharat 5 is ideal for casual users looking for a smartphone that lasts longer. If you are looking for better user experience, Xiaomi Redmi 5A is a better bet. Last Published: Tue, Dec 12 2017. Micromax Bharat 5 is priced at Rs5,555 and is the company’s answer to Chinese rival Xiaomi and its recently launched Redmi 5A which starts at Rs5,999.. Micromax has intensified its focus on entry-level budget smartphones with new launches in Bharat series. After the Bharat 2 Ultra (Rs2,899), which was launched to take on the Reliance JioPhone,the Indian phone maker now has a superior smartphone, called Bharat 5. It is priced at Rs5,555 and is Micromax’s answer to Chinese rival Xiaomi and its recently launched Redmi 5A (which starts at Rs5,999).. Here are the five reason why you should buy the Bharat 5 and five reasons to look past it.. Micromax Bharat 5 comes with a 5.2-inch screen with a healthy resolution of 1,280x720p.Most smartphones selling at this price have a resolution of 800x480 or 960x540p at most. The text looks crisp, viewing angles are good, but colours look slightly washed out in comparison to the Redmi 5A’s 5-inch (1,280x720p) screen.. The text looks crisp and viewing angles are good.. Bharat 2 runs Android 7.0 with Micromax’s custom UI, which looks quite polished and offers more customisation options and features to play around with. One can apply themes, record calls from the calling app, lock apps to the home screen to prevent accidental changes and check out latest news and access favourite apps in the aggregator page on the homescreen.. harat 2 runs Android 7.0 with Micromax’s custom UI, which looks quite polished.. Storage space has been taken care of in Bharat 5. It offers 16GB internal storage and up to 64GB of expandable storage using a microSD card. Redmi 5A has 16GB internal storage too but it accepts microSD cards of up to 256GB. However, casual users are more likely to go for 64GB of expandable storage at most.. What gives the Bharat 5 an edge over rivals, including the Redmi 5A, is the big 5,000mAh battery. It can muster about two days of backup on a single charge which makes it ideal for users who travel a lot.. With 4G available at shoestring prices, users would be looking for smartphones that can take advantage of it. Bharat 5 impresses in that regard. It has a 4G SIM which supports VOLTE calling too, allowing users to make high-definition VOIP calls.. For users who prefer using both SIM cards, the Bharat 5’s hybrid SIM tray is a bit restricting. It allows them to access only one SIM or the microSD or just two SIM cards at a time. The Redmi 5A is better placed with a dedicated microSD slot, which is built separately from the two SIM slots.. Driving the Bharat 5 is a modest 1.3GHz MediaTek MT6737 quad-core processor and its paired with just 1GB RAM. It is adequate for individual tasks, but not with 5-6 apps running in the background or games such as Shadow Fight 3. The Redmi 5A, which runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 quad-core processor with 2GB RAM, feels a lot smoother to use.. The other niggle with the Bharat 5 is the glossy back design, which smudges too much and makes the smartphone slippery at times. Redmi 5A looks more premium and handy with its lustreless metal back.. Bharat 5 has a glossy back design.. Like most budget smartphones, camera is not one of the strong points of Bharat 5. It has a 5-megapixel primary camera for regular shots and a 5-megapixel front camera for selfies. It supports manual focus and offers modes such as Bokeh, Beauty, and Time Lapse, but the overall picture quality is average. Colours look washed out and dull on the phone’s screen itself. The front camera can capture good looking selfies if lighting is good.. It has a 5-megapixel primary camera for regular shots and a 5-megapixel front camera for selfies.. Bharat 5 is a typical big-battery smartphone with big and burly form factor. In comparison to the Redmi 5A, it feels a little bulky when held.. First Published: Mon, Dec 11 2017.

Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..
