Asus Zenfone Live ZB501KL - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 4 5 6 Â». This or Samsung J2 pro? Thnx in Advance :). So i already using this phone for about a month, nice phone, comfortable to use in my hand, no lag whatsoever when using apps (never tried games tho). But theres couple of thing i want to ask. When i use video call in app such as Line, Google Duo, its kinda dark on my side, but not when i use the camera app. Yep, this is a phone with 2.5D curved display, so tempered glass wont stick on the edge. Is this phone has some protection like gorilla glass so i dont have to use my tempered glass? Its kind of bugging me to see the halo effect on the edge. I just bought my zenfone live the other day. Even for the ZEN Keyboard, Google Text to Speech, ASUS Caller ID, etc... Every time I use my phone, there's always this issue. I updated all my apps, factory data reset 3 times, cleared the caches. Any solution for this matter? Thank you!. Nimr0d, 10 Dec 2017 which is better for gaming Zenfone live or J2 prime..?. Zenfone live better Sam J2 prime problem with memory phone.

And the sim toolkit is malfunctioning. more Try cleaning cleaning the fone with wd-40 cleaning liquid. which is better for gaming Zenfone live or J2 prime..?. Either you are totally ignorant or just biased, or just both. I have no problems with fb and it doesn't overheat at all.. Am using the phone now for 4 months and NOTHING to complain about. My only problem is that I can't find information on how to transfer my pictures to the SD card.. Nice design but sd410 is piece of crap. Overheating and causing CPU speed turn down to 800mhz only. It will also causing battery drain for high temperature.. guys im the person who loves to save a lot of pictures and videos on external storage, also i might buy 256gb sdcard but i'm confused with the specifications of both zenfone live and zenfone 3 max. which one would suits better to keep big gb of sdcard and would not cause any crap on storage? helppp. PhoneTabletLover, 22 Oct 2017 I will buy this phone, as my second phone.

Tony Grenier, 09 Oct 2017 When i hear all the ''ahhh it's lagging'' or ''ahhh it's the worst don't buy form asus''... more Hey there, which second phone do you think I should buy?. Asus Zenfone Live or Samsung Galaxy J3 Pro?. Tony Grenier, 09 Oct 2017 When i hear all the ''ahhh it's lagging'' or ''ahhh it's the worst don't buy form asus''... more I will buy this phone, as my second phone. My top priority phone that I would buy is the Huawei P10 Plus, while my second priority is this Zenfone Live. I want to buy a phone that is under MYR 700 (MYR is Malaysian Ringgit, simply known as RM), and this cost around MYR 599. I have an old SIM card (from 2008, with no GPRS and EDGE connectivity, and no 3G and 4G LTE support) that I could use it into this Zenfone Live. Because, let's face it, texting on a flip phone is REALLY excruciating.. SaRPeR, 19 Aug 2017 It comes with Snapdragon 410. CPU Z says it is powered by Snapdragon 400. When i hear all the ''ahhh it's lagging'' or ''ahhh it's the worst don't buy form asus''... This is a ULTRA cheap phone, look a the specs before buying, it's a quad core 1.2ghz cpu and 2gb ram phone.... I just bought this phone last June. And the sim toolkit is malfunctioning. Also, the dirth got on the back cover because of my phone case is non cleanable. I tried all possible tips in cleaning phones, but the dirth still hasn't got off.

The smartphone has one of the best microphone setup installed inside it that delivers unmatchable audio recording at its price tag. For people who frequently go online for live streaming and want to get a smartphone for it, Zenfone Live is a good choice. However, if youÃ¢ÂÂre looking for a smartphone for multitasking, Hardcore gaming, lots of video playback and an overall swift interface, Zenfone live would not be the best option for you.

The device comes with a lightweight design, coupled good display and decent camera performance in broad daylight. But the phone let down with a heavy user interface, struggles in low light conditions and has an average battery life.

Even then, 9 out of 10 times, you're better off buying another phone than Asus's one-trick pony. The ZenFone Live has been found lacking on almost all the other fronts both on paper and in terms of real world usage to an extent that it's surprising that such a phone even exists in today's world.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs a good idea which hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been implemented very well. The phone itself cannot match its competition. It is running on buggy software, powered by an old chipset and offers very low-end features. While the dedicated app to make live broadcasts is decent, there isnÃ¢ÂÂt much to it apart from adding a filter. A fully loaded app would have made some justice.

News Asus Zenfone Live (ZB501KL) review: Move beyond selfie phones, enter live video. Asus Zenfone Live (ZB501KL) review: Move beyond selfie phones, enter live video. The Zenfone Live brings âreal-time beautificationâ feature for your Facebook, YouTube and Instagram live videos. But does it make the Zenfone live a worthwhile purchase?. Updated: June 5, 2017 7:09 PM IST. Asus Zenfone Live â Beauty Live app. Asus Zenfone Live â The Good. Asus Zenfone Live â The Bad. In recent times, smartphone manufacturers have shifted their focus from the usual price and specifications wars, to the niche, selfie-loving audience. While Oppo and Vivo have focussed on high-resolution front-facing cameras, Asus seems interested in live videos. The companyâs latest budget smartphone, Asus Zenfone Live , comes with a real-time beautification mode to make you look good in live-videos.. The real-time beautification mode works on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram live videos. But does the feature work as expected to beautify your presence in live videos? Also, with other smartphones such as Lenovo K6 Power, Xiaomi Redmi 4, Vivo Y53 and Redmi Note 4 offering better specifications, does the Zenfone Live make for an obvious choice at its price tag of Rs 9,999? Letâs find out in our detailed review.. The Zenfone Live features a 5-inch HD (720p) display. The screen is bright, colors look decent, and viewing angles are good too. The smartphone is powered by Qualcommâs Snapdragon 400 quad-core chipset, which is slightly outdated, and it would have been better if Asus had gone for Snapdragon 430 octa-core chipset instead.. The chipset is coupled with 2GB of RAM and 16GB on-board storage, which can be further expanded using a microSD card. At the rear, you get a 13-megapixel camera with LED flash,. whereas on the front, you have a 5-megapixel camera for selfies and video calling. You also get an LED light for better low-light selfies. Connectivity options include Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 4G LTE with VoLTE voice calling support and GPS. ALSO READ: Asus Zenfone 3S Max (ZC521TL) Review. Now, letâs talk about the key USP of the smartphone, the âBeauty Liveâ app. The working of this app is very simple â it kicks in as soon as a supported live stream app is detected. You get an on-screen overlay (slider) to choose between 10 levels of beautification. Basically, it applies a bit of blush along with skin brightening and skin softening effects to your face when you go live on social networks.. Does it work? Well, the simple answer is yes. I tested the feature using Facebook live videos, and the real-time beautification worked exactly as the as Asus proclaims it to be. That being said, we come to an important question â does the real-time beautification filter add any value to your live videos? No, it does not. ALSO READ: Xiaomi Redmi 4 Review: Big on everything, small in size. Itâs nice to have the beautification filter that can smoothen the skin, and hide those black spots and blemishes to make you look better. But it clearly looks completely artificial. When used outdoors under bright lighting conditions, the skin tones go for a toss, colors of clothes and the background, all looks completely washed out.. When going live indoors, under ambient lighting conditions, the skin tones look dull, and the video has a lot of graininess too. Sure, the 5-megapixel front-facing camera of aperture f/2.2 is to be blamed to some extent. ALSO READ: Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe (ZS570KL) Review. When the front camera is one of the USPâs of your smartphone, I would rather expect a better sensor with higher resolution and larger aperture to be able to capture more light.. Now letâs look at the overall performance of the smartphone.. Smartphones with metal frame have become a norm these days, and Asus has done nothing new with the Zenfone Live. The front is dominated by the 5-inch display covered with 2.5D curved glass. You have the front-facing camera, earpiece and soft-light LED flash for capturing better selfies in low-light. Below the display, you have capacitive touch buttons for back, home and app switcher.. The left edge has a hybrid SIM card slot for dual SIM cards or one SIM card and one microSD card. On the right edge, you have the volume rocker and power button. The 3.5mm audio jack is place on the top, whereas the microUSB port for charging and data transfer is placed at the bottom.. The back has a metallic place with the camera module with LED flash on the top-left, and Asus branding on the upper half. The edges are smooth and have curved finish, and the compact form factor makes it easier to hold and operate the smartphone in one hand.. The combination of Snapdragon 410 SoC and 2GB of RAM works well to offer smooth performance for day-to-day activities. I did not notice any lag while doing usual task like chatting over with friends on WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Slack and or while going through my Facebook or Twitter timeline. ALSO READ: Coolpad Note 5 Lite Review: Fingerprint sensor and front flash on a budget. However, the lag is noticeable when you are surfing on the Chrome browser with about three-to-four tabs open. Even though the overall performance is smooth, the time taken to open and load apps is a little too much, especially, when over five apps are running in background. A lot of it can be blamed on the Asus for not using a powerful chipset.. Gaming experience on the smartphone is average. Casual games such as Super Mario Run , Subway Surfers and Temple Run work without any hiccups. It is only when you play graphics intense games such as Modern Combat 5: Blackout or Asphalt 8: Airborne when you notice some stuttering due to low frame rates.. At the back, the Zenfone Live features a 13-megapixel snapper of aperture f/2.0. The camera works well in bright outdoor conditions. Photos have enough details, color accuracy is decent and close-up shots look good too. Photos shot indoors are average, but the low-light ones tend to show some graininess. But considering the price tag, the photo quality is on par. Battery Life Asus has included power saving feature in âMobile Managerâ app, with four modes â performance, normal, power saving and super saving. And as there is no power-hungry chipset or GPU on board, the Zenfone Live delivers a decent battery life. With low to moderate usage, I was able to get full dayâs worth backup on full charge, with screen-on-time of about four hours. Even with slightly heavy usage, I managed to get screen-on-time of about three-and-a-half hours. ALSO READ: Xiaomi Redmi 4A Review: The new king of affordable smartphones. No fingerprint scanner Even smartphones like Xiaomi Redmi 4 and Coolpad Note 5 Lite placed between Rs 7,000 to Rs 8,500 feature a fingerprint scanner for biometric authentication. It is bad to see Asus ignoring the security aspect even though the Zenfone Live is priced relatively higher than the competitors. User Interface and Operating System The smartphone runs Android Marshmallow OS with layer of Asuz Zen UI on top, that is despite the fact that Android Nougat has been out there for over seven month now.. Another bummer, as always with Asus smartphones, is the bloatware issue. Asus has loaded up the smartphone with bloatware apps such as ZenCircle, MiniMovie, DoItLater,. Go2Pay among others, and sadly, you canât uninstall most of them either. ALSO READ: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Review Front Camera Even though front-camera plays a crucial role here, I was left disappointed with the Live video quality. And the same is persistent with photo quality too. Below are four photos, two captured on Zenfone Live and the other two on Xiaomi Redmi 4. Now, even without beautification mode, the Redmi 4 does a better job, compared to the Zenfone Live. Clearly, the Zenfone Live does not live up to the expectations, especially with the feature it is being highlighted for.. Overall, the Asus Zenfone Live is placed in a tough spot. Asus has been highlighting the front-facing camera and live beautification mode of the smartphone. However, the camera isnât able to capture better-looking photos. Ideally, I would expect the live beautification mode to add effects in a way that it looks natural, but thatâs not the case here.. Be it live videos or selfies, they need to look great, considering what Asus claims the beautification mode does. However, a Xiaomi Redmi 4 which does not boast any special beautification software, does a better job, be it while capturing selfies or recording live videos. It also features decent specifications and features for the price. Even the Coolpad Note 5 Lite, Lenovo K6 Power and Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 offer better value for money compared to the Zenfone Live..

The Zenfone Live has a good HD display and front selfie camera with flash for better live streaming along with the beautify app. But the good aspects end there, with a 4 year old hardware which struggles with performance and a steep price tag wonÃ¢ÂÂt help Zenfone Live in sales. If you are into live streaming quite often, probably the Zenfone Live is worth a try.

ASUS ZenFone Live Hands-on [Images] Quelle: Mobygyaan ENâDE The phone is available at Ã¢ÂÂ¹9,999, but the pricing seems not convincing when we compare the phone with the existing Chinese rivals.

The smartphone has one of the best microphone setup installed inside it that delivers unmatchable audio recording at its price tag. For people who frequently go online for live streaming and want to get a smartphone for it, Zenfone Live is a good choice. However, if youÃ¢ÂÂre looking for a smartphone for multitasking, Hardcore gaming, lots of video playback and an overall swift interface, Zenfone live would not be the best option for you.

Asus Zenfone Live Review Quelle: The Mobile Indian ENâDE Overall, the smartphone has its shares of hits and misses. The device comes with a lightweight design, coupled good display and decent camera performance in broad daylight. But the phone let down with a heavy user interface, struggles in low light conditions and has an average battery life. Though the real-time beautification camera is tempting, but when it comes to sheer performance, the device is an underdog when compared to the likes of Xiaomi Redmi 4, Lenovo K6 Power and so on.

Even then, 9 out of 10 times, you're better off buying another phone than Asus's one-trick pony. The ZenFone Live has been found lacking on almost all the other fronts both on paper and in terms of real world usage to an extent that it's surprising that such a phone even exists in today's world.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs a good idea which hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been implemented very well. The phone itself cannot match its competition. It is running on buggy software, powered by an old chipset and offers very low-end features. While the dedicated app to make live broadcasts is decent, there isnÃ¢ÂÂt much to it apart from adding a filter. A fully loaded app would have made some justice.

ASUS Zenfone Live Review Quelle: Yugatech ENâDE While we wrap our review, we canÃ¢ÂÂt help but conclude that the Zenfone Live, sans the BeautyLive feature, is what could have been the latest Zenfone Go. Nonetheless, weÃ¢ÂÂre glad to ASUS opening up live streaming to the masses. If only ASUS partnered with a telco to sponsor the data costs, it would have been a complete package.

ZenFone Live is the worldâs first smartphone with hardware-optimized, real-time beautification technology that makes it possible to share an even more glamorous version of yourself â live! With large pixels for 2X-greater light sensitivity and a soft-light LED selfie flash, live-streaming your selfie video has never been clearer, brighter or more beautiful. ZenFone Live also features dual-microphone technology that reduces background noise and enhances voice pickup, as well as an innovative five-magnet speaker system with a smart amp to deliver powerful audio. Stream live â and beautifully â with ZenFone Live!. ZenFone Live has a pair of sensitive MEMS microphones that are expertly tuned and precisely positioned to reduce noise and ensure that your voice is heard. With dual-microphone, ZenFone Live captures realistic stereo sound. Whether youâre walking down a busy street, partying in a noisy bar, or in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the shopping mall, ZenFone Live ensures youâll be heard every time you share your stream.. ZenFone Liveâs brilliant display shines brightly through a strong glass thatâs precision-milled at the edges to create a gentle, 2.5D curve. The natural, ergonomic feel of the glass flows around to the back. It also has an impressive 75% screen-to-body ratio, for more screen and less bulk. The ZenFone Liveâs metallic-style finish feels as great as it looks, and you can choose between two stunning colors âGold and Navy Black. The ZenFone Live comes with a 5-inch 720p display.

When coupled with its excellent viewing angles -- along with its mostly non-reflective nature -- that phone metes out a display that works really well even when you're outside and on the go.. ZenFone Live features a powerful speaker that employs a five-magnet design with a metal voice coil to produce loud and clear audio with supreme quality in every scenario. This speaker is powered by a smart amp that increases audio resolution and loudness while ensuring that the speaker is not damaged. Youâre even able to surround yourself with sound. ZenFone Live features DTS Headphone:Xâ¢, a revolutionary surround-sound technology that synthesizes a full 7.1-channel virtual surround-sound experience, making all content sound better over headphones.. It bears a 2650mAh battery thatâs rated to provide up to 158.8 hours of standby time, up to 24 hours of 3G talk-time and 17.1 hours of Wi-Fi browsing. Sensors on board include an accelerometer , ambient light sensor, digital compass, and a proximity sensor..

Asus ZenFone Live ZB501KL: Detailed Streaming Phone Asus ZenFone Live ZB501KL Help Camera Design Performance Software Display. Asus ZenFone Live ZB501KL has been set to do it but fails this lively beauty feature is a gimmick that really does not work. In addition, the phone does not perform very well, nor does it have any stand-out feature that spends on expenditure, it is not a good purchase.. The phone is considered the first to come with real-time beautification camera, which basically beautifies your face while going live on Facebook or any other social media platform.. Asus has added another member in its Genfon series with the launch of Asus ZenFone Live ZB501KL Smartphone; the device comes with a price of 9,999 rupees and will be available on Flipchart. The phone is considered the first to come with real-time beautification camera, which basically beautifies your face while going live on Facebook or any other social media platform.. Something interesting to offer a Smartphone in this regard, but what are the other things like total performance, camera, and battery? Weâve spent some time with the device and here we think of Asus ZenFone Live ZB501KL.. When Facebook announced the aspirations of their live stream for the first time, many applauded the move as a revolutionary. It is true that live streaming on the internet is the fastest way to get information for the world, and live stream television can give a run for your money on Facebook or YouTube. And itâs on the betting on Taiwanâs SES. The companyâs new phone, Asus Zenfone Live is âthe worldâs first live streaming Smartphoneâ.. The âlive streamâ part of Asus ZenFone Live ZB501KL ends in an app inside the phone and ends as it is called Asus Beauty Live and before that many graceful apps has done it. As the name suggests, when you are life, the app beautifies your face, it has a simple interface, which has a slider that lets you select between one and 10 reinforcement levels. The Booth line live feature is also available for video shot with the front camera.. Beautification on this app is similar to any other beautifying app. This is the first such application, though not for live video. Its aim is to make the photo bright and to improve the skin tone.. Asus Zenfone Live follows the design language, which is similar to the other smartphones available at this price range. However, we liked that in fact, this device is very light because it weighs only 120 grams. The phone is compact and does not slip by hand, which is a good thing to play the front 5 inch screen, as well as on top of the base and front-facing camera along with the physical navigation as well as the front flash and earpiece Plays Volume control and power on/off buttons of the right homes, while on the left you will get a hybrid sim slot.. At the top, there is a headphone jack, while there is also a speaker grill with Micro USB port on the base. The primary camera with LED flash on the back and it can get its bottom, will get a chrome-plated Asus logo Overall, the device is lightweight and can work smoothly, thanks to all compact designs.. To launch beautified videos, just open this app, choose the level of beautification and tap the Facebook or YouTube option to go live. Tapping on these options will actually open the related app, and the rest of the live streaming process is just as common as it is. Asus is launching with these two apps right now but plans to add support for Instagram and Periscope as well.. In one word, the answer will not be there. Asusâ softens the tone of the skin to hide the algorithm (blemish) and shines the background to some extent is a slider so that you can choose between 1-10 level beautifications. With each, overall brightness increases slightly and the skin tone is soft. But, by doing so, the phone loses almost all details on your face, which makes it look quite unnatural.. Thatâs disappointing to be honest, offering the phone for the only gimmick, I hope so much more. The Asusâ Beauty Live app is essentially a beautification app that does not work very well. Except for the fact that it connects to Facebook and other apps, in fact, there is no new or innovative here. On the other hand, live video is often done through the back camera, whereas the Asus app only spreads to sophistication. Which means that its utility is limited to starting.. Asus has installed a 5 MP camera on the front for its own video and video. Pixel size is quite large here, but image quality is not something really, in fact, dual cameras were installed with the opposition, Vivo and other companies.. On the front, this is not exactly affected, of course, Asus ZenFone Live ZB501KL is very cheap, but even a neat camera is in Newbie M2 Light (which is in this price at Ballpark). Asus has added a âsoft lightâ Flash on the front for a good solution, but with any flash, this is not a big difference.. The images appear blurred and unnatural even with the graceful level 0. By pushing them to 10, all the details will be removed too. Color reproduction is also limited, which means that the overall effect of selfish is nothing but normal. Once again, you would expect that the front camera on such a Smartphone would be more advanced.. It is also suitable for the 13 MP rear cameras, it can take useful shots in good light, but often gets spoiled due to low light loss due to excessive noise and expansion, and the colors seem almost always bright. When we click on light conditions, we saw thick grains, and the contrast levels are less than the norm. The rear camera is quite useful when shooting with enough time on your hands, but it often loses focus, even when youâre tapping to focus.. Asus Zenfone Live is a plastic body, but it is well designed and light. Under the display are the capacitive buttons for home, back and more, while the power on/off button and volume rotation is on the right side. This is a traditional candy bar design, but the one that still affects. Genfone Live is easy to use with one hand and does not feel uncomfortable in your pocket. It will also qualify as attractive.. In front of it, there is a 5-megapixel shooter 1.4-micron pixel size and aperture F / 2.2 and 82-degree viewing area. The front also has a soft light LED flash. During broad daylight, the Smartphone can take some good shots, although the description was above average. The camera UI is easy to operate and loads in some interesting ways, including auto, HDR Pro, beautification, super resolution, kids, low light, QR code, night, effect and so on. HDR Pro Mode works fine because. It adds more important details to the photos without revealing the colors present in the photo..

First of all, there is a small amount of flex in the body, if you try to press it down, more importantly; sim slot (at least on our review unit) will not be ejected. Inserting the pin unlocks the SIM tray, but it was imposing on it, as much as it needs to be.. Now, where things are completely different from here, you will expect the phone to live streaming to support the best LTE standards and it can provide the fastest user experience. The last thing you want to know is that when itâs going live. The phone is slow to slow down or a heavy app before Facebook is heavy. But this is exactly what Asians Gene Fong Live.. Genfone runs on the Snapdragon 400, which Qualcomm now classifies as a chipset for wearable. The two-year-old chipset supports up to 4 (downlink) speeds. Which means that it is not really up to the modern standards. It is not that you will feel the difference in practical terms.. Where you think that although regular use is Asus Zenfone Live stutter and the show is quite easy. It only has 2 GB RAM, which again puts it behind the phone in this price range. Multitasking is not its strong suit but is it using gaming or phone for simple tasks. Itâs as of todayâs Smartphone Looks like it does not look faster There are no heating issues. But while browsing on Google Chrome, the phone looks slow. After scrolling through your Facebook news feed or launching the app after each other.. On the software front, this phone runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow in which the companyâs UI runs. The touch experience is good and it comes. With some interesting features such as phone manager, blue light filter and more. Which provides you with separate audio presets by pressing any recent menu button and holding it, is actually an accessory.. In addition to this, by opening an application that opens any application and three buttons in the top right corner. Which apps can lock by clicking on Then there is a glove mode. Which increases touch sensitivity when wearing gloves. Any settings can change the Quick Settings option by going to Settings> Asus customized settings. In addition, call connectivity is good and earpiece is also audible in busy environments. The speaker output is optimal and when you increase/decrease the volume, you get the option to choose between outdoor and indoor settings.. Featuring two things about Genfox Live, including several things, on one hand, color and acuity are adequate. But it is difficult to use poor viewing angles. I often stream movies on my phone, it is difficult to present. It against something here because the colors can be easily visible Give it.. On top, the screen looks decent and colors are very balanced like other Asus smartphones. Personally, I would have dark black, but the colorful tones looked natural and admirable. The display is also dim, which means that the visibility of sunlight is optimum.. On paper, Asus ZenFone Live ZB501KL battery is not very big, and you will not expect too much here. However, the phone will tell you about a working day about regular use. With about one hour or more of streaming on Amazon Prime, some social networking, many IMs and nearly five calls. The phone lasted approximately 10-12 hours on full charge. It stays within 8 hours on the PC Mark Battery Test, today it keeps it around industry standards.. To sum up, Asus ZenFone Live ZB501KL fails to achieve the goal As Asus was kept in mind. Its sleek app is nothing but normal and with many smart cameras, there are many Smartphoneâs available Similarly. The rear camera is also not great is. The same, and the fact that the phone is noticeably slow. It means Redmi Note 4, Redmi 4, Lenovoâs 6 power and most others are better Smartphoneâs than this, even for live streaming videos.. In addition, Zenfone Live has only 16 GB of storage, which is always a deal breaker in our books. There is no fingerprint sensor in it and there is nothing that makes it worth thinking about opponents.. TAGS Asus ZenFone Live Asus ZenFone Live ZB501KL ZenFone Live.
