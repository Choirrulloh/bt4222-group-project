Couple these SD6xx SoCs with a large battery like that and you have a phone that's nearly impossible to kill within a day or two. She typically goes to bed with 30+% left and 6-7 hours of Screen-on time over a 16 hour day. No SD820 device of it's time I've seen could come near that with the same 3500ish mAh size battery.. and this where priority would compel certain people to get this vs other current budget flagships. To be fair with stock Android even a 660 with decent flash storage would be overkill. Feb 25, 2018 at 4:10 PM. Feb 25, 2018 at 4:10 PM. Do you already have an account?.

Nokia 4, Nokia 7 Plus May Launch in 2018, Reveals Nokia Camera App. Jagmeet Singh , 02 January 2018. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Nokia Camera app reveals upcoming Nokia smartphones. The app suggests Nokia 4 and Nokia 7 Plus in the pipeline. It also lists the rumoured Nokia smartphones that could debut in 2018. Days after the initial information emerged regarding the first Nokia-branded Android Go smartphone, a partial list of HMD Global's Nokia smartphones for 2018 has been spotted. The default Nokia Camera app has revealed that the Finnish manufacturer is preparing the Nokia 4, Nokia 7 Plus alongside the recently rumoured Android Go-based Nokia 1. This comes in the midst of the reports highlighting the forthcoming announcements of the Nokia 6 (2018) , Nokia 8 (2018) , and the Nokia 9 .. As reported by folks at GizChina, the discovery of the new Nokia phones has emerged after unzipping the APK file of the Camera app. This includes the Nokia 4 and Nokia 7 Plus, neither of which had been leaked up until now. Also, the app components also point to the rumoured Nokia 9, Nokia 8 (2018), Nokia 6 (2018), and Nokia 1. It is unclear whether HMD will unveil all the listed smartphone models at a single event or throughout 2018. However, the new finding suggests that there are at least five new Android-based Nokia smartphones coming this year.. GizChina speculates that the Nokia 7 Plus, being the bigger version of the last year's Nokia 7, could come with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chip. But the unearthed Nokia 4 is likely to be an all-new offering with a fresh set of specifications.. Late last month, Russian tipster Eldar Murtazin claimed that HMD is launching the Nokia 1 as a part of Google's Android Oreo (Go edition) programme in March. The smartphone is rumoured to have an HD IPS display, 1GB RAM, and 8GB onboard storage. Further, it was claimed to carry a price tag of RUB 5,990 (roughly Rs. While the launch of the Nokia 1 is rumoured for March, HMD recently came in the news for planning the announcement of the flagship Nokia 9 at an event in China for January 19. The new top-end Nokia smartphone is expected to join the stage with the Nokia 6 (2018) and Nokia 8 (2018) that both are likely to be the upgrades of the original Nokia 6 and Nokia 8 .. Last week, Nokia 3310 4G variant also emerged on TENAA certification site with Android-based YunOS. It is speculated to soon join the 2018 Nokia portfolio..

Nokia 7 Plus with Android One, Full HD+ display is finally official. by Oliver Cragg 16 hours ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. leaks , the Nokia 7 Plus has finally been made official at MWC 2018. HMD Global will bring the sub-flagship to selected markets in Europe this April priced at â¬399.. The Nokia 7 Plus is a fairly significant upgrade over the vanilla Nokia 7 and is the first phone in the rebooted brandâs portfolio that sports an elongated 18:9 aspect ratio display. The Full HD+ 6-inch IPS LCD panel combines with a premium chassis built from 6,000 series aluminum, coated with ceramic paint, to ensure the phone looks and feels like a premium device despite its mid-range price-tag.. In the software department, the Nokia 7 Plus joins the growing ranks of Googleâs bloatware-free Android One initiative. That means users will get as close to a âpureâ Android experience as possible, as well as timely OS upgrades and security patches.. While it wonât rival the best in the business, the 7 Plus is no slouch under the hood either. Qualcommâs Snapdragon 660 SoC is paired with 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage. HMD is also promised up to two days of battery life based on everyday use.. The biggest changes over the original Nokia 7 are reserved for the cameras, which are boosted by Carl Zeiss optics. Unlike its predecessorâs single-sensor module, the 7 Plus sports a dual-camera on the rear with a 12 MP standard and a 13 MP telephoto sensor combo.. The front-facing camera, meanwhile, clocks in at 16 MP. Thereâs also a new Pro camera mode for amateur photographers who want to fiddle with advanced imaging settings like exposure, white balance, aperture, and more.. Weâll be putting the Nokia 7 Plus through its paces for a full review at a later date, but itâs hard not to be impressed at the âpremiumâ appeal of HMDâs sub-â¬400 phone.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Stand by for another mid-range Nokia handset from Finnish start-up HMD Global as it starts updating the first generation Android-powered handsets it released last year .. The latest handset details come from the ever-leaky Geekbench , which records the Nokia 7 Plus comes with an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 eight-core system-on-chip running at 1.84 GHz - the Nokia 7 shipped with the Snapdragon 630. The model tested had 4GB of RAM, although there could be other specifications in the mix when the 7 Plus goes on sale (the original Nokia 7 shipped with 4GB or 6GB options).. The distinctive camera housing of the Nokia smartphone (photo: Ewan Spence). It’s worth noting that the Nokia 7 was only released in China as part of the first wave of Android-powered handsets from HMD Global. That leaves a clear space in the mid-range market for the Nokia 7 Plus to exploit in 2018. Finally, the benchmarking tool records the device as running Android Oreo. The original Nokia 7 still ships with Android Nougat.. The ‘Plus’ designation obviously covers the larger system on chip. The other feature that the public would regard as a ‘Plus’ would be the screen. The Nokia 7 came with a 5.2-inch screen and 64GB of storage. Look for both of these numbers to rise when the Nokia 7 Plus breaks cover.. That moment could be happening next month. With HMD Global already confirming an event at the opening of MWC on Sunday 25th February , there were indications that the high-end Nokia 9 handset would lead the party while the Nokia 1 will go for the volume play. That leaves a gap in the middle, and it looks like the Nokia 7 Plus is ready to fill that gap in the portfolio.. Now read more about Nokia’s crazy camera with five lenses….

Nokia 7 Plus gets benchmarked with Snapdragon 660 SoC ahead of likely MWC debut. Adrian Diaconescu January 29, 2018 11:27 am. Who can rain on Samsung’s pre-MWC 2018 parade ? As Huawei is widely expected to wait until April for the official announcement of the P20 trio ( not P11 ), and LG still seems more likely to bring an upgraded V30 to Barcelona instead of an all-new G7 , that pretty much leaves Sony as the only high-profile exhibitor with a flagship phone in the pipeline .. There’s also HMD Global, which has recently started teasing the launch of “awesome” new Nokia devices at this year’s Mobile World Congress. The Finnish company even had the audacity to schedule its event on the same day as the Galaxy S9 “Unpacking”, although it remains unclear if HMD truly wants to go after tomorrow’s high-priced hero smartphones .. In addition to a long overdue Nokia 9 high-ender , an ultra-low-cost Nokia 1, mid-end 4 and upper mid-range 7 Plus might see daylight soon as well. The unreleased Nokia 7 Plus is mentioned by name in a new Geekbench record, revealing possibly the handset’s most significant upgrade.. While the original 7 packs a Snapdragon 630 processor paired with either 4 or 6GB RAM, the 7 Plus apparently carries a Snapdragon 660 SoC, both chips capping off at 2.2GHz in clock speeds. They’re both octa-core arrangements also featuring lower-power 1.8GHz CPU nuclei, but the 660 substantially improves central and graphics processing performance.. Unsurprisingly running Android 8.0 Oreo already, the just-benchmarked Nokia 7 Plus prototype also packs 4GB RAM, although a 6 gig option is definitely possible. And so is US availability for a change.. Android , Benchmarks , Geekbench , HMD , HMD Global , News , Nokia , Nokia 7 , Nokia 7 Plus , Rumors.

Nokia 4, Nokia 7 Plus, Nokia 1 rumored to be joining Nokia 6 (2018), Nokia 8 (2018) and Nokia 9. by Alan Friedman. Tags :. Nokia - Nokia + Android - Android +. A couple of newcomers might be getting ready to join Nokia 's rumored 2018 smartphone lineup. An APK file for the default Nokia camera app has revealed that the Nokia 4 and Nokia 7 Plus will be joining the Nokia smartphone lineup this year. Other Nokia branded phones already leaked include the Nokia 6 (2018) , Nokia 8 (2018), Nokia 9 and the Nokia 1. The latter will be Nokia's first Android One (Go Edition) model. No specs belonging to the Nokia 4 and Nokia 7 Plus have been leaked, but judging by the name, we would expect that the Nokia 7 Plus will sport a display larger than the 5.2-inches seen on the Nokia 7. Additionally, the Nokia 7 Plus should be powered by a more powerful mobile platform than the Snapdragon 630 SoC that you'll find inside the Nokia 7. The Nokia 1 could come with an IPS LCD screen carrying a 720 x 1280 HD resolution. There could be 1GB of RAM and 8GB of native storage inside. On January 17th, we expect to see The Nokia 6 (2018), Nokia 8 (2018) and the Nokia 9 unveiled. The latter will be a new flagship model carrying a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with thin bezels, and an 18:9 aspect ratio. Under the hood will be the Snapdragon 835 chipset. On back will be a dual-camera setup featuring optics from Carl Zeiss. Images of the phone 's rear cover popped up more than a couple of months ago, and showed the dual camera setup and the rear-facing fingerprint scanner. Android 8.0 will be installed right out of the box, and the handset will be equipped with a Type-C USB port. The Nokia 9 will be priced at €750 (equivalent to $903 USD). All together, this would add up to six new Nokia branded handsets expected to be introduced over the next few months by HMD Global. Galaxy S9 vs iPhone X hands-on: A battle royale.

Trending iPhone X Nintendo Switch OnePlus 5T Tesla Model 3 Xbox One X. Here’s yet another look at the Nokia 7 Plus. by Justin Herrick | February 19, 2018. Next week the mobile industry comes together at MWC 2018. HMD Global will join the trade show again this year to announce several new handsets, including the Nokia 7+. It’ll be a mid-range phone much like its predecessor that only launched in the second half of 2017. And while the specifications and design will likely be very similar to the Nokia 7, the Nokia 7+ should ship in some interesting colors.. Recently there was a leak that showed the Nokia 7+ in two colors. First the phone was leaked with a white body, orange accents, and black front. The other model swapped the white body for black (that could possibly be brown).. When the black-based model leaked, we didn’t see the front. It already appeared online in a live shot last week, but now the Nokia 7+ in black with orange accents surfaced in a leaked press render.. Evan Blass, the mobile industry insider at. VentureBeat , posted the image on Twitter saying he figured everyone would want to see it. Phones are usually sold in bland colors recycled year after year, but HMD Global appears to be interested in adding flavor to its Nokia-branded hardware.. HMD Global didn’t publicly say on social media it is attending the upcoming trade show in Barcelona; however, we can confirm the company is hosting a meeting for attendees early on. We’ll stay tuned for that, and then pass along all of the latest when it goes official.. Justin is easily attracted to power buttons.

Nokia 4, Nokia 7 Plus and Nokia 1 names revealed by Nokia Camera app. Nokia 4, Nokia 7 Plus and Nokia 1 names revealed by Nokia Camera app. Updated: Wednesday, January 3, 2018, 11:32 [IST]. In 2017, HMD Global released an all new array of smartphones including the Nokia 6, Nokia 5, Nokia 3, Nokia 8, Nokia 7 and Nokia 2. This month, the company is expected to debut its launch spree with the announcement of Nokia 9 and Nokia 6 (2018). Though only two models are known for now, it does not mean that the company will not come up with more launches in 2018.. And, this is the same thing that the Nokia Camera app has revealed in a recent leak. As per a report by a Chinese publication ITHome via GizmoChina , the APK of the Nokia Camera app has revealed a list of Nokia smartphones of which some have been already released by HMD Global and some are yet to see the light of the day.. Talking about the upcoming Nokia smartphones, the Nokia Camera app has revealed the names of Nokia 4, Nokia 7 Plus and Nokia 1. Of these, we have already come across a report tipping that the Nokia 1 will be the company's Android Go (Oreo edition) smartphone that could be launched in March this year. But we have not heard about the Nokia 4 and Nokia 7 Plus and the details regarding these devices appear to be scarce.. As of now, there is possible information about when these smartphones will be launched. Given that the company might unveil the Nokia 9 and Nokia 6 (2018) at an event on January 19, we can expect HMD to have lined up at five or smartphones this year. Lately, we came across a report that the Nokia 10 could be launched in August with the Snapdragon 845 SoC but this leaked information has not revealed anything regarding this specific flagship model.. Other than the names of these smartphones, the leaked APK information of the Nokia Camera app has not revealed anything regarding the specifications of these upcoming devices. As the Nokia 7 Plus could be a bigger variant of the already existing Nokia 7, we can expect it to make use of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 SoC.. There is no assurance that these models will be released this year as this is just a leaked information and we need to take this as a speculation until further details hit the web..

Nokia 1, Nokia 7 Plus Renders Reveal Design, Specifications. Ankit Chawla , 15 February 2018. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Nokia 1 is expected to be HMD Global's entry-level offering. The Nokia 7 Plus is said to run Android One out-of-the-box. Nokia 7 Plus is expected to sport a dual camera setup with Zeiss lens. Just days after reports spotted a compact phone from HMD Global on US certification site FCC , reputed tipster Evan Blass (@evleaks) has outed the alleged press renders of the Nokia 1. The photos show a smartphone with a compact form factor, apparently meant for the budget segment. Additionally, Blass also posted renders of what is supposed to be the rumoured Nokia 7 Plus. The Nokia 1 is seen to sport a single rear camera, while the Nokia 7 Plus is shown to have a dual rear camera setup.. This seems to be the first instance where we have seen renders of the rumoured Nokia 1 from a credible source. The curved body design in the Nokia 1 renders is, however, unlike the leak we saw last week. Apart from that, the smartphone is seen in two unnamed colour variants.. Previous rumours of the Nokia 1 suggest the entry-level smartphone will sport an HD (720x1280 pixels) IPS display along with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of inbuilt storage.. Blass also tweeted two images of the upcoming Nokia 7 Plus. The images reveal that the phone will run Google's Android One out-of-the-box. Additionally, the renders show the Nokia 7 Plus will sport a dual rear camera setup with Zeiss lens and dual LED flash. There is also a fingerprint sensor below the camera module.. Rumours around the Nokia 7 Plus suggest the mid-range smartphone will be announced at MWC 2018. Reports claim the Nokia 7 Plus is expected to sport a 6-inch, 18:9 display, and a dual 12-megapixel + 13-megapixel camera sensor module on the back. The phone might come with 4GB of RAM and 64GB inbuilt storage..

Cameras Rear: Dual 12 MP and 13 MP telephoto with PDAF and Carl Zeiss optics. Front: 13 MP f/2.0 Rear: 16 MP with Carl Zeiss optics. IP rating IP 54 IP 54. Dimensions 158.4 x 75.6 x 7.9 mm 141.2 x 71.5 x 7.9 mm. HMD Global has unveiled a selection of new smartphones at MWC this year, including the new larger Nokia 7 Plus. As the name suggests, it’s a bigger version of last year’s Nokia 7. As well as the larger display size, the Plus model is the first Nokia phone to boast a 18:9 aspect ratio and Full HD+ resolution, a faster Snapdragon 660 processing package, and a more powerful rear dual camera setup.. Read: Hands-on with Nokia’s 2018 lineup at MWC Â. The biggest changes to the Nokia 7 Plus are located in the camera department. All three of the lenses have no been designed with Carl Zeiss optics, and the rear camera configuration now includes a telephoto lens. So instead of the single 16 megapixel camera, there’s now a 12 megapixel and 13 megapixel telephoto combination. Nokia is doubling down on the camera focus with an updated camera app and new features including exposure and white balance controls for photography enthusiasts.. The move over to a Snapdragon 660 mobile processor, up from the Snapdragon 630, offers a little more CPU grunt in the form of four Kryo 260 cores. Perhaps more noticeably, the Adreno 512 will offer up some additional gaming performance, and the chip also enables the wider Full HD+ display resolution. Both chip sets have the same X12 LTE modem.. Here’s a breakdown of the Nokia 7 Plus specifications, and how they stack up next to the smaller variant.. In addition to the internal hardware changes, the Nokia 7 Plus has had a slight redesign. The bezel have been slimmed down a tad so that the phone is only slightly larger than the Nokia 8, despite the larger display size. The edges have also been anodized twice to provide even more color variations.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is official: This is HMD Globalâs true flagship. Any thoughts on the Nokia 7 Plus?.

Nokia 7 Plus TA-1055 with 18:9 bezel-less display to be unveiled at MWC 2018. Nokia 7 Plus is expected to join the Nokia 9, Nokia 6 (2018), Nokia 7 and Nokia 3310 4G at the MWC 2018 show floor.. Published: Thursday, February 1, 2018, 10:38 [IST]. HMD Global will host an event on February 25 at the MWC 2018 tech show in Barcelona. At the event, the company is expected to announce the Nokia 9 flagship smartphone. Also, the global variants of the Nokia 6 (2018), Nokia 7 and newly announced Nokia 3310 4G variant are expected to be showcased at the tech show. While the launch of these devices is highly anticipated by the Nokia fans, another smartphone has hit the rumor mills.. Well, the talk is about the Nokia 7 Plus. Last week, the Nokia 7 Plus was spotted on Geekbench benchmark database with Android 8.0 Oreo, Snapdragon 660 chipset and 4GB RAM. Now, we have further details about the smartphone from a reliable source in China with knowledge about Foxconn's plans via NokiaPowerUser. If you aren't aware, Foxconn is responsible for the production of the Nokia smartphones.. The first thing that the source has let out about the Nokia 7 Plus is the model number. According to the report, the Nokia 7 Plus will carry the model number TA-1055. But we have not come across the device clearing any certification databases as of now. The next interesting claim is that the smartphone is said to be the first true bezel-less Nokia smartphone with a full-screen design. This means that the smartphone might flaunt a display with 18:9 aspect ratio.. Though the Nokia 9 is an upcoming flagship smartphone likely to sport an edge-to-edge display, the screen is said to have the traditional 16:9 aspect ratio instead of the 18:9 aspect ratio that has become the trend. So, we can expect the alleged Nokia 7 Plus to be the first 18:9 display smartphone to come from the stable of HMD Global.. The report doesn't end with revealed the information about the screen. It claims that the Nokia 7 Plus has already entered production and speculates that the company might unveil this smartphone at the MWC 2018. Having said that, we can expect the Nokia 7 Plus to have a great lineup to unveil a the upcoming tech show later this month. Until then, we need to wait for an official confirmation regarding the announcement of these smartphones..

ValueWalk Breaking News, Business, Politics, Technology. Nokia 7 Plus, Nokia 4 Spotted In APK Teardown Of Nokia’s Camera App. Nokia 7 Plus likely to run Snapdragon 660 processor. The APK teardown reveals exciting features. Here’s what we know about Nokia 9. The rumor mill has indicated that HMD Global is going to launch Nokia 6 (2018) and Nokia 8 (2018) at a media event later this month. The company is also expected to unveil the much-anticipated flagship Nokia 9 at the same event. Now evidence of a handful of other phones including Nokia 7 Plus and Nokia 4 has appeared on the Internet, thanks to a teardown of Nokia’s Camera app APK.. Android enthusiasts have used the APK teardowns for a long time to find out details of upcoming features and products. Folks at NokiaPowerUser have spotted hints of Nokia 9, Nokia 7 Plus, Nokia 4 and other unannounced products in the Camera APK (version. 8.0210.20) of Nokia 5 running Android Oreo Beta. It is unclear whether HMD Global would announce all the products at the January 19 media event or spread the launch throughout 2018.. Neither Nokia 7 Plus nor Nokia 4 had leaked until now. The Nokia 7 Plus is expected to be a bigger and more powerful version of last year’s Nokia 7. It could run Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 660 processor. The Nokia 4 will likely be an entirely new offering with a fresh set of specs. It would be interesting to see if Nokia 4 sees the light of the day because the number “4” is considered unlucky in China, one of the largest markets for HMD Global.. The APK teardown also mentioned the Nokia 1, which appeared in the rumor mill a few days ago. Nokia 1 is said to be based on Google’s Android Go program, and would cater to the lower-end market. It would offer 1GB RAM and 8GB of internal storage. The rumor mill claims Nokia 1 would launch in March.. It’s worth pointing out that the date corresponding to the files is 9/8/2016, which means the files were last created or modified in 2016. The company might have changed its plans for Nokia 7 Plus, Nokia 4, and other phones since then. But then we know that Nokia 9 is coming because it was seen passing through the FCC a few weeks ago.. The Camera app APK teardown has mentioned features like Pro Mode, Telephoto mode, Shutter speed control, and others. Nokia fans have already been waiting for these phones. The Pro Mode might be similar to the Lumia camera’s Pro Mode. The Telephoto mode might find its way into the premium Nokia 9, which is rumored to feature a wide-angle and a telephoto lens on the back.. HMD Global is also planning to launch a 4G variant of the Nokia 3310 feature phone. The 3310 4G version recently emerged on China’s TENAA certification site. The device would run Alibaba’s YunOS, which is based on Android. The current Nokia 3310 supports 3G and runs HMD’s proprietary Feature OS. The YunOS support means it will run Android apps.. Nokia fans are also excited about the flagship Nokia 9, which would compete with the iPhone X and Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S9 phones. The Nokia 9 has already received certification from the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC). According to FCC documents, Nokia 9 would sport a 5.5-inch OLED screen supplied by LG Display. It would feature a bezel-less display, which has become a standard for premium phones.. The FCC documents also revealed that the Nokia 9 would feature a 3250mAh battery with fast-charging technology. It will be powered by last year’s Snapdragon 835 processor rather than the latest Snapdragon 845, which could turn some customers off. The phone would have a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 13MP and a 12MP lens.. The rear camera would be positioned vertically. Zeiss, which makes camera lenses for the Nokia 8, is also expected to supply the Nokia 9 camera sensors. Sitting below the two rear cameras will be the fingerprint sensor. The LED flash is placed next to the camera. It is said to have a 5MP front-facing camera for selfies.. NokiaPowerUser recently published a video showing the back cover of the upcoming flagship. NokiaPowerUser demonstrated in the video that the back cover fits Nokia 3 perfectly. It indicates that the Nokia 9’s dimensions would be similar to Nokia 3, which is 143.4 x 71.4 x 8.48mm. Cutouts on the back cover also suggest that the phone would lack the 3.5mm headphone jack.. The power button and volume rockers can be seen on the right side of the phone. The mike, USB-C port, and speaker grille are located at the bottom. The FCC documents did not mention how much RAM it would offer, but we expect the phone to pack 128GB of internal storage. Nokia 9 would run the stock version of Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box. HMD Global has tried to differentiate its phones from rivals by offering the pure Android experience..
