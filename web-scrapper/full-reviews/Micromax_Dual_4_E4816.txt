Share your thoughts with other customers. There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Its a good phone with a "Indian" brand name. Its a good phone with a "Indian" brand name. I understand Micromax bought design and manufacturing rights from QiKU but atleast Micromax should have put their own version of UI/software instead of leaving remnants of QiKU's 360 OS. Also sometimes, pop-up's in Chinese-English is annoying and difficult to understand. Looks like they used google translator :-) ... Software update from Micromax is urgently needed.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Micromax dual 5.superb ..

I am using Mobile from 28 June..I salute Micromax for such service I have very small problem for that company have given mi new piece within 48 hours... Battery backup is really great and it extend by 360 app which expand Battery upto 50 minutes after boost ... Multitasking without any lack....About camera no words..Superb in class ..I compare with Vivo v5s &Oppo F3 and J 7 Max but no one able to come near by it..if Mobil is heated then heat source which bring mobile yo regular temp...4Gb ram 128 gb ROM which Superb...Front camera ...Dual camera mode are awesome ... Full paisa vasool ...mObile Go for it without any doubt... THANKX MICROMAX FOR SUCH AMAZING DEVICE..best luck. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Best in the league.. Though manufacturing and design rights are purchased from the Chinese company qiku, but users and all the critics should give rating based on the phone specifications and working not on its rights or company name. I have used Samsung Galaxy S4,S5 Sony Xperia ZR,M Dual after that I have purchased Micromax Knight only because of its brand Ambassador Hugh Jackman. But I got to find out that Micromax too make quality smart phones if given the price range. Knight was good, after that I used Knight 2. Now I have gone for Micromax Dual 5. Now coming on that, watching the price range I was considering Vivo V5 Plus, OPPO F3 Plus, One Plus 3T and Micromax Dual 5. It's being 1 month using the Dual 5. 1) Brilliant Battery Backup upto 12hrs if use continuously video streaming, hotspot on, calling and surfing. Standby is approximately 30hrs in normal uses of 5-6 hrs. 2)Secure vault is more than enough. 4) No heating issues even on hard usage and gaming. 5) Negligible lag time in opening applications. 6) Brilliant Front Camera quality and awesome soft flash. (For information it's not screen flash like some of the Moto phones, it's a regular flash but inside display,that's why soft flash. Nice idea behind that so that no effects on eyes.) 7) Very Useful pre-installed apps. 8) One hand usage on both sides of display not one side like other Os. 9) Quick charge takes minimum of 50min. Experimented not 45minutes but it's good because that factory tested without much app installed. 10) Best Service provided as 1 year accidental damage protection, home service. Now few negatives 1) Heats a little while quick charging. (No issues as this happens with all phones. It's common as if we quick charge it, more power is supplied so heating will be there a little.) 2) Rear Dual camera takes awesome picture in Daylight condition and Natural lighting conditions but in artificial light its quality is not challenging iPhone 6. Though it's a matter of laugh as I compared it to iPhone 6 rear camera but now both prices are approximately same. But in Natural light it's camera pictures are superior. 3) 3D video mode requires VR headset for a better experience. 4) Fingerprint if given in front it would have be awesome but then also its perfect. So, if you are thinking then go for it without any tension that it's Micromax and its price is high. It's giving you service and its Indian brand as well as quality product..
