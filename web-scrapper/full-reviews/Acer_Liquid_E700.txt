The Acer Model have display complaint. I am trying to change the Display.. But display not available any where... Using this phone now for almost two years. Screen is still like new after two years of heavy use and dusty fingers. Camera is great except no self timer. Speaker is not the best, Nokia beats everyone at that. But overall, the best phone I had so far. Looking for something to replace it with. acer e700 front camera not working. abby, 06 Mar 2017 i forgotten acer liquid pattern passwords and i also don't have a google account, please advice. i forgotten acer liquid pattern passwords and i also don't have a google account, please advice.. Just recently changed my e700 with an lgk10. Used it for more than 2yrs and i can honestly say it was a decent phone though bought it at a premium because about two months after i purchased it the pricing was reduced almost as much by 50%. Anyway the battery life was what made me buy this and was very good last almost 2-3 days when it was new with decent use given that I'm a heavy movie watcher. The last weeks i was using this, battery life still lasts for a day and still outlasts most bnew android phones in the same price range. Other thing i love about it is speaker is located in front and you can play music with display facing up. Things i don't like about it are no after market accessories ( like hard cases) and keeps on breaking micro sd i insert in it. Had to replace it since display is going dark since dropping it very hard one time. Sadly no replacement parts are available here in the Philippines when i had it checked in acer's service centers. Btw, i dropped this phone several times before it gave up on me.. Sanjay, 06 Feb 2017 Thanks for the reply Welcome.

Acer Liquid E700 Trio Smartphone Review. Michael Moser ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 09/07/2014. Android ARM Deal Smartphone Touchscreen. Acer's Liquid E700 Trio features a total of three SIM-card slots. A high-performance quad-core SoC, 2 GB of RAM, and a lush 16 GB of flash memory alongside an HD IPS screen are also part of the bundle. A price of 200 Euros (~$256) is demanded for that. A tasty mix in a restrained casing that will not only be interesting for corporate customers.. For the original German review, see here .. Acer's Liquid Trio doesn't look special at first glance , particularly since many identically equipped smartphones are found in the manufacturer's 200-Euro (~$256) product line. A mid-range quad-core SoC from MediaTek, a 5-inch HD screen, and Android 4.4.2 KitKat - unremarkable up to here. But then, Acer's Liquid E700 Trio does have a unique feature: It can operate three SIM cards at the same time, and it also proves to be quite versatile in other things. Many contenders cannot offer a 16 GB flash memory that can be expanded via a micro-SD card, a lush 2 GB of RAM, and a bright IPS screen either.. Acer's Liquid E700 will have to compete with the Archos 50c Oxygen , iOcean X7S and LG L70 in our test report.. The casing of Acer's Liquid E700 is made of matte-black polycarbonate (Titan Black). The phone is also available in matte red (Burgundy Red). The matte plastic on both the back and the bezel give the review sample a pleasant grip and makes it insusceptible to fingerprints. The smartphone is not exactly compact with a thickness of 9.9 mm and a weight of 156 grams. The contenders are all a bit smaller and lighter. Nevertheless, the review sample is pleasant to hold despite its size of 147.3 x 73 mm, owing to its rounded casing.. Considering the price range, the build is very good and exhibits even gaps. Acer's Liquid E700 passed our compulsory pressure test with flying colors. Both the screen and the removable back cover are very solid and do not produce cracking noises. The non-removable battery , slots for the three micro-SIM cards and for a micro-SD card with a maximum of 64 GB capacity are found underneath the back cover.. Acer equips the Liquid E700 Trio with the MT6582 quad-core SoC from MediaTek. It clocks with a frequency of 1.3 GHz , and an ARM Mali-400 MP2 dual-core graphics core is integrated. A lush 2 GB of working memory supports this array. It is possible to expand the 16 GB internal flash storage (net: 12.43 GB) up to 64 GB via a micro-SD card should it get too tight. Apps can be moved to the micro-SD card providing they allow that. The three micro-SD slots support UMTS ; LTE is, unfortunately, not available. Acer's Liquid E600 with 4G support is to be introduced for this standard. Acer has also installed the compulsory micro-USB 2.0 port and 3.5 mm jack. Both the power and volume buttons function reliably and are easy to reach with one hand. Like in LG's G3 , an additional button is found directly under the rear-facing camera lens. It opens the camera app when pressed longer, and it is also the shutter button. A short pressure opens a predetermined app via the shortcut function.. Praiseworthy: Acer has only modified the latest Android 4.4.2 KitKat operating system very subtly. For example, there is a Float app interface that displays several applications and widgets at the same time. Consequently, there is no need to close one app in order to switch to another when multitasking. Acer also installs a few apps , some of which are useful like Polaris Office 5, a radio app, Facebook or Google's standard bundle. There is barely any bloatware found.. Our review sample supports Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n for local, wireless data transmission. Mobile browsing is available in an adequate speed owing to UMTS/3G. The Wi-Fi reception is decent. A stable connection was still maintained even through several walls and a distance of 10 meters to the router. The combination of tri-SIM operation and quad-band technology makes the smartphone's utilization very flexible. Both GSM quad-band (850/900/1800/1900 MHz) and UMTS quad-band (850/900/1900/2100 MHz) are installed for this purpose. The review sample operates in the GPRS, EDGE, HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA+ net standards with a bandwidth of 21 Mbps / 5.76 Mbps in the UMTS net (download/upload). The A-GPS module does a good job, as the quick localization via the GPS Test app proves.. The phone app corresponds to the. good standard known from Android. The multi-SIM implementation is good and always worked flawlessly. Every SIM is mapped with a specific assignment, such as data connection or domestic / foreign telephony, and thus it is possible to use the smartphone not only for private and business calls with separate cards , but also for an additional data plan. Frequent travelers especially can benefit from the best plan in every individual case. The speech and audio quality ranges between good and very good , and there is only low background noise. Our contact confirmed an impeccable connection in the practical test. The hands-free feature is sufficiently loud.. Acer's Liquid E700 Trio sports an 8.0-megapixel primary camera and a 2 MP webcam. Despite the relatively high resolutions, the camera units do not manage to take particularly focused pictures even in ideal light, and they exhibit image noise. Although the webcam has a dedicated LED flash for shooting selfies in poor light conditions, it ruins the fun of taking pictures due to its poor light capturing ability in conjunction with abysmal image sharpness. The direct comparison shows a quite decent color reproduction but also reveals the massive quality difference.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. Acer puts a modular power supply including a USB cord and a standard in-ear headset in the Liquid E700 Trio's box. It also contains a quick-start guide, warranty card and safety booklet.. Acer includes a 24-month warranty for the Liquid E700 Trio.. The virtual keyboard functions according to the Android standard , which ensures an intuitive and reliable operation. The key field covers approximately one-third of the screen in portrait mode. The keys are large enough for typing faultlessly. The visible area diminishes massively in landscape mode.. The capacitive multi-touchscreen functions reliably and accurately. The automatic screen rotation when changing modes is also implemented quickly.. Acer Liquid E700 Trio: IPS screen with 1280x720 pixels. The 5-inch screen has an HD resolution of 1280x720 pixels. That is standard in this category. The approximately 40 Euros (~$51) more expensive iOcean X7S provides a Full HD resolution. The image is appealing due to the good sharpness, and it shines very bright with an average of 410.8. Only iOcean's X7S is on par in the category comparison; both LG's L70 and Archos' 50c Oxygen have a considerably lower brightness.. 404 cd/m² 436 cd/m² 409 cd/m² 402 cd/m² 433 cd/m² 398 cd/m² 404 cd/m² 422 cd/m² 389 cd/m². 89 % Center on Battery: 433. cd/m²) ΔE Color 10.02 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 8.55 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.46. The illumination of 89% is homogeneous , and both the contrast of 866:1 and black level of 0.5 cd/mÂ² are very decent. Although the contenders have a marginally better illumination, the other rates cannot compete with those of the review sample.. The screen disappoints in the blue range with a clear shift in our measurements with CalMAN. The much too high DeltaE of 10.02 confirms this. The color saturation is also only mixed. The bluish cast then also becomes visible in the grayscale and is obvious in relatively dark parts. The too high color temperature of 8805 K and a DeltaE of 8.55 underline that. The gamma of 2.46 is still the best rate. Fortunately, these considerable shortcomings are barely visible in routine use ; they are only noticed adversely in single-colored, bright contents .. The screen's maximum brightness of. would be high enough for outdoor use even on sunny days. However, the highly reflective glass surface thwarts that to some extent. Nevertheless, it is a good performance compared with the contenders.. The screen in Acer's Liquid E700 Trio uses IPS technology , and thus provides very stable viewing angles. The content first brightens up slightly in very steep angles that are unusual for practical use; colors do not invert.. A quad-core SoC from MediaTek is installed in Acer's Liquid E700 Trio. The MT6582 clocks with 1.3 GHz and an ARM Mali-400 MP2 graphics chip is integrated. The processor convinces with its good application performance and allows using many current apps.. Our synthetic benchmark course confirms the review sample's good performance, which, however, lags behind that of the contenders. Only LG's L70 can usually not keep up. The Androbench 3 storage test verifies that the review sample sports a swift flash memory that outperforms the contenders in virtually all tests, in return.. 3DMark 1280x720 offscreen Ice Storm Unlimited Physics (sort by value) Acer Liquid E700 Trio. 1280x720 offscreen Ice Storm Unlimited Graphics Score (sort by value) Acer Liquid E700 Trio. 1280x720 offscreen Ice Storm Unlimited Score (sort by value) Acer Liquid E700 Trio. 1920x1080 Ice Storm Extreme Physics (sort by value) Acer Liquid E700 Trio. 1920x1080 Ice Storm Extreme Graphics (sort by value) Acer Liquid E700 Trio. 1920x1080 Ice Storm Extreme Score (sort by value) Acer Liquid E700 Trio. 1280x720 Ice Storm Standard Physics (sort by value) Acer Liquid E700 Trio. 1280x720 Ice Storm Standard Graphics (sort by value) Acer Liquid E700 Trio. 1280x720 Ice Storm Standard Score (sort by value) Acer Liquid E700 Trio.

Acer's Liquid E700 Trio presents us with mixed results in the category comparison in the browser-based benchmarks. Although the review sample still clearly lags behind contenders like Archos' 50c Oxygen in the Peacekeeper and SunSpider benchmarks, it surpasses both iOcean's X7S and LG's L70 in Octane V2. The review sample clearly gains ground when a faster browser, such as Google's Chrome, is used. The speedy website setup is appealing in routine browsing operations..

The MP2 version of the Mali-400 GPU has two cores and supplies an impressive performance. Many up-to-date games are no problem although demanding apps only run smoothly in low or medium settings. Acer's Liquid E700 Trio did not exhibit any weaknesses in the games we tested. The accurate and swift control via the touchscreen, position sensor, and accelerometer are appealing. Full HD videos were rendered just as smoothly .. The surface temperatures are always tolerable in practical use. The average temperatures on the smartphones upper side and underside range from 31 Â°C to 32.9 Â°C in idle mode .. The surfaces heat up to 34 to 37.4 Â°C during full load. We measured a maximum rate of 40Â°C on one spot on the underside. The review sample never reached an unpleasant temperature range in practical use. The power supply heated up to approximately 40 Â°C during load, and thus it should not be covered when connected.. 40 °C 35.9 °C 36.3 °C. 40 °C 35.9 °C 39.1 °C. 37.9 °C 35.2 °C 36 °C.

The front-sided speaker produces a satisfactory sound and has a decent maximum volume. As is common for the category, it sounds a bit distorted and somewhat treble-heavy, particularly in higher volumes. The DTS equalizer enables multiple adjustments according to personal preferences and definitely improves the sound. The 3.5 mm jack compels with a low-noise sound and high maximum volume.. The power consumption of Acer's Liquid E700 Trio of 1.2 to 2.2 watts in idle and 3.4 to 2.6 during load is relatively low. Only LG's L70 consumes significantly less in the category comparison. Both Archos' 50c Oxygen and iOcean's X7S need more energy, particularly during load.. Off / Standby 0 / 0.1 Watt Idle 1.2 / 1.9 / 2.2 Watt. Acer's Liquid E700 Trio sports a non-removable. Although the installed SoC is not a power guzzler, the bright IPS screen takes its toll. This can be seen in our two runtime tests. According to the manufacturer, up to 60 days of standby or 24 hours of call time should be possible.. We measured 5 hours and 27 minutes under full load using the Stability Test app and maximum brightness. Thus, it is unrivaled with a one to two hour longer runtime compared with the competition. However, the contenders have considerably smaller batteries.. The practical browsing test via Wi-Fi with an adapted brightness of 30% (150 cd/mÂ²) stopped after 8.5 hours. Alone, that is a good time. However, it is clearly beaten by the competition. Archos' 50c Oxygen is first place with approximately 10 hours; LG's L70 follows with 8:39 hours just before our review sample. Only iOcean's X7S has to be recharged earlier due to roughly 5 hours. It still manages 8 hours with the optional 3000 mAh battery.. It should be possible to easily survive a workday without recharging when the Liquid E700 Trio's brightness is reduced a bit .. In review: Acer Liquid E700 Trio. Acer's Liquid E700 Trio is a decent smartphone for the demanded 200 Euros (~$256, RRP) - but why?. Firstly, the bright and viewing-angle stable, 5-inch IPS screen with an HD resolution is appealing. The casing's immaculate build and high stiffness make a high-quality impression. Admittedly, the device does not offer the best color reproduction, but that is barely if at all noticed in routine use. Also, the application performance is convincing for a mid-range phone. The device reaps in another plus point for using the latest Android 4.4.2. The generous flash memory can be extended via a micro-SD card and even supports the App2SD function that is crucial for many apps. The Wi-Fi reception is decent, the GPS module localizes the phone fairly quickly, and even Bluetooth 4.0 is installed. It's not a matter of course that 3G functions with all three SIM slots. LTE is not available but will allegedly be installed in a similar sister model. The front-sided speaker performs well, and the sound can be enhanced a bit via DTS even if only with the headset jack. The battery runtime is good and is easily enough for a busy workday. The two camera modules' middling performance was not as compelling, although the webcam's LED flash is a small added value.. The biggest pro argument for Acer's Liquid E700 Trio is likely the very well integrated tri-SIM functionality that, unlike many other competing products, does not involve compromises in other areas. Quad-band additionally ensures worldwide use when required. Thus, users with a tight budget who depend on multi-SIM support and do not need LTE will find a reliable and well-equipped partner in Acer's Liquid E700 Trio.. Read all 7 comments / answer.

Acer liquid E700 trio-> update on Android 5.0 lollipop. When we can expect a update to android version 5. for the Acer liquid E700 Trio??. Do you have any information on this? Or even any info on any type of update. This is the problem with Acer! They have beautiful products but they don't advertise them enough. The Acer Liquid E700 Trio triSIM is one of the best mobile phones I've ever had. And its price/specs ratio is one of the best. But Acer hasn't perfected yet a popularity on the huge market for their product.. I can't wait to get a propper Lollipop update yo it!. I hope Acer will consider to give us an official update to Lollipop for our Acer Liquid E700 Trio.. They are cheap and too defective. I have bought already 2 laptop, 1 desktop and 2 phones. Every product had many hardware and software problems.. I will just comment the E 700 that I bought because I liked the tri sim option.. too bad even for a cheap phone.. Slow and slangish even with 2 GB Ram. The signal strength is reniculus low with both 2g/3g.. Slow data speeds with other HSPA+ phones i get double speed.. The first update 1.0.14 had destroyed my phone. I had to do an firmware update. For someone that is not computing literated that is too bad.. Lack of Language support like Greek.. For sure I will not buy again.. For who wants a new and better Acer Tri SIM have a look at Acer Liquid X2.. I've had Samsung S4 and HTC M8 in the past. About 2 months ago I moved over to E700 becuase of the tri-sim.. Simply put, I cant understand how this phone has remained undiscovered by the masses for so!. Excited to see what the X2 will be like.. Top camera photo quality Stock android software with only added changes to do things they do. different like tri-sim Better communication regarding road map update and patches. is a little bit right in the sense that we get even less information regarding patches and future updates comparing with samsung or equivalent, the camera quality is also not so bright, nevertheless acer products are fast, cheap and to the job better than equivalent(ever upper) models from top brands like Samsung.. I’ve the Acer liquid E700 and from time to time it restarts or at least asks for the pin all over again... someone mention that putting them on jeans pocket will do that, probably something regarding pushing the screen or slightly bending the phone, i’ll buy the new Acer Liquid X2 as soon as released, sending the e700 to service repair after a full reset and selling it if it comes back ok.. Acer just needs two or three things. I guess you are one from a few unsatified with Acer products. I heave a Acer laptop, I had an older one in the past and now the Liquid E700 and I heave and had no issues with them. Of course when I bought them I knew the products are mid-range quality so I expected what I paid for.. So don't expect the quality of high-end devices at less than 200 euros. I paid mine 160 euros, so I get alot for this money.... Not jet had time to play with it much. But so far I am impressed.. I bough a acer liquid z4 a few month back for my son. A prepaid thing for just 70 euro's.. I did not expsect much from it for that little money. Just wanted him to have a smart phone to play some simple games, do whats app and take pictures. So far I am amazed by it. Nice display okay pictures (for a 6 year old kid) and pretty fast compared to my old mk16i. I bought it the same time I bought a samsung s2 plus for my wife. Well The samsung display is allready broken (you would exspect a kid to destroy a display sooner than an adult) and when my wife plays candy crush sage on the samsung it often crashes.. So she always plays it on the z4 now. Yes the camera and the display is better but the samung's is hard to charge , the connector is buggy and only works with the original charger with some luck all other cables fail.. So because I the little z4 impressed me much (price/performance) I bought the e700 when I heard of it. Specially the battery time and the 3 sims are my reason to buy it. And yes I know there are many faster phones with better cam's and G4 but hey The thing was only 150 euro!. Though I think it''s a little to big.. But I gues that's supposed to be a feature.. And about the quality? More expensive brand have theire problems too.. I just with it was water proof :-). waning elect your country properly in acer site before downloading any updates.
