( Korean : LG유플러스 ; stylized as LG U + , KRX : 032640 ) is a South Korean cellular carrier owned by LG Corporation , Korea's fourth largest conglomerate [1] and parent company of the LG Electronics. It was formerly known as LG Telecom.. The carrier adopted its current name after the July 2010 merger with another two LG telecommunication subsidiaries, Dacom and Powercom. LG U + offers a variety of mobile services. BankOn is one of the most popular Mobile banking services in South Korea and MusicOn is a music e-store.. After decision of Korea Telecom , the state-owned phone company to sell its cellular business to private investors in 1994, the South Korean government opened the telecommunications sector up to competition. LG entered the wireless communications market in 1996 by acquiring a CDMA license in June and founded a new carrier named LG Telecom, which built a nationwide digital cellular network. In October 1997, PCS cellular service was launched. In March 1998, in an effort to make itself stand out from the bigger, more established players in the market, LG Telecom launched the world's first commercial cdmaOne data service using PCS technology. To better position itself to compete in the bundled services market LG Telecom acquired LG Dacom, a fixed-line communications networks and Internet-related service provider and LG Powercom, one of Korea's largest ISPs. [4] [5] On July 1, 2010, LG Telecom switched to its current name, "LG U + .". As of 2012 LG Uplus customers can receive the services on any of radio frequency band assigned, one or more of radio interfaces. In July 2006, the South Korean government canceled LG Telecom's license for 2.1. GHz W-CDMA bandwidth after the company opted not to develop the technology. LG Telecom will instead continue investing and upgrading in its CDMA2000 EV-DO Rev. In July 2011, LG U+ launched its LTE network, nationwide coverage is expected to be complete by March 2012.. On July 17, 2013 LG Uplus launched LTE-A service with the introduction of the Galaxy S4 LTE-A, the world’s first "100% LTE" smartphone that can utilize data, voice and text with LTE and not fall back to CDMA. Starting from 2014 LG Uplus plans to release only "100% LTE" phones. In 2010 LG Telecom acquired Dacom Corp., a network services firm that operated Hanaro Telecom's fixed line networks. The new affiliate helped LG enter the landline communications market.. Launched in September 2005, U+Home is an optic LAN service that provides fast speeds of up to 100Mbit/s.. U+TV was launched in December 2007, providing various two-way services, terrestrial and HD broadcasting.. After merging LG DACOM in 2010, It was succeeded to LG Uplus one of the largest B2B service area. It is account for about 20% of gross sales by the role of cash-cow. It has not only traditional cable industry, also non-traditional one like electronic payment and so on.. ^ Koichi Kato (April 10, 2014).

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Great value, but a few issues. Style: TV | Size: 55-Inch | Verified Purchase. This is definitely a solid TV, and probably the best value you can get for a 4k TV right now. I'm happy with my purchase, but not totally happy with everything. First, the fact that it sits on two legs instead of a center stand is a little problematic. It requires you to have a TV Console that is at least the width of the TV, if not bigger. We either had to replace our current TV console or purchase a Universal TV stand to make it work in our current setup. Not a huge problem, but a bit annoying that LG doesn't offer a center stand option for this model. Additionally, the two legs make it sit sort of low, so if you plan on placing a soundbar directly in front of it, which you may want with this TV given its average speakers, it might block a thin bottom portion of the screen. For me that's intolerable, so another reason to get a Universal TV stand. The picture quality is great, but it definitely requires some tweaking. The default settings are okay, but I think you get the best experience if you go into "Expert" mode and really customize the settings to your liking. I spent some time on it, and got it to a place I generally like, but it's not perfect for all content. Luckily, you can store multiple configurations, so I found that useful. Since I play PS4 games with this TV, the "TruMotion" setting can really make the experience weird if the framerate of the game is too low, so normally I keep that setting off for game playing. The Dynamic Contract, Dynamic Color and Local Dimming, are cool features, but they can be confusing if you're encountering them for the first time. They do enhance the quality of the picture, but not consistently. I recommend playing with them a bit, to get an understanding of how they work. As other 4k reviewers have noted, 4k content is still pretty limited, so don't expect beautiful 4k clarity everywhere you go. I connected my Retina MacBook Pro via HDMI, which outputs 4k, so I'm able to watch 4k content from there, but otherwise I'm limited to the smart apps on the TV. The Netflix app works pretty well, but their 4k content is still pretty limited. I look forward to the day Apple comes out with a 4k Apple TV, but I'm not really holding my breath on that one. Overall, this is a good buy, and I recommend it. I'd give it five stars if it wasn't for the issues I mentioned above. Compared to other brands, I think this is the best TV you can get for the money. I know there are brands out there like Seiki that will sell TVs dirt cheap, but based on the reviews, it looks like you really get what you pay for. This is my second LG TV, and so far I've been pleased with its performance.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars The Perfect Value If You Can Find It For $500 Or Less. Style: TV | Size: 40-Inch | Verified Purchase. *I am doing this review based not solely on the 4K aspect of the TV, as there is very little to view and review from. Pretty much, you have to buy one of those really expensive 4k media players, or 4K streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Videos. Most people will go with the latter option as that is the more feasible and prolific option. However, they are still limited by their nature - there simply are not enough videos and movies that are mastered in 4K to really see them. Film(celluloid) has roughly the maximum resolution of 8K(~8,000 x 4,000 pixels), so there should be no problem with mastering it to 4K Blu-rays in the future. But for now, they are pretty much converted to 1080p resolution. So you can't really review a 4K TV until there is more evidence. Right now, after trying out the 4K streams from Netflix from my 30MB/s internet service, I can say that 4K movies are only marginally better than their 1080p brethren. So by that nature, it is not a good option if that's what you want to purchase a 4K TV for. Therefore, I am giving 5 stars to this TV for: 1) Price - at the time I bought this, Amazon had a lightning deal for $500, making it into an impulse-buy category. There are cheaper, bigger-sized options from more budget brands like Seiki, but at $500, this is the best 4K deal from a big-name, established, and reliable brand. So if this TV is $600 or more, then I would knock off one star. 2) Computer monitor - this is especially appealing, since WQHD and 4K monitors are way more expensive. There isn't even a 40" option - the biggest for now is 34", and those go for $800+. Although you should not use this TV for gaming, as it can only refresh at most at 60Hz at 4K, it makes a great big-screen monitor for everyday use, for almost half the price. However, you would need a powerful graphics card to ameliorate the refresh problem. I tried 4K resolution for my bedroom Intel i3 ChromeBox, and it was just not having it - too much mouse/screen lag. 3) Versatility - with a regular monitor, you can use it up to 2 devices, if you're lucky: one for the computer, the other for say a Blu-ray player or video game console. But it's rare to have a monitor with more than one input option. I know LG has a few that can, but most only has one HDMI input, or at best, 1 DVI and 1 HDMI. With this TV, you can add up to 3 HDMI devices, plus direct-cable through the coaxial, and any older component/composite devices. So while my living room 65" 4K TV has the cable box, PS4, and my main desktop PC extended screen inputs, this 40" TV has my ChromeBox, Blu-ray player, and Wii U inputs, plus direct-cable. 4) Picture quality - to me, LG is right up there with Samsung in picture quality consistency. TVs, across all models and types (LED, LCD, plasma), have really good picture quality, so that you can rest assure whenever you buy an LG you would get a good image, and this one is no exception. Although 480p/standard definition TV signals are expectedly blurry like most TVs, full HD 1080p picture is superb. Colors, contrast, and brightness are excellent - no complaints so far. It cannot beat my full-array LED Vizio 4K TV, but that is in another price point all-together. 5) Smart features - "smart" TVs used to be really dumb - that is, these "smart features" used to be so slow and laggy that they were not even worth using. You would need to wait a few minutes to even get to the point where you can pick your Netflix movies. So for the longest time, I just used my PS3 to access my streaming apps. But now, TVs use duo-core and quad-core processors to make these smart features easier and quicker than ever to use, so now I can fully give them two thumbs up. It has all the usual popular streaming apps - nothing to complain or nitpick here. 6) Future-proof - you can expect this TV to still be relevant 10 years down the road as technology progresses. You don't have to worry about buying another TV like how you had to when standard definition switched to HD. Cons: 1) As a TV monitor, it cannot beat the color and clarity of my LG 34" 21:9 34UM65 monitor. That monitor is by far my best monitor for PC - the images and color pop out right at you, it is extremely immersive. However, it is 40" 16:9 compared to 34" 21:9, so overall, the TV beats the monitor for everyday use. I use the 21:9 monitor for business work such as photo/video editing, spreadsheets, and when I do research through multiple browser tabs/browsers. And it has it immersive factor when watching certain 21:9 ratio films - this is the standard ratio for most theatre screens. 2) Sound is a bit weak, but more full and immersive than included monitor speakers and cheap PC speakers. 3) Price - for a 4K TV, $500 is a great deal. However, when you really look at it, $500 right now can get you a very good 47"-50" 1080p TV, which you can still use and be relevant 5 years from now. Also, the next big technology is OLED 4K, which you should be able to get a 4K OLED for around this price 5 years from now. So one of the ultimate question is - do you want to take the chance on LED 4K now, or wait out and get something better in the future? You can also stick with the TV you have now, or get a bigger, great-quality 1080p TV for the same price as this 4K one? To me, 40" is only good for 5-7 feet away. Any farther and you'll want a bigger TV. At $500, it is a great deal, and would definitely be recommended. If more than $600, then it really comes to your preference, or what's more important to you right now. If you don't want a good-sized TV that you can also use as a big-screen monitor, then get the 50" 1080p LG or Vizio at the same price. If you want the best quality at the best prices, I would still recommend plasma over anything else. My 50" Samsung plasma I bought in 2008 still had the best picture quality of all my TVs until the day it died 2 months ago. If you want to hold off until better technologies for 4K comes out, like OLED, then regular 1080p LED TVs right now are still a great choice. This TV is good to future-proof your investment 10 years down the line, if the TV even lasts that long.. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Consider it not a smart tv. Update: LEDs went out after 1 year. Style: TV | Size: 60-Inch | Verified Purchase. I was skeptical about making such a large purchase online, was a little dissapointed I did A LOT of research on tvs before finally making the decision to get this LG. I ordered the 60 inch for 899.99 via third party amazon seller "ForU" and was worried about a third party seller. some reviews said their tv came with no remote, no issue there! other reviews say the product came in damaged. mine was in perfect condition and arrived a day before the minimum expected date! the wifi connected flawlessly to my network (at first) and have no problems using "Smartshare" to wirelessly stream media from my pc to my tv. only had it for one day, i will update my review if there are any issues. but so far i could be happier with my purchase. the tv works great and is the best price for a 4k smart tv to date. Update: The LEDs are going out one month after my 1 year warranty was up. looked around online and this is a common problem with these older LG tvs. My tv is/was pretty much always on so under regular use id say the LEDs would last 2 years. it's $300 to get this fixed, give or take $50. luckaly i have a TV savvy friend who is doing all the work for me. though he says its a pretty easy fix and there's youtube videos online on how to do it properly. just be warned that the LEDs are not top notch on lifespan..

Annual LG Texting Championship Ignores the Touchscreen. While the nation's best athletes are in London for the 2012 Olympics , eleven of the nation's best texters are in New York for the sixth annual LG U.S. The competition tests speed and accuracy and the winner will take home $50,000.. LG said there will be a number of rounds in this year's competition, including a text-backwards round (cleverly called the The Txet sdrawkcab round) and a text-in-the-dark round in which contestants are blindfolded.. There's one striking thing about the competition: the competitors will be pounding away on physical keyboards, not on touchscreens. All the competitors have been provided with an LG Optimus Zip, an Android phone with a slide-out physical keyboard. The phone has a touchscreen too.. "Back in 2007 when we started [the competition], smartphones as a category wasn't really prevalent, but the target consumer that LG was interested in was these texters," LG's Director of Trade and Experiential Marketing, Carl Brown, told ABC News. "We built our brand on those QWERTY keyboard devices.". Since 2007, though, that category of messaging phones has been replaced for the most part with all-touchscreen smartphones, including Apple's iPhone and various Android handsets. Fewer and fewer smartphones these days are being made with physical keyboards.. The carrier carries close to 50 touchscreen smartphones. It has only six phones with physical QWERTY keyboards. Even RIM has said its next phone, based on its new BlackBerry 10 operating system , will not have a hardware keyboard, a staple of many of the BlackBerry brand.. LG added a touchscreen round to last year's competition but pulled it this year. "During last year's competition, we integrated a touch screen challenge understanding many are in use today," Brown said. "However, we found contestants had trouble completing the phrases accurately during that round. This year, for consistency and accuracy purposes, we decided to keep with physical QWERTY keyboards.". Austin Wierschke, the defending champion of the competition, said he's happy that the LG Optimus Zip with a physical keyboard is what he gets to use.. "It would take a lot longer to get adjusted to a phone with just a touchscreen and be a lot tougher to pull it off. It works to my advantage that they use keyboarded phones," Weirschke told ABC News.. Most are faster typists with physical keyboards, Wierschke said, and suggested that LG likely continues to go with the keyboard phones for that reason. "That's why they stick with these phones; they can show off how fast we really are.". But some would argue that's not exactly the case anymore as virtual keyboards get more intelligent.. "A lot of people who are into these tactile devices like the benefits of feeling the keys, but now you can use intelligent software with touchscreen keyboards that can allow you to type even faster," Joe Braidwood, the CMO of Swiftkey, told ABC News. Swiftkey is a keyboard app for Android smartphones.. Braidwood said he thinks the competition is outdated and joked that "it's like forcing people to ride push scooters when they could have motor bikes. You can't have a modern day race with an old school device." In 2012, a British woman broke the Guinness World Record for fastest text message ever using Swype, keyboard software similar to Swiftkey. Currently the Guinness World Records has two records for the fastest text message ever sent -- one for a message sent on a touchscreen and one sent on a phone with a physical keyboard.. But while LG says that it will "remain open to considering various options going forward," it isn't letting the lack of a touchscreen round diminish the competition, which is being held tonight in Times Square for everyone to see.. "The thing that surprised us the most is how these contestants really look at texting as a sport. They train for it, they recruit texting buddies," Brown said. Turns out texting is more like the Olympic games than we thought.. Update: Wierschke won for the second year in a row. Ironically, he tweeted about his accomplishment using an iPhone.. In response to ABC News' question about the iPhone Wierschke responded by saying, "I am a big techie. I've used several different phones, but I've found that for the best accuracy and speed, I use an LG device like my LG Doubleplay or the LG Optimus Zip.".
