ZTE Nubia Z17s - Xiaomi Mi6? No, we have not heard about it. The Chinese company ZTE is losing its positions in the international market faster and faster. The controversial models of the low and middle price segments, the flagship smartphones not lacking in minor flaws and a rather weak marketing campaign will deprive the company of profit and popularity if the manufacturer does not rush to eliminate such serious problems. And the hero of today's review would have every chance to improve the situation by his creation, if not one thing.... The design of the novelty practically repeats that of one of the main competitors. It's amazing that there weren't any legal conflicts between corporations about aggressive benchmarking, which borders on open plagiarism. The similar arrangement of the double camera, the same materials of the housing (the combination of glass and metal), verbatim copying the style of the back cover - Xiaomi should think about the behavior of his opponent. In general, the device looks decent, which is largely provided by a 5.2-inches display with extremely thin bezels. The FullHD-panel is created by the OGS-technology and provides excellent image quality both in terms of brightness and contrast, and detailization.. But in terms of a "hardware" the phone is not very impressive. The eight-core Snapdragon 653 processor, 6 gigabytes of RAM and the Adreno 510 video chip we used to see in much cheaper devices. For the smooth functioning of the Android Nougat and modern games on medium-high settings, this bundle is enough, but there is almost no power reserve for the future. 64GB of ROM are expandable with a slot for microSD cards.. 13-megapixel rear photomodules allow to take the gadget to the category of camera phones without a twinge of conscience. Pictures are detailed, saturated, not devoid of natural color rendition. The listed properties has also 16-megapixel front sensors. The battery capacity is not the most record (3200mAh) , the buyer will be able to count on 5-6 hours of active screen time. It is impossible not to mention the support of the OTG, 4G. Thus, the device is suitable for people who want to get a mobile assistant with excellent photographic abilities and attractive appearance. Gamers will have to look for another alternative..
