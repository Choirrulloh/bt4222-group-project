By Kgm Kdg | 14 Jul 2016. Almost one and half year past it Untill now single problem nothing to my handset.... Nowdays Any Smart phone can bought it from showroom or Online Purchase within year any one compliant came and face the problem to the customer. But Nokia maintain the quality No Chance to beat the quality by any brand like samsung sony htc micromax lava gionee. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. By Arkajyoti Misra | 26 Sep 2014. Microsoft finally seem to have got it right. This seems to be a very good phone if the price is kept around 16-17K INR. It has the usual "Nokia Reliability", coupled with the new Windows 8.1 (which is far better than the previous version). It ships with Lumia Denim out of the box, which includes Live Folders(which looks brilliant, constantly showing you all the information you need through the live tiles). It also features a 720P OLED 4.7 inch display which is an upgrade over the previous Lumia 720.. The only downside I can see is its inability to capture 4K videos (Snapdragon 400 can't do that), and the absence of wireless charging (which was present in the Lumia 720). But, it comes with 1GB of RAM, which is better than Lumia720 that had 512MB RAM and yet performed so well with Windows 8. So, expect a very awesome, zippy performance of the OS. Regarding the Windows EcoSystem, the availability of quality apps is on the up, and its turning out to be the best OS in emerging markets. And, it comes with Cortana Beta for India. So expect some awesome conversations with your new phone.. If marketed properly in India, seems like a winner to me!!. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 13 out of 13 people found this review helpful. Best mid range phone that money can buy. By ravikiran dharipuri | 22 Dec 2014. I got the phone 4 days ago, and I am already loving it. I have used high end phones (iPhone 4, Samsung Galaxy sIII), wanted to have a different user experience and thats why I went for a windows phone. The build quality is good, OLED display is amazingingly bright and clear for its price, It comes with basic apps that anyone wants (facebook,whatsap..etc) and the processer does it's job really well while working on multiple apps, no lag at all. All the icons are responsive to a simple touch. with 6.7mp camera, the picture quality is decent. If you are obsessed with Selfies then this is the phone for you. Overall its a good windows phone under 15K. I w'd rfecomment if you care for your money and dont want to spend over 40K for a phone and use it just for facebook, whatsapp and internet. this phone can do all that.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 4 out of 4 people found this review helpful. By Asrarul Haq Ansari | 27 Dec 2017. as it show low rating i am using since 3 years still going strong. Was this review helpful? Yes No. By Kiran Sagar | 6 Dec 2017. even it is almost 2018! iam using this phone for 3years.i like windows phone coz fed up with android.. its HD display, ZEISS camera lens, its weight,.

I purchased the phone because of the 'true' dual sim capability advertised. So far that has been my greatest niggle with the phone because it (randomly) doesn't work. I have two sims, of which one is roaming (from another country) on the same network as my primary sim. When I have both enabled, about 50% of the time, one of them will show no signal, which as logic should tell, is not possible, as both use the same carrier. It's no better when I'm in the other country either. Other highlights include xbox music randomly deciding, around once a day, to turn my music volume down to what it believes it should be, despite my having told it to bog off and let me decide every other day in memory. It also randomly occasionally decides to play songs backwards. Basically a very substandard wrapper for a content store. Not to mention the huge PITA that only supporting MTP for music transfers represents. Coming to this from android I can't believe anyone in their right mind would subject themselves to it. The settings page is an absolute mess, with various settings chucked in randomly with absolutely no discernable method of ordering or grouping evident. Finally, having to activate some idiotic talking assistant just to access 'quiet hours' settings is just plain stupid. Bottom line, having purchased expecting reasonable hardware performance and not receiving such, the rest of the noticeably substandard microsoft environment turns this phone into something slightly less useable than your average $150 chinese MTK effort.

With the recent purchase of Nokia by Microsoft, many have wondered how the Lumia series will hold up without it’s famous name. As the last handset to be released under the Nokia label, does the Nokia 730 go out with a bang or simply fizzle? Let’s check out the reviews!. If you’ve seen a Nokia handset, then you know what to expect from the design of the mid-tier Lumia. Strong lines, clean surfaces and a refined yet minimal approach are something you will either love or hate. Most reviews found the design of the phone to be stellar, with little flex or give in the body and a nice firm grip. Engadget hailed the phone as “one of the most comfortable phones I've held in a while.”. The collection of colored cases available don’t just add visual flair. While the phone looks like a unibody design, the rear cover is removable to allow access to the battery, microSD slot and SIM card slots. The 730 is also a dual SIM model, allowing for greater flexibility. Reviews noted that the covers slide on and off easily, while still holding firmly in place during use. One note mentioned by many reviews is the finish on the orange cover. While the other covers feature a matte finish, the orange uses a gloss finish that is prone to fingerprints and scratches.. The body houses a 4.7-inch, 1,280 x 720 AMOLED screen. Typical of these screens, reviews noted great contrast and color saturation. While not as high as some flagship devices, the screen also features a pixel density that is quite high for the mid-tier market. Nokia’s ClearBlack technology accents the AMOLED display, allowing for improved contrast is sunlight. The technology appears to work well with GSM Arena calling the display “among the best in bright light.”. Powering the phone is Windows Phone 8.1 and a quad-core 1.2GHz Snapdragon processor with 1GB of RAM. All reviews noted that performance with basic tasks was snappy and smooth. Engadget says, “You'd be hard-pressed to tell that this wasn't a flagship just by steering through the basic Windows Phone interface.” Unfortunately, many reviews also noted a lack of power for 3D games or other processor intensive apps. GSM Arena summed up performance well, stating, “offers pleasing performance that would be more than enough for non-power users.”. To store your apps, music and videos, the phone offers 8GB of internal storage. NDTV notes that “Around half of the 8GB of internal storage space is used by system files.” If you plan to use your phone heavily, taking advantage of the microSD card support is almost essential. Fortunately, the phone supports cards up to 128GB in size, allowing for plenty of expansion possibilities.. Marketed as a phone for selfies, the Lumia 730 sports a 5MP front-facing camera with a wide-angle 24mm lens. The rear-facing camera is 6.7MP and offers a LED flash for better shots in low light. Reviews on the camera were average across the board. Many noted a lack of performance in low-light situations unless you’re willing to dig in and tweak camera settings. However, all reviews applauded the included Lumia Camera app for its intuitive controls and wide range of options.. Overall, reviews of the final Nokia handset are positive. While it won’t compete with flagship models, it was never intended to. While it might not do everything, reviews indicate that what it does, it does well. NDTV called it “a perfect mid-range phone” while TechTree summed up the phone best, saying, “It won't top any benchmark tests, but it does offer features that are actually useful.”. The Microsoft Lumia 735 offers a great customizable design and impressive battery life on a budget, but other phones can do more for your money.. Save for a camera that surprises simply by virtue of the fact that it’s not as low-level as the rest of the phone, there isn’t much that’s special about the Lumia 735. The sort of audience this phone is targeting isn’t looking for special. If you're looking for the best combination of low-cost hardware and high-productivity software, the Lumia 735 has you covered in spades..

The Microsoft Lumia 735 is a nice phone for the money, but it’s tough to recommend something that just launched in the U.S. so long after it was released. If it’s a Windows Phone you want, you’d be better off with a Lumia 640 XL for $57 more on AT&T or the Lumia 950, which is coming to AT&T soon, sports Windows 10, and includes flagship specs. It has a bigger 5.7-inch display and a better camera. However, if you’re stuck with Verizon Wireless, the Lumia 735 is your only option for a Windows phone.... The Microsoft Lumia 735 is a nice phone for the money, but it’s tough to recommend something that just launched in the U.S. so long after it was released. If it’s a Windows Phone you want, you’d be better off with a Lumia 640 XL for $57 more on AT&T or the Lumia 950, which is coming to AT&T soon, sports Windows 10, and includes flagship specs. It has a bigger 5.7-inch display and a better camera. However, if you’re stuck with Verizon Wireless, the Lumia 735 is your only option for a Windows phone. Still not sure whether you want to be in the Microsoft ecosystem? There are a few Android phones that have better specs for the same money: The Moto G 2015 is at the top of this list, followed by the HTC Desire 626. These phones offer better specs and more available apps. The other plus is that you can still enjoy all the popular Microsoft apps like Outlook, Office, and even Cortana on these devices as well.. A decent option for those looking for a low- to mid-tier device. Save for a camera that surprises simply by virtue of the fact that it’s not as low-level as the rest of the phone, there isn’t much that’s special about the Lumia 735. The sort of audience this phone is targeting isn’t looking for special. It’s looking for simple, and it’s looking for cheap.... Save for a camera that surprises simply by virtue of the fact that it’s not as low-level as the rest of the phone, there isn’t much that’s special about the Lumia 735. The sort of audience this phone is targeting isn’t looking for special. It’s looking for simple, and it’s looking for cheap. The Lumia 735 manages to fulfill at least one of those criteria; while the Windows Phone OS is pretty straightforward and user friendly, this particular handset could stand to be a little cheaper than its retail price of $300 off-contract. To put this into perspective, I paid only $60 more for the vastly superior – at least from a hardware standpoint – second-generation Moto X, also off-contract. But while you could do better for the price, you could also certainly do worse. Impressive battery life and a decent display put the Lumia 735 above some of the entry-level competition, so don’t completely write it off if you’re in the market for a lower end phone.. Performed well, especially for a mid-range handset. The Lumia 735 from Microsoft is a solid phone. It performs well across the board, and offers a balanced feature set. The hardware is put together well. The attractive screen is sized just right, meaning the 735 is comfortable to hold and use. Call quality on Verizon's network was excellent, data speeds were decent, and the battery did a commendable job. Some people will like that the 735 has a removable battery and supports memory cards..... The Lumia 735 from Microsoft is a solid phone.

Windows Phone 8.1 may not be for everyone, but it’s a fine smartphone platform and covers the basics well. The 735 offers plenty of options for customizing the home screen and other behaviors. Microsoft apps such as Office, OneDrive, OneNote, and Cortana add a lot of value to the 735, and the processor/memory combo kept the 735 humming along swiftly.. A good middle-class smartphone with comprehensive set of features. Microsoft's Nokia Lumia 735 is a very good middle-class smartphone. The phone is ships with an up-to-date OS, offers plenty of performance, supports LTE and features good cameras as well. Although the chassis is made from polycarbonate, the overall as well as the build quality are impressive. The 8 GB of internal storage provide less space than expected, since less than 3 GB are actually usable. At least expansion is easy via a MicroSD card with a capacity of up to 128 GB. Speaking of expectations: the shipping box contains only the power adapter, which is stingy considering the MSRP of 299 Euro (~$340)....

The Nokia Lumia 730 lives up to the promise of being a great phone for those who like to take selfies. It’s not just that, though: with one of the best designs among its peers and an improved camera app it is a good phone overall. On the downside, Windows Phone just does not feel as snappy as Android does on a similar configuration, and you’d see apps loading too long too often. We’re also not perfectly happy with the default display color mode on the Lumia 730, which comes with overblown, unreal colors. Luckily, those who care about accurate colors have the option to fine tune the screen to their liking....

Luckily, those who care about accurate colors have the option to fine tune the screen to their liking. At a price of $320 (€200 in Europe), the market is filled with rival Android phones, though. The Motorola Moto G (2014 edition) is a cheaper phone with a larger, 5” screen that offers the same Snapdragon 400 chip with a much smoother performance, and access to the richer Android ecosystem. Then, if you prefer a larger display, you can get the excellent HTC Desire 816 for around the same price, and you get a 5.5” 720p display, a Snapdragon 400 system chip, and a very capable 8-megapixel camera. Next, if you care about great design, you need to look no further than the iPhone 6-like Blu Vivo Air with its 4.8” 720p AMOLED display, and an equally capable MediaTek chip. Finally, you also have the LG G3 s, a 5” 720p phone with a Snapdragon 400 SoC. It’s a good performer with its physical keys on its back, which adds an interesting twist to usability. If you feel an attraction for Microsoft’s Live Tiles and Windows Phone on the whole, though, and have an affinity for selfies, the Lumia 730 is a device that has more pros than cons. Microsoft is also promising to upgrade it to Windows 10 in the future, so you probably should not be worried about updates as much as someone owning an Android phone would.. Battling it out in the crowded mid-range. The Nokia Lumia 735 is a fairly decent phone that does well in many areas.

The Lumia 735 is well designed, the materials used make the handset feel great in the hand and look nice as well. It doesn't venture far from the standard Lumia design, and as far as I'm concerned that's a good thing because not every mid-range device is tough, dependable and also reasonably stylish. Ideally this handset would be a little slimmer and more compact, but it is what it is.. Just don't call it a selfie phone. Sitting alongside its Lumia 830 stablemate in terms of power, the Nokia Lumia 735 mixes things up in the camera department, making a case for the presence of these two similar devices. Camera performance from both front and back snappers is good, even if the Lumia Selfie app is currently flawed..... Sitting alongside its Lumia 830 stablemate in terms of power, the Nokia Lumia 735 mixes things up in the camera department, making a case for the presence of these two similar devices. Camera performance from both front and back snappers is good, even if the Lumia Selfie app is currently flawed. However, the Lumia 735 is available for just over £200 SIM-free, meaning it's something of a bargain, and if anything raises the question over the value of the Lumia 830. At that price, the performance is fitting - although we daresay that similar spec Android devices are faster for day-to-day operation. The overall result is that the Lumia 735 offers a good size and build, with enough power to hit all the spec essentials. It might not quite elevate itself to excellence, but it's certainly a good mid-range Windows Phone at an attractive price.. The Nokia Lumia 730 Dual SIM is a polished smartphone. We would, in fact, go as far as to state that this phone is the best Windows Phone alternative to the dependable Moto G (2nd Gen). It has a pleasing design, good cameras, consistent overall performance and great battery life. We believe that Microsoft has a winner on its hands with the Lumia 730 Dual SIM.....

It has a pleasing design, good cameras, consistent overall performance and great battery life. We believe that Microsoft has a winner on its hands with the Lumia 730 Dual SIM. For those who are happy with Microsoft's smartphone ecosystem or just getting started with smartphones, the Lumia 730 Dual SIM is a perfect mid-range phone. For people who are already entrenched in Android or iOS or who need a lot of apps, it will take a leap of faith.. Hits the right balance between manageability and screen real estate. Microsoft is doing well to shake things up in the Lumia lineup. A couple of devices shown at IFA in September have hit the shelves and, the software boost courtesy of Lumia Denim aside, the lineup is being updated in the right place. The upgrades are even slightly overdue perhaps - busy adding a tablet and a couple of phablets to the lineup, along with dual-SIM support and cheap screen real estate, Nokia and Microsoft somehow overlooked the midrange.... Microsoft is doing well to shake things up in the Lumia lineup. A couple of devices shown at IFA in September have hit the shelves and, the software boost courtesy of Lumia Denim aside, the lineup is being updated in the right place. The upgrades are even slightly overdue perhaps - busy adding a tablet and a couple of phablets to the lineup, along with dual-SIM support and cheap screen real estate, Nokia and Microsoft somehow overlooked the midrange. The Lumia 720 went nearly two years without an upgrade and it was by no means a phone that deserves such treatment. OK, this maybe just our opinion but we liked the 720 and the Lumia 735 we've just finished reviewing is showing due respect as well. LTE and HD screen resolution look nice on the list of upgrades but the good news don't end there. It's an AMOLED screen now with the ClearBlack technology for great contrast and outdoor legibility. The 5MP wide-angle front cam is perfect for selfies and the 1080p videos are welcome as well. The phone handles great and still looks good, although honestly it's not going to wow onlookers. Well familiar and deliberately understated, it's a design we've seen minor variations of on many Lumia handsets. This is one of the last Lumia phones to carry a Nokia brand and Redmond may be saving the fresh hardware for the ones that have the Microsoft logo. Darn, there are no reviews yet for.

It is protected by the latest Corning Gorilla Glass 3 technology that protects it from bumps and scrapes. Powering this device is a combination of 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 Quad-core processor from Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, 1 GB of RAM and Adreno 305 GPU. Operating system by default is Microsoft Windows 8.1. The camera is one of the phone's best features as it boasts of a primary 6.7 MP unit with Carl Zeiss optics, LED flash and autofocus. Maximum resolution support is 2848 x 2144 pixels. A secondary camera is a front-facing 5 MP unit that can record at 1080p. Additional features include geo-tagging, panorama mode, face detection, etc. Nokia Lumia 730 comes with a default internal storage space of 8 GB, which luckily can be expanded to a staggering 128 GB via microUSB. Connectivity features include many modern day tools such as WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, WiFi Hotspot, Bluetooth v4.0, GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS and 3G connectivity on the fly.

Nokia Lumia 730 is a successor to the brand's flagship device known as Nokia Lumia 830. This phone has been released in Philippines as a mid-range device that will serve the purpose of both casual users and smartphone enthusiasts. Boasting of a stunning HD quality display, high-quality cameras and power configuration on the higher side, this phone will surely grab your attention from the get-go. Let's find out the exact specifications this phone has to offer.. Phone built: The Nokia Lumia 730 is mainly constructed using polycarbonate, and just like every other phone in Lumia series, this too doesn't disappoint. It looks sleek, stylish and comes in attractive colours such as black, white, orange and green. Following a minimalist design language, this phone hits all the right notes to bring attractiveness and utility right into your grasp.. Camera quality: The primary 6.7 Mega pixel Camera is astoundingly good considering that it is not a Pure View camera. It works remarkably well in low light conditions when compared to other phones in Philippines. Under normal circumstances, it takes amazing photos in great details and with accurate colour representation. The secondary camera also scores good marks as it proves to be useful in visual long distance communication. 1080p recording facility adds up as a bonus.. Hardware specifications: Hardware of Nokia Lumia 730 is another redeeming feature as it packs enough punch to fight through most of the resource intensive apps and games. Powered by a 1.2 GHz Quad-core CPU, 1 GB RAM and Adreno graphics, most games like Dead Trigger 2, Asphalt 8 and Nova 3 run like a breeze. Multitasking is also lag-free for most parts as you might experience some delay while switching between apps. Preloaded with Windows 8.1, this phone has security features that are largely missing from most Android based phones.. Storage and battery life: Another magnificent option that adds more value is the maximum storage space of 128 GB! If the need arises, the user may carry along his world in his smart phone by upgrading it from 8 GB. Storing movies, music, games and all your favourite apps has never been easier. The 2200mAh battery is also a great quality of this phone as it recorded to last around 10 hours on video looping test with 50% brightness. For medium usage such as making few calls, browsing the internet or listening to music, the battery should last an entire day.. For the price the phone is offered in Philippines, there is not even a shadow of a doubt that it is indeed a Value for money device that excels in almost everything one could throw at it. The Nokia Lumia 730 looks great, performs great and comes with a price tag which would be a subject of envy among its competitors.. Reviews of Nokia Lumia 730 Dual SIM. User Review : 2 Reviews.

My main requirements when i was buying a new phone were a budget phone with a great battery life and a good camera... Two of my friends are already using this phone and had given me great reviews... So I decided to buy this phone without further thought... I usually prefer buying phones from actual stores but given the price difference and the fact that I trust Amazon I decided to give it a shot... The phone arrived before estimated delivery time and I am in love! Truthfully this is like the last gift Nokia gave it users before closing up - a high-end phone disguised as a budget phone... The camera is awesome - both front and back... Plus the photo editors are great... I was using pixlr in my previous phone but I don't need it now... The sound quality reminds me of the old nokia phones which used to be really nice and loud.. The battery back-up is too good to be true... N with all this come the various Lumia applications which I am still discovering and loving! I had been warned that the app store is very limited but I am not a gaming person so I have found all the apps that I use - except for google chrome... but internet explorer is good too... This phone can give competition to most high end phones out there... My advice is that buy this phone before microsoft realises the pricing mistake :P Review update after 1 month of usage 1 month of usage and I am still in love with this phone... So it's time for a longer review 1. Design - 4.7 inches screen fits well in my hand... It could have been designed to be smaller without the extra space above and below the screen but never mind... The back feels very good and not slippery... I am currently using a case so its protected well. I have even accidentally dropped it twice or thrice and nothing has happened to it... Battery - I love love love the battery life.. It lasts for more than a day with my constant usage - the 3g and wifi are always on and i check my mail, Facebook, instagram, whatsapp on it... N the battery saver mode is very efficient... The phone has remained on for more than an hour on 4 - 6% battery... Camera - Or rather cameras - Both the front and the back camera are awesome and comparable to any high end phone... The colors, clarity and depth are to die for! I keep posting pics and I myself can make out the difference. The back camera app - Lumia camera has some amazing settings - I have tried different shutter speeds, iso, focus and it does make a difference.... Plus the pre installed nokia editing apps make the pictures just stand out... Health & Fitness - So before this i was using a separate step tracker and a gps tracker for my cardio and a diet tracker - But u know what, all that comes neatly wrapped up microsoft's own health & fitness app... So it tells you the number of steps taken; for running you can set it up for distance or time as a goal; it has a calorie counter app as well - which doesn't have as much food items as myfitnesspal app but i m sure it'll improve with time... There's this preinstalled app called mix radio in which u can listen to mixes according to your favourite artists or moods - and these mixes can even be downloaded for offline listening - and the mix gets refreshed every 20 days... Nokia maps and here drive - are much better than google maps! Here drive even tells you if you're speeding! :P 7. The earphones provided with the phone are decent enough... So for anyone who's into gaming I'm not really sure if all of them will be available here... common apps like Facebook, twitter, whatsapp, instagram, medscape are all available though... So really i could go on and on praising this phone.... N u could just keep reading about it... Or u could just buy it and discover it for yourself... Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Good dual SIM phone, but wait for Lumia 735 if you want 4G when it's here.. Brilliant phone with a battery life that outshines almost any Android phone out there. I've been an iOS user, an Android user and a WP user. my first experience with WP was refreshing but it felt incomplete. since WP8.1, the OS has been significantly improved. No Doubt, there are still gaps in the apps available and WP still continues to be a low priority for new features even when it exists. The phone itself looks distinguished, the poly-carbonate back looks like it can't come off but it does and reveals a battery, 2 SIM Slots and a MicroSD slot. the Display is brilliant and touch response is the best. Apps tend to sometimes go into "resuming" or "loading" but that only happens to 3rd party apps, not the core features of the device i.e. phone, people, messaging, settings etc are all fluid and fast. however Whatsapp and other apps including the ones created by Microsoft may take 1-2 seconds to load. My guess is that the apps tend to be cast aside when they are in the background to preserve RAM and CPU cycles. this in turn makes the other apps fast and conserves battery life. App notifications however continue to work seamlessly. My usage of an Android (Samsung S4) was heavy and I would barely get a full day's battery life out of it. Fully charged in the morning - Discharged by 7 PM. with the Lumia, i can easily go from Fully charged in the morning to about 15% battery by next morning. Usage levels are the same, I only use one SIM Good phone but I would wait for the 735 that comes with 4G and be future ready. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Windows 10 finally available!. Windows 10 is finally available for this phone, which makes the experience far smoother. Settings have been organized well in Windows 10. To upgrade, download upgrade advisor from the store. Then it will let you download Windows 10.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Phone for the Elders. A true successor to the outgoing Lumia 720 but it is out of apps, stability of 3rd party apps, and basic features when compared to other products. running Windows 10 Pros: Bright screen and vivid OLED screen Lots of colours for customization (with light and dark themes) good front and rear camera excellent battery good controls in notification bar EXTREMELY LOUD speakers and ear piece plus super sensitive mics option to automatically switch from earpiece to loudspeaker when we move phone away from ear (Works the second you dial or pick a call) Cons: 3G standby on either one of the sims and the other stays only on 2G. Camera has a lot of noise in after 5pm shots music player is a hassle no camera shutter key Why did I get it this late? I bought this for my parents for the bright display, sound, legibility, and top-notch quality.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?.

Like always, this product from Nokia is a real trendsetter in the market. Micosoft Lumia 730 best price in India is around INR 13,500.

Windows 8.1 Carl Zeiss camera lens 1080p video capture Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Less internal storage Average battery life. Nokia Lumia 730/735 review: Golden mean. Microsoft is doing well to shake things up in the Lumia lineup. A couple of devices shown at IFA in September have hit the shelves and, the software boost courtesy of Lumia Denim aside, the lineup is being updated in the right place. The upgrades are even slightly overdue perhaps - busy adding a tablet and a couple of phablets to the lineup, along with dual-SIM support and cheap screen real estate, Nokia and Microsoft somehow overlooked the midrange. LTE and HD screen resolution look nice on the list of upgrades but the good news don't end there.. 4.7" 720p AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Gorilla Glass 3 Microsoft Windows Phone 8.1 with latest Denim update Quad-core 1.2GHz; Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset, 1GB of RAM 6.7MP camera with 1080p. Chipset is rather outdated now No Glance screen functionality A hardware camera shutter key would've been nice You have to choose between LTE or Dual SIM, you can't have both Lumia 730 Dual SIM doesn't have wireless charging support without an extra back cover. Nokia Lumia 730/735 review: more than just a selfie phone. I won't lie: I came into this review worried that the Lumia 735 would lean too hard on the selfie angle at the expense of other features, much like the 720 did. The 735 (and by extension, the 730) is really a capable, stylish budget smartphone that just happens to take some nice self-portraits. Microsoft Mobile has ironed out many of the kinks from the 720 while simultaneously lowering the price.. Good selfie photos Slick design with wireless charging Fast performance for the money. Overall photo quality needs improvement Tiny amount of built-in storage No dedicated camera key. Nokia Lumia 730/735 Reviews: Cheap and cheerful - say cheese. Microsoft's not the only one with a 'selfie phone' now on the market, but this is a solid enough handset with a reasonable price. It all depends on what you want out of your smartphone; if you're not so face-focused, you're probably better off coughing up a bit more for Microsoft's other 'affordable' phone of IFA, the Lumia 830. But camera aside, this is a decent blower for the price, and could attract the cool kids away from other affordable options.. Wireless charging but not possible without an extra back cover. 2.5 + years and running smoothly. Value for money, superb build quality, crisp photos because of Carl Zeis lens. More user friendly and improved performance on upgrading to windows 10. Good call quality though signal drop is frequent. Good call quality [I had extensively used for team calls [onsite and offshore] with min. 4 members on my side and same on other side] 3. Crisp photos because of Carl Zeiss lens (Lumia photo is now tradition in my office) 4. With Windows 10 upgrade memory usage and overall device performance is improved 5. Though app support is limited but majority apps are still available for windows like Gaana, Saavn, Ola, Uber, PAYTM etc... saying so I'm still not a App freak 6. Keypad are very friendly for English and rest other languages (my performance with Devanagari scripts has improved a lot), the same I find quite though with Android OS (especially every version seems to come with different keypad style). Superb build quality, Gorilla glass is amazing, I didn't find the same with my NOKIA 6 8. Devices in Lumia series were really good quality. Better performance degrades after long usage 3. Windows 8 eats up internal memory. Just leaves 500 mb space for other apps to live on device 4. Sometimes device heating issue is there 6. Stays committed to Windows Reboot (Universal fact of windows OS) but frequency is less. Good camera ,Good oled Dispay ,Good battery life and much more. The Best a Man can get... The Last but not the least From Nokia... I am using it from jan @015.. i don't face any problem like heating or else .. its windows platform if you are complaining about apps... i know apss are less, and not all apps are very well and mature but i think they will make it in near future.... its got windows 10 update and is now more beautiful and smart to use.... All(except need of some apps) Enough RAM Enough Memory Sd card support Camera Smooth ui cool notification good battery super game handling good selfie many more..... Display is very cheaper quality broken easily and too much costly around 7000K. If anyone giving it in 7000 then also not worth, I will give -10 if possible... Using since last April and found nothing to complaint about. Very elegant and looks stylish if use without any cover. Camera Battery Built Front camera Ram. Enter each Pro in new line..

[7] All variants of the Lumia 735 are upgradable to Windows 10 Mobile. Many long time users of the phone reported that certain apps like Here Maps and Here Drive have been phased out. As of September 18, 2016, purchasers of a new Nokia Lumia 735, along with Microsoft Insider participants to the Windows 10 mobile environment have reported technology enhancements and software changes creating a compelling handset. While the Here Maps App is missed, it is reported that the Microsoft Maps App is very similar, and works very well with outstanding map graphics. Users also report that both the camera and video capture modes include a 'Pro' function with a myriad of enhancements including HDR for the camera and editing abilities which also works very well with the latest upgrade.

Nokia Lumia 730 Dual SIM Review: Ending on a High Note. Ershad Kaleebullah , 24 November 2014. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Nokia Lumia 730 Dual SIM in pictures. Nostalgia reigns supreme as we start writing this review. Nokia, as a brand, evokes a lot of emotions. For a large number of Indians, their first phones would most likely have been Nokias. We are talking about a brand that transcended all divisions based on social class - rich, poor and middle. A brand that a surprising number of Indians swear by even today. A brand that truly "connected people".. But alas, Nokia's glory days have finally come to an end. Microsoft, the tech major that acquired Nokia's handset division, recently announced the launch of the Microsoft Lumia 535 - the firstsmartphone that isn't preceded by the Nokia tag. The last major launch that we are likely to see from the original company with its own Nokia branding is the Lumia 730 Dual SIM .. This phone is a big upgrade to last year's Lumia 720 ( Review | Pictures ). The mid-range Lumia 730 Dual SIM adds a good mix of features that include a capable processor, sufficient RAM, 6.7-megapixel primary camera, and - its most promoted feature - a 5-megapixel, 24mm wide-angle front camera. Let's find out how the Lumia 730 Dual SIM fares in our tests, and ascertain if Nokia can exit the world stage with its head held high.. Look and feel The Nokia 730 Dual SIM's design is not starkly different from that of its predecessor. It retains the rectangular candybar design and would have looked nondescript but for its funky coloured rear shells. These are available in glossy orange and matte green, white and black.. The engineers managed to fit a 4.7-inch display in a phone that has dimensions of 134.7x68.5x8.7mm, which is great because it keeps the body compact. The girth of 8.7mm notwithstanding, the Lumia 730 Dual SIM actually feels much slimmer in the hand thanks to gentle slope on the rear. It is also pretty light at 130g. We got the green variant for review and its matte rear ensured that the phone didn't feel slippery. The edges are sharp but not to the point that they feel uncomfortable. We would still have preferred it if the edges had been rounded off instead.. The power/wake button and the volume rocker are on the right. There is no dedicated camera shutter button, just like on the Lumia 630 Dual SIM ( Review | Pictures ). This is a bit of a downer for us considering we expect this on Nokia phones. The primary camera on the rear is accompanied by an LED flash, and beside it lies a microphone. The loudspeaker sits on the bottom right corner of the rear. On prying open the rear cover, one can find the battery compartment, two Micro-SIM card slots, and a microSD card slot. The Micro-USB port is bang in the centre of the bottom of the phone, while the 3.5mm jack is on the top. Above the screen one can find the earpiece and front-facing camera.. There is a row of buttons for navigation on-screen, which takes up some real estate. However, Windows Phone 8.1 hides these buttons automatically when an app/game goes full-screen, just like Android 4.4 (KitKat). However, we noticed that bottom portion some apps, such as one called App Social, were cut off because of the bar on the bottom. This could probably be fixed with an update, but it was still jarring (check the screenshot in the software section).. Specifications and software The phone makes use of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 400 quad-core chip clocked at 1.2GHz per core with Adreno 305 graphics. There is 1GB of RAM, which is a welcome change compared to the paltry 512MB on its predecessor. Around half of the 8GB of internal storage space is used by system files. Thankfully, users can add up to 128GB of storage space using a microSD card. Also, there is a 2,200mAh battery powering the phone.. As we mentioned before, the 6.7-megapixel primary camera is accompanied by an LED flash whereas the 5-megapixel front camera has a 24mm wide angle lens. With respect to cellular connectivity, both the SIM cards can connect to 3G networks. The other wireless connectivity options include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v4.0 and NFC. One can also add wireless charging to the lumia 730 Dual SIM with a special back panel. It isn't available in the default panel.. The 4.7-inch OLED screen has a resolution of 720x1280, which translates to a pixel density of 316ppi. This screen is well saturated and the colours just pop. It's been a long time since we've seen such a vibrant screen from Nokia's stable and we are pleasantly surprised. The screen is so bright that you won't face any issues with visibility in sunlight. Even the viewing angles are pretty good, unlike the Nokia Lumia 830 ( Review | Pictures ). All in all, we really like the screen on the Lumia 730 Dual SIM and cannot really find fault with it.. Just like its elder sibling, the Nokia Lumia 830, the Lumia 730 Dual SIM runs the latest Windows Phone 8.1 Denim update. This update adds a ton of camera-related features which we will explore in the camera section. Thanks to the fact that Microsoft doesn't allow companies to tweak its OS, the core experience of using Windows Phone 8.1 on any hardware remains the same. We've spoken at length about this in our reviews of the Nokia Lumia 630 Dual SIM and Lumia 830. We haven't noticed any changes in our time with this device, and we still think that the Action Centre and Cortana are good steps forward for Microsoft.. Similar to the dual-SIM implementation on the Lumia 630 Dual SIM, Microsoft puts two separate tiles for the phone and message functions for each SIM card. This is a pretty flexible approach as it allows users to keep their work and personal lives separate.. There are a ton of additional apps, all of which can thankfully be deleted. These include App Social, BoxTV, Facebook, Flipkart, Flipkart eBooks, Gameloft's GameHub, Health & Fitness, HERE Drive+, HERE Maps, Keek, MixRadio, Myntra, TimesCity and WeChat. Of the aforementioned apps, Keek is a new addition. It is a social network where people can share video status messages instead of regular text updates. Microsoft also provides 1TB of free cloud storage via OneDrive for six months. Users have the option to continue the subscription for Rs. Camera In addition to the default camera app bundled with all Windows Phone devices, Microsoft adds five Lumia-branded apps for capturing photographs and other related functions: Lumia Camera, Lumia Cinemagraph, Lumia Creative Studio, Lumia Selfie and Lumia Storyteller. While we think thisborders on overkill, some users might actually find them all useful. The Lumia Refocus app, which was present in the Lumia 830 and is still one of our favourite apps, is missing in this phone and has been replaced by the Lumia Selfie app. This is big disappointment in the sense that it only offers a self-timer and doesn't do anything that the regular camera app cannot do.. Lumia Camera is basically the Nokia Camera app rebranded, and is functionally identical. Users still get a ton of manual adjustment options and we expect most users to prefer this over the default camera app. Lumia Cinemagraph is, at its most basic, a GIF file creator. Lumia Storyteller uses Nokia's HERE Maps, points of interests, the time and the date to create mini collections of important moments.. (Click for full size) The 6.7-megapixel camera is quite possibly the same hardware that we saw on the Lumia 720 because we faced the same white balance issues in our test shots. We saw a pinkish tinge in a few of our shots. That said, the quality of captured images in daylight is really good otherwise. Despite not being a PureView camera, the lens does a good job of capturing details, that too with noise levels kept at a bare minimum. Overall, the colours were natural and we didn't notice purple fringing around the edges. Unlike quite a few Lumia phones we've used in the past, the Lumia 730 Dual SIM suffers in low-light performance. In our captured shots, the noise levels were very high. The camera can also capture 1080p video and the quality of our test video was really good. We did face some issues with auto-focus but they were few and far between.. (Click for full size) The marketing tag line for the Lumia 730 Dual SIM is 'Made for Selfies'. The 5-megapixel front camera definitely has a wide-angle 24mm lens but after testing it we don't really think that it is the best phone for selfies. We say this because some of test self-portraits lacked depth. It can definitely fit a lot of people into a frame, but we noticed that some of the details were smudged. We are not saying it is a bad camera but it is definitely not the best in business. At the moment, it features third on our list after the Sony Xperia C3 Dual ( Review | Pictures ) and the HTC Desire 816 ( Review | Pictures ).. Performance The Snapdragon 400 SoC under the hood of the phone is fairly powerful and we rarely faced any hiccups in daily use. Casual games work fine but Asphalt 8 lagged intermittently. In our GFXbench test the Adreno 305 GPU managed to earn a score of 7.2fps, which is pretty low. The AnTuTu and WPBench scores were on par with those of the more expensive Lumia 830, which bodes well for the device. The phone logged 11,922 and 241.28 points, respectively, in these tests.. The phone ran our HD (720p) videos just fine but failed to play 1080p videos. The speaker is loud enough for most practical purposes and thankfully the sound doesn't crackle at high volumes. The bundled earphones are comfortable to use and sound pretty decent too. Nokia's phones usually have great sound quality in calls and this hasn't changed with the Lumia 730 Dual SIM. We didn't face any call drops and sound was crystal clear too. In our battery test the phone lasted 12 hours and 44 minutes, which is excellent. One can expect the phone to last at least a day and half with moderate usage.. Verdict The Nokia Lumia 730 Dual SIM is a polished smartphone. We would, in fact, go as far as to state that this phone is the best Windows Phone alternative to the dependable Moto G (Gen 2) ( Review | Pictures ). It has a pleasing design, good cameras, consistent overall performance and great battery life. We believe that Microsoft has a winner on its hands with the Lumia 730 Dual SIM.. For those who are happy with Microsoft's smartphone ecosystem or just getting started with smartphones, the Lumia 730 Dual SIM is a perfect mid-range phone. For people who are already entrenched in Android or iOS or who need a lot of apps, it will take a leap of faith..

I Want To Buy New Mobile But I M Confuse What To Buy Upcoming Nokia 730 Or Blackberry Z10. Windows Mobile Dual Sim Minimum 1gb Ram. I want to buy a non android smartphone under 10000 which >= battery, spec score, screen size regarding this phone.. 1.if somebody new is trying to login thru FB to ur site and if he/she had already opted for expert advice like me and filled the complaint. then if they click on the "Login with Facebook" button then all the description that they have mentioned earlier just vanishes (i.e., they have to write it all again).. Provide some formatting options for the user in this description box which may help users to be more specific to their problems.. Thnx in advance for your expertise, if it's worthy of it?. thanks for the feed back we will work on this.. Also if you want a non android phone one realistic option in this budget is Windows phone and only good phone around the 10k mark is Nokia Lumia 730 Dual Sim. But it does have only a moderate size battery so it should last. a day on moderate use but because its 2200 mah only don't expect stellar battery life.. other than that it has pretty good specs in this price range.. PS: on another note wouldn't really advice getting a low end or mid tier windows phone now since windows 10 is almost out none of these will get the updates might as well go for an android device which is much more future proof in comparison. I want to buy Nokia Lumia 730 mobile. I found that snapdeal is giving at a least price compared to other sites. Please advise me if we can buy mobiles on snapdeal particularly. I had experience with buying electronics in flipkart but have doubt on snapdeal. Snapdeal is a quite reliable website and considered to be one of the top e-commerce portals of the country. Nokia Lumia 730 on the other hand is also a really good model for purchase under this price range.. Please go ahead and buy this device without holding any suspicion in your heart.. Which one is best for me nokia lumia 730 & sony xperiya m2 dual?. Nokia lumia 730 would be a better option in this price range because it is a windows device and there are hardly any other android device which would not lag in this price range.. or some other lumia phones with 1 gb ram. and how is the front and back camera of 730. Nokia Lumia 730 is a decent device and you can definitely go for it.. However as far as front camera is concerned then there is not much difference as compared to other smartphone in the same price range.. The device is good so go for it!! (y). If you are searching for a Nokia Lumia device, which could help you with taking good photos (and especially with the front camera), then the best option will Nokia Lumia 730.. This one is available near the price mark of 15,400 INR and it comes with a Quad Core Processor along with the latest version of Windows Phone Operating System.. Which one is better for me im a average user moto g r lumia 730 dual,even it has got good battery back up tan moto?. Yes, You are right, Nokia Lumia 730 has a better battery backup as compared to Moto G and I must say that if you are an average user then you will love the experience with Lumia devices.. There are really less applications for the Windows Phone users as compared to Android Google Play Store but it has all the important and famous application which an average user uses.. I confused to go to with either ASUS zen fone 5 or moto g2...pls heapl me which one is best?. Taking a look at this comparison, I can clearly state that Moto G will be slightly better in terms of performance as compared to Asus Zenfone 5. Apart from this Moto series has also promised Android L update for the Moto G device, however nothing seems to be done for Asus Zenfone.. Hence my recommendation always stays with the Stock Android smartphone which is Moto G 2nd Generation in this case.. HI HOW ABOUT NOKIA LUMIA 730 DUAL.......?. Nokia Lumia 730 is also a really good option, in this price range. Its life will be even better than Moto G 2nd generation. Mainly because these Windows devices, rarely show any UI Lag.. As i am looking for a phone with good build quality, with good battery backup, nice camera , sound and better display and fast processing.. Nokia Lumia 730 is a better option, because iPhone 4S is out of production now and moreover iOS8 is causing lots of issue on that device.. Apart from this, iOS8 was the last update for this iPhone and from now on, no other upgrade will arrive for this device.. My priorities are batter camera , battery backup. And if it is good for gaming but its not my priorities. As per the requirements mentioned by you, I think its worth waiting for the all new Nokia Lumia 730 because of it good battery backup and great camera.. I will not suggest you to even think of going for Blackberry Z10.. I sorry but u did not said me that why not to buy Blackberry Z10. As every web says it batter phone. BB OS is getting obsolete day by day and so the developers are not giving much importance to this platform. The updates of application are seldom on its Application Store.. Moreover, the camera of this device is really not so good, or I should say that it is not better than Nokia Lumia 730 as per on-paper specs.. will u advice me is there any other phone in 15000 INR as i am in hurry to buy new phone. I am having bit bias-mind with androis phone cause i feel it become slow after some time and i dont use to change my phone very year. I am waiting for ur massage Mr. There come many new Technologies get develop every Year, And its a Trend to buy new smartphones. If you not like to change the phones every Year, Then Go for Lumia 730.. I want to windows mobile with 1gb ram dual sim , good performance. I would suggest that you should not focus much towards the amount of RAM in a Windows smartphone because Windows Phone OS do not require higher RAM to operate efficiently.. You can go for Nokia Lumia 525. It has got the latest version of Windows along with 1 GB RAM (for which you asked for).. More about Nokia Lumia 730 Dual Sim.

Mobiles / Nokia Mobile Phones / Nokia Lumia 730 Price in India. User Visits: 16 Launch Date in India: 06 October, 2014 Compare. Internal storage expansion limit Battery life Cameras Odd screen size. Could use a price cut Nothing different from other Lumia smartphones. Before we start off, we would like to clarify the Lumia range is more identifiable because Nokia name was attached with it. So, even now we would stick to Nokia name instead of Microsoft. That said, the Lumia 730 Dual SIM enters the market and in a space which Moto G has already laid claim to and has taken home as well. How much more does the Lumia 730 dual SIM bring to mid-range smartphone segment is what we are about to find out. The Nokia Lumia 730 dual SIM runs on Windows Phone 8.1 OS and can handle two SIM cards at once. A 1.2GHz quad-core processor with 1GB RAM can be found on the Lumia 730 dual SIM. The Lumia 730 dual SIM has 8GB internal storage and it can be expanded further up to 128GB using a microSD card. A 4.7-inch screen with 1280x720 pixels display resolution can be found on the Nokia Lumia 730 dual SIM. There is a 6.7-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front camera on the Lumia 730 dual SIM. A 2220mAH capacity battery can be found on the Lumia 730 dual SIM and should last for 22 hours of talktime. Nokia may have faded away from the market but the way they built their devices has not and Lumia 730 dual SIM is a proof of that. Now, the package has been given more usability with dual-SIM functionality. The Windows Phone OS might not have made much of a dent in Android and iOS's adoption rate. But make no mistake, the Lumia range of smartphones do not need high specs to outpace their rivals and the Lumia 730 is no exception to this 'exception' that is Windows Phone OS. The build quality is the same as it has been since Lumia series came to exist. The only real alternative to Moto G in the mid-range segment is either the BlackBerry Z10 or, in this case, the Nokia Lumia 730.. Nokia Lumia 730 Price in India. 7,994 .00.
