Canada/China/US/Japan: Adreno 530. Quad HD Super AMOLED 2560×1440 pixel resolution (16:9 aspect ratio ). Rear of Samsung Galaxy Note 7. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (marketed as Samsung Galaxy Note7 ) is a discontinued Android phablet smartphone that was produced and marketed by Samsung Electronics. Unveiled on 2 August 2016, [6] it was officially released on 19 August 2016 as a successor to the Galaxy Note 5. Although it is the sixth main device in the Galaxy Note series , Samsung branded its series number as "7" instead of "6", so that consumers would not perceive it as being inferior to the flagship Samsung Galaxy S7. Its successor, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 , was announced on 23 August 2017.. The Galaxy Note 7 is an evolution of the Galaxy Note 5 that inherited hardware components and improvements from the Galaxy S7, including the restoration of expandable storage and IP68 water resistance, and new features such as a dual-sided curved display, support for high-dynamic-range (HDR) color , improvements to the bundled stylus and new software features which utilize it, an iris recognition system, and a USB-C port. Demand for the Galaxy Note 7 on-launch was high, breaking pre-order records in South Korea and causing international releases to be delayed in some markets due to supply shortages. The Galaxy Note 7 also received positive reviews from critics, praising the quality of its construction, HDR support, as well as its streamlined user interface, although it was panned for its high price and increasing similarities in overall specifications to the main Galaxy S series phones.. On 2 September 2016, Samsung suspended sales of the Galaxy Note 7 and announced an informal recall , after it was found that a manufacturing defect in the phones' batteries had caused some of them to generate excessive heat, resulting in fires. recall was announced on 15 September 2016. [7] [8] Samsung exchanged the affected phones for a new revision, which utilized batteries sourced from a different supplier. However, after reports emerged of incidents where these replacement phones also caught on fire, Samsung recalled the Galaxy Note 7 worldwide on 10 October 2016, and permanently ceased production of the device on 11 October. Due to the recalls, Samsung has issued software updates in some markets that are intended to " eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices ", including restricting battery capacity, and blocking their ability to connect to wireless networks. Samsung has stated that it intends to recycle reusable silicon and components from the recalled models, and release refurbished models "where applicable".. The recall had a major impact on Samsung's business in the third quarter of 2016, with the company projecting that its operating profits would be down by 33% in comparison to the previous quarter. Credit Suisse analysts estimated that Samsung would lose at least US$17 billion in revenue from the production and recall of the Galaxy Note 7. The Note 7 had the shortest life span of any Samsung phone.. In July 2017, 9 months after the Note7 recall, Samsung released a refurbished version of the Galaxy Note 7 called Galaxy Note Fan Edition (marketed as Samsung Galaxy Note FE ). It has a smaller battery of 3200 mAh and is supplied with Android Nougat with Samsung Experience UI, the operating system of the Galaxy S8 .. 4.4 Issues with replacement phones. 4.5 Second recall and subsequent discontinuation. 4.5.1 Disabling of functionality. 6 Note FE ("Fan Edition"). 7.1 Galaxy Note 7. 7.1.1 Samsung Exynos 8890 Models. 7.1.2 Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Models. 7.2 Galaxy Note Fan Edition (FE). 7.2.1 Samsung Exynos 8890 Models. The Galaxy Note 7's hardware is similar in overall specifications and design to the Galaxy S7 , with a metal and glass chassis, IP68 water resistance, and a microSD card slot. [9] The Note 7 is equipped with an octa-core Exynos 8890 system-on-chip in most markets, and 4. In China, Japan, and the United States, the Note 7 uses the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 instead (which supports older CDMA networks that are extensively used by wireless carriers in these markets), [10] [11] [12] Unlike the S7, which uses Exynos chips in this market, Canadian models of the Note 7 also use the Snapdragon 820. [13] The Note 7 uses a USB Type-C port—marking Samsung's first mobile phone with the symmetrical connector. The Galaxy Note 7 features a 5.7 inches (140. mm) 1440p Super AMOLED display. Similarly to the "Edge" models of the S6 and S7, the display curves over the side bezels of the device; the curvature allows the Note 7 to be 2.2 millimetres (0.087. in) narrower than the Galaxy Note 5. [9] The display supports high-dynamic-range video , [16] and is coated in Gorilla Glass 5. [17] As with all Galaxy Note models, the device is supplied with an active stylus branded as "S Pen". The Note 7 stylus supports 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and is water resistant. [9] The Note 7 features the same 12-megapixel rear-facing camera as the S7, [9] with a "Dual Pixel" image sensor and f/1.7 aperture lens. The Galaxy Note 7 also offers an iris recognition system, using a front-facing camera and infrared illumination. The iris scanner can be used for unlocking , and as authentication for other features of the device (such as Samsung Pay and Secure Folder). A fingerprint reader is also embedded in the home button. The Galaxy Note 7 is supplied with Android 6.0 "Marshmallow" and an updated version of Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz user interface and software suite codenamed "Project Grace". It features an "always-on display" mode, which can display a clock and notifications on-screen when the device is not in use; different clock styles and support for notifications from third-party apps was added for the "Grace" version. The Screen off memo feature also leverages this mode, allowing users to write notes on the always-on display. The OS also features several new tools supporting the S Pen stylus, including translation, a screen magnifier , and a GIF recording tool. The previous suite of note-taking apps were also consolidated into a single Samsung Notes app. The Galaxy Note 7 introduces a security feature known as "Secure Folder"; it allows users to create a private workspace, protected by an authentication method, with separate user data and apps that are sandboxed from the main system. Installed apps can be cloned into Secure Folder, and users can designate whether notifications generated by apps in the Secure Folder are displayed from outside it. Secure Folder is based on the Samsung Knox 2.7 technology, which also added the ability for enterprises to control the distribution of system updates, and improvements to mobile device management and Microsoft Exchange Server integration. The device also introduces Samsung Pass, a platform allowing apps to provide biometric authentication using its iris scanner. Samsung reached partnerships with several major U.S. banks to explore the integration of Samsung Pass into their mobile apps. Pre-orders for the Galaxy Note 7 opened the day following its unveiling, with a U.S. [9] [18] Samsung skipped the numbering of the Galaxy Note series directly from " 5 " to "7" to synchronize it with the flagship Galaxy S series , and the Galaxy S7 line. The company stated that consumers may have perceived the Galaxy Note models to be inferior in technology to Galaxy S models because the numbering in their names were one digit lower. Pre-orders in South Korea already broke records with 200,000 plus units pre-ordered within 2 days. [26] Samsung Canada stated that pre-orders in Canada were "outstanding". [27] The demand also forced countries like Malaysia, Netherlands, Russia and Ukraine to delay their releases to September due to shortage in supply. TechRadar complimented that the Galaxy Note 7's "rich-looking, glass-and-metal-fused design" would "really wow people who are upgrading from those old, plastic-clad Note 4 and Note 3 handsets", but noted that the curved edges of the screen infrequently caused minor issues when using the stylus. The display was considered to be vibrant and well-suited for multimedia, especially due to its HDR support. Aspects of the software were also praised, including the continued trimming of Samsung's TouchWiz suite and its streamlined settings interface, and that it already included features introduced to the stock operating system as of Android "Nougat" (although still being initially supplied with Android "Marshmallow"). Of the device's new stylus-oriented features, the consolidated S Notes app, GIF recorder, and always-on display functionality were commended, but the translation tool was considered to be inferior to Google Translate. The Galaxy Note 7's battery was judged as being capable of one-and-a-half days of normal use, and it was noted that the software also featured numerous estimation and power-saving features. Techradar concluded that "If you're going to get out of the stylus, the Note 7 is an obvious choice. The iris scanner doesn't make it a convincing enough buy on its own. Otherwise, save your money and stick with the S7 Edge." [16]. Ars Technica was critical of the Note 7 due to its many similarities to the Galaxy S7. The Note 7's refreshed design was commended for being smoother and more ergonomic than previous Samsung devices with curved screens, although the company was panned for using glass on the rear panel rather than metal. The S Pen was also criticized for feeling "cheap", describing it as a "hollow plastic tube that would feel more at home in a 100-pack of disposable Bic pens than in an ultra-premium $850 smartphone". The iris scanner's implementation was panned for adding additional steps to the process of unlocking the phone in comparison to the fingerprint reader, and that it does not integrate into Android's integrated authentication platforms (making it proprietary to Samsung components). Warnings regarding looking at the sensor for too long were also considered to be "just a little scary". TouchWiz on the Note 7 was panned for consisting mainly of "'different for the sake of being different' changes that don't add much to the software experience", and make the interface less consistent with third-party software by removing elements of Material design language. In conclusion, Ars Technica doubted whether the Galaxy Note series was even necessary anymore due to its increasing similarities to the main Galaxy S line, and felt that the device was priced too high, citing Chinese vendors capable of undercutting the prices of major brands while still producing phones of similar specifications. Galaxy Note 7 security bulletin on a Lynx bus in Orlando, Florida. Battery defects caused many Note 7 units to overheat and combust or explode. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] On 10 October 2016, Samsung permanently discontinued the Galaxy Note 7 due to these repeated incidents. In the original run of devices, the battery, produced by a Samsung subsidiary, [38] contained a design flaw that made electrodes on the top-right of the battery susceptible to bending. This weakened separation between positive and negative tabs of the battery, thus leading to thermal runaway and short circuits. Following an official recall on 12 September 2016, [8] the Galaxy Note 7 was re-versioned using batteries from a third-party supplier. [38] Samsung stated on 23 January 2017 that these batteries had suffered from a manufacturing defect in the welding process, which pushed electrodes up and caused damage to the separation between the positive and negative tabs. Some batteries were also missing insulation tape entirely. Samsung reported that these oversights resulted from the vendor's push to ramp up production of batteries for the replacement phones in order to meet demand. On 31 August 2016, it was reported that Samsung was delaying shipments of the Galaxy Note 7 in some regions to perform "additional tests being conducted for product quality"; this came alongside user reports of batteries exploding while charging. [39] On 1 September 2016, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported that Samsung was preparing to recall the device worldwide due to these battery issues. On 2 September 2016, Samsung suspended sales of the Galaxy Note 7 and announced an informal recall , after it was found that a manufacturing defect in the phones' batteries had caused some of them to generate excessive heat, resulting in fires and explosions. recall was announced on 15 September 2016. [7] [8] Samsung exchanged the affected phones for a new revision, which utilized batteries sourced from a different supplier. However, after reports emerged of incidents where these replacement phones also caught on fire, Samsung recalled the Galaxy Note 7 worldwide on 10 October 2016, and permanently ceased production of the device on 11 October. Due to the recalls, Samsung has issued software updates in some markets that are intended to " eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices ", including restricting battery capacity, and blocking their ability to connect to wireless networks.. A company spokesperson stated that it had received 35 reports of battery failure, which "account for less than 0.1 percent of the entire volume sold". [7] [39] Samsung stated that the hazard was limited to a small fraction of phones manufactured, and released a tool on its website on 19 September to identify affected units by their unique IMEI numbers. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an advisory on 8 September 2016, that passengers should not turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft. [41] The European Aviation Safety Agency made a similar statement on 9 September, stating that "passengers are reminded of the need to inform the cabin crew when a device is damaged, hot, produces smoke, is lost, or falls into the seat structure." [42]. On 12 September 2016, the Galaxy Note 7 was officially recalled in the U.S. by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, who advised all owners to shut down and cease all usage of the device, and return them in exchange for a replacement. [8] On 13 September 2016, Samsung announced in newspaper advertisements that it would release a software patch to the affected Galaxy Note 7 devices in South Korea, which prevents the device from being charged beyond 60% capacity to reduce the risk of combustion. The Galaxy Note 7 was subsequently re-issued with batteries supplied by the Chinese company Amperex Technology Limited (which also serves as the main battery supplier for the iPhone line). [38] These replacement models, which Samsung purportedly [45] [46] classified as being safe, had a prominent marking on their packaging to distinguish them from the first wave of recalled units, [47] and render all software battery indicators with green icons. Samsung was granted special permission by Google to allow this change, as it would normally violate the requirements of the Android Compatibility Definition Document (which must be met to license Google Mobile Services software and Android trademarks) [48] for all status bar icons to only be rendered in white. [49] Following the announcement of the recall, Verizon Wireless released a software update to Galaxy Note 7 units purchased from the carrier, which displays the aforementioned green icons on safe devices, and an embedded recall notice on affected devices when the device is plugged in. Unlike the South Korean update, it does not include a charging cut-off. Samsung reported that 80% of devices had been replaced in South Korea, and roughly 50% in Europe and North America. Only 10% [ not in citation given ] of devices in the U.S. were returned, and about 50,000 devices were traded for a different model. However, Samsung stated that 95% of users chose to maintain their loyalty to the company. In October 2016, several incidents occurred in which replacement Galaxy Note 7 phones still suffered from battery failure and combustion. A Galaxy Note 7 owner in Kentucky was hospitalized with acute bronchitis due to smoke inhalation , after his replacement device caught fire in the early morning of 4 October. The owner told a local television station that he had received a text message not meant for him from a Samsung customer service representative, which read "Just now got this. I can try and slow him down if we think it will matter, or we just let him do what he keeps threatening to do and see if he does it". On 5 October 2016, a flight preparing to depart from Louisville was evacuated prior to takeoff when a passenger's replacement Galaxy Note 7, obtained from an AT&T retail outlet, began smoking and popping as they were turning it off. Samsung stated that they were working with Southwest Airlines to investigate the incident, but stated that they would be unable to confirm whether the device was a replacement model until it was recovered. On 7 October 2016, a third replacement phone in Minnesota had reportedly caught fire in a similar manner. A sign at the Air New Zealand check-in counter in Pudong International Airport warning passengers not to bring Note 7 phones onto the plane.. In response to these incidents involving replacement phones, the United States' five major wireless carriers ( AT&T Mobility and T-Mobile US on 9 October, along with Sprint Corporation , Verizon Wireless , and U.S. Cellular on 10 October) subsequently announced that they would suspend sales of the Galaxy Note 7 until further notice, pending an investigation. On 10 October 2016, Samsung officially announced that it had "[asked] all carrier and retail partners globally to stop sales and exchanges" of the Galaxy Note 7, and urged all owners to power them off and "take advantage of the remedies available, including a refund at their place of purchase". [58] On 11 October 2016, Samsung announced that it would permanently end production of the Galaxy Note 7 in the interest of customer safety. [37] [59] Samsung began issuing special kits to package the devices for returns; they consist of an antistatic bag that the phone is to be inserted into, and three layers of boxes—the last of which is lined with ceramic fibre paper for fire protection. The shipping box also contains instructions explicitly stating that they are not to be shipped by air. [60] Samsung stated to Vice 's Motherboard that it would not repair or refurbish any of the returned phones, and that the company would "safely dispose" of them. Following Samsung's actions, the Rwanda Utilities and Regulatory Authority and the United States ' Consumer Product Safety Commission issued official recalls of all units of the Galaxy Note 7. These recalls ban the sale and distribution of any Galaxy Note 7 phone within these countries. [63] [64] [65] The British Royal Mail and British courier company Parcelforce announced that they would not accept or deliver any parcels containing a Galaxy Note 7. needed ] [67] Online marketplaces eBay and Gumtree also began to pull listings selling Galaxy Note 7 devices. [68] After the suspension of sales, Oculus VR issued an update to its software for the Samsung Gear VR virtual reality headset , which blocks its use with the Galaxy Note 7 for safety reasons. The headset had been included with some units of the phone as a promotional offer. On 14 October 2016, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation 's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration banned the Note 7 from being taken aboard any airline flight, even if powered off. [70] [71] Qantas , Virgin Australia and Singapore Airlines issued similar bans, [72] while Transport Canada issued a notice stating that the Galaxy Note 7 was banned from flights under Special Provision 137 prohibitions, banning the carriage of damaged or defective lithium-ion batteries onto flights. [73] In response to these air travel bans, Samsung announced that it would set up dedicated kiosks at selected airports, to allow travelers to exchange or receive a refund for their Galaxy Note 7 on-site before they depart, rather than having their phone confiscated by security or airport staff. In December 2016, a Virgin America flight from San Francisco to Boston was nearly diverted mid flight after it was discovered that a passenger on the plane had been operating a Wi-Fi hotspot with the SSID "Samsung Galaxy Note7_1097". However, it was later discovered that the hotspot was a hoax, and that no passenger had actually brought a Galaxy Note 7 on board. On 4 November 2016, the New Zealand Telecommunications Forum announced that all Galaxy Note 7 phones would be banned from use on local mobile networks beginning 18 November, enforced via IMEI blacklist. [77] On 30 November 2016, Samsung announced that Galaxy Note 7 devices would be banned from Australian wireless networks effective 15 December 2016. In December 2016, Samsung announced its intent to cripple the functionality of unreturned Galaxy Note 7 phones in Canada and the United States via software updates. In Canada, an update restricted charge capacity, and blocked the phone from connecting to any wireless networks, nor use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. In the United States, the update blocked the devices from being recharged in order to " eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices ". Verizon announced that it would refuse to distribute this update due to the "added risk this could pose to Galaxy Note 7 users that do not have another device to switch to" because it would "make it impossible to contact family, first responders or medical professionals in an emergency situation", especially during the holiday season. On 18 December 2016, Verizon announced that they would be distributing the update on 5 January 2017. [82] Sprint also stated that it would not distribute this update until January 2017. [83] Verizon later announced that it would redirect all outgoing calls (excluding emergency calls) made on unreturned Galaxy Note 7 devices to a service hotline demanding that they be returned, and threatened to charge customers a fee equaling the total retail cost of the phone if they refused to comply. On 9 January 2017, Samsung released another update in South Korea, blocking the device from being charged beyond 15%. On 24 March 2017, Samsung released yet another update for South Korea users, barring charging of the Galaxy Note 7. The Verge criticized Samsung's overall handling of the battery faults and recall, arguing that the company had initially delivered unclear messaging over whether the devices were still safe to use, as well as its slow communication with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission , which had the capacity to issue an official recall in the U.S. The arguments were based on data released on 13 September 2016 by the research firm Apteligent , which stated that Galaxy Note 7 usage had been "almost exactly the same" since the announcement of the exchange program. [87] The Verge also noted that the U.S. government's ban on taking Galaxy Note 7 phones aboard airline flights was "perhaps unprecedented", acknowledging that only the ban of hoverboards by individual airlines for similar reasons—an entire class of products (albeit one that was "admittedly fire-prone because of cheap materials")—came close to a legal ban for a single consumer product in terms of overall magnitude. [70] Kyle Weins of Wired.com felt that Samsung switched to non-removable batteries in order to imitate the industrial design of Apple , after having used removable batteries on many of its past models (such as the Galaxy Note 4 ). He argued that this design decision exacerbated the battery faults of the Note 7, by requiring users to replace the entire phone as opposed to just the battery. He suggested that in the future, Samsung could "lead the pack" by switching back to removable batteries, as with other "responsible" OEMs such as HP Inc. Analysts argued that the recall had hurt Samsung's brand, and would likely cause the company to lose its market share to competitors, including Apple and Google (which had recently unveiled their iPhone 7 and Pixel models), and other Android vendors. [37] [59] Credit Suisse analysts predicted that the recall and discontinuation would cause Samsung to lose nearly US$17 billion in revenue. [89] On 12 October 2016, Samsung revised its earnings forecast for the third quarter of 2016, estimating a 33% drop in operating profits in comparison to the second quarter of 2016, and revenue expectations cut by ₩ 2 trillion to ₩47 trillion (US$41.8 billion). On 18 October 2016, McCuneWright LLP sued Samsung and filed a proposed class-action lawsuit over its handling of the recall, stating that the company had "failed to reimburse consumers for monthly costs associated with owning an unusable Note 7". [91] Samsung was also criticized by customers affected by the exploding phones, who alleged that the company was refusing to compensate them for property damage caused by the explosions. In the wake of the recall, Samsung, as well as UL LLC , Exponent , and TÜV Rheinland performed internal testing and analysis to determine the exact causes of the defects. Samsung released its official findings on 23 January 2017. [93] Concurrently, the company announced that all of its future battery-operated products would become subject to an "enhanced" eight-point inspection and testing protocol, including stricter visual inspections, as well as charge and discharge tests, Total Volatile Organic Compound tests, and accelerated usage tests. An advisory board of academics was also formed. Concerns were also raised over the creation of electronic waste resulting from Samsung's announced plan to destroy all returned phones, rather than recycle and refurbish them into new products. [61] [62] In February 2017, Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung had been considering refurbishing the Galaxy Note 7 into a modified version with lower battery capacity, and targeted toward markets such as Vietnam. A representative of Samsung India denied these reports. [95] Greenpeace disrupted a press conference by Samsung at Mobile World Congress to protest the company's unclear plans for the recalled devices. On 27 March 2017, Samsung announced that it now intends to extract reusable parts such as metal, semiconductors, and cameras from the recalled devices, and market refurbished devices "where applicable". After the discontinuation of the Note 7, some features in the device (such as Samsung Pass, Secure Folder, S Pen related features, and Grace UX) were eventually made available in Marshmallow (e.g. Galaxy A8 (2016) , Galaxy A (2017) series and Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2016)) and Nougat (e.g. Galaxy Note 5 (via software update), Galaxy S8/S8+ and Galaxy C Pro series). In June 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported on Samsung's plan to refurbish its inventory of recalled phones and release them with a new model designation of Galaxy Note FE, with the "FE" referencing "Fan Edition." The phone was also rumored to be named as the Note 7R, with the R referencing "refurbished". This phone was released on the 7th of July in South Korea, with limited availability in other countries to follow, and a price of $610; being a $255 discount from the price of the Note 7. The Fan Edition has a smaller battery of 3200 mAh and multiple safety features. It has a "Fan Edition" logo on the back. The software is identical to that of the S8. It has a similar UI and includes Bixby home and reminders but not the whole Bixby assistant. [99] [100] Samsung introduced an 8-Point battery check after the Note7 to make sure all of their batteries are safe for new and current devices in production. There have been no reported incidents of an S8/S8+ catching fire after their release as the first new flagship device to go through the 8-Point battery check. There have been no reported incidents of the successor Note8 catching fire either. After the Fan Edition has launched in South Korea , the Galaxy Note FE has also been launched in selected countries in Asia and Saudi Arabia starting from October 2017. As of December 2017, there is no word on the Note FE being released to other countries.. ^ "Samsung Galaxy Note7 Teardown". Retrieved 22 October 2016. ^ "Samsung Galaxy Note Fan Edition Teardown".

Samsung has officially ceased production of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 after several users reported self-destructing batteries that posed serious safety concerns.. Expert Review User reviews. Samsung phones are some of the best phones on the market right now, and the new Samsung Galaxy Note7 will lead the popularity contest when it is released. The Galaxy Note line has been a tried and true member of the Samsung family, and the Galaxy Note7 lives up to the expectations set forth by previous models in this line. Taking a look at the specs, there are not a whole lot of changes from the previous version of this line, the Galaxy Note5, but there are some features that set it apart. What makes the Samsung Galaxy Note7 stand out from the rest of the phones on the market?. The design of the Galaxy Note7 has been redesigned to be completely symmetrical, unlike its predecessor. The best way to see this symmetrical design is to look at it from a side point of view, especially when the curved back is taken into account. In addition, this model has been designed to be smaller than the Galaxy Note5; in fact, the width of the phone has been decreased by about three millimeters, and the other dimensions have remained roughly the same. It also weights slightly less, but only about two grams.. The display on the Galaxy Note7 features an edge display that is more aesthetically pleasing. The screen is comprised of Gorilla Glass 5, which is extremely durable, but it may not resist against all micro-abrasions, so covering the screen may still be best. The curve of the screen has been modified to imitate the Galaxy S7 Edge, which makes the viewing angles that are available to experience truly amazing. When it comes to performance, there are only slight changes to take note of. The most unique one is a new HDR display mode. While looking at the screen in this mode, the brightness is capable of reaching 600 nits for brief periods of time. This mode may only be available for some of the video apps on the phone, but this level of brightness exceeds the outdoor brightness boost, which is only 500 nits.. The battery that is included in this phone is slightly smaller than the previous phones in this line; in fact, it is only a 13.48 WHr battery. The main reason for this change is that many of the Samsung customers who are loyal to this line of phones have expressed a desire to have a smaller device that is still able to have a large screen, so to try and stay in tune with what people want their phones to look like, Samsung decided to go with the reduced battery capacity. Having a battery upgrade of 15 WHr would most likely require the phone to have a slightly larger design. To help offset the smaller battery, the Galaxy Note7 has been fitted with a USB type C port, which offers faster download speeds of at least ten gigabytes per second as well as built-in quick charging functionality. One of the most unique features of this port is that it is designed to be completely round, which means that the wire can be inserted in either direction and it will still be able to charge.. The S-Pen in the Galaxy Note7 has been completely redesigned. The tip of the pen is actually only 0.7 millimeters, which is actually a lot smaller that the pen tip of the S-Pen of previous versions. In addition, to this smaller profile, the pen tip also features a higher sensitivity level, one that is almost double what it was on the Galaxy Note5. This feature is great for anyone who likes to draw or create art on their phones, as the smaller point allows more detailed art creations. In addition, users can now also place the S-Pen in the phone backwards without it ruining your phone, so if for some reason the desire to resist is too strong, the phone will no longer suffer the consequences. In addition, the S-Pen uses Wacom magnetic resonance tech that allows it to retain its sensitivity and accuracy levels while wet, so even using this functionality while taking a bubble bath or relaxing on the beach is easily possible.. There have been quite a number of software revisions with the Note7, which start with a new version of TouchWiz that is designed to improve the icons and their overall aesthetic design. Samsung has included the ability to create secure folders that can only be accessed via fingerprint authentication or the new iris authentication system, which is new to the Note7. To utilize this functionality, one must hold the screen ten to 14 inches from the iris or eye. The scanner will then use infrared light to perform a scan and make sure the correct individual is accessing the phone. Glasses will not be required to be removed during this process, but it is recommended. Since this is a relatively new functionality on phones, the frame rate while scanning is somewhat low. In addition, only one set of eyes can be registered to the device.. Another software feature of note involves the S-Pen. Using this device, videos can easily be turned into GIFs, which can be a unique feature to use, but Samsung has indicated that it will only be available for use with non-DRM videos. The S-Pen is also able to translate text into nearly any language, which can be useful for taking notes. To improve the experience of the users, Samsung has combined the entire library of previous note taking applications into one application that is easy to use and still provide access to the majority of the same features.. Of course a phone is not purchased based on the accessories, but knowing what is included in the packaging can only make it more of a tempting purchase to make. To make it more convenient to charge the Galaxy Note7 on the go, Samsung has included a wireless charging case that is IP68 compatible. An S view standing cover is also included in the packaging to help protect the phone as well as provide an easy method of watching videos. The cover props the phone up in an easy-to-view angle that will not require the user to hold the device, which is a functionality that is enjoyed by many individuals.. If the display on the Samsung S7 Edge was tempting, but switching from the Galaxy Note line was too much to bear, then Samsung has come up with a solution that is a great combination of the two lines. The Galaxy Note7 has a large screen, an S-Pen, and software updates that are unbelievable upgrades. It can be purchased in three different color variations, which are Black Onyx, Blue Onyx, and Silver Titanium. With all of the improvements from the previous phone in this line, any avid Galaxy Note user will be ecstatic to make this upgrade.. Get $200 off Galaxy 8 or Galaxy 8+.

The Galaxy Note smartphones have been considered the first commercially successful examples of " phablets "—a class of smartphone with large screens that are intended to straddle the functionality of a traditional tablet with that of a phone. Samsung sold over 50 million Galaxy Note devices between September 2011 and October 2013. 10 million units of the Galaxy Note 3 have been sold within its first 2 months, 30 million were of the Note II, while the original Galaxy Note sold around 10 million units worldwide.. 1.1.2 Galaxy Note II. 1.1.3 Galaxy Note 3. 1.1.4 Galaxy Note 3 Neo. 1.1.5 Galaxy Note 4. 1.1.6 Galaxy Note Edge. 1.1.7 Galaxy Note 5. 1.1.8 Galaxy Note 7. 1.1.9 Galaxy Note Fan Edition (FE). 1.1.10 Galaxy Note 8. 1.2.1 Samsung Galaxy Note. 1.2.1.1 Galaxy Note 7.0. 1.2.1.2 Galaxy Note 10.1. 1.2.1.3 Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition. 1.2.2 Samsung Galaxy Note Pro. 1.2.2.1 Galaxy Note Pro 12.2. 2 Other Samsung Devices equipped with S-Pen stylus. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note (original). At IFA Berlin in 2011, Samsung announced the original Galaxy Note. While some media outlets questioned the viability of the device due to its 5.3-inch (135-mm) screen (which was, at the time, considered extremely large for a phone), the Note received positive reception for its stylus functionality, the speed of its 1.4. GHz dual-core processor, and the advantages of such a large screen size. [1] [2] The Galaxy Note was a commercial success: released October 2011, Samsung announced in December 2011, that the Galaxy Note had sold 1 million units in two months. In February 2012, Samsung debuted a Note version with LTE support, and by August 2012, the Note had sold 10 million units worldwide. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note II. On August 29, 2012, at IFA Berlin, Samsung unveiled a successor to the Galaxy Note, the Galaxy Note II. The new model, released September 2012, featured improvements to the original Note's hardware (with a quad-core processor and a larger 5.5 inches (140. mm) display, a revised stylus and an upgraded digitizer with 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity for more precise pen input, a new hardware design based on that of the Galaxy S III ), along with new features such as pen gestures, split-screen multitasking, Air View (which allows previews of content to be displayed by hovering the pen above the screen), and other new features also introduced by the S III. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. On September 4, 2013, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 3, which introduced a more "premium" design with a plastic leather backing, a 5.7 inch (145. mm) 1080p display, up to 5 minutes of 4K video recording, USB 3.0 connector, and expanded stylus pen functionality. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo. In January 2014, Samsung for the first time released a "downgraded" version of the Note 3, the Galaxy Note 3 Neo. It features the S-Pen stylus, 8. MP camera, 5.5" Super AMOLED HD 720p display, 16. GB RAM as well as all of the Note 3's software features. For the first time, it has a Samsung Exynos Hexa 5260 (6 core) processor with a quad core 1.3. GHz Cortex A7 CPU and a dual core 1.7. GHz Cortex A15 CPU with support for HMP and a Mali-T624 GPU.. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note 4. On September 3, 2014, at IFA Berlin, Samsung unveiled a successor to the Galaxy Note 3, the Galaxy Note 4. The new model, released October 2014, introduced a new design with a plastic leather backing and metal frame, a 5.7-inch (145. MP camera with OIS , improved S-Pen stylus, an upgraded digitizer with 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity and expanded functionality, fingerprint scanner, and other features taken from the Galaxy S5 .. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note Edge. Alongside the Galaxy Note 4, Samsung also unveiled the Galaxy Note Edge, which features a display with a curved portion that wraps around the right bezel of the device. The curved area can be used as a sidebar to display news and information tickers, application shortcuts, and other tools. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note 5. The Galaxy Note 5 was announced on 13 August 2015. It is based upon the specifications and hardware design of the Galaxy S6 , including its metal frame and glass backing, a 5.7-inch 1440p display, Exynos 7 Octa 7420 system-on-chip , as well as a new spring-loaded stylus slot. As with the S6 and unlike previous Note models, the Note 5 does not offer a user-replaceable battery or expandable storage. [10] [11] [12] [13] The new "Screen off memo" feature allows the phone to be awoken directly to a note screen when the stylus is removed, [10] and the camera app allows public and private livestreaming directly to YouTube. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note 7. The Galaxy Note 7 was announced during a press event in New York City on 2 August 2016. [14] It is largely based on the hardware of the Galaxy S7 , inheriting its processor, camera, and the restoration of IP68 water resistance and expandable storage. It is also Samsung's first device to feature a USB-C connector. The Galaxy Note 7's display is curved across the sides of the device, and its stylus features higher degrees of pressure sensitivity and a finer tip. [15] [16] Samsung branded the device as the Note 7 rather than 6 in order to synchronize its branding with the flagship Samsung Galaxy S7. The Galaxy Note 7 was afflicted by repeated manufacturing problems with their internal batteries, which led to incidents in which they overheated and combusted. [18] [19] After replacement models experienced similar incidents, the Note 7 was officially discontinued on 11 October 2016, and all devices were recalled globally. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note FE. After the recall of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, Samsung decided to release the Note Fan Edition (FE) as the new Note 7 being released in selected countries on July 7, 2017. It comes with a smaller battery than the Note 7 due to safety reasons. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note 8. The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 was announced on 23 August 2017 at a Samsung Unpacked event. It features a 6.3" 1440p Super AMOLED Infinity Display , Snapdragon 835 / Exynos 8895 processor (depending on location), an iris scanner , IP68 dust and water resistance, a new dual-lens camera setup with a telephoto lens and support for Samsung DeX .. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0. At the Mobile World Congress 2012 , Samsung announced the Galaxy Note 7.0. It has an 7-inch display and uses a quad-core 1.6. GHz processor and, like the Galaxy Note 10.1, supports the Samsung S-Pen stylus.. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. At the Mobile World Congress 2012, Samsung announced the Galaxy Note 10.1, as an alternative to the Galaxy Tab 10.1. It has a 10.1-inch display and uses a quad-core 1.4. GHz processor and supports the Samsung S-Pen stylus input as seen on the original Galaxy Note phone.. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition. At the 2013 Samsung Unpacked Episode 2 event in Berlin and New York, Samsung announced the successor to the original Galaxy Note 10.1 inch tablet dubbed as the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition. Like its predecessor, it has a 10.1 inch display and now supports the improved Samsung S-Pen stylus input also seen in the Note III and it copies the design cue of its lower-end sibling the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 which sports the unified Samsung design first used on the Samsung Galaxy S4 .. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2. At the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Samsung announced the first Pro line of tablets which included a bigger Samsung Galaxy Note Pro tablet with a 12.2 inch display and also comes with the same S-Pen stylus the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is sporting which is the standard on the Note Series. Its design is similar to the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition which has the Samsung standard simulated stitched-leather back.. Main article: Samsung Galaxy Tab series. Subsequently, released together with the first regular Tab A 8.0 and 9.7 models in 2015, Samsung released a model of the Tab A 9.7 equipped with an S-Pen stylus making it the first Samsung Galaxy device to be equipped with the Samsung stylus outside the Note series. In 2017 Samsung released another S-Pen device, the Tab S3.. This table is primarily intended to show the differences between the model families of the Galaxy Note series.

CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 has an eye-catching design and high-end hardware, and it takes great outdoor photos. Using the stylus has never felt better and battery life is terrific.. The Bad With a nonremovable battery and no external storage option, the Note 5 strips away some of last year's features. It's pricey compared with large-screen competitors like Motorola's Moto X Pure.. The Bottom Line Samsung's Galaxy Note 5 is excellent overall, and the only phone to buy if you want to write by hand. However, you'll pay a huge premium for a modest upgrade from last year's model, and less pricey competitors will satisfy many.. Fall '16 update Premium phone, premium price Behold, a Note evolution! (Top, from left to right: Note, Note 2, Note 3; bottom, from left to right: Note 4, Note Edge, Note 5).

In August, Samsung released the Galaxy Note 7, its follow-up to the Galaxy Note 5, to favorable reviews. With its head-turning design, precise stylus and brilliant screen, it shored up the Note 5's few weaknesses, and was praised as Samsung's ultimate phone. Until the devices started overheating and, in some cases, catching fire.. After a botched recall and some very negative publicity, in September Samsung stopped production of the Galaxy Note 7. The company earlier had asked carriers around the world to suspend sales of the phone. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has gone further, saying, "Consumers should power down and stop using all Galaxy Note 7s.". Our advice: Don't buy a Galaxy Note 7, even if you can still find one. And if you already own one, you should immediately turn it off and exchange it for a phone that isn't a Note 7. All US cellular carriers and Best Buy (among others) will exchange your Note 7 for phones of equal value on the same network. Similar schemes apply in the UK and Australia.. The Galaxy Note 5, which Samsung still sells, however, remains a solid, reliable and nonexplosive phone. Though it doesn't have all of this year's hardware or software enhancements, it features a great camera, a terrific stylus and extensive battery life. And it is safe to own and use.. In fact, there is no shortage of terrific alternatives. Apple has released its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus , which take great photos, provide long battery life and deliver fast performance, though they lack some of the Galaxy Note 7's cutting-edge features such as an iris scanner and wireless charging. Google recently released its Pixel phone. And there is Samsung's own Galaxy S7 Edge , which is the most similar to the Note 7, just without the stylus.. Editors' note: The original Samsung Galaxy Note 5 review , first published in August 2015 and updated since, follows.. The Galaxy Note 5 is available in gold, silver, white and sapphire black (which looks blue in the light), though not every region carries every color. Prices vary by retailer and country; be sure to check current promotions before you buy.. There's no denying that the Note 5 costs a lot, though it varies depending on where you live and where you buy it. That noted, as of October 2015, the 64GB version costs roughly $800 and the 32GB model costs about $700, making the Note 5 more expensive than the $649 64GB iPhone 6 Plus and the $749 64GB 6S Plus. The Note 5 is cheaper than the S6 Edge+, however; you'll pay even more for that curved display.. Compared to other large-screen models, like the 5.5-inch LG G4. Pure, the Note 5 is straight-up pricey.. In the US, the Note 5 comes in black and white (but not gold or silver) for AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular and Verizon.. AT&T : Full retail: $740 (32GB) or $840 (64GB). Next 24 (30 monthly payments): $0 down plus $24.67 (32GB) or $28 (64GB). Next 18 (24 monthly payments): $0 plus $30.84 (32GB) or $35 (64GB). Next 12 (20 monthly payments): $37 (32GB) or $42 (64GB).. Sprint : Full retail: $720 (32GB) or $816 (64GB). Two-year service agreement: $250 (32GB) or $350 (64GB). Lease program (24 months): $0 down and $25 (32GB) or $30 (64GB) per month. Easy Pay (24 months): $0 down and $30 (32GB) or $34 (64GB) per month.. T-Mobile : Full retail: $700 (32GB) or $780 (64GB). 24 monthly payments: $0 down and $29.17 (32GB) or $99 down and $28.33 (64GB).. Verizon : Full retail: $696 (32GB) or $792 (64GB). 24 monthly payments: $29 (32GB) or $33 (64GB).. US Cellular: Full retail: $670 (32GB) or $770 (64GB). Two-year contract: $200 (32GB) or $300 (64GB). 20 monthly payments: $0 down and $33.45 (32GB) or $38.46 (64GB).. Like the Galaxy S6, the Note 5 has straight sides and a flat face but also the Edge+'s frontal curves along the back. From what I can tell holding them side by side, the curves are the same. Checking out its profile, these comfortable rear arcs cause the Note 5's top and bottom edges to flare out thicker than its middle. It'll still fill your hand -- this is a large device -- but the overall sensation is still of slimness, especially compared with the relatively bulky Note 4.. Although that AMOLED display still measures 5.7 inches, Samsung has shaved down the Note 5's dimensions, making the handset feel overall sleeker and slimmer than last year's Note 4. That's good news for one-handed phone jockeys, who get the same screen real estate in a more streamlined package. The 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution (515 pixels per inch) holds steady from last year, lending a lot of crisp detail to the screen, possibly even more than we strictly need.. Below the display, the usual two soft keys (recent apps and back) sandwich the physical home button, which also serves as the phone's fingerprint reader and Google Now call-up (press and hold for Google Now, the search giant's voice-command answer to Apple's Siri). You'll find the power/lock button on the right and volume rocker on the left. Along the bottom are the standard Micro-USB charger (alas,. not USB-C as we had hoped ), headset jacks and S Pen holster, with the SIM card tray up top.. On the flipside, you'll see the 16-megapixel camera lens, flash and heart rate reader. A unibody device, it has no removable backplate or battery and you won't find an expandable storage slot anywhere. Prepare for your smudgy fingerprints to bloom all over that mirrored surface, and keep a microfiber cloth nearby.. One last, infuriating thing I've noticed in all these years of testing: That power/lock button on the right likes to turn itself on in my purse's interior phone pocket, draining battery willy-nilly. I keep hoping Samsung will work this out, but so far no dice.. The Note S Pen stylus, which is made of polycarbonate plastic, changes a little bit every year. This time around, the stylus audibly clicks into place inside the Note 5's chute like the crown of a retractable pen. It's kind of fun, but the fit is so snug, you have to really tease it out. The plastic pen has long, flat planes to keep it from rolling away on a tabletop. Its single button slightly recesses from the surface to tone down the mispresses, which I've found common in previous S Pen designs.. Important tip: That S Pen can only be inserted in the holder pointy end first. It is not meant to holster on the non-business end. If you try that, bad things will happen , as some users report when their S Pens got stuck with the square end wedged, possibly irretrievably, deep inside the phone.. The S Pen continues to act as a writing implement, pointer and navigational accomplice. You can use it to pull up a menu dialog box, or hover to pull up photo or video preview. It also works with those touch-sensitive menu buttons and the physical home button. Dragging and dropping text, and capturing the screen are two other tricks.. Samsung claims that its pen writes a lot better this time around, more fluidly, and with decreased latency times. I didn't notice that, even writing with the same pen and ink "weight" on the Note 5 and Note 4 side by side. I did notice that the 5's S Pen feels a touch lighter, which made for slightly cleaner, easier writing, compared with the Note 4's slightly heavier pen. My handwriting is still barely legible on both.. The S Note app itself is greatly simplified, with extra features tucked into the More menu. You can also download a ton more tools, like a chart helper and an extension pack that includes advanced tricks like a heartier toolbar and shape recognition, handwriting "transformation" and the ability to record sketches.. In the app itself, you can customize everything from the way you select color to the way you save favorite combinations of pen tips and ink thickness. As with previous versions, the pen stays sensitive along the corners of the page, and onscreen controls will momentarily disappear so you can continue to write and draw "below" them.. Compared with 2014's Galaxy Note 4, the new Note 5 has some additional tricks up its sleeve.. Redesigned shortcuts wheel : Called Air Command, this floating icon hangs out on any screen and opens up to reveal a circular menu of most frequently used apps -- say, the S Note app, the browser or your photo gallery. It's always on by default, but you can turn that off in Settings. You can also customize this by adding up to three apps of your choice.. Air Command responds faster these days, which means that if you accidentally click the S Pen button, you can quickly click again to dismiss it without too much interruption. The floating icon doesn't get much in the way, because it only interacts if you tap or click with the S Pen, not your finger.. Instant memo : Called "screen off memo" in the settings, this feature lets you create an "action memo" (more like a sticky note) even when the screen is turned off. One caveat: it works only just after pulling out the S Pen, not if the pen has been out for a while. I like this feature -- it adds to the S Pen's ability to really quickly jot a note. You'll need to dip into the settings to toggle it on.. PDF writing : Yep, you can now annotate PDFs by handwriting all over them, just as you can do with a screenshot.. Scrolling capture : Instead of taking several screenshots of a long piece of text, the Note 5 will prompt you to capture more of the whole screen. You'll be able to annotate right on the screenshot too, of course.. The Galaxy Note 5 runs Android 5.1 Lollipop , bolstered by Samsung's own TouchWiz layer. That means the phone will be able to tie in to Google's wide array of services, such as Google Now, turn-by-turn navigation and access to Google Drive files. But it can also tap into Samsung's own software, all of which customizes the display's look and feel -- like those quick-access toggles in the notifications shade and anything that has to do with the S Pen. Microsoft's One Drive cloud storage app is also onboard (more on this below).. Alas, while Android 6.0 Marshmallow. is just around the corner, its due date to these new Samsung phones is anyone's guess. With the exception of promised monthly security updates , more substantive software updates are on a notoriously slow boat .. In addition, Samsung's apps include Note mainstays like S Note and S Health, though the company has really pulled back on its preloaded apps. You'll find a cornucopia of optional add-ons tucked away in various spots throughout the phone, like Galaxy Gifts and Galaxy Essentials.. A quick skip through the settings menu turns up a whole bushel of extra modes and options, like a simplified home screen (Easy mode) and a vault for photos and files you don't want anyone else to see (Private mode). There are also two levels of battery-saver, several gestures and some themes to freshen up the look and feel. You'll even find a user manual.. Likewise, pull down the notifications shade for quick-access settings, including a flashlight. You can edit to reorder these. From the home page, swipe right to reveal Flipboard, which you can use to read headline news about your pet topics.. If you look at the megapixel count alone, not much has changed with the Note 5's camera. Samsung has adopted a wider aperture lens (f1.9 instead of the Note 4's f2.2), the same one that's used in the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Why is this "good"? A bigger aperture lets in more light, and more light leads to better photos, specifically low-light pictures. The image-processing capabilities make a huge difference too, of course, but the bottom line is that the overall photo quality should incrementally improve from the Note 4, and is on par with that of the S6 and S6 Edge.. The phone also gets a few more editing and shooting modes and guides -- little things, mostly, but these are always fun to discover.. As with the Galaxy S6 and many other phones, the Note 5 here has optical image stabilization (OIS), which will help keep shaking hands from blurring shots, and an array of modes and tools. There's auto-HDR right on the screen (this helps keep photos looking true to life) and panorama and selective focus as separate modes within.. Brand-new is a live broadcasting feature that lets you record to YouTube. There's intentionally a 30-second delay between when you start recording and when the footage hits YouTube. This is essentially Samsung and YouTube's take on Twitter's Periscope tool. (The live broadcast feature is appearing first on the Note 5 and S6 Edge+, and is currently exclusive to those phones -- though how long that will last is anyone's guess.). What else is new? Tap to focus and an exposure control appears that lets you slide to brighten or darken the scene. Take a photo in Pro mode, and you'll have the option to save it as a raw file, one that the phone hasn't automatically processed, say into a JPEG format, first. This option gives photographers much more post-processing control. You can record a collage of four 6-second videos, to which you can add background music and share, share away (the file saves as a 720p MP4). If you're hungry for more modes (like the rear-cam selfie shot), it's easy to download more from the camera app.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Need a removeable battery … period. I was ready to buy until I saw that. Need a new phone … guess I’ll need to start looking for a different manufacturer.

Why does the USA version of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is no way the same as the Korean version??. I simply fall in love with Note 7 after watching the promotional video and features. Non-removeable battery again?? That’s why I didn’t upgrade from the Note 4 to the 5. I take my phone out in the hills with me for days at a time and completely rely on being able to swap out batteries. Nowadays instead of buying more batteries which is the obviously more expensive option, you should just buy a larger battery to carry around to recharge your device. also the galaxy phones dont even need to be plugged in anymore to charge it can just be in contact with it. and just a suggestion but i would use an app killer to keep extra apps from running in background(dramatically increase longevity of battery life).

Looks like your cart is empty. Get quick access to guides, parts, and answers for your devices. Comments: 48. Views: 140k. iFixit Opening Picks set of 6. Learn how to repair your Samsung Galaxy Note7 with this video overview.. Samsung's line of phones-that-don't-fit-in-your-pocket is back! And in a Microsoftian move, they're going from Note5 straight to Note7. On the surface, it looks like an S7 Edge with a bigger screen and a fancy stylus, but we know better: no guts, no glory. Update: We added some sweet X-ray imagery, from our friends at Creative Electron .. Do you enjoy the odd teardown? We’ve got three (way cooler than two) ways to stay up to date with the latest repair news: find us on Twitter , join our inner circle on Facebook , and check out our Instagram !. This teardown is not a repair guide. To repair your Samsung Galaxy Note7, use our service manual .. It's a mix of new and familiar as we peruse the Note7's specs:. Curved panel 5.7" Super AMOLED display with 2560 × 1440 resolution (518 ppi) and Gorilla Glass 5. Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor with 4 GB RAM + Adreno 530 GPU. 12-megapixel, ƒ/1.7 rear camera with OIS, dual pixel autofocus, 4K video; 5-megapixel/1080p selfie camera. 64 GB internal storage, with an additional 256 GB available via MicroSD expansion. S Pen stylus, USB-C, and headphone jack (phew). IP68 dust and water resistance rating. As we boldly go where no tinkerer has gone before, we come across some star ports hiding out near the bottom edge. From left to right we observe:. That last one's not a port at all, it's the illustrious S Pen. Removing the S Pen is as smooth as slicing warm butter.. Building off the Note5's mid-production design modification , the S Pen doesn't fit into its slot backwards. Our teardown hands are itching to get down to business, but we take a moment to test out the S Pen.. First impressions: this stylus stacks up pretty well against Microsoft's Surface Pen and Apple's Pencil .. The S Pen is smaller (and more stow-able) than either, but still has a scan rate of 360 Hz and senses 4,096 levels of pressure compared to the Pencil's 240 Hz and the Surface Pen's 1,024 levels of sensitivity.. In an additional level of customization, the S Pen comes with two interchangeable tips: a soft tip for writing on smooth glass, and a hard tip for use with screen protectors.. If opening stubbornly adhered Samsung devices was an Olympic sport, our teardown room would be filled with gold medals .. We take a minute to stretch while the iOpener works its magic, softening the adhesive under the rear glass.. We fly off the starting blocks, iSclack and opening pick in hand. Pop ! The rear glass dislodges from the chassis. Whoosh ! The rest of the adhesive didn't stand a chance. This is something of a delicate procedure, and we still miss the days of plastic peel off rear cases.. Seeing these good ol' familiar screws draws our focus down to what they're securing: a sweet wireless charging coil.. Samsung states that "once you've had wireless charging, there's no going back. " It's like having the event horizon of a black hole right in your phone, with all the convenience that entails.. We suspect the NFC antenna is also bundled into this wafer-thin assembly. NFC is no stranger to Galaxy Phones .. With that, we get our first full reveal of the Note7. We come across an unusual battery cable design. At first glance, this is most definitely a slide. We're getting a little motion sick just looking at all of those winding curves.. Fortunately for us, a flick of a spudger is all it takes to pry the (off-kilter) battery connector cable off the motherboard.. With battery disconnected we delve deeper.. First victim: the single speaker, with built in antenna.. Of note, the speaker pass-through has a gasket and mesh liner, in addition to the grille punched into the case (likely a waterproofing measure).. Fix Kits starting at $16.99. We could almost hear the battery laugh in our faces when we tried to pluck it out bare-handed—but our inner Hulk emerges as we muscle with all the might our spudger can muster.. This 3500 mAh, 13.48 Wh battery is significantly more powerful than the 10.45 Wh one found in the similarly sized iPhone 6s Plus , but it falls just a bit short of its smaller sibling, the Galaxy S7 Edge , which comes in at 13.86 Wh.. Curiously, the Note7's battery is fortified by walls carved from the rear case, providing extra structural integrity, and maybe even some water protection.. Dongguan ITM Electronics Company LTD, interesting that this name never appears in all the news stories about the exploding batteries.. That's because Samsung designs their new phones not to have replaceable batteries. It's starting to seem like a guaranteed way to make (most) people buy new devices every couple of years or so.. Out comes the motherboard, with three little cameras in tow.. Front and rear cameras are familiar fare on smartphones, so what's the third camera for?. That would be the Note7's trick iris scanner. It's actually a two-part system: a nearby infrared blaster invisibly lights up your eye, while the sensor captures an image that's said to be more secure than a fingerprint.. For comparison we have the iris scanner (right) with the Note7's 5-megapixel, ƒ/1.7 selfie cam (left).. And for the X-ray comparison, here we have the two cameras still in the device.. With the motherboard deftly extracted, we take our tweezers to the hefty main camera and line him up for closer look.. It's déjà vu all over again as we pull out what appears to be the same Sony IMX260 -based main camera that we uncovered in the S7 and S7 Edge.. And the similarities go further, all the way down to:. the Winbond Q32FWXGIG serial flash memory. and OIS-enabling gyroscope, likely the next generation of the one found in the S7 Edge. what is the GPS chip this device is using. We're down to the meat and potatoes of this teardown, and it seems like Samsung unified more than their product numbering—this chipset is nearly identical to that found in the S7 and S7 Edge .. Samsung K3RG2G20CMMGCJ 4 GB LPDDR4 SDRAM layered over a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820. Samsung KLUCG4J1CB-B0B1 64 GB Universal Flash Storage 2.0. Avago AFEM-9040 multiband multimode module. Qorvo QM78064 high band RF fusion module, TQF6260 front-end module and QM63001A diversity receive module. Qualcomm WCD9335 audio codec and DSP DBMD4 audio/voice processor. Murata FAJ15 front-end module. More note -worthy chips hide on the backside:. Samsung 3420S7 G707A3 Wi-Fi module (most likely contains a Broadcom Wi-Fi SoC). Qualcomm QFE3100 envelope tracker. Qualcomm WTR4905 and WTR3925 RF transceivers. IDT P9221S wireless power receiver (likely an iteration of IDT P9220 ) + MPB02 603PD9 1625ELn + MAX77838 power IC. Heading south, we hit the modular headphone jack—ready to let the music flow while keeping water out, with a nice sealing gasket.. This phablet ships with an IP68 water resistant rating, meaning it is dust tight, and can survive under 1 meter (or more) of water.. The USB-C port is new to the Note line—and while reversibility is handy, change is hard. Samsung kindly includes a micro-USB-to-C adapter to keep your cables relevant.. Out goes the daughterboard array ! Unlike the one found in the S7 , this board used rigid PCB interconnects. This keeps the spidery cable from being flimsy. If you like tiny heat pipes, Note7 has you covered. This looks like the same "liquid cooling" copper heat dispersal apparatus we pulled from the vanilla S7 and S7 Edge .. Nearby, a note -able amount of glue secures this plastic cover over the S Pen chamber. It's probably there to help ingress-proof the stylus' slot.. We're not normally fans of glue—but this waterproofing effort doesn't seem to hinder repair much.. Inside, a simple clip grabs the S Pen notches, and a gray rubber bumper protects the nib.. The volume buttons look pretty complicated, but that doesn't slow us down. Braced with years of experience plucking our unibrows, we dive in, a pair of tweezers in hand.. First out are the microswitches, followed by a reinforcement bracket full of rubber gaskets. Not quite the same, but similar to another waterproofing approach we've seen.. But...what's this? The button covers are oddly trapped within the outer case. Could this mean the case is double-walled? Is this a waterproofing feature? Perhaps a structural feature? Your guess is as good as ours.. We're down to slim pickings, and the last component to surrender is this front-facing sensor array containing:. IR blaster to enable iris scanning. We saw the iris scanning sensor earlier—this component provides the infrared illumination to really make your eyes pop.. And here's the moment you've been waiting for—the exploded (edit: no pun intended) diagram of the Note7.. Many components are modular and can be replaced independently. Improved cable routing means the charging port board can be removed without disassembling the display. The battery can be removed without first ousting the motherboard, but tough adhesive and a glued-on rear panel make replacement very difficult. Front and back glass make for double the crackability, and strong adhesive on the rear glass makes it very difficult to gain entry into the device. Because of the curved screen, replacing the front glass without destroying the display is probably impossible.. Repairability 4 out of 10. would you think its worth upgrading from the s7edge to the Note 7?. I would get the iPhone 7 :). Yeah I would, that stylus is so %#*@ sexy.. For sure, note 7 is a beast of a phone, you wont regret it. Is it possible to keep the water resistance after opening the phone for something simple like battery replacement. I will take my chances with this device to replace my note 4. I just did that and I dont like it.... The screen is not as wide because of the curve. Can you verify whether the phone will support 4x4 MIMO for LTE?. Some versions ll support 4*4 MIMO with qualcomm 820 chipset.. I see no home button :/. MacArthur Lingenfelter -. First picture in step 2 has it. The ones that support 4x4 mimo are the qualcomm 820 ones not the exynos powered note 7s. 4/10 repairability for the Note 7, and 7/10 repairability for the 6S? Come on Samsung, give that corruption money to iFixit so they can give you good scores arbitrarily.... do you even see an open iphone ? or you are just a troll that wants to say anything...I changed my iPhone screen without any knowledge about phone repairing.... dude iphone 6s doesn't have adhesive to open the phone, so yeah they have higher score in that.. beside see iphone7 which has a lot of adhesive for protect from water and dust. I wouldn't call going from Note 5 to Note 7 the same as what Microsoft had to do. Do you realize how many websites and web based software apps rely on OS detection? It would make all the systems looking for windows9x break, badly. Samsung just want their version to start matching to help prevent confusion with the consumers.. Is it possible to see what brand the fingerprint sensor is?. Can this phone make a call from Ireland to Northern California? What about from Portland, OR to Portland, ME??. Yes and yes, if you have international calling.. Anyone k now if taking off the back cover messes up the waterproofing in any way? On my Note 5 I took the back cover off (very easy) and was able to repaint it a nice black with no logos and also put in small pieces of tin paper so it stuck on my magnetic car holder. But I'm hesitant to remove the Note 7 back. The process looks as easy as the Note 5, but I'm afraid of ruining the waterproof design.. Is it possible to tear down the iris scanner? How many lenses does the iris scanner have?. The Power Management is MAX77838 not MAX77830. I think you're right, good catch! Thank you!. Unfortunately they've all been recalled because of exploding batteries...... Well the note 7 battery explodes. It reads "Li-ion battery" on the battery label, so is it actually Li-ion cell using liquid EL or Li-polymer cell?. Because ifixit is a website of USA.... how about a tear down for the replacement unit?. I would get the note 7. So I wanna buy a Galaxy Note 8. Did anybody try using external lipo battery with this device (or even a few 18650 cells in 4p1s configuration) :-)?. (instead of internal combutible one), or just slot in 1.5 AH 20C cell from the RC lipo pack instead of 3.5AH combustible one?. If coupled with good BMS circuit it would make this device safe instantly :-).. Perhaps you can add a battery from a different Samsung phone. Or only fast-charge from the wall and place the charger on a timer, 15m on and 15m off to prevent battery heating.. And something Samsung can do with the people that refuse to turn over their phone is to ask them politely if they want battery logging data stored on the phone to help find the cause of the problem, turn it into a research project (using a new app I guess). This would prevent their next phone doing the same thing. The app could send a SOS (known from the phone’s rising temperature) and the collected data as the phone is combusting if it is WIFI/4G connected at the time. If the problem is found, the recall could be halted if it can be solved with a software patch (even if it is a battery problem – although liion tech is susceptable to insulation peircing from crystal growths in the battery and that is not avoidable).. when's the date of this teardown article?. It's so challenging to translate these articles, so only English and French versions of iFixit are available, and there's much less contents in French version..

You now have access to benefits that can help you choose right, be safe and stay informed.. Samsung Galaxy Note7: Water-Resistant and Future-Proof. The new phablet claims a tougher body, an iris scanner, a smarter stylus, and a nearly immortal battery. Yes, send me a copy of this email.. We respect your privacy .. All email addresses you provide will be used just for sending this story.. Samsung’s latest phablet, the Galaxy Note7, is an advanced smartphone that borrows heavily from a model that’s already been on the market for almost 6 months. That’s okay because that phone is its sibling, the top-rated Galaxy S7, which is brimming with advanced, high-quality features worth stealing. In fact, that’s why Samsung named this phone the Note7 and not the Note6, which would have the logical name for the successor to the Note5.. Note7 features ported over from the S7 include the top-notch 12.2-megapixel camera and its compliance with IP68 manufacturing standard, which means in this case that the Note7 should be able to handle immersion in about 5 feet of water for up to 30 minutes. But the Note7 edges out the S7 with mammoth-sized 5.7-inch display that’s better for multitasking, especially when used in conjunction with the phone’s S-Pen stylus (which now lets you scribble notes on the phone’s screen while under water). The Note7 also adds an iris scanner for unlocking the phone screen with a glance, and a special desktop folder that protects your personal or sensitive info from prying third-party apps or unauthorized eyeballs.. The N7 may be tougher, too, because it’s one of the first smartphones to protect its screen with Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5 , which Corning says can help smartphone screens survive a “1.6-meter, shoulder-height drops onto hard, rough surfaces up to 80 percent of the time.”. As you may recall, the Galaxy S7 Active, a hard-bodied version of the S7 sold exclusively by AT&T, flunked our water-resistance tests. Samsung pegged the problem to a flaw in the manufacturing process, which it said was quickly fixed. In any case, we’re prepping our pressurized water tank right now to check the phone's water-resistance claims.. Preorders for the Note7, which will be available in black, silver, and blue, begin August 3. In the meantime, here’s a short preview of this talented new phablet, which Samsung showed us last week at its headquarters across from New York City’s High Line elevated park.. The Note7, which measures 6 inches tall x 2.9 inches wide, is only 0.29 inches thick, easily making it one of the thinnest smartphones on the market—not just among phablets. As with last year’s giant Galaxy S6 Edge +, the left and right edges of the display curve away from the viewer.. The curved edges are more subtle than on earlier models, and don’t have any special function. But they do help give the Note7 a distinctly refined look. The back of the phone is curved too, away from the palm, which helps this large phone feel comfortable in the hand.. Unlock it with a blink of an eye. Taking a cue from Microsoft’s Lumia 950 , the Note7 has a novel, nifty iris scanner that will allow users to unlock the phone screen by merely gazing at it. It works like this: When you hold up the front of the phone about two feet from your face, an LED on the top left side of the phone shines an infrared beam at both your eyes, while a special camera on the upper right side of the phone captures the unique patterns in your. Samsung says the iris scanner may eventually be used for authorizing app and web purchases, but said that the technology is not quite there yet. Though it worked fine for my colleague in Samsung’s well-lit offices, Samsung said that the technology has some weak spots. For instance, it may not work if you’re wearing glasses or contacts, or even in dark environments that would cause your pupils to dilate.. The Note7's S-Pen, which also works under water, has several new skills that can be activated via the phone's Action Menu.. Samsung made its S-Pen stylus more sensitive and reduced its point to that of a 0.7mm ballpoint pen for sharper penmanship when scribbling notes and more precision when editing photos and other graphic elements. You can do more with it, too. For instance, the Note7’s interface has a new Air Command mode that magnifies whatever part of the screen you hover the pen over. It worked fine in our demo, producing a little magnified square on the screen. This feature, thankfully, is not on by default. You have to activate it using the Air Command Menu that kicks on whenever you pull the S-Pen out of its hole in the bottom of the phone. When you switch to another task, the magnification mode switches off.. The S-Pen can also translate words into another language when you hover it over the word in the document or web page you’re reading. You have to pick the language in the settings, and it can only translate one language at a time.. As we said, the display on the Note7 is the same size and has the resolution as the one on last year’s Note5. That’s excellent because the Note5 display boasts a resolution of 1440 x 2560 (about 500 pixels per inch, or ppi), far more detail than the naked human eye can see. The Note7 display takes things a bit further by being able to present the wider range of bright and dark elements of videos encoded with. Check the top smartphone cameras in our reviews and the smartphones with the best battery life. And see our reviews of phone plans and carriers .. With the Note7’s Smart Select tool, you’ll be able to use the S-Pen to grab any photos or segment of a video—stored locally on the phone or found on the web—and turn it into a 15-second GIF you can share via social networks or email. On-board editing tools will let you further embellish your creation with text and other treatments.. The Secure Folder on the Note7 will encrypt anything you put in it, such as personal files or the data stored by apps in Secure Folder—including shopping and banking data or your contacts—to prevent third-party apps from accessing them. Using Secure Folder shouldn’t impede the operation of those apps or their communication with core phone apps, according to Samsung. For instance, with your contacts encrypted, the on-screen caller ID should work when you get a call, and you should still be able to share a photo via text message.. Like the recent Samsung models that preceded it, the Note7 comes with a multitude of charging options, supporting both Qi and Powermat wireless charging pads out of the box—as well as quick charging via its own USB Type C charger. But Samsung says you shouldn’t need these options very often, thanks to its capacious 3,500mAh battery that should keep the phone humming for more than 40 hours of “mixed” use. (The Note5 has a not-too-shabby 3,000mAh battery that in our tests provided more than 24 hours of talk time.) Samsung also beefed up the number of settings that can be activated automatically or on the fly to stretch battery life even further.. The new phone uses a USB Type-C cable that, like the Lightning connector on an iPhone, can be inserted into the phone no matter which way you hold it; there is no "wrong-side up." Other advantages include a potentially larger data transfer rate—up to 10 gigabits per second­—and support for bi-directional power. That means your phone will receive a charge while it’s transmitting files to a compatible TV, printer, or other accessory over the same cable.. Samsung says the Note7 has the same 12.2-megapixel camera that’s in the Galaxy S7. That’s good news for the Note7 because the Galaxy S7 has one of the best cameras we’ve ever seen on a phone; it produces very good 1080p videos and ultra-sharp, color-accurate still images. The on-board optical image stabilizer should also improve one’s chances of taking better handheld photos under low-light conditions.. Samsung already has one of the most intuitive interfaces in the smartphone marketplace, smartly laying out critical phone settings in an easy-to-read format. And when you don’t immediately see what you're looking for, the phone’s search engine is quite good at hunting down lesser-known features and controls. For the Note7, Samsung made things a tad easier by consolidating the list of roughly 30 settings adjustments to about 16, nestling similar features under one umbrella. You’ll also have deeper access to app features from the pull-down notifications bar. For instance, in addition to launching the flashlight, you’ll also be able to adjust the intensity of its beam.. We’ll have more on the Note7 once we can submit the phone to our in-depth lab tests.. Correction: This story originally stated that apps placed in Secure Folder would be encrypted. It has been updated to clarify that only the data stored by the apps will be encrypted. We also indicated that Samsung currently has plans to port Secure Folder to the Galaxy S7.

Why the Samsung Galaxy Note7 Is the Phone You've Been Waiting For. Samsung's Galaxy Note product family is solely responsible for making big phones a thing in our daily lives, and the latest iteration is better than ever. Read on for five features that make the Samsung Galaxy Note7 the best phablet out there.. Update: Samsung permanently discontinued the Galaxy Note7 due to safety concerns related to the battery of the smartphone. Therefore, we can no longer recommend this device.. If you are still an owner of such device, please power it down and contact the retailer you bought it from to replace it with another smartphone. If you are currently shopping for an Android phone, consider one of the many alternatives in the top-tier segment.. A close relative to the Samsung Galaxy S7 duo , the freshly released Samsung Galaxy Note7 is, handily, the best big phone money can buy. In order to set itself apart from its competitors, the newcomer features a number of cool hardware bits, headed by an iris scanner and a waterproof body. Of course, the product family's signature S Pen is also on board — and better than ever.. Below are five key reasons that the Galaxy Note7 is the big phone to buy. To find out more about the device, head over to our in-depth review .. You Can Unlock It With Your Eyes. Forget about the fingerprint sensor! With a built-in iris scanner, the Samsung Galaxy Note7 allows you to unlock it with just a simple glance. The nifty tech feature uses its own camera sensor that's located on the other side of the selfie camera, and works in all lighting conditions.. In addition to unlocking the phone, the iris scanner can also help users verify their Samsung account, as well as sign into web pages. The last feature is available via Samsung's own web browser, not Google Chrome.. Bestproducts.com participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.. Its S Pen Stylus Has All the GIFs and Allows for Precise Control. Co-developed by Samsung and Wacom, the S Pen stylus of the Galaxy Note7 is among the main reasons why the phone is a productivity powerhouse. The latest iteration of the accessory gives users the ability to easily create and share animated GIF files, so it is more fun than any of its predecessors. With the ability to detect more than 4,000 levels of pressure, the S Pen is also a perfect tool for sketch artists.. It's Waterproof — and Even Works Under Water. Samsung's Galaxy S7 family proved that smartphones can be both good-looking and waterproof, and the Note7 continues the trend. The newcomer has an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance, just like its more compact Galaxy S7 siblings. This means that it can spend up to 30 minutes in up to 5 feet of water without any consequences.. The device's S Pen stylus is waterproof too, allowing overly productive users to use it in unusual places such as in a bathtub, under the shower, or at the swimming pool. If circumstances require, you can even doodle notes under water!. It's Way Tougher Than It Looks. The Samsung Galaxy Note7 features front and back panels made from Corning Gorilla Glass 5, so it is a whole lot tougher than it sleek body suggests. The recently released fifth Gorilla Glass iteration enables the phone to survive 5-foot drops on hard surfaces. Scratches from the keys in your bag shouldn't be a problem, either.. Most importantly, the tougher build of the Galaxy Note7 hasn't come at the expense of its design or weight. The device is actually a lot more compact than its large 5.7-inch display suggests.. Samsung put one of the best mobile cameras in the business in the Galaxy S7 duo, and we're happy to see it featured in the Note7 as well. The snapper can capture stunning photos in just about any lighting condition, as well as lock focus faster than any of its competitors. A handy launch shortcut, on the other hand, ensures that mobile shutterbugs never miss a perfect shot.. Top-Rated Samsung Electronics You Need in 2018. Our Review of Samsung Galaxy Note8.

Samsung Galaxy Note7 Review: A great (very expensive) phone. 2016/08/24 1:57pm PST Aug 24, 2016. Galaxy Note7 Phone Reviews Reviews Samsung. 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design 5 Display 6 Camera 7 Performance and battery 8 Software and S Pen 9 Conclusion. We are updating our review of the Galaxy Note7 to issue a. do not buy warning for this device. Because of a growing number of fires in the "fixed" version of the Galaxy Note7, we can no longer in any way recommend purchasing one. Not only is the Note7 potentially dangerous, it is in danger of seeing reduced support, resale value, and major flight restrictions as a result of the fallout from this incident.. Do not buy the Galaxy Note7.. For more information, see our full post here .. A few years ago, Samsung was not known for making phones that looked nice. popular phones, but no one swooned over them. That started to change after the sour reception Samsung got with the Galaxy S5. taking risks with materials and designs, and it made some bad phones in the process. However, here we are with the Galaxy Note7, a device that. the culmination of Samsung's design refinements over the years. Samsung is clearly proud of what it has on offer with this phone, but you'll pay handsomely to get your hands on it. Can a phone be good enough to justify an $850 price tag in 2016? Let's find out.. 12MP front with OIS and f/1.7, 5MP front. 3500mAh with quick charge 2.0, USB Type-C, wireless fast charging. 153.5 x 73.9 x 7.9 mm, 169g. The Note7 has the best build quality of any Android phone I've used. It's surprisingly small for a 5.7-inch display, and it's water resistant too. the best photography experience you can get. This phone nails snapshots more consistently and in more lighting conditions than other phones. Its low-light performance is especially impressive. No one can touch Samsung's display technology. This screen looks amazing both indoors and out. The smaller curve isn't as striking as Samsung's other curved phones, but it makes sense for the stylus. If you need (or just want) a stylus, this is the only game in town. The stylus can't be jammed in backward this year, and it has a few new features. Okay, I thought this would be dumb, but it's actually pretty cool. It works better than I expected. The Note7 has above average longevity. The tweaked TouchWiz UI looks nice overall after a few adjustments. Features like Secure Folder and the extensive power options are appreciated.. slow phone, it's slower than other Snapdragon 820 devices. Samsung hasn't kept up with other phones when it comes to the fingerprint sensor. It's not as fast or as accurate as I'd expect from an $850 phone. And about that price, the $850 launch price is substantially more than the Note5 was, and more than $200 higher than the Galaxy S7. It's hard to justify that much money for a phone when cheaper devices have gotten very good. This is still TouchWiz, if that's something you can't handle. It has a few unnecessary features like the device management interface from Cheetah Mobile.. Before I held the Note7 in my hand, I knew that it had a 5.7-inch curved screen. This was information I had typed out and posted on the internet at several points. But holding the phone in my hand, that didn't seem right. I wondered, was I wrong? Had I been presenting inaccurate information? I checked the specs just to make sure, and yes, it's a 5.7-inch screen. When you hold this phone in your hand, it feels much smaller than that.. This is the first impression made by the Note7, one of almost impossible compactness and elegance. It's narrower than the Note 5 was and just barely wider than the Galaxy S7 Edge with its smaller 5.5-inch display. The front and back panels are Gorilla Glass 5, and they curve toward the central aluminum band symmetrically. That makes the phone more comfortable to hold than the other curved display smartphones Samsung has released. The Note7 is also water resistant, which the Note5 was not. a nice bonus when your $850 phone can't be destroyed by a little water. Yes, it's still a slippery fingerprint magnet, but I guess everyone has decided that doesn't matter. Below the display, you've got Samsung's trademark physical home button and capacitive back/overview keys. The capacitive buttons are still on the wrong sides (Samsung, why?), but the home button is a little different. It's flatter than on other Samsung devices, and almost completely flush with the surface of the phone. The ridge around the perimeter gives it good tactility, though.. The fingerprint sensor is built into the home button as it has been on all Samsung's phones going back to the GS5. Not much has changed since the GS6, and I think that's a problem for Samsung. The fingerprint sensor gets the job done, but it's not as fast or as accurate as what you get on phones like the Nexus 6P, HTC 10, or even the OnePlus 3. And by the way, that last phone costs. less than half as much as the Note7. The Note7 is too sensitive about the angle you hold your finger at, and reading your print takes about a second. That doesn't sound like a lot, but it's just enough that I often start wondering if it's even detected my finger. Samsung really needs to up its game here.. On the rear panel, the Note7 has a lot in common with the Galaxy S7. The camera module is flush with the back, and the entire device is slightly thicker than last year's version. This allows for a larger battery, which I'll get to later. There's also a heart rate monitor in the flash module. I sometimes (okay, pretty much always) forget it's there. I'm not even sure why Samsung still includes these.. On the bottom is the new USB Type-C port, a speaker, and the S Pen. The USB port is a USB port—you've seen Type-C ports before, but it's nice that Samsung is getting with the program. You get an A-C cable with the phone, as well as a few adapters for old cables. A lot of sound comes out of that little grille, but you won't hear much bass. It's a fine speaker for voice, but not so much for music.. One hardware feature unique to the Note7 is Samsung's new iris scanning tech. This has been rumored for years , and it's finally a reality. In all honesty, it works better than I would have expected. The phone uses an IR pulse to illuminate your face for the front-facing camera to get a good look at your eyes. This will work even in the dark, and with glasses on (though maybe not as well).. Iris scanning can be used to unlock the phone and access Samsung's special Knox-infused features like Secure Folder. The iris scanning UI will appear at the top of the screen whenever it's active. You get two large circles, which you want to get your eyes in. The phone needs to be roughly 18-inches or closer to your face, with the optimal distance in my estimation being about a foot. The scanner is fairly flexible about the angle; the phone just has to be in front of your face. If you're in that zone and your eyes are open, iris scanning is extremely fast—so fast that the iris scanning UI doesn't even show up. It takes a little practice to get it in the right area and angle consistently, though.. Iris scanning is a bit of a luxury, but it's neat. It's a feature to show off to your friends, if nothing else.. You hear this every year with Samsung's phone, but the Note7 has the best display available on a smartphone.. The resolution is still 1440p, but Samsung has kicked the brightness up from the Note5 and even from the GS7. The Note7 is the most readable phone in bright outdoor light without a doubt. You can also pull the brightness way down for use in a dark room. The default calibration bumps the colors up to look slightly richer than real life, but there are several different screen modes.. Lesser displays on the HTC 10 or OnePlus 3 might look fine; even "very good" in a lot of situations. The Note7's screen is simply nicer in every respect compared to those.. Samsung has brought the curved AMOLED design to the Note series this year, and there won't be a flat version. With the Note's reliance on the stylus, Samsung was faced with a problem. The stylus doesn't work well on the curved edges, so the Note7 has a bit less of a curve than the GS7 Edge does. This results in more flat writing space on the display. It's a little less striking than the GS7's display because of it, but the overall shape of the device is nicer and it makes more sense for a stylus.. Since there's essentially no bezel around the display, touch rejection is key to making the Note7 usable. It was always a little buggy on the Galaxy S7 Edge, and it's pretty much the same on the Note7. It doesn't ruin the experience, but I find that I end up triggering the wrong thing on occasion because the phone thinks I'm tapping the curved section while holding it.. The viewing angles are perfect with no color casting or loss of brightness at off-angles. The gentler curve does come with one important advantage—there's less UI distortion at the edge of the screen.. The camera module in the Note7 is the same one we saw in the Galaxy S7. It's 12MP with optical stabilization and larger pixels for better low-light performance. It does about as well as the Galaxy S7 in my experience, which is to say excellent. The speed with which the Note7 focuses is uncanny. It's faster to acquire the subject and snap a photo than any other phone (ignoring the equally good GS7). as it takes virtually no extra time to snap a photo compared to non-HDR. I love the way Google's HDR+ photos look, but they take so long to capture as to be almost useless for moving subjects. Samsung's HDR mode is almost as good and it's considerably more robust.. The Note7 nails most exposures in bright light, even when you've got a very bright background with a shadowy foreground. Indoors, it's still the best performing smartphone camera. There's very little noise and color reproduction is excellent. The white balance and clarity are noticeably better than what you get from other phones. There's also no shutter lag in such conditions, which is impressive. A lot of phone cameras get very slow in poor lighting.. The Note7 is better not just because of the hardware, but because Samsung's image processing is superior. Look at the Nexus 6P, which has a solid camera with very similar hardware. It consistently produces photos that are warmer and more noisy in low light. It's hard to find fault with the Note7's camera, but I would say the Note7 shows a slight tendency to overexpose indoor photos, leaving the resulting image a little washed out. This is more noticeable in poor lighting. However, I think it usually results in more usable photos in those conditions than the "natural" brightness.. The Note7 is powered by a Snapdragon 820, just like every other flagship device of note in 2016. So that means it's blazing fast, right? Well, not entirely. slow phone, but it doesn't feel quite as snappy as the LG G5 or HTC 10, for example. I don't see any issues with memory management on this phone, though.. It's tempting to blame it on the TouchWiz bloat, but I think this level of performance is by design. Samsung has decided how fast a phone ought to be to keep people happy, and considers everything beyond that to be wasted energy. The Note7 feels as fast as the Note5 in general use. Nothing lags (except the stock keyboard, which I do not like at all), but you might wait a split second longer for an app to open or a web page to refresh. This isn't the sort of thing you'll always notice, but you can tell if you've got another phone side-by-side to compare.. Bottom line: the Note7 is fast. enough , but it's not going to blow you away.. The performance tuning allows for the battery life to be very, very good, though. The 3500mAh battery is non-removable, of course, but it'll last you easily more than a day under moderate use.. Battery life estimation is always difficult because your usage patterns might not be like mine. That said, I left the phone with stock settings, installed all my usual apps, and had three email accounts syncing. With light use, I think I could make it through almost two days with the Note7. With heavy use (including email, messaging, gaming, a few phone calls, and some music streaming), the Note 7 manages more than 6 hours of screen time over the course of 16 hours of total usage.. Samsung has also beefed up its battery saving options this year. The medium and maximum power saving modes include expected things like deactivated background data, lowered brightness, and throttled CPU clocks. In addition, they change the resolution the interface is rendered at. Medium uses 1080p and maximum uses 720p. What's more, all the settings are configurable. If you want to set up medium power saving to slow the CPU, render at 720p, and leave background data untouched, you can do that.. Much was made of Samsung's so-called "Grace" UI in the weeks leading up to the Note7 announcement. It was supposed to be a lighter-weight version of TouchWiz, but I estimate that was the 35th time we've heard such a. Instead, it's a modest overall improvement with the usual smattering of bad decisions. Par for the course with Samsung, really.. The home screen hasn't changed much. The Briefing panel is still there, and you still need to turn it off because it's terrible. The app drawer defaults to a weird custom order, and you have to keep reorganizing it alphabetically because it doesn't stay that way (inexplicably). The phone also defaults to putting dumb squircle frames around all your app icons. Luckily, you can turn that off.. Notifications are essentially stock, but Samsung has revamped the quick settings substantially. Every single tile in the quick settings has a drop down menu, even those that have no reason to have one. It makes sense with things like Bluetooth (list of devices), power saving (different efficiency levels), and WiFi (list of networks), but NFC, airplane mode, location, and others have them too. in the drop down are redundant toggles and descriptions of what the features do. The quick settings also has a search bar for the Finder, but this is just a glorified shortcut. It opens the Finder app, and doesn't even highlight the search bar—you have to tap again.. The Always-on Display got a nice upgrade this time. When the Galaxy S7 launched, the only notification icons you'd get when the phone was asleep were those from built-in apps. That made it pretty useless for keeping tabs on your notifications. Now, you can see icons from any app, and you can double tap on them to launch. You don't get the notification text, but this is still a step in the right direction.. Features like scrolling screenshot, one-handed mode, and multi-window are still present as well. There's no substantial difference in the way these function. Because this device has a curved screen, modest though it is, the Note7 gets Samsung's Edge UX. It's the same as the GS7 Edge—you can drag the handle in from the edge to get quick access to apps, the calendar, weather, news, and more. I also really like Secure Folder, which is adapted from an optional feature on Samsung's last few phones. It lets you segregate certain apps and their data from the rest of the system, and it's quick to access with the iris scanner.. The settings UI has been made much more vertical as well. Rather than have multiple sections of very specific menu items in the top-level settings, the Note7 collapses everything into fewer items. For example, instead of having WiFi, Bluetooth, data monitor, and so on at the top, there's just a single item for "Connections" that contains all of them. I've never seen a phone simplify the settings like this, but it's actually rather nice once you get used to it. There's less scrolling to get where you need to go.. The settings are also home to something you probably won't care for—a device management UI powered by Cheetah Mobile. Samsung had the so-called Smart Manager (also powered by CM) in many of its phones last year and this year (except where removed by carriers), but this takes it a step further. The features of Smart Manager have basically. become the device management screen. If you want to see your battery, storage, or RAM settings, you have to go through Cheetah Mobile.. So, what do you get when you open Device Maintenance? A giant graph that tells you how "optimized" your phone is (on a scale of 0-100) based on pointless metrics like cached data, running apps, and so on. You know, typical Cheetah Mobile garbage. There's a big "Optimize Now" button that kills all that, which is not something you need to ever do. There's also a dedicated task killer in the RAM menu.. was a foolish decision on Samsung's part. The device management features are the only part of the software that I'd call truly bad.. The S Pen design seems largely unchanged from the Note5 with one major difference—you can't put it in the phone backward. It was possible to put the Note5's S Pen in the wrong way and get it stuck and/or break the pen detection mechanism. A slight tweak to the shape of the S Pen this year makes that impossible.. If you've used an S Pen stylus before, the basic functionality is unchanged. You can hover over the screen to see a cursor and perform a few gestures like scrolling and magnifying images. The button on the side of the S Pen can be used to bring up Air Control from any screen or highlight text. The screen-off note taking functionality that debuted with the Note 5 is still front and center—just pop the stylus out to jot something down. The screen selection tool also gains the ability to record a GIF of an area of the display. It's a neat trick, but I'm not sure when I'll ever use it.. It seems like Samsung is having trouble coming up with new uses for the stylus. The main benefit is simply that it provides higher precision when using the device, but so much of Android is designed to be touched with your fingers rather than a stylus. The S Pen seems like a nice bonus these days more than an indispensable feature.. The Galaxy Note7 is an amazing piece of hardware. The little ergonomic tweaks Samsung has made to the formula over the years have really paid off. The company took risks as it readjusted following the Galaxy S5. There were phones like the Galaxy Round and Galaxy Note Edge that didn't catch on, but those were just experiments, and the Note7 is the pay off.. There is no other phone on the market that's built as well as this. The HTC 10 is a solid phone, the OnePlus 3 is a solid phone, and the same goes for many other devices you can buy right now. Not only is the Note7 shockingly comfortable to hold for a 5.7-inch display, it's water resistant without. No port covers and no rubber gaskets—it's just a beautiful device.. The Galaxy Note7 is not the fastest phone, in fact it's a little slower than most other Snapdragon 820 devices. It's fast enough, though, and the battery life is phenomenal. Admittedly, this might not be the right balance for everyone.. The display is the best one Samsung has ever made, and that makes it the best anyone has ever made. No other display manufacturer can touch what Samsung is doing, and the curved design is just Samsung reminding us of that. It's a blatant flourish with little to no utility, but it is really, really pretty. The less extreme curve makes the S Pen more usable on this device, and it's definitely the most useful it's ever been... I don't see much need for the S Pen personally. The note taking and screen-capture features (yay, GIFs) are very slick and well-implemented, but I don't find myself using them too often.. I think Samsung's software on the Note7 is a net improvement, but only barely. I like the changes to the Always-on Display, and the aforementioned S Pen GIFs are neat. While there are some annoyances like the home screen icons, Briefing panel, and sluggish stock keyboard, you can easily replace or disable them. The Device Maintenance features are irredeemably dumb, though. I could go on complaining about all the little things TouchWiz got wrong, but the fact of the matter is it's worlds better than less mature manufacturer skins like EMUI and MIUI. The Note7 gets almost everything right, but the cost remains a stumbling block. The $850 price tag is $150 more than the Note5 at launch. Even the 64GB Note5 variant (where available) was $100 less than the 64GB Note7. It's also priced more than $200 higher than the regular Galaxy S7 and more than $100 higher than the Galaxy S7 Edge. For the added money you get a larger screen, slightly better ergonomics, the S Pen, and the iris scanner. If money is no object and you really want one or more of those things, you should get the Note7. It's the best large phone you can get, but it's too expensive for most people..

I like to include the free stuff as lowering the effective price.. yeah with locked bootloader, no thanks. I'd keep my note 5 and buying a new nexus. Yes the next nexus seems a God choice .... Who makes it? I've never heard of this company before.. Please don't buy this S***, Boycott Samsung.. The phone is barely water resistant. Samsung really shouldn't oversell the IP68 rating. If you look at the tear down the phone relies on a lot of well wishes to keep water out. They should go the path of the OG Moto G have the water resistance but not push it with stupid lil Wayne videos or the underwater unboxing. And yes im one that thinks consumer Electronics and water dont mix anyway but they shouldn't set peoples expectations so high.. great phone!, however im waiting for Sailfish...its gonna be a beast...when it comes out....... When you say you kept it at stock settings but installed your usual apps, does that include a custom launcher?. Installed but not set as the default for the purposes of that test.. I'm mostly happy with the phone but is it just me or are the screens sorta washed out?. I'm gonna just leave this here since it's going to inevitably get posted anyways.. "With the Note 7, Samsung Still Delivers Embarrassing Real-World Performance". I addressed the performance in the post. It's not as fast as other SD820 phones, but it's okay.. I don't think that "Samsung has decided how fast a phone ought to be to keep people happy, and considers everything beyond that to be wasted energy" is a valid excuse for an $850 phone. Anything less than this thing being a top performer is a waste of hardware and shouldn't come with a premium price tag.. I see what you're saying, but if the battery life suffered because of it everyone would cry foul. If they are slightly limiting performance to get great battery life, I think that makes sense.. ....or they can actually include a bigger battery. They want to be Apple so bad that they strayed from features the Note series were known for (removable big batteries). We'll see how great battery life actually is as more people report in. But aside from that, given the high price tag, this phone should be king right now. If lowly HTC can outperform the number one smartphone manufacturer in the world, then they aren't doing something right.. I'm not a phablet person, but does this user group care about actual battery consumption, or that the bloody thing gets them through their day?. In other words, Samsung just throws in a bigger and bigger battery to offset the main bell curve user consumption rate?. I think the problem is that as technology gets more power efficient, batteries shrink in the name of fashion. The average user might get a full day most of the time, but then have a heavy use day and have to break out a charger to finish the day. I would take an extra 2mm thickness to add a couple hours or more of SOT.. Battery life is far from great. It's just average and this is despite using an all black these.. I'm not making an excuse for Samsung. I was pretty clear this is a downside.. I actually compared the AT&T Note 7 to the international (Exynos) Note 5 and the Note 5 blows the Note 7 out of the water. Also the Note 5 is consistently smooth and lag free.. All Note 5's were Exynos powered not just international ones.. The note 3 had the fastest raw processor power speed. Im assuming when I replace my screen itll be faster than all my other notes in a test. I noticed going to note 4 (forced warranty but free so I accepted) that the game I was playing seemed to a take a few seconds longer to load everytime. Before I didnt see much of a load screen on the note 3. In the tech the single determining factor anyone focuses on is RAW GHZ speed. Android makers hide these numbers and call their crap processors by codenames that are used to confuse people by calling them 'upgrades". How much bloat does this phone have? does it have MAJOR BLOAT like an internet browser, messenger, music player, calendar, file manager, etc? WHY IS THIS NOT ONE OF THE BIGGEST "NOT SO GOOD'S" IN THE REVIEW? WHY DID YOU COMPLETELY PASS OVER HOW MUCH BLOAT IS IN THIS PHONE?. I think the point is; this thing does not perform like a $850 device, because phones half the price seem faster than it in the real world.. Yeah, but people talk about lag this, lag that. I haven't experienced actual lag on a Samsung device, since the S4. The laggiest part of any device are the useless Android animations. I immediately turn all of those off.. Just because you don't notice the lag doesn't mean it isn't there. It generally isn't full-second freezes, it is just that it doesn't manage to render a frame in under the 16.7ms limit for 60 fps and thus it has to drop down to 30 fps for a frame here and there which just doesn't feel smooth.. Aren't Samsung phones currently limited to 44 fps?. And if you don't notice it then you don't give a shit about all this geek millisecond shit!!!. you mean to say that you don't experience lag while using the device as the manufacturer delivered it? You turn off animations, which means you probably do other things to the OS to make it run as you want it to, correct? Reviewers don't typically change a device (by turning off animations and/or other system type tweaks) before reviewing a device AND most common people also don't do that. So, therefore, lag on Samsung (and pretty much any other device) is real.. The only things I do are turn off animations, and use Nova Launcher. I do not root and tweak. Even iOS users can turn off animations. Well, I'll put it this way. My VZW Note5 is COMPLETELY stock (work phone and highly locked down) and it lags regularly. I just received my VZW Note7 yesterday and the same lag is still present. I can get both of them lag when doing anything regarding the radios (WiFi on, BT off, etc) and I can get it to do this repeatedly.. It's not bad enough to say the devices suck, but it's there and it's more noticeable in the Note7.. Can you describe the lag because I'm just not seeing it?. Not so much lag as just slow, especially compared to other devices like the iPhone. That shit has already been debunked. All they did was open 14 apps in rapid succession, hardly a real world test. Even Renee Ritchie from iMore agrees that this isn't indicative of real world use, and shouldn't be taken seriously. He is the biggest iPologist around. The difference comes down to 740p vs 1440p.. maybe, but what was shown was impressive. It definitely opened some apps substantially faster.. No android phones is faster than an Iphone or a Windows Phone.. This phone is said to be slower on many tasks than the Note 5. I'm leaving to buy it now, but they (Samsung) still need to acknowledge their overlay (Touchwiz) can be an obnoxious hog of resources.. "This phone is said to be slower on many tasks than the Note 5", I'm curious where you heard or read that. As you can see on this speedtest video, the Note 7 is faster than the Note 5 (Exynos versions) :. here is another video with a stop watch (Exynos versions) : --https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5rlHhXXtRE. You know the snapdragon versions are slower in term of performance and less efficient in terms of energy consumption than exynos versions. Then I can only advise you to buy the Exynos version. Watch these two videos, the S7 (exynos) beats the G5, HTC 10,Sony Z5, and Huawei p9 , the Iphone still win with 8 second in front of the Gs7 exynos:. In this one it lose at a maximum of 10 seconds in front of the iphone. Iphone 6s vs S7 edge Exynos :. And like i said earlier, this is not the samsung fault, no android phone is faster than an Iphone or a windows phone. If you know an android phone that is faster than an iphone, i'll take it. The Note 7 is a new device the updates can fix many of the issues we can see on all new devices in the market ( it will have updates to fix bugs and improve performance, especially with Android Nougat , there will be good things and more) , like the Oneplus 3 which beat the S7 (exynos) ONLY AFTER an update, but again even this 6gb ram phone can't beat the iphone 6s too.. Even the lag on the S4 disappeared after the 5.0.1 update. It was pretty laggy with 4.x. There are two parts to the problem. The first part is that there just aren't any faster chips available. When a $400 phone also uses the fastest chip, Samsung can't do much to beat that. The other part is that other phones perform better using the same chip, and this is what is actually embarrassing. Just because of Samsung's weak software it lags a lot more than other phones.. Yes, software is a big part of the equation especially when you are charging $850! How about skipping all the 3rd-party and carrier crap at that price point?. It should be embarrassing if even a phone less than half the cost is running faster than the Note 7 not for normal consumers but at least the enthusiast and even some company people.. I'll take outstanding battery over outstanding performance on any day of the week.. If I'm not paying so much money for a phone I demand both. Except the battery isn't really that outstanding over its predecessor or other current flagships either.. Love my note 7, free 256gb sd card is nice too.. I enjoy reading the bitching and moaning from people who don't own one though.. I've got one and it's good but not really much better than the Note 4 which is an amazing phone.. I had the 4, skipped the 5 for the V10 and came back to the 7. This phone, for me, is a ton better than the 4. The ram seemed to be the difference maker, as I had a significant improvement in my experience going to the 4gb ram V10.. Bitching and Moaning ? LOL !! Dude, go and read some articles on XDA about this OVERPRICED trash, OP3, HTC10 are way better than this, Do you dream about the AOSP UX ? Try to atleast dream, since you can never expect shitsung support the development community. Enjoy the SPen at its best and that battery that will last for 12 mnths tops, dump $850 then. Such feelings over a giant corporation and phone.. Which one of those phones have waterproofing, sophisticated note taking software with stylus support, has a killer camera and screen while still having acceptable-to-great battery life with the best accessory ecosystem in the Android market?. Sorry, some of us make our phone decisions on slightly more practical grounds than "muh stock UI". The Note 7 compliments my life much, much better than a stock Android phone does, and I can attest to this as I retired my 3rd gen Moto G for the note, and that was a phone that was meant to be temporary but I fell in love with.. This is how most people will think, samsung will still sell millions and the likes of the idiot commentator above you will be just that... an idiot pissing about things that dont matter to 99.5 percent of people, in real life.. Yeah seems like you had my piss in your mouth, tastes bad ah ?. Grow up kid this is Internet not your mum's storybook.. My comment was not targeted at people like you, I hope you get the best out of Note7 but as for me I cannot give 850$ for a locked gadget.. Quick launching memos from any on screen and a large set of tools to make adding images and information easy as hell. These are things that are extremely valuable to have when you are looking at a phone as a tool, and there are literally no phones that offer this sort of functionality outside of the note line.. Lol, why do you get mad when someone else spends his/her money on a phone? Fine, you would buy something else were it your money, we get it.. Kids like that? They thrive on posting like this :p. Empty vessels make the greatest sound and all that.. I'd choose TouchWiz over either of those in a heatbeat.. I wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole or wizz on it if it was on fire.. The $850 probably doesn't bother the majority of users who probably got them "subsidized" through "contracts" - lol!. It's nice hardware, but typical Sammy tripe.. It's getting closer to Apple all the time as a fashion accessory.. Except Apple will support their devices for up to 5 years... Just because Apple puts the latest iOS version number on older devices doesn't mean it comes with the latest features or works properly.. Yep! My iPad 2 running iOS 9.3 lags worse than TouchWiz ever did. infact i think they support older devices on purpose so that they can make them slower and unusable hence forcing an upgrade!!!. They did not do this with original iPad.. So you prefer the Nexus phone with the crappy NAND and feel smart about it?. What i mean, make ur fucking choices but dont act like a king bro, everything has a good and bad side. Too many really good phones out there in all strata to tremendously overpay for Sammy's rep as a status icon.. I said the "edge" was a gimmick, for example, and I'd be embarrassed to use one, but it was voted the most "beautiful" phone - but no accounting for taste.. If you dig them, then more power to you.. You cant deny the fact that in some aspects, Samsung is ahead. Like the camera and the screen. And yes, i totally love the edge screen on my s6. I bought a used s6 edge a month ago, my first ever Samsung device.. Not good enough to replace my N5X (for many reasons )but i love some aspects of the phone, internal memory is fast, screen is amazing, camera is blazing fast, TWIZ animations are nice.. Curious to know why it is not yet good enough? What features are missing?. N5X is cheaper, N5X already has Nougat, N5X makes better HDR+ pics (way better), N5X does not have a physical button.. The button is subjective though, i hate onscreen buttons. All depends from user to user.. I prefer capacitive buttons too, but a physical button is another story. I think I said the hardware is great (maybe somewhere else) and the design is less offensive than the Note 5's, but laggy kb (and other stuff) with a 820? That would drive me nuts.. And I also admit that of you need a stylus, it's the only viable option - and I do like built-in styluses, but I can't overcome all of the weirdness of TouchWhiz, lag, etc.. I know because I've tried very hard to use other phones (I've bought and got rid of about a dozen phones in the last year) that I *loved* on paper, but the little things that annoyed me overpowered the things that I did like about them. I've had a 6P, P9, V10, Pure, honor, Blu, X Play, a couple Chinese OEM ones from Geek Buying, and a couple others, and some didn't even last 24 hours (the Leica P9 - the camera was positively average) )but the only ones that make me happy are my 6P and the Pure. So I'm pre-emtively hating on the Note7 because I know it would irritae me and I listed the main things that I know annoy me right off the bat.. Oh, and the 5X is awesome little phone, too - I've put a couple people into them and they rave about them.. Did u try a Xiaomi one?. Cause if Mi5 had a good camera, it would be my No1 option.. Not yet, but I'm reading more about them.. I have a Redmi 3 device, miui totally rules.. I wouldn't say miles ahead for the camera. The honor 8 has a camera which is pretty much just as good as the note 7. Nexus phones usually have good NAND chips. The W/R speeds are slowed by the lack of HW encryption and forced SW encryption.. I indeed remember reading an article about 6p being faster without encryption but still significantly slower than same-gen phones. I hope HTC vastly improves with new Nexii. A HW encryption module would solve so many problems. The iPhone has one and no one complains about encryption slowing the NAND speeds.. Apple is showing the way with their configuration. They are crazy fast on their internal NAND. I used my N6 with and without encryption for months at a time and I can tell you that I could not tell the difference. I'm super picky when it comes to performance, which is why I decrypted it, but when I flashed a factory image and encrypted it again, I couldn't tell the difference.. What I can tell the difference with is regularly cleaning cache/junk, running TRIM and restarting my phone once a week. My N6 is really fast this way. My wife's 5X feels like molasses next to it.. N6's NAND was slow with or without encryption, i owned that phone for a year. Now i own a 5x, it is slow too.. I also own an S6 edge and the difference is obvious, its' NAND is way faster. UFS simply blows everything else out of the water.. People are always hating on Samsung devices and TouchWiz. But keep in mind that wih stock android stuff like heartbeat tracker, all S-Pen features, camera modes, fingerprint scanner, Edge features won't work.. Also their own made apps all have fingerprint support (like logging in on websites) en specific features for the S-pen.. And they always seem to be a big inspiration for Google themselves it seems.. I hope this version of Touchwiz and apps comes to the S6 and S7. "People are always hating on Samsung devices and TouchWiz. mind that wih stock android stuff like heartbeat tracker, all S-Pen. features, camera modes, fingerprint scanner, Edge features won't work.". Samsung could add all that stuff to stock Android with no skin but they just don't want to do that. FYI Android has fingerprint APIs but no they aren't going to support proprietary things that would only work on Samsung phones.. Alsmost every OEM does those things. Skins, lunchers, overrided sytemUI, lockscreen and keyboards.. When you buy a non Nexus device you always get the 'OEM experience' with it. People buying a Samsung a device are buying that experience.. Yes it was horrible, slow and ugly when I had a S3 but things have come a long way.. As for fingerprints, every OEM had to implement their own API since it is only baked in since M. Just like N bakes multiwindow in it, which I already had on my S3 years ago. Ehh...I don't really mind TW as it currently is, I just can't take the deceptive nature of Samsung marketing. The devices look goo, but are poorer in engineering and development quality than an iPhone, yet are extremely expensive.. You put out nearly a grand for a device that only looks nice...looks like it's supremely engineered and developed. Samsung, always ahead of Google with features by 5 years.. To be honest all this complaint about Touch Wiz is a little unnecessary because there are just so many variants of interface out there lol. People just get use to what they use. What i want to see from future samsung phone are 4K for VR. And goddamn they need to fix that rejection sense on the bezel because that's pretty poor. My Note7 is a very good device but at this point, I would rank it a bit behind my GS7 Edge. Without doing any power saving shenanigans, my Edge kicks the Note7's butt on battery life and that plus price differential has my Note7 ranked below the Edge.. How does your S7 compare to your edge and Note? /s. The space for that S-Pen probably came at the expense of battery. Can't sacrifice thinness for any reason.. A device that is $850 but is slower than other SD820 phones and still includes dozens of bonus carrier and 3rd-party apps that can't be uninstalled. Not to mention the design "changes" are just smaller bezels... Looks like the 2013 LG design team was fired for lacking imagination after the G2 and were then hired by Samsung. Imagine there is a team paid actual real money for this stale design... Can't they just close their design department and admit they aren't changing anything?. it's a new device with new software, Samsung is always quick to optimize its software in updates. Very little bloatware barring the standard ones on the international issue.. 96 bloatware apps and services on the international version to be exact (according to Samsung package disabler). The intl version has less bloat? Like won't have that Cheetah rubbish?. poor folks who cant afford the s7 / note 7 = samsung sucks !. That's funny since Samsung devices are generally more "affordable" than Nexus devices since they're available through carriers with payment plans. I'm pretty sure 99% of people buying these in the US would much prefer (and do) to pay ~$30ish/month than $400+ up front for a new phone.. No matter how rich you are, money is a finite resource so everyone must prioritize their desires. Most people here can afford an $850 phone, considering most people here also own a car that is much more expensive. The question is if the Note7 is that much better than the 6P that it's worth throwing down an extra $400 for the marginal difference in specs. And the answer for me is no, but obviously other people have different priorities or else Samsung wouldn't be able to sell any. I prioritize cars so I'm ok with throwing down money on my BMW instead but some people would rather get a lot of gadgets or clothes for the same price.. Trying to discredit others' opinions by calling them "poor" is a childish attempt at an ad hominem attack. I think one of our Presidential candidates does a good job showing how money != wisdom.. Gah, at that price i can't even justify forming an opinion about it, cool as it might be :(. My brother bought the S7 (non-edge) even that has major problems with compatibility of screen protectors due to its slight curve edges on the glass. Even though it has less curve then s7 edge. I hate every design aspect of these new samsung phones. All glass is so delicate and it also makes the phone heavy and slippery its like they want us to drop it.. so you're forced to put a case on (though i always have a case with any phone). But the screen protector issues bug me like crazy. And as always samsung software will be janky and bloated as it always has been. I have the regular s7 and I love it.. ...that is slower than last year's iPhone 6S, has poor engineering development and is fragile.. You can't really compare ios to android, it's different to the very core. Ios most probably capable of beating any android in term of speed, not only Samsung phones. It's because ios kills all background apps activities during multitasking while android just let it run freely so it requires more power and resources to operate. I also kinda agree with you about the note being overpriced, but on the other hand can you tell me another phone that has arguably best screen, best camera, fast charging, fast wireless charging, MST, s-pen, iris scanner all that complete package in a gorgeous water resistant body?. Keep on saying it's fragile despite drop tests proving otherwise. Maybe if you keep saying it, it'll be true.. You should check the web for Note 7 drop tests.. Maybe you should take your own advice. It's no Moto or Active, but it's hardly fragile. But yeah, by all means, keep on bleating about the supposed fragility.. I've already read this article a few days ago:. >taking risks with materials and designs. only if you use their theme engine!. Cheetah Mobile can be disabled with a package disabler. Once you disable the "Device Maintenance" package you get the old settings menu where you can view battery, storage and RAM usage, as well as enable the old power saving modes.. Can we please stop calling this phone expensive? I don't see reviews saying "iPhone 6s plus (a very expensive phone)".. Because the iPhone 6s plus were (and still are) expensive. Look at almost every review when they came out and you'll see the same thing. Any phone that retails for over $1,000 is expensive. Hell, any phone that retails for over $500 is expensive.. Yeah but this phone comes with 64gb storage, the 6s plus comes with 16gb .. Actually, for a 64gb iPhone6S+, it's $849. Almost the exact same price as the Note7.. Unfortunately, one thing that can't be disputed is that iPhones keep their resale value. That's how they can still charge that outrageous amount a year later.. And the note 7 has a fantastic screen and better specs.. Yeah guys, can we please stop? Just because it costs more doesn't mean it's more expensive!. It's always been an expensive phone, everyone is making it sound like it's breaking news.. No one calls the iPhone expensive because it is the only option in the market for iOS phones. On the other side, the Note 7 competes with a slew of other phones in the Android marketplace. Given the low prices and high performance of phones with equal or lower specs, the Note 7 is expensive. Love this phone, got it on launch date :). Still prefer the S7 Edge Exynos ;). You missed a major (in my mind) negative: The Action Memo app was removed. You can no longer jot a phone #, address, or link and get prompted to open the dialer, maps, or browser. That, to me, was one major benefit of owning the Note. I won't spend (waste) my money on another Samsung device.. I believe you can download the "S Note" app from the PlayStore and get the action memo working. The new note app is worse than S Note, judging from the reviews on the app page.. Once again, Samsung is it's own worst enemy, causing problems where there should be none. I have owned this device for 6 days, and have a love hate relationship with Samsung. I consider myself a tech lover and buy way too many phones. I typically buy new phones every few months. The Note 7 ticks so many of the right boxes, but Samsung can't help themselves buy making their skins too resource hungry. They take 1 step forward and 2 steps back. This phone is quite possibly the best looking phone ever made. (Matter of opinion) Has the best display and camera on the market. (Not an opinion) However the phone still has extremely poor RAM management that was originally fixed with my S7 and S7 edge. (See I buy too many phones) It made my S6 edge slow to a crawl at times. The battery life is goes from great to poor depending on the day, not the usage. Which comes from bad RAM management and I'm sure poor app writing. The phone lags at times and is a speed demon the next. All you have to do is watch the iPhone 6s vs Note 7 speed test to see how slow this phone can be. If you buy the phone I really recommend doing a factory reset before setting your device up. This does improve things for some. Something is happening when the phones hit the carriers and they load all of their startups and bloatware. I'm on Verizon and they removed free features like Samsung Cloud to push their paid Verizon Cloud among others. I'm thinking a class action lawsuit is in order to knock big red down a few pegs. No company should have a right to remove a feature from a phone you purchase to have it replaced with a paid service of theirs. That's like buying a new car and then finding out the dealer took the engine out and replaced it with theirs and then charged you extra for it. I know I got a little side tracked, but for a $900 phone I expect way more. I'll give it a few more days after a factory reset to see if that will help. Some days my battery was at 50% and only 1 hr of SOT and then when I would look at the battery stats it would show Android OS at 15% usage and Android System at 18-25%. I think they really could have fixed some of this with 6GB of RAM.. I've had my AT&T Samsung galaxy note 7 for 6 days. It's generally the fastest phone I've ever used but has incredibly bad intermittent lag in pretty much ever application. When the lag happens it's so sever and annoying, and it happens pretty frequently. It's probably got worse and the keyboard started lagging too after I applied the AT&T OTA update.. I've swapped out the phone and spent countless hours trying to fix the problem to no avail.. I seriously need to see this lag. I'm just not having that happen.. The stock keyboard sucks anyway - but I don't have this lag either on mine.. Where did you get ur Note5 from?? eBay?? 3 months later?? No way was it $700 at launch, on AT&T the 64GB Note was $840 and the Verizon Note5 64GB was $800.. Glad i'm always a generation or two behind. Just scored a 64GB S6 Edge + for 200 mint and it's (a lot of phone and) all good. By the time i'm interested in the Note 7 (would be 1/3rd the price it is now), the Note 8-and-half would be launching.. 850 dollars, excluding tax, for a cell phone..yeah right. I'd rather fellate a cactus plant in slow motion.. Why do people think this phone is so expensive? No one complains about the price of the iPhone 6+ that I see though. It's the same price with less features... I think the price is about what I'd expect.. Probably because with iPhones you get a better experience. Samsung, LG, HTC don't offer the services and customer relations Apple has. I have a note5 and an iPad... If my note5 has an issue, I have to google a fix (because I have the international version). When my 3 year old (bought in Germany) iPad's battery started faltering, I went to the local Apple Store in Dallas, TX and got it fixed for free. I love android, but they can't match that.. To be honest the part where you mention about accidental touch on the curve display is HUGE. I wasn't going to get this phone originally due to the low resolution for VR but after hearing about this problem with the bezels curve i am definitely not touching this phone until they fix this.. This rarely happens to me on my Note 7. I'd only be concerned about it if you were going to get a S7 edge.. Sure its slow, and it has like 80 bloatware apps, and that it costs twice as much as the competition... It's so pretty to look at, and the S-Pen is a joy to use!. I'm not blown away so far, but its definitely an upgrade over my OP3, especially since I really really missed the capabilities and convenience of the Note series.. I owned the Note 4 for 18 months and was very happy with it, it’s an amazing phone, but on impulse I bought the Note 7. To be honest, it was a needless and frivolous purchase.. Yes it’s a bit smaller, looks nicer, and takes a bit better pictures, but that’s pretty much it.. It doesn’t really do anything the Note 4 doesn’t do, other than look more ‘premium’. But the Note 4 is an amazing piece of work, really it has everything you want from a phone.. The fingerprint reader is easier and quicker to use on the Note 7, but the iris scanner is pointless as it’s more fiddly and takes longer to unlock, no one will ever really use it.. The camera is better on the 7, but the Note 4 already took amazing photos, so it’s just incremental really. The screen looks nicer on the 7 too, but again incrementally so.. I succumbed to the rave reviews and stupidly bought on impulse while a bit drunk. The Note 7 is a great phone if the phone you have now isn’t that good. But honestly, if you have the Note 4 or 5, it is definitely not good enough to warrant spending $800 on what are really minor upgrades. I’m an idiot for buying it, I admit it.. Footnote: I did get the Gear VR with it, and that is really awesome, purely because it’s amazing to watch Netflix with it, it’s like having a cinema in your bedroom.. I use it often (iris scanner) and it has been very fast for me.. Iris scanner is extremely fast- I use it a lot. Down is the swipe up on the lock screen to activate it.. Well If we follow all your logic, we can also say that if we have a Note 3, it is not worth buying a Note 4, "just" because "It doesn’t really do anything the Note 3 doesn’t do". We can say exactly the same for the Note 3 over the Note 4. Why did you buy the Note 4 then? The answer is simple, because you find that the Note 4 is more advanced, simply. So The Note 7 is more advanced than the Note 4, that's the fact.. -The iris scanner, obviously, it's not made to unlock your phone when you can use the fingersprint scanner, but it may be very useful, when you have wet fingers ( pool, bathroom, kitchen) , or when you have gloves in winter; situations where you can not use the fingerprint scanner. "But honestly, if you have the Note 4 or 5, it is definitely not good enough to warrant spending $800 on what are really minor upgrades". Let me put things in perspective : so if I am a person who purchased the Note 5 to its release date where it was costing between 749$ and 799$ in 32gb, you say that for $ 50 or 100$ more this year , I would have a device with twice of the memory (64gb> 32gb) with the return of the sacrosanct Port SD up to 256gb, a better screen with HDR, a bigger battery, better CPU / GPU more powerful of the order of at least 50% to 70% with the API vulkan compability, water and dust resistance, USB type C, an iris scanner, a more precise Spen with twice the pressure levels (4096> 2048), a better camera, all in a better design and you tell me that it's not worth ? OK... Coming from a Note, these upgrades are more greater, in terms of performance and user experience. In The hardware side we can talk about performances which are largely rising, even at the level of connectivity (LTE, Bluetooth, WiFi), experience around Spen is 5 times better, and we can still argue like that a long time, but one thing is on and you even you admit a half word: Note 7 is a better device than the Note 4 and 5.. I've had the Note 5 for a year now--it's a fantastic phone, but WAY overpriced.. OK so I disabled S Health, S Voice and Samsung + and it is significantly smoother now. I think it's time for a Samsung manufactured Nexus phone again!. You should also mention the poor repairability and the scratchy screen.. I really wish they would start using different chips than the S series.... Hey Ryan, does this phone have bloat like calander, messaging app, and other things? Why isn't this a major disadvantage to this phone?!. It's $850 for the phone but they are throwing in a $180 fitness tracker if you buy it early. So realistically the phone is much less if you add in those factors. You can always wait 6 months and get the phone for $200 cheaper. I upgraded from my S7 edge to the note 7 and I'm loving it. I dont use the S pen a lot but I do enjoy the larger screen. And it seems like the battery is lasting me longer than on my S7 edge (bit this could be because it's new). People complaining about a phone that is bleeding with specs, that give you 64gb standard, and throw in a 256gb memory card (instead of the gear fit 2) should ask themselves, how much would apple charge for a 320gb iPhone with a 1080p display and no headphone jack?. That fitness tracker thing only really applies if you were planning on buying it anyway. You can say you only paid $670 for the phone any day of the week, but you are still out $850. I guess you can try to resell it and make up the costs, but you won't get anywhere near $180 for the tracker.. Phones like the OnePlus 3 and Axon 7 make this phone really hard to justify.. After my 1st OTA firmware update , my Note 7's finger print sensor is super fast! Once pressed the home button and immediately release my thumb, it unlocked! 👍👍👍. Why is the international version Exynos? Any explication?. Hope always on display update will come to S7. Looks like it should have been like that from the beginning.. Does turning on airplane mode still tell you what airplane mode is (via a pop-up that must be dismissed), every time?. Love this phone but wouldn't consider buying one for over $800. It is doomed to failure and needs to sell for $600 or less. I am looking for other great phones at a reasonable price.. I wonder how the Exynos version would fare against the SD820 ones... Can you please share your impressions if its DAC?. I would love the have the build quality of a Galaxy, but with the near demise of carrier subsidies, I am not willing to spend $650-850 on a phone. Which is why I bought a Nexus 5X.. Having stock Android is a bonus, too.. In the tech world where geeks and engineers come from we dont play by google and Apple scam jobs. The note 3 has a faster processor than all notes on paper. And That 'paper' its on is the only numbers that even matter when a tech genius purchases a new $600 gfx card or $600 processor. Its called GHZ and its the ONLY thing that matters really to most people who use computers to build space ships, or cars, or roads, watch videos, edit videos, or just game or whatever it is..
