Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed.

Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime, Galaxy J7 Prime First Impressions. Ketan Pratap , 20 September 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Galaxy J7 Prime is now available in India priced at Rs. The Galaxy J5 Prime goes on sale in late September priced at Rs. Both models run Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Samsung's Galaxy J-series smartphones have received decent response from the Indian market. The company registered a 10.9 percent growth over the previous quarter and 15 percent growth from the same period last year. According to a recent IDC data , updated versions of the Galaxy J2, J5, and J7 smartphones drove shipments in Q2 2016. The South Korean company, in an attempt to further cash in on the popularity of its J-series, has unveiled two new models - the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime and Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime .. Both new Samsung smartphones feature the same design, with fingerprint scanners and all-metal bodies. The company is also heavily promoting India-specific "smart" features such as S Power Planning and S Secure which have been developed by Samsung's R&D centres in India.. Talking about the new J-series smartphones, Manu Sharma, Vice President, Mobiles Business, Samsung India told Gadgets 360 that the new "smart" features were inspired by insights from the company's wide range of consumers. Sharma stressed that the new features are 'Make for India' innovations. We spent some time with the new Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime and Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime at a private media briefing on Monday, and here are our first impressions.. Before diving into the specifics of the new Galaxy J7 Prime and J5 Prime, we have to talk about the new S Power Planning & S Secure features that have been designed keeping Indian consumers in mind. S Power Planning makes its debut on the new J7 Prime and J5 Prime smartphones, and seems targeted at young users.. S Power Planning includes three features: Reserve Battery Capacity for calls, which allows the user to allocate a certain percentage of the battery for calls and messages; Extend Battery Time, which has three power-saving levels to choose from; and Forward Calls, which lets users forward calls to another number when the phone runs out of power. Extend Battery Time can give users up to twice the usual amount of battery life, as per a Samsung representative, but several phone features are disabled. S Power Planning could definitely come in handy for everyday use, as there will always be times when we forget or are unable to charge our phones ahead of a very busy day.. The second highlight feature is S Secure, which is focused on security and privacy. It includes options to lock and hide apps, secure folders with a fingerprint, and encrypt data being transferred over public Wi-Fi hotspots. The Secure Folder feature has been seen before, on the Galaxy Note 7 .. Samsung has also included its S Bike mode on both the new smartphones. S Bike mode made its debut earlier this year on the Galaxy J3 (6) and is based around the core idea that two-wheeler riders should not be distracted by incoming calls. For user convenience, Samsung has placed the S Power Planning, S Secure, and S Bike mode toggles in the Quick Settings panel by default.. The all-metal Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime and J5 Prime both look sturdy. They also both feel slightly heavy for their sizes - the J7 Prime weighs 167 grams and J5 Prime comes in at 143 grams. The front of both phones is 2.5D rounded-edge Corning Gorilla Glass which gives them a premium feel. The signature home button can be seen upfront placed between the Recents and Back capacitive buttons. The home button on both the phones also embed the fingerprint scanner. Each phone has its power button on the right and volume rocker on the left. The 3.5mm audio jack and Micro-USB charging port are on the bottom. There is a company logo on the top above each phone's display, plus more branding at the back. Thanks to the phones' curved edges, we had no issues holding either the J7 Prime or the J5 Prime.. The phones' rears seem plain other than the primary camera and accompanying LED flash on each one. There are two lines running across the top and bottom of the back panel.. Running Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the Galaxy J7 Prime and J5 Prime use Samsung's own TouchWiz skin, and they come with the usual apps from Google. Both models also have Microsoft suite of apps including Office apps and Skype preinstalled, among others. As before, users can delete the Microsoft apps if they choose to. The icons for the dialler, contacts, messages, and browser are pinned on bottom of the display, and the app drawer is to their right. The quick settings panel includes the usual toggles for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular data, torch, power saving, flight mode, and more. Samsung might have cut down on the number of its own apps but a few still made it to the device, including MyGalaxy and Samsung Notes.. The Galaxy J7 Prime features a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920-pixel) IPS display with 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass, and it runs on a 1.6GHz octa-core processor coupled with 3GB of RAM. The screen looked bright and crisp. We found legibility to be decent even in direct sunlight, with good viewing angles.. The Galaxy J5 Prime features a 5-inch HD (720x1280-pixel) IPS display with 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass, and runs on a 1.4GHz quad-core processor coupled with 2GB of RAM. The display on the J5 Prime was also vibrant and bright, with decent visibility under the sun. We feel that of the two phones, the J7 Prime has a better screen. In the time we spent getting acquainted with both the Galaxy J7 Prime and J5 Prime, we found that the smartphones were pretty responsive to touch inputs and were quick during multitasking. We will reserve our final verdict on the performance of Samsung's new Galaxy J7 Prime and J5 Prime till we get a chance to put them through their paces in a thorough review.. The Galaxy J7 Prime sports a 13-megapixel rear camera with f/1.9 aperture and an LED flash. There is an 8-megapixel front camera as well. In our brief camera tests, we found images taken with the J7 Prime in normal indoor lighting to be crisp with decent colour reproduction on the phone's screen. The front camera was able to take good selfies. The Galaxy J5 Prime also sports a 13-megapixel rear camera with autofocus, f/1.9 aperture and an LED flash, but has a 5-megapixel front camera. We found the images clicked by J5 Prime under artificial lighting to also be quite crisp, with a good amount of detail. We did however notice slight blurring in the corners of images. The front camera took decent shots. Even so, do stay tuned for our detailed J7 Prime and J5 Prime review, when we will really get a chance to test the camera under varied conditions.. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime and Galaxy J5 Prime have been launched at Rs. The Galaxy J7 Prime is now available in India while the J5 Prime will go on sale by end of this month.. At these prices, the new Galaxy J7 Prime and J5 Prime will be taking on popular handsets such as the Moto G4 Plus , Nextbit Robin , and Lenovo Vibe X3. Stay tuned to Gadgets 360 for a full review of the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime and J5 Prime..

REVIEW OVERVIEW Design Display Software UI Performance Hardware Camera Fingerprint Connectivity Battery SUMMARY. Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime Review: A complete package in Rs. If you’re not impressed by the specs and performance of the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime, here are some other options for you:. 2016 has to be the year of the ‘budget phones’ in Nepal. It saw the release of some mid-range proper ‘bang-for-buck’ devices. And even though the year is about to end, smartphone manufacturers and distributors show no sign of stopping. Nepal’s bestselling smartphone company – Samsung is doing just the same.. Samsung recently released a new mid-range device – the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime. A successor to the Samsung Galaxy J5 2016, the device follows Samsung’s trend of releasing new and improved version of its previously released devices. 22,990, Can the J5 Prime stand out against the competition? Lets find out on our review.. The Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime’s back design is different than any of Samsung’s previous phones as it features a camera and a LED flash at the back with its speaker on the right side. The device sports a glossy metal back with plastic top and bottom for antenna bands. It is thin, and looks and feels premium.At the front, the Galaxy J5 Prime features a typical Samsung smartphone’s design. There is an earpiece at the top along with a front facing camera, and a proximity and accelerometer sensor on its side. On the bottom chin rests a home button, a recent app switcher and a back button. The recent app switcher and the back button aren’t backlit. I had a hard time using these buttons in the dark. It would have been better if Samsung had at least made the buttons backlit.. On the left side, there’s a power button and a speaker grill. Yes, the speaker grill is actually on the side, right above the power button. Volume rockers, SIM slot and a microSD card slot sit on the left side of the device. The bottom of the device features a USB Type-B port, a headphone jack and a primary mic. It lacks a secondary mic for active noise cancellation.. It weighs at 143g and while the metal back and the design of the Galaxy J5 Prime is really good, the device is quite slippery. So, I would suggest you get a case right away.. The Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime flaunts a sleek 5-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels with 294 for the pixels per inch (PPI). Even though the device lacks an AMOLED panel and a 1080p screen, the screen is bright and colorful. It also lacks an ambient sensor but there’s an outdoor mode for watching the display under bright light. The outdoor feature does its work nicely as I had no problem using the device under direct sunlight. Viewing angle is quite decent as well.. Even with the device sporting a 720p screen, the display can go up against some of the 1080p displays. Not that I’m complaining or anything, but Samsung should have gone with an AMOLED display. The display would be more vibrant and the color reproduction would have been better. It is a bummer that the Samsung Galaxy J1 2016 , a device worth 11,300, features a Super AMOLED display whereas a device worth 22,990 has gone with an IPS LCD display.. On the software side, the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime ships with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box. The device comes with Touch Wiz UI on top. Previously, Samsung was criticized for its laggy and clogged interface. But the UI has come a long way as the company toned down TouchWiz and ditched lots of its bloatware. The device comes with a few pre-loaded Samsung apps which can be disabled. It also has preinstalled Microsoft Office apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Skype among others. The Galaxy J5 Prime does feature SBike mode, and Samsung’s S Power planning and S Secure.. Even though I like a stock Android experience, I had no problem using the UI of the device. But it would have been better if Samsung made it simpler and toned down the interface of the applications. Other than this, the software front of the device is snappy and lag-free.. Under the hood, the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime is powered by an Exynos 7570 Quad-core 1.43 GHz Cortex-A53 64-bit processor that is aided by a Mali-T720 GPU and 2GB RAM. The device didn’t lag under normal usage, and after heavy usage, there were minor stutters while using different apps. I should mention that sometimes while gaming, the screen just freezes.. So, if you’re not heavy into gaming, the Exynos 7570 Quad-core processor and the 2GB RAM will handle your everyday task quite nicely.. On the hardware front, the device features 16GB of onboard storage. While 16GB of storage option might be sufficient to some, it wasn’t enough for me at all. Fortunately, there is a microSD card slot that helps to expand the storage up to 256GB. Its speaker is a setback because it is not loud at all and gets covered when using the device in landscape mode. I previously thought ‘speaker at the back’ was the worst placement for a speaker grill, but the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime made me change my mind. The device has a USB Type-B port for connectivity and charging purpose. The Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime is equipped with a 13-megapixel rear facing camera with f/1.9 aperture. Under bright light, the camera does its job well and takes good pictures. The macro shots and wide-angle shots are good. However, during macro shots, the camera had a hard time focusing on any object. Like all devices of its price range, the Galaxy J5 Prime underperforms under low light as the pictures get noisy and grainy.. The front facing camera of the device is of 5-megapixel with f/2.2 aperture. It takes some good social media ready pictures in a well-lit environment. Like the primary camera, it too suffers in dark. But in the dark, there is an option that makes the screen glow brightly like the ones seen on iPhones.. The camera app comes with features like Panorama, HDR and beauty face among others. There is a pro-mode which lets you toggle the ISO, White Balance and Exposure. It also lets you choose effects like Sepia, Greyscale, etc.. The Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime’s home button at the front serves as a fingerprint sensor. It is fast and easy to set up, with an option of adding multiple fingerprints. At first, the sensor did not function properly, judging every touch as ‘No match’. But as time passed, it started to adapt to my fingerprints and now I can unlock the device without any hiccups.. The Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime has dual SIM slots for two GSM Nano-SIM cards. Other connectivity options include WiFi b/g/n, GPS, Bluetooth v4.2, hotspot and FM Radio. The absence of NFC might discourage some buyers though.. The Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime has a non-removable 2400mAh battery under the hood. Under heavy usage, which included navigating through the internet, watching videos and movies, and playing games constantly with lots of apps running in the background, the device got me a screen-on-time of 5 hours. Under moderate usage, the Galaxy J5 Prime lasted for a day and half. So, if you’re a heavy user, the device will last long without having to worry about charging it again and again. The only bummer is the absence of a removable back as there is no Quick charge.. Even with the increasing number of new smartphone manufacturers and distributors setting their roots in Nepal, Samsung is still the bestselling device here. It sells some bang-for-buck devices, and that trend looks set to continue with the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime. Even though its hardware specs are similar to some of the devices in the lower price range, the display, build quality, performance and camera are second to none.. Except for its rare stutters and poor functioning camera under low light, overall the device is quite snappy. And just as its name suggests, it is a prime smartphone in its price range. You won’t regret your decision if you spend your hard-earned cash to buy the Samsung J5 Prime.. 24,500, the Huawei GR5 offers a better rear camera, and a bigger battery than that of the Galaxy J5 Prime. However, quality of the 720p display is almost equal to the quality of the 1080p display Huawei GR5 possesses.. 27,999, the Redmi Note 3 Pro offers excellent performance with Snapdragon 650 SoC under the hood. It also offers a good 16MP rear facing camera and a huge 4100mAh battery.. Featuring an excellent design and a great battery life, the Meizu M3 Note is another good choice. However, the device’s camera is not good and the performance is average. One of Gionee’s best smartphones, the Gionee S6s combines attractive looks, excellent build quality, superb front camera, and Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box to go with an attractive price tag of Rs. Having said that, you will compromise in 3 areas: performance, rear camera, and fast charging.. Previous article DJI Mavic Pro launched in Nepal for Rs.

Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime (2017) leaked specs include Exynos-based chipset, 3GB RAM. by Cosmin Vasile. Tags :. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. Besides the entry-level Galaxy J2 Pro (2018) that we reported about a few days ago, Samsung is likely to launch another cheap smartphone by the end of the year, the Galaxy J5 Prime (2017). Well, the name isn't official yet, but there's a high chance that the leaked device is a sequel to the Galaxy J5 Prime, also known as Samsung SM-G570. The unannounced device that has been recently listed at GFXBench has a consequential model number, SM-G571, which is why we believe it to be a follow-up to the Galaxy J5 Prime. The sequel to the Galaxy J5 Prime is expected to pack a 1.4GHz quad-core Exynos 7570 processor, 3GB RAM, and 32GB internal memory. Also, the listing mentions a 4.8-inch HD (720p) display, a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera and a secondary 8-megapixel camera in the front. Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime (2017) runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat, but the final version might ship with Oreo if the South Korean company thinks it will sell better that way.

Mobiles / Samsung Mobile Phones / Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 624 Compare. Samsung has been able to snatch back the losing market by launching a couple of new mid-range and budget segment lineup. The Galaxy J series of handset has been a mass favorite for a lot of Indian buyers. This has led the handset maker to come up with different variants of its already existing smartphones. One of the best handset in the Galaxy J Series has to be the Galaxy J5 Prime. Here is a brief overview of the handset for those who are interested in this device.. Impressive Camera : While the camera on this handset is just 13 megapixels, we still feel that it is one of the best around. One of the main reasons behind it is the fact that the camera has been equipped with an aperture of 1.9, which means it takes in more light and produces some impressive images. The front camera is a 5 Megapixel unit that too comes with a wide angle lens for capturing more detail.. Fingerprint scanner : This feature is considered to be a brownie point by many users when it comes to budget smartphones under INR 15,000. Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime comes with the same fingerprint scanner on the front panel that Samsung is famous for.. S-Power planning : One of the biggest worry for any smartphone user is to run out of the battery before the day ends and having to fish for the charger. However, the S-Power Planning feature of the handset comes to the rescue. It not only helps in preserving the battery but also forward your calls to a pre-determined number when the handset is low on juice.. Poor Battery : While the S-Power is definitely a boon for many, however it is no excuse for a poor battery driving the handset. Samsung Galaxy J Prime comes with a minuscule 2400 mAh battery, which would run out more frequently.. Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime Price in India. Black +1 Variants. 11,730 .00.
