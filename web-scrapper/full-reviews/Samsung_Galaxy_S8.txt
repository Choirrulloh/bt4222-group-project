CNET también está disponible en español.. The most beautiful phone ever has one wildly annoying issue. Samsung Galaxy S8 (64GB, Orchid Gray). Samsung Galaxy S8 (64GB, Arctic Silver). Samsung Galaxy S8 (64GB, Midnight Black). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The best-looking phone around crushes it in performance, battery life, water-resistance and wireless charging. An external storage slot lets you keep more photos, videos and music.. The Bad Its awkwardly placed fingerprint reader leads to camera smears and longer unlock times, which is aggravating when you use it to unlock your phone dozens of times a day.. The Bottom Line The Samsung Galaxy S8's fast speeds and fantastic curved screen make it a top phone for 2017, but the annoying fingerprint reader could sour your experience.. US pricing details, by carrier UK pricing details, by carrier Australian pricing details, by carrier What I've noticed since my initial review A case helps make the fingerprint reader easier to hit, but there are a lot of false scans compared to the Google Pixel and Huawei phones like the P10, Honor 8, etc. Top-level controls in the native camera app's manual mode are easy to access, so that's good The sides of some games and apps cut off when you go full-screen (Clash of Clans is one example) I'm not loving the jerky scrolling on the Recents tab If you use a third-party app to remap the Bixby button (like Bixby Remapper), you might notice lag using it All-new design is thumbs-up. The S8 falters when you give it the finger(print). The Samsung Galaxy S8 is without a doubt the most beautiful, polished phone I've ever held. These words were true when I first reviewed it in April, and are still true a month on. I do have some additional insights since then -- scroll down a bit for those.. OK, so the S8 is pretty. But it's also the most important Samsung phone right now, at least until the Galaxy Note 8 comes along. It's been helping restore buyers' confidence after the double Note 7 battery disaster (the S8's apparently selling like hotcakes ), and it's a chance to cement the Samsung name as the top Android brand against upcoming rivals: the pure Android Google "Pixel 2," squeezable HTC U11 and cut-price OnePlus 5. It helps that soon, you'll be able to use the Galaxy S8 in Google's Daydream headset .. What makes the Galaxy S8 so special is this: A tall, narrow shape that fits snugly in my palm and curved sides that scream "classy." And the screen? 5.8 inches of colorful gorgeousness with a display that stretches from edge to edge with just a whisper of a bezel. For its looks alone, Samsung's flashiest phone lands at the top of the class. Trust me, when you see the S8 and larger, pricier S8 Plus , you're gonna want to put your hands all over them.. I did everything with these two phones at home, in the office, around town and at the beach. I took scores of photos and videos, watched tons of YouTube and Netflix movies, chatted my fingers off. I sat on them in my back pocket (no Bendgate yet). I've unlocked these things 100 times in four different ways (fingerprint, eyes, face, PIN). So I'm confident pointing out the S8's problems -- because, let's be real, there's always something .. Samsung Galaxy S8, S8 Plus and Bixby pix: Come and get 'em. In this case, I can boil it down to the awkwardly placed fingerprint reader -- you will curse this -- and the still-up-in-the-air Bixby AI software , which combines Siri , Google Now and a camera add-on. (Samsung's Siri-like Bixby Voice tool is live in South Korea , but nowhere else and I use the rest of the Bixby features... never.) Also, while photo quality is great, it's weird to me that Samsung, usually so on top of trends, opted for one camera lens on the back instead of two.. So far, the battery has made the S8 warm, like most phones get, but not dangerously hot. Hopefully Samsung's new eight-point battery test has done its job keeping all future handsets combustion-free, unlike the poor Note 7. The battery reserves have lasted a good, long time (but I'm keeping an eye on idle drain as the months march on). Overall, it's zippier than the Galaxy S7 , but not so much better at its core that S7 owners should dash to upgrade.. What you really need to know is that the S8 is an extremely fast, highly competent, visually stunning device that you'll probably want to use with a case. Yes, this will hide most of its beautiful lines. Tough luck: It's just too costly and pretty to risk dropping.. And the Galaxy S8 is expensive. At $750, £689 or AU$1,199, you want to know that your phone is going to go the distance, and that you won't regret getting something cheaper -- like the midrange but awesome-for-what-it-is OnePlus 3T (which is being phased out in preparation of the OnePlus 5, so hurry if you want one) -- or holding out for the next iPhone , Google Pixel or Note 8 , each of which should debut in the next four to six months.. So long as you aren't hanging all your hopes on work-in-progress Bixby (Google Assistant is an easy alternative to invoke) and have the patience of a saint when unlocking the phone, the Galaxy S8 is a sound buy that will make your friends jealous of its tall, curved, crazy-elegant screen. If you're serious about buying, I'd make a special trip to test out the fingerprint reader before taking the plunge. And if your current phone isn't yet on its last legs, it doesn't hurt to wait and see how the S8's battery continues to fare in the wild. So far, though, it appears to be incident-free.. Editors' note: This review originally published April 18, 2017, and was updated May 26 at 11 a.m. If you already have a Galaxy S8, here are our best tips and tricks .. Not to be dramatic, but the Galaxy S8 really is a feast for the eyes. It adopts a new dimension -- 18.5:9 (that's almost 2:1 like the LG G6 ( $569.95 at Amazon.com ) ) -- which means that it's tall and narrow. That makes it easier to use one-handed. Extremely slim bezels mean there's much more screen stuffed into the shape: 83 percent of the phone's face is all yours for tapping and viewing. The S8 is almost the exact same height as the G6, but those curved sides make the S8 feel narrower, slimmer and, in truth, much more vulnerable.. Don't want this to happen? Get a case.. I was extremely nervous I'd drop it. It almost seems more like a museum piece than a tool I'm going to use every day. I've had a couple close calls so far, but it hasn't smashed to the ground yet. When it inevitably does, because butterfingers, I have a feeling those rounded edges will be easier to crack than a device with straight sides. I can't say for sure, but the bigger problem may be the glass back.. Last year's GS7 shattered when I dropped it (oops) , and my colleague Luke Lancaster in Sydney said his S8 slipped and slid out from under him, resulting in a bash. With the Galaxy S8's newer Gorilla Glass 5 topper, time will tell just how often this happens for others, too.. See what happened when we purposely tried to smash it up .. There's no more physical home button, and honestly? I didn't miss it at all. The onscreen control you see on pretty much every other Android phone felt completely natural. In fact, going Home on the S8 was faster than going Home on a lightly used S7. By the way, you can swap the placement of the Back and Recents buttons if you want to.. The S8 is the first standard Galaxy S phone (as in, not an Edge or Edge Plus) to have curved sides and the Edge display. You can use it as a kind of speed dial for your frequent apps and contacts, news headlines and so on, which you can call up from any screen (and tweak the tab location so it's easy for you to grab). You can add a lot of panes in the settings, but I like it best when kept to two -- otherwise you waste time trying to find what you're looking for.. Best Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus cases. Oh, one more thing about the screen. It's a very high-resolution, 2,960x1,440-pixel display, and that makes text, images and video absolutely pop, even in direct sunlight. You should know, though, that the off-standard dimension means you'll have to either be cool with black bars on the sides of videos you play (called pillarboxing), or you'll need to tap a screen control to crop-to-fit. In some videos, doing so reduced image quality. At other times, it looked just as good.. That fingerprint reader is mighty close to the camera.. My biggest problem with the phone design is the fingerprint reader, which moved from the home button on the S7's front face to a narrow strip on its backing that looks a lot like a Tic Tac, just left of the camera mount. I have no idea what Samsung was thinking putting it here. Other rear-mounted fingerprint sensors, such as the LG G6 and Google Pixel, are closer to the middle center of the phone's body, well clear of the camera and flash. They're round and easier to completely cover with your fingertip.. Muscle memory has somewhat taken over and I've grown more used to the placement. I got a lot of setup errors, and the accuracy is still less "hit" and more "miss," especially when I haven't unlocked the phone for a stretch. And yes, I did often smear the camera with finger grease (yum) on the way to the scanner.. (Interlude: My colleague Patrick Holland tested the effect of fingerprint smudges on a bunch of phones, and noticed that the S8 still takes great pics regardless. We'll see if this holds up over time, or if the protective exterior coating wears out and image quality begins to suffer.). Wait, you say! You can always use face unlock (which Samsung calls more convenient than it is secure, so no thanks) or the iris scanner, which is deemed secure enough for Samsung Pay. The iris scanner takes longer than an accurate fingerprint reader on a rival phone, plus you have to hold it level to your face, and lift your sunglasses if you're outside. It doesn't always work in every lighting situation. But it worked fine with my glasses, even though I registered my peepers with contacts.. Best combination: Fingerprint reader with the iris scanner as backup, plus a PIN or pattern for times when the other two take too long.. One other thing about the fingerprint reader and Samsung Pay. Using both the fingerprint and iris methods to authenticate a payment took longer than on the Galaxy S7 and Note 7 (where the reader's on the home button), which made me feel like a jerk for holding up the line. Having a credit card ready is frankly faster, even though it's way less cool.. Bixby is the blanket name for a feature that's actually broken into three parts: Voice, Home and Vision. It does not replace Google voice search or Google Assistant, which comes preloaded on the S8 and which you can invoke by long-pressing the home button.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a gorgeous big-screen phone with a comfortable single-handed feel, and it's packed with top-notch components and promising new software.. Samsung sets the pace for smartphone power in 2017 with the Galaxy S8 ($750 as tested). It's the best phone at nearly everything it does, whether it's connecting to the internet, making calls, playing games, taking photos, or watching big-screen video. The S8 isn't leaps and bounds ahead of other top choices like the Google Pixel, but it's the overall most capable phone on the market, and our Editors' Choice.. This is a review of the smaller Galaxy S8. There is also a larger Galaxy S8+ model, with a 6.2-inch screen and a larger battery.. The Galaxy S8 is available from every major carrier in the US and several prepaid carriers. While it's only available from carriers right now, an unlocked version will follow in May or June.. Prices in the US vary from $659 on Walmart's Total Wireless, to $750 at AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile (I tested the phone on Sprint and T-Mobile). You may also be able to get a promotional deal at big-box retailers like Best Buy or Target. We have a full rundown of the different prices and deals for the S8, and MobileSyrup has a good overview of Canadian prices .. View All 12 Photos in Gallery. It's also worth mentioning that this is a review of the US and Canadian unit of the phone. Other countries have a different device with a different Samsung Exynos processor that may function differently.. "The core idea behind the Galaxy S8...has been to deliver the biggest screen in the smallest device possible," Robert Kim, vice president of Samsung's global product strategy team, told me at Samsung's headquarters in Korea. "The contradiction is that [customers] want to have a bigger screen size but a small form factor," Kim added. By shrinking bezels and bending edges, Samsung makes that happen.. The Galaxy S8 is proportionately tall and narrow. It's also very slippery, so you'll want a case. It measures 5.86 by 2.68 by 0.31 inches and weighs 5.47 ounces. That's taller than the Galaxy S7 (5.61 by 2.74 by 0.31 inches), but narrower — and remember, the S7 only has a 5.1-inch screen to the S8's 5.8-inch panel.. The idea is you're going to use it in one hand. It's easy to wrap your fingers around the S8, even if you have relatively small hands. But you're still going to be shifting it up and down in your hand more often than you would with the S7 or the iPhone 7 , to reach all of the vertical stretch of the screen.. Almost all of the front face is the 5.8-inch, 2,960-by-1,440 Super AMOLED display, which Ray Soneira at DisplayMate has said in a comprehensive report is the best one on the market. It's bright and glowy, with saturated colors and great blacks.. It's also a little smaller than Samsung says it is, because of the new 18.5:9 aspect ratio. Most phones are 16:9, so the S8 is taller and narrower than they are. It's even narrower, proportionately, than the LG G6, which is 2:1. The S8's screen is 13.23 square inches — I call that SQUID , or square inches of display.. On a standard 16:9 aspect ratio phone, you get the same real estate in a 5.6-inch screen. So I think you should consider the S8's screen on par with the 5.5-inch, 16:9 displays on the Galaxy S7 Edge and iPhone 7 Plus .. Above the screen, a notification LED blinks if you have unread notifications or a low battery. There's a new button on the left side. It's there to activate Bixby, Samsung's voice assistant. On the bottom there's a single speaker, along with a USB-C port and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The speaker sounds richer and less tinny than the S7's does. It's also about 1dB louder at its maximum volume.. The phone comes in three colors: black, gray, and silver. I received black review units, and they get very smeary on the back. It's especially an issue because the fingerprint sensor is on the back right next to the camera lens, and while there's a slight ridge between them, it's almost unnoticeable. That means you will definitely smear the camera lens when you go to use the fingerprint scanner.. The phone is waterproof, which will be a relief to many. But the all-glass body seems a bit fragile. Samsung said that by using Gorilla Glass 5 with a more gentle curve than on the Galaxy S7 Edge, it's made the phone more durable. At its manufacturing plant in Gumi, Korea, it showed me a four-foot drop test. Still, though, that glass back will be inherently more breakable than a metal back, and Samsung's curved glass is expensive to replace.. "Compared to the S7, component wise, [durability] is a 40 percent improvement," Kim said. The Galaxy S8 has no physical home button. Instead, you press on the screen where you see a home button icon, and you feel a little bit of haptic feedback. The app drawer icon is gone, too —t o get the app drawer, you swipe up from the home area. It takes a little getting used to.. The aspect ratio definitely creates issues with third-party apps. YouTube videos, for instance, either have black bars on the sides, or get zoomed and cropped into full-screen mode. Samsung Mobile CEO DJ Koh said Facebook has already updated for the new size, and, "All of our major partners are working on it.". On a settings screen called Full Screen Apps, I found that many text-oriented information and social networking apps, such as Microsoft Office, TripAdvisor, and Marvel Unlimited, are optimized for the tall screen, while most games are not. Everything runs, it just might not use the whole display. Launching an un-optimized game such as Mini Metro displays the game with black bars on either side of the screen.. 21:9 wide-screen movies look great, with less letterboxing than on the Galaxy S7. 16:9 TV shows, on the other hand, have visible pillarboxing. Launching a 16:9 video in YouTube gives you the option to pillarbox the video, or to zoom and crop into full-screen mode, but that forces part of the image off of the screen. This is similar to the experience on the LG G6 .. Yes, the Galaxy S8 makes phone calls. It has whatever your carrier's latest phone-calling techniques are (like HD Voice, VoLTE, and Wi-Fi calling) and calls sound clear, with aggressive noise cancellation in the microphone. I was especially impressed with the speakerphone volume when the Extra Volume button is pressed — the voice blasting out of the bottom-ported speaker is easily hearable outdoors.. The rest of the networking alphabet soup is supported as well. There's dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, which I found worked about as well with our Netgear router as the Galaxy S7 does (which is to say, very well). The phone has NFC and MST, so you can do mobile payments even with old school magnetic credit card readers that don't support tap-to-pay. ANT+ is on board for certain smart home devices .. This is the first phone with Bluetooth 5, which can potentially transmit to devices 120 feet away, as well as to two sets of headphones at once. However, there are no other Bluetooth 5 devices out there to test the S8 against yet.. The phone comes in one size, 64GB with 4GB RAM, and there's also a microSD card slot tucked in with the SIM slot, which can handle 256GB cards. Samsung still doesn't support Google's Adoptable Storage mode, so the card will appear as a separate storage device. But you can move apps to the SD card from one of the settings pages. About 10.7GB of the phone's storage is taken up by the system and non-deletable apps.. Battery life is far better in real-world practice than it is in our benchmarks. With the same size battery as the S7 (3,000mAh) driving a larger, brighter screen, I got considerably shorter time on our screen-blasting LTE video streaming test: 5 hours, 45 minutes on the S8 compared with the S7's nearly 9 hours. That made me uncomfortable, so I tried some other scenarios. Dropping the screen resolution to 1080p got 7 hours, 39 minutes. Dropping to half brightness got twelve and a half hours.. In real-life use over several days, with the screen generally at around half brightness, the S8 had no problem lasting through the day each time. In general, I ended up with about 30 percent battery after a 12-hour day before starting to charge again, with the shortest run-out time at about 16 hours and the longest well over 24 hours.. The Google Pixel has a 1080p screen, and if you set the S8's screen to the same resolution, you get about the same usage time. But the Pixel is better at not draining battery in standby. The iPhone 7 has shorter screen-on usage time, but it's more efficient in standby and playing audio.. The good news is that the S8's quick charging feature is very quick. The phone charges from zero to 100 percent in about an hour and a half. I got to 15 percent charge in 15 minutes, and 30 percent in half an hour.. Samsung Mobile R&D VP Bookeun Oh told me, "I focused on maintaining the durability of the battery over the long term, over hundreds of charging cycles. For example, after approximately six months of normal usage, the battery in the S8 will outperform previous batteries. While most batteries hold about 80 percent of their charge after two years in usual cases, this battery should be capable of 95 percent of its original capacity.". I'm also confident this phone won't explode. I took a trip to the factory where AT&T and Verizon units are made, saw Samsung's array of new tests, and spoke to the company's battery advisory council. Samsung is taking battery safety seriously in a way that it didn't with the Galaxy Note 7 , and these phones are very extensively tested. Using a smaller battery than it could have, I'm sorry to say, is also part of the new focus on safety.. The S8 is the first US phone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset. Qualcomm has been making a big deal about calling its chipsets platforms rather than processors, and some of that is because most of its improvements are in areas like DSPs, graphics, and modem capabilities, and not the individual CPU cores.. You see this in the benchmarks. First of all, benchmark results change depending on what you have the screen resolution set to. Looking purely at the CPU, the single-core Geekbench score of 1,836 isn't any better than the Snapdragon 821-powered LG G6, at 1,811. The multi-core score of 5,960 outpaces the G6 (4,195), but only matches the Huawei Mate 9 and Huawei P10 .. But the 835 pumps a lot more graphics horsepower than those competitors do. On the most advanced GFXBenchmark Car Crash test, the Galaxy S8 pushed 12fps onscreen and 22fps offscreen at WQHD resolution. That's around double the G6 or P10's performance. Down at 1080p resolution, it scaled to 43fps onscreen, double the Google Pixel's result.. Left to right: Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S7. Using the Snapdragon 835-optimized Samsung web browser gives the S8 superior JavaScript and web performance, too. It scored 71 on the JetStream Javascript benchmark, to the LG G6's 54 and the Google Pixel's 55. On the Browsermark web test, the Pixel scored 118 while the S8 made it to 145. That means snappier web page performance overall.. Between this and the modem advances (described below), the benchmarks bear out Qualcomm's contention that device performance is more than just individual processor cores. Of course, that cuts both ways. While our test S8s were fast and smooth, Samsung devices have a reputation for lagging badly after a year or so (that's certainly happening with my S7). Because that lag is frequently solved by a factory reset, it's clear that the problem is in software, not hardware.. Samsung has sworn up and down that the S8 won't have the creeping lag issues that previous models did. Of course, it's sworn the same thing before. There's no way to tell during the first week of use, alas.. Smartphones aren't much use if they don't connect. The S8's invisible, secret weapon is that it's the first US phone with gigabit LTE and HPUE , combinations of four technologies that can improve performance on all four networks. I tested the phones on Sprint and T-Mobile, and found distinct improvements over the Galaxy S7.. Samsung says all the carrier versions of the phone are identical, frequency band-wise. Galaxy S8 phones will work on all the U.S. and Canadian carriers, as well as roaming globally. However, foreign phones may have some foreign LTE bands which are not common in the U.S.. On Sprint, the S8 is the second phone (after the LG G6) with HPUE, which improves connectivity in weak signal conditions, especially with upload speeds. Over 34 tests in extremely weak signal conditions, only eight failed on the S8 while 24 failed on the S7. In 48 tests of slightly better but still bad conditions, I got 2.33Mbps uploads on the S8 and only 1.3Mbps on the S7 (downloads were pretty much the same between them).. As signal quality gets better, the S8's advantage fades. With decent signal, the S8 got 9.83Mbps down and 4.69Mbps up, while the S7 showed 7.41Mbps down and 4.79Mbps up. In our strongest signal test, both phones had no trouble hitting 120Mbps speeds right by a Sprint cell site. HPUE doesn't raise the roof — it raises the floor.. The outcome for Sprint users: If you are frustrated with Sprint connectivity in a place where Sprint is supposed to have LTE, getting a Galaxy S8 will go a long way toward curing your dead-zone problem.. The S8's advantage on T-Mobile is different. It combines several different technologies to potentially double download speeds. In T-Mobile's case, the difference should get more dramatic as speeds get better and faster, the opposite of the Sprint situation.. I only ran ten tests on T-Mobile because of data limits, but I still saw the difference: 15.36Mbps down and 11Mbps up on the S8 compared with 8.65Mbps down and 10Mbps up on the S7. In congested areas, the S8 is the third phone (after the LG V20 and G6) to use its new Band 66 LTE network, which should prevent speeds from crashing too low.. The phone should improve performance on AT&T and Verizon, as well. AT&T has called the S8 its first " 5G Evolution " phone, which means it has the same three technologies that T-Mobile terms "gigabit LTE." AT&T's rollout is going a little more slowly than T-Mobile's, with Austin and Indianapolis getting the network first.. Verizon has stayed irritatingly coy about its plans for gigabit technologies, but the same three elements should work on its network, too. In late 2016, Verizon said it had 3x carrier aggregation and 256 QAM, and it said it was deploying 4x4 MIMO more than a year ago. Verizon wouldn't confirm whether 4x4 MIMO is activated on its version of the phone, though.. The S8 is also the first phone with LTE-U , a new form of LTE that uses Wi-Fi airwaves to enhance capacity in crowded areas. I haven't seen much in the way of LTE-U buildouts yet, but AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon are all working on it.. Samsung does not leave Android alone. You have to be OK with that to enjoy Samsung phones. The Galaxy S8 runs Android 7.0 Nougat , but with Samsung's icons, home screen, and apps added to Google's. And not just Samsung's: Our Sprint unit came with six Amazon apps, six "featured" apps, and eight Sprint apps for a total of twenty chunks of carrier bloatware. Samsung is also keeping its custom camera, gallery, music, and phone apps, although the music app is a downloadable option. The phone app now integrates a sticker and GIF messaging function that's tied to your Samsung Account, which will be able to be used if your friends also have Samsung accounts.. The "always-on" front display has a more visually appealing design than on the S7, with a colorful spray of stars across the screen. Like on the S7, it shows the time and date or a calendar, as well as notification icons. Double-tapping on a notification icon shows you more information, or takes you to the app which was sending the notification.. The really tall screen allows for a neat multitasking trick: You can select a chunk of an app's screen and pin it to the top, running other apps in the bottom half. That lets you watch a video while sending texts about it, for instance.. You can swap the order of the back and multitasking buttons in the software. Press down on a home screen icon, and you get Google's Quick Option menu, letting you clear notification badges and uninstall the app.. Samsung's edge functionality is better than ever. You swipe in from the right-hand side of the screen to see app shortcuts and your favorite contacts by default, and there are more than two dozen other Edge Panels you can download. There's a calendar, a calculator, a note-taking app, messengers, and system status widgets. Also useful, but perpetually hidden in stacks of settings screens, are all of Samsung's custom settings options. Want to change the screen color gamut? The order of the virtual buttons at the bottom? Want to change what's shown on the always-on display? Samsung's phones have always been highly customizable, unless you're talking about getting rid of the Samsung stuff entirely.. Since Samsung seems to realize that putting its fingerprint scanner spot right next to the camera isn't the best idea, it offers up a buffet of other ways to authenticate yourself. The two more exotic ones are face and iris recognition.. Face recognition is quick and easy. In our tests, it worked flawlessly and nearly instantly. But it also isn't secure , Samsung warns. I couldn't get it to unlock using a picture of my face, but others have been able to do so. That means it'll defeat casual attempts to unlock it, but not a determined antagonist who knows who you are.. Samsung advises that users take off their glasses to unlock their phones, which I'm happy to say isn't necessary. But iris recognition only worked eight out of 10 times for me, it's slower than other methods, and I was often bombarded by prompts to move the phone higher and farther away.. Complicating things, you can use your iris or fingerprint for Samsung Pay, but not your face.. I started out not using the fingerprint scanner, but after a few days, I was using it regularly. The change happened when I put the S8 in a Caseology Legion case, which has a slanted cutout for the fingerprint scanner and camera. The case cutout gave me the tactile cues I needed to hit the fingerprint scanner without smudging the camera.. Samsung's flagship new service, Bixby, can't be tested yet. It won't be launched until May. The idea behind Bixby is that you push a dedicated button on the side of the phone and you're able to command it by voice, for instance, to send a photo you just took to someone in your contact list.. According to Samsung Mobile CTO Injong Rhee, Bixby will initially work with ten built-in apps, including camera, contacts, gallery, phone, reminders, and settings, but notably not the browser, calendar, or email. Rhee said those will come in the second batch of 10, and the company has 32 apps targeted.. "Right now, our focus is on the device interface and application controls," Rhee said. "As Bixby's ecosystem expands, clearly there's an overlap between what Bixby can pursue and what Google Assistant can pursue. We are working with Google...so we can actually benefit from both." For the record, "OK Google" works just fine on this phone.. Pressing the Bixby button right now takes you to "Hello Bixby," Samsung's answer to Google Now's stack of personalized cards. By default, it shows your most recently taken photos, reminders, weather, and a news feed, although with time it's supposed to prompt you with apps and information it thinks you might want — pushing Uber at you if you take an Uber at the same time each day, for instance.. Other much-heralded new software remains similarly elusive. Samsung Connect is supposed to bring together all of your (new) Samsung appliances and SmartThings Hub functionality. It doesn't work yet, so I can't judge it. Samsung's Dex, a system to turn your phone into a desktop PC, also isn't ready yet. See our in-depth look at DeX for more details.. The Galaxy S8 has a 12-megapixel camera, just like the S7. I took side-by-side images with the S7 and S8 in a variety of modes, and the S8's pictures are clearer and brighter, with more detail and less artifacting. While the S8 doesn't have dual main cameras, there's a software-based Selective Focus mode to create bokeh, and a pretty good Pro mode that includes Raw capture and manual shutter speed.. Low-light performance has taken a step up, too. Compared with the S7, shots taken in very low light show noticeably more detail on the S8. The S8 outpaces the Pixel in low light, too, with sharper detail, less artifacting, and slightly better colors. I'm comfortable saying that the S8 has the best phone camera I've seen, although I'm also going to turn the phone over to our camera analyst for a longer look.. The front-facing camera has improved from 5MP to 8MP, and it's gotten autofocus. In practice, that means sharper focus on faces, with backgrounds going slightly out of focus. That makes photos of yourself look great, but it means that if you're used to taking photos of yourself in front of things — famous buildings, for instance — you'll have to make sure to lock focus on the distant object to get the same fixed-focus look you're used to.. As light gets lower, the front-facing camera gets a bit soft, but it keeps skin tones warm. I prefer this approach to what the Pixel does, which makes my face look pale and dirty as it tries to dramatically brighten my features. Actual exposure isn't necessarily better than the S7, but you have more pixels, so things don't look quite as soft.. Both cameras record video as well, of course, to true 4K with the main camera, and 2,560-by-1,440 with the front camera, both at 30fps in all circumstances. There's also a 60fps 1080p (barely) slow-mo option. The main camera has OIS and the front camera doesn't, but in general, they're both excellent video cameras, much as the S7's was as well.. One new gimmick, Bixby Vision, isn't a great differentiator. It's a mode in the camera that can shop for products or translate text based on a picture you take. But it's no better than Google Translate or Microsoft Word Lens (in fact, the translator just uses Google Translate). It's not a minus, it's just not much of a plus.. That's also what they do: connect us, to each other and to the internet. We create things, whether they're words or pictures, and we share them. The Galaxy S8 is the best phone available for creating things you want to share, sharing them, and experiencing things shared by others. It's the most connected device possible.. That said, the Google Pixel is less expensive than most S8 carrier models at $649. While the S8 is slightly better in many ways, the Pixel has a cleaner interface, more frequent Android updates, and longer standby battery life. For AT&T and Verizon users, meanwhile, the unlocked ZTE Axon 7 and OnePlus 3T deliver all of the power most people want for around $400.. The S8 securely kills the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in our eyes, though. While the iPhone SE is still an excellent value, platform lock-in is pretty much the only reason to get an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus over this device—the idea that you've spent so much time and money learning Apple's apps and using iMessage that it would be too much of a bear to leave.. But the phone is expensive enough that I would hesitate to upgrade from an S7, unless you think the better modem will help you connect where you couldn't before. The S8 is better than the S7 in every way except battery life, but it's a lot of money for incremental improvements.. I prefer the S8 to its larger sibling the S8+, though. This is purely a taste issue, as I love how the S8 is comfortable in one hand, even with a case on. The S8+ adds a bit more battery life and a bigger screen for $100 more, but doesn't add any other functionality, and I don't think the trade-off for usability is quite worth it. People with large hands, of course, may disagree.. The Galaxy S8 is the most luxurious, best performing phone on the market right now. It's on fire, and I don't mean that literally. Maybe it's more phone than most people need. But it's almost certainly better than the phone you have. And for that reason it's our Editors' Choice.. Bottom Line: The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a gorgeous big-screen phone with a comfortable single-handed feel, and it's packed with top-notch components and promising new software..

Snapdragon: Adreno 540. 2960×1440 1440p Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen display,. ppcm (572 ppi ). The Samsung Galaxy S8 , Samsung Galaxy S8+ (shortened to S8 and S8+ , respectively) and Samsung Galaxy S8 Active are Android smartphones produced by Samsung Electronics as part of the Samsung Galaxy S series. The S8 and S8+ were unveiled on 29 March 2017 and directly succeed the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, with a North American release on 21 April 2017 and international rollout throughout April and May. The S8 Active was announced on 8 August 2017, and is exclusive to certain U.S. The S8 and S8+ contain upgraded hardware and major design changes over the S7 line, including larger screens with a taller aspect ratio and curved sides on both the smaller and larger models, iris and face recognition , a new suite of virtual assistant features known as Bixby (along with a new dedicated physical button for launching the assistant), and Samsung DeX , a docking station accessory that allows the phones to be used with a desktop interface with keyboard and mouse input support. The S8 Active features tougher materials designed for protection against shock, shatter, water and dust, with a metal frame and a rugged, tough texture for improved grip. The Active's screen measures the same size as the standard S8 model, but loses the curved edges in favor of a metal frame.. The S8 and S8+ received mostly positive reviews. Their design and form factor received praise, while critics also liked the updated software and camera optimizations. They received criticism for duplicate software apps, lackluster Bixby features at launch, for the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the rear next to the camera and for poor biometric options for unlocking the phone. Videos published after the phones' release have proven that the devices' facial and iris scanners can be fooled by suitable photographs of the user.. The S8 and S8+ were in high demand at release. During the pre-order period, a record one million units were booked in South Korea, and overall sales numbers were 30% higher than the Galaxy S7. However, subsequent reports in May announced sales of over five million units, a notably lower first-month sales number than previous Galaxy S series models.. 5.3 Insecure facial recognition. 5.4 Insecure iris recognition. 5.5 SMS message reception failures. Prior to its official announcement, media outlets reported on rumors and information from industry insiders. In December 2016, SamMobile reported that the Galaxy S8 would not feature a 3.5. mm headphone jack , [9] later reported to be a false rumor. [10] In January 2017, The Guardian reported on bigger screens for both of the two phone sizes, with edge-to-edge "infinity" displays and very limited bezels, and an iris scanner. [11] Additionally, The Guardian stated that the phones would come with 64. gigabytes of storage and support microSD cards, use USB-C connectors, and feature a "Bixby" intelligent personal assistant. [11] [12] [13] Soon after, VentureBeat revealed photos of the phones and additional details, including the lack of physical navigation and home buttons, in which the fingerprint sensor was moved to the back of the phone. [14] [15] [16] Evan Blass tweeted in mid-March about color options for the phones. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ were officially unveiled on 29 March 2017, with pre-orders beginning 30 March and official U.S. [19] [20] Following Best Buy retail listings in March, [21] Samsung opened pre-orders for unlocked U.S. handsets on 9 May 2017, with availability starting 31 May. The devices have also been released internationally. On 21 April 2017, they were made available in South Korea, [24] Canada, [25] and Taiwan. [26] On 28 April, they were made available in the United Kingdom, [27] Australia, [28] Ireland, [29] and Russia. [30] followed by Singapore one day later. [31] On 5 May, they were made available in Malaysia. [32] New Zealand, [33] India, [34] the Philippines, [35] and Thailand. [36] followed by Brazil on 12 May. [37] On 25 May, they were made available in China, [38] and Hong Kong. [39] On 8 June, they were made available in Japan. In July 2017, pictures of the Galaxy S8 Active were leaked on Reddit , [41] [42] and the following month, AT&T "accidentally" confirmed its existence through a document in a promotional campaign. [43] [44] It officially became available for pre-order, exclusively through AT&T, on 8 August 2017, with in-store purchase available 11 August. [45] VentureBeat reported in late September that the device would also become available through T-Mobile in November, [46] and Samsung subsequently confirmed both T-Mobile and Sprint availability in early November. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ both feature 1440p OLED displays, with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio taller than the 16:9 ratio used by the majority of smartphones; the S8 has a 5.8-inch panel, while the S8+ uses a larger 6.2-inch panel. The displays on both devices curve along the side bezels of the device, with minimal bezels that Samsung markets as an "Infinity Display", and the display panel itself has rounded edges. [19] They use DCI-P3 , offering what screen-testing website DisplayMate describes as the largest native color gamut , highest peak brightness, highest contrast rating in ambient light, highest screen resolution, lowest reflectance, and highest contrast ratio. [48] [49] The S8 features an octa-core Exynos 8895 system-on-chip and 4. GB of RAM; models in North American markets utilize the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 instead. Both chips are manufactured by Samsung with a 10 nm process. [19] [50] They contain 64. GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD card. [19] The Galaxy S8 is one of the first smartphones to support Bluetooth 5 , supporting new capabilities such as connecting two wireless headphones to the device at once. [51] It is also bundled with Harman AKG earbuds. [52] [53] Both smartphones have improved satellite navigation over the predecessors by including Galileo receivers. [4] In the United States, the S8 and S8+ are available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, and Arctic Silver color options, whereas gold and blue are available internationally. [19] The blue option was made available in the U.S. Unlike past Galaxy S series models, the S8 line does not feature physical navigation keys, electing to use on-screen keys instead. [19] However, unlike other implementations, the home button can still be activated if it is hidden or the screen is off. The S8's display features pressure sensitivity limited to the home button. [56] To prevent the home button from burn-in damage, its position moves slightly. [57] [58] While The Verge claims that the S8 uses exactly the same 12-megapixel rear camera as the S7, though with software improvements, [19] a report from PhoneArena claims that the phones carry new, custom camera modules. [59] The front-facing camera was upgraded to an 8-megapixel sensor with autofocus. [19] [60] The S8 features fingerprint and iris scanners; the fingerprint reader is relocated to the rear of the device, to the left of the camera, due to the removal of the physical home button. [19] In addition to an iris scanner, the S8 also features face-scanning as an option to unlock the phone. [61] [62] Face recognition technology had previously been implemented in earlier models since the Galaxy S III. The S8 and S8+ use non-removable 3000 and 3500. mAh batteries respectively; Samsung stated that it had engineered the batteries to retain their capacity for a longer period of time than previous models. [60] The S8 supports AirFuel Inductive (formerly PMA) [64] and Qi wireless charging standards. [19] Due to the recalls of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 , Samsung said in a press conference it is committed to stricter quality control and safety testing procedures on all of the company's future products. Samsung also launched a Galaxy S8+ with 128. GB of RAM exclusively in China and South Korea, and a bundle offer in the countries provides both the exclusive model and the Samsung DeX docking station. [66] [67] The unique variant was also released in India in June 2017. The Galaxy S8 Active features a rugged design and significantly tougher materials to make it "shock, shatter, water, and dust resistant". It has a larger battery than either of the regular S8s, at 4000. The "infinity" edge display of the standard models is removed, replaced with a metal frame and bumpers in the corners to protect from shocks, while the back is fitted with a "rugged, tough texture for a secure grip". Its screen also measures 5.8 inches, the size of the regular S8, and has quad HD Super AMOLED in 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The S8 Active is sold in Meteor Gray, but AT&T also has a Titanium Gold color. The Galaxy S8 launched with the Android 7.0 "Nougat" operating system with the proprietary Samsung Experience (formerly TouchWiz ) user interface and software suite. [60] The software features a suite of assistant functions known as "Bixby" , which is designed primarily to interact with Samsung's bundled applications and other supported services. The feature allows the use of voice commands to perform phone functions, can generate cards shown on a home screen page (replacing the Flipboard integration formerly featured) based on a user's interactions, and perform searches utilizing object recognition via the camera. Bixby will support third-party integration via an SDK. [60] The S8 supports the use of a docking station known as Samsung DeX to access a PC-like desktop environment on an external display, with support for mouse and keyboard input. [69] On 21 April 2017, coinciding with the phone's official retail date, reports surfaced that the default music player on the Galaxy S8 would be Google Play Music , continuing a trend that started with the S7 in 2016. However, for the S8, Samsung partnered with Google to incorporate additional exclusive features into the app, including the ability to upload up to 100,000 tracks to the service's cloud storage, an increase from the 50,000 tracks users are normally allowed to upload. Additionally, new users get a three-month free trial to the service, the same as given to users who purchase Google's own Pixel smartphone. Furthermore, Google stated that more Samsung-exclusive features will be added to the app in the future, and that the Bixby assistant will also be supported by the app. [70] [71] Bixby replaces S Voice , the voice recognition technology previously found in Samsung Galaxy models. In May 2017, Google announced that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will support the company's Daydream virtual reality platform after Samsung rolls out a software update scheduled for mid-2017. [73] [74] In July 2017, Verizon began rolling out an update for its devices, with support for Daydream. [75] [76] The Galaxy S8 was one of the first Android phones to support ARCore , Google's augmented reality engine. In February 2018, the official Android 8.0 Oreo update began rolling out to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy S8+. The S8 Active, released in August 2017, is a more rugged version of the S8. Besides the phones protective case reportedly cracking and peeling away in under 2 months of use, Dan Seifert of The Verge praised the design of the Galaxy S8, describing it as a "stunning device to look at and hold" that was "refined and polished to a literal shine", and adding that it "truly doesn't look like any other phone you might have used before". The hardware of the device was described as "practically flawless". Seifert also liked the new software, writing that "Samsung is known less for polish and more for clumsiness. In a refreshing change of pace, the software on the S8 is, dare I say, good [ sic ]". However, he criticized the Bixby assistant, writing that "in its current state, it doesn’t do much at all", and also criticized the amount of duplicate apps. Regarding performance, he wrote that the S8 was "fast and responsive, but so is virtually every other premium phone you can buy, and the S8 isn’t noticeably faster or quicker than a Google Pixel , LG G6 , or iPhone 7 ". [80] Fellow Verge reporter Vlad Savov felt that the placement of the fingerprint sensor was "a perplexing decision if we consider it as a deliberate design choice", but noted reports from Korea claiming that Samsung had originally intended for the fingerprint reader to be built directly into the screen, but was unable to reach a desirable implementation in time for release. [81] The Verge wrote that "Samsung’s six-month-old S8 has cutting edge features and design with fewer issues than other Android phones" like the Google Pixel 2 and LG V30 , and that the "OLED screen stretches to the edges of the device and curves on its sides in an almost liquid fashion. It makes the S8 look just as fresh today as it did when it debuted", and pointing out that the S8's popularity and carrier support guaranteed plenty of third-party accessories. Chris Velazco of Engadget similarly praised the design, stating that "from their rounded edges to their precisely formed metal-and-glass bodies, they feel like smaller, sleeker versions of the Galaxy Note 7", and also praised the display as being simply "awesome". Velazco also praised the software, calling Samsung's added interface "subtle and thoughtful in its design choices". While noting that the Bixby assistant wasn't ready yet, he did compliment the promised voice features as being more granular than those offered through Siri or Google Assistant , and wrote that "With that kind of complexity involved, maybe it's no surprise this stuff isn't done yet". Also praising performance and the camera, though noting that "The 12-megapixel sensors on the back haven't changed much since last year. That's not a bad thing since they were great cameras to start with", Velazco summarized his review by writing that the devices "aren't perfect, but they're as close as Samsung has ever gotten". [83] Brandon Russell of TechnoBuffalo claimed that the camera could not beat Google's Pixel smartphone. Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica noted that the device's unusual aspect ratio resulted in pillarboxing when watching 16:9 video without zooming or stretching it. He complimented the feel of the S8, calling it "perfected", but criticized the glass back for being "more fragile" and that "Glossy, slippery glass doesn't feel as good in your hand as metal does, either. For the top-tier premium price tag, we'd prefer Samsung to put in the extra work and use a metal back". He criticized the biometric options for unlocking the phones, writing that "There's an iris scanner, a fingerprint reader, and face unlock. The problem is none of them are any good", and also criticized duplicate apps, writing that "most of which can't be removed and aren't very compelling". Additionally, he criticized Bixby, calling it "an odd addition" due to the phone's Google Assistant functionality already present. Prior to the phone's official announcement, reports suggested that Bixby would support "7-8 languages" at launch. [86] Later reports after the phone's announcement clarified that Bixby would only support Korean and American English languages at its release, though noting that more languages would be coming "in the following months". [87] [88] In mid-April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Bixby would be launched without support for American English. [89] [90] On 19 July 2017, Samsung announced that Bixby had begun rolling out to Galaxy S8 users in the United States. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ broke pre-order records in South Korea, with more than 720,000 units booked in one week, a notable increase from the 100,000 units of the Galaxy S7 and 200,000 units of the Note 7. [93] [94] By mid-April, the number had increased to one million pre-orders. [95] [96] On 24 April 2017, Samsung announced that sales of the Galaxy S8 was its "best ever". Although it did not release specific sales numbers, it announced that sales of the S8 were 30% higher year-over-year than the Galaxy S7. [97] [98] Subsequent reports in May announced that Samsung had sold over five million units. [99] [100] Jon Fingas of Engadget wrote that, although Samsung advertised its pre-order records, sales comparisons to other models on the market were difficult due to unannounced sales figures. [101] However, a report from AppleInsider took a comparison look at previous Galaxy S models' first-month sales, writing that the Galaxy S7 saw 7-9 million units shipped in its first month, and the Galaxy S4 sold 10 million. The publication further wrote that "Each year since reaching Peak Galaxy in 2014, Samsung has floated the idea that its new model has outpaced sales, shipments (or sometimes "preorders") of the previous edition, but in reality Galaxy S sales—and subsequently Samsung Mobile profits—have actually never recovered since the Galaxy S4". Prior to the official release, it was reported that some Galaxy S8 displays had a bad white balance , causing them to exhibit a reddish tint. [103] Samsung stated that the Galaxy S8 was "built with an adaptive display that optimizes the colour range, saturation, and sharpness depending on the environment", but noted that the device's operating system provides settings for manually adjusting the display's appearance and white balance. [103] [104] [105] On 21 April, Samsung stated that the red tinting was purely a software issue, and would be patched in a future update. [106] The Investor reported that Samsung would replace the affected devices if a software update did not fix the issue. [107] Updates in various regions started rolling out in early May, fixing the issue. Reports surfaced at the end of April that some Galaxy S8 devices were "restarting by themselves". Samsung has not yet commented on the issue. Shortly after the phone's unveiling, bloggers produced a video showing that the Galaxy S8's facial recognition scanner could be tricked to unlock the phone by showing it a photo of the user. [113] [114] In a statement to Business Insider , a Samsung spokesperson stated that "Facial recognition is a convenient action to open your phone – similar to the 'swipe to unlock' action. We offer the highest level of biometric authentication – fingerprint and iris – to lock your phone and authenticate access to Samsung Pay or Secure Folder". In May 2017, researchers from the Chaos Computer Club posted a video showing that the S8's iris recognition system can be fooled with a contact lens and a suitable photograph of an eye. [116] Samsung told BBC News that it was "aware of the issue", and stated that "If there is a potential vulnerability or the advent of a new method that challenges our efforts to ensure security at any time, we will respond as quickly as possible to resolve the issue". In October 2017, Galaxy S8 users reported on Reddit that they were unable to receive SMS messages, with no fix available and without any comment from Samsung. ^ Galaxy Note 8 & Galaxy S8 Don't Support Project Treble on Oreo. ^ Smith, Chris (24 May 2017).

Samsung Galaxy S8: Specs, price, availability, problems, and more!. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have already been around for months, but they're still among the best phones you can buy.. Galaxy S8 and S8+: The basics. Samsung is an absolutely massive player in the smartphone space, and that all comes down from up high with the flagship Galaxy S line. The Galaxy S8 and its larger partner the Galaxy S8+ , build on the core features and experiences from the Galaxy S7 and bring things into the future with great new design and a few eye-catching features that are all new for 2017. They go along with the Galaxy Note 8 , which is slightly bigger and features an S Pen stylus, to form a trio of great hardware and meaningful software updates.. Here's everything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+.. The two phones, which are only differentiated by their screen size and battery capacity, come in at 5.8-inches and 6.2-inches with extra-tall 18.5:9 aspect ratio displays. That battery difference is pretty subtle: 3500mAh for the Galaxy S8+ and 3000mAh for the standard Galaxy S8. You may note that the Galaxy S8+'s battery is actually 100mAh smaller than the Galaxy S7 edge of last year, while the Galaxy S8's is the same size as the Galaxy S7 despite being a larger phone.. Though the batteries haven't increased in size, the hope is that the improved efficiency of the new 10 nm processor inside — that'll be the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 or the Samsung Exynos 8895, depending on the region — will provide some help. The processor is backed up by 4GB of RAM, an increase to 64GB of storage, and of course a microSD card slot. Waterproofing and wireless charging are still here as well, plus a new USB-C port on the bottom. The rear camera is unchanged in terms of its 12MP sensor and f/1.7 lens, but has improved processing thanks to new software and a new ISP (image signal processor).. This is some beautiful hardware all around.. The overall design for the phones is identical on both sizes, and is still shimmering glass and metal much like the previous generation. It's punctuated by the long edges of the displays curving subtly off the side, more so like the Galaxy Note 7 than the more dramatic Galaxy S7 edge — and to that point, there is no "edge" model here, as both phones sport the curves.. Get familiar with all of the Galaxy S8's specs. The displays have an 18.5:9 aspect ratio with a QHD+ resolution, meaning they're extra tall while staying relatively narrow. Samsung has also moved to on-screen buttons and reduced bezel size dramatically in order to fit as much screen into the body as possible. That necessitated the movement of the fingerprint sensor to the back of the phones, where it sits somewhat-awkwardly next to the camera lens. Iris scanning makes its return in a new-and-improved version from the Note 7 to try and pick up the slack.. Samsung is trying to drive a narrative that we've moved beyond specs (and you can definitely argue that we have), but the enthusiasts will always want to know the details of what's powering the latest phones. You get just about everything in here that you'd expect. Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 or Samsung Exynos 8895.

As for the two different models, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are identical internally aside from the batteries and of course screen sizes.. On the face of it, the spec hounds among us won't be satisfied with the fact that Samsung has stuck with the same camera specs from the Galaxy S7 in the new Galaxy S8. Yes, that means we're looking at a 12MP "Dual Pixel" camera with an f/1.7 lens — but remember that the software and ISP (image signal processor) have been improved since last year, and this was arguably the best camera of 2016. On the other side, Samsung has completely revamped the front-facing camera to an 8MP unit with autofocus — all the better for your selfies of all types.. How does it all come together? Here's Daniel's take from our Galaxy S8 review :. Since the Galaxy S8 has the same fundamentals as its predecessor, it's still one of the fastest, most reliable cameras on any phone. [...] Unlike some of the other substantive hardware improvements, the Galaxy S8's rear camera is another solid effort, but not more.. There are some new software features in the Galaxy S8. Oreo is on its way (again). Compared to the Galaxy S7, the Galaxy S8 takes naturally sharper photos (meaning it uses less artificial sharpening), and also takes less-saturated and more accurate photos. Those are both overall quality improvements, while the GS8 also remains lightning quick with lots of extra software features to boot.. The Galaxy S8 has what it takes to capture wonderful photos with extreme reliability, but unlike this time last year, it is challenged overall by the flagship competition — namely the LG G6 , Google Pixel 2 and HTC U11 .. Everything you need to know about the Galaxy S8's cameras. As Samsung often does, we got a good sneak peek at the Galaxy S8's software experience in the form of the Android Nougat update for the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. But there are some changes to make note of.. What you'll find on the Galaxy S8 is very similar in terms of its design, core apps and behaviors, but you'll also find a new launcher layout, new icons, on-screen buttons and of course a bunch of new features. Not the least of which being Bixby, DeX, S Pen-styled note-taking features and more.. A complete look at the Galaxy S8's software in our review. This is Samsung's DeX desktop dock for the Galaxy S8. Samsung takes it time with major software updates, but in recent years has been using a beta program to squash bugs and let enthusiasts play with the new software a bit early. That's still true this year with the upcoming update to Android 8.0 Oreo. Standard Oreo features such as notification channels , Google's auto-fill service and general speed improvements are all present. There are also Samsung-exclusive features coming such as Edge lighting and improvements to the always-on display. The experience overall should be familiar for current customers, with subtle but meaningful improvements.. Unfortunately, we will have to wait a bit longer. Samsung stated there was an issue with the release build of Oreo that would cause devices to reboot unexpectedly. Because of this, the company paused the initial Oreo roll-out and will send a new, (hopefully) less buggy update in the future.. More: Samsung Galaxy S8 Oreo update: Top features + what's new!. More: Android Oreo rollout resumes for Galaxy S8/S8+. Compare the Galaxy S8 today's hot devices. Where to buy the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+. Far on the other end of interaction from Bixby is the new "DeX" desktop docking system for the Galaxy S8. It's a little piece of hardware no larger than a wireless charger that lets you plug in your Galaxy S8, attaching it to a keyboard, mouse and monitor to transform it into a desktop-like environment. The Galaxy S8's interface scales up gracefully to fill the large monitor, and Samsung's own apps have been designed to be resized and operated with a keyboard and mouse.. Samsung has also struck deals with Adobe and Microsoft to bring their most popular apps to the big screen — the only question is how it works with other non-optimized apps, and who will invest in these docks and this setup to use DeX on a regular basis.. Recently, Samsung announced DeX would be improving in a huge way: full-blown Linux. The upcoming "Linux on Galaxy" app will let developers use whatever build of Linux they'd like within DeX. It's still a long way to go before replacing a full computer, but it's a big step in the right direction.. Samsung DeX review: This isn't a replacement for your laptop. Plenty of people will just pick up the Galaxy S8 or S8+ because Samsung is the brand they know, but many of us will comparing it head to head with other leading devices. To help you make up your mind on which phone is right for you, we've compared the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ to the likes of the Pixel and Pixel XL, LG G6 and of course the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Now that the Galaxy S9 has been announced, we also have a comparison with that.. Google Pixel 2: Which should you buy? Galaxy S8 vs. Galaxy Note 8: Which should you buy? Galaxy S8 and S8+ vs. Pixel and Pixel XL: Two ways to do a flagship Galaxy S8 vs. LG G6: Tall, skinny and very similar Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7: Battle of the platforms. So now that you have all the information, which one should you buy? You have a big phone and a bigger phone; one with a big battery and a bigger battery. There are so few differences between the Galaxy S flagships this year that it comes down to size and battery preference alone, and that may make your decision even harder.. Should you buy a Galaxy S8 or a Galaxy S8+?. In the U.S., you'll have your choice of the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+, both in 64GB storage configuration, in one of three colors: black, silver, or orchid grey. You can also pick up a proper U.S. unlocked model from Samsung or Best Buy if you don't want to bother with a carrier. Prices are in the range of $720-750 for the Galaxy S8, and $820-$850 for the Galaxy S8+, though you can find them for less on Amazon and other retailers. Finally, there's a gorgeous burgundy red mode , but it's only available in South Korea for now.. The Galaxy S9 is now official, meaning the S8 is likely to be discounted in the months ahead. If you have your eyes on the S8 or S8+, wait a bit and let the price drop.. Where to buy the Galaxy S8 in the U.S. Where to buy the Galaxy S8 in Canada. Bixby was a bit of a mixed bag when it debuted on the Galaxy S8, but it's grown up since then. Rather than compete with Google Assistant with cloud knowledge, Bixby is geared more towards local interactions on the phone itself. This ranges from mundane tasks like toggling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on and off to setting up elaborate chain reactions rivaling Tasker. For those that don't like Bixby, fear not: the Bixby button can now be completely disabled .. More: Samsung Bixby: Everything you need to know!. The Galaxy S9 has been announced, but that doesn't mean the S8 isn't worth a look. The S9 and S9+ are an iterative upgrade over the S8 and S8+, with a very similar design, new internals, more natural fingerprint sensor placement and slightly better cameras. The S8 will likely be heavily discounted once the S9 launches, so those new features may not be worth the extra cost.. More: Samsung Galaxy S9 & S9+: Everything you need to know!.

Nothing comes close to the Galaxy S8 design-wise. It’s the best-looking phone I’ve ever seen, leaving every other handset trailing in its wake.. The curved rear, as seen on the Galaxy S7, nestles perfectly in your palm, while the glass shimmers as the light hits it. The device is available in three colours – a dark black, bright silver and a grey with a blueish tinge – with no ugly white front plate in sight.. My review unit is the black option, and it’s properly black all over, with shiny sides that blend into the display. It feels like one complete piece, with the glass, screen and metal combining all together.. The volume rocker and standby switch are joined by a new button on the side. This is a dedicated Bixby button –. which I’ll cover in more detail in the Software section – and while it shows Samsung is taking its new virtual assistant seriously, it feels too much for Bixby to have its own button.. The S8 is thin and incredibly light at 155g, but it feels sturdy and precisely made. The last time Samsung opted for a huge change of direction with its flagship, many of the basic features were lost in the transition. Thankfully, this isn’t the case here. A microSD slot continues to sit tucked away with the nano-SIM, the criminally underrated Qi wireless charging is also present, and the device is IP68 water- and dust-resistant too, so it will survive a dunk in water for 30 minutes to depths of 1.5 metres.. Samsung has also retained the headphone jack; I’d be very surprised to hear that anyone thinks that’s a bad idea. Apple’s decision to remove a physical headphone connection looked like it might signal the demise of the 3.5mm jack, but Samsung has gone in the other direction, by including a pair of very good AKG wired buds in the box.. Like the recently launched LG G6 , the front of the Samsung Galaxy S8 is almost all screen – and it’s this that really makes the S8 stand out. Unlike with the G6, though, the display here melts into the sturdy metal rim.. Related: Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 review. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Accidental touches were common on older Edge phones, with your hand hitting the screen when you were just holding the device, but I haven’t experienced this with the S8. There’s still a bit of extra reflection on this portion of the screen, but it’s a small trade-off for such an eye-catching look.. As with any phone, though, not everything is perfect. Having such a big display and tiny bezel means there’s no room for the fingerprint-sensing Home button to sit on the front.. Instead, it’s on the back, next to the camera, and I hate it more every time I use it. First, it’s tiny, meaning those times I actually hit it, it doesn’t recognise my finger. But its real issue is the positioning; it’s so unintuitive. You have to wiggle your finger around the camera – which, incidentally, throws up a message on opening the app to remind you to clean dirty smudges of the lens – and guess where the scanner is?. I don’t understand why it isn’t at the centre, as it is every other phone that has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. I suspect Samsung wanted to build it into the display, but just ran out of time.. I’m also not convinced about how well this phone will hold up after months and years of use. The addition of Gorilla Glass 5 on both the front and back should offer a little more protection, but I’ve ended up with both a cracked Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S7 after drops onto carpet from barely 2ft high. Hopefully, things will be different with the Galaxy S8 – but it feels like a delicate phone.. The strange position of the fingerprint scanner. The phone is also prone to showing fingerprints, but that’s par for the course with this amount of glass and shiny metal. I’d go with the Midnight Grey colour option if you’re really averse to smudges.. Not only has Samsung crafted what is, in my opinion, the best-looking phone out there, but it’s slapped on the finest display too. Although, when you consider that Samsung has demonstrated the best screen tech for a number of years, this isn’t really a surprise.. There’s more to the display than just the curves. First, it has a new aspect ratio of 18.5:9, rather than 16:9. This means it’s taller, essentially giving you more space in a body that isn’t that much bigger than that of the S7. While the Galaxy S7 had a 5.1-inch display, the S8 bumps that to 5.8.. It sounds huge, but the phone itself is compact and Samsung is keen to point out that it can still be used comfortably in one hand. I wouldn’t say that you can do quite ‘everything’ with one hand – especially reaching to pull down the notification tray – but this is far from a phablet.. The 5.8-inch display size is in some ways deceiving, however. Don’t pick up this phone thinking it will have the same size of screen as the Nexus 6P or HTC U Ultra in a much smaller body. This is a tall screen and it’s bigger than the S7, but it’s much narrower than proper phablets. Width-wise, it’s barely wider than an iPhone 7 and noticeably narrower than the Pixel XL.. Like the majority of Samsung phones, the panel is AMOLED and has a slightly odd quad-HD+ 2960 x 1440 resolution. It’s also ‘Mobile HDR Premium’ certified, so you’ll be able to stream HDR (high dynamic range) shows from Amazon Prime and Netflix when those apps are updated. Arguably, HDR is the most important evolution in TV tech is recent years, offering better contrast and a brighter picture.. Colours are gloriously vivid, but it manages to avoid oversaturating brighter shades while still displaying the deepest black. Like the iPhone 7, it covers the DCI-P3 cinema-grade colour gamut for a much wider spectrum of colours, and in certain situations, the brightness can break the 1000-nit barrier. Considering most phones, including the LG G6, only go up to about 650 nits, this is seriously impressive stuff. In fact, this screen is so bright that I can keep it on 25% brightness and it’s perfectly visible indoors.. In a move that’s surely to try to stretch out the fairly small 3000mAh battery, when you unbox your Galaxy S8 it will be set to display at 1080p rather than quad-HD. Most people probably won’t notice the difference – and that’s fine. But I’d suggest hopping into Settings and switching things up. Downscaling can leave some apps with oddly big fonts and a softer look on texts and icons; considering you’re spending £600/$700+ on a phone, you’ll probably want it to look its best.. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is the best phone out there for media binging, and I’ve started picking it up instead of my iPad when I want to watch something on the go. There’s a clever mode called ‘Video Enhancer’, which boosts the contrast and brightness in certain apps – Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and so on – to give a pseudo-HDR effect. I wouldn’t recommend keeping it on all the time, due to the increased battery drain, but it does make a fantastic display even better.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

Verdict and other phones to consider. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a phone that should be one of the very first you look at when deciding which new phone you buy.. The large, bezel-less display is truly iconic and beautiful, and the screen quality excellent. The fingerprint scanner being placed on the back of the phone is a poor decision from Samsung, as well as the iris scanner / facial recognition not working anywhere near well enough to be a real consideration. However, these aren’t deal breakers, and the improved battery life and tweaked camera will be among the best you’ll find on a top-end flagship.. The Galaxy S8 is an expensive phone - have no doubts about that - but it’s one that we consider to be well worth the investment.. Samsung Galaxy S8 price Between £30-40 for free on contract, £639 SIM-free $30 to $31.25 on US carriers, $724.99 SIM-free AU$1,199 to purchase the S8 outright, with plans from AU$65/month. Not seeing eye to eye Biometrics add time to unlocking the phone Fingerprint scanner in a poor place Facial recognition infuriating A sluggish start for Bixby Bixby still fails to impress Very much a future feature Bixby Vision adds unnecessary bloat to the camera Bixby's big chance: why this is the perfect time to relaunch. The Samsung Galaxy is a phone that's unlike anything you'll have seen on the market. It's just stunning - and we've spent a few months testing out its workings properly.. It's incredibly expensive in a world where mid-range phones are more than good enough to handle most tasks people like... but the second you pick it up it's easy to see why.. The screen is just brilliant - the clearest, sharpest and offers lovely color reproduction to make movie watching a dream, and that's before you've even got to the fact it's wrapped into the chassis so hugely that it has a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus in a chassis that feels more like the iPhone 7.. The Galaxy S8 isn't perfect - in the search to squeeze the screen in so completely, other factors were overlooked: namely, the placement of the fingerprint reader. If you want this phone, you'll need to answer this question: are you OK using an iris scanner?. And if you're looking for something even bigger, and with a much-improved battery life to boot, then the Galaxy S8 Plus is easily the way to go - check out our review of that to see if that's the phone for you.. But the Galaxy S8 is firmly a phone that rises above those points to combine everything into a handset that really impresses in the hand, fitting seamlessly into day-to-day life (as long as you can get over the dizzying price).. The Samsung Galaxy S8 isn’t the cheapest phone on the market by any stretch of the imagination; in fact, it’s one of the most expensive. You’re really paying for that screen.. That said, we've seen the price drop quite a bit in recent months since the launch of the Galaxy Note 8 and the rumored appearance of the Galaxy S9.. In the UK, the contract price is already dropping rapidly. Some deals offer the phone for way less than £30 per month with a substantial amount of internet included. To find the best deal for you, check out our selection of the best Samsung Galaxy S8 deals in the UK.. Or, you can purchase it SIM-free for a whopping £639. We've seen the price fluctuate to a little bit below that mark but the price has moved both up and down in the past.. In the US you're going to pay between. $30 to $31.25 a month for this phone with a 24-month contract through American carriers like Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile.. For $724.99, there's an unlocked Samsung Galaxy S8 in the US. If you want to go SIM-free right away or want any other unlocked color, you'll have to pay off one of the carriers first.. In Australia, you’re looking at a shade under AU$1,200 to get your hands on the phone outright.. On a contract from the major Aussie telcos, prices start at around AU$65/month for basic options (the latter price will get you 500MB of data and $300 worth of calls and texts from Virgin Mobile), but if you want something a little more substantial (ie. with more than a couple of gigs of data), there are quite competitive plans starting at around AU$70/month from Optus, with Telstra's better offerings (such as its 5GB 'M' plan) costing AU$85 or more.. The slightly good news is that you’re at least getting a 64GB version of this phone in all territories; the presence of a microSD slot means Samsung won’t be launching multiple variants of the phone in different regions, instead offering a decent amount of storage as standard and giving users the option to add to that if they so wish.. We spent a week thoroughly testing the Samsung Galaxy S8 when it first came out - watch our video below to see how we got on.. Right, let’s get down to business – and we’ll start with the thing that’s concerning us most about the Galaxy S8.. The main issue we have with this phone centers around how you’ll get into it – most smartphones users now expect to use a fingerprint to unlock their device, making it secure and meaning you don’t have to peck in your PIN a billion times a day.. It’s a good idea, it’s safe enough for most people, and it just works – we’re all in agreement there.. With the Galaxy S6 , Samsung got biometric unlocking right, but annoyingly with the Galaxy S8 things have become difficult and confusing.. You can unlock this phone with your face, a fingerprint or an iris scan, in increasing order of security level, making the S8 one of the most secure phones around (assuming nobody knows your PIN, of course, which is the backup method of entry).. However, in creating the massive screen on the front of the Galaxy S8, Samsung has moved the fingerprint scanner to the rear of the phone – and placed it out of the reach of most fingers when holding your phone naturally.. As a result, you’ll need to shift the handset to an unnatural position in your palm to reach the scanner with your digit, and thanks to the elongated lozenge-like shape of the fingerprint sensor it can take a couple of attempts to register.. It also makes it less stable in the hand and prone to being dropped. And in terms of it being uncomfortable in the hand, the Galaxy S8 Plus takes it to the next level, with an even harder time of reaching the scanner at the top.. You will find over a few months' use that you'll get used to this - we've found after intensive testing it's not terrible... The fingerprint scanner, then, is too far away to use naturally. So how about iris scanning? Well, it’s the best implementation we’ve seen from Samsung ( far better than we’ve seen on the flammable Note 7) but it’s still not perfect.. There are times when it’s flawless, where you’ll just turn the phone on and be instantly unlocked as the S8 has spotted your eyes and confirmed your identity. (Or just thinks you’ve got lovely irises and wants to impress you… either way, it’s rapid).. On the occasions when it works like this you’ll experience a genuine sense of living in the future.. Other times, when you’re walking or in lower light, the iris scanner just failed time and again (although weirdly it works fine in the pitch-dark).. This meant we sometimes ended up gurning (by the way, we urge you to search YouTube for the gurning world championships ) at the S8, trying to force the issue by opening our eyes really wide and moving the phone around in order to unlock it.. On the train, this is not acceptable behavior – and after a couple of days, it actually made our eyes hurt, pushing them out on stalks so often.. There were also times when the iris scanner wouldn’t work even in optimal conditions (sitting still in bright light), and only a restart sorted this issue out.. If you’re going to make people switch to an iris scanner by putting the fingerprint sensor out of reach, then make it flawless, not brilliant-most-of-the-time-but-sometimes-not.. Over a week or so we did get used to the nuances of the iris scanner; it’s fine – it’s just mildly irritating to have to hold your phone in a certain way, and it’s useless while walking or wearing sunglasses (although it did work through regular glasses).. Facial recognition – despite being the default out of the box – is a non-starter for us. The phone fails to recognise your face far too often, it doesn’t work in low light, and it can be spoofed by a photo. There's nothing more infuriating about this feature than the fact you can't see if you're 'positioning' your face correctly. There's definitely an angle to hold it at that's optimal... but you have no idea what it is, or why.. This issue has been increased now that Apple has invested seemingly billions in creating invisible dots that fire into your face to verify your identity the same way... the iPhone X is big competition to the Galaxy S8 as a result.. What users now expect from flagship phones – and what Samsung had done perfectly before – is a simple, muscle memory action that opens your phone. No extra pressing, no having to interact with the phone to open it up – just one single press to be securely into your handset.. The workaround we ended up with (as we’re not leaving our phones unlocked, which is what some might be tempted to do) is to use Smart Lock, where you can set up trusted places or connected devices to confirm your identity.. This means that if you leave your phone lying around at work or at home someone can jump right into it though, so you’re basically just preventing a thief from being able to access data if you lose the Galaxy S8 on the train.. In short, Samsung appears to have screwed this one up. We’d heard rumors that the brand was trying to add in a new feature where the fingerprint was in the same place as on the S7 (at the base of the phone) but actually under the screen.. That would have been perfect, as it’s the way most people fire up the screen anyway.. But clearly Samsung couldn’t make this work effectively, so decided to shove the fingerprint scanner way up the back of the S8, as that was the only place left to put it that didn’t require some last-minute retooling of the phone.. the only logical explanation, as otherwise why wouldn’t the fingerprint scanner be above the Samsung logo, which would be a perfect place for it?. The other big feature that’s launched with the Samsung Galaxy S8 is Bixby, the brand’s voice assistant rival to Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Google's less-interestingly-named Assistant.. Those who've used the Galaxy S3 and S4 will remember that Samsung already tried to match Siri with S Voice, but it was a bit pointless, especially when Google's voice chops got so gosh-darn good.. Well, Bixby is Samsung’s big play in its bid to compete in the arena of artificially intelligent assistants, and it clearly thinks it can succeed despite being so late to the game.. The aim here is to make Bixby an indispensable accompaniment to your daily life, reminding you of things when you need them, letting you know what you're looking at, and being a single-button one-stop shop for all the information you need.. In fact Samsung is so confident that Bixby is going to be brilliant that it's popped a button dedicated solely to this function on the side of the phone.. Yep, a phone that's so tightly designed that it can't even have the fingerprint scanner in an accessible place has a whole key dedicated to Bixby… and it's very hard to see why right now.. Bixby is pretty mundane though, despite having voice functionality added in now. It's currently only South Korean and US English and it's inherently inaccurate for voice.. We tested for a while, but as it can't support many third party apps or properly understand what's being said - even to a US speaker - it seems a bit futile. It will probably get better over time, but most people won't care about that.. In the UK, one would assume it wouldn't be too long – but then again, that region was expecting Samsung Pay a while ago, and it's only just turning up.. So what does Bixby mean to you, the new phone buyer? Well, nothing. It's average at best, and pretty much useless at worst.. Bixby Vision, a little icon that lives in the corner of the camera, will be able to analyze what's being shown through the camera's viewfinder (both live and from a taken pic) and let you know whether you can buy it, recognize the image and given information or let you know about a place you're checking out.. Except the results of image recognition just show you things on Pinterest, the shopping element seems to recognize almost nothing at launch and the places option is pretty patchy. It's slow to work out what it’s looking at and, overall, it’s just a waste of screen right now.. Bixby Home, the screen that lives to the side of the home screen, is much better.. It's contextual and interesting, and you can pin your favorite elements (like Spotify, for instance) to the top for easy access from anywhere in the phone.. It's nothing earth-shattering, but it's pretty neat – although there is a maddening pause every time you open it for the first time, as if Bixby is trying to remember where it left its home page.. The good news is you can disable the Bixby button from opening the Home screen, which is great as so many times we hit it instead of the volume key. And then there's Bixby Reminders, where you'll be alerted to things you've made a note of in the past. You can set a location trigger to remind you to buy fruit when you pass a location, or ping you at a certain time to remind you to call someone.. None of this is exactly new though, and there's absolutely no reason why you'd buy the Samsung Galaxy S8 for Bixby.. Samsung is pretty jazzed about Bixby, and the fact that it'll be able to understand things contextually in the future. Right now it only can work with a handful of native apps (not even all of them...) and there’s no interaction with third-party options. But from this acorn, Samsung insists, a mighty oak will grow.. Imagine not just being able to set a location to buy fruit, but being pinged when somewhere nearby sells it.. Or taking a picture of something and finding it far cheaper online straight away, or being able to ask your phone to do things contextually (for instance: ‘Bixby, can you turn on the heating when I’m twenty minutes from home?’ ‘Bixby, upload those pictures from my run today to Facebook with the caption ‘#blessed #squadgoals #ImsorryforwhoI’vebecome).. That's the world Samsung is promising, and if you purchase the S8 you'll be buying into that promise. However, right now, that's all it is... and there’s no way we can recommend a phone based on a promise, as Samsung could just pull the plug on a feature like Bixby if it really can't get it to work properly, and a few months on we've seen nothing that suggests it's going to conquer the world of AI..

Please make sure that you are posting in the form of a question.. Don't see what you're looking for?. There was a problem completing your request. Please try your search again later.. The revolutionary design of the Galaxy S8 begins from the inside out. We rethought every part of the phone's layout to break through the confines of the smartphone screen so all you see is pure content and no bezel. It's the biggest, most immersive screen on a Galaxy smartphone of this size, and it's easy to hold in one hand.. The Infinity Display sets a new standard for uninterrupted, immersive experiences. It enables an expanded screen size without necessitating a larger phone. So while the view is grander, Galaxy S8 feels small in your hand, making them easy to hold and use.. The big screen that feels small. You'll immediately notice the comfortable grip of the smooth curves, which allow you to hold on easily while you watch movies on the larger screen. And important short cuts are a swipe away, as the edge screen is available on both Galaxy S8.. Complementing the uniform front is the equally smooth silhouette on the back. The rear camera sits perfectly flush with the surface for a visually tranquil profile.. The phone that opens up new worlds. More screen means more is seen. Be it movies or games, you'll get drawn into the action on the Galaxy S8 screen. With the 18.5:9 display ratio, you get the whole scene on your screen.. Text while you watch a movie, or make a list while you browse. You're able to multitask efficiently due to the bigger screen, and you can choose what your focus is by easily resizing the windows. And when just one thing has your attention, you'll see more of the article or your social media feed, so you scroll less.. The new navigation keys are no different from the physical ones you're used to, but now they're beautifully inconspicuous—until you need them. The home key is where it normally is, and it works just as usual with a simple press.. Enjoy seamless navigation on the Galaxy S8 with a sleek and clean interface that aligns beautifully with the smooth Infinity Display. As you unlock from the AOD (Always-On Display) and switch between apps, the visual journey on screen is just as striking as the exterior..

After owning the phone long enough to be familiar with it, I thought I would leave a decent review outlining some of the pro's and con's, as well as some neutral's. My review is as follows: (see end comments about unlocked and verizon use - this phone is 100% unlocked!) Pro's: 1. Very nice screen and overall a great phone. I took amazing outdoor and indoor (even in low light/no light) pictures. I am genuinely impressed and was not expecting it to be so good. Photo on phone was taken by s8) 3. I got the s8 because I did not want a huge computer in my pocket, and it has plenty of room in it. The processor even with battery settings set to a mid level (which can be changed to your personal preference) is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it. Plenty of ram to handle multi-tasking and plenty of storage to handle those 4k videos/pictures PLUS room to expand with SD storage, which is also getting much better and bigger. I was also not expecting such great sound. You will have no trouble hearing anything even in a loud environment. Simply put, the AMOLED allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well. The lowest I have had the battery is about 60% and it charged in under an hour. As stated in #7, it helps with battery life but other than that, it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity. I also carified in #3 that the screen size and pixel ratio were simply stunning. You will notice this if you game alot or during those 4k picture zooms and probably much more on the s8+. It has a headphone jack! lol. The accessories that came with the phone are great. A fast charging cable, a type-c to mini usb extension, and a usb to type-c extension as well. The headphones are simply amazing too. By far some of the best I have owned, as far as ear buds go, and you don't have to pay for good quality here. The material of them is great and they come with extra different size earbuds. While I have not tested it, and probably never will, it's a great feature. I still don't recommend dunking your phone. There is an option to keep the screen off while in your pocket, or something like a purse. If you butt dial, you probably are not navigating the settings well enough. Keep in mind, android has A LOT of settings, and it would be wise to go through them all including the basic options that samsung offers. You can actually adjust the size of every single widget, and fit more apps on the pages as well as the default home row. You can also change the lock screen apps, if you want any at all. I personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen, and keep all my apps on a single page, in folders, the weather, a google search bar with the mic button, and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto-sync buttons etc etc.. All on one page, with plenty of empty space. Half the screen is even still empty. Thank you so much for resizeable widgets. The button is below the volume buttons, so nothing you can do there. Most reviews on here are failing to realize this and also failing to outline how. See the end of my review for simple instructions. Maybe I am just to used to an older, smaller phone, but one handed operations is going to take some getting used to. Be mindful of the edges of the screen too. Too much palm and you will be scrolling. I do not see this as a negative still, just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro's section, the overall screen size is perfect. A bit torn on this one. It seems cool, but is pretty much useless. It's basically a notification before the notification. So you would have to tap twice and then unlock as well. IMHO, it does look really cool, but SAMSUNG needs to give us more control over it. This can also be turned off. I find it 100% useless, but not a negative by any means. I feel it can definitely cater to some users who enjoy always being able to look at their phone. I personally disabled it and honestly looked no further into it. I have always disliked samsung's default colors. However, there is an option to change them to your liking. I chose the basic setting, but there is even an option to change balance which let's you arrange a set of liked color boxes, whites, and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference. It really is a great setting, however, it is a neutral and not a pro simply because they enable a very rich color by default. So I recommend changing this to suite your own eyeballs. In order to change the lock screen clock, you have to register with samsung themes and install a theme, which can be somewhat custom. I did this, and the deactivated my account. The setting were retained and all is well. Still a neutral because I feel samsung should incorporate a way to change the lock screen clock by default to a couple preset clocks. The standard one IMHO, is ugly and not aesthetically pleasing to read. This is not a samsung issue, but android. I recommend going through every single option, and every single app to change every single setting. Sometimes, this can take the first week of owning an android phone to get right. This also almost always has a HUGE impact on battery life. There are settings in sub-menu's of settings. So please, NAVIGATE YOUR ANDROID SETTINGS! Your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all. It is due to negligence and laziness. This seems to always be on, even when turned off in googles settings. I have a search bar and I have turned off all settings both in the phone and google, but for some reason if you say those two naughty words, it still comes up. However, if you do not set it up, it will only be asking you to set it up. Same thing as bixby almost, but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on. I think samsung needs to address this before anything else, even the bixby issues some people are not liking or failing to change. The phone is not strong by any means. It does not feel like a cheap POS, but it is all glass. This belongs in the negative because most of us are drop prone, and even if you are not, it is very easy to make a mistake. Overall, it looks amazing, but there is no need for a glass backing too. I highly recommend you get a case, and if you are in fact drop prone, get a big durable case like an otterbox with a screen protector. The risk will always be there with all smart phones, but the s8 being all glass just seems pointless. That said, I have NEVER dropped a phone to a point where it broke (fingers crossed, knock on wood). What a stupid placement for a finger print scanner. Right next to the camera lense? come on... I personally do not use it at all, but if I did and wanted to take a picture, you would be cleaning your lense as soon as you unlocked it. Nobody wants to take an unclear photo because they used the finger print security feature. I like the Google Plus one, but feel that if any, Apple has the best one being in the home button. On a side note: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. If you do not pay attention to who or where you buy it from, at least leave a sellers review instead of a product review. 99% of the negative reviews are this. Please pay attention and buy a new phone from Amazon only. I do not ever recommend getting a refurb on this kind of product, or buying from a private seller regardless of their rating. As for Bixby, all you have to do is not set it up and hold the home screen like you are adding a widget, scroll to the left and hit the button to turn it off. This will not remove it, but will stop it from doind whatever crazy stuff these other reviews are talking about. I have had NO ISSUES with bixby, because I turned it off. Also, make sure you go through your settings, including the subsettings imbedded into android like background data usage etc etc and turn it all off. People having battery issues, I guarantee it is not the s8's fault. It is android and you would not get any better life with iOS for failing to go through your settings. Over and over for a week until you find every nook and cranny. There is a lot! Overall, this phone is amazing. The list of pro's, con's, and neutral's are simply my take and my opinion. At least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it, go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it, but it's just not the same as owning it. I was torn between a google pixel xl and this one, but when this dropped in price it made my decision that much easier. I did like the idea of a bigger phone, however, I just kept thinking how big it would be in my pocket. So I went with the standard s8 and I am very happy I did. I do a lot of fishing, hiking, and outdoor stuff and 90% of the time, I TRY to keep my phone around me in my pocket in case of an emergency. Usually off, because where I go there is no signal anyways. Any review stating a mostly negative opinion, in my opinion, is probably a bit trollish or did not do any research and made an impulse buy. I think you can get used to this phone and if you are complaining about the things I have outlined here, the only one to blame is you. So give it a try, navigate ALL the settings, get used to android, and don't drop this phone lol! Thank you for reading.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars So far the best phone I ever had. Size: Galaxy S8 | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. So far the best phone I ever had. I did a comparison with my old phone and you certainly can feel that it's more powerful. I'm not used to it yet. I love shooting video and it nails it in video quality and it does slow motion!! say whaaaat!! But sometimes it overheats under the direct sun when I record video but I think that is normal. I don't use the fingerprint sensor only because I can't find it. And the mono speaker under the phone is a downside which most of the time I cover it with my little finger and it's kinda annoying. Other than that it's freaking fast and top notch phone. Make sure to check out the video and pictures and if my review was helpful please press YES for helpful. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great phone, activate yourself. Size: Galaxy S8 | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. I was skeptical about buying this phone off Amazon instead of Verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the Verizon network. My advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website. Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card, I was able to use the one from my iphone 6. Transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy. Other than that the actual phone is great. This phone is $756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower. If you're on the fence like I was I hope this review can help you out.. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Gorgeous hardware, same old Sammy.. Size: Galaxy S8 | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. This phone should be a no-brainer. Easily the most stunning display ever on a phone, great specs, Samsung Pay, expandable storage, and waterproofing SHOULD make this the best phone on the market. While Touchwiz isn't nearly the raging dumpster fire it was back in the S4 and S5 days, there's still a lot of extras that most will consider junk. Have you ever wondered what Siri would be like if it were dumber and had a dedicated hardware button? That's Bixby. Not content to let Google do the heavy lifting, Samsung's MO continues to be creating inferior versions of services already offered by Big G. Want to remap that button to something actually useful? Too bad. Samsung keeps patching the phone in order to force their bloatware down your throat. As it is, that's a dead button that you'll press once out of curiosity, and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume. One other annoyance of note is the horrible placement of the fingerprint scanner. There's just no excuse for this one. Overall, it's a great phone that's held back by Samsung's usual goofball decisions.. Was this review helpful to you?. I read the good, the bad, the ugly reviews and took my chances. 2-day shipping, little scratches on the box but at least the phone was in there. 5.0 out of 5 stars Phone works on T-Mobile.

Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus review: Almost to Infinity. by Nirave Gondhia 1 week ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Bixby is limited and needs work. No major improvements to the camera. Iris recognition is hit and miss. Bottom-firing speaker is average at best. Samsung's latest flagship has all the hallmarks of being one of the best phones of 2017, with its excellent design and outstanding display. However, its voice assistant needs a lot of polish to leave its current beta state. It might not be the absolute best phone, but as with previous years, it's likely to be the best phone for most users.. Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus specifications. Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8+.

With the Samsung Galaxy S9 just around the corner, we thought this would be a fun time to take a look back at our review for the current S8 family. After all, soon this will be a highly discounted model making it a potential purchase for those looking for a great phone but wishing to same some serious cash in the process.Â. The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge might have been two of the best phones of 2017, but the well-documented issues faced by the Galaxy Note 7 have cast a shadow over Samsungâs mobile efforts. From two fantastic smartphones to a phone that would have been near-perfect had it not spontaneously caught fire, 2016 was a year to remember and forget for Samsung, and its next flagship was always going to come under intense scrutiny.. Don’t miss: Where to buy the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. Ahead of its Unpacked event last month, Samsung flooded media with advertising designed to begin the painstaking process of rebuilding the customer faith that took years to accumulate. Then came the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, two phones that push the boundaries further than ever before, but do they offer enough?. In previous years, Samsungâs Galaxy S flagship(s) would almost certainly be the best phones of the year, but this year LG, Huawei, and Sony have all bought their very best to the market, and Samsungâs issues have presented a rare chink in its armor. Do the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus continue past trends of being the best Android smartphones? Find out in our Samsung Galaxy S8 review!. About this Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S8 review:. To bring our readers, and viewers, the most comprehensive review experience possible, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus were reviewed by two different members of Android Authority. While Joshua Vergara put together the video linked above, I, Nirave Gondhia, put together the in-depth written Samsung Galaxy S8 review encompassing both of our opinions to provide the definitive Android Authority view on Samsung’s latest flagship.. We have both been testing international versions of the Galaxy S8 with model number G950FÂ. running Android 7.0.1, with the March 2017Â. Our usage with the Galaxy S8 Plus (model number G955UÂ. on build number ending 1AQD9) was limited to only a few days and weâll be following up this review with additional testing around the battery, display, and performance in the comingÂ. Over the past few years, Samsung has transitioned away from its plastic past to a refinement of its glass and metal build, and the Galaxy S8 presents the future of this design language. Thereâs two sizes to the Galaxy S8 but neither comes with an Edge moniker, with Samsung calling its taller curved screens the Infinity Display.Â. The focus with this yearâs phones isnât the curved display however, but more so how Samsung has managed to squeeze so much screen real estate into the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus. Thanks to the switch to a 18.5:9 formatÂ. and the removal of the home button and Samsung branding on the front, we have phones that feel a lot smaller than they should.. After years of criticism for its stubborn refusal to move past its plastic-clad design language, last year we finally saw a new Samsung emerge with the introduction of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. From plastic in 2014 to glass and metal in 2015, last year saw the biggest revolution in Samsungâs mobile portfolio since the launch of the first Galaxy S itself. The Galaxy S6 family was certainly â¦. We have phones that feel a lot smaller than they should. Think back to previous phones with displays of 5.5-inches or larger and they felt great at the time, but even the Galaxy Note 7 feels positively large compared to Samsungâs latest flagships. The 5.8-inch display inside the Galaxy S8 comes inside a body thatâs slightly taller but narrower than the Galaxy S7 (148.9 x 68.1 mm vs 142.4 x 69.6 mm). Similarly, the Galaxy S8 Plus is a little taller and wider than the Galaxy S7 Edge (159.5 x 73.4 mm vs 150.9 x 72.6 mm) despite a screen thatâs 0.7 inches smaller.. Both phones are a little thicker at 8 mm and 8.1 mm respectively, but the difference is negligible compared to the much better in-hand experience. The added screen real estate sees a bump in the weight as well, at 155 grams and 173 grams respectively, but this helps the Galaxy S8 feel more premium in the hand.. Moving around the phone, the volume keys are on the left and the power button on the right, as with previous Samsung phones. The left sees the addition of a dedicated shortcut for Bixby and Bixby Home, Samsungâs new AI assistant, which weâll touch on later. Up top is the SIM card tray while on the bottom, youâve got the headphone jack, USB Type-C port, and single bottom-firing speaker.. The back is where Samsung has made arguably the worst design decision on the Galaxy S8; removing the home button means Samsung had to find a place for the fingerprint sensor and they chose to combine it with the heart rate monitor next to the rear camera. While other OEMs have chosen to put fingerprint sensors in the center of the device, Samsungâs decision means it can have its logo right underneath the camera, but as a result, the fingerprint sensor is cumbersome to use.. The position doesnât feel natural and on the regular Galaxy S8, itâs a stretch with large hands, while on the Galaxy S8 Plus, itâs awkward unless you have very large hands. As youâll often be fumbling blindly to find the fingerprint sensor, you may end up with fingerprints on the camera lens itself, soÂ. Samsung has included a reminder when you launch the camera to wipe it down.. The location of the fingerprint sensor does render a very good sensor near-useless. Being forward-thinking and attempting to redefine the meaning of a big phone isnât without its challenges, and while Samsung has made an excellent attempt, the location of the fingerprint sensor does render a very good sensor near-useless. However, thanks to other biometric options, itâs a small compromise for what is one of the best-designed smartphones ever made.. Thanks to a taller screen, the removal of the home button, and bezels that are slimmer than ever, Samsung has managed to put a bigger screenÂ. in a footprint thatâs barely bigger than last year. Samsung is known for making stunning smartphones and the Galaxy S8 is its best yet, ushering in a new era of smartphone design and laying down a marker for Samsungâs rivals.. All of this leads to what weâve come to expect from Samsung displays â an extremely vivid Super AMOLED display that punches colors harder than before and is a joy to use. Rated as one of the first HDR-capable smartphones, the Galaxy S8 screen ups the brightness and color saturation of the screen when viewing content like YouTube and apps that support HDR, such as Netflix. Itâs a noticeable improvement when switching in and out of the app, but it means that the Galaxy S8 offers the best mobile entertainment experience on a smartphone to date.. The 18.5:9 aspect ratio means Samsung has managed to pack more pixels into its display, with the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus both offering displays at 2960 x 1440 pixels. On the Galaxy S8, this translates to a pixel density of 570 pixels per inch, while on the Galaxy S8 Plus this is a little lower at 529 pixels per inch.. The additional pixels mean a taller display overall, but there is some pillar-boxing when watching widescreen content so youâll have black bars on the sides. You might find the bars distracting for most media content, but you can force apps to full screen mode either through the display settings menu or by tapping the icon in the recent apps menu.. Out of the box, both phones come with the display scaled down to Full HD+ , but you can tweak this and things like color saturation in the display settings.. Samsung has found a way to preserve the original unlocking experience of previous Galaxy devices. The removal of the home button means a switch to soft keys, but Samsung has included a pressure sensitive area near the bottom of the display which vibrates when pressed hard enough and can be used for unlocking the phone when itâs asleep. Samsung has found a way to preserve the original unlocking experience of previous Galaxy devices, but the soft keys work well enough that you may almost forget the pressure sensitive button exists. On-screen keys allow you to swap the position of the “recent apps” and “back” keys, but unlike with other manufacturers, thereâs no option to add an additional key for the notification menu.. Running the Galaxy S8 display through our testing, we found the screen has a max brightness of 373 nits with auto brightness turned off and 515 nits with it turned on. During sunlight we found a visible punch in the brightness and although the display isn’t technically the brightest, it is definitely pleasing to the eye. With a color accuracy of 7180 Kelvin, the Galaxy S8 doesn’t have the most accurate display in its default out-of-the-box state, and has a warm tone, but with all of these effects turned off, the display is the closest we’ve come to the ideal temperature of 6500K with a temperature of 6440K.. Overall, the addition of so much real estate is a more than welcome trade-off to Samsung removing the home button and much of the experience remains the same otherwise, including the Edge UX and Always On Display, which have a couple of actionable additions. Past Samsung devices have always sported great looking displays, but the Galaxy S8 is in a class of its own and offers one of the most immersive experiences on a smartphone to-date.. As the latest Samsung flagship, you can expect the latest processing package and the Galaxy S8 doesnât fail to deliver. Depending on your market, you can either expect the latest Exynos 10nm chipset or the Snapdragon 835 , both coupled with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of on-board storage, which is expandable via a microSD card. The Exynos version comes with the Mali-G71 MP8 GPU while the Snapdragon 835 has the Adreno 540 GPU.. Related: Let’s give it to Samsung for making 64 GB standard in the Galaxy S8. As you might expect, there are no performance concerns with the processing stack that powers the Galaxy S8. During our Samsung Galaxy S8 review process weâve noticed no issues with performance in applications or while gaming. When running Super Mario Run and Jade Empire â which are both heavy mobile games â there were no issues with dropped frames or lag.. The Galaxy S8 also powers the DeX , Samsung’s new docking accessory that allows you to turn your Galaxy S8 into a full desktop computer. Itâs testament to the processing power of both chipsets that theyâre able to deliver a full desktop experience with little more than a couple of small hiccups and ever so slight latency when recognizing the input from a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.. When the iris scanner can see your eyes unobstructed, it is lightning fast. The only noticeable performance issue I personally experienced is with the iris recognition which, like on the Galaxy Note 7, fails to work properly if you wear glasses. Samsung warns you to remove glasses or contact lenses when setting up the iris recognition, but this means youâll have to either look over the top of your glasses or lift them up for iris recognition to be useful. Josh hasnât had any issues with this, so it might be an issue with my handset and when the iris scanner can see your eyes unobstructed, it is lightning fast.. As you might expect, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus come equipped with a heavy hardware stack which includes expandable storage, a 32-bit audio DAC, dual-band Wi-Fi, and a plethora of connectivity options.. You can connect to two Bluetooth speakers or headphones at the same time and play audio through both simultaneously. The Galaxy S8 is also one of the first phones to support Bluetooth 5 , which brings with it a much longer range and the ability to have an active connection with two different devices. In the real world, this means you can connect to two Bluetooth speakers or a speaker and headset at the same time and play audio through both simultaneously .. Right next to the USB Type-C port on the bottom of the phone is the single bottom-firing speaker and the headphone jack. The loudspeaker has the same issues that are inherent to its design, mainly a tinny sound,Â. and overall, itâs decent at best. Samsungâs acquisition of Harman Kardon should eventually result in much better audio, but it likely came too late for the speakers on the Galaxy S8.. However, with the headphone jack, Samsung has taken a different approach by focusing on headphones instead of including a third-party DAC or built-in amp. Instead, theyâve included a pair of high-quality earphones made by AKG, and while we have a full review of these headphones coming soon, we can say they are significantly better than the headphones included with any other phones.. The headphones are surprisingly “bassy” for small earphones and feature a premium feeling design that includes a fabric cable and in-line controls. Diving deep into the sound settings, thereâs a bunch of equalizer toggles that can be used to cater the audio experience to your preferences. Thereâs an Adapt Sound tutorial that helps you tune the output to your own ears and the result is a headphone experience that manages to be surprisingly deep for the average user. Given whatâs happened in a short-space of time, we expect Samsungâs acquisition of Harman Kardon to result in a vastly improved audio experience on future flagships.. The biggest issue facing Samsung with the Galaxy S8 is the fear that still resides from the Galaxy Note 7âs batteries catching fire spontaneously. Personally, I think the company has played it a little safe with the battery capacity inside its new flagships, in a bid to prevent any issues with the battery.. Rather than stretch the boundaries like they did with the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung has opted for the rather safe capacities of 3,000 mAh for the Galaxy S8 and 3,500 mAh for the Galaxy S8 Plus. This means the Galaxy S8 battery is the same size as the Galaxy S7, while the Galaxy S8 Plus is slightly smaller than the 3,600 mAh battery found inside the Galaxy S7 Edge.. The Galaxy S8 battery life has proven to be on par with most flagships, but not spectacular. Over the past two weeks, the Galaxy S8 battery life has proven to be on par with most flagships, but not spectacular. During an average 18-hour work day, the Galaxy S8 offered around 4Â. hours of screen-on-time for Josh, and on occasion, this stretched to five hours. In comparison, the battery life for me offered around 3.5 to 4 hours of screen on time from a 14- to 18-hour work day. TouchWiz gives you lots of different power saving features and combined with the Super AMOLED display, you can stretch out the battery life even further.. As mentioned before, our time with the Galaxy S8 Plus has been limited, so weâre not able to comment on the battery life yet. However, weâll be publishing the results of our battery testing for both phones in the coming week. From real world usage with the regular Galaxy S8, itâs clear that the battery life will vary according to your usage, but we seldom had to top the phone up before bedtime.. Samsung has refined its camera over the past few generations of its phones to produce what is arguably the all around best smartphone camera on the market. The Galaxy S8 camera may not be heavily changed from the Note 7, and evenÂ. the Galaxy S7 Edge before it, but enhancements in the overall picture taking experience mean Samsungâs legacy of high quality photography continues.. The big changes in the cameras come at the front, where Samsung has included an 8 MP shooter with a Smart Autofocus system. Autofocus is not something found too often on front-facing cameras and selfies benefit from the higher megapixel count, resulting in good photos in most lighting conditions. In low light, the pictures lose some sharpness as the shutter requires more time, but this is expected, especially from a camera that lacks image stabilization.. The main camera is a 12 MP shooter with large dual pixels, f/1.7 aperture, optical image stabilization, phase detection autofocus, and an LED flash. The interface is largely like before, prioritizing swipes and certain gestures to keep shooting simple and as easy to use in one-hand as possible. There are no new modes in the camera, though there is the addition of 1080p recording at 60 frames per seconds for smooth video recording. Video recording also sees the addition of manual controls in the Pro mode, including manual focus for finer control over the focus of your videos.. Samsung touts that the camera has multi-frame processing, which means it takes multiple shots of the same image and puts them together to get the best colors and detail from a scene. This aside, the experience and quality are almost identical to the Galaxy Note 7 and Galaxy S7, with images featuring high amounts of saturation and detail in all but the very darkest of conditions. The camera isnât the most accurate â Samsung devices never produce the most accurate photos â but the bump in saturation and detail mean the photos look more appealing to the eye compared to other phones.. The only real difference in the camera UI is the addition of a small eye icon in the bottom left of the viewfinder, which fires up the biggest addition to the camera, and the phone itself: Bixby.. Samsungâs take on the mobile assistant comes in the form of Bixby , which can be found throughout the phone in a lot of different ways. Bixby isnât the first time Samsung has attempted to offer a virtual assistant, after all the company did launch the infamous S Voice on the Galaxy S3. Despite much hype, it ended up being a poor imitation of Appleâs Siri â and more recently, Google Now â and S-Voice was heavily criticized, quickly forgotten, and slowly it got relegated to the status of one of the first apps you disable when you get your phone.. Samsung is hoping that Bixby doesnât suffer the same fate as S Voice. Samsung is hoping that Bixby doesnât suffer the same fate and seemingly recognized its weakness with S Voice through the acquisition of Viv, an AI platform that was developed by none other than the makers of Siri. Bixby does not include Viv technology right now, though that will likely change in future iterations.. Samsungâs assistant focuses on three key areas: Vision, Voice and Home.. Weâll start with Bixby Vision, which manifests itself in the camera through the little eye icon. Tapping this fires up Bixby Vision, which brings augmented reality to the camera in a bid to provide information in real time, based on the objects in the viewfinder. The premise of Vision is that itâs meant to be able to deliver reviews on restaurants, shopping links for items, and related images all in real time. While our initial demo looked impressive, Bixby Vision is in a very early stage.. For now, Bixby Vision does do a great job at looking up reviews of wine. Scanning a restaurant name brings up no related info, and scanning a simple water bottle doesnât bring up any shopping links. Samsung has teamed up with various apps and services to have a wider range of data and while most partnerships seem to be in early stages, Vision does do a great job at looking up reviews of wine. Samsung has partnered with Vivino to bring wine reviews, average selling price, and ratings directly to Vision, and it works as well as the regular Vivino app does.. On the left of the Galaxy S8, youâve got a dedicated shortcut button to launch Bixby Home, which aims to integrate various apps and services into a single screen in a similar way to Google Assistant. A new reminders app means you can set a reminder from within anÂ. application using the share menu and then it appears as a reminder within Bixby Home. While it works well enough overall, you do need to use all of Samsungâs apps that feed into it, rather than say, Googleâs native Android apps. For some users, this wonât be an issue but for others, a reliance on Samsungâs apps over others could be a deal breaker, especially as Googleâs own apps feed into Assistant which is also present on the Galaxy S8.. For now, Home is the most interesting part of Bixby, at least until Bixby Voice launches later in the year. Voice is expected to offer a lot of the conversational tone, that Google offers with its Assistant, but the biggest issue for Samsung is how long it will take for Bixby Voice to launch. We expected Bixby Voice to be available around the time of the Galaxy S8âs launch later this week, but instead, itâs likely to only be available in South Korea, with an US launch scheduled for later this spring.. Samsung has shown with Samsung Pay that itâs not the fastest at rolling features out to new markets, and with places like Germany not expected to get Bixby Voice until the end of the year , itâs likely that future devices will benefit more from Bixby Voice than the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus. Like with all assistants, Samsung will improve Bixby and it will get better with time, but right now, itâs lacking features that make it truly outstanding.. We wish the Bixby button could be customizable so you could launch other apps or services. That said, Samsung clearly recognizes that Bixby will take time to mature into the platform it has the potential to be and itâs likely that giving users the choice of Google Assistant is a way to mitigate this. Josh and I both like having a dedicated button to launch Bixby Home, rather than just a home screen, but we do wish it could be customizable so you could launch other apps or services, like Google Assistant, instead.Â. Just days ahead of the Galaxy S8’s launch, Samsung blocked an unofficial method for remapping the button to other features.. Bixby aside, the rest of the Galaxy S8 software is mostly identical to previous years with a little refinement for the various Galaxy S8 features that weâve already mentioned. The experience on the Galaxy S8 feels familiar, as Samsung has been working hard to give you their version of services that we already somewhat have.. Unlike previous years where a multitude of tutorials became the standard, the Galaxy S8 instead allows you to dive into the settings menu and learn everything the phone can do at your own pace. Samsungâs Nougat interface is one of the better-looking ones, and the plethora of features means thereâs an abundance of customization options. The Galaxy S8 proves that Samsung has tried to do everything at once, and while there may be some redundancy, the addition of so many features offers more customization than what’s found on most devices.. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus continue Samsung’s recent penchant of combining outstanding smartphone design with an excellent display to create an all-around fantastic experience. The switch to the taller display has allowed Samsung to cram even more screen real estate into its new smartphones and in doing so, the company is setting the new standard for big-screen devices. Think back to what a big screen phone meant a couple of years ago and compare it to the Galaxy S8 and it’s clear that the future is much brighter, and we’re now closer than ever to phone that is all display.. With the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge both proving to be excellent smartphones, Samsung sought to refine its smartphone experience further and achieved that, albeit with some trade-offs. The biggest of these is that a major selling feature – Bixby – is in its very early stages and, as a result, it’s not as useful as Samsung led us to believe. That said however, the Galaxy S8 is arguably the best phone for most users, but it might not be the best phone for users who want specific features.. For the all-around big-screen experience, Samsung has knocked it out of the park and while the likes of LG and Huawei definitely come close, the design of the Galaxy S8 means it stands tall above the competition.

High screen-to-body ratio (83.32 %). Very big display (6.2 inches). Extremely high pixel density screen (529 ppi). Lots of RAM (4 GB RAM). Large camera sensor pixel size (1.4 μm). As the name suggests, the Samsung Galaxy S8+ is a larger version of the Galaxy S8, equipped with an even bigger, 6.2-inch Infinity display stretching from edge to edge. The screen is also taller, allowing the phone to remain somewhat manageable in the hand despite the extra-large screen area. To make room for the taller screen, however, Samsung has replaced the physical buttons with on-screen ones, while the fingerprint scanner has been moved to the back. In terms of software and hardware, the Galaxy S8+ is nearly identical to the S8, powered by the fast and efficient Snapdragon 835 SoC. But the additional space has allowed Samsung to fit in a bigger, 3500mAh battery. And the camera is similar to the 12MP unit found on the Galaxy S7, but improved software processing allows it to create better photos by stitching together the best portions of multiple frames..

The single good thing i can say about this phone is it has an amazing camera. Definitely the best video and photos I've ever taken. Absolutely not worth purchasing unless you hate yourself and only want good photos that you can't even post anywhere because it will freeze and turn off. The worst phone I have ever owned. I usually buy those cheap phones that are like $100 with no contract and I guess I expected one that costs 8 times that with a contract to be better. Force closes every app I've tried to use. Tinder and Instagram will work less than a minute before it gets too much, over heats and freezes. Worst auto correct I've ever had of any phone, no matter how many times I reset it. Never recognizes my voice for voice to text, always opens up that stupid "Bixby Home" app (which also won't recognize my voice) even though I clicked that I wasn't interested in i. The screen instantly shattered with my first 2 foot drop of it in the first week, so I couldn't return it and am stuck in a contract with it. The person who made Swype work totally different on this phone is the bane of my entire existence. I have never had a phone that made me scream my head off in frustration every time I've ever tried to text or post a photo. I am 25 and have been using cellphones since before the Motorola V3 Razr came out so I'm not just some old lady who doesn't know what they're doing. I've tried numerous things to help clear up the issues with this phone - nothing has worked. I have owned this phone for a few months now and came from using the very similar, Nexus 5x, which I had none of these issues with and also had a good camera but not as great at this phone's..

If you do get one, have a very good phone case first. Mine smashed on day 1 & progressively got worse. And the price to replace the glass is extortionate. Is no good for gamers because of the screen. Keep catching buttons because of the curved screen. Who thought it was a good idea to put it where it is???? A royal pain in the bottom. Will never have another Samsung because of the S8.

I know the s8 has been out since April and I'm saying this kind of late, but it is the best phone on the market. The battery last me all day on a single charge after having it for several months. People say it's hard to reach the fingerprint sensor but I don't have any problem with it. I do have big hands so it is easier to reach the sensor. For me it has been incredibly durable. I like it better than any iPhone I have ever had. I miss the Apple App store. I like it better than Google play, but the s8 is overall the better phone. I know the new google pixel has a better camera and the iPhone X has... you know it's the iPhone X. I personally have not been impressed with iPhone X. The s8 is almost around $400 cheaper and I feel like it's a better phone. I personally feel like the only phone better than the s8 might be the Note 8..

This is the worst phone I've worked with since the 3. Voice to text has reverted back to non usable. The phone refuses to download more than one document or email at a time without restarting. Bixby is a non working answer to Apple or Google. Saving new contact cards is impossible. I got cracked and ordered one when they were first released.

I BOUGHT A SAMSUNG S8+ THRU VERIZON BECAUSE OF THE $250 GIFT CARD REBATE OFFER. UPLOADED A PHOTO OF THE RECEIPT ($970) USING VERIZON CHAT AND DURING THE QUALIFICATION PERIOD. 3 DAYS LATER I GET AN EMAIL "THEY CAN'T READ THE PHOTO". MAILED HARDCOPIES OF THE RECEIPT, THEN AN EMAIL "TOO LATE, OUTSIDE THE QUALIFICATION PERIOD". SAMSUNG, AND VERIZON, CANNOT BE TRUSTED..

I find that the Camera picture quality on the Samsung 8S and 8S Plus is very poor. If I had known that it was this bad, I wouldn't have upgraded my Galaxy Edge Plus to this phone. The Galaxy Edge Plus phone picture quality is excellent. In my opinion it more than exceeds the 8S and the 8S Plus picture quality. I took several pictures again last night and I had to delete all but one. That one still wasn't top quality, but I kept it anyway. You would think if you pay $800 for a phone, the camera on it would at least be decent. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com. Would Recommend to a friend.. I am giving a review for the Samsung Galaxy S8+. Posted on: November 28th, 2017 by zachjf2021. So I have had personal experience with S8+ and its very exceptional for what Samsung has done here. The screen is one of the best AMOLED screens out there compared to competitors and offers a very bright screen, rich details, the colors are spot on with it being a AMOLED. Secondly the battery life is well, its way better than an iphone thats for sure. On a daily use I could go about all day and have about a little over 30% by the time I set it on the charger, but overall battery life will surpass most iphone users or other users expectations on how long it can last. Now on to the camera, its very nice of samsung to make it to where at night S7 an S8 users have the upper hand when taking pictures because of a F1.7 aperture that allows all that light to come in which any day of the week blows any other phones out there right now out of the water. Quality of the shots are as expected on a galaxy to be pretty good for competition. Now for the last section, the performance is phenomenal when multi-tasking and its a breeze you dont need a A11 bionic chip to do what this Samsung can do. Gaming is pretty good too i enjoy playing the games that are fitted for the entire screen and hopefully in the future all games are converted for the S8 so that entire quad HD+ screen can be in use. Now the verdict here is, if you want a phone thats true quality and is bigger in screen, then this phone is for you. Sorry apple but you are know where close to what Samsung can do and will do, remember that. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com.

I should of stayed with my Samsung 6 edge. Phone has glitches out twice as a manufacturer default. Got my 3rd replacement $400 later low and behold had the 3rd replacement and had it 5 days and it already clutching and had to factory reset it. If the note 8 would of been out I would of rather had it or stuck with my 6 edge. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com. Would Not Recommend to a friend..

My grammar is poor as it's so hard to select higher case. this mobile is overmarketed and is worse I've ever had. I've smashed rear screen after can't select key's to express my frustration. I assume those techies raving are either stupid or not genuine Rodney Gardner. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com. Would Recommend to a friend.. Posted on: November 7th, 2017 by jlrichardsonjr. The S8 has some nice features but I was surprised at what it doesn't have. The first big thing I noticed is that it doesn't have is a "Do Not Disturb" mode that syncs with google calendar appointments and meetings. Nothing is more embarrassing than being that guy who's phone starts ringing in the middle of an important meeting or event. I had to use the "Tasker" app to set this up. My previous phone, a Moto X came with this feature out of the box over 2 years ago. All phone notifications were muted if you were marked as "Busy" on your calendar. I just assumed the Galaxy phones would have something similar to the Moto Assist functionality I had so enjoyed on the Motorolla. The S8 has no "driving mode" where it will read me a text when I'm driving and ask me if I would like to send a text in response all with my voice. These are a couple of functions my previous phone had that I used practically every day. Bixby is suppose to allow voice calling but it has been highly unreliable for me using voice commands. Thankfully the phone does come with Google assistant which works far better than the Samsung Bixby function. The Bixby button is frankly, just in the way. I should say a couple of good things about the phone I suppose. It has a great camera, the display is awesome and it has good storage capabilities. That was a big downside of the Moto X was storage. I've been hearing from happy Galaxy users for years about how awesome their phones are. I'm hoping it will grow on me.. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com.

Samsung Galaxy S8 Full Review, Pre Order, Specifications, Price and Release Date. Specs, Features, Price, and Release Date. The Samsung S8 is Finally Here!. Design: A marvelous piece of art – Samsung Galaxy S8. Display: The Magic of Infinity Display. Camera: Dual Pixel Technology, Multi-Frame Image Processing. Performance & Software: Will things change with Galaxy S8. Battery & Security: Welcome the Iris Scanner. Samsung Galaxy S8 Price & Release Date. March 29, 2017 By Richard Dunn. Everyone know 2016 was not a good year for Samsung, The company faced a lot of criticism and lost many users due to the fault in the battery of Note 7 Series. It was probably one of the biggest setbacks for Samsung due to which Samsung came to the backfoot in Android market. Getting the trust back was the most important task for Samsung and the company is trying to get it by their latest Samsung Galaxy S8. Short Overview Design: A marvelous piece of art – Samsung Galaxy S8 Display: The Magic of Infinity Display Camera: Dual Pixel Technology, Multi-Frame Image Processing Performance & Software: Will things change with Galaxy S8 Bixby: Samsung’s own ‘Google Now’ Battery & Security: Welcome the Iris Scanner Samsung Galaxy S8 Price & Release Date. – 5.8in / 6.2in QHD+ Super AMOLED curved display (570ppi / 529ppi). – Android 7.0 Nougat with Samsung Experience. – Fingerprint sensor (on rear) and iris scanner (on front). – Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chip (US), Exynos 9. – 4GB RAM (6GB in China and Korea). – 12MP main camera / 8MP front-facing camera. – Bixby AI assistant with dedicated button. – 64GB storage with microSD (up to 256GB). – Optional Samsung DeX HDMI dock for desktop mode. Black Sky, Orchid Grey and Arctic Silver colour options.. We have come so far in the smartphone industry, that almost all the phones look similar. The same old flat display with finger print scanner on either back or front. Apple tried to change the concept when it ditched the audio jack but that too was not liked by the users.. Just when we thought that Smartphone companies are done with innovation and nothing better can come, Samsung came up with Galaxy S8. We can bet on the fact that you will get in love with the looks of S8 at the very first sight. Samsung Galaxy S8 has got the great looks and it seems strong on paper. So, question is, whether Samsung Galaxy S8 is worth the hype of being the best smartphone in the market. Let’s see in our in-depth review of Samsung Galaxy S8 .. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Samsung Galaxy S8 is not a phone but a piece of art. It seems like Samsung decided to make something new without compromising on anything. Galaxy S8 is a perfect example of how you can use Glass to make a smartphone. It features Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on both the sides which also makes it bit delicate. Hold the phone for few minute and you will have a strange fear in your heart that what if you drop the phone .. Samsung Galaxy S8 Price, Release Date. No doubt, it is Gorillas glass but, glass is glass. There are no buttons on the front side of the display thus making it all screen display. The finger print scanner has been moved to the back side of the phone. Now, this is the area of debate. Samsung has found a unique position to place the finger print scanner.. Unlike most of the smartphone, it is not in the centre but it sits just adjacent to the camera at the top.. Since S8 is a tall phone with 5.8” display it becomes very difficult to locate the finger print sensor. You will either end up scanning your finger on Camera Lens or you will partially cover the sensor. What is the logic behind this placement can only be justified by Samsung but, it will take you some time to get used to it. So, if you ask us to describe the design of phone in one word, it would be ‘ Wow ’.. Samsung played a big gamble when it launched Galaxy Note Edge in 2014. Users around the world welcomed the new concept of a curved display but it had its own pros and cons. On the positive side, it looked beautiful & futuristic it had one major problem. The curved display used to show issues while using when your hand accidentally touches the curved display. Samsung has been working on perfecting the curved display and the result is ‘Infinity Display’.. Samsung Galaxy S8 – Pros & Cons. Thanks to Infinity Display, it doesn’t look like you are holding a phone but rather it seems like you are just holding a display since the display melts over both side. This curved display on both the side also offers a better viewing angles and makes a phone look slimmer and classic.. Most of the time users which to have a bigger display but they are just not ready to have a bigger phone or phablet in that case. The need of the hour was to have a bigger display without increasing the size of the device. Now, the point is how would you do it.. Samsung got the answer to this and that is why Samsung dumped the concept of 16:9 screen ratio and has come up with 18:9 ratio which means a bigger display in a smaller body.. Samsung Galaxy S8 boasts of beautiful 5.8” AMOLED display with a pixel ratio of 2960 x 1440 pixels. Let us tell you one more time that it is a tall phone. While Samsung may claim that you can easily use it with one hand, we disagree it. We are not asking you to trust us here, you can decide this on your own.. Samsung has also brought the concept of ‘Mobile HDR Premium’ where the display offers better color, darker blacks & brighter whites. There is also a video enhancer mode where it boosts the contrast & brightness. This mode can be used for watching content on YouTube & Netflix. You will get a 1080p display by default which can be changed to QHD by tweaking the settings.. While everything is perfect there is one small downside to this new 18:9 screen ratio. Most of the content on Internet, Videos, apps are designed for devices with a ratio of 16:9. If you look closely if you are watching a 16:9 content on Galaxy S8, you will see Black Bars fill up the extra space. Though you can change this to 18:9 but it affects the quality. While 18:9 content looks amazing, you will have to wait for apps and content to become more friendly for devices having 18:9 screen ratio.. Samsung knew that Galaxy S7 camera was the best in class so they didn’t experiment a lot with Camera of S8. Samsung Galaxy S8 sports the same camera as of S7 with little tweaks. Samsung could have included Dual Sensor or Wide Angle Lens like LG G6 but it seems like Samsung didn’t want to take that risk.. Coming back to a camera, there is a 12 MP camera at rear with a focal length of f/1.7 & Optical Image Stabilization. It used the ‘Dual Pixel’ technology which results in ultra-fast autofocus. Camera Quality was never a question in the case of Samsung Galaxy S series and S8 carries the legacy. Samsung has also introduced a new feature by the name of ‘Multi-Frame Image Processing’ where it clicks three images at a time and stitched these three to yield the best image. You just need to double tap the power key and it will fire up the camera.. There is also a ‘Pro Mode’ where you can play with ISO and white balance and can entertain your inner photographer. There is no such over-saturation of color, excess contrast issue with the camera and clicks just perfect images. The lens has also been widened a bit which allows extra light to pass the lens thus snapping clear photos even in low light.. S8 sports an 8 MP front camera which can click selfies to die for. The reason behind this is Auto Focus. There are still the only handful of phones present in the market which features auto focus in front camera and Samsung Galaxy S8 is one of them. The device also offers few filters like Snapchat to play with. We can confidently say that Samsung Galaxy S8’s camera is capable of giving tough competition to likes of Google Pixel and LG G6. (We believe it is best but who is better to decide apart from you). No one has ever been a fan of Samsung’s Software. While performance is not an issue being it a flagship device, but Samsung has always been criticized for its Software.. Talking about performance, the Europe & Asia version is powered by Exynos 8895 SoC along with Mali G71 GPU while the USA version will have the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC along with Adreno 540 GPU. It is supported by a 4 GB of RAM which is enough for the device.. Being powered by the latest chipset, performance is not a doubt in S8. It works perfectly fine no matter how heavy game you are playing or how much multitasking you are doing. You can easily switch from one app to another without any noticeable lag. It offers 64 GB of internal storage & supports up to 256 GB of external storage via MicroSD card.. It comes with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box with Samsung Skin on the top. Icons look much better with angular & edgy design. The color scheme of the device is crisp & clear & the device UI looks fresh and smooth. The S8 comes with a new software feature called ‘DeX’ which is like ‘Microsoft Continuum’. With DeX you need an HDMI supported to monitor and you can convert use Samsung Galaxy S8 into Mini Computer.. One of the biggest change in software is the introduction of Bixby which is Samsung’s new artificial intelligence assistant. In a most simple word, it is just like Google Now with a different name & few different features. Samsung is so confident of Bixby that they have added a dedicated button for it just underneath the Volume Controls.. Just press the button and it will activate the voice assistant. The Voice Control Feature is not fully ready yet and is available only in few selected regions and US/UK are not a part of that region.. Bixby can also be accessed by swiping from left just like Google Now and it will show you things like calendar apps, reminders etc. One of the best parts about Bixby is when it works with the camera.. When you click a photo with Bixby Camera, it used the artificial intelligence to recognize the clicked image and show you options like where you can buy it. Try clicking a pack of Doritos and it will redirect you to Amazon to buy one.. Though Galaxy S8 is not the first phone to come up with Iris Scanner but it has improved it a lot. The most common notion with Iris Scanner is that you need to place your phone straight to your eyes to unlock the device.. However, the Iris Scanner in S8 is smart enough to detect eyes even when it is not in straight contact. So, no more awkward positions while unlocking the phone via Iris Scanner. Of course, there is Face Scanner but it can be unlocked with a photograph so you can’t trust it much. Samsung Pay is also a nice feature and can be handy while shopping.. Samsung Galaxy S8 is also the first device to use Bluetooth 5.0 which means you can connect it to two Bluetooth speakers at a same time and can play music on both. It is powered by a 3000 mAh of a battery which delivers decent result & can easily last a day. Wireless charging is still there along with USB Type C. Samsung Galaxy S8 is both water & dust resistance. Unlike Apple, Samsung has till kept the headphone jack and good part is you get AKG earphones along with the phone in the box.. Both Samsung Galaxy S8 & Galaxy S8+ are available in three colors which are Midnight Black, Coral Blue & Maple Gold.The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are both available to pre-order from Wednesday 29th March, with early buyers set to receive their handset on 20 April.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 Edge will bring back the curved appeal with many changes expected that will help distinguish it as one of the most functional smartphone concepts we’ve seen so far.

Samsung Galaxy S8 Rumors Samsung Galaxy S8 Specs Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Samsung Galaxy S8 Concept Samsung Galaxy S8 Price Samsung Galaxy S8 Preorders Samsung Galaxy S8 Release Date. Despite the fact the new Galaxy S8 won’t debut until the 2 nd quarter of 2017, this doesn’t mean there isn’t much to tell. We are privy to all the latest and great Samsung Galaxy S8 rumors including the many changes expected with both the standard S8 and the S8 Edge. Sammy is believed to be producing more of the Edge variant as it has quickly become one of the hottest smartphone concepts on the market.. Expect to see a faster processor, more durable glass surround, better features, comparable price, and more functionality with peripherals. With rumors on a 4K display , eye sensing technology , enhanced Android Pay interface, Foldable dual screen and a better functionality between phone and auto.. There were early rumors that Sammy was looking to launch both the S8 and S8 Edge slightly earlier than usual, but this is highly unlikely. Expect the official unveiling at the 2017 MWC event which is likely to set up a launch worldwide starting at the beginning of April. Production is rumored to start earlier than usual which would mean more handsets available on the day of launch. We’re hoping this to hold true as consumer interest for both versions is at an all-time high which could mean long launch delays, especially in smaller markets.. There have been rumours that Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 edge will be first smartphone of the world which support 5G connectivity. available in any country of the world. But in upcoming years some countries of the world lke as The United States and South Korea are planning to launch 5G service. So it will be benefical for people who have Samsung Galaxy S8 or S8 edge. So please wait for the official. The many rumors already in circulation are some of the reasons why many are calling the upcoming Samsung flagships two of the best 2017 smartphones.. We’ve been hearing a lot on the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 specs , although nothing has yet to be confirmed. Some of the biggest enhancements in the specs for both include at least 30 megapixels seen in the rear camera , dual micro SD card slots , enhanced body metric sensors, and much more. The latest word on the specs to come are all detailed below:. The new Samsung Galaxy S8 features will center on increasing security while improving speed, productivity, and making both the S8 and S8 Edge more functional. We’ve been hearing about eye sensing technology for quite some time, and it seems that Sammy will be improving the eye scanner that we’ll be seeing in the Galaxy S7. The retina eye scanner in both S8 models will be more responsive and take less time to register.. One of the best additions will be a new, unique glass-like surround. We’re hearing rumors of a much more durable surround that will hold-up much better than the current model. We were hoping to see a waterproof surround that we’ve seen in the rugged Active models, but this isn’t likely based on what we’ve hearing as of now.. Samsung is ready to launch their new smartphone Samsung Galaxy s8. We all Samsung is world famous for making flagship smartphone,So that’s why people are crazy for. Galaxy S8 will have numbers of latest features like as dual camera, Water resistant and much more.. Android Auto is expected to become a standard features in many upcoming cars and trucks which would give consumers the ability to access music playlists, apps, and other features from your phone directly on your car or truck display. Android Pay is also starting to take-off along with Samsung Pay which gives consumers sporting an upcoming Android smartphone the ability to conveniently and safely checkout at many worldwide retailers.. Sammy has been listening to what consumers are asking for, and everything noted will be seen in the upcoming Galaxy S8 concept. The speed will rival that of any new 2017 smartphone, and all other facets will be getting a bump including more camera features , improved visual display, increased security features, and a better interface with Samsung and 3 rd party apps.. Expect to see more marketing with mobile payment options including Samsung and Android Pay. Apple pioneered mobile payment technology with Apple Pay, but both Samsung and Google are making huge strides and this will be seen once again with the newest flagships.. The durable glass-like surround and the new Corning Gorilla glass will significantly improve both the durability of the screen and outer surround. Expect to see a new, premium glass outer body that will encase both the front and back of both S8 versions.. Samsung hasn’t become known as one of the industries leaders with believing in the idea of maintaining the status quo which leads us into one of the latest rumors on the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8. They’ve already confirmed that a foldable smartphone is in the works, and could be launched as early as 2017 or 2018. This leads us into one of the latest rumors on the new Samsung Galaxy S8 concept that just may feature a true foldable design.. Consumers will be happy to know that the price of Samsung Galaxy S8 will be competitive for smartphone lovers. Samsung confirm that the price of Samsung Galaxy S8 & S8 edge will slightly high than Galaxy S7 &S7 edge. So it is a good news for people which are waiting for galaxy S8 & Galaxy S8 edge.. As we all know Samsung always provide numbers of new features to their customers in latest smartphones and now Samsung is world famous for making quality smartphones. However the price of their phones are very high but people can easily trust on it.. Release date prices will be available through full purchase, carrier two year contracts, and installment pricing which will vary by carrier. We have come to expect new and renewal two year contract pricing through most of the top carriers worldwide, but many including those here in the US are moving away from contracts in-place of installment plans.. T-Mobile was the first of the big four to do so, and Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint will all be following suit in the coming years. This bodes well for consumers as the initial contract price of the GS8 could be as high as $299 with the premium S8 Edge being as high as $349. Installment prices such as AT&T’s Next would call for no money down, and a monthly price for a period of 24 months around $35/month.. We’ll update you on the official launch prices specific to carriers worldwide as soon as we get it. The latest rumors on what to expect worldwide can be seen in the table below which is broken down by the release date price for many markets worldwide.. Those who take advantage of preorders will likely get their new handsets delivered to them a day or two before the worldwide launch from all of the top retailers including Vodafone, Sprint, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and many others. All of the top carriers worldwide will be starting taking Samsung Galaxy S8 preorders about two weeks before the actual launch, and those who are looking to secure a handset first may want to consider this.. Those who preorder either the GS8 or GS8 Edge will have the best chance of securing a handset on the day of launch, and considering the enormous consumer interest there’s likely to be significant launch delays. The Galaxy S series has become one of the top smartphone models of all-time, and one of the most consistent in recent years. Preorders, whether online or in-store will also allow some in larger markets to get their hands on their new phone up to a couple of days before those who elect to purchase on the date of launch.. For those in the US, all of the top five carriers will be taking preorders including Sprint, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and US Cellular. We’ll update you with the official preorder date for all of the top carriers as soon as we get it. There are also early rumors that Verizon and AT&T will be the first to open their doors, and there are early reports that some retailers such as Best Buy will be offering freebies for those who order early.. Samsung is likely to stick with the same annual release date for both of their upcoming flagships in 2017 including both the GS8 and GS8 Edge. Both will be launched globally on the same day with those in Asia getting being the luckiest to see them first. The latest Samsung Galaxy S8 release date rumors suggest those in South Korea, China, Japan, and Taiwan will likely see both become available for consumer purchase at the beginning of April. Those in Europe and here in the US will have to wait just a bit longer as the 2 nd to 3 rd week in April 2017 seems to be the most likely.. There are some new rumors that Samsung may even be looking to push up the release date to mid-March with an official announcement that may come as early as early March during the annual MWC event. It’s almost certain that both will debut at the Mobile World Congress 2017, and as Samsung looks to get both flagships out before other upcoming smartphones in 2017 a mid-March release is possible.. We are also waiting for the official statement of samsung about their upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8.. We’ll update you on the official announcement as soon as we get it. For now, check out the expected release date for both the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Edge by country in the table below.. Still with over a year to go until we hear anything official on Samsung’s next flagship in 2017, we’re hearing a lot of what’s expected in both the GS8 and GS8 Edge. The Edge concept is expected to become bigger than ever as the popularity of the unique flagship is peaking consumer interest to an all-time high. With both expected to be bigger, more functional, and interface with other peripherals will only make Samsung’s S series flagship even more popular.. With huge expectations with other 2017 smartphones from Apple, LG, HTC, Sony, and others, it’ll be interesting to see if Samsung is able to live up to the high expectations that analysts and consumers already have. With 4K technology and cameras that are likely to top 30 megapixels, it’s easy to see why so many are holding out for the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Edge..
