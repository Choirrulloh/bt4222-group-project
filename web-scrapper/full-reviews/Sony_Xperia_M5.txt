Sony’s mobile division is in a strange place right now. It’s killed off the Z series and launched the Xperia X and Xperia XA without altering the design formula it’s used for years.. Now, the Japanese brand’s flagship phones have come in for a bit of flak from us, but I’ve always liked its more budget and mid-range phones oriented.. Last year’s Xperia M4 Aqua was great and the Xperia M5 once again offers great bang for the buck, especially if you’re after a water-resistant phone.. Watch – Trusted Explains: Buying a new smartphone. Either Sony really, and I mean really , loves its ‘omnibalance’ phone design, or it simply doesn’t have the designers available to make anything different. On first glance, the Xperia M5 looks just like any other Sony smartphone released in the last three years.. Related: Best smartphones in 2016. The front and back are flat, while the sides are rounded with prominent corners. Unlike the pricier Xperias, the M5 is mostly constructed from plastic, which means it feels less fancy than its SIM-free price suggests.. There’s no fingerprint scanning button on the side like on the Z5, replaced by the more familiar circular lock switch. Below that is the volume rocker, and further down is the camera shutter button. I still appreciate a physical button for the camera – it makes jumping to it from anywhere easy and quick – but they’re a bit mushy and hard to press.. The opposite side features a cover that when popped off reveals the SIM card slot and tray for a microSD card. It’s quite tricky prizing out the inner trays, but it’s hopefully something you won’t be doing all that often.. It’s compact, perfect for one-handed use and as long as you don’t plump for the awfully gaudy and downright ugly gold option I’m using for review you’ll bag yourself a nice looking phone. Yet, Sony needs to stop resting on its laurels and do something a bit different with its design eventually.. One of the biggest selling points for the Xperia M5 is that it’s waterproof. This feature is nothing new for the Xperia series, in fact it’s been one of the mainstays since the Xperia Z hit, but it’s still nice to see it sticking around. The Xperia M5 holds an IP65/68 rating, which means that it can withstand light water jets as well as full immersion, and is thus more water resistant than the Samsung Galaxy S7 and its IP68 rating..

At 5-inches, the Xperia M5 is fairly typical and some might deem it a ‘smaller’ phone these days. It still packs a 1080p resolution though, which combined with a smaller size makes for a very sharp display.. I loved the screens on the Xperia Z5 and while the 4K gimmick on the Xperia Z5 Premium was an absolute joke, it still had a lovely 1080p panel. Thankfully, the M5 retains this quality as it once again has a fantastic screen. Aside from the fact it’s an absolute fingerprint magnet, the LCD display is vivid with accurate colours. Viewing angles could be better though as there’s an obvious loss of contrast when you tilt the device to the side.. For me, 5-inches is too small to use this as a media device – even though films look great, with deep blacks – but it’s ideal for bouts of mobile gaming.. By modern standards the bezel above and below the screen is very large, especially given there’s no physical home button. I’d rather see something like the Xperia XA, which almost eliminates the bezels and improves the look no end, but it’s not a huge problem.. Even on full whack, it lacks any real punch and it pales in comparison to even cheaper phones like the BQ Aquaris X5 .. Next Performance, software and battery life.

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $259 Buy. $224 Buy.

The Sony Xperia M5 has a gorgeous screen and is a competent phone in every other way, but its a small, expensive upgrade on the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua.. Sony Xperia M5 price and release date Launched at a higher price than the Xperia M4 Aqua did Now down to $240 (£250, about AU$420) Design Traditional Sony Omnibalance design Falls in between Xperia M4 Aqua and Xperia Z5 Key features 5-inch Full HD screen that offers better resolution than past phones 21.2MP rear shooter and 13MP front facing camera. The Sony Xperia M5 is a follow-up to the middling Sony Xperia M4 Aqua , which on paper seems to fix many of the issues we had with that mid-range phone.. There's more storage, more RAM, a higher-spec camera and a sharper screen. With an octa-core processor, 3GB of RAM, 1080p screen, water-resistant build, 21.2MP main camera and a 13MP front-facing one, the Xperia M5 certainly ticks a lot of boxes.. But is it the phone the M4 Aqua should have been, or does the higher price put it out of the mid-range running?. Sony decided to raise the price of the Xperia M5 compared to the Xperia M4. The Sony Xperia M5 launched at $370 (£300, AU$425), while the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua can was around $340 (£220, AU$435).. You can now get a good discount on the Xperia M5 with it coming in at around $240 (£250, about AU$420).. The Sony Xperia M5 certainly makes a good first impression. Like so many Sony phones it has a rectangular Omnibalance design, and in terms of the materials used it falls somewhere between the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua and the Sony Xperia Z5 .. The M4 Aqua is all polycarbonate, whereas here the back has been upgraded to a glass finish. But where the Xperia Z5 has a metal frame it's plastic on the Xperia M5, other than the corners, which are made of stainless steel.. Its dimensions are similar to those of the M4 Aqua, with the M5 coming in at 145 x 72 x 7.6mm. It's a slim phone then, but it's not actually all that compact given its 5-inch display; it's only slightly smaller than the Moto X Play , despite that phone having a much larger 5.5-inch screen.. The big bezels above and below the display on the Xperia M5 are the culprit here. While they presumably serve some purpose under the hood they look unnecessarily large, with only the microphone and earpiece, a Sony logo and a 13MP camera lens visibly housed in them – other than that they're just empty black space.. Weight : 142g Dimensions : 145 x 72 x 7.6mm OS : Android 6.0.1 Screen size : 5-inch Resolution : 1080 x 1920 CPU : Mediatek Helio X10 RAM : 3GB Storage : 16GB Battery : 2600mAh Rear camera : 21.2MP Front camera : 13MP. Even the bezels to the sides of the screen look a little on the large side, but that's a small complaint. The Xperia M5 is a slim and generally stylish handset, which – until you actually get your hands on it and feel the plastic edging – appears almost as premium as the Xperia Z5.. It's a little plain, with the whole body coming in one colour (gold in the case of my review unit). And there's little to break that finish up on the back, with just a couple of small logos, a 21.2MP camera lens and an LED flash.. But being plain isn't the worst thing in the world, and Sony's iconic metal power key does add a touch of contrast on the right edge. The button is positioned halfway down, which makes it easy to reach.. Note, though, that unlike on some Sony handsets there's no fingerprint scanner here, which is a shame.. That right edge is also home to a volume rocker and dedicated camera shutter button, both of which are even closer to the bottom edge, making them just as easy to get to without stretching.. Speaking of the bottom edge, that houses a micro USB port and the M5's speaker; sadly, there's no stereo sound here. On the left edge you'll find covered slots for the SIM card and microSD card, while up top there's a headphone port.. So all the actual buttons are on one edge, which makes them easy to find, especially as they're all different sizes and shapes.. The slightly curved edges make the Sony Xperia M5 reasonably comfortable to hold too, and while they're a little slippery the glass back provides a lot more grip.. All in all it's a fairly good-looking and very easy to operate phone, and I haven't even got to one of its best features yet: the fact that it's IP68-certified dust-proof and water-resistant.. While I'd always be hesitant to risk my phone in a shower or swimming pool, it does at least give me some peace of mind that if I spill a drink on it or get caught in the rain it will still work afterwards.. Of course you can get this same protection with the far cheaper Xperia M4 Aqua, but it's nice to see nonetheless.. While the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua has waterproofing as a key feature it's more of an expectation here, which is presumably why Sony has dropped 'Aqua' from the name.. The Sony Xperia M5 is, on paper at least, an improvement on the Xperia M4 Aqua in almost every other way, with the screen and camera arguably being the two biggest improvements.. The display is still 5 inches, but it has a resolution of 1080 x 1920, up from 720 x 1280 on the Xperia M4 Aqua. That resolution jump gives it a pixel density of 441 pixels per inch. That's up from just 294ppi on the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua, and puts the M5 more in line with the Sony Xperia Z5 and HTC One M9 .. The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua had a vibrant display with great viewing angles, and the same is true on the M5 – but now it's sharper. The contrast is good, images are still fairly bright even at extreme angles, and everything looks great on it.. There are better screens, and sharper ones. A quick look at what Samsung is doing on the Galaxy S7 – or even the Samsung Galaxy S6 – will show you that, but at this sort of price the Sony Xperia M5 stands up really well.. The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua has a solid but sluggish 13MP main snapper and a 5MP front-facing camera; the Xperia M5 significantly ups the megapixel count to 21.2MP on the back and 13MP on the front.. I'll cover the cameras in detail in the camera section, but for now you just need to know that it's an upgrade in some ways and not in others.. It's not much faster at snapping photos, despite the extra gigabyte of RAM the phone is packing, but shots are generally pretty impressive, as well as giving you lots of options to play with if you don't want to just point and shoot.. Not only are both the M5's camera and screen upgrades over the M4 Aqua's, they also stand up well to many rival phones at this price point. The 13MP primary snapper on the OnePlus 2 is no match for the M5's, for example, and its 1080p screen is no better.. Things become a bit more muddied when you consider that you can get some of 2015's flagships for only a shade more than this. The LG G4 , for example, can be found for around the same price and both the camera and screen blow the M5's away.. That's a big problem for the Xperia M5, as while it shouldn't be expected to compete with a flagship – even a 2015 one – its price means it has to do exactly that..

While Sony’s Android UI was once heavy, re-skinning the majority of Google OS, it’s now much lighter.. Yes, there are a few visual tweaks – the app drawer features a transparent background and a couple of the default apps are Sony’s, rather than Google’s – but it’s by no means an eyesore.. But even six months after its arrival, Sony has yet to update its fleet of devices to Android Marshmallow. That means the Sony Xperia M5 is still running Android 5.1 Lollipop. To my mind, it’s unacceptable for a brand new phone to launch with an old version of the operating system, especially when updated take so long to arrive.. Sony has also added a lot, and I mean a lot , of its own apps to the Xperia M5. You’ve got its three preloaded media apps, three separate ones for PlayStation, the Xperia Lounge (this is basically a useless place for lots of adverts) OfficeSuite, AVG protection, Kobo Books and more that I won’t bore you with here. A few of them you can uninstall, but it’s still a pain that they’re there at all in the first place.. Instead of choosing a mid-range processor from Snapdragon, Sony has plumped for a Mediatek Helio X10 CPU. This 64-bit octa-core chip might not be a household name like its more illustrious competition, but don’t let that put you off – it’s a fine performer here. There’s 3GB RAM too, something you don’t always see at this price.. I’d even go as far as saying the Xperia M5 is a better performer than the Snapdragon 810 toting Z5 , simply because it doesn’t fall foul to some of the bugs I ran into when using that phone. General performance is fantastic – there’s almost no lag browsing Chrome, sending emails and opening up the camera (something that really let the Z5 down) and a tough workload of apps with ease.. The majority of games I play on a regular basis (Monument Valley, Threes, Lara Croft Go, Ski Safari 2) are all free of dropped frames and play perfectly fine. Hitman Sniper, a game I would still say is one of the most demanding available on Google Play, performs less impressively, but it’s still playable.. Running the multi-core test on Geekbench 3, the Xperia M5 picks up a score of 3,862. That puts it ahead of the LG G4 (3,260) and the Nexus 5X (3,543), both of which are much pricier than the Sony. On AnTuTu it scores 52,347, again beating out much higher-end devices like Blackberry’s Priv and HTC’s One A9 .. There’s 16GB of internal storage which can be upped through a microSD card, though as this isn’t running Android 6.0 you won’t be able to use adoptable storage..

Even with the stamina mode turned on – which makes the phone feel noticeably sluggish – the most I’ve managed is about a day and a half.. Without the battery saving mode on, I can easily go a day without hitting the red. A normal day of usage typically leaves me with between 15-20% left by about midnight, which drops to 8-10% if I leave it uncharged overnight.. There’s also quite a big drop in battery when I stream Netflix. A 40-minute HD episodes eats through about 12%, while a film can take as much as 25%. It’s a similar story with gaming – a 30-minute bout of Monument Valley takes the battery down 10%.. A full charge take just over an hour, which is about what I would expect from a phone with a 2,600 mAh battery, but there’s no wireless support.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

Sony Xperia M5 vs Sony Xperia M4 Aqua: What’s the difference?. Home > Phones >. Phone buyer's guides > Sony Mobile phone buyer's guides. The Xperia M4 Aqua is slimmer and lighter The Xperia M5 has a sharper, crisper display The Xperia M5 improves both the front and rear cameras The Xperia M5 should be faster and last longer Similar software experience Conclusion. Sony is well known for launching several smartphones a year. It doesn't stick to the annual refresh cycle that many of its competitors do, instead it opts for more of a bi-annual cycle with both its flagship and mid-range series of devices.. The latest smartphone to join the Sony Mobile portfolio is the successor to the Xperia M4 Aqua that was announced at Mobile World Congress at the beginning of March.. Just five months on we have been greeted with the Xperia Z5, dropping the Aqua name but keeping the waterproofing. We have crunched the numbers and compared the specs to see how things have changed and what the differences are between the Xperia M4 Aqua and the Xperia M5.. The Xperia M5 is only just smaller than the Xperia M4 Aqua, but it is both thicker and heavier. The new device measures 145 x 72 x 7.6mm and the dual-SIM model hits the scales at 142.6g.. Its predecessor measures 145.5 x 72.6 x 7.3mm and weighs just 136g so there isn't much in it in terms of size, but the new model adds a couple of grams to the weight.. The M5 will be available in black, white and gold, while the M4 Aqua is available in black, white and coral.. We loved the design of the Xperia M4 Aqua and the Xperia Z5 appears to follow a similar look, replicating the flagship Z series. Both the M4 Aqua and the M5 are IP65 and IP68 rated and both feature capless Micro-USB ports.. The Xperia M4 Aqua and the Xperia M5 both feature 5-inch displays but the Xperia M5 has increased the resolution.. The M4 Aqua features a 1280 x 720 resolution display, which delivers a pixel density of 294ppi. The Xperia M5 increases this to Full HD 1920 x 1080, which means more pixels per inch at 440ppi. This should offer sharper, crisper images.. The display on the M4 Aqua was sufficient. It didn't offer a great deal of vibrancy with its colours and whites were a little dim. There was also some fuzz on the top bar where the battery and time are displayed, but we suspect the bump in resolution will help improve the screen experience.. The main difference in these two devices is the cameras. The Xperia M4 Aqua features a 13-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front snapper but the Xperia M5 jumps these up to 21.5-megapixels and 13-megapixels, respectively.. The new device will be capable of 4K video recording from the rear snapper, while the M4 Aqua could only handle 1080p. The front camera on the M5 will be able to record 1080p video, while the front camera on the M4 Aqua was only 720p so there has been an improvement here too. Additionally, Sony has introduced 5x clear image zoom on the M5, taking over from the 4x digital zoom of the M4 Aqua and you'll also get Hybrid AF on the new device.. Video stabilisation and image stabilisation are on board both devices, but the M5 will also offer auto scene recognition whereas the M4 Aqua did not. The camera on the M4 Aqua was one of its biggest downfalls so we'd hope for a big improvement with the M5.. The Xperia M5 has an octa-core 64-bit processor under its hood, but it moves from Qualcomm to MediaTek and ups the speed from 1.5GHz found within the M4 Aqua to 2GHz. There is also an increase in RAM from 2GB to 3GB, which should mean the new device will be more capable of handling harder tasks.. In terms of storage, the M5 will come with 16GB internal memory, which means Sony has chosen to ditch the option of an 8GB model, which users could get with the M4 Aqua. Both come with microSD support for storage expansion up to 200GB so there isn't much change in terms of storage.. The battery capacity has seen a slight increase with the new model however, jumping up fro 2400mAh to 2600mAh, but with the display resolution jump, we suspect the running time will be around the same, with perhaps a slight improvement on the M5.. The Sony Xperia M4 Aqua and Xperia M5 both run on Android Lollipop with Sony's overlay on top.. This means you'll get a very similar software experience with both but as these are both mid-range devices, you won't get features such as PS4 Remote Play, as you do with Sony's flagship Z series.. Sony's Walkman and entertainment apps will be on board though, along with the Xperia Lounge app. You'd notice a slight difference between the M series and the Z series, but not between the two M series devices.. The Sony Xperia M5 makes improvements in most areas over the Xperia M4 Aqua, as you would expect from a succeeding device.. It may be a fraction of a millimetre thicker and a few grams heavier, but the M5 offers a sharper display, bigger battery capacity, faster processor and the potential for big camera improvements.. Pricing details haven't been announced yet but if Sony makes the Xperia M5 around the £200 mark like the Xperia M4 Aqua, it might even have the new Moto G shaking in its boots..

El celular despues de 2 meses de uso presenta problemas en la pantalla, se le va a el color y aparecen unas lineas extrañas.. Tengo un M5 Sony, y después de un par de 2 años, hace 2 días por cuestiones de trabajo lo apague casi toda la jornada (10 hr) y al encender, la pantalla no reaccionaba, solo los botones laterales encendido, volumen y la cámara, pero por lo mismo no podio presionar reinicio, apagar, o tomar foto porque no permitía ni una pulsación, aclaró que no estaba bloqueado ya que al presionar la cámara, esta se accionaba podía tomar fotos y realizar zoom o las mismas fotos pero todo con las laterales, como pude lo reinicie, lo apague, lo deje descansar, desinstale las últimas aplicaciones (porque en ratos opera "normal") y vuelve a lo mismo, aclaró: no se cayó, no se mojo...solo eso estuvo en mi pantalón apagado. Alguien me puede ayudar? (ahorita escribo porque es intermitente, solo por momentos lo agarro y sirve, pero no se si por "moverlo" vuelve a dejar de reaccionar.... Me compre el m5 hace 3 días. Y no tiene ningún problema, lo compre en oferta, al final pague menos que las terminales como Samsung j7 y otros modelos de LG y moto. La batería no dura, pero es de menos ya que solo lo uso en mi casa. Y el celular es vidrio y plástico. Es un buen celular, la memoria interna no se llena etc. Me gusta poder cambiar de tema, igual que los Nokia asha. mi xperia m5 cuando lo desbloqueo no reacciona la pantalla tactil, teno que presionar el boton de la camara ,bloquearlo y despues desbloquearlo con el boton de power y asi ya funciona normal. pero al apagarse la pantalla vuelve el problema lo tengo hace 18 meses y hasta ahora falla. tengo un M5 le compre en mayo de este año en septiembre las me dejo de funcionar el parlante del auricular lo lleve al servicio tecnico me lo tuvieron 30 dias al devolvermelo eso funcionaba bien me lo traje al llegar a mi csa lo empiezo a usar y cuando quiero usar la camara no funcionaba me decia LA FUNCION CAMARA SE DETUVO,intente las mil formas y no volvio a funcionar. Lo apage y le deje cargando bien para probarlo al intentar prenderlo me llevo la sorpresa que el equipo tenia una demora muuuuy larga en prender lo hice varias veces y siempre demoraba hasta la tome el tiempo y tenia una demora de 9 minutos en encende,queria saber si alguien le ocurrio algunos de esos problemos. Solo espero que no tengan repuestos para que me den otro equipo nuevo,gracias y disculpen todo lo que escribi.. TENGO UN SONY XPERIA M5 AQUA HACE POCO MÁS DEL AÑO Y EMPEZO UN PROBLEMA EN MI PANTALLA COMO UNA MANCAH GRIS EN LA TERCERA PARTE DE LA PANTALLA COMO QUE SE DISTORCIONA Y LUEGO REGRESA BIEN, ES COMO SI TUVIERA UN VIRUS, YA LO RESTAURE Y EL PROBLEMA SIGUE. Mi soy m5 no me deja prender el wifi y el bluetooth me oueden ayuder como le hago si se necesuta reparar me urge mucho porfa. Tengo m5 justo llego a cumplir el año y salto problema en las llamadas entrantes las deriva al buzón de voz diciendo q la linea "personal arg"no esta en servicio y puedo hacer llamadas pero con desvio condicional eso sale en la pantalla. Lo Resetie al cel entre a config d llamadas y ahi me sale q las llamadas estan siendo derivadas a un nro de mas de 8 dígitos que no conozco termina en 225 e intento desactiva cancelar y actualizar y no lo toma quedando fijado ese nro poniéndose en gris siendo inmodificable con un mje de error. Lo hice flashear tampoco pudieron solucionar el problema. Intente con los códigos #002# y nada. Alguna solución ya q los servicios técnicos se les quemaron los libros y no pueden solucionar el tema.. Para los que esten pensando en comprar el Xperia M5 y lean esto que sepan que no merece la pena comprarlo porque a pesar de ser una gama media con bastantes defectos su precio se situa a las de la gama alta como el Xperia Z3 o el Galaxy S5 que claramente son mucho mejores que el Xperia M5.. Hola hace unos 3 días me compre el sony M5 Dual tengo unos problemas se recalienta mucho y se me bloquea y se me apaga y para prenderlo toca oprimir el botón encendido por un largo tiempo necesito saber si tiene solución a este problema ya reset y nada sigue igual o peor por favor si alguien sabe..Gracias.

Una alternativa más confiable para desbloquear la pantalla del Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+: Intelligent Scan. Dos propuestas de mediana a baja gama de ZTE: Blade V9 y Blade V9 VITA, dos modelos con ligeras diferencias. Podría ocurrir que se repitan en otro lado, pero las cámaras del Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+ son algo único. Presentación oficial: el Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+ no viene con muchas sorpresas, pero igualmente deslumbra. SmartGSM es una de las comunidades de habla hispana más grandes sobre teléfonos celulares.

Sony's tight flagship release schedule went in overdrive this season with the Z3+, Z4v and the Z5 all right on each other's heels. Making no attempt to slow down, the Japanese are taking that spirit to the midrange as well. What are you waiting for? Upgrade.. Now, assuming that you did what any sane person would do and skipped the so-called flagship Z3+, what about people who got an M4 Aqua and were preparing to enjoy a pretty solid package for at least a year? Shall we all sympathize or is the Sony Xperia M5 a whole different kind of phone?. Sony would at least like you to believe so by getting rid of the Aqua moniker. Understanding how it can cause plenty of confusion, let's get it straight. The Xperia M5 has the very same IP68 certification for dust resistance and water proofing, letting it withstand submersion in up to 1.5 meters of water for up to half an hour.. Another thing the M4 and M5 have in common is the wide range of modifications: each has a Dual SIM variant, the one we're actually reviewing, as well as plenty of regional editions that mostly differ in terms of LTE band compatibility. And as long as we're on the subject, it is quite important to note that the M5 will have limited availability as it gets released, meaning that at least initially, it won't get in the way of the M4 Aqua in any way.. The overall shape, size and look are virtually the same, both built around a 5.0-inch screen. Yet, despite the visual similarities, the M5 is an all-round upgrade: screen resolution is bumped up to FullHD, RAM is 3GB and both cameras have about doubled the resolution: 21.5MP on the back and an impressive 13MP unit up front. But perhaps the biggest change of all is the chipset, which no longer comes from Qualcomm's factories.. It's not the first time that Sony is partnering with MediaTek, Taiwanese silicon powering quite a few Xperias in the C series and the entry-level E-series. This time around though, it's the top-of-the-line Helio X10 - a step up from the Snapdragon 615 inside the Xperia M4 Aqua.. The powerful eight cores, each running at 2.0GHz and the PowerVR G6200 GPU, put the M5 in a different league. The spec sheet is taking a stab at flagship performance, all while trying to stay within a midrange budget. The M5 currently costs a good $100 more than the M4 Aqua, at a little over $400, but it looks like the upgrades it offers are worth the extra cash. The Xperia M5 has a potent CPU / GPU combo, an impressive camera setup, plenty of RAM for multitasking and a crisp 5.0 inch FullHD display.. Sony Xperia M5 in official photos. Design-wise, the phone is almost identical to the M4 Aqua with only a few details giving it away. The M5 is actually executed following Sony's old "Omni-Balance" design, cautiously revised by the Z5 line but by no means completely redone. Anyway, if you are still into the classic Xperia look, the M5 will not disappoint.. Follow us to the next page for some close-ups. Then we'll see the Sony Xperia M5 in real action..

Sony Xperia M5 camera review: We test out the camera capabilities of Sony’s latest mid-ranger, the Xperia M5.. Considering it packs a 13-megapixel front-facer, a 21.5-megapixel sensor on the back and 4K video recording, we’ve got high hopes.. Sony only ever makes slight tweaks to its skinned take on Android and the M5 packs an almost identical user experience to the flagship Z5 family we’ve already spent the last few months with. That includes the camera interface as well.. Read next: Sony Xperia Z5: re-review after three months. By default the phone’s camera experience is set to Superior Auto mode, which feels fairly clean, with a few controls overlaid on the viewfinder. You can tap the shutter button or jump straight into recording video (1080p HD@30fps), access the gallery and switch camera modes all with the controls down the right side. If you’ve allowed location data to be saved alongside your snaps, a pin icon will appear in the top right too.. The left is even sparser, with a flash toggle, a camera switcher and a link to the options menu. In Superior Auto you can choose to switch from the default 16:9 aspect ratio to 4:3, set up a timed shutter, a smile-detection shutter, whether you see a preview of the snap you’ve just taken after capture, whether holding the shutter initiates burst capture and a toggle for face recognition.. It’s without question a full-featured experience and that’s before you dip into the options for video. The ability to actually choose capture resolution for both stills and video doesn’t actually appear unless you switch modes, which is a little annoying as it’s not immediately apparent that the default 16:9 images aren’t captured in full 21-megapixel glory (you have to switch to 4:3 for the privilege), but nonetheless it’s clean and doesn’t feel as overcrowded as the experience on offer from the likes of LG’s or Samsung’s camera experiences (although the latter has worked to slim down its UI in recent iterations too).. If you tap the mode button the Xperia M5 comes well stocked with an array of different specialised abilities; like the filters found in Creative Effect mode and Sony’s signature AR tricks – from AR Effect (think 3D T. rexs and fish passing through your snaps) to AR mask, which can overlay a face on your face (albeit poorly when compared to the likes of similar Snapchat filters). It still seems odd that Timeshift mode (read: slow-motion recording) and 4K capture are billed as standalone modes, but that’s simply a quirk of Sony’s interface design and has been presented as such since the company first added the features to its mobile devices a few years back.. Should the 13 pre-loaded camera modes not whet your appetite, there are more available to download from both Sony and third-parties through a secondary tab within the camera UI; with tools for scanning documents, augmented reality flight tracking and more on offer (although not all of these extra modes are necessarily free).. It’s always important to remember that a high megapixel count does not a good camera make, but in this instance the M5 genuinely comes with decent imaging skills to back up those big numbers, particularly for a mid-range handset.. Click on camera samples to view in full resolution (opens in new tab).. Shots from the rear 21.5-megapixel snapper are captured in a 4:3 aspect ratio at full resolution and pack a respectable amount of punch. As with most smartphone cameras it’s most comfortable in natural light, but even bright artificial lighting helped yield pleasing results from the Exmor RS sensor.. You have to crop in quite far to notice any significant degradation in image quality, making the M5 a great device for social media, where shots undergo a touch of compression during the upload process – finer details can get lost depending on the environment though. The results when using HDR feel heavy-handed with the brightest elements in our test photos becoming blown out and other areas appearing over-saturated, but the resultant images are still pleasing overall.. The other main weakness is the camera’s underwhelming macro capabilities, where the phone struggles to focus at far greater distances that other serious (and admittedly more expensive) camera phones can handle. That said the shots again retain a lot of detail provided you’re shooting your subject from far enough away.. Grain unsurprisingly appears in poor lighting conditions and the finer details become murky, but even without the flash you should still be able to take something useful away when shooting in low light. Manual control is also on-hand should you want to scene settings or white balance any further, however it’s a relatively shallow take on manual versus what you’ll experience on the likes of the LG G4 or the latest Lumia devices.. Whilst the rear camera is impressive, a look at the front of the M5 and you’ll notice it also boasts a serious front-facer. The 13-megapixel camera sensor doesn’t enjoy all the same functionality as the phone’s main snapper, but you still get some level of manual control (mainly over resolution an aspect ratio) as well as the option of skin softening (read: beauty mode), which actually does a nice job of smoothing out skin without it looking too artificial.. It took a couple of tries to get the autofocus to behave, but when it does, shots carry plenty of fine detail even in artificial lighting, making it a strong offering if you plan to snapping yourself and your friends at arm’s length.. As we mentioned at the top of this article, the Xperia M5 appears to punch above its weight with regards to video recording. In Superior Auto, the camera defaults to Full HD resolution, but in manual you can select from MMS quality and length, 4:3 VGA (640×480), right up to 1080p at 60 frames per second for super-smooth footage (60fps isn’t available on the front camera).. For the most part footage looks nice and crisp and colour reproduction is excellent. The camera struggles with exposure in high contrast scenarios, but luckily the ability to shoot video with HDR on is a nice extra that has its uses. Sony also promises fast 0.25 second autofocus, but the M5 seems to really struggle with recognising when a subject moves from near to far or vice versa. The camera sometimes remained locked in at close range for a few seconds before adjusting.. Filming handheld produces noticeably shaky footage and as there’s no optical image stabilisation system, it falls to the company’s SteadyShot software to smooth things out, which it does so well, even if there’s a signature wobble to the footage after the fact.. The big feather in the M5’s cap is that it’s a mid-range phone with 4K video recording. It’s perhaps the only new device in its class capable of capturing footage at such a high resolution and the results are rammed full of detail. You’ll still encounter the same issues with high-contrast scenarios as you would shooting at a lower resolution, but overall the quality is really good and footage is very pleasing to the eye.. The trade off is that by default shooting in 4K pulls up a temperature warning, just as you’d find when using the phone’s AR modes. It’s not a massive problem, but worth remembering if you were planning on capturing any long clips above Full HD resolution.. Sony describes the Xperia M5 as a “super mid-range” phone and even if you were going by the camera alone, we’d have to agree. Whilst it does unquestionably have a few weaknesses here and there, the camera experience feels comparable to the likes of the phone’s own Z5 siblings and the other flagship handsets in the same space.. If you’re looking for an attractive, well-featured device that places a special emphasis on camera quality, without breaking the bank, the Sony Xperia M5 can be had for around £300 SIM-free, and it’s only going to become more affordable as time goes on..

Sony Xperia M5 review: middle class problems. Sony has placed a new model at the top of its M class of smartphones, the Sony Xperia M5. It looks very similar to the Xperia Z3+, but is not quite as well-equipped on the inside. Its standout feature is a very promising front-facing camera, but what else is on offer from the phone Sony calls its "super mid-ranger"? Find out in our. The Sony Xperia M5 is available in black, white or gold and is selling for around US$350 unlocked on Amazon. You can pick up a 2015 flagship for around the same price, such as Sony's own Xperia Z3+.. The Sony Xperia M5 is waterproof.. The corners are metal, to help cushion the device from blows. The Xperia M5 is 7.6 mm thick. The microUSB port doesn't have a cover, but is protected by a water-repellent coating. The design falls in line with Sony’s OmniBalance principles. The innovation is in the details. The Xperia M5 takes bath night in its stride.. All that glitters is not gold. Sony might have given the Xperia M5 the appearance of a Z series device, but the frame is made of plastic, not metal, leaving the M5 feeling noticeably cheaper than the Z3+. The housing is, however, completely waterproof and dustproof to IP65 / 68 certification.. Measuring in at 145 x 72 x 7.6 mm, and weighing 143 g, the Xperia M5 is almost as compact and light as a Galaxy S6 .. The design falls in line with Sony’s OmniBalance principles, which have seen little in the way of change since 2013. The innovation is in the details: there are metal corners, which are designed to protect the Xperia M5 when it’s dropped.. The glass panels on the front and back are made of hardened mineral glass. The edges of the frame extend marginally, so the glass panes feel slightly sunken. The advantage of this construction, according to Sony, is that the glass is less likely to break.. Sony has certified the Xperia M5 to IP65 / 68, meaning it is water- and dust-resistant and will survive up to 30 minutes in water and withstand depths of up to 1.5 m without damage to the electronics.. While the slots for the SIM card and microSD card are protected by rubber covers, the Micro-USB port has a water-repellent coating and therefore comes without a cover.. The Xperia M5's IPS display presents an excellent image. Pixels on the Xperia M5's display are visible only under a magnifying glass. display is excellent, and reproduces colors brilliantly. The contrast and color range are extensive and rich and the image quality. comes close to that of Samsung's OLED screens.. The display is a 5-inch IPS panel with a full HD resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels and a pixel density of 441 ppi. It exceeds the average resolving power of the human eye; at least from a normal viewing distance of 50 cm.. Sony's X-Reality software optimization also offers improved quality. It is designed to reduce noise, and together with the Triluminous engine, artificially increases the color palette to achieve more realistic shades and tones than most other smartphones.. The Sony Xperia M5 should receive regular software updates. Sony's Xperia UI software interface has been simplified over the years. Our Xperia M5 was running Android 5.1 with the January 2016 security patch. Sony provides regular software updates that include bug fixes and security updates.. Recently, Sony has been experimenting with even more simplified software that is nearly as minimalist as stock Android. The number of pre-installed apps has decreased, but it is not yet at the level of Motorola devices such the Moto X Pure Edition , which only comes with four pre-installed Motorola apps.. Here is a list of pre-installed Sony apps that you can not uninstall:. If you do not use these apps, then they are unnecessary ballast. of internal memory on the M5, only about 7 MB is. actually left free from the off.. The scarce internal memory can be expanded with a microSD card, which you would be wise to use.. In real-life use, performance wasn't quite as satisfactory as the benchmark scores suggest. Sony has built the fastest available MediaTek processor into the Xperia M5. The Helio X10 is an octa-core processor with eight Cortex-A53 CPUs running at 2.0 GHz, the same as what you'll find inside the Qualcomm Snapdragon 615, which we know from smartphones such as the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua, the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 and the Moto X Play. The much cheaper Honor 5X uses an almost identical Snapdragon 616.. The benchmark results of the Xperia M5 are, predictably, very similar to those of the Snapdragon devices. In Geekbench 3.3.2 single-core test, the M5 scored 828 points, compared to the Moto X Play, which got 717. In the multi-core test, the Xperia M5 scored 2,801 against the Moto X Play's 2,558.. In terms of gaming performance, Basemark X 1.1 Medium gave the Xperia M5 12,558, while the Moto X Play scored 10,637 in the same test. The OnePlus X, a significantly cheaper device, is faster than the M5, scoring 910 in the Geekbench single-core benchmark and 20,207 in Basemark X 1.1 Medium.. In real-life use, performance wasn't quite as satisfactory as the benchmark scores suggest. Games, for example, tended to resort. Sony Xperia M5 initially seems to have few weaknesses in terms of its everyday operation, which could lead to it being a frustrating device in the long run. With 16 GB of internal storage, Sony has left a lot to be desired. Once you've turned the device on for the first time and set up your Google account, you're left with a measly 7 GB of free space. This equates to a few dozen apps with app data, a few hundred photos or just a few hours of Full HD video. So you should, as soon as possible, add a MicroSD card to store your images, videos and apps on. Just so you gain enough free space for app updates.. Unlike the Sony's Z series, the Xperia M5 does not come with headphones. The integrated speakers are more basic than in the Z range, and offer mono rather than stereo sound. The maximum volume is also quite low. The microphones, on the other hand, can record sound in stereo.. Full gallery of test shots taken with the Sony Xperia M5. Sony has equipped the M5 with a similar sensor to the Xperia Z5. Unfortunately, the front-facing camera lacks a flash. The M5 camera produces no visible noise under artificial. The main camera's sensor is pleasingly sensitive to light. Macro images also come out well-focused. The autofocus is more than capable of capturing moving objects. The M5's camera is also capable of producing decent night shots. The main camera delivers high-contrast, sharp images in 21.5 MP and the selfie camera produces pleasing wide-angle shots in 13 MP. The quick-start function can be used to wake the phone from standby and go directly into the camera app.. The cameras are the selling point for the otherwise unremarkable Xperia M5. provided the phone with one the best sensors on the market. The Exmor RS is distinguished by its fast autofocus, which takes only 30 milliseconds. Thanks to face- and smile-detection technology, you can shoot selfies without even having to press. As with most Xperia smartphones, the M5 also has a. physical camera button on its side. Pressing this button while the smartphone is in standby mode, will instantly wake. The Sony Xperia M5, although gifted with excellent camera sensors, has not, unfortunately, been equipped with a great flash. LED flash is now a common feature on smartphone cameras. The addition of a second, more reddish flash ensuresskin tones don't appear faded and that people's faces look more natural.. There are also numerous smartphones with flashes on the front for low-light selfies. The Xperia M5 does not have either of these features, just a simple white flash on the back.. Sony's default camera app is quite complicated to use. In low-light conditions, you are forced to manually adjust the settings, which sometimes takes a long time, and the autofocus is also much slower in darker environments.. However, when we tried some alternative camera apps, we were able to take better shots in the dark. Overall, the M5 camera is a reliable and powerful tool, but, given it's the phone's biggest selling point, it could still be better.. The power-saving mode, Stamina, helps to increase standby time. Contrary to Sony's promise of two-day battery life, I found myself having to charge the Xperia M5 every day. The power-saving mode, Stamina, helps to increase standby time, but in active use, I only managed to squeeze out about three-and-a-half hours of display-on time.. The Sony Xperia M5 houses a 2,600 mAh battery, which is about average for a five-inch smartphone. The Samsung Galaxy S6, or the HTC One M9 , devices with the same or similar-sized batteries, achieve similar results, although they also possess much more powerful hardware. Both of these devices, come March or April, will be much more favorable purchases.. With luck, Sony can make the M5 more efficient and longer-lasting, particularly once Android 6.0 Marshmallow arrives on the device. The new version of Android includes Doze mode, which saves on power. How Sony might improve the display-on time of the Xperia M5 remains unknown.. It's complicated to classify the Xperia M5 and appraise it accordingly. Sony appears to want the M5 to occupy the same market space as the Xperia Z3+. The older device looks almost identical to the M5, but it has weaker cameras and has received criticism for its overheating problems.. The Xperia M5's performance is well below that of similarly expensive smartphones, and its cameras, despite being. highlights, do not provide exceptional results. 2015 flagships, such as the LG G4 are now available for similar prices, and provide more bang for your buck in several key areas in key places (battery life, speed, photo quality).. However, if the Xperia M5's price were to drop down towards the US$300 mark, it could become a purchase worth considering.. Hello I am disappointed with my M4 and M5 SONY AQUA the problem is that the glass and all the telephone is to fragile. Both telephones screen glass got broken-down. this just having them in my pants front pocket and I wonder how many of you have the same problem? The worst is that normally the guaranty don't cover the broken screen glass and i contacted the shop in Norway Leftdal (Ski senter, ski town) who told me they have to send the telephone to the SONY workshop so they can check it but if they find there is no guaranty and if i want to get my phone back it cost me 430 Nkr = 51,87 Amerikanske dollar. And they sustain that is the practice of all mobile phones companies. So I got shock first I get a bad quality Item so bad service This is the price we customs pay for Companies can grow global and competitive? The fact is they can't grow so big and keep a quality standard with out it affect us customs. Those are the last Mobile phones I buy from SONY and I recommend you keep away from those phones they are to weak until the make more solid telephones what is your experience?.

Sony Xperia M5: Camera, Battery life, Verdict. Sony Xperia M5 review: Design Sony Xperia M5 review review: Screen Sony Xperia M5 review: Performance and specifications. For a company that’s struggling to make its mobile business work, Sony sure like to pump out smartphones. The top-end Xperia Z range has three models to choose from, ranging from the excellent pint-sized Z5 Compact all the way up to the entirely superfluous Z5 Premium. Then there’s a budget range represented by the Xperia C selection and, finally, there’s Xperia M. That’s M for mid-range, represented here by the Sony Xperia M5.. Best smartphones of 2016: The 25 best mobile phones you can buy today. Sony Xperia Z5 review: A fragile, ageing beauty. None of these are bad – in fact, some are downright brilliant – and yet Sony continues to struggle. The M5 is unlikely to change any of that: it’s another solid device, but no trends are being bucked in this particular neighbourhood, and certainly not enough to justify the inflation-busting £100 the M5 has on last year’s M4 Aqua.. At a glance, you’d be forgiven for thinking you were looking at the Z5 when examining the 5in M5 for the first time, which is quite the compliment, considering the latter retails for £220 less. It’s something of an acquired taste, depending on how much you like oblongs. Sony hasn’t been quick to embrace curves, unlike HTC and Apple, although the edges are gently rounded off. The back is completely flat, although it does have a slightly raised “lip” like its more expensive sibling.. There’s actually no need for this here. On the Xperia Z5, the lip is presumably designed to prevent the glass back plate from cracking (something that didn’t help Jon Bray when his review unit succumbed to that very fate), but the M5’s frame is all plastic. You can’t tell at a glance, and it’s not unpleasant to the touch, but if you’re scratching your head and wondering where Sony are making the savings, that’s a pretty obvious starting point.. Another is the lack of a fingerprint sensor. The Z5 had by far the nicest fingerprint sensor I’ve ever used on a phone because it was situated on the edge of the handset rather than the front or rear. However, for cost saving reasons, there’s no scanner here, with the button replaced by a small round power nub.. It does retain the Xperia family’s traditional waterproofing, though, with an IP68 rating, meaning it'll survive if you drop it in the bath, or subject it to the kind of toilet dunking that would prove terminal for other mobiles. I don't recommend you make a habit of that, however.. The similarities continue when you switch the phone on. Like the Z5 (and the Z5 Premium when not in its two supported 4K apps), the M5's 5in screen has a resolution of 1,080p, which means that everything is pleasingly sharp. In our tests, we found quality was very good, although not quite up there with company’s pricier offerings.. Maximum screen brightness hit an impressive 543cd/m², which is high compared to the majority of handsets (and near identical to the iPhone 6s) but a lot lower than the Z5, which crushes pretty much everything else on the market with its maximum brightness of 684cd/m².. In other areas, the Xperia M5 fares less well, reproducing 92% of the sRGB gamut spectrum, compared to the Xperia Z5’s 99%, while its contrast ratio is a fair bit lower too: 840:1 compared to the Z5’s 1,078:1. The hugely popular OnePlus 2 scored 90% on sRGB coverage, and you may not be able to spot the differences or care about them, but they are most definitely there to be seen.. Performance is where the cracks begin to show, but it’s perfectly acceptable for day-to-day use, with app switching and scrolling between windows snappy, even if the camera app does take a while to open. The Xperia M5 has 16GB of storage, with a microSD slot for extending that by up to 200GB.. While the Xperia Z5 series is backed by a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chip, the M5’s duties fall to the MediaTek MT6795, and its benchmark results are markedly weaker, even with the M5’s 3GB of RAM backing things up.. Then again, it does retail for £220 less, so for comparisons’ sake, here it is compared to a couple of similarly priced quality handsets: the Nexus 5X (£339) and the OnePlus 2 (£249).. It isn't good reading for the Sony Xperia M5. It’s one thing to be roundly beaten by a more expensive model in the same family, but quite another to be beaten by one slightly more expensive and another £50 cheaper. True, both the Nexus 5X and OnePlus 2 two of the finest handsets you can buy right now, but performance-wise, they’re in a different league to the Xperia M5..

Clean design Great cameras Feature packed. Screen could be better Questionable aesthetic elements Weak graphical performance. Sony Xperia M5 review: The new Xperia M5 was never originally meant to sell in the UK. It launched in the second half of 2015 in other markets, but we’re glad Sony had a change of heart and finally brought it to our shores.. Sony doesn’t really make mention of its OmniBalance design language anywhere near as much as it did when the original Xperia Z came into being, but it’s still alive and well, serving as the aesthetic rulebook when creating the company’s latest smartphones, including the M5.. The design feels closer to the Z3 than the Z5 , with rounded corners and edges, as well as a signature metal power key – no fingerprint sensor for this mid-ranger. The phone comes in three colours with the gold device we tested highlighting the particularly shiny edges and corners of the body. They cheapen the appearance of the phone slightly, but it still looks good overall and feels nice in the hand.. Like its predecessor, the M5 packs IP65/68 waterproofing whilst retaining an exposed microUSB port and headphone jack, ensuring those clean lines aren’t ruined by awkward seals or exceptionally bulky bodywork. The one remaining flap on the phone’s left side conceals both a nanoSIM tray and a microSD card slot.. The M5’s 5-inch display is skirted by fairly large bezels, but they don’t add too much to the phone’s footprint overall. The screen itself sports a Full HD resolution too, which means this mid-ranger technically boasts a sharper screen than the premium Z5 Compact .. Head-on the IPS LCD panel offers accurate colours and contrast, even at more extreme angles, however brightness can quickly drop off and appears to be a little on the weak side, even when pushed to its maximum. Automatic brightness is also a little slow to respond, often leaving you blinded in a dark room, or straining to see what’s on-screen in bright environments.. On the flip side, the smart backlight feature is a nice touch that keeps the display on irrespective of screen timeout settings, during handheld use. As with other Sony handsets, the M5 also boasts glove mode that boosts touch sensitivity, which is particularly handy in those winter months.. Sony hasn’t yet pushed the Xperia M5 up to the latest version of Android, however 5.1 Lollipop with the company’s light skinning feels fluid and well laid out for everyday use.. The company has reined in its proprietary software in favour of more established third-party offerings of late and that means that whilst the M5 has some distinctly Sony software and services, it doesn’t feel weighed down by bloatware.. The Xperia Lounge app offers up exclusive deals to Sony users, whilst Socialife is the company’s Apple News/HTC Blinkfeed/Flipboard equivalent. Thankfully the phone also boasts a suite of PlayStation apps and although it doesn’t support Remote Play, you still have tools to enjoy the world of PlayStation on the go, provided you’re a fan of Sony’s signature console as well as its smartphones.. There are other smaller touches that deserve a mention too, such as integrated screen recording tools, LinkedIn calendar integration, Spotify and Podcast functionality within the Music app and a handful of useful third-party offerings out-the-box.. Considering the phone originally touched down in other markets back in August 2015, the internals still feel fresh and deliver a smooth experience that could fool you into thinking this is a more powerful handset than the spec sheet lets on. The MediaTek Helio X10 chipset is an uncommon choice amongst devices in the UK and aside from some shortcomings in the graphics department, it’s a competent piece of hardware.. As with Sony’s premium handsets the M5 features NFC, a heap of connectivity options and room to expand upon the 16GB of internal memory by up to an additional 200GB using microSD too.. The 2600mAh battery tires out before a day and a half of use (switching it off at night), which is a little disappointing, but if you’re willing to fall back on the Sony’s STAMINA technology, the M5 will keep going until the end of a second day, just.. Easily the biggest selling point for the Xperia M5 is its camera arrangement. On the back you’ll find a huge 21.5-megapixel Exmor RS sensor, whilst selfie fans will appreciate the sizeable 13-megapixel front-facer.. Sony’s managed to strike a good balance of features versus usability in the M5. The interface doesn’t feel too crowded, but you have a plethora of modes to toy with; from Auto to augmented reality offerings. Manual control isn’t anywhere near as deep as you’d find on the likes of the LG G4 or the latest Lumia phones, but its presence highlights the fact that the M5 isn’t messing around; mid-ranger or not.. High contrast scenarios are the biggest challenge for the phone’s main camera, although HDR and DIS (digital image stabilisation) are at your disposal to help smooth out resultant stills and video.. Speaking of video, the M5 also comes with both slow-motion video and 4K video recording, which is unheard of in the mid-range market. Autofocus isn’t as proactive as we’d like or Sony claims it is, but to get a better idea of image and video quality, check out our dedicated camera review.. The M4 Aqua was already a great mid-ranger, but Sony has improved on it in every way with the Sony Xperia M5, which feels like it pushes the boundaries of what could honestly be considered mid-range.. At £300 SIM-free it becomes a toss-up between this and older flagships, but the price will undoubtedly drop pretty quickly and you get plenty of bang for your buck as it stands. Beyond the strong imaging experience, the M5’s svelte design, robust feature set and waterproofing skills mean that it’s a great smartphone for anyone looking for a top tier experience without the price tag..

Sony Xperia M5 and Xperia C5 Ultra leak in full. by XB on 31st July 2015. in Rumours , Xperia C5 Ultra , Xperia M5. New Sony Xperia C5 Ultra and Xperia M5 devices have leaked in full ahead of their formal reveal next week as Russian site Hi-Tech.Mail.ru has just published a preview of both devices.. The Xperia C5 Ultra is the one that will probably get all of the headlines, a unique frameless smartphone from Sony that looks gorgeous, whilst the Xperia M5 looks like a lower-cost version of the Xperia Z3+, sporting very similar design cues and a very capable camera. You can check out some close-up photos of each device below as well as a specs rundown.. The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra has a huge 6-inch 1080p screen and a virtually non-existent side frame. This is just 0.8mm thin, this compares to a 2.2mm thin side frame in the Xperia C4 and 2.5mm thin frame in the Xperia T2 Ultra. These small bezels mean that that the Xperia C5 Ultra is barely much bigger than the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus.. The Xperia C5 Ultra will have a front-facing flash and will sport a 13MP camera sensor on both the front and rear. The phone will have a glossy plastic rear and aluminium sides and will arrive in three colours including black, white and mint.. It will be powered by the MediaTek MT6752 chipset with 1.7GHz octa-core processor, 2GB RAM, 16GB internal storage and have microSD memory card support. The battery is a bit disappointing with a capacity of 2930mAh, we would have hoped for something bigger given the size of the display.. Other specs include NFC and dual-SIM card support. The Xperia C5 Ultra weighs 187 grams. The Russian price of the Sony Xperia C5 Ultra is expected to be around 21k-22k rubles ($343 – $359).. The Sony Xperia M5 has a very similar design to the Xperia Z3+, including the glossy corner caps. The Xperia M5 has a 5-inch 1080p IPS display and is powered by the MediaTek Helio X10 chipset with 2GHz octa-core processor, 3GB RAM, 16GB internal storage and microSD memory card slot. The Xperia M5 will have a 2600mAh battery capable of two-day battery life according to Sony. A dual-SIM version will also be available.. The Xperia M5 camera has a lot going for it and it looks like it will include the IMX230 CMOS sensor. It will have a rear 21.5MP Exmor RS sensor capable of hybrid autofocus, f/2.2 and fast autofocusing (0.2 seconds). The device will also support 5x zoom with no perceptible loss in quality and 4K video recording. The front-facing camera will have a 13MP sensor.. The Xperia M5 has a thickness of 7.6mm and will be available in three colours: black, silver and gold. The handset also has IP65/IP68 dust and water certification and a capless USB port. It has metallic features on the edge, but the rear is plastic. The Russian price of the Sony Xperia M5 is expected to be around 24k-25k rubles ($390 – $406).. Upcoming Xperia flagship (H82XX) will have 18:9 display, Snapdragon 845 says benchmark. New Sony C670X details leak: 4.8-inch FHD display, 1.8GHz Snapdragon 600 [Update]. Sony QX10 and QX100 ‘lens-style’ cameras get priced; specs leak in full. Xperia Tipo will be the name for the ST21i ‘Tapioca’. Is good but sony can not update on android m on this devices. Looking forward to the m5 being a hit..the c5 will be in the phablet series.. The C5 looks quite stunning but i wish it had the all metal & glass body like the Z series, but it seems quite attractive nonetheless.. Will even buy any of the above over the 1+2.. C5 Ultra was almost perfect successor of Z Ultra except low RAM and Battery. And again ruined the awesome device. M5 is awesome except poor battery. But if they’re launched as mid ranger, then both of them are unbeatable regardlessly.. Wow! C5 is gorgeous! Won’t mind downgrading from the Z2 just for its looks!. Love the bezels of C5 Ultra but I am kinda disappointed with the overall design.. This kind of confirms we’ll see a 6 inch Z Ultra. As per experience of z series and m series.. The date on the page was Aug. 3, so it was supposed to be shown on Monday but somehow “unintentionally” got leaked.. And for this article, in such a case, many thanks to XperiaBlog! I lost respect for the site for quite a while. They exclusives sometimes wrote and not washed. Sorry if the translation from the Russian language is not clear.. Looks like Sony is going backwards on their battery. Anyway, the only selling point of the C5 is it’s bezel-less sides. Nothing really new on it, unless it’s priced very cheap. The M5 would be a very good phone if priced as cheap as the M4 Aqua, which might sound impossible but should be the way to go if they want to really profit from it. Really interested on the new 21MP sensor, really fast autofocus (and hopefully fast capture as well, for god’s sake) and that 5x (optical?) lossless zoom.. I love you Sony , now a new Transparent Sony UI ,USB typ C use and the Sony Smartphones are perfect !. M is not even out yet, just for devs. The Z series is currently being updated to 5.1.1. What experience are you talking about?. Were you able to read? ). This has all of my nope.. Basically what has been written here. Here’s a cached version, just translate it:. where r those pro retards who hates mediatek. C5 is a midranger, if you want glass and metal you have to wait for next Z Ultra.. M5 won’t nbe a hit because of dull, generic design and massive bezels.. Can someone tell me is M5 a high end device or a midranger?. It’s cool but I’d like to see the display centered to the body of the device.. I hoped I’ll change my z3 with something better,but it seems that there’s nothing better than z3+! 6 inch display is so pathetic and a new camera senzor on a mid range phone…thank you sony…we pay a lot of money for flagships that are a step behind!. High mid ranger like Moto X play.. Sony is going to deliver it as a mid ranger but it’s capable of beating a flagship. Just awesome device if leaks are true. Maybe I am going to downgrade myself from flagship to mid ranger guy. And M5 is completely responsible for the downgrade. They look gorgeous! I don’t care what others may say. Always wining someone :-o this is awesome but it’s has not been ifa yet coming better phones then ;-) this was very nice ;-). Rumour? I can’t find this in Hi-Tech.Mail.Ru.. As Android 5.1.1 and this processor consume less power and Sony can optimize software perfectly, C5 battery life shouldn’t be so disappointing. But still could be little bigger. However, according to price not bad at all.. Maybe I am going to downgrade myself from flagship to mid ranger guy. And M5 is completely responsible for the downgrade. Sony is going to deliver it as a mid ranger but it’s capable of beating a flagship. Just awesome device if leaks are true. Maybe I am going to downgrade myself from flagship to mid ranger guy. And M5 is completely responsible for the downgrade.. for giving you a little hope: if their mid rangers are going to be like this, now think how awesome their next flagship is going to be…. it’s not a disappointing news man rather raise of hope from SOny….

I’m ready to retire my Z3C and downgrade to M5. I just hope that it is aluminium frame, not plastic.. I just got m4 and M5 is here. very unlikely that m5 will cost ~400$. almost same specs as z3+ which costs almost 800$.. Aluminium frame and Aqua color would make M5 a perfect midranger but I don’t think sony will give it Aqua color option since it exclusives to Z3+ only -_-. YES WHEN Z SERIES SO EXPENSIVE THEY WANT CHEAPER. So, in the paper the M5 is even better than Z1-Z3? Wow :/. So basically Xperia M5 is Xperia Z3+ with a downgrade (or better processor, depending who you ask), a slighlty lower RAM and internal storage (i don’t mind), a lower battery capacity (I’m little worry), with same beautiful design albeit a little thicker, better sensor IMX230, phase detection autofocus, much better selfie camera and same dust and waterproof? I’m sold. why lower? z3+ have 3gb too i guess? i don’t believe it will cost ~400$. With Xperia M5 use IMX230, i think it’s impossible for Sony to used it again in their flagship Xperia Z5 (it will become obsolete) so I hope Z5 will come with their 2/3″ Curved sensor. so it smells a bit for a ~400$.. I’m sorry, i thought Xperia M5 have 2 GB RAM, and it’s actually have 3 GB RAM although it will come with LPDDR3 because MediaTek not supported LDDR4 yet. still 400$ for M5 seems low a bit..

The display on Xperia M5 Aqua looks have much better contrast and saturation compare to C5 Ultra, is that IPS-NEO that Huawei used in their P8?. Pingback: Sony Xperia C5 Ultra, le smartphone de 6 pouces aux bords très fins - MKDIR-INFORMATIQUE (). Pingback: POKORNY | Upcoming Sony Xperia C5 Ultra and Xperia M5 shown off in leak (). I think Sony cut the bezels on their Xperia M5 compare to Xperia M4 Aqua who has really super big bezels. But why Sony rushed their midrange so quickly while Xperia M4 Aqua only released a few months ago. That’s a crazy good price for the C5 Ultra, real sleek looking too. Still waiting to see what the Z5 is going to be like before buying a new phone, really considering the OnePlus Two right now.. i dont remember who was the guy claiming we need nvidia or amd in our phone and not mediatek but. this is why we dont see nvidia chips in phones from all manufactures. Gotta see the camera perform first tho. Just waiting o the Z Ultra successor. I dont know why Sony has waited for so long. Theyre complaining about sales, well your Z Compact and normal Z# owners have nothing to upgrade too. But us Ultra users are waiting patiently, releasr and wat h all Z Ultra owners come running.. No they didn’t, M5 and M4 have identical bezels. M5 is a higher end phone than M4 (much better processor, cameras, more RAM, better display).. There are other phones with great cameras in this price range. Besides Sony’s have pretty mediocre cameras, their image processing is pretty poor..

EXACTLY! i’m boarding the z5 hype train and won’t even care what happens if the c5 and m5 turn out to be this. and to mention that the camera in the M5 can already brought z series to shame…. All in all in great phones. But still 1 small problem, Sony is at it again with it’s stupid 6 month cycle. To many phones with to many problems, At this rate in 2 years time we’ll have M12Aqua, C12, Z12 etc.. hey both devices got front facing speakers right??my nakes eyes cant really see those thing. The mediatek chip in c5 was the one capable. capable shooting 480fps video I think. Maybe it was split second capturing sony means. And helio x10 is their flagship chip. Actually I feel more better play some apps in mtk chip better than snapdragon. One of those apps is ppsspp. Only downside of mtk chip is bootloader unlock support..

I am said that only z series is update. Any other series like m and c not update quickly. oh dang it I thought next week will be z5... but you don’t see the phone yet, right?. let’s just wait and see about overall performance on both and we can all judge them of what they did wrong. i think it’ll cost at 400 euros, not dollars :D. well in dollars, i think it’s around 460s.

Z5 will still feature the same EXMOR RS 20.7 MP camera that’s over 2 years old.. if you’re using the original z and original m, you can say that. but this thing hasn’t even announced yet. It have to be upgraded to m, and it will be.. yeah yeah yeah, it won’t be a hit. but when they send you one of their m5’s for free, you want it, right?. Latest mediatek cpu is better than before. Although the gpu is little weak compared to Adreno. But it was lower cost, lower power consumption than Snapdragon, and no heating whatsoever, so why not?. big deal! the phone isn’t even announced yet. even their mid range uses 21.5 mp imx230 like m5. but if they use sd810 for their midrange, you’ll complain too, right..?:P.

I know they benchmark poorly, but in reality they’re as fast as Snapdragon.. You hate Mediatek and Snapdragon, What do you like exactly?. Problem is that the gpu is too weak. Based on the pictures it seems the speaker for C5 is in the front while the M5 speaker is on the bottom.. Hope the price mentioned above is correct. C5 with the front speaker looks very tempting..

Because it’s free, not because it’s nice. In real world question is: are you ready to pay for it? And the answer is no.. M5 and M4 have identical bezels. M5 is a higher end phone than M4.. Xperiablog, can you please find out and share where in the world is the next z ultra e6833? thanks in advance.. The Z3 Compact would be perfect with a fingerprint sensor. It’s convenient to unlock your phone with your fingerprint.. Pingback: Specs von Xperia C5 Ultra und Xperia M5 enthüllt | Smartphone (). I have a gaming pc too. I’m afraid that’s not a solution.. to upgrade from Z3C or not…. They could have bumped the battery up to around 3000mAh. Top and bottom bezels look bigger than those of the Z3C. Hopefully Sony adds at least a green or blue color option. Maybe I’ll sit this one out. though i’m intrigued by the new camera.. Patiently waiting for the Z5 instead of these cheapo Mediatek wannabes.. If I want a cheap Mediatek phone, I’ll get a Xiaomi.. Pingback: ????? ??? ???????? ????? ???? Xperia C5 ?

That’s Sony for you lol But the good news is they might end up putting something better than 230 on their next flagship!. M4 just came out, right? I’ll be really surprised if Sony releases M5 anytime soon. It’ll be too early ….even by Sony’s standard lol So just wait till M5 gets officially announced.. Exactly, that’s the main problem with Sony phones with Mediatek chips. GPU performance used to be another issue in the past. I hope they have figured that out by now..

The M5 may end up being a better phone than the Z5, simply by not having an overheating Snap Dragon 801/810/820 chipset.. Z2, Z3, Z4 have all been overheating, over time cooking the waterproof glue that holds the back panel, until it comes off.. Sony’s UI is already the least annoying, sometimes even pleasing UI of all I’ve tried.. I haven’t heard of the transparent UI you mention, is that a Sony demo or the work of an independent modder?.

Z5 will probably be using snapdragon 810 again. Pingback: ????? ??? ???????? ????? ???? Xperia C5 ? Xperia M5 - ???? ??? ???? (). What you call overheat is actually called throttling and all phones do that. Since phones have no active cooling they have to reduce heat by lowering the clock speed.

I hope with imx230 they’ll get the camera white balance correct, and the camera software. Hope there won’t be heating issues.. If this leak was true I would opt for a m5 to replace my old zr, c5 ultra looks cool without that bezels but i hate big phones which are above 5.5 inches and that’s the reason why I did’nt made an upgrade recently. I thought of buying a z3+ and almost bought it but dropped for a single reason ‘overheating’ and thought of buying a z3 compact but this leak showed up and i heared that m5’s gonna sport a sony’s new camera module!! that’s insane cuzz they didn’t opt for a new model in the flagship but upgrading a midranger(so called) with new module.

Exactly, after all the overheating issues with the M4 I am glad they went a different way for the M5. no stupid invite system for a start, plus I like the design of the sony models. I need a 5″ mid range dual sim handset so the M5 is perfect for me. would keep in line with the M4 though. a lot of M4 users experienced shut downs though, it was definitely an issue for the M4. I am happy to give the chipset a go, given the overheating on the M4, but the battery worries me. Pingback: ? Sony ????????C5 Ultra?M5 ???????? | 3C ?? (). Still looking for a new Xperia compact :).

Pingback: ????? ??? ???????? ????? ???? Xperia C5 ? Xperia M5 | (). Pingback: Sony Xperia C5 Ultra | Sony Xperia M5 | scheda tecnica | prezzo | uscita | rumor (). Only 2 Z5 devices coming out. There will be no 6″ Z5 Ultra only C5.. Well, UAProf says 5.2 Z5 and 5.5 Z5+ later on. Also we have the E6833 code on the postel, which confirms the existence of the Z5 Ultra. But the screen size is a mystery. I’m talking about actual overheating on Sony Z phones from Z1, Z2, Z3 and Z3+ users had their phones overheat their phones frequently enough to cook the water proof glue holding the back panel, causing it to come off or develop a gap, making the device not water proof anymore. I’m the owner of a Z2 that popped off its back after less than 6 months of use. I wasn’t even shooting 4K videos but just 1080p. You can google the issue, if you want to see for how long Sony has managed to ignore this issue.. Throttling is when the overheating gets prevented (a good thing). Overheating is when throttling was insufficient or didn’t occur when it needed to.. How hot are we talking here? I overheated my phone to extreme levels, this summer with 39C heat I was driving in my shitty car with no air conditioner, and using the Z3 as gps navigator, being stuck on the windshield directly under the sunlight, when I took it off it was so hot I could barely touch it, yet the glue held up and the phone is still waterproof. I think it’s more of a build quality defect.. Build quality defect is possibly making things worse.. My phone popped off its back panel in less than 6 months. I did also record video with the phone mounted behind the windshield and was also mounted to the windshield when I used it with Google Maps for driving in Germany, Spain, Chile and California while traveling. It was fine after all that, but when I just had it on Sony’s charge dock on a table in the Philippines, serving as a wifi hot spot, it happened. I grabbed it out of the dock to make a call and felt something loose in the back…. It never got wet, not before or after this, the moisture detectors are not activated, but the phone got super slow, and after trying to reboot it, it ended up in an endless boot cycle.. Either way, high temperatures are poison for your electronics. Even if its still working for you, life expectancy suffers from extreme heat and it suffers from frequent temperature changes, because the materials in semi conductors expand and contract at different rates..
