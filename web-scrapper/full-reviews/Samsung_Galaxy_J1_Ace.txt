By Nishit Anarkat | 28 Oct 2015. The Battery life is awfully low and 512 MB RAM is also too low.. Compared to it's price, the screen size and other features are good.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 5 out of 5 people found this review helpful. By Cazsunxa Auxifer | 3 Oct 2017. This phone is the worst phone in existence. It regularly locks up and even restarts itself sometimes. Battery jumps from 70% to 100% when you put it on charge then drops from 50% to COMPLETLY OFF WITHOUT WARNING (0%) when not on charge.. I've had this phone for over a year now and its already been back to the manufacturer on its warrenty. It came back even more slow, the bloatware eats up the (ONLY 1GB AVAILABLE) storage, You always have the Stroage Space Running Out message, Even after UNINSTALLING EVERY APP YOU HAVE. Google play services weighed in at 600MB! And will eat up ALL of your avaliable storage if you give it a chance.. This was my first smartphone experience and has not only given me a bad taste in my mouth, but have also lost all trust for samsung.. J1 Ace is the worst phone.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. nice camera and image qulity the camera recording 720p hd very nice ill give 5 out of 5 stars for this mobile..

We are just now switching from flip phones to our first smartphones. We didn't want anything too big, or too complicated. This seems to fit the bill. It's pretty user friendly, and fits in the pocket in my purse. Biggest complaint so far is the battery going dead with no warning (our flip phones would beep when the battery was low), and having to charge it every night. We found an energy saver mode, and that seems to extend the battery life a lot. So far (we've only had them 9 days) I would recommend them.......... Yes (6) No (1) Report. 1-1 of 1 reviews.

Anonymous, 25 Jan 2018 how can i upgrade to lolipop. you can upgrade to android lollipop by phone and pc. if you using phone to upgrade you should go to the setting.then update softwre. how can i upgrade to lolipop. If you love multitasking this phone is not for you and you have to compromise on which social media apps you want install cause you can't install them all. The phone heats up when you multitask facebook app and instagram. All in all this phone is best for making phone calls only. I love this smartphone, storage is not big issue for me.. i have sd memory card 256GB and some of my application i transfer to my sd card.. overall the phone is pretty good, but the storage isn't. in my opinion, I think this phone is little bit better..But still have any problems like battery, connection problem sometimes, low front camera, small Gb ram and rom..I can't download more apps in this phone.. I've had Samsung J1Ace for almost a year, and to be honest it has been a decent phone. I haven't found any major issues. The phone is always low battery, and I need to charge it often. Other than that, it has been a pretty decent phone.. WHAT?! This thing is even worse than Samsung Galaxy S2!. why do i always get connection problems or invalid MMI code when i want to check talk time. Ive had my j ace 1 nearly two years it's been great ya it has its downsides but you can tweak and download pretty much any patch fix you need if you can't play a game you just have not figured out how to yet lol it's really a great basic phone and I've dropped it out of my 2013 f f150 off road truck like a dozen times scratchs that's all the little bumpers are awesome shitty for phone covers though and I got my phone for 13$ during customer loyalty and have been made a jack ass talking about it was gonna totally sick break or whatever na good phone. itsnot support my favourite game wcc. i cannt find LTE mode called 4G ,in my phone.. i need to use 4G network. I am using a j1 ace neo for a year. powerful battery, fast and still reliable. Kev, 08 Nov 2017 Can i connet my J1 to the tv? i want to see pictures and videos from my cell on my tv.

Funciones clave Samsung Galaxy J1 Ace. Opiniones y Comentarios Samsung Galaxy J1 Ace. Hay 176 opiniones del Samsung Galaxy J1 Ace .. Un celular demasiado resistente en cuanto a golpes... Lo único feo es la capacidad de almacenamiento interno, se llena con nada... Aún así, yo amo este celular :D. PUEDO UTILIZAR MI CELULAR CON MI SMART TV. El Samsung J1 Ace, el cual uso a diario, es tremendo telefono dentro de mi escala de prioridades, con la excepción de que cuenta con poco espacio de almacenamiento causa por la cual constantemente tengo que estar liberando espacio ya sea del WS, videos, audios o de donde pueda, utilizando la memoria de expansión, pero con esa salvedad es muy muy bueno sobre todo para sincronizar correos, enviar y/o recibir imagenes ya se trate de PDF o no.. Espero que esto sirva de algo a otras personas.. Bien , quiero aclarar les algunas cosas sobre comentarios fuera de lugar , con fuera de lugar me refiero a que son quejas al J1 común con 600MB de RAM y kitkat. Ese se deja de lado porque salio malísimo , una basura.. Este apartado solo aplica a los J1 con 1gb de RAM. También aclaro que no fueron estafados , ningún equipo que diga tener 1,2,3gb de RAM los tiene al 100% tal como pasa con el almacenamiento interno. La pagina dice dual core porque acá en latinoamérica se comercializa LA MEJOR versión de J1 ace , pero en países de habla inglesa se vende una versión peor con 456mb de RAM y un procesador de dos núcleos.. También leí que era un celular obsoleto y la verdad es que esta muy desacertada tal información. El equipo tiene Lollipop (2015) pero la versión de touchwiz es la del 2016 , si no es así igual puedes flashearla.. Whatsapp pide android 2.3 y el j1 hace tiene 5.1.1. Incluso tendrá soporte muchísimos años mas para Jellybean 4.1.1. ¿porque no me entran ni salen las llamadas tengo ese problema desde hace una semana?. Quiero saber como bajarle la resolucion a la camara cuando menos a 300 kb para poder enviar fotos por mail. Bueno de ante mano les felicito por el movil es un es un artefacto muy bueno lo unico que no me cabe es porque el tactil o pantalla es demasiado caro tanto que casi al comprar la pantalla es como si comprara el movil y quisiera saber porque si el móvil ej: esta a 100$ la pantalla a 70$ la verdad no quiero perder mi movil pero quisiera un explicacion Gracias. hola que tal? quería decir que las características de este celular están mal podrían revisar eso gracias, saludos!. No puedo jusgarlo seriamente porque debii ami falta de conocimientos no puedo usar su potencial.---Saudis. Ver todas las Opiniones del Samsung Galaxy J1 Ace - Total de opiniones de usuarios: 176.

It's got a 5 MP camera with LED flash on the back, and a 2 MP snapper on the front (this one's helped by a Palm Selfie function that detects movement and lets you take selfies using hand gestures). The new Galaxy offers 512 MB of RAM, 4 GB of internal memory, microSD card support, and a 1850 mAh removable battery that should be able to provide a talk time of up to 10 hours. Ultra Power Saving mode is also available.. Dimensions: 5.08 x 2.69 x 0.35 inches (129 x 68.2 x 8.9 mm). Weight: 4.30 oz (122 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 480 x 800 pixels.

The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, CMOS image sensor. Software Features: Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Self-timer. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Panorama, Night mode, Effects.

Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running..

Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 10.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. CDMA - Code Division Multiple Access. A technique of multiplexing, also called spread spectrum, in which analog signals are converted into digital form for transmission. For each communication channel, the signals are encoded in a sequence known to the transmitter and the receiver for that channel. The foremost application is digital cellular phone technology from QUALCOMM that operates in the 800MHz band and 1.9GHz PCS band. CDMA phones are noted for their excellent call quality and long battery life.. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg)..

Samsung released the ace version of J1 Samsung Galaxy J1 Ace for south Asian market namely, Bangladesh and India. It contains a super AMOLED display whereas Galaxy J1 has a TFT display. There is also little change in the shape and design. But the high quality display is going to cost you some additional money. Also, the CPU is slightly better than the previous J1 (1.3 GHz instead of 1.2). Otherwise, we couldn't find any difference in the specs with J1. If you ask, if this is the best specification phone for the price in Bangladesh market in 2015, the answer is obviously NO. FOr this price you will get smartphones with much better specs from Symphony, Walton, Maximus, Mycell even the reputative brand Huawei.

Mobiles / Samsung Mobile Phones / Samsung Galaxy J1 Ace Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 266 Launch Date in India: 03 September, 2015 Compare. Ultra Power Saving mode Super AMOLED display Good Design. Samsung has managed to become a people's brand by actually listening to what people want and coming up with smartphones to cater to their demand. Within a single year, the handset maker has managed to come up with two new series of smartphones viz. These handset break free from monotonous Galaxy handsets and offer a large array of devices from budget to mid-range segment. Samsung Galaxy J1 Ace is the latest budget segment offering to come from the stables of South Korean handset maker.. On the design front, the Galaxy J1 Ace bears a resemblance to Samsung first ever metallic handset , Galaxy Alpha. This handset comes with similar bulges on corner like ones found on Galaxy Alpha and offers a good grip. The back panel of the handset is removable and so is the battery, which is a welcome addition.. The South Korean handset maker has equipped the Galaxy J1 Ace with a smaller 4.3 inch display, which is an attempt at cost cutting and is by no means ideal for multimedia watching. It comes with a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels, which is barely enough to enjoy high resolution graphics. Moreover, the size of the display and low resolution is a recipe for dull color reproduction.. The user experience offered by the handset is not cutting edge since it comes with a dated Android 4.4 Kitkat operating system out of the box. However, it happens to be the most stable release from Google till date and the user experience is bound to be satisfactory.. The performance of the handset is barely above average since Samsung has equipped it with a Dual-core processor that boasts of a clock speed of 1.3 GHz. The processor is further accompanied by 512 MB of RAM for performance consistency. The battery life of the handset is pretty average as it comes with an 1800 mAh battery unit.. The Samsung Galaxy J1 Ace is a quintessential budget segment smartphone from the South Korean handset maker. As such, the primary camera on the handset is a modest 5 Megapixel affair and is sufficient for routine photography. Whereas, the camera module on the front panel is a 2 Megapixel unit.. On the connectivity front, the handset is missing 4G LTE , however, it offers 3G for significantly fast Internet connectivity to its users. Besides this, the handset also offers Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and microUSB to its users.. Samsung has launched a good budget segment smartphone in the form of Galaxy J1 Ace and it is the beginning of a whole new lineup of smartphones from the brand. However, the device lacks a lot of punch against the devices that already exists in the market and if Samsung wants to succeed, it needs to up its game a notch..

Samsung Galaxy J1 Ace is said to be a new entry-level smartphone. This model has certain features that can only be found in high priced devices, so this Galaxy J1 would be a perfect smartphone to those who do not want to spend an excessive amount on their new gadgets.. Although this new Samsung Galaxy J1 Ace is a low priced model but has some interesting perks for a low-priced smartphone. But overall, this new Galaxy J1 would definitely be a value for money by the amount of different features it has offer to the users.. Everything that is needed in a modern smartphone has been featured in this model like the latest OS version, a good camera, a good amount of RAM and enough internal storage space. So although this device may not be ideal for a professional use, it can be put to use for every day simple activites.. As this new Galaxy J1 Ace is a low priced smartphone, the company has cut some corners in order to reduce its price. So this smartphone will not be able to deliver high-end performance at blazing speeds.. This new smartphone has a 4.3 inch super AMOLED capacitive display, the outer look of this Galaxy J1 is almost similar to that of the Galaxy Ace 4. There will be colour options of either blue or white.. This device is powered by a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor, and the RAM is 512 MB. The inbuilt memory of this device is 4 GB. This model runs on Android KitKat 4.4.4, a micro SD slot is present in which an external SD card can be inserted for expanding its storage space.. There is no option of a 4G connectivity and only 3G, and 2G connectivity options are available in this new Galaxy J1 Ace. Besides all these basic features that come as standard in most smartphones are installed in this model.. This new Galaxy J1 Ace has been specifically designed for the Asian markets, and it can be assumed that this model is going to be popular in the Philippines as well. This is because there are other smartphones which offer equally good features around the same price range. So the competition is tough for this Samsung Galaxy J1 Ace in the Philippines market. But providing all the moves and plans by the Korean giant turns out to be a success.. Samsung has introduced this new Galaxy J1 Ace that best meets the budget of small-time users with no desire for resource intensive performance. The company will be targeting Asian markets for the sale of this J1 Ace model.

Home / News / Samsung Galaxy J1 Review: Not the budget smartphone you’re looking for. Design Camera Software Performance Call Quality/Audio Battery Life Wrap Up • Better than average cameras •. In recent times, Samsung has shifted a lot of its focus to the Indian market. The company launched its first Tizen phone in India, made its Galaxy E series ( read our review ) exclusive to the country, and then followed up with the Galaxy J1. The Galaxy J1 is the first device in the Galaxy J lineup, and is slightly higher in price than the Samsung Z1 and also comes with slightly better – yet decidedly low-end – hardware.. The Galaxy J1 comes at a time when the budget market in countries like India has been taken over by Xiaomi, Motorola, and other Chinese and local manufacturers, which are offering some pretty stellar hardware for low prices. Even Google is playing in this segment through its Android One initiative, and when you look at the Galaxy J1’s specs sheet, it’s clear to see that Samsung isn’t really trying hard to make sure the device stand out.. spent a week with the Galaxy J1 as my main smartphone, so here’s our review of what is one of the most talked about (read leaked) budget Android phones from Samsung in a long time.. Samsung hasn’t really experimented with its smartphones’ design in the past couple of years, and so it isn’t surprising the Galaxy J1 looks like a lot of other phones from the company. However, there’s a small design aspect that makes the J1 look different – the top and bottom. of the phone have this slightly raised edge at each side, making it look like it has a rugged covering on top. That’s not actually the case, but it certainly helps in adding a touch of flair to what is otherwise as basic a design as can be expected from Samsung.. What’s also good is the build quality. The sides and back of the Galaxy J1 are made of soft touch plastic (both the sides and back, along with the volume and power buttons, are of the same color), making the phone feel pretty good in the hand. It’s not at all slippery, and overall, the J1 feels very well made.. The Galaxy J1 comes with a 4.3-inch PLS LCD display with a resolution of 800×480 pixels. There’s nothing special about the viewing experience on offer here. Being an LCD unit, the colors aren’t at all vibrant, and the display feels a tad drab in terms of colors and contrast. The viewing angles are also average – you will be able to make out what’s on the screen when viewing it an angle, but you won’t find it to be as clear as it would be on more high-end handsets (which isn’t unexpected given the price range.). The Z1, Samsung’s first Tizen phone, had quite an attractive display despite being such a lowly priced phone, so it’s sad to see the same love hasn’t been extended to the display on the Galaxy J1. The only thing the J1 is great at is the brightness levels. The display can get quite bright, and the phone also offers an Outdoor mode to further increase the legibility of the display under bright sunlight.. Samsung was clearly focusing entirely on the camera experience when developing the Galaxy J1, as the cameras on this thing easily outmatch the rest of the hardware. Now, these aren’t great cameras by any means, but when you consider how average an experience the phone provides in other areas, the cameras certainly stand out.. The phone comes with a 5-megapixel sensor on the back that takes photos that are, well, good enough. Photos come out a bit too soft, but details are a tad above average (for a 5MP sensor) and. noise is kept under control as to not be a problem. Under low-light it’s a complete failure, but like the Galaxy E5 and E7, Samsung offers Night and HDR modes in the camera to somewhat improve performance under dim lighting conditions.. The front camera is a 2-megapixel unit, and it’s pretty good. The photos it takes tend to have some noise, but they also capture an attractive amount of detail and colors. Samsung hasn’t skimped on features that let you take selfies with ease – you get the Palm Gesture feature for capturing pictures by waving your palm in front of the device, and you also get a beauty mode to soften/remove blemishes from faces. The only big issue with the front camera is that it takes a few seconds to save a photo. It’s not world-ending, but it’s odd to see a. screen each time you take a photo.. The Galaxy J1 runs a pretty bare bones version of TouchWiz, Samsung’s proprietary UX. It’s probably because of the meager hardware that’s powering this thing, though as you will see in the performance section below, it doesn’t exactly help the J1 offer a smooth experience. Samsung’s phones are popular (or infamous, depending on how you look at it) for having a lot of additional functionality over what Android offers by default, but most of it is missing on the Galaxy J1. In fact, the J1 doesn’t even come with Samsung’s music app – it only has Google Play Music, and it’s probably because the TouchWiz Music app was a bit too heavy for the phone to handle.. A trip into the settings menu reveals a very short list of options.. Apart from a page for managing the dual SIM cards and the Ultra Power Saving Mode feature, there’s nothing that stands out here. You might take that as a sign that Samsung is cutting down on bloatware, but it’s pretty much the low-end nature of the phone that’s the reason for the lack of too many additional features.. Performance on the Galaxy J1 is bad. There is no other word for it – you’re better off buying Samsung’s Tizen-powered Z1 and living without any apps than getting the J1. From the first boot of the phone, things were constantly slow to happen. There were stutters throughout the interface, with animations not at all smooth most of the time. Apps were slow to launch as well, though this was more an issue on some of Samsung’s inbuilt apps rather than third-party ones. The phone got two software updates after the first boot, but neither was able to do anything to fix the performance issues.. The lack of RAM (there’s only 512MB RAM on the model we’re testing) is clearly the biggest problem. here – Android KitKat might be designed to run on phones as low as 512MB of RAM, but Samsung has clearly not understood that that fact is only true when you’re talking about stock Android, not a version of Android that has been customized and bloated up by manufacturers. 1GB of RAM is absolutely necessary on smartphones these days, and it’s just shameful that the Galaxy J1 offers such a slow experience, at a time when budget smartphones have reached such a high level of quality.. Gaming performance is thankfully above average on the J1. Temple Run 2 ran without any lag or stutter, though Minion Rush – another game where you have to run endlessly – wasn’t very smooth. The phone should let you play basic games with ease, but just don’t throw any title that has a lot of graphics and things happening on the screen at the phone.. Call quality on the Galaxy J1 is below average. The sound from the other side comes out with quite a bit of compression, which made understanding the other person hard at times.. Call volume on the earpiece wasn’t very loud either, though thankfully my own voice was pretty clear at the other end.. As for network performance, I didn’t really notice anything out of the ordinary. Calls never dropped, but like most low-end phones, the J1 did struggle to find as good a signal in areas with low network strength as costlier devices. Overall, call quality isn’t a strong suit for the Galaxy J1.. The audio quality on this thing is also nothing to write home about. The loudspeaker is a bit too light on bass and a bit too light on the treble, but the sound coming out of it sounds pretty good. On the flip side, the speaker can’t get very loud. Oddly, playing audio tracks in the music player was louder than playing audio on YouTube, which suggests the phone isn’t that good at files with lower bitrates.. On headphones, it’s a similar story. The provided earphones just do their job and nothing more, though they get considerably louder than the loudspeaker, which is a given. You can’t really expect high audio performance on a phone in the budget segment, and the Galaxy J1 does nothing to buck. The Galaxy J1 has a 1,850 mAh battery under the hood. That’s just 10 mAh less than the battery on the high-end Galaxy Alpha, but is naturally able to last longer as it doesn’t have too many powerful internals to handle. I easily got a full day of battery life on the J1 with average usage, including using two SIM cards at the same time. Samsung has also built in its Ultra Power Saving Mode, so you can certainly rest assured that the J1 will not be letting you down as far as battery endurance is concerned.. The Galaxy J1 might have been a good device if it had launched back in 2013, but at this point in time, there isn’t really a sufficient reason for why you would want to spend your money on it. Except for the cameras and battery life, the J1 doesn’t really offer anything worthy of its $120 price tag. For lesser cash, you can buy smartphones like the Redmi 1S, Moto E, various Android One phones, a few offerings from Lenovo, and a few other devices.. Okay, so some of these might not be available outside of India or China (and a couple of other emerging markets), but still, buying the Galaxy J1 doesn’t make any sense unless all you want is a phone that you will use for calls. But then, if that’s going to be your use case, then even the Samsung Z1 is a better option. It might lack the app selection and support of Android, but it’s priced considerably lower while offering a similar user experience.. The Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge represent a new Samsung, one that’s ready to do all it can to. reclaim the glory it has lost in the past year or so. But the Galaxy J1 is a sign that the company still hasn’t changed enough. Maybe some day the Korean manufacturer will come up with budget smartphones that are actually modern and current and not something that would have been okay a year or so ago, but for now, you’re better off looking elsewhere for your budget smartphone fix..

Last month I purchased Samsung Galaxy J1 Ace(White, 4 GB) smart phone on the recommendation of one of my very close friend. This phone very really works well. It includes a reliable operating system installed in it and is powered by a very fast and efficient processor in it.. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 1 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. There’s a newer version of this phone in the US exclusive to Verizon. It seems to be much better spec-wise. It has 4G LTE, 5.0.2 Lollipop, a 1.2 GHz quad-core processor, and 1GB of RAM. You should consider reviewing that version of the phone if you have the chance.. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 1 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. “Cheap smartphone” market is flooded with very bad units, this one not being an exception (it can be bought at 100 EUR.) If you want a decent smartphone, these days you have to spend more than 400 EUR. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. I strongly disagree on 2nd part. You can actually buy decent phones starting from 150/200 EUR. You can get decent 720p screen, 2gb ram and a Snapdragon 615 for that price (i have a ZTE Blade S6). A few years back, it was either flagships or low range phones, now you can get good midrange if you look for them (Samsung A series are overpriced)..

Samsung hasn’t said anything, and given how the J1 just seems to have been created as an afterthought and given its weak hardware, there probably won’t be a Lollipop update.. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. The US variant of this phone (available on Verizon) has 5.0.2 Lollipop. It also has better specs than the version reviewed here (quad-core processor, 1GB RAM, 4G LTE).. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. Galaxy X foldable smartphone won’t be a gimmick, says Samsung CEO. Galaxy S9 super slow-motion feature will be available on other devices.

BASED ON 995 RATING(S). 15 Apr 2016 By Abhinav Arora On flipkart.com. An OKAY option for this price.. The phone has all basic android features.nnBATTERY & CHARGERn- I have very low usage, Get only 5-8 incoming SMSs, and the battery lasts for about 24-30 hours. It has a low power (0.7 amp) charger. If you try to charge it with a normal Samsung galaxy white charger it will harm the battery, as those are (1 amp or higher). SO, I have to carry two samsung chargers. One for my Note Edge & one for this phone.nnRAM & MEMORYn- It's Okay. I installed Whatsapp, and a couple of more apps, and the phone still runs fine on phone memory. nnCAMERA & SCREEN RESOLUTIONn- Camera is hopeless. Screen Resolution is Ok if you just want a phone for Basic uses & basic apps. You cannot set different walpapers for Home & Lock Screens. Whichever wallpaper youuse, it will show on both Lock & Home screens.nnDESIGN & HANDLINGn- Design is Nice for this price. Especially, for the Black color variant.
