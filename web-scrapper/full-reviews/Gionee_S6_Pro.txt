Does the 'pro' tag in the Gionee S6 Pro justify itself?. The smartphone market is flooded with options in the budget and flagship price segments, and more often than not the purchase decisions can be definitive based on brand perception or the success (or the lack thereof) of the previous iterations of models. However, the mid-range segment is one where the buyer faces a lot of confusion as the lines are very blurred between what’s good and what should be good. The Gionee S6 Pro, complete with a premium finish and some UI goodies is contending for the buyers’ attention in this space.. Pro is definitely one very good-looking phone. The metal unibody design not just looks classy, but also feels very well built. The specifications are designed to perform well, and in our tests, they did just that. The Gionee S6 Pro doesn’t score mind-numbing scores in the benchmark tests, but in real world usage it does deliver on what one expects it to. It handles everyday tasks very well, performs well in gaming, and the Gionee S6 Pro can safely be called an all-rounder. The problem, with the Gionee S6 Pro, however, is that it is priced a little too high if compared to the peers in the segment. The Lenovo Zuk Z2 Plus, for instance, is available for less but packs a much better processor and the performance too is a couple of notches above the Gionee S6 Pro..

Gionee S6 Pro is the latest mid-range smartphone from Chinese smartphone maker that will compete with Asus Zenfone 3 and OnePlus 3.

Sridevi funeral LIVE UPDATES: The actor died of accidental drowning, says forensic report Encouraging the future geniuses: Easy science experiments to do with your kids Sridevi dies at 54, leaves India in shock. Gionee – the name is now iconic with smartphones equivalent to power banks. Gionee has been pioneering big battery smartphones for quite sometime now. The company’s last offering in the Marathon series has a massive battery of 6020mAh battery, enough to keep your phone alive for days of continuous 4G use. But is the battery the most significant selling point anymore? Well, the trend does suggest otherwise.. More and more OEMs have adopted features like ergonomic design, decent specifications paired with generous battery. At the end of the day, OEMs are moving from smartphones lasting days on single charge to one’s lasting two days with a really nice design. Gionee which has played the battery card for far too long is also moving in that direction.. While the Marathon series continues to focus of battery life, Gionee’s S series puts emphasis on design and performance over battery life. Gionee S8 was an incredible smartphone in terms of design and S6s tried to woo selfie fans. With S6 Pro, Gionee is trying to appeal to pro users, but does it justify the tag? We find out in our review.. Specs: 5.5-inch (1080x1920p, ~401 ppi) IPS LCD display | 1.8GHz Octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor | 4GB RAM | 64GB storage | 13MP rear camera + 8MP front | Li-Ion 3130 mAh battery | Amigo 3.2 OS | Gionee S6 Pro full specs. Gionee S6 Pro is one of the best looking smartphones out there in the market. Our review unit came in gold colour trim with elegant use of metal and blue colour band running across the chamfered edges. The Gionee logo sits below the camera sensor now and it looks more like a dimple than the real logo. The antenna bands are akin to iPhone 6s and 6s Plus (we can’t really complain) and overall the design is very minimalistic and meaningful.. One reason for getting this phone has to be the performance, justifying the pro branding. Gionee S6 Pro is powered by MediaTek MTK6755 processor, widely known as Helio P10. The processor is an octa-core model, which is not a benchmark shattering chipset but gets the right combination of performance and efficiency.. There are four low power cores and four high power cores, which always translated into really smooth multitasking.. I keep multiple apps running in the background and often keep switching between them. I never observed any lag or slow-loading screen on this phone.. The performance is very well taken care of in the graphics department too. I tried playing my usual favourites Real Racing 3 and Asphalt 8: Airborne, the load times were faster and games rendered really fast. Thanks to Mali-T860 GPU, this phone does get smartphone gaming right.. Like I mentioned before, Gionee S6 Pro’s USP is not battery life but it still manages to perform reasonably well. I would rate the battery life as average with a screen on time of nearly 3 hours with heavy use and nearly five hours on moderate usage. And once I even got a screen on time of 7 hours and 38 minutes before the battery reached 14 per cent and I plugged it in for charging.. On one occasion when I was out attending a launch event and the 4G connection kept struggling, the battery drained significantly faster. I am convinced this phone will easily last one full day for heavy users and leave some juice behind for average users, which is exactly what you should expect from a mid-range smartphone right now.. Gionee S6 Pro doesn’t have the brightest or sharpest display out there but it certainly delivers the right balance. Under direct sunlight, the auto brightness works extensively to make the text sharper and brighter, but I feel OnePlus 3 holds an edge when it comes to best display on a mid-range premium smartphone.. Gionee S6 Pro’s home button also doubles as fingerprint scanner and it is really quick. It is not easy to get the home button to work as fingerprint scanner and here, the response is just instantaneous. Gionee has also added gesture feature to the fingerprint which exposes an Edge Bar with a slight swipe. The Edge Bar works very much like the edge screen on Samsung ’s Galaxy S7 Edge. It gives quick access to apps and works really well.. Gionee has always managed to pack great cameras with its smartphones. In the case of Gionee S6 Pro, the camera is cool but not consistent. I prefer a smartphone camera that works well in the auto mode and if I need to tinker with the setting then let the result be as good as Huawei P9. With Gionee S6 Pro, I found the camera performed really well in the Macro setting, but the regular pictures always felt underwhelming.. There is an option to shoot in HDR mode but it was underexposing the background while getting the highlights right. I tried shooting wide range of subjects and while the results were good, but definitely not the best among smartphones I have tested.. Gionee S6 Pro is a well designed smartphone, but it is not foolproof. I managed to slip the device while pulling out from my pocket and as one would expect, the chamfered metal edge got dented, and the blue colour band started peeling out.. Gionee S6 Pro runs Amigo 3.2 based on Android Marshmallow. The good part is that the phone’s UI skin is not too heavy, but the accessibility is bad. It takes few clicks more than normal Android to get into the battery setting. It is hard to find something like software update or set up a new Google account.. Gionee S6 Pro is an excellent smartphone in terms of design, but it still didn’t convince me as a great overall smartphone. It delivers decent battery life, the camera is not exceptional and the display is adequately bright.. At Rs 23,999, Gionee S6 Pro is a decent option but it pales in comparison with OnePlus 3, which sets the benchmark for a great mid-range premium smartphone..

Does the 'pro' tag in the Gionee S6 Pro justify itself?. Gionee S6 Pro Design & Build. Gionee S6 Pro Software & UI. The Gionee S6 pro comes with a 3,130mAh battery, almost as big (if not slightly bigger) than most flagships in the market, across price segments. In our usage tests, we figured that the Gionee S6 Pro’s battery can last for about almost an entire work day. In the days when we used the Gionee S6 Pro as our primary phone, using it between 4G and Wi-Fi, we needed to charge it only after getting home late in the evening – our work day would start typically around 10 am with a 100% charge in the device.. On the PCMark Battery benchmark, we got a rating of 7 hours and 5 minutes, and around 9 hours of usage on the video-loop test. This, in our opinion is a decent battery life. Sure, with a 3130 mAh battery, the Gionee S6 Pro could have retained more charge, but we hope that software updates in the future would fix the optimization.. Gionee S6 Pro Design & Build.

OS: Android (6.0), Gionee Amigo UI. Dimensions: 6.02 x 2.96 x 0.30 inches (153 x 75.3 x 7.6 mm). Weight: 6.00 oz (170 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Macro mode, Night mode. Features: Time-lapse video, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Octa-core, 1800 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 28.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 20.8 days (500 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 23.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 21.7 days (520 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Stand-by time (4G): 15.4 days (370 hours) the average is 23 days (549 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Type-C 1.0 Reversible Connector (OTG support). In a market saturated with mid-range smartphones, Gionee has come up with yet another overkill mid-range phone. By the looks of it, the phone seems both premium and powerful. The newly announced S6 Pro is the successor to the last year’s Gionee S6 , which was a pretty good phone for its price.

Roydon Cerejo , 03 November 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Gionee S6 Pro features a Helio P10 SoC with 4GB of RAM. Build quality, battery life and the display are good but little else is. The Gionee S6 Pro is priced at Rs. Gionee’s portfolio continues to expand with its latest instalment called the S6 Pro. The company first debuted the S6 in India back in February, and has been iterating on it ever since. recently reviewed the S6s , which is a version of the S6 that focused primarily on selfies. The new S6 Pro is also a ‘selfie-focused’ smartphone but with more power under the hood. Both the Gionee S6 and Gionee S6s were pretty average offerings, with the only consistent positives being their battery life and build quality. Also, considering these phones were priced little above Rs. 15,000, we weren’t expecting great results either. However, the S6 Pro is priced in the upper mid-range segment at Rs. 23,999, which puts it in direct competition with the likes of the Xiaomi Mi 5 ( Review ), Moto Z Play. ( Review ), HTC One A9 ( Review ), and Asus Zenfone 3 (ZE520KL). Is the S6 Pro worth the premium it commands? Let’s find out.. Gionee S6 Pro design and build The new model's design language has stayed relatively true to that of the original S6, with minor tweaks here and there. Chamfered edges along the sides add to its visual appeal. According to Gionee, the chassis of the S6 Pro is nearly all-metal, which lends it a sturdy feel and makes it looks quite premium. The phone is slim and doesn’t feel too heavy. The fit and finish of everything is mostly good, except for the home button, whose edges feel a bit rough. The earpiece is also placed a bit higher than usual, which ends up looking a bit odd.. The display offers good enough brightness for outdoor use,. and the resolution is high enough for sharp images and text. It’s a 5.5-inch full HD IPS panel with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. There are two capacitive buttons below for navigation but no backlighting for these keys. You do get a notification LED beside the front camera on the top. The left side houses the hybrid Dual-SIM tray while the power and volume buttons sit on the right. The tactile feedback is good and placement is ergonomic. There’s a headphones socket at the top and. a USB Type-C port at the bottom, with a single mono speaker just beside it. Around the back, we have the 13-megapixel camera and single-LED flash. The circular indent in the metal frame below is only for Gionee's logo, as the fingerprint sensor is integrated into the home button. Rather than having the IMEI number etched onto the metal, Gionee has resorted to a simple sticker, which is quite an eyesore.. The S6 Pro ships with a 10W wall adapter, USB cable, headset, screen guard, and a simple silicon case. The quality of the accessories is good and they felt quite durable. Overall, ergonomics are good and single-handed use is possible to an extent thanks to the slim bezels. The phone can get a bit slippery when you hold it but it isn' too bad.. Gionee S6 Pro specifications and features The phone is powered by the octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 SoC, which is a bit more powerful than the usual MT6753 SoC that’s commonly used. You also get 4GB of RAM and a generous 64GB of storage. The latter can be expanded by using (up to) a 128GB microSD card instead of a second SIM. Other specifications of the Gionee S6. include Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi b/g/n, GPS, FM radio, and USB OTG. Being a ‘Pro’ version of the S6, we were expecting Wi-Fi 802.11ac and NFC too but sadly, neither is present. The phone supports 4G LTE with VoLTE on Band 3, 5, and 40. Just like the S6s, the S6 Pro runs Android Marshmallow but with Gionee’s Amigo 3.2 user interface. This isn't one of our favourite Android forks, and this version doesn’t seem to be much different from what we've seen before. It’s a single-layered UI so all your app icons. are spread across multiple home screens. The notifications shade will only show you notifications since toggle switches for functions such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. are placed in another drawer, which can be accessed by swiping upwards from the bottom of the screen. In the Settings app, you’ll find Edge Bar, which is a vertical list of app shortcuts which can be summoned by swiping either left of right on the home button. You can add up to six shortcuts here. The ‘Split screen’ feature lets you reply to an incoming message when watching a video without having to leave the video player. ‘Suspend button’ is a slightly misleading name, and in fact. it’s nothing more than a floating carousel of shortcuts, much like the iPhone’s Assistive Touch feature and Xiaomi’s Quick Ball.. This being Amigo UI, you get a whole bunch of preinstalled apps. All third-party apps can be uninstalled but of course, those from Gionee cannot. There are trial games, popular shopping apps. and social apps – all of which can be removed if not needed. Uninstalling apps is a fuss-free process, which we appreciate. The Abroad Service app is a bit like TripCase, which lets you manage your travel itinerary. The phone also ships with Gionee’s own VR launcher app which works with most Google Cardboard VR headsets. We tried it with the OnePlus Loop VR headset, and it worked pretty well. By default, there's only a video player for 360-degree videos but you can find more VR apps and games from an app called G Store. Sadly, these apps aren’t added to the VR launcher app so you can’t access them with the headset on. The quality of games and apps on G Store is average at best, as most. You’ll need to keep taking the phone out of the headset to navigate through the menus. Gionee S6 Pro performance Even with its heavy skin, general performance is good. We didn’t encounter any noticeable lag or stutter in the system animations or when switching between apps. up when using the camera and the entire body can get quite hot at times, but this wasn’t a consistent issue. GPU performance is lower than that of the comparably positioned Snapdragon 625 SoC. We got scores of 47,360 points in AnTuTu, 17fps in GFXbench, and 6281 in 3DMark Extreme. The fingerprint sensor works decently well for unlocking the device.. The S6 Pro does well in media playback. High-bitrate videos play just fine and audio quality is pretty good with the bundled headset. However, the speaker is a bit weak and sound is quite tinny at high volumes. The stock audio and video players do a good job at sorting your media files and also provide DTS audio boost, which can be toggled on or off. The lack of PDAF or laser autofocus for the main 13-megapixel camera means that it's more difficult to get sharp, blur-free shots than with other phones. could have been a lot better, and it actually gets worse in low light. Landscapes shots lack details and colours, even in daylight. Photos viewed on the phone’s display don't look too bad, but problems are revealed on a larger screen.. We even had trouble getting good detail with macro shots - even if subjects seem sharp and in focus while framing, the final picture is quite average. Low-light shots are below par too, with poor detail and lots of noise.. Tap to see full-sized Gionee S6 Pro camera samples. Gionee is touting its ‘screen flash’ feature for selfies but the truth is. it's simply too weak to light up your whole face (let alone a group selfie), and the quality of the 8-megapixel front camera is nothing to shout about. The camera interface is thankfully easy to use, with tons to options to explore. There are a whole bunch of shooting modes, including Pro, slow-motion, panorama, etc. Video recording tops out at 1080p and the quality is again. On the whole, we feel that the cameras could have been much better. The 3130mAh battery lasted for 10 hours and 13 minutes in our video loop test, which is good. With regular usage, we were easily able to go about a little more than an entire day on a single charge. There’s no fast charging here but the high wattage adapter manages to fill the battery completely in a couple of hours. Verdict The upper mid-range segment of smartphones is generally where we find good all-rounders. Since these devices aren’t built to fit a tight budget, manufacturers can afford to put in some quality components to make them excel in a few departments but still keep users happy with the rest. Gionee’s previous S6 models have been good at battery life and build quality but haven't offered anything special in other areas. Sadly, nothing seems to have changed with the S6 Pro. Apart from build quality, battery life and the display, there’s nothing that would make you pick this model over similarly priced ones from Lenovo, Xiaomi, Asus or HTC. The cameras continue to be the weakest link with both front and back ones offering mediocre performance in most lighting conditions. The phone also tends to heat up when using the camera. Gionee has missed out on details like Wi-Fi 802.11ac, NFC, backlit capacitive buttons, fast charging, and perhaps a dedicated slot for the microSD card.. Overall, we'd recommend giving this one a pass.. For the latest smartphone launches by Samsung, Nokia, Sony, Asus, and other MWC 2018 announcements, visit our MWC hub ..
