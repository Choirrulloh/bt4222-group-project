Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Dual-camera (5-megapixel, 120-degree viewing angle), Autofocus. Software Features: Face detection, Voice activation, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Octa-core, 1140 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 5.66 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 10.8 days (260 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 6.83 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 10.8 days (260 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Stand-by time (4G): 11.2 days (270 hours) the average is 23 days (549 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: DLNA, Wireless screen share.

Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: NFC, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 15 Feb 2016. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

The LG X Cam looks to have one of the best cameras in the mid-tier. If LG can keep pricing reasonable I think it could be on to a winner.. The LG X Cam is one of two mid-range handsets launched by the South Korean firm at MWC 2016 , and as the name suggests the big talking point here centers round this handset's camera.. I always like to see flagship features cascaded down the smartphone tiers, and with the X Cam inheriting the LG G5 's camera smarts it lets it have a real USP in the crowded middle tier of the market.. Pricing is yet to be announced for the LG X Cam, and the release date is also not nailed down with LG saying it will debut in key markets in Asia, Europe and Latin America from March.. The X Cam's design is decidedly mid-range, with the all plastic body looking and feeling cheap, although it does feel solid and tapers to a 5.2mm thickness allowing it to fit nicely in the palm.. I got my hands on the grey (or as LG like to call it, Titan Silver) X Cam, but it will also be available in white, gold and pink gold.. The power/lock key is located on the right, with volume and the tray for a SIM card and microSD card on the left. The buttons are easy enough to reach, but they sit almost flush with the chassis and I found they could be a little tricky to find at times.. You'll be thankful for that microSD slot too, as the X Cam comes with 16GB of internal storage which can fill up fast if you really put the camera on the back to the test and download some intensive games.. Round the back there is a noticeable similarity between the X Cam and G5, with a large camera bump housing two sensors along with a flash and laser autofocus. There's no fingerprint sensors below on the LG X Cam though.. Back to the front and a full HD 5.2-inch display dominates the X Cam, giving you a nice big viewfinder for those double cameras on the rear. I found the screen to be bright and clear and colors were strong, although not as vibrant as Samsung's Super AMOLED displays.. On screen and the X Cam runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow, although LG has coated it in its own light UI. One of the major things LG has done here is remove the app tray - an occurrence which is happening all the more often, especially from Chinese manufacturers.. This could irk some Android fans, but LG's done a good job with its overlay and it feels fresh and clean. It also performed smoothly, and with an octa-core processor and 2GB of RAM under the hood there's more than enough power for most smartphone based activities.. Putting the focus back on the camera though, and on the back the main 13MP snapper is joined by a 5MP wide-angle lens allowing you to get more in your shots, although you will sacrifice image quality.. This helps the X Cam stand out from what is a rather bland middle market, and it offers something rather more interesting than standard cameraphones.. Fire up the camera app and it's easy to switch between the two lenses, with a nice zoom in, zoom out animation to let you know you've changed. And I can say that switching to the wide angle option definitely puts more in your shot.. Shutter speed was reasonable, and the images I snapped on the LG booth looked pretty good, but they're not as polished as those from the LG G5.. For those addicted to selfies, LG's included an 8MP front facing snapper too, with all the bells and whistles including beauty mode and gesture shutter. The latter allows you to hold your hand up and then make a fist to trigger a three second count down timer.. LG's also packed a 2,520mAh battery into the X Cam, although I'm wary that this phone could struggle to see out a full day on a single charge. A sizeable full HD display, punchy processor and feature which encourages you to take lots of photos could see the battery take a beating.. I'll reserve judgment on battery life for our full review though, where we'll put the LG X Cam through its paces.. The LG X Cam looks to have one of the best cameras in the middle of the market and as long as LG can keep the pricing reasonable I think it could be on to a winner here.. It's running the latest version of Android, there's expandable storage and while LG may have removed the app draw I found the interface was still pleasing.. What is a hands on review?. 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

The modular G5 isn’t the only phone LG has brought with it to MWC 2016. The Korean brand has also unveiled a new ‘X’ series, with each device specialising in a certain area.. The LG X Cam, as you can probably guess, is all about the camera. But does this approach of giving each one a flagship feature actually work? Let’s take a look and see.. 1) Dual cameras on the back. The biggest feature for the LG X Cam is its camera set-up, and in some ways it’s quite similar to the flagship G5’s.. Instead of just one sensor, the X Cam has both 13- and 5-megapixel versions next to each on the back. Like the G5, this extra sensor can be used to add some depth to your shots and make things a little wider.. It certainly doesn’t function as well as its flashier brother, though. Switching between modes is slow and autofocus takes a while to lock on to targets.. 2) Specs straight out of the mid-range, but a strong screen. While the majority of the specs for the LG X Cam are far from exciting – 1.1GHz octa-core processor, 2GB of RAM – it does have a really nice, 1080p 5.2-inch display. Viewing angles are great and it wasn’t completely ruined by the bright trade show spotlights shining directly on it, which is always a good sign.. There is only 16GB of internal storage, though, which is far too low these days.. 3) Android 6.0.1 with LG’s skin. The LG X Cam comes with Android 6.0.1 out of the box – something which can’t be said of every budget phone. But don’t come here expecting a near-stock Android experience.. LG’s skin seems to have grown slightly more overbearing this year and LG’s taken the decision to completely remove the app tray – a move that’s pretty common with Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei. I’m against it, but even Google’s been rumoured to be ditching it from Android N later in the year.. 4) Thin and light, but quite plasticky. Considering the X Cam has a 5.2-inch display, it still manages to remain a fairly compact device. It’s thin and weighs next to nothing. Seriously, when I picked it up I almost felt there was no battery inside.. That lightness is achieved because there’s no metal here – instead the whole phone is constructed from slightly cheap-feeling plastic. There’s a bit too much flex here for my liking, and it has that almost hollow feeling when you tap it in the middle.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. When budget phones, such as the BQ Aquaris X5 and OnePlus X , manage to keep the price down and look good, it’s hard to give LG a free pass. Get a great deal on the LG G4 at Amazon. The 5.2-inch, 1080p display is surprisingly good. There’s a dual-camera set-up on the back: a 13MP main sensor paired with a 5MP one. Under the dual cameras is an LED flash. It’s certainly a thin phone, but it feels cheap and overly plastic. LG has yet to confirm the price and release date for the X Cam at the time of writing.. The X Cam has a lot of the parts that make up a good budget phone. It’s got a nice 1080p display, a decent camera and the latest version of Android. But I’m not convinced LG’s approach to cherrypicking a headline feature and building a phone based solely around that is a good idea.. The budget smartphone market is not only crowded these days, but it’s also very competitive. LG couldn’t confirm to me what the retail price of the X Cam was going to be, but it needs to be priced well to stand a chance.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

Marcus Herbrich ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 08/26/2016. Android Smartphone Touchscreen. LG's latest product line with an "X" in its name combines mid-range smartphones with handpicked features that are normally found in the smartphone premium range. LG's X Cam stands out with a special "x-tra" in the camera section. Find out whether the camera module's quality is also "x-tra" good..

Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here .. Like the present G5 flagship smartphone by the Korean manufacturer, LG's X Cam module features a rear-facing dual-primary camera with two modules: A 13 MP primary camera (75 Â° standard angle) and a 5 MP wide angle module. Beyond that, it has a high-resolution front-facing camera (8 MP) for selfies.. The mid-range smartphone also sports a 2500 mAh battery besides a MediaTek MT6753 octa-core processor alongside 2 GB of RAM. The internal eMMC storage has a capacity of 16 GB, which can be expanded via a micro-SD card.. At an RRP of 299 Euros (~$334), LG's X Cam finds itself in one of the most competitive smartphone sectors and the list of potential rivals is correspondingly long. We use Lenovo's Moto G4 , ZTE's Blade V7 , OnePlus' X , and Huawei's P9 Lite for comparison in this test. The "big brother" LG's G5 serves as the test reference..

Although LG's X Cam looks as if it is made of aluminum at first glance, the mid-range smartphone's casing is plastic. LG's X Cam makes a somewhat lower quality impression than devices with a glass ( OnePlus X ) or metal ( ZTE Blade V7 ) back cover. The edges around the 5.2-inch display look relatively wide. This is also reflected in the screen-surface ratio of almost 69%. Nevertheless, the just 6.9-millimeter slim smartphone is pleasant to hold with its weight of 118 grams.. The plastic casing's stability is satisfactory. Despite the slim build, wave formation only develops on the screen when high pressure is applied on the back. The incorporated plastic keys provide a good pressure point and are easy to access.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. The 16 GB eMMC storage is not very lush in view of the focus on camera. The user has approximately 10.15 GB for personal use after deducting the operating system. At least it is possible to expand the storage via a micro-SD card by up to 2 TB, and moving compatible apps to the SD card (App2SD) is also supported.. A micro-USB 2.0 port on the handset's underside is present for recharging the smartphone. It is not possible to connect external storage devices via USB OTG. A status LED for notifications and NFC chip are further features of LG's smartphone. LG's X Cam also supports wireless media streaming: Miracast, Wi-Fi Direct, Android Beam, and DLNA. Transmitting content to an external monitor wirelessly to a Sony Android TV functioned without issues in the test.. As to system software, LG relies on a modified user interface based on Google's latest Android version 6 Marshmallow. The manufacturer's user interface hardly looks like Google's stock Android. The app and folder design, as well as the missing app drawer (ex-factory), correspond to the Korean manufacturer's design language. The animations are also very prominent, which does not really contribute to the system's subjective performance. The latter can be disabled in the developer options. Quick access to camera and notes (Capture+) are present. Furthermore, the handset can be unlocked via the "Double-Tap-to-Wake" gesture.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

LG's X Cam features Bluetooth version 4.2 and NFC (near-field communication) for wireless communication between mobile devices. Beyond that, Wi-Fi standards 802.11 b/g/n are onboard. The reception quality of the installed Wi-Fi module is decent, and the attenuation of just below -42 dBm in the (Telekom Speedport, W921V) router's direct vicinity is low. The average data transfer rates of 50 Mbit/s (transmit) and 42 Mbit/s (receive) at a distance of 1 meter to our Linksys EA8500 reference router are on a typical level for entry handsets.. The LTE smartphone accesses mobile Internet with up to 150 Mbit/s in download and 50 Mbit/s in upload (LTE Cat.4). The 800, 1800, 2600 LTE frequencies, as well as quad-band GSM and quad-band UMTS, are supported. The reception in the German D network was satisfactory in a big city..

Outdoor tracking was possible with an accuracy of approximately 2 meters. Setting up a sufficiently strong satellite signal for finding us indoors was also possible. In our practical test where the mid-range smartphone's GPS module and Garmin's Edge 500 GPS bike computer both log a route simultaneously, LG's X Cam deviated by approximately 300 meters on the roughly 12-kilometer route. The achieved accuracy is comparatively poor for a mid-range handset.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

LG uses its own phone app in the X Cam model. It offers common features, such as a call list and integrated phone book.. The earpiece's sound quality was unsatisfactory in the test. Our contact's voice output sounded distorted and had an echo. We performed the test calls with Skype and via the German D-network (Vodafone). In return, the microphone's voice quality was good and ensured a sufficient intelligibility at our end.. Like LG's G5, the front-facing camera in LG's X Cam has a high resolution of 8 megapixels (2448x3264 pixels, 4:3). The lens provides satisfactory results in good light conditions. It does not have an autofocus, but it offers the option of illuminating image areas differently by tapping the screen.. The dual-camera module consists of a 75 Â° standard angle camera with a resolution of 13 megapixels (4160x3120 pixels) and a 5-MP camera (2560x1920 pixels) with a wide angle of 120 Â°. It has an aperture of f/2.0. Photos shot in good light conditions are compelling for a mid-range handset. However, they look a bit blurry (scene 1 & 2: surroundings and woods) compared with LG's G5. Furthermore, the dynamic range in the photos is too low, which strongly dims the photos in extremely different light conditions. High image noise and a very evident blurriness increases in shots taken in low-light conditions (scene 2: street). Photos with the 5-MP wide angle camera look somewhat pale and low-contrast. Also, the lens' low-light performance is worse than that of the standard-angle primary camera.. LG's X Cam records videos in a maximum quality of 1080p at 30 FPS.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. In addition to the smartphone, a user's manual, USB cable, and modular power supply for recharging the battery were found in the box. The manufacturer also included an in-ear headphone for LG's X Cam.. According to the warranty card, the manufacturer's warranty is 24 months from date of purchase.. The usual three Android onscreen buttons for "back", "multitasking", and "home screen" are used for controlling the handset. The capacitive touchscreen responds quickly and reliably. LG's own "Smart Keyboard" is preloaded ex-factory as an input option.. The 5-inch LC display in LG's X Cam has a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, which results in a pixel density of approximately 424 PPI. The available resolution ensures a sharp reproduction of displayed content in routine use.. Although the screen's maximum brightness of 362 cd/mÂ² is sufficiently bright for most application scenarios, the rivals clearly outperform it. We determined a very similar rate of 363 cd/mÂ² in our measurement of equally distributed bright and dark areas (APL 50).. 348 cd/m² 347 cd/m² 341 cd/m² 343 cd/m² 362 cd/m² 343 cd/m² 359 cd/m² 345 cd/m² 346 cd/m². 94 % Center on Battery: 362. cd/m²) ΔE Color 6.8 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 8.4 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.22.

Both the contrast ratio of 1448:1 and the black level of 0.25 cd/mÂ² (APL 50: 0.26 cd/mÂ²) are on a very good level for a mid-range handset. The analysis using a photospectrometer and CalMAN software shows relatively low shifts in color (6.8) and grayscale (8.4) reproduction. The measured color temperature of 8242 Kelvin is a bit too cool (ideal value: 6500 Kelvin) and a minor bluish tint is visible.. CalMAN Colorspace (target color space: sRGB). CalMAN ColorChecker (target color space: sRGB). CalMAN Saturation Sweeps (target color space: sRGB). CalMAN Grayscale (target color space: sRGB). The very good contrast ratio of 1448:1 also ensures good legibility of the liquid crystal display outdoors. However, the screen's relatively low maximum brightness makes it difficult to recognize content in direct sunlight. The viewing angles are IPS-typical and content is displayed fairly color accurate even in very flat viewing angles..

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. MediaTek's MT6753 installed in LG's X Cam is an ARM SoC (system on a chip) built in 28 nanometers and has 8 CPU cores based on the 64-bit capable Cortex A53 architecture. The configuration of an octa-core SoC and 2 GB of DDR3 RAM mostly ensures a smooth system and browser performance in routine use. However, the animations of LG's UI were almost annoyingly slow in our opinion. Compared with the Qualcomm competition ( Lenovo Moto G4 , OnePlus X ), LG's X Cam is outperformed clearly in most synthetic benchmarks - Huawei's P9 Lite also offers a better processor performance than LG's handset.. The speed of the 16 GB eMMC flash memory is in line with the determined SoC performance of LG's X Cam. With exception of the read speed, the access rates clearly lag behind the other mid-range rivals. The micro-SD card slot also does not achieve the performance level of the comparison devices.

The Mali-T720 MP4 graphics unit integrated in MediaTek's MT6753 has four clusters that clock at up to 600 MHz. The Mali GPU renders current games from the Android Play Store, such as N.O.V.A. 3 or Need for Speed No Limits , smoothly. The touchscreen also responded quickly and accurately in the gaming test.. The temperatures of LG's X Cam are distributed quite evenly in idle mode. While we measured 36.8 Â°C on the front, the back presented a slightly lower maximum surface temperature of 34.1 Â°C in the test. The temperatures climbed particularly strongly in the casing's front upper third in load conditions. Since these areas remain largely untouched when holding the smartphone normally and the rates measured on LG's handset are relatively low, the waste heat will not be noticed unfavorably in routine use.. 41.2 °C 38.5 °C 37.8 °C. 41.6 °C 39.1 °C 38.7 °C. 40.1 °C 40.3 °C 39.7 °C.

The rear-sided speaker is sufficiently loud with almost 85 dB(A), but the playback quality makes a tinny impression when increasing the volume. The sound impression is not really very linear in the audible range - basses are not perceptible. The playback quality of the mono speaker in LG's handset could not convince us.. The 3.5-mm jack can be used alternatively for a better sound experience.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 32.8 32.4 32.8 25 31.7 31.3 31.7 31 29.2 31.7 29.2 40 35.6 26 35.6 50 36 39.4 36 63 31.9 36.2 31.9 80 27.8 28.6 27.8 100 25.1 25.4 25.1 125 23.1 21.3 23.1 160 25.7 23.3 25.7 200 22.2 22.5 22.2 250 23.8 22.4 23.8 315 33 21.3 33 400 41.8 18.4 41.8 500 51.2 17.5 51.2 630 56.9 17.5 56.9 800 64.2 17.2 64.2 1000 72.4 16.8 72.4 1250 75.8 17.3 75.8 1600 73.3 17.4 73.3 2000 72.7 16.6 72.7 2500 71.2 17.3 71.2 3150 69.1 17.6 69.1 4000 69.3 17.6 69.3 5000 73.1 17.7 73.1 6300 76.6 17.4 76.6 8000 78.4 17.7 78.4 10000 73 17.9 73 12500 63.8 18.1 63.8 16000 60.6 18.1 60.6 SPL 85 29.8 85 N 56.9 1.3 56.9 median 64.2 LG X Cam median 17.7 median 64.2 Delta 17 1.6 17 33.6 37 32.4 33.6 38.3 39.6 31.3 38.3 30 38.4 31.7 30 31.3 38.8 26 31.3 35.8 40.8 39.4 35.8 31.6 32.6 36.2 31.6 26.1 27 28.6 26.1 27.8 25.3 25.4 27.8 25.1 24.2 21.3 25.1 24.2 25.4 23.3 24.2 22.9 21.6 22.5 22.9 22.2 19.2 22.4 22.2 24.6 19.8 21.3 24.6 31.6 20.5 18.4 31.6 45.6 28.9 17.5 45.6 58.4 41.8 17.5 58.4 67.7 52.1 17.2 67.7 71.9 56.3 16.8 71.9 73.4 57.1 17.3 73.4 72.1 56.2 17.4 72.1 73.8 56.4 16.6 73.8 73.9 57.3 17.3 73.9 76 59.2 17.6 76 76.8 59.7 17.6 76.8 74.1 56.7 17.7 74.1 72.1 53.7 17.4 72.1 71 52.5 17.7 71 74.4 55.6 17.9 74.4 73.7 54.7 18.1 73.7 61.5 42.1 18.1 61.5 85.3 68.3 29.8 85.3 57.3 20.5 1.3 57.3 median 71 ZTE Blade V7 median 52.5 median 17.7 median 71 17.9 14.1 1.6 17.9 32 37.8 32.4 32 34 30.4 31.3 34 30.6 28.9 31.7 30.6 30.8 31.5 26 30.8 34.8 30.3 39.4 34.8 28.3 28.9 36.2 28.3 30.5 29.3 28.6 30.5 28.5 25.8 25.4 28.5 33.1 25.9 21.3 33.1 45.9 34.8 23.3 45.9 51.9 42.1 22.5 51.9 56.1 46.4 22.4 56.1 58.7 50.6 21.3 58.7 63 54.2 18.4 63 66.8 58 17.5 66.8 70.7 61.8 17.5 70.7 72.1 65 17.2 72.1 75.5 67.2 16.8 75.5 74.8 66.1 17.3 74.8 75.8 67.1 17.4 75.8 77.4 68.4 16.6 77.4 78 69.4 17.3 78 76.8 67.5 17.6 76.8 75 66.4 17.6 75 71.4 62.4 17.7 71.4 70.7 61.9 17.4 70.7 70.3 60.4 17.7 70.3 67.1 58.3 17.9 67.1 63.7 54.1 18.1 63.7 58.6 51.4 18.1 58.6 86.6 77.8 29.8 86.6 66.4 39.2 1.3 66.4 median 70.3 Lenovo Moto G4 median 60.4 median 17.7 median 70.3 8.1 9.6 1.6 8.1 40.7 31.8 32.4 40.7 32.7 31.8 31.3 32.7 30.8 34.2 31.7 30.8 31.8 30.4 26 31.8 36.6 33.1 39.4 36.6 33.3 30.9 36.2 33.3 32.4 25 28.6 32.4 29.6 24.3 25.4 29.6 31.5 23.9 21.3 31.5 36.3 24.3 23.3 36.3 44.3 29.8 22.5 44.3 52.2 36.6 22.4 52.2 57.3 41.7 21.3 57.3 62.7 47.1 18.4 62.7 64.9 50.1 17.5 64.9 67 52.5 17.5 67 69.1 53.9 17.2 69.1 72 54.2 16.8 72 74 54.2 17.3 74 75.7 55.3 17.4 75.7 75.7 56.9 16.6 75.7 76.1 57.8 17.3 76.1 77 57.9 17.6 77 79.1 59.5 17.6 79.1 80.1 61.1 17.7 80.1 78.3 59.4 17.4 78.3 77.3 58.4 17.7 77.3 78.8 59.7 17.9 78.8 72.9 53.5 18.1 72.9 56.8 37 18.1 56.8 88.4 69.5 29.8 88.4 73.7 24.2 1.3 73.7 median 72 Huawei P9 Lite median 53.9 median 17.7 median 72 11.1 9.9 1.6 11.1 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

The power consumption of LG's X Cam is midfield among our comparison devices - only OnePlus' X presents a much better energy management. The very similarly configured ZTE's Blade V7 (SoC, display's pixel density) only has marginally better total consumption rates..

LG's X Cam achieves a good rate of 7 hours and 37 minutes in our practical Wi-Fi test (screen brightness set to 150 cd/mÂ², energy-saving profile). However, the 2500 mAh battery provides relatively short runtimes compared with the rivals from the medium price range.. LG's handset needs almost 3 hours to fully recharge a completely drained battery with the included 5-watt power supply..

Review sample courtesy of LG Germany. The X Cam mid-range model by LG scores in our test with a high-contrast Full HD IPS panel and its good handling. It is well-built but only offers a cheap-feeling plastic casing for this price range - the mid-range competition made of glass ( OnePlus' X ) or metal ( ZTE's Blade V7 ) make a much higher-quality impression.. Compared with the competition, LG's X Cam offers too little for its present price of approximately 280 Euros (~$313). However, it could still be an interesting alternative for some buyers when the market develops accordingly (price reduction) - but not really at the current purchase price in our opinion.. The handset's highlight and name-giving feature is the rear-facing dual-camera, comprised of a standard (75 Â°) and a 120 Â° wide angle module. The photo quality of both cameras is good but is clearly inferior to that of LG's G5 (also furnished with a dual-camera) - at an RRP of 300 Euros (~$335), LG certainly could have installed a lens equal to that of its current flagship handset as the mid-range smartphone's unique selling point.. Compromises also have to be made in processor performance. MediaTek's SoC in LG's X Cam cannot compete with the performance of other mid-range smartphones - the same is true for the speed of the 16 GB eMMC flash memory.

The battery life seems great, I'm getting through a whole day of usage and it charges quite quickly compared to other phones I've had. I think maybe people who normally buy £500/£600 phones would be disappointed with this one but for the price, as a mid-range phone, I can't fault it.

The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards.

Tengo el LG X Cam pero necesito sabdr como pasar mia aplicaciones y juegos ala memoria externa ya que la interna ya la tengo llena. Alguien sabe si se puede conectar al smart tv. Yo tengo el LG X CAM desde que salio al mercado, ningun problema. Hay personas que les dura muy poco las cosas. esque vaya manos que tgenemos algunos!. bueno mi opinion sobre el celuar lg x cam es muy muy mala experiencia por que resien voy utlizando seis meses y el celular falla y falla cuando ingreso alguna llamada o estor con internet la pantalla se paraliza y para que todo de nuevo se tiene que reiniciar cada ves que no funciona siempre es lo mismo ahora nunca mas comprare esa marca por que para mi es un gasto de dinero que cuesta todavia mucho no comprennnnnn..... Mi novia se compro ese smartphone, le duro 2 meses y el parlante dejo de funcionar. Quisiera dar una opinión rápida hacera del LG X Cam, llevo con este celular ya 1 año, y a decir verdad no eh tenido ninguna clase de problemas, siempre me ah funcionando perfecto, la única mini queja que podía decir seria la batería, siento que es muy poca y se descarga no tan rápido pero se nota, aun que hay que tomar en cuenta que llevo 1 años usándolo, llegue aquí buscando información sobre mi celular ya que no recordaba si tenia 4 o 8 núcleos.. Me compre un celu lg x cam el cual como propaganda desia que era una maravilla la verdad esuna porqueria por fondelo vean en peso por desconfigurarse la camara y despues dejo de funsionar el flach y ahora me borro toda la informacion se fue a cero. Lo voy a debolber es muy caro para lo malo que es me c@mbio a samsung nunca mas lg.. Hola buen dia soy del estado de mexico y en opinion del celular lg x cam difiero de todos los comentarios anteriores ya que a mi en lo personal no he tenido ningun problema con el equipo ni en cuestion de la bateria o q se me apague el equipo u otra cuestion,para mi ha sido un gran equipo celular y muy eficiente a pesar de que lo compre usaso y con defectos en el touch me refiero a que lo adquiri estrellado en su totalidad de la pantalla pero asi aun sin problemas el celular jala al 100% .. ¡¡¡¡¡¡NO LO COMPREN, ES MUY DEFICIENTE!!!!!!!. En noviembre del año pasado yo compré el X Cam, pero la verdad quedé muy decepcionado, sobretodo por la carga de la batería, es el teléfono más lento que he visto en carga de batería y sobre las cámaras, la verdad dejó mucho que desear, tengo un Iphone 5 y toma mejores fotos, lo único que medio salva al celular es la resolución de la pantalla y la cámara frontal, pero nada más y también menciono que las aplicaciones se detienen aunque no las esté usando o también en caso de que si, me bota de la app, estoy muy cabreado por lo chafa que en realidad es, pude haber comprado un teléfono de mejor rendimiento y con menos plata. Soy de México, un saludo a todos y en serio, no COMPREN esa porquería de LG X CAM.. Tengo desde noviembre con el telefono y no me habia dado ningun fallo hasta el dia de ayer, me fui de vacaciones a la playa y no habia tenido ningun fallo el telfono, hasta que lo deje conectando en la noche para que cargara y oh sorpresa no se cargo, despues el telefono pareciera que se volvia loco y se desconectaba y conectaba hasta que se empezo a bajar subitamente la bateria y dejo de prender solo se prende el foco rojo, no se si se daño la bateria , alguien podria orientarme , soy de mexico saludos.

This evening, LG announced a new “X series” line of phones that offers an affordable smartphone package with a single “exceptional” feature. The thought is that someone may not have a big budget, but they might want a great camera or great display experience. The X series and its two first phones, the X Cam and X Screen , aim to do that.. With the X Cam, you are getting a phone with mid-range specs, yet it has a dual-camera experience on the back. The cameras are 13MP and 5MP shooters, which combine to make what LG is calling the “most advanced camera experience in a mass-tier smartphone.” The phone also sports a 5.2-inch FHD display, 2GB RAM, octa-core processor, front 8MP camera, 2520mAh battery, 16GB internal storage, and Android 6.0 Marshmallow. With the X Screen, you are getting a phone with similarly mid-range specs, but you also get a secondary always-on screen, just like we saw with the LG V10. The phone’s main display weighs in at 4.93-inches and is HD (720p), plus it has a 13MP rear camera, 8MP front camera, quad-core processor, 2GB RAM, 16GB storage, and Android 6.0 Marshmallow.. The X series will arrive in. Asia, Europe and Latin America within the next month.. LG TO DEBUT “SPECIALIST” X SERIES. X cam and X screen Offer Key Premium Features Without the Premium Price. 15, 2016 ― Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, LG Electronics (LG) will bring to Mobile World Congress 2016 a new series of smartphones developed to offer customers a unique user experience by offering one exceptional feature at a price that rivals mid-range smartphones. The first two models in the X series ― X cam and X screen ― will debut at MWC in Barcelona on February 22. The X cam and X screen are designed for customers who do not want or need all the bells and whistles that come with today’s high-end phones but still desire a great camera or advanced display.. The X cam sports dual cameras on the rear and delivers one of the most advanced camera experience in a mass-tier smartphone. Thanks to LG’s seamless 3D Bending Glass, the X cam features an elegant curved finish on the front and with a profile of only 5.2mm, the device is extremely comfortable to hold in the hand. And unlike other boxy and heavier mid-range phones, the X cam tips the scale at only 118g.. The other model, appropriately named X screen, is equipped with an “Always-on” Second Screen which until now has only been available on LG’s premium V10. The Second Screen sits above the main 4.93-inch HD In-cell Touch display and makes multi-tasking a cinch on the X screen. With the 1.76 inch Second Screen, users can easily access frequently used apps, answer calls without interrupting the current activity or just play music. The Second Screen also lets users check time, date, battery status and other notifications without ever having to turn on the phone. What’s more, the X screen offers a stylish, sleek look with its crystal-clear glass fiber exterior and clean lines.. “Everyone has a favorite smartphone feature,” said Juno Cho, president and CEO of LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company. “At LG, we think there’s room for devices that do one thing very well and that customers shouldn’t have to pay for features that they don’t want. At the end of the day, we’re committed to offering consumers more choices.”. LG’s X series will debut in key markets in Asia, Europe and Latin America starting next month. Visitors to MWC can see the new X series for themselves at LG’s booth in Hall 3 of Fira Gran Via from February 22-25.. * Specifications/Features may vary depending on the market..

LG hints at cool G5 feature with new X Cam and X Screen phones. Watch out, LG is going to storm Mobile World Congress with a range of new smartphones, and to make sure we’re properly excited ahead of the show, it has revealed two of them already — the LG Cam and the LG X Screen. While the phones are mid-range devices, one may hint at the LG G5’s final spec, a phone we think will be the star of LG’s line-up in Barcelona.. The X Series phones bring a high-end feature seen on more expensive devices to more reasonably priced phones. The X Screen’s claim to fame is the addition of a secondary, always-on screen, which we’ve already experienced on the LG V10. The X Cam has a dual-camera setup on the rear, something that’s not on the LG G4, but is rumoured for the LG G5. Could the X Cam be the G5’s little brother?. LG doesn’t tell us anything about how the X Cam’s dual-camera setup works, or the benefits it offers, and that may be because it’s saving all the details for the G5’s big unveiling. Although LG’s keeping quiet about the hard facts, it has given us a rundown of the specs. The X Cam has a 5.2-inch 1080p screen under a piece of 2.5D curved glass, wrapped in a very thin 5.2mm body that weighs only 118 grams. The X Cam’s body will get increase in thickness to 6.9mm at a point though, making us wonder about the final design.. There are 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel camera lenses on the back of the phone — the design of which hasn’t been revealed — and an 8-megapixel selfie cam above the screen. A 1.14GHz octa-core processor with 2GB of RAM powers the phone, there’s 16GB of internal memory, 4G LTE, and Android 6.0 Marshmallow installed. It’ll come in four colors, including gold and pink.. The LG X Screen has a smaller main display than the X Cam, coming in at just under 5-inches, and a lower 720p resolution. Like the V10, the secondary display shows notifications, the date, time, and other quick-glance details such as remaining battery life, plus there are music and call-answering controls. It measures 1.76-inches and has a 520 x 80 pixel resolution. Android 6.0 Marshmallow is installed, there’s a 1.2GHz processor and 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage space, a 2300mAh battery, and the phone measures 7.1mm thick. It’s a standard single camera on the rear with 13 megapixels, and 8-megapixels on the front.. LG will put the X Cam and X Screen on sale in Europe, Latin America, and Asia next month, but prices haven’t been revealed. The phones will be shown at MWC, and we’ll bring you more details when we get a chance to try them out.. Huawei MateBook X Pro hands-on review. The best iPhone X car mounts.
