more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Plamen Dimitrov. Android - Android + Huawei - Huawei +. 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction Making a solid mid-range phone in 2017 is a rewarding, yet difficult task. If a manufacturer gets it right, its product can achieve success on a global basis, but one simple miscalculation can lead to failure in this cutthroat segment of the market. This year, Huawei is aiming to entice budget-conscious consumers with the P10 Lite. Rather than boasting Leica-branded dual cameras and powerful hardware like its flagship siblings, the China-based manufacturer has chosen to equip the P10 Lite with a mid-range processor and a single 12MP shooter at the back, thus slashing the price to around $350. These aren't the only changes that Huawei has decided to make, so a closer inspection is needed in order to establish if the handset is worthy of your attention. Let's dive right into it! In the box: Huawei P10 Lite 2.0 A charger Micro USB cable In-ear headphones Information leaflets SIM ejector pin Design The P10 Lite is an attractive phone that adheres to Huawei's design philosophy. However, it doesn't look like a proper member of the P10 family, as it bears a much stronger resemblance to last year's P9 Lite. You still get sleek, rounded corners on the glass and a diamond-cut metal frame, but things start to diverge from there on. The P10/ P10 Plus feature an all-metal design, whereas the back plate on the Lite is made out of glass. This doesn't necessarily mean that it feels cheaper or less comfortable to hold, but pay attention as to where you leave the phone, as any surface that isn't absolutely flat can prompt the Lite to slide like there's no tomorrow. If you're planning on buying this handset, a case should be your next immediate purchase. Other notable differences between the mid-ranger and its flagship counterparts include the lack of a dual-camera setup and physical home button, fingerprint scanner positioning, and the use of a microUSB port for charging. The fingerprint scanner is well-positioned at the back of the device at a safe distance from the camera. Unlike some expensive, high-end Android phones, you won't run the risk of smudging the photo sensor every time you attempt to gain access to the P10 Lite. Also, Huawei has made sure to employ scanners which are super fast and reliable, so it's highly recommended that you give it a try. Moving on to the sides of the phone - the textured power button and volume rocker are situated on the right, while the dual-SIM tray can be found on the left. At the bottom, you'll locate the microUSB port and speaker grill, while the 3.5mm headphone jack sits at the top. In terms of size, the P10 Lite is marginally taller, wider, and thicker than the P10. This can be partly attributed to the fact that this mid-range handset actually hosts a display which is slightly larger than the one on Huawei's smaller 2017 flagship. Display The Huawei P10 Lite comes with a 5.2-inch, Full HD LCD display. Its 1,080 x 1,920 resolution works out a decent pixel density of 424 ppi, while the maximum and minimum brightness levels respectively stand at 539 and 4 nits, ensuring good readability in both sunny and dark environments. This is pretty much where the good news end, however. The color temperature of the screen stands at the extremely cold 9400K, which means that most colors and shades will appear way bluer than intended. If it bothers you as much as it bothers us, head over to Settings → Display → Color temperature to try and balance things out. Also, our screen tests show that there is a slight tendency for oversaturation all across the color scale. As most people like vibrant colors, oversaturation isn't that much of an issue.. 5.77 x 2.83 x 0.28 inches. 146.5 x 72 x 7.2 mm. 5.75 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches. 146.1 x 71.4 x 7.9 mm. 5.73 x 2.8 x 0.29 inches. 145.5 x 71 x 7.45 mm. 5.71 x 2.64 x 0.31 inches. 145 x 67 x 8 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Huawei P10 Lite Compare.

(Posts: 2293; Member since: 31 Oct 2011). posted on 12 May 2017, 10:37. How are "Poorly calibrated display" and "Some serious competitors at this price range" illogical Cons?. (Posts: 101; Member since: 18 Aug 2016). posted on 12 May 2017, 11:58. Because the display can be calibrated from settings. Because not all people like ZTE or OnePlus or the honor 8 .. (Posts: 2293; Member since: 31 Oct 2011). posted on 12 May 2017, 12:16. in response to #3 Hide. Are you seriously suggesting that the way the device comes out of the box isn't important to note?. Are you seriously suggesting that they can't flag the competition as having higher value on the off chance that somebody dislikes those devices?. (Posts: 1862; Member since: 30 Jun 2014). posted on 12 May 2017, 12:42. in response to #3 Hide. The display calibration still doesn't put it anywhere near the identical calibration values, not in colour temperature, and not even in Delta. And your second point is totally invalid because no matter if someone likes those brands you mentioned or not, no one can deny the fact they are some serious competitors to the P10 lite in the US$ 50+- price range.. (Posts: 657; Member since: 04 Jun 2014). posted on 12 May 2017, 17:10. Probably because S8 doesn't get a con for the same stuff.. (Posts: 4; Member since: 12 May 2017). posted on 12 May 2017, 13:03. It does have a lot of competitors in it's price range which are more appealing. But this phone with it's cons receives the same score as xiaomi mi 5. Nice review system you have there phonearena.

It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Manual focus, Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Features: Hyperlapse, Picture-taking during video recording, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2100 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 7, 8, 20.

Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Manuel Masiero ( translated by Mark Riege), 04/15/2017. Android Smartphone Touchscreen. The Huawei P10 Lite mid-range smartphone costs only about half as much as the Huawei P10 with a Leica camera, but has otherwise much in common with the high-end meteorite. Our test shows what ultimately is the difference and who should choose which of the P10 models..

P10 Lite , Huawei presents an affordable alternative to its high-range. Instead of 600 Euros (~$636), the P10 Lite costs only around 350 Euros (~$370). Despite the price reduction, the mid-range test unit has not been slimmed down regardless of the consequences, but instead has gained slightly, that is to say, it has gained in display size. with its 5.1-inch display diagonal, the Huawei P10 Lite shows its Full HD resolution on a 5.2-inch display, without significantly differing from the P10 in height or weight.. The smaller sibling can also use two SIM cards simultaneously, a feature that is even lacking in the P10. The excellent build and the current Android 7.0 Nougat operating system together with the EMUI user interface have remained the same.. As expected, the SoC power has been scaled down: instead of a. the weaker Kirin 658 labors in the Huawei P10 Lite, which however - so much has already been said - still ensures a high system performance. The Leica camera of the Huawei P10 has been omitted from the P10 Lite. As the test shows, what has been introduced instead is not a stopgap solution. With its 12-Megapixel camera, the test candidate succeeds in taking good pictures.. We let the Huawei P10 Lite compete against the similarly equipped smartphones the. Lenovo Moto G4 Plus , and the. that play in approximately the same price league. HiSilicon Kirin 658 ARM Mali-T830 MP2. Test device courtesy of notebooksbilliger.de.

Huawei offers the 5.2-inch P10 Lite in the colors Graphite Black, Sapphire Blue, Platinum Gold, and as in our test unit, Pearl White. Visually, it strongly resembles its high-end. colleague, even if that is slightly smaller at 5.1 inches and possesses a distinctive unique feature with its Leica dual-camera.. In terms of the build quality, both smartphones meet as equals: An aluminium chassis, rounded edges and corners, a glass covered back, practically no gaps, and a slim 7.2-millimeter (~0.28 in) thickness gives the Huawei P10 Lite an appearance and feel worthy of the high-end. The torsional strength is also very high. Although the front glass can be pressed down easily, the smartphone only reacts with a minimal amount of waves forming on the display.. The Fingerprint sensor of the Huawei P10 Lite is placed on the back and thus can be reached without any problem, even in one-handed operation. the manufacturer pursues a different operating concept, since here the sensor is on the front..

Then join our Team!. The octa-core SoC and Huawei's home-grown Kirin 658 combined with 4 GB of RAM help the P10 Lite to a high system performance. Apps load quickly and there are no delays, even when many apps are running simultaneously. Thanks to the memory storage specified at 32 GB, of which 20 GB still remains available after all, many apps can be installed. The internal storage can be extended by up to 256 GB via a microSD card. However, installing apps on it will not work, since the microSD card can only be used for storage of photos and other media files.. Unfortunately, the USB port with the USB 2.0 speed and Micro-USB format supports only the basic program. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) , which bring a considerably more convenient USB. that one can do better in the mid-range.. The card slot of the Huawei P10 Lite functions as a hybrid slot: optionally a Nano-SIM card and a microSD card can be inserted, or you can dispense with the memory expansion and insert two SIM cards instead.. The Huawei P10 Lite uses Android 7.0 Nougat with the in-house EMUI 5.1 user interface, which includes practical features such as an integrated Avast virus scanner. At the time of testing, Google's security patches were as of February 1 st 2017, which is still fairly current.. Fortunately, Huawei has exercised a lot of restraint in terms of adding software. "Fortunately," because even with the few pre-installed apps, which apart from the Google apps include a handful of games and apps such as. â Spider Man: Ultimate Power â,. TripAdvisor, the firmware already occupies around 12 GB on the smartphone, which appears to be mainly due to the EMUI and its features. However, with the exception of the Google apps, all the pre-installed apps can be uninstalled.. The Huawei P10 Lite supports GSM and UMTS Quadband as well as LTE Cat.6 with the 800, 900, 1800, 2100 and 2600 MHz frequencies that are important in the EU area. With a Nano-SIM card including the corresponding LTE data plan, downloads succeed up to 300 MBit/s and uploads up to 50 MBit/s. The smartphone can fit two SIM cards, but only if you sacrifice the microSD card slot. Moreover, you cannot use both cards simultaneously for calls and data services. In WLAN the Huawei P10 Lite communicates via the 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standards and can use the 2.4 GHz as well as the faster 5 GHz band. To put it to the test, we evaluate the WLAN transfer speed with the Linksys EA8500 router. The Huawei P10 Lite does very well, since not only. does it make good use of the available bandwidth, but also clearly surpasses the. The test unit receives data at 229 MBit/s and increases this to 232 MBit/s when sending. Among the competing devices, the P10 Lite is bettered only by the. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) , while the. remain far behind since they are limited to the 2.4 GHz band..

The Huawei P10 Lite quickly finds the current location via. In the test, the smartphone succeeds outside as well as in enclosed rooms with an accuracy of up to 9 meters (~30 ft). In our almost 8 km (~5 miles) bike route where the Huawei P10 Lite has to compete against the professional Garmin Edge 500 navigation system, it proves its practical aptitude once again. Even if it is off the trail in some parts of the route or takes some sidesteps on the way, at the end we measure a distance that is only 270 meters (~295 yd) shorter - this is quite precise for a smartphone.. The Huawei P10 Lite shows a good voice quality in the test. Calling land lines as well as the Vodafone mobile network, the callers could understand each other well at all times. Dropouts or breaks in the connection did not occur. As expected, the call quality reduces slightly in hands-free speaker mode, which, however, does not give any cause for complaint.. Image taken by the main camera (click for original). Image taken by the main camera (click for original). Huawei P10 , there is no Leica camera, but only an ordinary camera sensor in the P10 Lite. However, it still resolves to 12 Megapixel and on top of that, takes really good pictures that can definitely keep up with the images from more expensive smartphones. In the test pictures the detail and dynamic range were fitting. Colors are reproduced realistically, and even in darker areas of the scene there was hardly any noise. The 8 Megapixel webcam also succeeds in taking high quality images. As with the back camera, it can record videos in Full HD at a maximum rate of 30 pictures per second.. Huawei has adopted the extensive camera menu almost one-to-one from the Huawei P10. Here you clearly notice the influence of the professional camera manufacturer: as well as various modes for different motifs such as HDR, panorama, light-painting, and time lapse, extensive image settings are also available, which among others include smile-recognition and object-tracking that can be added. Those who like to determine the image parameters themselves can change to the Professional Photo mode, where all the important settings such as shutter speed, ISO sensitivity, and white balance can be adjusted.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. To test the color fidelity of the main camera of the Huawei P10 Lite, we compare a photo of the X-Rite ColorChecker Passport taken under controlled lighting conditions with the actual reference colors. There is no post-processing of the image such as a manual white-balance correction. As the colors on the ColorChecker card show, the Huawei P10 Lite reproduces the original colors quite closely. Apart from the gray tones that are consistently not ideally matched, the smartphone achieves quite a realistic color reproduction.. To evaluate the image sharpness, we photograph our test chart under controlled artificial light.. The Huawei P10 Lite reproduces it very sharp in the center of the image, but the closer we come to the edges, the more it has to struggle with problems. This should not be overrated, however, since even some professional cameras can only reproduce the test chart with frayed and blurry edges.. The original color is shown in the bottom half of each patch.. Huawei includes a Micro-USB cable, a modular power supply, and a headset. The manufacturer currently does not offer any specific accessories for their smartphone on their website.. The warranty for the battery and power supply are 6 months respectively, and for the earphones it is only 3 months. Independent of that, there is off course the 24-month vendor warranty guaranteed by law on new goods.. The capacitive touchscreen of the Huawei P10 Lite recognizes up to 10 finger inputs simultaneously and completes its task exactly as expected from a good smartphone screen. While it translates inputs quickly and expeditiously, it is pleasant to the touch with its rounded edges and corners. The two physical buttons on the right side of the case feel high-quality as well. The power button and volume rocker sit inside the chassis without appreciable side-to-side play, work very precisely, and acknowledge input with a discrete click.. The fingerprint sensor works reliably and always unlocked the device on the first try in our tests. Unlike that of its larger sibling, the. Huawei P10 , it is now located on the back of the device, as was the case with the. Thus its functions, which for example, include taking calls and taking pictures and videos, can also be used comfortably when operating the smartphone with one hand. The fingerprint sensor also supports swipe and tap gestures without having to register a fingerprint. With a swipe down, the notifications can be called, with a double-tap they can be deleted, and with a swipe up the notifications can be closed again. You can comfortably flip through photos with the fingerprint sensor as well, by swiping left or right for the next or previous picture respectively.. As the first Huawei Lite smartphone, the P10 Lite now also supports the knuckle-sense technology, without introducing any new features with this, however. But operating with the knuckle is convenient regardless: a double-knock on the display takes a screenshot. Or alternatively, you can paint an "S" on the display with your knuckle to do this.. By default, the P10 Lite uses SwiftKey for its onscreen keyboard, which together with auto-correction and an additional number row overlay ensures a brisk operation. Those who do not like the layout can install another keyboard from the app store at any time.. As with the display of the. Huawei P10 , the IPS display of the P10 Lite has a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, but due to its larger form factor (5.2 instead of 5.1 inches) achieves only a marginally smaller pixel density (424 instead of 432 PPI). However, this does not create problems since the contents are also displayed razor-sharp on the P10 Lite, without any individual pixels being detectable.. With 509.4 cd/mÂ² on average, the P10 Lite offers an impressive brightness. An integrated light sensor ensures that you are not blinded in darker surroundings. glows almost 10% brighter, it does not illuminate the screen as evenly as the P10 Lite, which achieves a top value for brightness distribution with its 95%.. The P10 Lite also does slightly better with the black value (0.36 cd/mÂ²) and in this achieves a strong contrast of 1408:1. Although the values worsen slightly (maximum brightness 484 cd/mÂ², black value 0.37 cd/mÂ²) when the measurements are repeated with a more even and therefore more realistic distribution of light and dark image areas (APL50), they still remain above average.. Good: In our tests we could not see any flickering caused by PWM. the P10 Lite also possesses a blue light filter that can be activated to protect the eyes.. 525 cd/m² 504 cd/m² 497 cd/m² 522 cd/m² 507 cd/m² 511 cd/m² 517 cd/m² 499 cd/m² 503 cd/m². 95 % Center on Battery: 507. cd/m²) ΔE Color 5.1 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 6.1 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 99.8% sRGB (Calman) Gamma: 2.28.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8967 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured..

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. A bright picture, strong contrast, no individual pixels detectable: Subjectively, there is nothing to complain about in the display performance of the Full HD screen. However, if we examine the screen with the Spectrophotometer and the CalMAN software a little more closely, the odd discrepancy from the norm becomes apparent. This also depends on the selected color temperature that can be determined in the display settings.. With the default "Standard" color temperature profile selection, the presentation turns out rather cool at 8143 Kelvin, which can be noticed as a slight blue tint. With the "Cool" color temperature profile, this degree of coolness can be further increased. Those who prefer a more balanced presentation need to select the color profile number three: with the "Warm" profile, the P10 Lite is practically on the ideal level (6587 Kelvin, 6500 Kelvin would be perfect) in terms of color temperature, achieving an optimal RGB balance.. With Delta-E deviations that always range between high and very high independent of the selected color temperature, reaching top values of 10 in the grayscale and 7.4 in the mixed colors (values below 3 would be ideal in both cases), we cannot speak about true-color. However, this is not very noticeable or disruptive during operation.. Because of its IPS display, the Huawei P10 scores with a design-related very high stability of the viewing angles. Even viewing from extremely wide angles, the screen contents remain clearly visible and only dim marginally at most.. The smartphone receives similarly good grades in outdoor usage due to its high brightness. If you avoid having direct sun on the display, its contents remain easily visible outside..

Although it is only a small addition to the name that differentiates the two phones, it stands for an immense performance difference: Unlike the Huawei P10 with its. HiSilicon SoC, the P10 Lite uses the Kirin 658 which is considerably weaker. The SoC that was only introduced in March 2017 achieves a performance that is approximately on par with a. Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 , which is used in the. Huawei Nova Plus , for example. In the synthetic benchmarks both those phones are in a close race with the. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017 ) and the. Honor 6X , which both fall back a bit overall. comes in last, while, as expected, the. does not need to fear any competition since it plays in another performance league..

The Huawei P10 Lite sets a brisk pace reading and writing data. The smartphone manages sequential data transfers in particular in a shorter time than the entire mid-range competition that is running against it. How reading and writing is done in the upper league, the. shows with its extremely fast UFS-2.1 storage. However, none of the smartphones can get up to the top rates of the Toshiba Exceria Pro M401 reference microSD card (read up 95 MB/s, write up to 80 MB/s).

Mali-T830 MP1 graphics accelerator, the Huawei P10 Lite brings enough computing power to render the current Android games smoothly to a large extent.. is such a case: even with maximum graphic detail, we measure a butter-smooth 52 images per second on average. show that it does not always run smoothly. The race game that is very demanding on the graphics, stutters considerably with 22 images per second at the maximum graphics detail. However, if you turn down the eye-candy level, the frame rates increase to a smooth 30 images per second; due to an internal limitation in this game, a higher frame rate is not possible anyway.. The hardware does what it is supposed to do: the position sensor works without a hitch and the touchscreen translates the input precisely. If you hold the Huawei P10 Lite in landscape format, it can happen easily that you accidentally cover the speaker located at the foot of the device.. Bearing down on the Huawei P10 Lite with an hour-long stress test, it still only heats up to a maximum of 35 Â°C (~95 Â°F) in this (unrealistic) test scenario, remaining in temperature ranges that give absolutely no reason for concern. During everyday app usage and gaming, you might feel a slight warming at most that would hardly reach the maximum of the stress test.. As the GFXBench battery test that renders the " T-Rex". game scene 30 times in a row shows, because of the low operating temperature of the SoC, performance is also not throttled. Although the performance slows down slightly after around the eighth run, this change is so small that we cannot speak about throttling.. 33 °C 30.6 °C 30.8 °C. 34.5 °C 31.6 °C 34.9 °C. 33.5 °C 31.7 °C 34.4 °C.

Even though the mono speaker of the Huawei P10 is not for the true audiophile, it does its work surprisingly well. At 85 dB(A) the sound membrane can become quite loud and does not distort even at the maximum level. we cannot really talk about listening pleasure,. since the sound reproduction is very sharp and makes listening strenuous in the long run. On mid-level volumes, the speaker sounds much better. Then the mids and highs presented are very balanced and overall produce a sound image that is remarkably good. The sound impression is again much better when using the included earphones.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 29.6 29 29.6 25 28.4 28.6 28.4 31 27.7 29.4 27.7 40 28.8 32.8 28.8 50 28.6 28.8 28.6 63 25.7 25 25.7 80 24.9 25.4 24.9 100 26.6 27.7 26.6 125 34.2 28.7 34.2 160 33.5 21.8 33.5 200 43.6 21.8 43.6 250 48.8 22.3 48.8 315 54 21.1 54 400 58.7 21.6 58.7 500 60.9 21.3 60.9 630 62.7 18.1 62.7 800 65.2 20.3 65.2 1000 67.3 19.6 67.3 1250 69.4 19.5 69.4 1600 73.6 16.3 73.6 2000 74.1 16.1 74.1 2500 75.7 15.6 75.7 3150 75.4 15.5 75.4 4000 68.1 15.4 68.1 5000 72.6 15.1 72.6 6300 74.1 15.2 74.1 8000 76.2 15.1 76.2 10000 76.8 15.1 76.8 12500 70.7 15 70.7 16000 55.8 15.1 55.8 SPL 85 29.7 85 N 59.6 1.3 59.6 median 67.3 Huawei P10 Lite median 18.1 median 67.3 Delta 11.6 3.3 11.6 31.6 36.6 25.4 31.5 25.3 31.7 32.9 31.1 33.6 27.1 31.6 31.5 28.4 29.3 27 29.8 20.8 32.6 22 40.8 21.3 44.7 20.8 50 21.2 54.4 19.4 61.2 19.5 64.6 17.7 69.3 17.9 72.7 17.8 75.5 17.3 72.8 17.4 72.4 16.7 71 17.2 72.1 18.2 72.8 17.9 69.1 17.6 63.7 17.7 60.5 17.8 56.7 17.9 59.7 18.1 50 18.2 45.6 30 82.6 1.3 51.2 median 17.9 Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 median 61.2 1.3 12 31.6 42.6 25.4 37.5 25.3 34.6 32.9 31.3 33.6 30.9 31.6 32.4 28.4 29.7 27 28.4 20.8 29.2 22 31.7 21.3 36.9 20.8 46 21.2 52.3 19.4 55.8 19.5 59.1 17.7 60.8 17.9 66.6 17.8 71.5 17.3 75 17.4 72.3 16.7 72.7 17.2 71.6 18.2 70.7 17.9 67.6 17.6 66.6 17.7 61.6 17.8 56.5 17.9 57.1 18.1 56.9 18.2 42.2 30 81.9 1.3 46.3 median 17.9 Honor 6X median 59.1 1.3 11 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Frequency diagram in comparison (checkboxes above can be checked and unchecked!). The Huawei P10 Lite gets its power from a 3000 mAh Lithium-Polymer battery that cannot be removed. Its power consumption could best be described with the attribute "unremarkable": Compared with the competition, it is neither particularly high (maximum 4.9 watts) nor particularly low, but just within the plain average â which need not be a disadvantage. A look at the power consumption of the competitors shows that with its runtime, the Huawei P10 Lite will not reach the level of the runtime specialists such as the. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) , but on the other hand will easily beat the power-hungry.

With 11:05 hours while surfing and almost 10 hours while playing the H.264 test video, the Huawei P10 Lite achieves good battery runtimes, even if they are not phenomenal. Lenovo Moto G4 Plus , which is overall as enduring as the test unit, led by the. and the Honor 6X, all the other candidates come out better than the P10 Lite.. In the in-house competition with the. Huawei P10 , the P10 Lite just barely loses. Though the power consumption of the larger sibling is considerably higher at times, that is only the case when the SoC is really challenged, such as during gaming or in the last scenario where the app stability test was run. If there are everyday tasks such as web surfing, the Huawei P10 has the edge due to its larger battery. The short charging time, however, speaks for the P10 Lite: it takes barely 2 hours to charge the battery from 0 to the 100% level in our test.. Idle (without WLAN, min brightness) 23h.

Huawei did not promise too much: The P10 Lite is a real alternative to the expensive, almost 600-Euro (~$636),. As with its high-end relative, the mid-range convinces with an excellent build, which makes it look significantly more expensive than one would imagine considering its current street price of around 350 Euros (~$371) at the time of testing. Though the P10 Lite does not have the Leica camera of the. a 12-Megapixel camera that scores with a surprisingly high image quality proves to be a worthy alternative.. We also liked the bright display and features such as the fast WLAN, LTE Cat.6, as well as the option to operate two SIM cards in the smartphone, even though one has to give up the microSD slot for it. The battery runtimes are reasonable and should last the user through a complete day without any problems.. If it does not have to be an extra fast processor and Leica camera optics as in the Huawei P10, it is worth taking a look at the Huawei P10 Lite. At 350 Euros (~$371), the mid-range 5.2-inch smartphone offers the most affordable entry into the P10 product series.. Huawei has saved on the USB-2.0 port, which with its older Micro-USB connector instead of Type-C, invites playing the jolly "oh, I got it upside down" game. Unfortunately, apps cannot be installed on the microSD card - a shame, considering the particularly extensive firmware that reduces the 32 GB storage to a mere 20 GB. At least almost all the pre-installed apps can be cleaned off the smartphone to free some storage. There is almost nothing wrong with the SoC performance. "Almost" since when you use the Huawei P10 Lite for gaming, the graphic details possibly have to be reduced for the display to keep running smoothly..

We take a close look at the specs, camera tech, performance and features of all three of Huawei’s new 2017 phones to see which might be best for you.. Huawei’s P10 flagship phone is a solid handset, offering innovative camera tech, blazing performance and some really sexy design work. Sadly it’s also a bit expensive, at £549 SIM-free. And if you want to upgrade to the super-powered P10 Plus , that’ll be an extra hundred quid.. But Huawei has just announced the new P10 Lite handset, which offers some strong specs at a much reduced price. Just £299 nets you this Full HD phone, boasting the latest EMUI 5.1 and Android Nougat software.. So what’s the difference between Huawei’s three new 2017 phones? Here’s our full P10 Lite vs P10 vs P10 Plus comparison review to clue you in.. Read next: P8 Lite 2017 vs P9 Lite vs P10 Lite, what’s the difference?. The P10 is a great-looking phone, a kind of love child cross between the P9 and Apple’s iPhone 7. At 5.1-inches it’s pleasingly compact, while the larger P10 Plus demands two-handed use thanks to its larger 5.5-inch build. And while you might expect the P10 Lite to be a little smaller than the standard P10, it’s actually a 5.2-inch handset.. All three phones come with a sandblasted finish, but the P10 Lite is only launching in two colours: Midnight Black and Platinum Gold. By comparison, the P10 and P10 Plus. in a vibrant range of colours including some eye-catching new blue and green models. There’s also a choice of the ‘dazzling’ and ceramic-style finishes, which offer a fresh new look and feel.. In all three cases you also get. a fast-acting and reliable fingerprint sensor, which can be used to quickly and securely. However, while the P10 and P10 Plus sport this sensor on the front of the phone, beneath the screen, the P10 Lite rehouses the scanner on the rear end. This makes for a more comfortable unlocking experience, while gesture support is once again included.. EMUI 5.1 , Huawei’s feature-packed software which sits neatly on top of Android Nougat. This offers the likes of Knuckle Mode, which can be used to enter split-screen mode, plus some clever resource management.. Read next: EMUI 5 tips and tricks to get the most from your Huawei phone. Both the P10 Lite and P10 sport a Full HD screen, with the P10 Lite’s 5.2-inch panel proving a tiny bit bigger than the P10’s 5.1-inch display. Either will do the job nicely for media fans, offering crisp and detailed visuals. You get the Eye Comfort mode for evening viewing too.. If you want the absolute best visuals however, the P10 Plus is the one to aim for. This 5.5-inch screen boasts a super-sharp Quad HD resolution, although vibrancy levels and the rest are pretty much on par with the smaller Huawei phones.. We’re still waiting on confirmation of the P10 Lite’s storage options here in the UK, but all three phones offer microSD expansion for boosting the on-board space.. Read next: Huawei P10 tips and tricks. Unsurprisingly, you get improved performance as you ascend through these Huawei P10 smartphones.. The P10 Lite offers the most basic performance in the group, with its new Kirin 658 processor. We’re yet to test out this chipset, but the 4GB of memory backing it up hopefully should make for smooth everyday performance.. Jump up to the Huawei P10 and you get Huawei’s powerful Kirin 960 chipset, first unveiled on the rather meaty Mate 9 last year. With 4GB of memory once again on board, you won’t see any stutters or pauses as you skim through Android and get busy with apps. The latest games pose no problem either.. Meanwhile the P10 Plus sports the same 960 processor, plus more RAM. With 6GB in total, we found the P10 Plus to be just as smooth as the smaller P10 and more future-proof.. You also get a larger battery as you jump from the P10 Lite to the P10 and P10 Plus, although all three sport Huawei’s quick charging tech. We’re yet to test the P10 Lite’s battery life, but the P10 offers just about a full day of heavy use between charges. The P10 Plus fares a bit better, giving close to 36 hours of play time per charge.. boasts Huawei’s dual-lens Leica 2 camera, which can capture impressively detailed shots in most conditions. We’re particularly big fans of the sexy bokeh in the Wide Aperture Mode, which helps your subject to stand out. That’s made possible thanks to the dual lenses, which focus on a chosen point while blurring out the background.. The P10 Plus also goes for two lenses, one monochrome and one colour as on the P10. wide-aperture shooter is more capable in low light, while still producing stunning snaps under normal conditions.. Both of these phones can shoot up to 4K resolution video, with efficient compression to keep the footage from taking up too much space on your handset. You also get a strong range of bonus features, such as the Portrait Mode to help your subject to stand out.. The P10 Lite sports a single 12-megapixel rear lens, with a large. This should hopefully make for strong low light performance, although we’ll need to test this out to be sure..

Download Luminar & Try Free ». The Huawei P10 Lite is a budget version of the main Huawei P10 flagship smartphone. It shares some of the same specifications of its sibling, but it is available to buy at a cheaper price. We’ll be taking a look at how the Huawei P10 Lite’s camera performs. It features a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera, which is joined by a front-facing 8-megapixel selfie camera. Unlike the main P10 camera, the Lite doesn’t have a dual-lens set-up, and, there’s no mention of co-engineering with Leica. Other specifications which are likely to be of interest to the photographically minded is the fast-charging battery, and the 5.2-inch Full HD display. The device we have been working with has been loaned to us by Vodafone, who you can order the Huawei P10 Lite with. The Huawei P10 Lite costs around £269 sim free.. The Huawei P10 Lite is a mid-range phone, and in terms of sizing, it also sits somewhere in the middle too. With it’s 5.2-inch screen it’s larger than something like the iPhone 7 (4.7-inch screen), but it’s smaller than some of the “phablet” devices which are currently available. This means that you can use it one-handed quite easily if you’re using the keyboard for texting and so on.. As is common for modern smartphones, the Huawei P10 Lite uses quite a minimalist design. It’s available in four colours; sapphire blue, midnight black, pearl white and platinum gold. We have been using the black model for the purposes of our review. The edges of the phone are nicely curved for an attractive look, while the metal frame makes it feel higher quality than the price point suggests it might be.. In order to charge the Huawei P10 Lite, you use a micro USB charging cable (supplied). The P10 Lite features fast charging which means that with just a 10-minute charge you get enough juice to watch 2-hours worth of video. It takes just 90 minutes to completely charge the battery to 100%. You can also use the micro USB cable to plug the phone into your computer for transferring images across. You will need the free Android transfer software for your computer to get images across, which is very easy to use.. On the side of the Huawei P10 Lite there’s a slot where the SIM card goes, but there’s also space here for a Micro SD card, enabling you to boost the internal memory capacity of the phone. You will need to use the special tool provided in the box (or a paper clip if you lose it), to access the port, so it’s unlikely you’ll be taking the memory card in and out of the phone with any regularity.. The other side of the Huawei P10 Lite sees the on/off button, as well as the volume rocker switch. You can use the down button in conjunction with the camera. You have the option to press it down twice while the screen is off to launch the camera app - if you prefer you can even have it open and take a photo automatically. Alternatively, once you’re in the camera app, the down button can be used to take a shot.. Another way to open the camera app is from the main screen - you can swipe up from the bottom corner if the phone is locked without having to unlock the phone. You can take photos, but you’ll only be able to view those which you have taken in this session unless you unlock the phone fully.. The camera app itself is well-featured, giving you lots of options. If you swipe left, you’ll be able to choose between the different camera modes available. The standard “Photo” mode is a fully automatic option which suits most situations, or beginner photographers. There is a “Pro Photo” option which is likely to be appealing to enthusiast photographers. If you select this option, you’ll be able to make a number of changes to different shooting parameters, displayed along the bottom of the screen. There’s the ability to change ISO, shutter speed, exposure compensation, AF mode, metering and white balance. The only thing you can’t change here is aperture, which is somewhat of a shame. Still, it’s nice to have options at all. Unlike the more advanced P10 camera, the Lite doesn’t give you the option to shoot in raw format, which may be disappointing to some, but is unlikely to bother the average smartphone user.. After you’ve changed any or all of these parameters, if the image doesn’t look right, you have the option to return everything to automatic or default settings by tapping an icon in the corner of the screen. It’s a good way to quickly start again without having to change everything individually.. Further at the bottom of the screen you’ll see three icons, in the middle is the photo button - you can use this as an alternative to using the physical down button on the side of the camera. To the right of this icon is the video icon, which you need to press to switch to video recording - the Huawei P10 Lite maxes out at full HD rather than 4K.. To the left of the central icon is an icon which you can use for playing back your images.. If you’re shooting in the automatic Photo mode, you’ll see that there are some options displayed at the top of the screen too. You can switch the flash on and off, adjust the level of skin smoothing, add a filter, and switch to the front facing camera. Other shooting modes available from the left swipe menu include video, pro video, HDR, time-lapse, panorama, light painting and all-focus. The last option is interesting as it gives you the ability to change the focus point after you’ve taken the shot - it’s quite a fun feature which is perhaps more of a party trick than something you’ll. want to do often, but it’s impressive for close-up shots where there’s a shallow depth of field displayed.. Swiping right on the Huawei P10 Lite's main camera screen also reveals some settings which you can change. These change depending on the shooting mode you’re working in, but generally include options to change photo or video resolution, switching sounds off, switching the timer on, and so on. You can also switch on “capture smiles”, which means the shutter release will automatically be triggered if the phone detects someone smiling in a shot.. Tapping different points on the screen in the main camera app changes the autofocus point, but also changes where the camera meters from. That means if you tap on a dark area of the scene, the exposure will change to accommodate for that. The same thing happens if you tap on a bright part of the scene. If the scene is of high contrast, try your best to tap on a part somewhere in the middle to try and get both shadow and highlight detail.. Overall, it’s a pretty easy camera app to get to grips with - especially if you have used an Android phone before. It doesn’t take too long to navigate around the various different options available. You can also use the camera within other third party apps, such as Instagram.. Once the Huawei P10 Lite is switched on, camera start-up time is made quick by the fact that you can access it directly from the start-up screen. Autofocusing speeds are good in bright light, with a little hunting taking place in very low light conditions.. © Copyright 2003-2018 Photo 360 Limited.
