Pocket-lint Pocket-lint Pocket-lint Nokia 8 Sirocco is an Android One handset. Nokia's hardware guardian, HMD Global, has released a full portfolio of devices in the year that it's been releasing phones. Aiming to deliver Nokia quality with pure Android benefits and priced affordably, there have been some interesting devices.. The message so far has been about durability and reliability, looking to pick-up on that ideal of the old indestructible Nokia phones of the 90s. Offering metal unibody phones at affordable prices has won the company fans - and shifted over 70 million phones in 2017.. What was always lacking was something at the real premium end. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is exactly that device: an expression of the high-end, a phone that says that HMD Global can cut it alongside the big names in smartphones.. The new Nokia 8110 4G, aka the new Matrix phone... #nokia8110 #nokia #matrix #8110 #thematrix #mwc18 #vintage #oldphone #mwc2018 #nokiamobile #phone #tech #retro #classic #handphone #oldschool #hmdglobal #cellphone #matrixphone #4g #mobilephone #nokiamatrix #technology #instagood. A post shared by Pocket-lint.com (@pocketlintcom) on Feb 25, 2018 at 8:03am PST. While the Nokia 8 notionally sat in flagship position in 2017, there were always rumours of another device - the Nokia 9. This looked like a fan wishlist and early schematics that leaked showing a curved display like the latest Samsung Galaxy seemed too good to be true.. It was with some surprise that we found the Nokia 8 Sirocco to be exactly that: the manifestation of what looks like Nokia phone fandom. Juho Sarvikas, chief product officer at HMD Global, even described it as "the ultimate fan phone" when introducing it to us.. The core of this phone is stainless steel for added strength over aluminium. The notable other phone that's used stainless steel recently is the iPhone X for the same reason. HMD say that this is the most robust Nokia phone that they've made.. The reason for the steel core is that the front and back of this phone are glass - Gorilla Glass 5 to be exact, with curves running into the edges for a look reminiscent of the Samsung Galaxy S8. At only 7.5mm thick at its fattest part, Nokia has certainly created a striking device.. It also feels like great quality in the hand, although like all such glass devices, it attracts plenty of fingerprints, so it will need a regular clean, but it also carries an IP67 water and dust protection.. It's impossible then to not liken this phone to those from Samsung. We've seen a number of phones apeing Samsung's design recently - like the Porsche Design Mate 9 or Huawei Mate 9 Pro - and that's perhaps a testament to just how iconic Samsung's phone is.. But for a Nokia fan, there's plenty to celebrate: this phone is more lustworthy than the Nokia 8 that it's based on, rather more unique in many ways.. The display will likely be the talking point in the Nokia 8 Sirocco, with those curves to the edges. It's not quite as infinite as Samsung's Infinity Display, retaining a little bit more of a border around the edges to the extreme ends of the curve.. But you do get that luscious edgeless feel as you use the phone. Swiping around the device your fingers don't hit a hard edge as they do on so many flat phones and again we can't help feeling that it brings a sense of quality to the experience.. The panel is plastic OLED or pOLED, which essentially means its based on a plastic substrate rather than glass, so it can be flexibly formed into different shapes. It's something that LG has been showing off on its devices - the LG G Flex is one example - but with LG Display showing off flexible form OLED, it's well known how this all works.. Nokia hasn't declared who the panel is from, but we suspect it's LG rather than Samsung.. It carries a quad HD resolution, so 2560 x 1440 pixels spread across that 5.5-inch size. There's a lot of screen crammed into this body and initial impressions leaved us impressed with the detail and the deep blacks - that's what OLED is known for.. Admittedly we've not had enough time to really experience the full range of what this display will offer, but we'll be sure to really test its skills in a full review as soon as we can.. Sitting at the heart of this new Nokia 8 edition is the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 guts as the regular 2017 phone. Using the outgoing platform might be seen as a minor negative, although we can't complain about the performance we've had from the 835 over the past year.. Yes, Snapdragon 845 is the latest and greatest, but both sit on the same 10nm architecture, so you shouldn't feel so hard done by - not when you take price into account.. That said, the Snapdragon platform is boosted with 6GB of RAM and a base level of 128GB storage. That's rather more rare, but not uncommon in this sort of step-up device that's being pitched as something special.. We don't currently know what the battery capacity is (we'll update as soon as we know), but this phone does support wireless charging. That's something that Nokia's other devices haven't been able to offer because of the aluminium unibody.. Otherwise, it's fast charging through the USB Type-C, which will also have to provide your wired music because there's no 3.5mm headphone socket. That's right, in the drive to make this as slim as possible, the old connector was something that had to be removed.. At this stage, we can't judge how well the phone handles as it was a pre-production device with pre-release software. Fingers crossed that the battery has the stamina to give this phone some endurance.. If there was one area that the Nokia 8 struggled, it was in the camera. That's not because Nokia's approach was bad, but because the standard is so high elsewhere, with everyone pouring everything they have into the cameras on phones.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco adopts the dual-camera unit of the new Nokia 7 Plus. This new camera system gives you twin Zeiss lenses, a normal lens and a zoom lens, very much picking up the skill set laid down by Apple and Samsung's dual cameras.. So this feels like something of a rethinking of the Nokia 8 camera, but rest assured, you can skill take bothies, using the front and back cameras to take yourself and your subject in the same frame.. The main rear camera offers 1.4µm pixels, which are pretty large, and has an aperture of f/1.7, both with the aim of letting in as much light as possible for better low light results. We've not been able to test this, so the jury is still out.. What we do like is the lossless optical zoom however. The 2x zoom is just a tap away, very much like the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 , meaning you can get a little closer to the action without a downgrade in quality.. The regular Nokia 8 used its dual camera for quality, pairing a monochrome and RBG sensor - but here it feels like you're getting more immediate practical functionality from that camera, which is always a good move.. There's a portrait mode in the form of live bokeh, again using the two lenses to give you a depth map and choose how much of that background blur you want. It seems easy enough to use, but we've not had time to examine the results.. There's also a full pro mode in the camera for those who want control over all the different elements that the camera offers and the camera app is all Nokia.. We'll give it a full and comprehensive testing closer to launch day.. Nokia has committed to Android One , essentially formalising that relationship with Android that it set out with in 2017. That means that its phones are pure Android with no added apps, no additional services and no bloatware.. For Android fans, this is a great position. While the Android One badging might be confusing, what you really need to know is that Android One doesn't remove anything from your phone - it's pure and unadulterated, with the only changes from the manufacturer being in the camera department - as we outlined above.. So apart from Nokia's camera app, everything else is pure Android. The aim is to give you a "pure and secure" phone and let's face it: Nokia basically spanked everyone else when it came to the Oreo update. The phone that this device apes - that Galaxy Note 8 - is still on Nougat, while Nokia moved the Nokia 8 to Oreo months ago.. Android One guarantees you 2-years of OS updates as well as monthly security updates, so this phone will roll into Android Pecan Pie and Android Quince Jelly (ok, we have no idea what they might be called).. While some may argue that Nokia's lacks the software functionality of Samsung or LG, for those who baulked at the price of a Pixel 2, Nokia might be offering you something interesting here: this is a premium handset, loaded with good hardware for a price that's cheaper than many. And that's not to be dismissed.. HMD Global's message from day one on Nokia phones has been about design and quality. For the regular Nokia devices, it's all about that aluminium block starting point, so you have a strong phone. It's great to see that in this special version of the Nokia 8, that's also being accounted for.. We really like the results: if you were waiting for something striking from Nokia to hold out and show-off, then the Nokia 8 Scirocco is very much that phone. Yes, people will immediately say it looks like a Samsung and that's the elephant in the room here.. What we don't yet know is how the pros and cons will stack up against that smartphone giant Samsung. Will the Sirocco camera deliver? Will the software run fast and furious? Will it deliver the experience you expect from a €749 smartphone?. This phone has its advantages in that clean Android software and it has specs that don't leave you feeling like you're missing out. It's a Nokia flagship and that's a brand that still has huge smartphone value - and for those reasons, we're hugely excited about it.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco will be available in April 2018, priced at €749. We don't know exactly where it will be available, but we'll update as soon as we know..

Nokia 8 Sirocco vs Nokia 8 Design: What’s the difference?. 151.5 x 73.7 x 7.9 mm. 140.93 x 72.97 x 7.5 mm. Nokia 8 Sirocco vs Nokia 8 Specs: Which is more powerful?. Nokia 8 Sirocco vs Nokia 8: Price. Nokia 8 Sirocco vs Nokia 8 Summary: What’s the difference?. Nokia – under the wing of parent firm HMD Global – took to the stage at a dedicated event ahead of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to take the wraps off the Nokia 8 Sirocco, among a trio of other smartphones: the Nokia 1, Nokia 6 and Nokia 7 Plus. But let’s not let them steal the limelight. This comparison is all about the Nokia 8 Sirocco and how it compares to its predecessor, the Nokia 8 .. That’s the first word that comes to mind when you take a look at the Nokia 8 Sirocco. It’s everywhere – on the top, bottom and even the sides. build that debuted on the Nokia 8 has been scrapped in favour. should be able to withstand the odd knock and bump.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is a lot thinner than its predecessor, measuring in at a mere 7.5mm. That comes at a cost, however. In a bid to save space, HMD stripped the 3.5mm headphone port from the device, leaving those wanting to connect an AUX cable with no choice other than to use an adapter – not dissimilar to the solution market leader Apple offers iPhone owners wanting to do the same thing.. But the most notable difference between the Nokia 8 Sirocco and Nokia 8 is the screen. The former is armed with a 5.5-inch curved edge-to-edge screen that spans most of the front – save for a thin bezel at the top and bottom that look like they were lifted straight from the. The latter, on the other hand, is equipped with a standard 5.3-inch screen, sandwiched in between sizeable bezels.. Nokia has also done away with the dedicated physical Home button, moving the enclosed fingerprint reader to the rear of the high-end Sirocco. It’s also replaced the capacitive navigation keys with a user-customisable on-screen solution, which is something that a number of major manufacturers – LG, HTC and Samsung, included – started doing a while back.. Nokia has done some tweaking to the back of the Nokia 8 Sirocco. The dual-camera now protrudes from the all-glass backplate. It also comes with a souped-up 12MP and 13MP sensor array, crafted by ZEISS, that’s said to perform especially well in low-light. We praised the Nokia 8 for its dual-camera (a 13MP + 13MP configuration also made by ZEISS), so it’ll be interesting to see how the two compare..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is a little more powerful than the Nokia 8. It’s armed with a Snapdragon 835 CPU, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and a 3260mAh battery. The Nokia 8, for comparison, also comes with a Snapdragon 835 CPU, though it has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage as standard. A variant with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is available, however.. Sure, there’s the refreshed dual-camera setup we mentioned earlier – but that won’t be enough to drive existing customers to upgrade. With all of that in mind, it’s clear that HMD Global is betting big on the revamped design. We can’t envisage too many people upgrading to the Nokia 8 Sirocco for some more storage and a beefier battery, but the edge-to-edge screen could do the trick.. Just like the Nokia 8, the Nokia 8 Sirocco ships running a near-vanilla build of Android 8.0 Oreo. That, for those unaware, is the latest flavour of Google’s open-source operating system, bundling a slew of neat features, including. support for Picture-in-Picture (PiP), notification channels and adaptive icons. There’s also a brand new Easter egg hidden away behind one of the various settings screens.. Here’s a full breakdown of the internal differences between the Nokia 8 Sirocco and Nokia 8:. The Nokia 8 Sirocco will be available for €749 in April. A UK or US price has yet to be confirmed. The Nokia 8 can be picked up for £399 outright in the UK.. Design : The Nokia 8 Sirocco has a more modern edge-to-edge screen complete with minimal top and bottom bezels. The Nokia 8, on the other hand, has a standard 16:9 screen, flanked by a significant amount of dead space on all sides à la iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The latest offering is a lot thinner than its predecessor and touts a much-improved revamped camera design.. Specs : HMD Global’s latest high-end smartphone features near-identical internals to its predecessor – with the main difference being that it comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage as standard, and has a slightly larger 3260mAh battery. You can also factor in the souped-up camera as a minor performance upgrade – but even with that on the table, it’s still nothing to write home about.. Price : The Nokia 8 Sirocco will be available for €749 when it hits the shelves in Europe in April. There’s no word on availability for the United Kingdom, however. That makes it difficult to compare the handset to the Nokia 8, which commands £399 in the United Kingdom. We can tell you this, though: the main reason customers will want to upgrade will be for the all-new screen.. Are you planning on picking up the Nokia 8 Sirocco?

HMD’s Nokia 8 Sirocco is another breath of fresh air that runs Android One. HMD Global made a huge splash at Mobile World Congress. 2018, launching not one, but five new Nokia-branded phones. The Nokia 8 Sirocco, the flagship of this year’s line up, is a gorgeous phone with strong specifications.. If you’re unaware, HMD Global is a company that launched last year, with the branding license to create new mobile phones under the Nokia brand name. It has to follow certain guidelines from Nokia, to make sure the phones are up to standard.. Here’s everything you need to know about the Nokia 8 Sirocco.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is a departure from the other Nokia phones announced by HMD Global at MWC.. A sleek Gorilla Glass 5 case wraps around a stainless steel frame. On the front you’ll find a nearly bezel-less, 5.5-inch P-OLED screen with a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution, that curves around the edges ever so gracefully. At these edges, the phone is just 2mm thin, but at its thickest it’s 7.5mm.. Flip the phone over and there’s a dual-camera setup with a flash unit sitting top center of the case. The fingerprint sensor falls right below the camera, which should make it easy to locate quickly. Missing, unfortunately, is a 3.5 mm headphone jack.. Long-time Nokia devotees may recall the company has used the Sirocco name — which refers to a desert wind or breeze — before, differentiating an expensive special edition Nokia 8800 phone with it around 2006.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco looks stunning, and no improvement is needed for the specification either. A Snapdragon 835 processor along with 6GB of RAM provides the power, and there’s 128GB of onboard storage which should be enough for most. Be warned there’s no MicroSD slot for additional storage. There’s an ample 3,260mAh battery that supports both quick and wireless charging, and the phone is also IP67 water-resistant.. It is worth noting the Snapdragon 835 is about to be succeeded by the Snapdragon 845 , and will therefore not be the “fastest” Qualcomm chip available. However, it will provide more than enough power for almost everyone for several years to come, so don’t be put off buying it.. In terms of cameras on the Nokia 8 Sirocco, there are two lenses on the back of the phone featuring a main 12-megapixel, wide-angle camera, along with a secondary 13-megapixel telephoto lens. Nokia continues its partnership with Zeiss lenses on the Nokia 8 Sirocco. For selfie use, a 5 megapixel, wide-angle camera sits above the screen.. Nokia has added a new Pro Mode where you can make adjustments to the ISO, shutter speed, and other settings to improve the final look of your photos in the camera app. It’s a common feature on most high-end smartphones, but rarely included with camera apps on Android One devices.. Speaking of software, the Nokia 8 Sirocco is indeed a part of the Android One lineup, meaning it runs a stock version of Google’s Android 8.0 Oreo. We’ve more often seen Android One used on low- to middle-end devices such as the Xiaomi. Mi A1 , and the HTC U11 Life ; but the Nokia 8 Sirocco is considerably higher spec than these phones. Having Android One is a good thing, as it receives timely operating system and security updates, unlike phones with a manufacturer user interface, and there’s no bloatware.. HMD said the Nokia 8 Sirocco will set you back a pricey 750 euros, and it launches in April 2018. There’s no word yet about a U.S. Here are all the Nokia phones HMD Global unveiled at MWC 2018.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. The Nokia 8 Sirocco edition is 95-percent glass. The flagship gets a full redesign and some hardware improvements, too.. HMD brought a Nokia phone for all tastes to this year's MWC. Just as some people might want a retro feature phone or an entry-level smartphone, others want the best that money can buy. HMD's latest offering to these flagship fiends is the Nokia 8 Sirocco, which is pitched as a special edition of the Nokia 8 that launched last summer. Make no mistake, this isn't merely the same phone in a new funky color. It sports a completely overhauled design consisting almost entirely of glass.. Gallery: Nokia 8 Sirocco | 12 Photos. If it looks so different, why bother referring to it as a special edition and simply call it a new phone altogether? Well, HMD probably wanted to be clear that, in some ways, this is still the Nokia 8. (If you're interested, there was special Sirocco edition of the Nokia 8800 way back when, which is where the company got the name from.) Yes, it's still running Android (8.0 Oreo), and inside you'll find the same octa-core Snapdragon 835 chip, 6GB of RAM and 128 gigs of storage. But that's more or less where the similarities end.. Where the Nokia 8 was splash-proof, the Sirocco edition has an IP67 water- and dust-proof rating. It now supports wireless charging and has slightly a bigger battery capacity of 3,260mAh. None of the cameras are the same, either. You still get two around the back of the device, but instead of dual 13-megapixel sensors , you're looking at one 12MP wide-angle shooter and a 13MP camera with 2x optical zoom (the new Nokia 7 Plus has the same setup). The selfie cam has taken a hit, though. It's just a 5MP affair compared to the Nokia 8's 13MP front-facer.. Despite the many changes to the spec sheet, design is the major differentiator here. The Nokia 8 was pretty standard fare: glass up front, aluminum unibody everywhere else. The Sirocco edition, however, is 95-percent Gorilla Glass 5. That other five percent is the stainless steel chassis that's only exposed to the air around the perimeter -- all 2mm of it. It's a glossy, striking handset that feels great in the hand. The only downside, really, is that glass has a habit of breaking.. Because the front pane of glass is now curved, there's a new flexible display to go with it. The Nokia 8's 5.3-inch LCD display has been replaced by a 5.5-inch, bendy OLED screen with the same 2,560 x 1,440 resolution. The display follows the curvature of the glass as it rounds each side to meet the stainless-steel seam -- a design choice ripped straight out of Samsung's playbook , not that we mind. Finally, the Sirocco edition looks that much neater as it does away with the physical key on the Nokia 8's bottom bezel.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is an iterative upgrade rather than a brand new flagship, but it looks and feels like a whole other class of premium compared to its predecessor. It's important to stress just how solid this phone is, too. Combining the weight of the stainless-steel frame with that all-glass design creates a handset you imagine you could knock nails in with (don't try that at home, mind.). The only sticking point I see could be the price. When the Nokia 8 Sirocco launches in early April, it'll go for around €749 (roughly $920/£659). That's not a huge ask for a flagship phone. The iPhone 8 Plus starts at $799, and you can bet the Galaxy S9 we expect to see unveiled at MWC will be more expensive. But, considering the Nokia 8 went on sale for €599 six months ago, the Sirocco edition might look a bit too expensive for some people who value the latest bleeding-edge hardware over a funky design..

Nokia 8 Sirocco design and features. It’s surprising how far Nokia and its parent company HMD has come in a year. Just over 12 months ago the brand was nothing, and now its using MWC 2018 to release more phones than pretty much anyone else. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is its latest flagship and while it on paper looks great, having had an opening play with it, I found it to be an odd device that’s both unique and frustrating.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco will be available for €749 in April. UK and US pricing hasn’t been confirmed.. Out of all the confusing things about this phone, the name is probably number one. This curvy, metal-and-glass slab has almost nothing in common with the fairly modest Nokia 8 from last year, and much likenesses to the rumoured Nokia 9. It feels like Nokia is doing it a disservice by not giving it its own number, and is underselling it in the process.. Unlike most other Nokia branded phones that have appeared since the HMD partnership began, this one ditches the tough aluminium for a body that’s made 95% out of vacuum moulded Gorilla Glass 5. While it looks eye-catching, it feels like the HMD design teams didn’t think much about how this feels to hold. The sides all taper down to leave just a 2mm stainless steel edge and it’s ridiculously sharp.. Another downside of that super-thin body is the death of the headphone jack, which they say simply wasn’t possible to include. What you do get though is wireless Qi (and PMA, for those that still use that standard) charging – something I think will become a whole lot more common now Apple has added it into the iPhone line.. It’s also an odd shape – almost square and vaguely reminiscent of the Blackberry Passport. If you’re used to bigger phones, the iPhone 8 Plus or Google Pixel 2 XL for example, the squat dimensions and fairly small 5.5-inch display will require some adjustment. Having a small phone is far from a bad thing though and I know a lot of people who will prefer this size to anything bigger.. Saying that, the Sirocco (it means ‘a Mediterranean wind that comes over the Sahara’, obviously) is still a good-looking phone. The edges of the plastic OLED display droop over the sides like a Dali painting, while the minimal bezel enhances the modern feel.. Related: What is Android One?. The screen itself boasts a quad-HD resolution and looks good from first inspection. Nokia wouldn’t divulge who provided the panel – LG or Samsung – but it didn’t seem to possess the blue tinge that hampered the Pixel 2 XL so much. Another nice addition, and one that’ll feature across the whole range of Nokia phones this year, is that it’s running Android One. This means you’ll get a stock version of Android 8.1 Oreo on the phone, quick updates for two years and security patches for three. The best thing about Android One though is the complete lack of duplicate apps or bloatware. In fact, the only app Nokia has tweaked is the camera..

Considering that phone costs nearly half the price, that’s probably not what you wanted to hear. The main camera boasts 12 megapixels and an f/1.7 aperture, while the secondary 13-megapixel camera has telephoto capabilities for improved zooming.. The final camera sits on the front and packs 10 megapixels, though Nokia said these are ‘super pixels’ which I assume means they’re slightly larger. Each camera has been made in partnership with Zeiss. Having used the camera on the Nokia 8 a fair bit I don’t have high hopes for the optics here, but I’ll need more time with it to really know how well this performs.. Underneath the glass shell is a Snapdragon 835 mobile platform, 6GB RAM and 128GB storage. The lack of an 845, Qualcomm’s flagship mobile platform for 2018, is apparently down to time constraints with Nokia not having enough time to properly test it in time for the April release. The 835 is still a perfectly capable chip, though.. For a brand as young as the new Nokia, the Sirocco is a seriously confident move. Releasing a €749 phone when the majority of your other devices sit below €400 is an unexpected tactic.. Whether anyone will actually buy this device remains to be seen – especially with an unproven camera and dodgy ergonomics. But I have to commend Nokia for even trying..

Nokia 8 Sirocco and Nokia 7 Plus are Nokia's flagships at the MWC 2018. Nokia Android Announcement MWC 2018.

The Nokia 7 Plus is HMD-owned Nokia's first 18:9 smartphone and is also Nokia's first Snapdragon 660-powered phone..

The result is a phone with a soft-touch, grip-friendly finish and hidden antenna lines.. It will come in either Black or White with Copper accented frame, camera, Nokia logo and buttons.. On the back of the Nokia 7 Plus there's a new dual camera system with a 12MP main camera with large 1.4um pixels and a bright f/1.75 lens and a second 12MP 2x telephoto camera with a 1.0um pixel pitch and a f/2.6 lens. The selfie camera is a new 5MP snapper with the same large pixels as the main camera - 1.4um - and a bright wide-angle lens - f/2.0, 84-degree FOV. All three cameras have the Zeiss branding.. The Nokia 7 Plus uses the Snapdragon 660 chipset with 4GB of RAM. There are 64GB of onboard storage and a microSD card for storage expansion.. The Nokia 7 Plus will be available in both single and dual SIM variants starting at 399 this April.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is technically a more premium version of the Nokia 8 but in practice is much closer to a new phone altogether.. Where the Nokia 8 used a 16:9 5.3-inch LCD of QHD resolution, the Nokia 8 Sirocco uses a 16:9 5.5-inch QHD p-OLED display. The chipset is still a Snapdragon 835 mated to 6GB of RAM.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco does away with the aluminum back of the Nokia 8 and uses Gorilla Glass 5, front and back. The frame in-between is stainless steel.. Thanks to the use of glass on the back, the Nokia 8 Sirocco supports Qi Wireless Charging.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is also IP67 water and dust resistant, compared the IP54 splash resistance of the Nokia 8.. Finally the dual camera system has seen a complete overhaul. The Nokia 8 Sirocco now uses the same 12MP regular and 12MP wide camera of the Nokia 7 Plus.. You'll be able to buy a Nokia 8 Sirocco starting April for the price of 749.

The Nokia 8 Sirocco is a significant step forward for HMD Global. The Android One integration is great news for prospective buyers, and the design and screen are great to look at.. Nokia 8 Sirocco release date and price Design and display Camera Performance and interface Early verdict. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is the "ultimate statement of flagship design with the latest screen and camera technology" according to HMD Global, the firm behind the iconic name that adorns its series of Android smartphones.. It's a bold claim, and HMD admits it's made the Nokia 8 Sirocco "for the fans", as those loyal to the Nokia name have apparently been asking for a premium, high-end flagship that pushes the boundaries the stock Nokia 8 didn't.. The result is a handset with a 5.5-inch QHD OLED display, a body that's covered in 95% vacuum molded Gorilla Glass and has a stainless steel frame at its core.. You'll also find a Snapdragon 835 chipset, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, dual rear facing camera, a fingerprint sensor, face unlock and Android 8 Oreo onboard - ensuring the Nokia 8 Sirocco has a sizable spec sheet to justify a lofty price tag.. However, with a fleet of new flagship phones launching from fierce rivals, the Sirocco will have its work cut out to steal some of the limelight.. Nokia's most premium Android smartphone to date. The Nokia 8 Sirocco release date is set for April 2018, which is a little way off and will see others beat the phone to market, which could be a bit of a blow to its potential success.. Its price tag may be a little hard to swallow for some too at €749 / AU$1,199 (around £660, $900), especially when you consider the OnePlus 5T is much cheaper with a similar feature set.. It does match the likes of the Moto Z2 Force and it's cheaper than the iPhone 8 , so all is not lost in the price department.. Dimensions : 140.93 x 72.97 x 7.5mm OS : Android 8 Screen size : 5.5 inches Resolution : 2560 x 1440 CPU : Snapdragon 835 RAM : 6GB Storage : 128GB Battery : 3,260mAh Rear camera : 12MP + 13MP Front camera : 5MP. Nokia has moved away from the design language that ties together its current range of devices, with the almost all-glass body of the Sirocco oozing premium appeal and futuristic looks.. It looks like a fusion between the BlackBerry Priv and Samsung Galaxy S8 , with its glossy black finish and curving edges of the display.. In the hand it looks and feels great, like a proper premium smartphone, although the glass rear offers little in the way of grip.. The edges of the Nokia 8 Sirocco taper from 7.5mm to 2mm, and on the right the power/lock and volume keys are located at the thinnest tip.. They're flush with the side of the phone too, and this makes them a little tricky to hit. Not impossible, and with time you'll get used to it, but our initial impression was one of slight annoyance.. A couple of other flagship features Nokia had added here are IP67 dust and water resistance, which means it should survive an accidental trip into the bath, and support for wireless charging.. Nokia 8 Sirocco hands on gallery. On the base of the phone a central USB-C port is flanked by an internal speaker, but crucially there's no headphone jack present. Nokia has opted to remove the port on this phone, even though it's kept it on all the other phones it's launched at MWC 2018 .. The 5.5-inch OLED curved display is bright and colorful, providing an excellent surface for gaming and video playback.. With a QHD resolution, it runs shoulders with its flagship peers, and elevates itself above the cut-price flagships from the likes of Honor and OnePlus.. It's responsive, with good viewing angles and adds to the flagship nature of the Sirocco.. Another flagsh feature on the Nokia 8 Sirocco is its dual rear cameras, tuned by Zeiss Optics.. The Nokia brand has a long standing history with Zeiss Optics which has been tuning its phone cameras for decades.. On the 8 Sirocco you get a 12MP main sensor alongside a 13MP telephoto lens, allowing you to take Bokeh effect (background blur) shots.. Dual rear cameras tuned by Zeiss Optics ensure the Sirocco is primed for photography. It actually features a Live Bokeh mode, which allows you to fine tune the level of background blur with instant visual results on screen, allowing you to set up your picture before hitting the shutter key.. Nokia's Pro camera mode has been given a triumphant return on the latest devices to launch, and the Sirocco benefits from this.. A simple drag up of the shutter key take you into Pro Mode (drag in the opposite direction to return to auto mode) allowing you to tweak controls such as white balance, shutter speed and focus.. We managed to take a handful of detailed shots during our time with the phone, but we'll put it to the test fully during our in-depth review.. Round the front you get a 5MP camera which suffices for selfies and video calls.. There's plenty of power under the hood of the Nokia 8 Sirocco, although it's not the most cutting edge.. Running the show is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, a chip which featured in 2017’s flagship phones, so it feels a little out of place in a 2018 top-tier device.. That said, it's a still a top performer, and coupled with 6GB of RAM the Nokia 8 Sirocco should be capable of running pretty much anything you throw at it.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco runs the stock version of Android 8 Oreo. The Android 8 Oreo operating system ran smoothly during our time with the phone and we didn't experience any performance blemishes - although that could change once it's filled with apps, games, videos, photos and music.. Android fans will be pleased to learn that the Sirocco runs a stock version of Google's operating system, so there's no clunky interface getting in the way.. It's also enrolled in Google's Android One program, which guarantees the phone the next two big Android dessert updates, and three years of security updates.. That's great news for users, as it basically guarantees at least three years of consistent use from the phone. And because the phone is with Android One, it should be among the first to get the latest updates too.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is a significant step forward for HMD Global at is starts to show it can mix it with the established names in the market rather than just knocking out me-too devices.. The Android One integration is great news for prospective buyers, and the design and screen are great to look at.. The jury is still out on the camera, and it's a shame to see last year's chipset running the show here, which makes it a little harder to justify the price tag.. While the Sirocco may not be a huge hit for HMD, it's building solid foundations for the brand..

Nokia 8 Sirocco News: The New Flagship Smartphone Equipped With Premium Features Nokia official website Promotional picture for the Nokia 8 Sirocco.. Share on facebook Share on twitter. Share Email Print Share Tweet Pin Linkedin Google+ Reddit. By Shannon Azares , Christian Post Contributor | Feb 26, 2018 12:46 AM. In a bid to compete in the premium smartphone market, HMD Global, which houses the Nokia brand, has announced the Nokia 8 Sirocco during this year's Mobile World Congress (MWC). Further reports reveal that the smartphone stands beside most premium smartphones in terms of the specs that it features.. Considering the safe release and slightly underwhelming feedback from the Nokai 8, HMD Global seems to have made the decision to bump it up a little with the updated Nokia 8 Sirocco, which will feature some undeniably powerful hardware. According to The Verge , the Nokia 8 Sirocco, while not powered by the newest processor from Qualcomm, will be feature the Snapdragon 835 with 6GB of RAM and up to a whopping 128GB internal storage. In terms of the display, it will have a 5.5-inch pOLED that is capable of maximizing 2560 by 1440 resolutions. On the rear, the Nokia 8 Sirocco features the now-standard fingerprint sensor in a prime location, as well as a 12-megapixel camera and ZEISS optics.. Aside from the impressive specs list, further reports. reveal that HMD Global has opted to showcase a smartphone that is made up of 95 percent glass and five percent stainless steel chassis. This means that the Nokia 8 Sirocco is capable of wireless charging all the while showing off a glossy exterior. While this admittedly makes the phone fragile, the design of the Nokia 8 Sirocco definitely fits in the current trend of the smartphone market with thin bezels and unfortunately, no headphone jack.. Despite still having a few ways to go to catch up to the ever-changing demands of the competition, fans believe that Nokia seems to be on its way slowly but surely.

With a promising camera, a beautiful design and build, and fast updates, the Nokia 8 Sirocco is a phone that’s hard to ignore.. With a promising camera, a beautiful design and build, and fast updates, the Nokia 8 Sirocco is a phone that’s hard to ignore.. With a promising camera, a beautiful design and build, and fast updates, the Nokia 8 Sirocco is a phone that’s hard to ignore.. Edges are a tad too sharp. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Ever since HMD started producing smartphones with the Nokia brand name, its designs have more or less been utilitarian. A tough protective metal frame around a single aluminum unibody, with a fairly straightforward rear and front design. Well, the company thinks it’s ready to change things up with its first luxury smartphone, the Nokia 8 Sirocco .. If you recall the Sirocco name, it’s from when Nokia used to differentiate some of its special edition feature phones, like the Nokia 8800 Sirocco. Well, the Nokia 8 Sirocco certainly is something special. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is wrapped in Gorilla Glass 5, with a stainless steel frame in between. Stainless steel is tougher than aluminum, which is used in most phones, and it also makes the phone look and feel a tad more luxurious.. The first thing you’ll notice, however, is how compact the Sirocco feels. The minimized edges around the screen really do make the 5.5-inch form factor feel small. Better yet, the phone is thin at 7.5mm, but the edges curve into the stainless steel frame, with the thinnest point being just 2mm.. It’s quite an experience holding the Nokia 8 Sirocco, because it feels futuristic, and the edges are razor thin. It’s just plain cool to hold and stare at. The sides of the phone do feel a little too sharp, but we’ll have to use the phone a little longer to decide if it’s detrimental to the smartphone experience. What we certainly didn’t like were the buttons — they’re flush against the right edge of the Sirocco, so not only is it difficult to quickly locate them, but they’re tough to press without making sure you exert a certain amount of pressure.. The software is slick, simple, and fast, and the promise of updates is always good to hear from any Android manufacturer.. The rear side of the phone is a little too glossy because of the glass, and it attracts plenty of fingerprints, but that’s a problem with most flagship smartphones these days. There’s a dual-camera system on the top, a fingerprint sensor below it, as well as the Nokia and Android One logos below. We’re hoping the certification labels aren’t going to sit at the very bottom, because it sort of clutters the look of the device.. There’s a USB-Type C charging port on the bottom, and HMD thinks it’s also time to get rid of the headphone jack, sadly.. Overall, we love the look of the phone. It feels compact and comfortable to grip in the hand, and we like how the curved edges don’t blend as much into the frame as the Galaxy S9 , which sometimes interrupts usability. We’ll certainly have to use it for a longer period of time to see if the razor-sharp edges continue to bother us.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco mostly has the flagship specifications you’d expect — except for the processor. It uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chip, which was the flagship processor of choice for many smartphones last year. 2018 is the year of the Snapdragon 845, so it’s a little odd that HMD’s flagship phone doesn’t have the latest processor on board.. In terms of actual performance, though, you won’t see a problem with the 835 at all. Apps opened quickly, and moving through the operating system felt fast. There’s 6GB of RAM on board, which is more than enough, as well as 128GB of internal storage. There’s no MicroSD card slot, which may be disappointing for some, but again, 128GB is plenty for the average person.. The P-OLED 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution on the 5.5-inch screen looks vibrant, colorful, and incredibly sharp — perfect for viewing movies and videos.. The glass back allows for Qi wireless charging, and a 3,260mAh battery should keep the phone going strong for about a full day. The phone is also IP67 water-resistant, which means it should still survive submersion up to a meter underwater for 30 minutes.. The camera system is also surprisingly fast to react. There’s a 12-megapixel camera accompanying a 13-megapixel telephoto lens on the rear — with Zeiss optics — which adds a 2x optical zoom feature, to shoot subjects that are further away, as well as a bokeh portrait mode. We saw virtually no shutter lag, though there was a little blur in the low-light environment we were shooting in.. It’s the “ bothie ” feature that caught our eye. Debuting last year on the Nokia 8, it lets you take photos or videos with the 5-megapixel front camera and the rear camera at the same time, perfect for trying to capture reaction and action at the same time. It worked incredibly well with an easy-to-use interface, offering high-quality photos at the touch of a button.. The new Pro Mode is a nice addition as well. Swipe up from the shutter icon and you can get access to manual controls for the camera. It’s well-laid out and easy to slide the toggles to get the settings you want. This feature will be available on all Nokia phones with Zeiss optics.. Nokia 8 Sirocco Compared To. But perhaps best of all, the Nokia 8 Sirocco runs Android One. That doesn’t just mean you get stock Android with no bloatware apps — you also get access to fast security and Android version updates.. The software is slick, simple, and fast, and the promise of updates is always good to hear from any Android manufacturer.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco will cost a whopping 750 euros (about $922). You can certainly get equal or better specifications for the price, such as with the Galaxy S9, but it may be worth the cost. We’re quite happy with the design, the camera is promising and has quite a few must-have features, and you’re guaranteed immediate updates.. The Sirocco will be available in April 2018, but there’s no word of a U.S. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Nokia 8 Sirocco is the swanky flagship we've been waiting for. With its curving glass and waterproof design, the Nokia 8 Sirocco gives us a lot to be excited about.. February 25, 2018 8:00 AM PST. Specifications 5.5-inch 2K display 7.5mm thick IP67 rated waterproof Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor 8GB RAM, 128GB storage microSD card expandable Dual 12- and 13-megapixel rear cameras 5-megapixel front camera Android Oreo One 3,260 mAh battery. The Nokia 8 may have been a decent all-rounder, but it didn't have the visual pizzazz that a flagship needs. With the 8 Sirocco, Nokia seems to have learned its lesson.. This new flagship may share the same numeral as its predecessor, but it's a more visually exciting creature. The 5.5-inch display stretches to all sides of the phone, curving gently at the edges to meet a stainless steel frame. Sure, it makes it look a bit like a Galaxy S8 , but that's no bad thing. The Sirocco looks and feels like the premium device the Nokia 8 should have been all along.. A glitzy flagship leads Nokia's MWC lineup. It's not just the design that's worth your attention. The display has a 2K resolution. It's also running a powerful Qualcomm 835 processor and comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. There's wireless charging too, and it's waterproof to a depth of 1 metre for up to 30 minutes.. There's two cameras on the back: A regular 12-megapixel one and a telephoto 13-megapixel one for zoomed-in shots. The front camera might only be 5 megapixels, but Nokia says that the sensor is physically much larger, so those megapixels can take in much more light, resulting in better-looking photos overall. We'll be putting that to the test soon.. It runs Android Oreo software -- specifically, the Android One version,a clean version of the software that has none of the manufacturer tweaks you'll find on most top-end handsets.. Overall, the Sirocco is shaping up to be an exciting flagship phone, but it remains to be seen whether it's worth the steep 749 euro price tag (that's around £660 or $925. It'll officially sell for AU$1,199 in Australia). It's due to hit stores in Europe this April. US availability is yet to be announced.. MWC 2018: All the phones and gadgets announced so far.

The Nokia 8 Sirocco is official: This is HMD Global’s true flagship. by Oliver Cragg 17 hours ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. HMD Global unveils Nokia 8 Sirocco at MWC 2018. Features 3D curved glass, 5.5-inch pOLED display, and a 12/13 MP dual-camera. If thereâs one thing that has been missing from HMD Globalâs impressive Nokia revival itâs a true, bonafide flagship phone. This all changed at MWC 2018 , as the Finnish OEM has now unveiled the Nokia 8 Sirocco – a premium, â¬749 powerhouse with an iconic brand name and an all-new look.. The most striking aspect of the device is its design. The slimline stainless steel chassis combines with 3D curved glass for a sleek, lightweight feel and an overall look that screams âflagshipâ.. The same can be said of the display too, which is a 5.5-inch edge-to-edge pOLED panel with a 2560 x 1440 resolution built from Gorilla Glass 5. In a strange move, HMD Global has eschewed recent trends and stuck with a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio (much like the one we saw on the original Nokia 8 ) all while stripping back as much bezel room as possible.. On the camera front, the Nokia 8 Sirocco sports a dual-camera configuration with a 12 MP and 13 MP telephoto combo kitted out with Carl Zeiss optics and 2x optical zoom capabilities (the same setup as the Nokia 7 Plus). Thereâs also a Pro camera mode for manual control of white balance, focusing, ISO, and more, and dual-sight support for taking âBothiesâ in combination with the front-facing, 5 MP sensor.. The vanilla Nokia 8âs spatial audio capture and quick charging capabilities both carry over to the Sirocco, while QI wireless charging and an IP67 rating offer welcome upgrades over HMDâs former flagship.. Unfortunately, thatâs not the case when it comes to the SoC, as the Sirocco is once again powered by Qualcommâs Snapdragon 835 chipset backed by 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB storage. The battery does get a slight boost from 3,090 mAh to 3,260 mAh. Thereâs no room for a 3.5 mm headphone jack, but you do get a USB-C adapter with each device as standard.. Fans of nu-Nokiaâs approach to software will be pleased to hear that the Nokia 8 Sirocco – alongside the newly-announced Nokia 6 (2018) and Nokia 7 Plus – is part of Googleâs Android One initiative, which guarantees a pure, bloat-free OS experience and timely updates. The Nokia 8 Sirocco will run Android 8.0 Oreo out-of-the-box, with 8.1 likely arriving shortly after launch, via an OTA update.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco launches in April – check out our Nokia 8 Sirocco availability post for more info.

The Nokia 8 Sirocco is a curved glass Android flagship with no headphone jack By Tom Warren on February 25, 2018 11:00 am Nokia 8 Sirocco Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge HMD Global, the Finnish company that licensed the rights to produce Nokia phones, first revealed a Nokia-branded Android flagship back in August. At Mobile World Congress today, HMD is launching the Nokia 8 Sirocco, an upgraded variant that comes with some surprising design changes. HMD has opted for glass on 95 percent of the Nokia 8 Sirocco, with a tiny stainless-steel chassis than runs along the sides. The result looks rather impressive, and the fingerprint reader has been moved to the rear to reduce the bezels at the front. The entire phone is curved towards wedge-like points at the edges, with a design that hides the usual ugly antenna lines. It feels small, light, and thin as a result of these changes, although the chamfered edges might take some getting used to. Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge The Nokia 8 Sirocco is powered by Qualcomm’s 835 processor, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. At the center is a 5.5-inch pOLED display (2560 x 1440) that looked like it had good viewing angles and calibration during my brief look at the device. HMD is also using a dual-camera system at the rear with a 12-megapixel primary camera and ZEISS optics. The front-facing 5-megapixel camera also has a wide-angle (84-degree) lens for selfies, and of the software will support HMD’s “bothie” mode to take a photo using both the front and rear cameras simultaneously. While the camera software on the Nokia 8 was rather underwhelming and basic, HMD is upgrading it for the Nokia 8 Sirocco. There’s a new Pro Camera mode, and it’s rather similar to what you might have found on the old Nokia Lumia devices. It provides manual control over the camera settings in a radial menu, with options to change white balance, focusing, ISO, shutter speed, and exposure compensation. It’s useful if you like to get more control over what you’re shooting. As HMD has switched to a glass device, there’s also wireless charging on the Nokia 8 Sirocco. While that’s a welcome addition, HMD has decided to kill the headphone jack on the Nokia 8 Sirocco. You’ll need to use USB-C or Bluetooth headphones, or make use of the USB-C to 3.5mm headset adapter in the box. The Nokia 8 Sirocco will be available in April priced at 749 euros ($920). Alongside the Nokia 8 Sirocco, HMD is also launching two mid-range devices. The Nokia 7 Plus has the same camera system as the Nokia 8 Sirocco, but it swaps the glass exterior for a ceramic coating on an aluminum chassis. The Nokia 7 Plus includes Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 660 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge The 6-inch LCD display (2160 x 1080) on the 7 Plus is 18:9 so it’s extra-tall, but the device still feels more like a 5.5-inch handset. The bezels look similar to Google’s Pixel 2 XL display, and HMD has placed the fingerprint reader at the rear to help with that. HMD plans to make the Nokia 7 Plus available in April for 399 euros ($490). HMD is also introducing a refreshed Nokia 6. The new Nokia 6 runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 630 processor, with 3GB of 4GB of RAM, and 32GB or 64GB of storage. HMD has moved the fingerprint reader to the back of the 5.5-inch (1920 x 1080) device, and added a 16-megapixel camera at the rear with ZEISS optics. The updated Nokia 6 will be available in April priced at 279 euros ($343). All of HMD’s latest Android-powered phones (with the exception of the Nokia 1) will join Google’s Android One initiative. It’s a program that’s designed to provide pure Android on handsets, and something that HMD had been doing before. This will mean Nokia-branded Android phones will get the latest monthly security updates, and stick to Google’s vision of Android design and UI.

The Nokia 8 Sirocco could resurrect the iconic Sirocco brand. by Team AA 3 weeks ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. HMD Global has trademarked the Nokia 8 Sirocco name in a bid to resurrect old but iconic Nokia brands. The Nokia 8 Sirocco will build upon the original Nokia 8 and adds an OLED screen, dual selfie cameras, and additional storage. More details about the Nokia 8 Sirocco as well the Nokia 9 can be expected in the run up to MWC 2018.. HMD Global is looking to bring back fond memories of yesteryear by resurrecting well known Nokia brands. The company has trademarked a new Nokia phone with model number TA-1005 as the âNokia 8 Siroccoâ. Incidentally, TA-1005 was the speculated model number for the much anticipated Nokia 9 , which is expected to be unveiled during MWC 2018 .. Hereâs why I think Nokia 8 is the top choice for a mid-range flagship smartphone. When HMD Global announced its first lineup of Nokia smartphones at the Mobile World Congress earlier this year, the budget devices â Nokia 3, Nokia 5, and Nokia 6 â were underwhelming. This is a throwback of sorts to the Nokia 8800 Sirocco Â. from 2006, which was a premium version of the Nokia 8800 (sliding phones, anyone?). It featured a glossy steel body along with a 262K color TFT display that sported a sapphire glass covering. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is likely to feature an LG-made OLED display, dual-selfie cameras and added storage. The rest of the specs such as the Snapdragon 835 SoC, RAM, primary cameras etc. are expected to carry over from the original Nokia 8 .. This is not the first time HMD is trying to resurrect iconic Nokia brands, though. We saw the Nokia 3310 don a new avatar last year and while there are some modern additions, it tried to stay true to its classic roots. Also, true to Nokiaâs legacy, HMD is looking to scale the feature set across a wide price range while still promising the durability and reliability that the Nokia name stood for. The revival of old brands should strike a chord with fans of the erstwhile cellular behemoth and hopefully, HMD will do more than enough justice to these iconic names. We cannot wait to find out..

The Nokia 8 Sirocco is the "ultimate statement of flagship design with the latest screen and camera technology" according to HMD Global, the firm behind the iconic name that adorns its series of Android smartphones.. It's a bold claim, and HMD admits it's made the Nokia 8 Sirocco "for the fans", as those loyal to the Nokia name have apparently been asking for a premium, high-end flagship that pushes the boundaries the stock Nokia 8 didn't.. The result is a handset with a 5.5-inch QHD OLED display, a body that's covered in 95% vacuum molded Gorilla Glass and has a stainless steel frame at its core.. You'll also find a Snapdragon 835 chipset, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, dual rear facing camera, a fingerprint sensor, face unlock and Android 8 Oreo onboard – ensuring the Nokia 8 Sirocco has a sizable spec sheet to justify a lofty price tag.. However, with a fleet of new flagship phones launching from fierce rivals, the Sirocco will have its work cut out to steal some of the limelight.. Nokia’s most premium Android smartphone to date. The Nokia 8 Sirocco release date is set for April 2018, which is a little way off and will see others beat the phone to market, which could be a bit of a blow to its potential success.. Its price tag may be a little hard to swallow for some too at €749 (around £660, $900, AU$1,170), especially when you consider the OnePlus 5T is much cheaper with a similar feature set.. It does match the likes of the Moto Z2 Force and it's cheaper than the iPhone 8 , so all is not lost in the price department.. Nokia has moved away from the design language that ties together its current range of devices, with the almost all-glass body of the Sirocco oozing premium appeal and futuristic looks.. It looks like a fusion between the BlackBerry Priv and Samsung Galaxy S8 , with its glossy black finish and curving edges of the display.. In the hand it looks and feels great, like a proper premium smartphone, although the glass rear offers little in the way of grip.. The edges of the Nokia 8 Sirocco taper from 7.5mm to 2mm, and on the right the power/lock and volume keys are located at the thinnest tip.. They're flush with the side of the phone too, and this makes them a little tricky to hit. Not impossible, and with time you'll get used to it, but our initial impression was one of slight annoyance.. A couple of other flagship features Nokia had added here are IP67 dust and water resistance, which means it should survive an accidental trip into the bath, and support for wireless charging.. Nokia 8 Sirocco hands on gallery. On the base of the phone a central USB-C port is flanked by an internal speaker, but crucially there's no headphone jack present. Nokia has opted to remove the port on this phone, even though it's kept it on all the other phones it's launched at MWC 2018 .. The 5.5-inch OLED curved display is bright and colorful, providing an excellent surface for gaming and video playback.. With a QHD resolution, it runs shoulders with its flagship peers, and elevates itself above the cut-price flagships from the likes of Honor and OnePlus.. It's responsive, with good viewing angles and adds to the flagship nature of the Sirocco.. Another flagsh feature on the Nokia 8 Sirocco is its dual rear cameras, tuned by Zeiss Optics.. The Nokia brand has a long standing history with Zeiss Optics which has been tuning its phone cameras for decades.. On the 8 Sirocco you get a 12MP main sensor alongside a 13MP telephoto lens, allowing you to take Bokeh effect (background blur) shots.. Dual rear cameras tuned by Zeiss Optics ensure the Sirocco is primed for photography. It actually features a Live Bokeh mode, which allows you to fine tune the level of background blur with instant visual results on screen, allowing you to set up your picture before hitting the shutter key.. Nokia's Pro camera mode has been given a triumphant return on the latest devices to launch, and the Sirocco benefits from this.. A simple drag up of the shutter key take you into Pro Mode (drag in the opposite direction to return to auto mode) allowing you to tweak controls such as white balance, shutter speed and focus.. We managed to take a handful of detailed shots during our time with the phone, but we'll put it to the test fully during our in-depth review.. Round the front you get a 5MP camera which suffices for selfies and video calls.. There's plenty of power under the hood of the Nokia 8 Sirocco, although it's not the most cutting edge.. Running the show is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, a chip which featured in 2017’s flagship phones, so it feels a little out of place in a 2018 top-tier device.. That said, it's a still a top performer, and coupled with 6GB of RAM the Nokia 8 Sirocco should be capable of running pretty much anything you throw at it.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco runs the stock version of Android 8 Oreo. The Android 8 Oreo operating system ran smoothly during our time with the phone and we didn't experience any performance blemishes – although that could change once it's filled with apps, games, videos, photos and music.. Android fans will be pleased to learn that the Sirocco runs a stock version of Google's operating system, so there's no clunky interface getting in the way.. It's also enrolled in Google's Android One program, which guarantees the phone the next two big Android dessert updates, and three years of security updates.. That's great news for users, as it basically guarantees at least three years of consistent use from the phone. And because the phone is with Android One, it should be among the first to get the latest updates too.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is a significant step forward for HMD Global at is starts to show it can mix it with the established names in the market rather than just knocking out me-too devices.. The Android One integration is great news for prospective buyers, and the design and screen are great to look at.. The jury is still out on the camera, and it's a shame to see last year's chipset running the show here, which makes it a little harder to justify the price tag.. While the Sirocco may not be a huge hit for HMD, it's building solid foundations for the brand..

Nokia 8 Sirocco Flagship Android One Smartphone Announced By Adnan Farooqui on 02/25/2018 08:43 PST. Like tech videos? Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube. HMD Global, the company that has the license to produce and sell smartphones under the Nokia brand, has launched a couple of new devices at the Mobile World Congress 2018 in Barcelona today one of which is the Nokia 8 Sirocco. It’s a flagship Android One device that comes with all of the bells and whistles that you would expect from a flagship smartphone in this day and age. It’s also interesting to note that there’s glass on 95 percent of the Nokia 8 Sirocco with only a slim stainless-steel chassis running along the sides.. The Nokia 8 flagship was first launched in August last year. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is an upgraded variant of that device with new design changes that surely make it look quite appealing.. The handset has a 5.5 inch pOLED curved display with 2560×1440 pixel resolution. It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor under the hood with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The fingerprint sensor has been relocated to the back to make more room for the curved display at the front.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco has a dual camera at the back with a 12 megapixel primary lens coupled with ZEISS optics. There’s also a 5 megapixel front camera with a wide-angle lens. A new Pro Camera mode brings advanced manual control options allowing users to change shutter speed, ISO, focusing, white balance, and more.. Since this is a glass device, the Nokia 8 Sirocco supports wireless charging. Fans of the 3.5mm headphone jack will be left disappointed, though, because the new flagship ditches the jack but does ship with a USB Type-C to 3.5mm headset adapter. HMD Global is going to release its first Android One flagship smartphone – the Nokia 8 Sirocco – in April for just over $900.. Read more about MWC , MWC 2018 , Nokia , Nokia 8 ..

MWC 2018: Nokia 8 Sirocco Offers Flagship Performance and Edge To Edge Display With Stainless Steel Chassis. Events MWC 2018: Nokia 8 Sirocco Offers Flagship Performance and Edge To Edge Display With Stainless Steel Chassis. HMD Global Nokia 8 nokia 8 sirocco. While the rumored 5-camera Nokia 10 or Nokia 8 Pro didn’t appear at HMD Global’s MWC 2018 media event, that doesn’t mean the company didn’t announced any new flagship model at the event though. In fact, it actually comes in the form of Nokia 8 Sirocco .. Built with a stainless steel chassis that is apparently 2.5 stronger than 6000 series aluminum, the new phone carries a 5.5-inch curved edge-to-edge pOLED display that also has 2K resolution. As compared to the original Nokia 8 , this year’s Sirocco model features higher amount of memory and storage space at 6GB and 128GB respectively.. Powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 as per its predecessor, it is also equipped with dual rear cameras. That being said, the setup is slightly different though since these cameras were identical to those on the equally new Nokia 7 Plus with 12MP primary camera and 13MP telephoto secondary camera together with optics being provided by Zeiss.. Of course, the Dual-Sight technology and Pro camera mode alongside spatial audio are also included on the Nokia 8 Sirocco.. However, do note that this phone doesn’t come with a 3.5mm audio jack although a USB Type-C adapter is included for users that still prefer to use wired headphones with the device.. The new Nokia 8 Sirocco will begin to be available throughout the world starting from early April for EU 749 (about RM 3,609)..

Nokia 8 Sirocco review (hands-on): Sultry new design but not much substance. A sexy new design for the special edition Nokia 8 Sirocco, but this year’s Finnish flagship doesn’t tick ALL the boxes You are here: Home Nokia Nokia 8 Sirocco review (hands-on): Sultry new design but not much substance. whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin reddit email. Nokia 8 Sirocco review: Specifications, price and release date Nokia 8 Sirocco review: Design, key features and first impressions Nokia 8 review: Early verdict. Nokia’s renaissance under the guiding hand of Finnish startup HMD continues apace at MWC 2018 with the launch of another new flagship smartphone: the Nokia 8 Sirocco.. Just like the Nokia 8, 6, 5 and 3, which launched a year ago almost to the day, the Sirocco is an Android handset and it replaces the Nokia 8 as the flagship atop Nokia’s range.. In fact, Nokia is encouraging us to view the 8 Sirocco as a “special edition” rather than a brand new phone in its own right. That's a bit of a worry given the amount of time that has elapsed since the first one was unveiled at last year’s mobile technology show in Barcelona.. READ NEXT: Huawei Matebook X Pro - MWC's first big launch isn't a smartphone. Octa-core 2.45 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. 128GB of storage (expandable via microSD). 12MP and 13MP telephoto rear cameras. In terms of its looks, though, there’s not much to be worried about. The body is built from a sturdy block of stainless steel and it’s flanked at the front and rear with “vacuum folded” Gorilla Glass 5 that curves neatly towards the frame of the phone all around the edges.. There’s an 18:9 aspect ratio display on the front, which means that, although the screen is a large-looking 5.5in 2K AMOLED panel, the phone itself does still feel quite small in the hand. The main complaint I have with the way the phone looks and feels is that the taper of the glass to the left and right side ends in quite a sharp, pointy, diamond-cut edge.. In fact, with the phone measuring 7.5mm at its thickest point and narrowing to 2.5mm, I worry the phone might be uncomfortable to hold for long periods.. On the rear, the dual-camera module bulges a little too much from the surface of the phone for my liking, too, although the Zeiss logo and chamfered chrome surround mean it looks pretty smart. As ever, the Nokia branding and fingerprint reader are both arranged neatly in a line below the camera and although the phone is only available in one colour – black – it is at least a lustrous, glossy black that catches the light quite nicely..

Qualcomm announces new innovations in AI and connected cars ahead of MWC 2018. While it looks nice, though, the rest of the specifications don’t excite the interest in quite the same way. Those dual cameras might be brilliant, but there are plenty of other manufacturers offering a dual-camera setup. Nokia’s cameras, by the way, capture stills at 12MP and 13MP respectively with the latter offering a telephoto or zoomed in view of your scene.. It’s a similar story inside the phone. Surprisingly, instead of going with the latest and greatest Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, the Nokia 8 Sirocco is sticking with last year’s Snapdragon 835. The Snapdragon 835 was, and still is, a mighty capable mobile chip but when you’re spending €749 (~£660) on a 2018 flagship smartphone, you surely want the best that’s available and this isn’t it.. At least the Nokia 8 looks the part in terms of the rest of its spec sheet. It has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and microSD expansion. It’s IP67 dust and water-resistant, there’s wireless charging and it has a reasonably big 3,260mAh battery on-board, too. In partnership with the 2K screen and power efficient Snapdragon processor, the latter ought to get you through a day and a half at least before you need to rush back to the mains. The phone also runs on Android Oreo - as it should - and performance feels nice and nippy as you’d expect.. Nokia is well and truly on the road to recovery as a smartphone brand and with the Nokia 8 Sirocco – a design that’s both mature and alluring – it’s certain to begin attracting fans back who might have deserted the brand over the past few years.. But HMD needs to do more than this if it wants to hit the heights of the late 1990s and 2000s, when the Finnish manufacturer ruled the mobile industry with a series of unassailable hits. The Nokia 8 Sirocco looks nice enough but at a such a high price - it's. €749 (~£660) - and without the latest, greatest smartphone tech on board, there simply isn't enough substance here to help push the new, HMD-powered Nokia to the next level..

HMD Global, the firm behind the new wave of Android-powered Nokia smartphones, has launched four new handsets at MWC 2018 .. There's the flagship Nokia 8 Sirocco , big-screen Nokia 7 Plus , mid-range new Nokia 6 (2018) and the budget Nokia 1 , as the firm looks to strengthen its smartphone offering in 2018.. All four phones are part of Google's Android One program, guaranteeing them the next two OS updates and three years of security updates.. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is HMD's new flagship phone, with a new design and strong feature set ensuring it sits firmly in the flagship tier of handsets.. It has a 5.5-inch curved OLED QHD display, Snapdragon 835 chipset, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, dual rear cameras (12MP + 13MP), 5MP front snapper, stock Android 8 Oreo and a 3,260mAh battery.. It'll set you back €749 (around £660, $900, AU$1,170) when it's available in April.. If you want a big-screen smartphone that doesn't break the bank, the Nokia 7 Plus could be the phone for you.. It has a 6-inch Full HD+ 18:9 display, Snapdragon 660 chipset, 4GB of RAM, dual rear cameras (12MP + 13MP), 64GB of storage, microSD slot and a sizable 3,800mAh battery.. The Nokia 7 Plus is priced at €399 (around £350, $490, AU$630) and will be available from April.. The second-generation Nokia 6 handset builds on the solid mid-range offering of its predecessor, and offers up a 5.5-inch full HD display, Snapdragon 630 chipset and 16MP rear camera..

The new Nokia 6 will cost €279 (£250, $340, AU$440) when it goes on sale in April.. The Nokia 1 is a little different to the three other new Nokias here, and it's not just its sub-$100 price tag.. It runs the 'Go Edition' of Android, which sees the software specially tailored to run on handsets with less power than traditional smartphones.. That's good news for the Nokia 1 as it packs a MediaTek MT6737M chipset and 1GB of RAM alongside its 4.5-inch FWVGA IPS display, 8GB of storage, 5MP rear camera, 2MP front camera and 2,150mAh removable battery..

Nokia 8 Sirocco specs leaked; Snapdragon 845, 6GB RAM and more. It is believed that HMD Global may unveil the Nokia 8 Sirocco at the upcoming MWC.. Published: Monday, February 5, 2018, 20:00 [IST]. HMD Global is all set to unveil a series of new Nokia phones at MWC 2018. Going by existing rumors, the company will launch the flagship Nokia 9 and the Android Oreo (Go Edition) based Nokia 1. Besides this, we also expect the global launch of Nokia 6 (2018), which is already official in China. However, recent reports suggest HMD may introduce some other models as well. We are talking about the Nokia 8 Sirocco and Nokia 7 Plus.. The Nokia 7 Plus has appeared in quite a few leaks, revealing its design and specs. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the Nokia 8 Sirocco. It was only recently, when we got to know the about the smartphone. Folks at the NokiaMob discovered the 'Nokia 8 Sirocco' logo inside the updated camera app (version 8.0230.50) of Nokia 5, which was running Android 8.0 Oreo beta at that time.. Later on, the smartphone also got listed on a Thai certification site with the model number TA-1005, further confirming its existence. Now, the Chinese publication mydrivers.com has come up with some details of the Nokia 8 Sirocco on its features and specs.. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!. Under the hood Cameras and other features Pricing. According to the publication, the Nokia 8 Sirocco will be powered by the Snapdragon 845 processor. Snapdragon 845 is Qualcomm's most powerful flagship processor till date. Several other manufacturers like Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus are expected to use the same chipset on their flagship devices..
