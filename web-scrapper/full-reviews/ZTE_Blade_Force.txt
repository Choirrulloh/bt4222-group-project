The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD.

These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

ZTE unveils the Blade Force, an affordable phone for the Boost Mobile network. ZTE has taken the wraps off of its latest Boost Mobile-destined smartphone, the ZTE Blade Force. Like some of ZTE’s other recent launches, the phone is aimed at offering decent specs at a reasonable price, and will cost $130 from Boost Mobile.. So what are those specs? Well, for starters, it’ll offer a 5.5-inch HD display with a 3,000mAh battery — which should be plenty to get most people through the day, even heavy users. It also offers an unspecified Qualcomm Snapdragon chip with 2BG of RAM, and comes preloaded with Android 7.1.1 Nougat. While that’s not the latest version of Android, the phone is still relatively up to date.. The camera has become increasingly important in a phone over the past few years, and the camera on this phone doesn’t look to be all that bad. It sits at 8-megapixels, with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. A good amount of storage is also important, and the ZTE Blade Force comes with 16GB of it — though that can be expanded with the microSD card slot.. Perhaps the most important thing about this phone is that it’s the cheapest to support Sprint’s High Performance User Equipment , or HPUE, which basically allows for LTE connection speeds of up to a massive 1Gbps. That doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll hit those speeds, but it does mean that if you live in an area where it’s supported, you may be able to get some pretty fast speeds in the right conditions.. Sure, the phone isn’t a flagship, but it seems to offer some pretty great value for money.. “The ZTE Blade Force continues to demonstrate how ZTE seamlessly blends innovation and affordability into our lineup, while remaining true to what consumers want most in their smartphone,” said Lixin Cheng, CEO of ZTE Mobile Devices, in a statement. “The Blade Force packs big features, Sprint’s HPUE technology, and a lot more into an affordable price point.”. To get the phone, you’ll need to be a Boost Mobile customer or willing to switch over to the mobile virtual network operator. As mentioned, it will set you back $130.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

ZTE Blade Force promises fast download speeds at just $130. by Williams Pelegrin October 10, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. ZTE ‘s upcoming Axon M might end up being one of the more interesting devices to close out 2017 with, but that doesn’t mean the Chinese manufacturer has forgotten about more typical designs. Enter the Blade Force, the latest addition to ZTE’s Blade series of phones that looks to deliver the goods in an affordable package.. One of the Blade Force’s more notable features is the its inclusion of Sprint ‘s High Performance User Equipment (HPUE) technology. In general, HPUE allows Sprint’s current network (and Sprint MVNOs like Boost Mobile) to offer faster speeds, increased coverage, and more capacity for devices that utilize the technology. On a slightly more technical level, HPUE lets users experience the benefits of mid-band spectrum, such as wide coverage, and the benefits of capacity that high-band spectrum gets, all in one package.. Not only does the Blade Force support HPUE technology, but it is also the cheapest smartphone on Sprint that does so. The technology is usually found in more higher-priced phones, so it’s nice to see it trickle down to more inexpensive handsets.. Apart from that, the Blade Force is rather unremarkable on paper, with the phone featuring a 5.5-inch IPS HD display, 8 MP main camera, 5 MP selfie camera, a 1.4 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 427 processor, and 2 GB of RAM. You can tack on an additional 128 GB on the 16 GB of native storage through the microSD card slot, and the 3,000 mAh battery should keep the lights on for a full day of use.. Finally, the Blade Force runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box, which is a bit depressing, since Android Oreo is already available for manufacturers to play with.. If something about the Blade Force caught your eye, the phone is now available through Boost Mobile for $130.. Get the ZTE Blade Force at Boost Mobile. Please enter a valid email address.
