It's out, but only in Indonesia. Cut to the chase What is it? The latest affordable BlackBerry handset When is it out? Now, but only in Indonesia What does it cost? Roughly $260/£215/AU$345 BlackBerry Aurora release date and price BlackBerry Aurora design and screen BlackBerry Aurora OS and power BlackBerry Aurora camera and battery The BlackBerry KeyOne will be getting a wider launch.. BlackBerry has just launched a new phone, called the Aurora, packing a low to mid-range price, a big screen and a curious mix of lower and upper end specs.. If you want to buy it, well, you can’t outside Indonesia, or not right now anyway. But it’s always possible we’ll see something similar get a wider launch.. In the meantime, here’s everything you need to know about the BlackBerry Aurora.. The BlackBerry Aurora is out now, but currently only in Indonesia where it sells for the equivalent of around $260/£215/AU$345.. The handset is aimed at emerging markets, so it’s unlikely we’ll see it in the US, UK or Australia, but it’s possible that a similar phone could at some point be launched globally by TCL (the company now responsible for BlackBerry branded hardware).. BlackBerry also has a new phone called the KeyOne , which will be released globally in April.. The BlackBerry Aurora has a fairly plain design, with a textured plastic shell in black, silver or gold. It’s 152 x 76.8 x 8.5mm and 178g, and unlike some BlackBerry devices there’s no QWERTY keyboard here, just a 5.5-inch 720 x 1280 touchscreen surrounded by sizeable bezels.. At that size and resolution, the display is just 267 pixels per inch, which isn’t particularly sharp, even for the money, but the BlackBerry Aurora justifies its price tag in other ways, as you’ll see below.. The beating heart of the BlackBerry Aurora is an entry-level quad-core Snapdragon 425 chipset clocked at 1.4GHz.. While that’s unremarkable, the 4GB of RAM that accompanies it is rather more notable, matching flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G6. That’s significantly more RAM than most phones at this sort of price have.. The Aurora also has 32GB of storage, plus a microSD card slot with support for cards of up to 256GB. It’s also got dual-SIM support, which while not super exciting is a first for a BlackBerry phone.. Another notable feature of the BlackBerry Aurora is its use of Android 7 Nougat , which is the latest major release of the OS and one which few phones yet run.. The BlackBerry Aurora has a 13MP rear camera with a dual-LED flash, while around the front there’s an 8MP one. A 3,000mAh battery keeps the phone alive.. MWC 2018: All the latest news from the show.

The following is a partial list of BlackBerry products. BlackBerry is a line of wireless handheld devices first introduced in 1996 [1] and manufactured by the Canadian company BlackBerry , formerly known as Research In Motion (RIM).. 1 Early pager models. 2 Monochrome Java-based models (5000 and 6000 series). 3 First color models (7000 series). 4 First SureType models (7100 series). 5 Consumer models (8000 - 9000 series). These two-way pager models had thumb keyboards , with a thumbwheel for scrolling its monochrome text display. The first model, the Inter@ctive Pager , was announced on September 18, 1996. [1] Within a year, Yankee Group was estimating that devices like the Inter@ctive Pager were in use by fewer than 400,000 people and expected two-way wireless messaging services to attract 51 million users by 2002. They provided e-mail and WAP services, with limited HTML access provided via third party software such as WolfeTech PocketGenie or GoAmerica browser.. They were built for use with two 1G data-only packet switched networks : Mobitex and DataTAC. They did not support Java without the use of a Java Virtual Machine add-on.. Most of these models were the first BlackBerry models that had a built-in mobile phone , were the first models that natively ran Java , and transmitted data over the normal 2G cellular network. RIM began to advertise these devices as email-capable mobile phones rather than as two-way pagers. At this time, the primary market was still businesses rather than consumers.. The 5810 was released on March 4, 2002. [4] An aberration in this list, the 5790, was released at a much later date as a niche model in 2004 after many color BlackBerry models were out. This non-phone BlackBerry was made available due to the demand for a Java-based model that could run on the Mobitex data-only network. The 5810/5820 shared the same physical casing and keyboard layout as the earlier 957 device.. The 6000 series was launched in 2003 with 6210 entering the influential Time All Time 100 Gadgets list. In 2003, the monochrome models were revised to include a color screen, while retaining the same form factor and casing. Early color models, such as the 7230, typically used a dim electroluminescent backlight , leading to an initial reputation of poor image quality. Later color models, such as the 7290, typically used a LED backlight, yielding much better screen quality. The color LCD screens used in these series were either reflective or transflective , so these screens yielded better image quality in direct sunlight even with the backlight turned off.. Nearly all models in this list were 16. MB models with no Bluetooth. MB and Bluetooth is the 7290, which was the last model released in the early BlackBerry form factor, and was the first BlackBerry model with Bluetooth. The 7290 was also the first quad-band BlackBerry.. An aberration in this list is the 7270, the first Wi-Fi BlackBerry, released later. It is built into the old form factor in the same vein as the 7200 series.. RIM expanded the market by introducing the first BlackBerry models without a discrete QWERTY keyboard, in the candybar form factor. They developed a predictive text technology called SureType with a QWERTY-like layout, using two keys per button. By using only two letters per button, rather than three letters per button as in T9 using ten-digit keypads, predictive text accuracy could be improved dramatically. The use of a QWERTY-like layout took advantage of people's memory of the computer keyboard, since each button was roughly relative to each key. At the same time, the size of the BlackBerry could be dramatically reduced, as keyboards only needed to be 5-buttons wide rather than 10-buttons wide. These BlackBerries became more popular with the mass market as they became similarly sized to competing consumer-market cellphones.. These models were among the first BlackBerry models to be aggressively marketed to consumers, rather than to businesses. RIM continued to manufacture QWERTY models, to give the market a choice between the traditional QWERTY thumb keyboard, and the compressed SureType keyboard.. Beginning with the 8700-series models in 2006, RIM began to aggressively add consumer features to BlackBerry models, in an aim to capture more of the consumer market from competitors such as Treo and Motorola Q. In this progression of models, the additions include better quality screens, more memory, built-in chat software, first cameraphone, microSD memory card slot, built-in mapping software, and other consumer-specific features. The BlackBerry Pearl 8100 was the first BlackBerry without a trackwheel , which was replaced by a miniature trackball to enable full 4-way and mouse-style navigation on a BlackBerry. The look of the new trackball gave the "Pearl" its name.. The 9000 series was launched in 2008.. ^ a b "RIM and RAM Mobile Data Announce Inter@ctive Pager". Archived from the original on 2001-01-18. At the PCS '96 conference today, RAM Mobile Data [renamed to BellSouth Wireless Data, March 18, 1998] and Research In Motion announced the Interactive Pager for the RAMfirst interactive paging service. The Inter@ctive Pager uses new technologies evolving out of a close cooperation between Intel Corporation and RIM, also announced today. "Pagers Aren't Just For Paging Anymore". estimates that two-way wireless messaging, now used by fewer than 400,000 people, will explode to 50.9 million by 2002. If so, there will be little excuse for missing E-mail messages, no matter where you are. ^ a b "Reload this Page RIM 962 - Does it work in the US?". The 962 is a 2MB version of the 950.

This latest development under our licensing strategy represents a critical step in bringing BlackBerry-branded smartphones to customers all over the world.. Not only do the 250 million Indonesian consumers represent a massive and fast-emerging market, but Indonesia is a hub of innovation and BB Merah Putih is a fine example of that with its world-class manufacturing, design and distribution capabilities.

This was the reason why high profile individuals preferred to use a Blackberry device for their professional requirement.

The reason behind being that Android is not cent per cent secure yet and Blackberry security will only elevate the whole peace of mind for the device user..

However, having realised the fault and embracing the very cause of its downfall, Blackberry might just become the ruler of the turf again.. Good battery : Blackberry has equipped this smartphone with a 3000 mAh battery under the rear panel, which is a good size for an all day usage. Moreover, we can expect the brand to optimise the OS to enhance the battery life further..

BlackBerry launches new Aurora smartphone - but here’s why you can’t get it. THERE’S another new BlackBerry smartphone - however you may face a bit of a challenge in order to get your hands on it. | UPDATED: 16:11, Fri, Mar 10, 2017. This is BlackBerry's next phone - but you might not be able to get your hands on it The BlackBerry Aurora combines Android 7.0 Nougat with some interesting hardware. BlackBerry Mercury officially launched and it's better than you think. BlackBerry KEYOne UK price, release date, where to buy and MORE. MWC 2017 - the best Android 7.0 Nougat phones released this week. BlackBerry is back with its next smartphone release.. Following the hype that surrounded the launch of the BlackBerry KEYOne at Mobile World Congress last month, the company has now revealed another new device.. The BlackBerry Aurora is the company’s first release in partnership with Indonesian firm BB Merah Putih, and looks to offer another affordable Android smartphone.. However for anyone based in the UK, getting the BlackBerry Aurora might not be as easy as expected.. At first glance, the BlackBerry Aurora looks like a fairly decent mid-range Android device.. The device comes with a 5.5-inch 720p display, and runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box alongside BlackBerry’s own software offerings, including the DTEK security suite and BlackBerry Hub.. Inside, there’s a Snapdragon 425, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, a microSD slot up to 2TB, and a 3,000 mAh battery that the company says will provide over 20 hours of battery life.. The phone is also available in black, silver, and gold, and will go on sale for around $260 - or Indonesian RP 3,499,000.. That’s because the BlackBerry Aurora will initially only go on sale in Indonesia.. The move is due to Indonesia actually boasting the world’s largest population of BlackBerry users.. There’s no news on a wider launch for the device just yet, but if the device proves a success we may yet see the BlackBerry Aurora in other markets at some point..

ValueWalk Breaking News, Business, Politics, Technology. BlackBerry Aurora Press Image Leaks, Available For Pre-order. Available for pre-order, but not officially. The BlackBerry-branded KeyOne was unveiled in a pre-launch MWC event, and now, another smartphone dubbed the BlackBerry Aurora is surfacing. A press image for the device leaked yesterday. This phone is apparently custom-made for Indonesia and is unofficially known as the BBC100-1.. The Aurora is expected to come packed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 chipset, 3GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. It will reportedly sport a 5.5-inch 720p display and a 3,000 mAH battery.. However, something that remains unsolved is that the smartphone is listed at an aggregator called Lazada, which enables third-party retailers to display their product on the platform and sell; therefore, doubt about the legitimacy of the smartphone continues, according to Softpedia .. Not just Lazada, but another Indonesian retailer, Elevenia, also displayed the device. Both retailers have posted ads for pre-orders of the device, notes PhoneArena. The handset displayed under the name BlackBerry Aurora is available in several colors such as Silver, Black and Gold, and shipping is expected to commence March 3.. What makes the Aurora different from other recent BlackBerry devices is that unlike other phones, it is made by PT BB Merah Putih for the Indonesian market. For those unaware, PT BB Merah Putih is. a joint venture headed by PT Tiphone and is backed by the largest mobile service provider in Indonesia.. The images that surfaced are not particularly clear, but it is quite clear that the device has a full touchscreen instead of a physical keyboard, as has been the case in most recently-launched BlackBerry devices. The KeyOne came with a physical keyboard. An online picture of the Aurora that emerged showed that the rear of the smartphone is not the usual BlackBerry either; rather, it is shiny and dimpled, while the speakers are fixed within the slit, which is quite visible. housed under the main, single-lens camera, unlike the Keyone, notes AH.. There are reports stating that the BBC100-1 or Aurora has also been given certification in Indonesia and could appear on shelves soon. For now, there are no more details on the device, except that it is. available for pre-order and will cost about $260 in Indonesia.. Unlike the KeyOne, which is dazzling enough to catch the attention of BlackBerry lovers, the Aurora has been a low-key launch. Since the phone is apparently only for Indonesian customers, there are strong possibilities of it being overlooked..

Home Updates BlackBerry Oreo update: Expected release date for KEYone and Aurora. October 7, 2017 - 11:19 PM. BlackBerry devices not eligible for Oreo. Table of content BlackBerry Android 8.0 update list BlackBerry. KEYone Oreo update BlackBerry Aurora Oreo update BlackBerry PRIV Oreo update BlackBerry devices not eligible for Oreo. With BlackBerry KEYone, the company has offered a solid choice for its fans, something that many of its users have happily subscribed to, too. And there’s also a BlackBerry Aurora device, whose users, like the KEYone friends of theirs, are also waiting for BlackBerry to make an official announcement about Oreo.. Well, because BlackBerry haven’t revealed their Oreo roadmap yet, it’s hard to say what release date they are targeting. But because BlackBerry doesn’t have a very good track record with updates, we’re inclined to believe that the BlackBerry Oreo rollout won’t happen that soon, as we secretly wished for. Let’s check out the list of Android 8.0 supported devices of BlackBerry and their expected 8.0 release date.. We would not be surprised to see BlackBerry get a place in a list of first three Android OEMs to release the Oreo update. Maybe their use of stock UI helps them, but it’s more. so because they care about OS updates.. Here is a list of BlackBerry devices that were launched recently, with their Oreo eligibility status and expected release date.. We’re sad to report that the PRIV would miss out on the Oreo update, unless BlackBerry surprises us, with in itself is a wild hope.. As you may have noticed in the table above, there are only two devices that we expect BlackBerry to roll out Oreo for. Of the two, we believe the KEYone would be the first one, given that it already runs on Android 7.1, and thus is a more updated device that any other BlackBerry.. But when BlackBerry KEYone will get Oreo is anyone guess. Even though we’ve seen BlackBerry roll out security patches consistently, they haven’t been very active in providing updates that involve change Android version.. Which is why we cannot be very hopeful of a quick release of Oreo for KEYone. The Q1 2018 release, and that too, towards the end of it, looks likely.. Android Oreo roadmap of other Android OEMs:. The Aurora was launched by BlackBerry with Android 7.0 Nougat OS, and it still runs the exact same version. BlackBerry didn’t think it was necessary to bring the Android 7.1 update — they launched KEYone with this — for Aurora, and that really stinks.. But that doesn’t mean BlackBerry won’t update the Aurora to Android 8.0. After all, Nougat to Oreo could be the only major OS update the Aurora uses would get. And it’s okay for OEMs to skip an update in favor of bigger one to avoid working two times on update, while still delivering on the update that mattered the most.. Given BlackBerry’s record though, expect the BlackBerry Aurora Oreo to roll out only in Q2 2018.. BlackBerry is still updating the PRIV with crucial security patches, but that’s all you get now. After all, BlackBerry didn’t just forget the Nougat update for PRIV, as they decidedly kept the latest OS on PRIV to Marshmallow, having launched the device on Lollipop when Marshmallow was already out.. But we’re a tad glad that BlackBerry is still pushing out crucial security fixes for the device, even though the PRIV stands no chance of Android 8.0 update.. Here’s a list of BlackBerry devices that won’t get 8.0 update:. Do you think BlackBerry Oreo rollout could happen this year?.

BlackBerry Aurora now available for pre-orders in Indonesia; phone ships March 3rd?. by Alan Friedman. Tags :. BlackBerry - BlackBerry + Android - Android +. Those of you with a decent memory might recall that back in December, we showed you information about a BlackBerry phone with the model number BBC100-1. Discovered on the website belonging to Indonesian regulator POSTEL, the handset is the result of a partnership between BlackBerry and Indonesia's Merah Putih. The combined company, BB Merah Putih, has developed the BB100-1 for the Indonesian market. Indonesian retailers by the name of Elevenia and Lazada have posted ads for pre-orders of the device , which reveal that the unit will be known as the BlackBerry Aurora. It is available in Silver, Gold and Black with shipping expected to start on March 3rd. While no specs have been listed, a previous leak called for a 5.5-inch display carrying a 720 x 1280 resolution. Powering the Aurora is reportedly the Snapdragon 425 chipset with a quad-core CPU, and the Adreno 308 GPU. A 3000mAh battery keeps the lights on, and the device will sport support for dual SIM cards. Considering the limited availability and the low-to mid range specs, it is easy for the Aurora to get overlooked by the much more ambitious BlackBerry KEYone. The Aurora is a touch only device with a textured back. It will cost the equivalent of $260 USD in Indonesia. source: Lazada via Crackberry. The BlackBerry Aurora is coming to Indonesia.

Definitely a low-to mid range device, but I'm interested see real life performance of this device, as well as I want to know how well this device does in the Indonesian market. Not liking the way the back of the device is designed at all, but the front reminds me of a Microsoft Lumia 640xl. However, my comment on the back of the device is subjective, and there are others who like the design of this device.. (Posts: 2339; Member since: 23 Jan 2014). posted on 02 Mar 2017, 20:44. A meh device to be perfectly honest. I like the name though, it would've been nice to use that name instead of DTEK here in the States. Reminds me of the Olds Aurora I had a few years ago (an absolute rocket ship dressed as a luxury sedan).. (Posts: 1662; Member since: 01 Dec 2013). posted on 01 Mar 2017, 16:23.

(Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 01 Mar 2017, 19:54. similar price but F1s use SD616, while this one use SD425... (both are overpriced smartphone with low-end processor). (Posts: 17813; Member since: 28 May 2014). posted on 01 Mar 2017, 20:05. in response to #7 Hide. They're both low end devices, hence the low end processors. And if the OPPO F1s is selling well in Indonesia at that price, then the Aurora has a chance as well.. (Posts: 942; Member since: 03 Jul 2013). posted on 01 Mar 2017, 20:58. in response to #8 Hide. Compared to SD616, the SD425 is too underpowered especially GPU. The Adreno 405 inside SD616 is on par with Adreno 320, while Adreno 308 inside SD425 is just an overclocked Adreno 305. And one thing that made me scratch my head is....... WHY SD415 IS SUPERIOR TO SD425???. (Posts: 17813; Member since: 28 May 2014). posted on 01 Mar 2017, 21:54. in response to #9 Hide. Seriously, it's going to come down to how well BlackBerry's Secured Android software is optimized for the SoC that will determine if it's a great performer in real life or not. But if the OPPO F1s can get away with selling in Indonesia at a higher price point than the Aurora, then it shouldn't be a problem for it to sell there either.. (Posts: 1591; Member since: 01 Aug 2015). posted on 01 Mar 2017, 16:29. Might be a decent unit at that price, as long as Blackberry is in charge of the software side of things.

This and the KeyONE are the sharpest phones Blackberry had announced, and for the sake of standing out I think the Aurora does an even better job than the phone its based on.. (Posts: 247; Member since: 15 Aug 2012). posted on 02 Mar 2017, 21:37. 3,5 million is still considered as mid range price for Indonesia which is still expensive. I doubt that it will attract a lot of customer to buy since this is a full touch screen phone where we can get the same specs or at least on par with cheaper price.. (Posts: 573; Member since: 28 Jul 2016). posted on 02 Mar 2017, 22:00. But will you get great secure software experience and speedy security update every month like clockwork?

Review BlackBerry Aurora : BlackBerry Rasa Android Buatan Indonesia. ArenaLTE.com - Aurora merombak tampilan tipikal yang dianut ‘Blackberry’ selama ini. Karateristik dan sentuhan lama terasa sudah mencair. Review BlackBerry Aurora ini mungkin akan sangat merepresentasikan loncatan Blackberry ke segmen menengah yang berbasis Android. Pokoknya Blackberry Aurora tampak seperti perangkat ‘Android mainstream’ yang banyak beredar saat ini. Aspek yang agak menarik perhatian adalah logo khas Blackberry di bodi belakangnya yang diukir halus. Selebihnya, sulit membedakan seri ini dengan smartphone Android lain. So, kami merasa punya kewajiban menyuguhkan review Blackberry Aurora, supaya Anda tak hanya melihatnya secara fisik tapi juga mengetahui performanya.. Bicara soal desain dari hasil review Blackberry Aurora, sang vendor masih coba mempertahankan ‘ built quality ’-nya. Memang perangkat ini diproduksi perusahaan lokal PT BB Merah Putih, tapi kualitasnya masih ‘global’. Meski agak bosan melihat serial ini memiliki kemiripan kuat dengan model Android lain, tapi material ‘ semi-rubber’ Aurora terasa mewah saat disentuh jari dan punya cita rasa premium. Supaya terasa berbeda, smartphone ini memberikan beberapa elemen kejutan diferensiasi. Salah satunya adalah tombol ‘ Convenience Key’ yang memberi kemudahan shortcut ke fitur atau aplikasi tertentu sesuai selera kita. Sayangnya, tak tersedia tombol navigasi fisik di ponsel ini. So, buat akses atau pengoperasiannya, kita harus bergantung ke tombol virtual yang baru muncul saat layar sentuh aktif. Sama seperti smartphone Android umumnya, navigasi menyuguhkan tiga pilihan back, home dan recent. Seri dengan tiga pilihan warna (Black, Silver dan Gold) ini ternyata punya konstruksi semi unibodi. Tutup casing belakangnya bisa dibuka, tapi baterainya tetap terintegrasi alias tak bisa dicopot.. Begitu ponsel saya aktifkan saat melakukan review BlackBerry Aurora, langsung terpampang layar 5,5 inci pada resolusi HD (720p). Reproduksi warna dan kualitas kecerahan yang ditampilkan terasa nyaman di mata. Komposisi bentang layar keseluruhan panel depan masih terbilang efisien, meski sebenarnya. Banyak area sia-sia yang tak terpakai.. Performa layar sentuhnya, di atas rata-rata ponsel lokal. Respon terhadap jari begitu sensitif bahkan sentuhan kecil saja langsung ditangkap layar. Pengalaman menelusuri antarmuka ponsel ini pun sangat menyenangkan. Pergerakan layar ketika bergeser terasa halus dan gesit. Di dalam ruangan, layar menampilkan kualitas terbaiknya, kejernihan gambar, ketajaman obyek dan keseimbangan warna berada pada level terbaik. Tapi jika Blackberry Aurora ini sudah kita tenteng ke luar ruangan tampilan di layar langsung menghilang, kalah oleh terik matahari. Kecuali jika brightness di- setting ke level tertinggi.. Inilah seri resmi pertama di Indonesia dari Blackberry yang resmi menggunakan platform Android. Tak mau tanggung-tanggung, BB Merah Putih langsung menyisipkan sistem operasi Android 7.0 Nougat. Alhasil dari review BlackBerry Aurora yang kami lakukan ini terlihat. antarmukanya terasa lebih smooth, praktis dengan pengelolaan yang menurut saya mudah. Tapi sepertinya sang produsen tak terlalu banyak mengoprek sistem tampilan kosmetiknya. Semua elemen seperti ikon, fontasi maupun layout layar terasa standar saja. Jadi buat yang sudah terbiasa dengan Android, user experience- nya tak akan terlalu jauh berbeda. Menurut saya sih , pengelolaan antarmuka yang seragam seperti ini malah menguntungkan, jadi kita bisa langsung terbiasa. Satu hal yang benar-benar memisahkan Blackberry dengan perangkat Android lain adalah fitur keamanan yang ditingkatkan. Dari sistem operasi yang diperkuat hingga teknik eksklusif Blackberry Limited dalam menciptakan Root of Trust (RoT) pada hardware dengan menambahkan kunci keamanan pada prosesor.. Soal kemampuan kamera, Blackberry Aurora bisa menempatkan diri di tengah-tengah. Jadi, kita tak bisa menyebut kualitasnya buruk tapi juga tak bisa memuji-muji kameranya luar biasa. Ya, biasa saja sih menurut saya.. Secara kualitas, antarmuka kameranya dibenami fitur bawaan standar. Smartphone ini bisa mengambil fokus dengan cepat dan presisi, tapi dalam kondisi low light atau minim cahaya kualitasnya menurun. Hasil jepretan kamera utama terlihat natural tapi tak terlalu menonjol. Sementara untuk kamera depan, karena minim fitur selfie, foto narsis jadi terasa kurang greget. Untuk kamera selfie, Aurora memiliki sensor dengan kekuatan 8 Megapiksel. Sementara kamera belakangnya dibenami resolusi 13MP lengkap dengan tandem berupa dual LED flash. Oh ya, buat yang gemar mengutak-atik sendiri pengaturan saat memotret tersedia opsi Pro (manual) dimana kita bisa mengatur fokus, ISO, WB & Shutter Speed secara auto/manual. Fitur kamera lainnya juga tak kalah menarik, seperti Clone untuk menduplikat satu objek pada frame dan background foto, hingga fitur Time Lapse sebagai elemen tambahan di area ini. Sayang tak ada opsi resolusi kamera, jadi harus puas dengan ukuran standar yang disediakan. Blackberry Aurora mempunyai kemampuan rekam video 1080p. Untuk multimedia, tak banyak yang perlu diulas pada review BlackBerry Aurora kali ini. Hanya disediakan fasilitas pemutar musik standar dengan output audio yang kurang nendang. video dengan interface simpel tapi mendukung banyak format dan bisa menampilkan subtittle. Tak ada sensor sidik jari di ponsel ini. Tapi soal fitur security lainnya, Blackberry ini mungkin paling handal di kelasnya. Meski dalam platform Android, Blakcberry Aurora sudah dijejali software khusus DTEK. Fitur keamanan DTEK milik Blackberry App ini memiliki banyak fungsi. Mulai dari memonitor OS dan aplikasi dalam smartphone jika terjadi resiko kemanan. Lantas ada informasi tentang status keamanan smartphone kita dengan simple dan cepat. Juga notifikasi jika ada orang lain tanpa sepengetahuan kita mengambil foto dan video, hidupkan microphone, kirim pesan hingga mengakses kontak dan lokasi kita. Fitur andalan lain adalah BlackBerry Software yang terdiri dari bermacam komponen. Tengok, BBM Integrity yang otomatis ada dan sudah terintegrasi dengan Android. Lantas tertanam juga BlackBerry Hub+ Services (sinkronisasi semua akun Email, BBM, Sosmed, SMS, Telepon Dan Event Calendar dalam sebuah aplikasi). Belum lagi dukungan BlackBerry Launcher yang mampu menjadikan ponsel ini hadir dengan tampilan khas ala Blackberry. Buat yang ingin memindahkan data dengan cepat bisa memakai BlackBerry Content Tranfser dimana kita bisa melakukan proses transfer data cepat dari smartphone lama.. Sebenarnya kalau boleh memilih, chipset Snapdragon 425 yang tertanam di smartphone ini kurang ‘menggigit’. Mungkin Snapdragon 625 atau 430 bisa jadi pilihan menarik.Tapi apa boleh buat sang vendor sudah kadung membenamkan chip quad core Cortex-A53 dengan clockspeed 1.4 GHz, 64-bit CPU. Kinerja prosesor ini sih sebenarnya tak jelek-jelek amat. Tak cepat menularkan panas ke bodi meski digenjot dengan beban tinggi. Akselerasi dan kinerja saat melakukan prosesing data atau me-render gambar relatif memuaskan. Selidik punya selidik, ternyata sang vendor membenamkan RAM 4GB. Pantas saja jika performanya bisa diandalkan. Lebih dari itu, untuk area penyimpanan file, gambar video dan lain-lain, Blackberry Aurora memiliki storage sebesar 32GB. Daya tahan baterai menjadi salah satu sektor yang cukup menonjol dari smartphone ini. Untuk penggunaan normal, smartphone ini bisa bertahan seharian penuh setiap kali pengecasan full. Baterai Blackberry Aurora memiliki kapasitas 3000mAh. Tapi harap diingat ya, tak ada fitur pengecasan cepat, jadi dibutuhkan waktu hingga 2-3,5 jam untuk mengisi dari kosong sampai penuh.. Blackberry Aurora menjadi BlackBerry pertama di dunia yang disokong dengan dua slot micro SIM card dengan tambahan slot microSD yang terpisah. Saat dijajal, ternyata slot SIM card ini bisa dipakai mengakses semua layanan 4G LTE. Smartphone ini tercatat memiliki band FDD LTE dan TDD LTE yang cocok mendukung layanan operator di Indonesia. Untuk kecepatan akses internetnya, mengandalkan LTe Cat. 4 yang kecepatannya bisa mencapai 150/50 Mbps saat download/upload data. Konektivitas seperti Bluetooth 4.0,aGPS, and 802.11 b/g/n/a Wi-Fi pun sudah terintegrasi dalam ponsel ini. Menariknya, ketika melakukan review Blackberry Aurora ini ternyata USB nya juga sudah mendukung kemampuan membaca flashdisk (USB On The Go). Aurora dilepas ke pasar dengan harga IDR3,499 juta. Dalam tradisinya, BlackBerry sangat jarang mengeluarkan produk dengan harga di kelas menengah. Tapi nampaknya BB Merah Putih yakin, ini segmen pasar yang tepat untuk Aurora. Untuk kelas menengah, kisaran harga segitu mungkin boleh disebut menyentuh batas atasnya. Kesannya memang harganya rada ketinggian untuk spesifikasi yang dimilikinya. Dilihat dari aspek spesifikasi mungkin benar harganya rada ketinggian. Soalnya banyak smartphone Android sekelas yang punya spesifikasi mirip, tapi harganya ada di bawah itu. Tapi lihat pula kinerjanya yang oke. Belum lagi soal kualitas produk, mulai dari tampilan dan pengerjaannya, yang juga bagus. Ditambah, Aurora punya fitur yang tak dipunyai smartphone pesaing, fitur khas BlackBerry. And last but not least …. it is BlackBerry, brand yang identik dengan kaum profesional. So, percayalah, Anda tak bakalan menyesal mengeluarkan uang sebesar itu, untuk memiliki dan memamerkan BlackBerry Aurora.

I am die hard bb fan & I was using dtek50 and with the keen interest on dual sim option I bought this handset with a hesitation as this is launched for indonesian market...but my choice was right as blackberry is blackberry...the hardware and software works fabulous with this handset...specwise this is very medium rated and you could get some cheap chinese phones for this spec around 8000 Rs but the brand we hold and the stability and security of the handset and apps just think of it...it works like champ with dual sim / noughat / great cameras with more advanced options which still other phone manufacturers are working on / bb apps like hub , dtek50 , notable, power centre / complete play store apps without any lag....only drawback is it lacks premium look on the back side and we are not finding any good premium back covers still now...the installed bb launcher gives average look to the phone but use the noughat launcher or CM launcher you will feel the handset like premium with great UI and display...try it guys you wont regret only thing if you are heavy gamer just stay away from this handset....

Trending iPhone X Nintendo Switch OnePlus 5T Tesla Model 3 Xbox One X. BlackBerry Aurora is official with 5.5-inch display, Snapdragon 425. by Killian Bell | March 9, 2017. A new BlackBerry handset has landed less than two weeks after the KeyOne was unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It’s called Aurora, and it was designed and manufactured by BB Merah Putih, the company licensed to sell BlackBerry-branded devices in Indonesia.. Aurora is the first BlackBerry device with dual SIM card support, allowing users to juggle two numbers simultaneously. It is a midrange offering, featuring a 5.5-inch 720p display, a Snapdragon 425 processor, 4GB of RAM, a 3,000mAh battery, and 32GB of internal storage that can be expanded via the microSD card slot. Cameras include a 13-megapixel rear-facing shooter, and an 8-megapixel selfie sensor.. Aurora ships with Nougat pre-installed, and it will be available in black, silver, or gold. Those who pre-order the device for IDR 3,499,000 (approx. $260) will receive a free JBL Go speaker and an official smart flip case for free.. Indonesia is one of the few countries that isn’t covered by BlackBerry’s deal with TCL, the Chinese firm responsible for the KeyOne and the DTEK series of devices. This allows BB Merah Putih to produce devices carrying the BlackBerry name. However, it means that it’s highly unlikely we’ll see the Aurora on sale in any other market.. Of course, you probably will be able to import one to the U.S. and other territories by buying the Aurora online from a third-party seller, but we’ll be holding onto our cash for the KeyOne..
