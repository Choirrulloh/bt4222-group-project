Nokia 7 Specification Review, Features, Expected Launch Date and Price In India. Ever since Nokia made a return under HMD Global, the rumour mills are running at full steam. Among those rumours feature - the Nokia 7. However, after early few leaks it has gone official. As per the street buzz, the Nokia 7 will come with an all-metal body and a 5.2-inch IPLS display with 1080 x 1920 pixels resolution. Following the latest trend, it could feature a 2.5D glass on top of the display which not only adds to the aesthetics but also protects the screen from scratches. The Nokia 7 is powered by Qualcomm's latest mid-range chipset octa-core Snapdragon 630 that comes with Cortex A53 cores ticking at 2.2GHz. The chipset is further supported by 4GB/6GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage. It features a hybrid SIM tray that can hold microSD card up to 256GB in the second sim slot. In optics, the Nokia 7 optics includes a 16-megapixel sensor with f/1.8 aperture, CarlZeiss lens, PDAF and dual tone flash at the rear. Up front, it gets to flaunt a 5-megapixel selfie sensor with f/2.0 and autofocus. Like all other Nokia phones, the Nokia 7 also boots in a near stock version of Android 7.0 Nougat. It comes with a 3000 mAh which is complemented by a 18W fast charger. So far, Nokia 7 is only launched in China. The company has remained tight-lipped about its global availability. Having said that, We expect Nokia 7 India launch to take place sooner rather than later. We expect Nokia 7 price in India to be around Rs.

Nokia 7 is officially announced: Will âBothiesâ finally become a thing?. by Brian Reigh October 18, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The newly-announced Nokia 7 comes with a 5.2-inch 1080p screen, 3,000 mAh battery, and a 16-megapixel camera with f/1.8 aperture.. When HMD Global sent out invites for a press event yesterday, many suspected that it might be for the unveiling of the long-awaited Nokia 7 â and they were right indeed. The company has finally taken the wraps off the newest member of Nokiaâs Android smartphone family, coming exclusively to mainland China in just a few days.. As you can see above, design-wise, the newly-announced midranger is unmistakeably Nokia. On the front are a 5.2-inch 1080p LCD display and a 5-megapixel wide-angle selfie-shooter, and on the back, there is a 16-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture and a dual-tone flash. The company says that similar to the Nokia 8, the Nokia 7 will feature what it calls the âDual-sightâ technology : it essentially lets users take pictures and videos using front and back cameras simultaneously, capturing âboth sides of the storyâ or âBothiesâ as Nokia prefers to call them. Yupp, itâs similar to what Samsung did back in 2013 with the Galaxy S4. Nokia seems to think that Bothies could become a thing, but I’m not so convinced.. The regular version with 4 GB of RAM will cost Â¥2,499 (around US$377) and the more premium version with 6 GB of RAM will cost Â¥200 more (around US$407).. Underneath its glass and aluminium construction, we find a beefy 3,000 mAh battery and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 630 chipset. While every version will come with 64 GB of internal storage with an option for expansion via a microSD slot, consumers will have two configurations to choose from in terms of RAM: 4 GB of RAM, which will cost Â¥2,499 (around US$377) and 6 GB of RAM, which will cost Â¥200 more (around US$407).. The Nokia 7 will run Android Nougat out of the box (disappointing, I know), but the company assures that it will be upgradeable to Android Oreo. And last but not least, the phone comes with the good old 3.5 mm headphone jack, so no need for all that dongle nonsense.. The Nokia 7 will be available in China starting October 24 and at least for now, will remain exclusive to the Chinese market.. Thoughts on Nokia’s brand-new Android smartphone?

Nokia is offering its handset with the newest Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system with bare stock Android interface. Moreover, the brand has assured that its handsets will receive the Android O, as soon as it comes out, which is a huge plus.. Powerful camera setup: In the past, Nokia has been known to offer smartphones with some serious imaging capabilities. And if initial reviews of its devices are to be believed, newer lot of smartphones too come with great imaging capability. The Nokia 7 is equipped with a powerful 16MP snapper on rear and 8MP on the front.. Good display : Nokia 7 is a phablet considering it comes with a large 5.5-inch display on the front panel. The display has been equipped with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which is pretty sharp for the display size. Moreover, the resolution and size is also easy on battery, making it an ideal daily driver.. Poor Battery : The only drawback that one can point out in the handset is the battery it sips juice from. In order to keep a slim profile, Nokia has equipped the handset with a lower 2,800mAh battery. While we can expect the device to last long, it leaves much to desire.. 26,990 (Expected Price) Nokia 7 is currently not available in any online store..

CNET también está disponible en español.. The Nokia 7 is the 5th Nokia smartphone this year. The phone will sell for around $400, and gives you the premium Nokia 8's "bothie" camera software.. by October 19, 2017 1:27 AM PDT. Key specs 5.2-inch, 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution display Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor 4GB RAM, 64GB storage/6GB, 128GB storage. Dual rear cameras, 16MP and 5MP 5MP selfie camera Android 7.1.1 Nougat. Nokia is really making up for lost time.. After releasing four smartphones this year and reviving an old feature phone ( twice ), the company on Thursday revealed the Nokia 7. It's a midrange phone with dual cameras and the flagship Nokia 8's "bothie" camera software.. A bothie, if you're not yet initiated, is when the phone captures what's seen by both the front and back cameras. It lets you share a cool thing (rear camera) as well as your reaction to that cool thing (selfie camera).. The 5.2-inch phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor, 4GB of RAM and a 3,000mAh battery. The two cameras at the back shoot in 16- and 5-megapixels, respectively. The Nokia 7 was announced for China, where it'll launch on Oct. 24 from 2,499 yuan, which converts to $375, AU$480 and £285. There's also a variant with 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage, which costs around an extra $20.. Nokia, now owned by HMD Global, has produced a mixed bag this year. The budget Nokia 3 was too cheap for its own good, while the Nokia 5 was a great bang-for-your-buck offering. The Nokia 8 is the company's attempt to compete with the Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones of the world, but, while a good phone, it wasn't what it needed to be.. It's likely that the Nokia 7, like the Nokia 3, 5, 6 and 8 before it, will launch around the world, but further availability is not yet known.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Hot Products.

According to rumors online, the Nokia 7, Nokia 8 and Nokia 9 could be released this July. Nokia is reintroducing itself to the world as one of the biggest smartphone manufacturer in the industry. The Finnish multinational communications and information technology company has major plans in the coming few months in regards to smartphone releases. Including the Nokia 6, Nokia 7, Nokia 8, Nokia 9 and even their age-old major success mobile making a resurrection, the Nokia 3310.. Just last month, it was reported worldwide that Nokia announced that they will release the Nokia 6 out to more than 120 markets in May. Nokia’s parent company, HMD Global is rumored to have reported that they are ready to release not 1 but 3 more other phones in their Nokia smartphone series. If the report is to be true, Nokia will be taking a massive leap towards success and may even return to their once glory days.. One can say the aggressive initiative from Nokia is a positive sign with the release of the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 Nokia 6, Nokia 7, Nokia 8 and Nokia 9 smartphone devices all in succession within a span of just a couple of months.. The Nokia 7 is rumored to sport a casing made out of metal. In addition, the device will implement an FHD Display coming at a resolution of 1080×1920 pixels, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chipset, latest Android Nougat OS, ultra fast charging, a standard fingerprint sensor and a Carl Zeiss optics camera on the back..

The device will come with the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor just like that of the Nokia 7. However, online leaks suggest it is possible Nokia might implement a Snapdragon 835 processor instead.. The Nokia 9 will be Nokia’s main focus when releasing all 3 models in combination. The Nokia 9 is rumored to be Nokia’s most high-end smartphone device they have ever manufactured. The device is rumored to take on the likes of current smartphone giants Samsung and Apple.. The device is rumoured to come with a 5.5 Inch QuadHD Display with a resolution of 1440×2560 pixels and an industry’s first screen aspect ratio of 18:9, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, the latest Android 7.1.2 Nougat OS, and just like the Nokia 8, 6GB RAM with up to 128GB of internal storage and the option of 256 GB external memory via a microSD slot.. Moreover, the design of the Nokia 9 will include very thin bezels and also metallic, just like the Nokia 7.

The camera on the Nokia 9 is expected to include a primary camera of 22MP with optical image stabilization and a secondary camera of 12 MP coming at an aperture of f/2.0 which is best for when taking selfies or photos in dim lighting situations..

Nokia 7, Nokia 8 Tipped to Be Powered by Snapdragon 660 SoC. Tasneem Akolawala , 15 March 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Nokia 7, 8 tipped to be mid-rangers as well. Both the smartphones tipped to be powered by Snapdragon 660 SoC. The two devices will also support fast charging. Nokia took centre stage at MWC to announce two affordable Android phones and the Nokia 3310 (2017) feature phone in Barcelona. However, the company has not yet announced its long-rumoured flagship Nokia P1 smartphone. Now, a recent leak has shed some light on the Nokia 7 and Nokia 8 , which are going to be mid-rangers, if the rumoured specifications are to be believed.. Nokiapoweruser reports that the Nokia 7 and Nokia 8 will be mid-rangers with the yet-to-be-announced Snapdragon 660 SoC. One smartphone will sport a smaller display with 1080p resolution, while the larger display variant will boast of a QHD display. Both the smartphones are tipped to sport a metallic unibody, and thin bezels. The Nokia 7 and Nokia 8 will support a fingerprint sensor, a larger camera sensor (maybe even a CarlZeiss lens), and will come with fast charging support as well.. As for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 integration, the chip was expected to be integrated first into a Xiaomi handset , but now things seem a bit different. As per previous leaks, the as-yet-unveiled Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 SoC can have custom Kryo cores just like on Snapdragon 820 or might use a combination of four Cortex-A73 CPUs clocked at 2.2GHZ and four Cortex-A53 CPUs clocked at 1.9GHz. The Snapdragon 660 will reportedly go into mass production in second quarter of 2017 and is expected to power phones from Oppo and Vivo as well.. This also indicates that the Nokia 7 and Nokia 8 could also launch sometime in the second quarter as well. There is no certainty on launch or availability of these devices as of yet..

Asha 305, combined with Lumia 620, and a little touch of Nokia 808 PureView (shape of the top and bottom curve). For sub 100€, it looks great. Replying to @ stipe1906 @ JKrkwal and 4 others. Front does take clues from Lumia 610. Replying to @ stipe1906 @ Viccky_maurya7 and 3 others. So micromax is proved to be a copycat again. Replying to @ JKrkwal @ Viccky_maurya7 and 3 others. It's hard not to copy anything originated from Nokia because they released so much stuff over the years. Replying to @ stipe1906 @ Viccky_maurya7 and 3 others. So they copied it but any company would've been shivering while copying N9 design, hard to copy, distinct.. Replying to @ JKrkwal @ stipe1906 and 3 others.

Nokia 7+ Shows Off Bezel-Less Display In Leaked Photo By Adnan Farooqui on 02/18/2018 11:33 PST. HMD Global is one of the many companies that will be launching new handsets at the Mobile World Congress 2018 in Barcelona later this month. The Nokia 7+ will likely be one of the handsets that it unveils at the event. A new hands-on photo of the Nokia 7+ has now surfaced online and it shows off the bezel-less display ofthis device.. The Nokia 7+ follows the Nokia 7 which was launched in October 2017 and has been available on the market for only a few months now.. Aside from the 18:9 aspect ratio 1080×2160 pixel resolution display, this handset is also said to feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor with 4GB of RAM, dual 12 megapixel and 13 megapixel cameras .. The leaked hands-on image of the Nokia 7+ shows off the 18:9 aspect ratio display in all its glory. We can also see that the Nokia branded has been moved to the top right just beside the camera. Given the bezel-less nature of the display, the handset doesn’t have a physical home button and the fingerprint sensor has been moved to the back.. HMD Global is yet to reveal any information about this upcoming device so it’s unclear how much it’s going to cost and when it’s going to be released across the globe. The company will hopefully confirm all that and more at its MWC 2018 event later this month.. Read more about HMD Global , Nokia ..
