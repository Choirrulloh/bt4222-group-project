The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Lite in name, but not in nature. Great to look at and sporting some impressive tech under its hood, the Huawei P8 Lite 2017 is a remarkable phone when you consider the price. The plastic design makes it feel a bit cheap, but then, of course, it is.. Design and display Glass front and back with a plastic frame Bright full HD 5.2-inch display. Huawei sure likes to confuse us when it comes to naming its smartphones. Back in 2015 the Chinese firm released the flagship Huawei P8 , along with a low-cost sibling in the form of the P8 Lite .. We've since had the Huawei P9 and the P9 Lite , not to mention the brand new P10 and P10 Plus , but Huawei has decided to revive the P8 Lite for a second release with this more powerful 2017 edition.. Confused? You may well be, but ultimately what you get here is a stylish mid-range offering powered by an octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 655 chipset and sporting a 1080p 5.2-inch screen, all for less than £200 (around $245/AU$320).. The handset is running Android 7.0 and comes with NFC, as well as a large 3,000mAh battery with fast charging, a fingerprint scanner and dual SIM support, so on paper there’s a lot here for the money, but does it stand up to low-cost rivals like the Lenovo P2 in practice?. While it's hard to argue that any smartphone is truly unique in terms of appearance these days, it's pretty easy to see where Huawei is getting its inspiration from.. The rounded edges of the P8 Lite 2017 instantly call to mind the iPhone 7 , as does the 2.5D "arc" glass used on the screen.. Flip the device over however and it's impossible not to think of the Google Pixel , especially with that rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. It's quite possible that the P8 Lite was in development before either of these handsets broke cover, but there's no denying that it shares a lot of the same design language.. However, while those phones – and Huawei's leading flagships – make use of metal bodywork, the P8 Lite betrays its budget status with a plastic frame.. This runs around the edges of the phone and gives it a slightly cheap feel, but this is mitigated by the fact that it has tempered glass on both the front and the back, calling to mind the LG Nexus 4 from a few years ago.. While we weren't brave enough to conduct our own drop test, it goes without saying that having glass on both sides means you'll ideally want to clad the 2017 P8 Lite in some kind of protective case. Those shiny surfaces are magnets for smudgy fingerprints, too.. Huawei has kept things simple when it comes to inputs. The power and volume buttons are located on the right-hand side of the phone, while the aforementioned fingerprint scanner is on the back.. On the bottom edge there's the micro USB port (not Type-C, we’re sorry to say) and to the right of this is a mono speaker. To the left there's another grille, but we’re assuming this contains the in-call microphone as there's certainly no speaker behind it.. On the top-left edge of the P8 Lite 2017 you'll find the SIM tray, which has two slots – one of which can be used to house a microSD card, if you so wish.. Dual SIM support is a neat extra if you have two different contracts – one for business and one for personal use – but it's something which is more popular in Huawei's native China than over here, at least for the time being. Finally, on the top edge of the phone we have the 3.5mm headphone socket.. Full HD displays aren't that common on smartphones costing less than £200 (around $245/AU$320), which is what makes the P8 Lite's 5.2-inch, 1080 x 1920 resolution screen all the more surprising.. Of course, the number of pixels you can cram into a screen means nothing if the panel isn't up to scratch, but thankfully the display on the P8 Lite 2017 is excellent.. The auto-brightness setting can be somewhat aggressive at times and makes the screen look quite dull, but at full brightness it's positively striking, with bold colours and sharp contrast.

By Kevin Koshy Varghese | 30 Jul 2017. It has very good batteryð stamina but it don't have fastcharge.. Camera clarity is good but it don't focus as fast as iPhone or Samsung mobiles and the front camera ð· is not capable of quick selfies (can't even handle a slight shake of hand). High speed data transfer when using shareIt when compared to other high end mobiles. Hybrid sim slot is almost useless because the internal storage after firmware and system apps is not enough for teenage use(social networks+game+movies+torrent+MUSIC) so having a microSD is a necessity.. For this price(69 KWD),it is a great smartphone for all types of users especially teens.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. Huawei P8 Lite (2017) With Android 7.0 Nougat Launched.

Huawei P8 Lite 2017 review: still a good vintage?. Our review of the Huawei P9 Lite. The fast, fun, affordable Honor 8. Huawei launched the P8 Lite in 2015, then the P9 Lite in 2016. this year, the Chinese company recycled an old name for a new phone with the. launch of the P8 Lite 2017. Huawei, known for its confusing naming schemes, has also opted to call this smartphone the. P9 Lite 2017 or Nova Lite in some markets.. Regardless of the name, this mid-range smartphone's very reasonable $250 price tag should appeal to many users. Huawei P8 lite (2017) release date and price. While the Huawei P8 Lite is already available in some markets, the device hasn't been released in the US. It is available now in the UK for. £185 and in the EU for. €239, which would be equivalent to about $250. The device comes with 3 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage. The available colors are black, white and gold.. is bigger, and its software is more powerful.. Huawei P8 lite (2017) design and build quality. The similarities with Honor 8 are obvious. For this price range, the device is. To the touch, it is easy to confuse the buttons. The P8 Lite 2017 can have either a second SIM card or a MicroSD card. The headphone jack is still here. The Huawei P8 Lite 2017 is a nice smartphone. For this price range, the device is. simply remarkable, in terms of both aesthetics and. However, it is necessary to make some compromises.. So it has a plastic frame rather than a metal one.. The combination of plastic and glass, however, is very successfully executed.. It doesn't feel "cheap" on the black device we reviewed. complaint is that the smartphone is a. Of course, it is impossible not to notice the similarities with the Honor 8, the flagship of Huawei's subsidiary, Honor.. more and more difficult for users to distinguish between the two brands. Adding to the confusion, in some countries, this smartphone is called Honor 8 Lite.. There is no way for users to keep up with these nonsense naming schemes.. Compared to Honor 8, the device is slightly larger, but also lighter by a few grams.. The screen of the Huawei P8 Lite 2017 is also not as. bezel-less as that of Honor 8. Of course, thanks to the curved edges, the smartphone is ergonomic and easy to handle. the back, unlike dual camera of the Honor 8, there is only one camera lens.. For the rest, it's all standard fair: it's got an LED flash, a circular fingerprint reader (which proves to be ultra-fast once again) and the logo of the brand.. As you can see in the following pictures, the volume and power buttons are on the right side, with the SIM card slot opposite.. As with the P9 Lite, it is possible to expand the storage up to 128 GB, or the slot can be used for a second SIM card. You can either expand the storage or insert a second sim card.. On the bottom edge of the device, we find two speaker grilles.. Don't be fooled though, as only one of the two works and. the other is for purely aesthetic reasons.. Between the two grilles, you will find the usual MicroUSB charging port, not Type-C. This is nothing shocking for a mid-range, but in the year 2017, it's maybe. On the top, you'll find a microphone and a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack.. Overall, the design and build quality. of the P8 Lite 2017 is one of its best assets.. The similarities with the Honor 8 are a bit too. The screen of the P8 Lite 2017 is one of the good satisfactions of the smartphone. For the display, Huawei has reused a recipe that works.. The P8 Lite 2017 has a 5.2-inch. IPS screen with a Full-HD resolution and a pixel density of 424 ppi.. If you are not a fan of virtual reality , the Full HD definition is more than sufficient on a daily basis.. In any case, a higher definition would have been surprising given that the flagship of the same brand has. Of course, an IPS LCD screen doesn't compare with the vibrancy. or depth of an AMOLED screen.. But, the colors remain warm and natural.. In any case, it is possible to change the color temperature according to your own tastes. And finally, I had no complaints about visibility or viewing angles. Even outdoors, it is very easy to read text on the screen.. For a smartphone at about $250, the display. of the Huawei P8 Lite 2017 is very good and not likely to be subject to criticism.. The P8 Lite 2017 runs Nougat.. The software is certainly the biggest problem with the Huawei P8 Lite 2017. The Chinese manufacturer may have had good intentions initially, but in practice, it. is rather disappointing and sometimes ruins the overall user experience of smartphone.. On the whole, this disappointed me.. Android 7.0 Nougat, with the latest version Huawei's interface,. On paper, compared to the Honor 6X, it has a distinct advantage since the smartphone offers all the many novelties of EMUI 5.0.. There are new features from Android. Nougat (multi-window mode, new notifications, etc.) but also the default presence of an application drawer, new multitasking and an overall appearance. closer to stock Android than iOS.. When it comes to daily use, it seems that Huawei has really neglected software optimization. The result: slow downs, some bugs and a lack of fluidity if you overload the memory, which happens quickly with just 3 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage.. In my opinion, the Chinese manufacturer didn't want to make the same mistake it made with the Honor 6X by offering the old version of Android (Marshmallow). The engineers responsible for the development of the P8 Lite 2017 probably ran. out of time to optimize the software with the hardware.. This is made all the more unfortunate since the system occupies 6.55 GB of the 16 GB available.. If you add some apps (the Huawei P8 Lite 2017 already has a lot of bloatware that can't be removed), the memory gets used up quickly which slows the software interface down even more.. Fortunately, one of the methods I have found to get a little more breathing room and. fluidity is to use a MicroSD card for installing applications and keeping the internal memory only for the system.. Here is the Huawei P8 Lite 2017.. I find it unfortunate that Huawei has not made the effort to add more internal memory. Under the hood, the Huawei P8 Lite 2017 has similar specs to the Honor 6X.. So, there's an octacore HiSilicon Kirin 655 16nm processor, with 4 cores operating at. 2.1 GHz and four others at 1.7 GHz, along with a Mali-T83 graphics chip and 3 GB of RAM.. The smartphone also has 16 GB of internal storage, expandable by MicroSD card.. As I said before, I find it unfortunate that Huawei has not made the effort to add more internal memory.. Certainly, at about $250, we must make some compromises, but if it is to the detriment of user experience in the end, it is a bit of a shame.. slowdowns on a daily basis, I was paradoxically pleasantly surprised by its scores on the various benchmark tests.. Graphics performance is also up to par, and the Huawei P8 Lite 2017 is not weak.. Games run with minimum detail and no lag.. During our tests, we were able to take some benchmarks.. There is only one loudspeaker (located under the grille on the right). The mono speaker is one of the curiosities of the Huawei P8 Lite 2017. Despite the presence of two grilles, only one loudspeaker is present (on the right).. Unlike the Galaxy A3 (2017) , this one is located on the lower part of the smartphone.. of covering it when you hold your smartphone in both portrait and landscape mode is. The sound quality is adequate for watching media content. The small speaker of the Huawei P8 Lite 2017 is very capable. It is louder than that of the Honor 8 and P9 Lite. The sound becomes distorted and metallic at high volume, but in noisy environments, it makes itself heard.. Headphones also come in the box. Finally, regarding the call quality, I did not encounter any problems with the P8 Lite 2017. The person I called could hear me without issue, and vice versa.. The P8 Lite 2017 offers a 12 MP camera. You'll find the interface familiar if you've used a Huawei or Honor smartphone before.. Photos taken with the Huawei P8 Lite 2017. As explained earlier, the Huawei P8 Lite 2017 offers a single 12 MP camera with an f / 2.0 aperture.. An LED flash and a phase detection auto focus are also part of the deal.. Note that you can use the volume buttons to take snapshots.. Although it may be useful for some people, I have occasionally taken photos unintentionally.. There are many modes: Pro photo mode, HDR mode, panorama, slow motion, time lapse. The pictures are taken very quickly, and the focus is fast.. It's a bit better than the P9 Lite, for example.. Those who have already used a Huawei or Honor smartphone will be in familiar terrain, since the camera application is indeed the same.. In terms of quality, when the lighting conditions are decent, the camera of the P8 Lite 2017 proves rather good.. In low light conditions, it is less obvious. but Huawei has made efforts, as. its sensor is able to capture more light than before.. Either way, you can always adjust the aperture or exposure with the smartphone's Pro (manual) mode.. The 8 MP front camera (f / 2.0) also gives satisfactory results, at least for taking selfies.. On the video side, it is possible to shoot in Full HD.. the default resolution is set to. is more talented than most of its competitors, with the exception of the Moto G4 Plus .. In my comparative tests, the P9 Lite is better than the P8 Lite 2017 for some details but the difference is quite difficult to distinguish.. You can get an idea for yourself by checking out our photos:. Huawei mixes new and old for this smartphone. The Huawei P8 Lite 2017 has a non-removable 3,000 mAh battery. This is average for 5.2-inch smartphones, especially taking the Full HD IPS screen into account.. Since the smartphone runs Nougat, it theoretically benefits from the power management features of the latest Android update.. In terms of battery life, Huawei does not disappoint us with this smartphone.. You get a good day of battery life with normal use,. that is to say: a few calls, some videos, surfing and messaging.. With less frequent use, you can even reach a day and a half.. It is even possible to activate the battery saver mode in the settings to extend the life of your smartphone.. It is always good to use this feature. when you know that your smartphone doesn't charge quickly.. It takes more than two hours to get a total charge.. a score of 6:45 while connected. to Wi-Fi, with a single SIM and brightness set to 75 percent.. For a device of this range, this.

The Huawei P8 Lite 2017, which was the big surprise from. the Chinese manufacturer at CES 2017, is finally a. My biggest complaint is that the. so it spoils the user experience in the end.. However, the smartphone certainly doesn't lack positive qualities, starting with a seductive design that will appeal to users.. Its battery life and sound quality are also great. Even though you can't get a carrier subsidy for this phone in the US, $250 is still a very accessible price point. Compared to the original P8 Lite, it is a clear improvement.. However, I have a little difficulty understanding. the Chinese manufacturer's desire to ride the success of the P8 Lite by releasing this smartphone with its name.. even if the smartphone isn't bad and will suit most users, I can only advise people looking for a mid-range smartphone to turn to its competitors, like the Honor 6X , the P9 Lite. or even wait for future smartphones from Huawei instead.. the Huawei P8 Lite 2017?

Huawei P8 Lite 2017 Smartphone Review. Florian Wimmer ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 02/18/2017. ARM Android Smartphone Touchscreen. Huawei's P8 lite was actually the slimmed down version of Huawei's second-last flagship phone. Nevertheless, it has now been reworked with a new design, Full HD panel, and many other improvements. Our report reveals whether the P8 lite (2017) is a good deal..

For the original German review, see here .. 2015 was an eventful year: The spacecraft "New Horizons" reached Pluto, VW admitted that they had been dishonest about their diesel engines, Stefan Raab quit his TV career, and Huawei launched the. as a small, slimmed down version of its. Almost two years later both smartphones are still being retailed. Not a bad performance in this fast-paced market. Perhaps Huawei has decided to introduce a successor of the mid-range model in the form of the P8 lite (2017) just for this reason. It comes with a Full HD screen, 3 GB of RAM, and a much bigger battery, making it considerably more up-to-date than its predecessor. The phones also look very different. Only the recommended retail price of 240 Euros (~$255) for Huawei's P8 lite (2017) is very similar to that of its predecessor, and it is thus situated in the mid-range.. We compare the latest P8 lite with its predecessor alongside three other mid-range models: Asus' Zenfone 3 Max , HTC's One A9s , and Lenovo's ZUK Z2 .. HiSilicon Kirin 655 ARM Mali-T830 MP2.

As said, the casing of Huawei's P8 lite (2017) has been completely redesigned and has little in common with the. Our review sample's design looks very organic thanks to the 2.5D glass on the front and the curved edges. The glossy glass back looks stylish and, like the front, it is difficult to keep clean: Fingerprints and dust accumulate quickly. Furthermore, the smartphone slides on even slightly slanted surfaces and could fall from a table accidentally. The smartphone is available in black, gold, and white. A blue model is mentioned on the website, but it does not seem to be available in Europe.. Huawei's P8 lite (2017) has a slightly bigger screen of 5.2 inches, and thus both the casing and the weight have increased. However, our present review sample is marginally slimmer than the 2015. P8 lite : We still measured 7.6 millimeters (~0.3 in) here.. Pressure on the screen is visible in the liquid crystals for a moment, but it does not leave prolonged pressure marks. The handset easily defies pressure on the back. Huawei's P8 lite (2017) can be warped slightly, which produces quiet cracking noises. In total, the casing makes a high-quality and solid impression. The selected glass and metal materials correspond to the category standard.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. With 3 GB of working memory and 16 GB of storage, Huawei's P8 lite (2017) is up-to-date. However, some smartphones offer even higher storage capacities in this category. The USB port is not implemented in the USB-C format, and it only supports USB 2.0 speeds. At least it allows connecting external storage devices via USB OTG.. Two SIM cards can be inserted into Huawei's P8 lite (2017); a single-SIM version also exists on the market, but it is presently not available in Europe. The storage can be expanded by up to 128 GB via a micro-SD card but in favor of one SIM slot. Apps can be moved to the SD card although Huawei takes a different approach than some other manufacturers: Either the internal storage or the micro-SD card is selected as the standard storage. When the SD card is selected, data from compatible apps are moved to the SD card automatically and future apps, photos, and data are stored there. App2SD does not have to selected for every individual app. The card cannot be formatted as internal storage, and thus it can still be used with other devices.. Huawei's Emotion UI 5 visibly modifies the looks of Android 7, but it is a bit more flexible than Google's stock Android: For example, the user can launch "Basic Mode" that facilitates use when large icons or only few functions are needed. It is also possible to decide whether all apps are displayed on the home screen or whether app drawers are used and arranged like the menu buttons. At first glance, the system makes a somewhat fragmented impression due to the small font size, but this can be changed in the settings and the text then becomes legible also for users with weaker eyesight. However, some app labels are cut off under the icon.. Thanks to the preloaded "HiCare" app, it is possible to quickly access Huawei's service offers or open instructions concerning the smartphone. "HiGame" contains some basic mobile games for downloading, and a phone manager provides security and cleaning features. Useful tools, such as a compass or file manager, are found in the tool folder. However, some affiliate apps, such as "Gameloft", "TripAdvisor", and "Twitter", are also preloaded.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Huawei's P8 lite (2017) offers relatively fast LTE Cat. 6 at a maximum download speed of 300 Mbit/s and maximum upload of 50 Mbit/s. Thanks to four GPRS, four UMTS, and five LTE frequencies, it should always be possible to find a network (at least in European countries). The reception within a rural area was usually good: We also usually had four of five bars indoors in the well-developed German Vodafone network. Conveniently, SIM cards can be inserted and removed on the fly.. The Wi-Fi standards are limited: Only 802.11 b/g/n are offered. Consequently, the less-frequented 5-GHz band cannot be used.. provides a few more options, and. that is difficult to acquire here even supports the high-speed 802.11 ac standard. Our review sample delivers acceptable though not outstanding Wi-Fi transmission rates, as we discovered in our standardized Wi-Fi test. It achieved a transmission speed of around 54 MBit/s in send and receive.. HTC's One A9s , for example, offers twice the speed. The reception near the router was good in practice; websites opened relatively fast. Half the signal strength was still displayed at a distance of ten meters (~33 ft) and through three walls, but websites opened just as fast..

Huawei's P8 lite (2017) could not locate us indoors, but an accuracy of up to 5 meters (~16.4 ft) is quickly reached outdoors. We performed our practical tracking test, where we take the smartphone and a professional navigation system by Garmin, by car this time. We compared the outcomes of both devices with the "Runtastic" app.. The recorded route only deviates by 60 meters (~197 ft), which is a very good rate over almost ten kilometers (6.2 miles). The GPS module in Huawei's smartphone sometimes takes shortcuts when it loses the signal between two measuring points, but Garmin's Edge 500 navigation system does this, too. Huawei's module is even a bit better than the professional device on serpentine streets. In total, it is an impressive outcome for a GPS module in a mid-range smartphone. Consequently, the tracker can also be used for more demanding excursions.. GPS Huawei P8 lite (2017): Total. GPS Huawei P8 lite (2017): Traffic circle. GPS Huawei P8 lite (2017): Bends.

Huawei has actually reworked the phone app. However, it basically supports the same functions as Google's stock app. We liked the fact that the call list can be filtered according to categories, such as missed or unknown. The harassment filter is also a convenient tool for warding off unwanted calls.. The earpiece can get quite loud, but the higher its volume the less clear it becomes and it then starts to roar. We liked it most at medium volume although the call quality was also only mediocre then. The microphone had problems recording quiet voices and we also sounded muffled to our contact. Our contact sounded relatively good in hands-free mode, and the microphone can even record quieter speech. However, we still sounded a bit muffled to our contact.. A small surprise: Huawei offers even fewer megapixels in its P8 lite (2017) primary camera than in its predecessor: now only 12 megapixels in contrast to 13 megapixels. However, this is not necessarily a step backward as Huawei relies on extra big pixels of 1.25 micrometers in order to capture more light. The autofocus also responds particularly quickly. We can confirm that the camera shoots well-exposed photos that still depict depth in both dark and bright areas, which is not a bad outcome. The outlines could be sharper; an intentionally blurred background often looks artificial. Subjectively, the primary camera definitely takes good photos for a mid-range smartphone in total.. Videos can be recorded in 1080p at 30 frames per second with the rear-facing camera. The exposure here is very good and adapts quickly to changing light conditions. The image sharpness is also good, and we quite like the results in total. A marginal note: The user has to take particular care not to cover the camera with a finger when holding the smartphone due to its position in the upper left corner.. The 8-megapixel, front-facing camera has a considerably higher resolution than Huawei's 2015. However, the photos are rather mediocre with visible color noise, bright areas quickly look overexposed, and they do not really look sharp. It should be acceptable for an occasional selfie, but it is not enough for really high-quality photos.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. The analysis of the rear-facing camera also delivered good results under defined light conditions in our photo studio. Colored surfaces look relatively homogeneous and not too grainy. However, the sharpness decreases slightly toward the edges. The sharpness is good in the image center. Colors are reproduced well, but most tones are a bit too light compared to the reference color space.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. Huawei's P8 lite (2017) comes with a charger, USB cable, and a SIM tool for opening the slot. A cabled headset is also included. Special accessories are not found on Huawei's website.. Huawei offers the 24-month manufacturer's warranty in the EU.. Huawei preloads the third-party keyboard app "SwiftKey". Although it offers many configuration options, it is not very well-arranged since the keys often have multiple assignments. In return, the individual letters and numbers are mapped on large buttons. Voice input, swipe and a dictionary are also present.. The touchscreen has a very sleek surface and is thus very slippery. Whether or not the user likes it is a matter of taste. In any case, the touchscreen is very accurate and functions very precisely even in the corners. The menu keys are displayed on the screen. The volume control and standby button are on the casing's right as expected.. A highlight is certainly the fingerprint scanner. Although it has become standard in this price range, the fingerprint scanner in Huawei's P8 lite (2017) is extremely fast and accurate. The screen unlocks within fractions of a second after touching the area on the smartphone's back.. The 16:9 screen in Huawei's P8 lite (2017) has a Full HD resolution that is not at all a matter of course in this price range. The IPS panel has a 5.2-inch size and an unusually high brightness of 559 cd/mÂ². The illumination of 91 percent is also very homogeneous, and thus colored surfaces look evenly bright.. 556 cd/m² 572 cd/m² 570 cd/m² 556 cd/m² 575 cd/m² 569 cd/m² 526 cd/m² 555 cd/m² 555 cd/m². 91 % Center on Battery: 575. cd/m²) ΔE Color 5.2 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 7.2 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 93.7% sRGB (Calman) Gamma: 2.4.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. Although the black level of 0.38 cd/mÂ² is not a top rate, it is still better than in most comparison devices. Dark areas have a light grayish tint. The contrast ratio of 1474:1 is nevertheless very good thanks to the high brightness, and colors thus look fairly vivid. The screen has a blue filter mode that reduces eyestrain. This is achieved via the white balance that can also be readjusted manually. This is recommended since the image looks very yellowish otherwise.. We examine the image reproduction ex-factory, and in the cool and warm white balance with the CalMAN software and spectrophotometer. A color tint is always present; the white balance only changes the color. The tint is green in a very warm white balance and blue in a very cool setting. The default setting exhibits the lowest color deviations compared to the sRGB color space. Depending on the setting, the sRGB color space is covered from 93.3 to 93.7 percent. This will be too little for professionals especially since the color tint cannot be completely eliminated. Normal users should not depend too much on the screen's colors, either..

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The screen's very high maximum brightness allows using the smartphone outdoors on brighter days. However, the glossy screen is often an annoyance here. The viewing angles are very good; the images on the screen are still very clear even from a very flat angle.. HiSilicon's Kirin 655 is the installed SoC. It has a considerably higher clock rate than the Kirin 620 in the predecessor and is a variant of the Kirin 650 with a slightly higher clock rate in one of the processor's two clusters. They consist of four cores each and clock at a maximum of 1.7 GHz and 2.1 GHz. The SoC supports 64 bits and belongs to the mid-range. Compared with the predecessor, its performance has been notably increased from 20 to 50 percent depending on the benchmark. Huawei's P8 lite (2017) is also quite fast compared with comparable modern smartphones.. An ARM Mali-T830 MP2 graphics chip that clocks at 900 MHz is installed.

The Internet browsing performance of Huawei's P8 lite (2017) is also very fast - at least in the category comparison. Huawei's smartphone is on par with HTC's One A9s , and Lenovo's ZUK Z2 is naturally even faster thanks to its upper-range SoC.

Accessing an inserted micro-SD card was faster than with the comparison devices in our test, at least according to the tests performed with our Toshiba reference card. High-end smartphones, such as Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge , achieve considerably more with the micro-SD card.. Accessing the internal storage was also quickly possible in the category comparison. No matter whether write or read, the Huawei's P8 lite (2017) scored well and even placed itself clearly before Lenovo's ZUK Z2 in random access..

The app "GameBench" helps us determine the frame rates in order to see just how smooth games run on the review sample. We discovered smooth frame rates are not always possible with very high details in demanding games. In " Asphalt 8 ", a fast-pace racing game, the details had to be lowered for achieving 30 frames per second. Slight performance drops that reduced the average frame rate to 29 frames were recorded in " Dead Trigger 2 ". We did not record more than 30 frames per second in the test. The manufacturer has apparently set a limit. Of course, performance problems were not observed in basic games, such as " Angry Birds ".. Navigation via touchscreen and position sensor functioned very reliably.. We did not feel a real temperature increase on the review sample even during full load. The handset always remained cool and only reached a maximum of 33 Â°C (91.4 Â°F) on the back during prolonged load. The idle temperatures were only marginally lower.. The performance remained stable after repeated load as our test with GFXBench battery test shows: The same sequence is rendered thirty times in succession here. The frame rates of the first runs are very low. Then they increase and settle to a higher rate than at initiation. In total, it can be said that the performance can vary but this does not seem due to the system's temperature. The performance fluctuations of almost 10 percent are not tremendous anyway.. 32 °C 29.8 °C 30.4 °C. 32.8 °C 30.3 °C 33 °C. 31.9 °C 30.3 °C 31.9 °C.

However, music sounds a bit tinny at maximum volume. Not much bass is audible, but songs and voices in videos sound good, which could be due to the well-balanced mid-range. The sound at medium volume is relatively good and clearer than at maximum volume. The speaker's sound quality reminds us of that in Huawei's former P8 lite in total..

Frequency diagram in comparison (checkboxes above can be turned on/off!). The high standby consumption rate shocked us at first. Huawei's P8 lite (2017) allegedly consumes 0.82 watts, which means that the battery would be depleted in almost 14 hours when it is just idling. We can, however, give the all clear here: The battery capacity only reduced slightly even after a few days on the table. It is apparently an error in measurement.. Otherwise, the consumption rates, especially while idling, i.e. without explicit load, are relatively high in the category comparison. Zenfone 3 Max , for example, is considerably more frugal here. This might also be due to the higher resolution screen in Huawei's P8 lite (2017). The manufacturer provides the option of reducing the resolution for saving energy when desired.. Then again, our review sample is more restrained during load and is almost frugal compared with other devices in this category. Thus, it depends on how the smartphone is used: When it is often idle, it will consume more power than the comparison devices, but the user will find a more energy-saving handset when games or similarly demanding tasks are performed..

Compared with the predecessor, the battery capacity has been increased considerably to now 3000 mAh or 11.4 Wh. Huawei's P8 lite (2017) thus achieves a much longer battery life than its predecessor. The user can browse the Internet via Wi-Fi for a bit over 10 hours, which is a good rate that most comparison devices do not achieve. with its gigantic battery can outrun the review sample. 4:43 hours of load are a very impressive rate for Huawei's P8 lite (2017).. The handset will only have to be recharged daily when used very often or intensely.

In review: Huawei P8 Lite (2017). Although the decision to reiterate the slimmed version of the former flagship is unusual, the manufacturer has created more than just a competitive mid-range smartphone with the Huawei P8 lite (2017). Our review sample surpasses its predecessor, the. Huawei P8 lite , in many aspects and can even compete with more expensive devices in some sectors. First to be mentioned would be the very fast and accurate fingerprint scanner that is hardly found otherwise in a 250 Euro (~$264) device. The screen has a higher resolution than common in this category, but without much of an impact on battery life: Two workdays without recharging are quite easily possible in practice. The smartphone's performance is good and the handset hardly heats up at the same time.. The call quality is only mediocre, and the speaker will hardly convince a real music fan. The bright and low-contrast screen unfortunately has a visible color tint, and recharging takes a very long time. The casing is too slippery for slanted surfaces and the smartphone could fall to the ground.. Huawei introduces an overall successful update of its mid-range smartphone with the P8 lite (2017). It was worthwhile to take this unusual approach and reconfigure the almost forgotten smartphone with a better screen, good battery life, and a considerable performance boost.. Huawei makes up for the smartphone's shortcomings with the aforementioned plus points alongside a very accurate GPS module and decent configuration. Thus, we give Huawei's P8 lite (2017) a purchase recommendation.. Huawei P8 lite 2017 - 2017-02-13 02/13/2017 v6 Florian Wimmer. Read all 2 comments / answer.

Huawei P8 Lite 2017 Review: Huawei’s first affordable phone of the year is a revamped version of the P8 Lite, and for just £185 in the UK it’s a seriously strong rival to similar budget blowers. Here’s our full Huawei P8 Lite 2017 review.. We’re only two months into 2017 and already Huawei has launched two very good budget mobiles. The Chinese giant started the year strong with the Honor 6X , a solid 5.5-inch phone boasting a dual-lens rear camera for just over £200. And if that’s not enough for you, have a bit of the Huawei P8 Lite 2017.. This 5.2-inch phone costs under £200, making it even cheaper than the Honor 6X, yet still crams in some solid specs. You get a Full HD screen, the latest version of Android and loads of bonus Huawei features, giving impressive value for money.. Here’s everything you need to know after I used the P8 Lite 2017 as my full-time handset for several days.. Read next: Huawei P8 Lite 2017 vs Honor 6X, what’s the difference?. These days more and more phones are launching with a sexy glass finish, something popularised by the likes of the Samsung Galaxy flagship handsets. Huawei dipped its toe in the glossy waters with the Honor 8 and now the P8 Lite 2017 continues what could be an aesthetically pleasing trend.. The P8 Lite’s matt edging gives way to a shiny glass back which looks cool (in our eyes at least) and stands out from the rest of the plastic and metal crowd. Sure, it does pick up greasy prints and marks when handled, but not to the extent of other phones like the HTC U Play. Besides, it’s nothing a quick spit and polish won’t sort.. At 5.2-inches the P8 Lite 2017 is quite easy to handle with a single hand. You’ll most likely struggle to stretch your thumb up to the top of the screen, but thankfully Huawei’s Emotion UI offers ways around this (see the features and OS section for more info).. At the £200 price point you can’t pick up too many Full HD phones just yet, with the Moto G4 Plus and Lenovo P2 being two of your only options in the UK. Now you can add the P8 Lite 2017 to that (short) list. And it’s cheaper than both of them.. The P8 Lite 2017’s 5.2-inch screen boasts a 1920×1080 resolution, so visuals are gorgeously crisp. Great news if you enjoy catching up on shows and movies on the go. Colours are reasonably punchy, breathing life into photos and the rest. And if you pump up the brightness levels, you’ll easily be able to see through the most irritating of glare.. Huawei has also added an ‘eye comfort’ mode, which filters out blue light for an easy-on-the-eye viewing experience. This is best used at night, so the screen seems less harsh when turned on. You can manually activate eye comfort at any time, or – more usefully – have it automatically switch on at a set time.. Got a big media collection? No worries, the not-very-spacious 16GB of internal storage can be boosted with a microSD memory card, giving up to 256GB more space.. We’re pleased to see the latest version of Android packed into the P8 Lite 2017, so we don’t have to hang around ages for all those lovely Google updates. And to sweeten the deal even more, you get the latest version of Huawei’s own Emotion UI, EMUI 5.0.. We’ve already covered what makes Huawei’s Emotion UI so great in our full EMUI 5.0 review ,. so go check that out if you want to know everything about this feature-packed overlay. If you can’t be bothered with that, all you need to know is that EMUI adds some bonus customisation and resource management tools to Android.. For instance, Huawei has added some one-handed functions, including the ability to shrink the screen or pull down the notifications bar with a new toolbar button. You can easily check how much memory is being used by your apps, as well as keep tabs on battery hogs. And you can even change up the screen transitions and activate gesture support, if that’s your bag.. On the back of the P8 Lite 2017 you’ll find a circular fingerprint sensor, sunk into the middle of the plate. When you pick up the phone you’ll find your index pinkie lands right on that sensor, so you can tap and unlock in no time at all. It’s impressively fast to recognise and act, rarely throwing up an error message.. The P8 Lite 2017 packs the same Kirin 655 processor as the Honor 6X, as well as 3GB of RAM. And as with the Honor 6X, everyday performance is pretty smooth for a budget device.. We had no problem playing reasonably demanding action titles with a solid frame rate, while apps loaded with very little lag. It’s rare to see a stutter or any other irritations, and you can happily edit photos or stream HD footage just fine.. For the more tech-savvy of our readers, the P8 Lite 2017 spat out an AnTuTu score of 57k – a serious step up from the Moto G4 Plus’ 45k, although not quite as strong as the Lenovo P2’s 63k result.. Battery life is another strong point. We managed close to two days of use per charge, even with some quite demanding use. That includes a couple of calls, lots of messaging, the odd bit of video streaming and so on.. Sadly the charging port is USB 2.0, not Type C, so you don’t get the super-fast data transfer or reversible cable head. Still, it’s a small quibble considering the value for money on offer.. The P8 Lite 2017 doesn’t have a funky dual-lens rear camera like the Honor 6X, but we really like the 12-megapixel snapper.. It’s a feature-dense mobile shooter with impressive flexibility, which can capture sharp photos in most conditions. And while it’s definitely not infallible, the P8 Lite 2017 will be more than good enough for those treasured family photos.. You can also shoot up to Full HD video footage, while the front-facing 8-megapixel camera is another solid snapper..

Huawei P8 lite 2017 is rated. Rated 1 out of. Warning! You cannot expand memory with SD card. It was all going really well until the memory started running out. Got an SD card and did the usual formatting etc to expand the memory. Turns out Huawei have disabled the "move apps" option so you basically can't use your SD to expand internal memory. Totally useless phone - I now can't install the apps I want. I don't even want that many! There is so much bloatware preinstalled that you can't get rid of. So I'm left with a load of apps I don't want and no space for basics like Train times, Twitter, FB etc.. I've spent hours in forums reading similar complaints from others and none of them have found a solution that doesn't involve rooting the phone.. I've had the phone for less than a month and already it's useless. Constantly warning me the memory is running low and refusing to use the SD even though it's all set up correctly. My old Wileyfox was better than this.. And because it took over 14 days for me to discover how useless it is, Carphone Warehouse have refused to take it back. Rated 5 out of. I was given this as a birthday present recently. And I am so glad I was. I had a HTC before and to say this phone is far better is a understatement. The speed difference and battery life was worth the change on it's own. Even though I am still trying all the things the phone does at the moment. I am very happy with this phone and would recommend it to anyone.. Rated 5 out of. I purchased the phone for a present for my son's birthday upon opening and handling the phone I decided I preferred it more than my HTC and went and purchased another.. The P8 Lite is a nest nifty well packed phone with plenty of feature including fingerprint security, quad core processor and 3gb ram more than plenty to run games that my HTC struggled with.. GPS signal for me has been second to none accurate to with a couple of meters and has never lagged.. I'm disappointed that the P8 Lite 2017 does actually support a second sim when placed inside the SD SLOT however carphone warehouse seem to have disabled this feature for some unknown reason.. The battery life is great for me previously my HTC would require 2 charges throughout the day the P8 however manages to last almost 36 hours without charge and being a busy on the move person who uses the phone for business throughout the day I'm very impressed.. It's always been responsive sound quality of the speaker is great.. The only flaw I can find is charging time seems to take longer than I would like but again battery life seems to last so it's not really an issue for me. I compared the P8 Lite to the P8 and p10 and found this was just as suitable atva price I would be happy to pay.. If fairness I think the phone is underpriced I would have happily paid £249.. Rated 1 out of. Made sure it had an SD card slot so I could move moveable apps to it. But when I tried there was NO option to move even if it said moveable. So then I rang the Huawei helpline and it asked to press key 1, 2, 3 etc for options - nothing registered so had to phone on my wife's Samsung - fine recognised the keypad! Huawei told me that they had disabled app moving! TERRIBLE! So then I rang my wife's phone and send some keystrokes. They were strangely broken bip-beeep which was why the keypad options didn't register! When she send keystrokes they were a constant BEEEP. So what use is a phone that has an SD card but cant move apps - memory will soon be full. And a keypad that wont register options when asked? I'm off for a refund tomorrow and change to trusty SAMSUNG!. If you find cheper deal than ours,We'll match it and pay your first monthly bill..

Moto G4 Read our full Moto G4 review Lenovo P2 Read our full Lenovo P2 review Xiaomi Mi5 Read our full Xiaomi Mi5 review. Mid-to-low range Android phones have certainly come a long way in a relatively short space of time, but the P8 Lite 2017 represents a real step forward for this price bracket. The full HD screen is excellent, the Kirin 655 chipset offers plenty of power and the 3,000mAh battery can deliver over a day of decent usage.. The downsides are low internal storage and the plastic frame, but neither of these really impact the phone's appeal too greatly, and in the case of the former you can always use one of the SIM card slots to install a microSD card for extra storage.. For under £200 (around $245/AU$320) the P8 Lite is something of a bargain.. If you've looked in envy at top-tier Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7 and HTC 10 but have baulked at paying such a large sum of money, then the Huawei P8 Lite 2017 is definitely for you.. While it doesn’t challenge those devices in every aspect of its feature set, it offers a premium-feel experience which makes the modest price tag all the more surprising.. If you don't mind a plastic-framed handset – and having to shell out for a near-essential microSD card – then the P8 Lite 2017 comes very highly recommended indeed.. Opting for a budget-price phone usually means compromising on some features, but outside of bleeding edge stuff – like 4K video recording for example – the Huawei P8 Lite 2017 feels like it's supplying a premium experience, but at a fraction of the price.. The Huawei P8 Lite 2017 is competitively priced, but there's no shortage of similarly accomplished phones in this bracket, such as the following three.. One of the few other budget Androids which boasts a full HD screen, the Moto G4 also runs Android Nougat, and it’s a near vanilla version of the OS, which is the purest and arguably best way to experience it.. All that and it’s even slightly cheaper than the Huawei P8 Lite 2017, but it lacks a fingerprint scanner and NFC, making the P8 Lite a slightly more attractive proposition overall.. Another low-cost Android phone with a 1080p screen, the Lenovo P2's display really is worth writing home about and the metal design is really eye-catching.. It also has a massive battery, giving it several days of life, but the camera is disappointing and it's something of a beast in terms of overall weight. Still, if you’re not a big smartphone snapper it’s well worth considering instead of the P8 Lite 2017.. If you don't mind ordering your phone direct from China and jumping through some hoops to set it up, then the Mi5 is another worthy alternative to the P8 Lite 2017.. It has a powerful Snapdragon 820 chipset, 1080p screen, fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C, which makes for almost flagship specs, all for a mid-range price. It’s the better phone, but it’s also a bit more expensive and not as easy to get.. Prev Page Battery life and camera.

The Huawei P8 Lite (2017) currently has an Informr score of 8 out of 10.. This score is based on our evaluation of 8. sources including reviews from users and the web's most trusted critics.. What's good Sharp, dazzling screen Good battery life Sleek design Excellent price point. What's bad Glass back attracts smudges and scratches Poor color representation in display Lack of detail and no optical image stabilization in camera. Huawei doesn’t believe in traditional numbering for their Lite line. The P8 Lite is actually much newer and more expensive than the P9 Lite. That aside, what makes the P8 Lite stand out is its budget price for decent specs. However, with so many other manufacturers fighting over the budget smartphone market, is the P8 Lite worth a second look?. Let’s see what reviewers have to say!. It’s difficult to call any smartphone design unique with so many options available today. Still, the P8 Lite does offers some “cool” points with its rounded edges, 2.5D “arc” front glass and glass back.. As a budget phone, it ditches the aluminum for a faux-metal treatment to the plastic casing. Despite the plastic, experts were impressed with its overall solid build quality. With that said, after a couple days they noticed the rear glass accumulated smudges and scratches.. The 5.2-inch display offers a resolution of 1920-by-1080 for a pixel density of 424ppi. This sharpness combined with its excellent contrast impressed reviewers. But its brightness really blew them away. Many called it one of the brightest screens on the market. This brightness, combined with IPS display technology, provided them with excellent viewing angles.. The biggest downside, like the 2016 P8 Lite , is its poor color representation. This led to murky and dull images.. The internal specs are a bit more impressive than the screen. Armed with an octa-core processor (4 x 2.1GHz and 4 x 1.7GHz) and 3GB of RAM, the P8 Lite is no slouch in the performance department. Critics experienced no lag or stutters during day-to-day activities or when playing graphic-intensive games.. With that said, Tech Radar noticed apps loaded slowly during their first two days of use, though it sped up after that for unknown reasons.. An octa-core processor and HD display are hard on battery life. It’s one reason Huawei opted for the 3,000mAh battery.

Huawei P8 Lite (2017) vs Huawei P9 Lite: the clash of two mid-range devices. Huawei P8 Lite (2017) r eview: still a good vintage?. Huawei P9 Lite recensione: t he lightweight competitor. Released several months apart, the Huawei P8 Lite (2017) and the P9 Lite are two mid-range smartphones from the Chinese manufacturer which have many similarities, but also many of differences which, at first glance, maybe aren’t apparent.. Here’s an in-depth comparison to help you decide between the two smartphones.. The P9 Lite reminds me more of the P8 generation, whereas the P8 Lite (2017) reminds me more of the P10 range.. The P9 Lite is slightly bigger than the P8 Lite 2017. Which device do you think has a more top-range look? / © AndroidPIT. P8 Lite (2017) to the left, P9 Lite to the right.

How to calibrate the battery on your Android phone. No quick charge, but both devices have a battery that won’t let you down! / © AndroidPIT. A ndroid battery problems and solutions. Both the P8 Lite (2017) and the P9 Lite have beautiful designs. While the first seems to reflect the design of the P10 generation, the second is a reminder of the P8's design. The P9 Lite has more squared angles than the P8 Lite (2017), it doesn’t offer the bezel-less. effect that you find on the P8 Lite (2017), and a housing. in the plain style of the P8 with a camera module. The P8 Lite 2017 device’s body is just as solid as that of the P9 Lite, with thanks to the more squared angles and a less smooth polycarbonate casing. The differences in size are minimal (147.2 x 72.94 x 7.6 mm compared to 146.8 x 72.6 x 7.5 mm for the P9 Lite). The loud speaker (mono), the volume and power buttons, the Nano SIM and SD card (or double SIM card) slots, the Type-C USB port as well as the headphone socket, are located identically on both devices.. You’ll find a fingerprint reader on both smartphones – circular in shape on the P8 Lite (2017) and square in shape on the P9 Lite – which work well: they are fast even if you touch them with different parts of your finger. Although the P9 Lite doesn’t collect as many fingerprint marks as its rival, the P8 Lite (2017) has a more top-range look. This is achieved with the glass panels at the front and back, the 2.5D screen and a plastic casing, whereas the P9 Lite has a metal casing, plastic panel on the back and a glass panel on the front.. The glass-plastic combination, although it collects more fingerprint marks, is more attractive than the P9 Lite’s polycarbonate casing. For this reason, regarding the physical appearance of the two smartphones, I think that the P8 Lite (2017) is the clear winner.. On paper, the devices are twins. The screens on both the P8 Lite (2017) and the P9 Lite have a diagonal measurement of 5.2-inches, 1080 x 1920 pixel. Full-HD resolution with LCD IPS technology, and display clear, detailed images. On the other hand, upon increasing the brightness to the maximum, it’s important to note that the P8 Lite (2017) has a brighter, more detailed screen with more vivid contrasts. As you can see from the screenshots below, both devices are displaying the same wallpaper and the result is far superior on the P8 Lite (2017).. The visual angles are good on both devices. In sunlight, you won’t see a lot unless you increase the brightness to the maximum. However, when the smartphones aren’t in direct sunlight, you’ll have no problem reading any content, provided that you increase the screen brightness.. Of course, among the additional options available by default on the P8 Lite (2017), you’ll find the eye protection mode which is useful if you want to use the smartphone when there is little light (perfect for reading before bed). On this device, in the display settings, there’s also an option that allows you to improve readability in sunlight, but it doesn’t change much.. The software on the P8 Lite (2017) benefits from being several months newer. The P9 Lite, launched during MWC 2016, runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, whereas the device that arrived on the European market at the start of 2017 runs. on Android 7.0 Nougat by default.. In terms of performance, not much has changed but, in the long term, the most recent Kirin 655 can do even more. The big difference, as I said, is the adaptation of the operating system for different interfaces: the P9 Lite was launched with EMUI 4.1, then upgraded to Android Nougat 7.0, whereas the P8 Lite 2017 already has version 5.0, the same interface as the Huawei Mate 9 , with all the advantages that Nougat brings along.. Under the hood of these devices, you’ll find two Huawei house processors: the HiSilicon Kirin 655 on the P8 Lite (2017) and the Kirin 650 on the P9 Lite. On the first device, there’s an octa-core chip with 2.1 GHz quad-cores and four others at 1.7 GHz. On the second device, quad-cores running up to 2.0 GHz and four others at 1.7 GHz. Both devices have a Mali T830 GPU chip with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal memory via microSD (up to 256GB).. In this regard, the winner is obvious: the youngest is also the strongest.. The only difference between the two models here is the main camera. The lens integrated in the P9 Lite has an LED flash, a f/2.0 aperture and 13 MP, compared to 12 MP on the P8 Lite (2017).. However, even though both devices appear to be identical on paper, in reality, the photographic results aren’t the same. Depending on the situation, they show different details. In order to get an expert opinion, I asked my colleague Stefan Möllenhoff what he thought:. For photos of the countryside/towns, the P8 Lite is better because it highlights. Even with selfies, the P8 Lite (2017) is better because the exposure concentrates mainly on the subject instead of the background. For wide shot photos with the main camera, I prefer images taken with the P9 Lite because they capture even more detail, but the difference between these two smartphones is minimal.. Regarding selfies, the P8 Lite 2017’s camera software certainly helps. The Beauty mode is better, in the sense that it masks flaws better than the P9 Lite, but without exaggerating as was the case on the previous P8 Lite. You can establish a level of Beauty from 0 to 10 on both devices but, once again, the feature on the P8 Lite 2017 works better. Alternatively, you can find the same features in the settings.. To get a better idea of the performance of. these two smartphones, take a look at these photos taken with the devices:. 147.2 x 72.94 x 7.6 mm. 146.8 x 72.6 x 7.5 mm. 1920 x 1080 pixels (424 ppi). 1920 x 1080 pixels (424 ppi). HSPA, LTE, NFC, Dual-SIM , Bluetooth 4.1. Under the hood of both these devices, you’ll find a 3,000 mAh non-removable battery to power the 5.2-inch screens and Full HD IPS technology. Battery life and battery performance has never been a problem for Huawei. The devices didn’t disappoint us during our reviews: they both lasted a full day (using calls, videos, internet, WhatsApp, etc.).. During the benchmarks carried out with the P8 Lite 2017, it lasted 4 hours and 53 minutes with the WiFi and brightness set to the maximum. The P9 Lite, with the same settings, lasted 4 hours and 35 minutes. Unfortunately, the devices don’t have the quick charge capability that can charge devices in around two hours.. If you’re a little short on battery, you can always resort to the options in the Battery section in Settings. The P8 Lite 2017, as well as having an energy saving mode, also offers the Ultra option which allows you to activate the use of only certain applications or certain display features. On the P9, you can choose between the Performance mode (recommended for gamers), Intelligent mode (for daily use) and the Ultra option (for when you need to save battery).. I have to be honest, I was a bit biased when I set out to write this article. I had already compared both phones to each other for another article, and although they're similar, the P9 Lite had left a better impression on me. But, looking at them more closely, I see that they're more similar than I had realized - especially now that the P9 Lite has been upgraded to Nougat. It's a close call with the camera quality as well, since a keen eye can tell that. the P9 Lite was capable of getting better shots sometimes.. The P9 Lite is just a step. the P8 Lite 2017 has a more attractive look, more up to date software (which will be updated again in the future), the battery performance is slightly better, as is the photo quality, and the screen is brighter. And, last but not least, it is even slightly cheaper!. Which would you choose? Tell us in the comments!.

This might be a bit confusing, but Huawei apparently discovered a new marketing strategy.. As we recall, Huawei officially introduced the P8 lite on January, along with the announcement that it will be available in selected European markets, for EUR 239. After so, the device adapted the name 'Honor 8 lite' in market shelves along the coasts of the Baltic sea, then it went through another change of names, the device is now known as 'nova lite' in Japan.. But it is known as P9 lite in Turkey, as it recently made an appearance in MediaMarkt, a Turkish website. Seems like Huawei's new marketing strategy involves the global market overflowing with one device, and it's many names.. Seeing as the device differs in name, the price also underwent considerable changes, depending on the country. The device is currently listed for TRY1,399 which relates to USD 380 or EUR 360. This is quite a bit of increase when compared to the first price we mentioned above, confusing right?. Unfortunately, we are lost, and cannot offer a proper explanation, since Huawei has not cleared the air yet. We have no idea what the company aims to accomplish with this unusual strategy, but we surely are curious enough to know what the 'secret' plan is. So, if this is Huawei's way of crying out for attention, we are all ears!. Meanwhile, let us know wat you think of the P8 lite or P9 lite (or whatever it is called in your country)?
