CNET también está disponible en español.. ​Lenovo Phab2 Pro: World's first Google Tango phone could be the key to mind-blowing indoor maps. The Lenovo Phab2 Pro has baked-in depth-sensing 3D cameras and arrives later this year. But what can it do? We took a look at some of its first apps.. by June 9, 2016 11:24 AM PDT. The Lenovo Phab2 Pro scans the world around you with a 3D depth-sensing camera (pictures). The Lenovo Phab2 Pro makes your current reality a bit.... Smart cameras are the future (probably). The Tango phone is called the Lenovo Phab2 Pro Specs 6.4-inch Quad HD (2560x1440) IPS display 4GB RAM 64GB storage microSD up to 128GB 4,050mAh battery with fast charging Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor Dual SIM slots (or 1 SIM, 1 microSD) Rear 16MP fast-focus camera with Tango depth sensor and motion tracking Front 8MP fixed-focus camera, F2.2 aperture Triple-array active noise cancellation Dolby Atmos + Dolby Audio Capture 5.1 0.57 lb (259g), 180 x 89 x 10.7mm Aluminum alloy construction with 2.5D curved glass LTE Bands 2/4/5/7/12/17/20/30 in North America, compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile. I'm walking around the conference room, aiming my Tango phone at the space between two chairs where Lenovo executives are sitting. A third empty chair, a plush leather one, sits on the carpet. I'm walking around it, seeing how it looks. But it isn't real: it's augmented, generated by an app on my phone screen. As I move around, it stays in place convincingly. I think to myself...I could use this to furniture-shop for my living room without even lifting a finger.. ​Motorola's new Moto Z ditches the headphone jack. Lenovo's concept flexible phone flips between handset and smartwatch. If you haven't used Google's Project Tango, or don't even know what it is, let me simplify: it's a depth-sensing 3D camera system that can scan the world around you and help place virtual objects in the real world. It might be the future of where smart cameras are headed. And it could be a sign of how phones might evolve further into world-scanning powerhouses.. Google's been developing Tango for years as a way to measure distances in 3D space, map out indoor areas, and create virtual and augmented reality, floating virtual objects into real space. Now, Lenovo's got the world's first ready-to-buy Tango phone, and it's calling it the Lenovo Phab2 Pro. And it'll be available this September.. Update, November 1: After an short additional delay, The Phab 2 Pro is now on sale.. CNET's seen Tango in action many times, doing all sorts of funky things: simulating furniture shopping , navigating museums , diving in giant VR aquariums. Tango has been in a developer-kit tablet for a while, where it was used for lots of experimental ideas. Tango's chief skills are depth-sensing, location-mapping, and placing virtual objects into reality with a better sense of accuracy. On the tablet, most apps were used in landscape mode. On the Phab2 Pro, most Tango apps are still landscape-mode oriented, too.. The Lenovo Phab2 Pro scans the world around you with a 3D depth-sensing camera (pictures). The apps I got to try were varied. One placed virtual furniture in the room I was in, allowing me to experiment with what would fit in real, physical space. Lowe's is making one of the first potential Tango killer apps with Lowe's Vision, which measures living space and then can layer in additions, furniture and decor to model in the space. Think Microsoft HoloLens , but instead of floating in front of your face you're viewing things on your phone screen. The rear trio of Tango-enabled cameras have an infrared depth-sensing, a wide-angle lens, and can track motion.. There was another app where I was able to walk around the room I was in, while the Tango camera started generating a 3D photo-mapped model of where I was. This is Tango's most amazing feature: with a bunch of these, you could walk around and map out interior spaces in full 3D. Tango's also unique because it can not only measure, but learn about the shape of areas: where objects begin and end, and where walls and doorways are. At Google I/O , Google said it's aiming to use this tech to map out interior places with the accuracy of outdoor maps. Maybe it's to beef up Google Maps' worldwide database. As an everyday person, however, I'm not still not sure how this would help anyone.. That's the biggest challenge with Tango: it still feels like tech seeking a killer app or purpose. But it definitely has a bunch of clever tricks up its sleeve.. There are a few games, too. I tried running around and shooting at virtual alien-things that hopped around the room I was actually in -- the conference table, the chairs -- much like some augmented reality phone games have already allowed for years. On Tango, the position tracking is far more accurate. It still feels a little silly. More impressively, I laid virtual dominoes on the nearby table and watched them knock down one by one. I walked around my domino creation, and it mostly stayed put -- with a bit of drift that Lenovo says will be corrected by launch. I looked a 3D velociraptor model standing in the corner of the conference room.. Lenovo promises 22 Tango-ready apps for launch this year, and estimates up to 100 apps by the end of 2017. Tango still feels like a development project, in a lot of ways.. Tango isn't the only type of smart camera tech lurking around: Intel's 3D RealSense cameras have been around for years, and can also track depth. They're making their way into other devices including helmets. Microsoft's developed similar positional-tracking tech in the Kinect and in the HoloLens. Amazon tried something similar in spirit with the Fire Phone and its array of cameras. And Apple acquired Primesense , the company that created the Kinect, back in 2013.. There have been many attempts at similar tech. Smarter cameras equipped with more advanced computer vision processing and deep learning could be the magic equation. Face and object recognition, auto navigation, and advanced mixed-reality applications that fuse the virtual and real. If phones get upgraded, smarter cameras, they could be doorways into a new future.. Lenovo's new Phab2 phone line comes in three models, all of them with massive 6.4-inch screens. The one with Google's new magic Tango cameras -- the Phab2 Pro -- costs more ($499 unlocked in the US, equivalent to £345 UK or AU$672), and has an extra camera array on the back, arranged down the middle. There's a wide-angle camera, plus infrared depth sensing and motion tracking.. The Phab2 Pro has a Quad HD-resolution display, 4GB of RAM, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor that's specifically built for Tango. The phone's large size means it feels more like a tablet than a phone. But it's smaller than the previous developer-edition Tango tablet, and more affordable. For those reasons alone, it'll likely be the new Tango device of choice. Whether it becomes more depends on apps.. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro (gunmetal gray). Lenovo Phab 2 Pro (champagne gold).

Smartphones Everything About Lenovo Phab2 Pro. Google made an official announcement of its virtual reality platform, Daydream. Thanks to that Google’s Project Tango has quite become an echo about to fade. What’s more exciting? Something came up to the surface – the Lenovo Phab2 Pro .. Lenovo seemingly found Google’s Tango as too brilliant a project to let it fritter away. So, Lenovo worked on a slightly-similar concept and showcased another wonder in the world of technology. Now, Lenovo’s newest Phab2 Pro is not only the first ever Lenovo-branded phone to be sold and purchased in the US, but is also the first Project Tango Smartphone in the world.. Breaking such immense ground in the world of tech, Lenovo Phab2 Pro continues to receive positive acclaims. However, as any other innovation, it also receives critical reviews from critics. This revolving scenario gets people wondering, “Just how worthy is Lenovo Phab2 Pro of the label as the world’s first Project Tango Smartphone?” Let’s see.. Phab2 Pro measures 7.1 inches (180 mm) by height, 3.5 inches (89 mm) by width, and 0.42 inches (10.7 mm) by depth. It weighs 9.1 ounces (258 g). Compared to Samsung Galaxy S6 or to Sony Xperia T2 , this size is enormous. It might even be hard to be held one-handedly.. Lenovo Phab2 Pro comes in Gunmetal Grey or Champagne Gold aluminum body with a smooth surface. The front is designed in 2.5D curved glass. It is dominated by a 6.4-inch in-Plane Switch display with a 2,560 x 1,440 graphic display resolution that allows good viewing angles. The back is made of metal with the camera sensor, depth sensor, motion-tracking sensor, fish-eye camera, and the fingerprint sensor. At the near bottom are the icon of Project Tango and the branding icon of Lenovo. A metal frame is designed at the side, in between the front and back.. Project Tango has been making a lot of noise on and out of the internet for quite a while now, but not all has entirely grasped the concept. Project Tango is a platform that creates augmented reality (AR) experiences through 3D mapping. It uses software from Google and a set of sensors to sense and map surroundings. With Project Tango, devices like Lenovo Phab2 Pro can sense space and motion, track depth, and visualize surrounding objects.. To sense motion and identify the 3D space, Lenovo Phab2 Pro uses a wide-viewing fish-eye camera in conjunction with a regular camera sensor. This positional tracking allows the use of AR for different purposes.. Lenovo is demonstrating the Project Tango with several different apps such as virtual realistic shooting games that emphasizes the abilities of Project Tango. Lenovo also features an educational app made in collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), and a domino app with a Rube Goldberg-style contraption set up with virtual pieces. These applications prove just how the new technology can do. Prior demos of Project Tango have also shown how the technology can function in a wide range of purposes such as in navigating round indoor space or in presenting contextual information.. Lenovo announces that there will be more or less 25 applications of different categories from games to utility apps to location-based apps and so on. By the end of the year, accordingly, there will be 100 apps available in the device’s special app store.. Lenovo Phab2 Pro features a Snapdragon 652 processor from Qualcomm , which has eight cores: four Cortex-A72 and four Cortex-A53, running at 1.8 GHz, and an Adreno 510 GPU. Some critics concern this power is not enough for Tango, but Lenovo claims it is heavily customized. This power is accordingly enough for the first generation of Google Tango products.. The product has 64GB of internal storage and 4GB of RAM. Its micro SD card slot is capable of handling up to 128GB.. With its enormous size, Phab2 Pro is matched with a large 4,050mAh battery. Its charging capabilities are seemingly high, too. According to Lenovo, its talk time is 18 hours and its standby time is over 13 days.. Phab2 Pro will support GSM, UMTS, and LTE bands and will, thus, work on GSM carriers. Since the device supports band 12 and 17, the customers of T-Mobile and AT&T can expect better range and penetration of building. Additionally, Phab2 Pro supports Bluetooth 4.0 and dual-band Wi-Fi.. Although the Pro has a huge focus on Tango, it still has a regular 8-megapixel front-facing camera and 16-megapixel rear-facing camera, which is capable of saving 4K video. It features Dolby Atmos surround sound and Dolby Audio Capture 5.1 that allows 5.1-channel recording surround sound.. Phab2 Pro runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with the custom UI changes of Lenovo. This software can alter app icons, change lock screen, and add features. The Pro also has software that can pre-install Netflix, SwiftKey, and McAfee.. Lenovo Phab2 Pro is now available in the worldwide market. It is only sold in Best Buy and selected Lowe’s stores, but it will be made available online by the end of this year. In the US, the Pro will start at the cost of $499. With the illustrious label of the world’s first Project Tango Smartphone , the price is reasonable enough, especially for phablet enthusiasts.. Aside from the fact that it is the world’s first Project Tango Smartphone, Lenovo Phab2 Pro is significant in the world of technology because it will serve as the early pioneering example of the development of Tango and any other kinds of technology in the future.. The world has many reasons to try and purchase this new innovation, but as said, as with any other new technology invention, there will be reservations. Nevertheless, Lenovo Phab2 Pro holds firmly its ace card – the Project Tango.. Tango displays a whole new world—a world where mobile computing is immersive. In the world Tango displays, people can shift from the real world to the virtual world and vice versa. Through the course of the coming years in the future, Tango will launch its full capabilities. For now, the tech world has the Lenovo Phab2 Pro – a revolutionary mark in the age of mobile computing.. TAGS lenovo News phab2 phab2 pro. Buying a Memory Card – What You Need to Know.

Extra cameras and sensors let the device 'see' its surroundings in a whole new way.. The second generation of Lenovo's Phab phones are here already, headlined by the first-ever Project Tango -equipped smartphone with sensors and cameras that can map its surroundings. The Phab2 Pro (check out our hands-on impressions right here ) is special because it fulfills the promise of demos that Google's Advanced Technologies and Products ( ATAP ) division has been showing us for a few years. The phone's dual cameras create an "eye" that sees its surroundings in 3D with depth perception, while additional sensors monitor location and nearby objects 250,000 times per second.. Gallery: Lenovo Phab2 Pro | 6 Photos. Google and Lenovo have shown off experiences that use the Tango technology to provide augmented reality-guided tours in museums and odd experiences like Woorld , but there are more-practical applications. For example, Lowe's has an app that it says will allow homeowners to remodel by virtually envisioning how appliances or furniture will look in their space. Lenovo VP Jeff Meredith envisions the technology becoming "pervasive, just like GPS.". Despite shrinking from 7 inches to a 6.4-inch size usable by human hands and coming with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, each Phab2 packs a large 4,050mAh battery, along with Dolby Atmos audio features, including the ability to record in 5.1 surround sound. The Pro elevates things to the stratosphere with premium specs and sensing abilities that trump any phone we've seen before -- all with a price of $500, unlocked.. The Pro also adds on a specially designed eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, 64GB of built-in storage (expandable via microSD), 4GB of RAM and a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel "assertive" display. All of these phones are scheduled to arrive globally in September, while the Tango-enabled Phab2 Pro will be sold at Lowe's and Best Buy stores and online by the end of the year..

Google's Project Tango technology, which brings augmented reality to a Lenovo smartphone.. At the Lenovo Tech World event taking place today in San Francisco, the Chinese tech giant let attendees see the first Tango-based handset that consumers will be able to buy:. the comparatively mammoth-sized Lenovo PHAB2 Pro smartphone that is coming out in September.. Lenovo has been working with Google for about a year on Tango, which has elements of. has been selling a $512 Tango development kit tablet to phone manufacturers, and. Lenovo claims a six-month headstart over rivals.. makes this $499 phablet device particularly newsworthy, but the PHAB2 Pro, along with two less expensive. are also the first smartphones in the U.S. Separately, Lenovo-owned Motorola continues to launch Moto-branded phones in this country, including a couple of new modular flagship Droids that were also introduced at Tech World.. Moto phones let you snap on speaker, projectors, power. The Tech World event is a showcase for the Chinese company that most tech watchers in this country first paid attention to 11 years ago when it bought IBM’s PC business and the well-known ThinkPad line of laptops. Today, Lenovo ships more PCs globally than any other company and also sells phones in overseas markets.. The PHAB2 Pro will be sold here at Lenovo.com, in Best Buy, and in select Lowes stores.. The PHAB2 Pro will be available in two colors. The Lowes connection is interesting because the retailer is one of the first to exploit Tango’s capabilities as a device that senses physical motion and contextually maps out the space around it. Lowes will be bringing out a Tango-enabled app called Lowes Vision that promises to let you use the phone to visualize how appliances, a backsplash or other household items will look in the room you would envision putting them in.. This is accomplished through a trio of core technologies: motion tracking, depth perception and area learning, which as Google explains, lets Tango devices see and remember the key visual features of a physical space—the edges, corners, and other unique features—so that it can recognize the area again later.. The phone has a fast-focus 16- megapixel rear camera, and various motion and depth sensors. Such sensors can capture more than 250,000 measurements a second, Lenovo says. It also has three microphones and relies on audio technology from Dolby. Inside is a Quad-Core Qualcomm processor that has been optimized for Tango.. Lenovo's PHAB2 Pro sports a massive 6.4-inch screen. From left: Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge, Apple's iPhone 6 Plus and Lenovo's PHAB2 Pro. Tradeoff: This is one mother of a device size-wise which immediately becomes apparent when you place it as I did next to an iPhone 6 Plus and. At 0.57 pound, you feel the. I didn’t get to check out the Lowes app during a preview, but I did get a glimpse of other augmented reality-like experiences. Peering through the Quad HD 6.4-inch PHAB2 Pro display, I got to walk around virtual dinosaurs—the technology overlays such virtual objects and characters on top of your real life physical environment.. I did this without having to put on any headgear, as is the case with other augmented or virtual reality devices that are out now or coming soon. That said, the software I got to try out briefly was. by no means a finished product. For example, I got to see how you can line up virtual dominos on a physical table.. And I got to shoot at menacing robots that inhabited the meeting room I was in.. Other potential use cases for Tango include indoor navigation--helping you, say, find your way inside a subway stop, casino, or hotel.. Lenovo expects about 25 Tango apps to be available at launch and about 100 by year end.. For all its promise and potential, I wouldn’t expect this first device go mainstream. be intrigued and I can only imagine. specialized business use cases where it may make. — Allana Akhtar (@allanaakh) June 9, 2016.

NEWS l l. EVENTS l l. RESEARCH l l. Hands-on with Lenovo’s Phab2 Pro, Phab2 Plus, Moto Z, and Moto Z Force. Jordan Novet @jordannovet June 9, 2016 6:11 PM. Above: The Lenovo Phab2 Pro using a Google Tango app.. The real cost of mining Ethereum. Walmart’s problem isn’t Amazon — it’s a lack of interest in who its customers are. Microsoft releases new Windows 10 preview with more proactive Windows Update. I can independently confirm that an augmented-reality smartphone is really cool.. While holding the new Lenovo Phab2 Pro in my hand, I placed a virtual stool on a real table a foot or two in front of me, got up close and stepped back and looked at it from a few different angles. And that’s when I realized that Google’s underlying Tango AR system adds a whole new dimension to mobile devices. Above: A Google Tango app on the Lenovo Phab2 Pro.. And there’s a good amount of room to see everything trippy that’s made possible with multiple cameras and a specially tuned processor. It also looks damn good and performs admirably for regular mobile computing tasks — like web browsing — against a nearly stock Android Marshmallow backdrop. The display is bright and colorful (and not full of noticeable pixels).. The expansiveness of the display has a downside. At 6.4 inches diagonally, this is a sizeable handset. And it’s also not light, at more than half a pound. What you end up with is something that’s not very comfortable to hold in one hand for an extended period of time. I found myself switching hands again and again.. That’s not abnormal for a phablet. But it doesn’t feel just right. At its current size it’s unwieldy, and I repeatedly found myself hitting the home button and hurtling myself out of Tango apps by accident. That’s too bad for a device that’s meant to showcase a new technology.. Above: The Lenovo Phab2 Pro from the side.. Jeff Meredith, vice president and general manager of Lenovo’s mobile business group, assured me that future Tango-ready devices from his company will be both bigger and smaller than this one. Personally I’ll be keen to try the smaller ones, even if that means I’ll have a narrower field of view and will have to move the phone around more to get a good sense of the AR scene in front of me.. Lenovo’s other two new Phab2 phones, including the dual-camera Phab2 Plus, also have AR capability — through something called LenovoAR. Open the camera app of the Phab2 Plus and select the AR option, and you’ll see a few odd buttons. One has a fish on it. Push the button, and as you look at the display representing what’s in front of the phone (using the rear camera), you’ll see things zooming by in a blur. What are they? Fish, of course. It’s AR, yes, but it’s not going to run Tango apps. And I doubt it will be enough of an attraction to make people buy it.. The dual cameras — accessible only through the Dual Camera mode of the camera app, because they apparently are not on by default — are also not astounding. The Huawei P9, which is also armed with dual cameras, produced clearer, more detailed images, with or without zoom, in my testing over the past few weeks.. The camera app on the Phab2 Plus has a night mode that compensates for poor lighting, and while that could come in handy in certain situations, I found that it made certain parts of some test photos too bright. There are ways to edit out parts of images and put them on top of exotic backgrounds. And on top of that, it’s just as big as the Phab2 Pro. Altogether, then, the Phab2 Plus didn’t seem to be the impressive bargain phone I’d hoped it would be. Although it may be a good answer to the Nexus 5X from LG.. Things get more interesting with the new Moto Z phones .. The thinner of the two is the Moto Z. It’s considerably thinner than the appropriately named Phab2 phones. And, in contrast to the Moto X and the more recent Moto X Pure Edition , it’s nice and straight on the back. There’s a camera bump that Lenovo made no attempt to hide by smoothing it out.. And on the bottom of the back, you’ll find 15 golden dots that are reminiscent of the Smart Connector on Apple’s iPad Pros. These dots are the way the Moto Z communicates with the new Moto Mods — like a charger and a speaker. The mods, or just coverings, in case you don’t like the raw unprotected back, snap on and off magnetically. They’re fun and, most importantly, easy to use.. Above: Lenovo’s Moto Z, and an attachable backing on the right.. The camera app is the classic one from Motorola phones — just tap anywhere onscreen to shoot, by default. Photos made with the 13-megapixel rear camera were not the most impressive. But there is a fingerprint scanner on the front of the device below the display, and that’s a wonderful and welcome addition.. The Moto Z Force has a fingerprint scanner and mod support just like the Moto Z. But the screen is shatter-proof, wow! And the rear camera is a 21-megapixel shooter.. Above: The Moto Z Force with a case on it.. It’s thicker and a bit heavier than the Moto Z, but the camera’s performance is clearly better.. But the display does not look quite as spectacular as the Phab2 Pro, I must say. Colors just don’t pop as much.. Above: The front of the Lenovo Moto Z Force.. Still, of all the phones Motorola announced today, I imagine that this one will turn out to be the most popular — although if Lenovo decides to stick a high pricetag on it, that hunch could prove to be wrong.. We’ll get a better sense of all these things once we receive review units..

Manufacturer description: The Lenovo Phab2 Pro is the first Google Project Tango enabled device. It provides an Augmented Reality (AR) experience, thanks to its ability to sense 3D-motion and geometry. It can capture 3D-scans of its surroundings and use the data to create 3D-maps, recognize places or track objects. The technology can project virtual effects in real-world spaces, help navigate indoor areas or provide information about objects it has recognized.. To achieve this the Phab2 Pro has a total of four cameras. In addition to the 8MP front module and the 16MP rear camera there are a depth and a motion tracking camera, both also located on the back. Underneath the 6.4" Quad-HD IPS display there is a Qualcomm's Snapdragon 652 chipset running Android 6.0. 4GB RAM and 64GB of microSD-expandable storage are on board as well, along with a fingerprint reader and Dolby Atmos surround sound technology. Energy is provided by a 4,050 mAh battery. All the high-end technology is nicely wrapped up in metal unibody that is available in gold or silver..

The Phab2 Plus packs dual cameras, while the plain Phab2 offers a big screen and AR for a very low price.. The centerpiece of Lenovo's self-branded US phones may be the higher-end, Tango -packing Phab2 Pro , but that doesn't mean there isn't something available for the budget crowd. Lenovo is unveiling two lower-cost models, the Phab2 and Phab2 Plus, that deliver some of the experience for a much lower price. Both pack gigantic 6.4-inch screens (the same size as the Pro) and 13-megapixel rear cameras that deliver augmented reality "special effects" such as virtual backgrounds -- while they won't make you forget that Tango exists, you won't have to give up AR entirely. They also share immersive Dolby Atmos audio and a whopping 4,050mAh battery that can last for over two weeks on standby.. Gallery: Lenovo Phab2 and Phab2 Plus | 13 Photos. After that, though, they couldn't be more different. The base Phab2 carries a low-res 720p display, a modest quad-core MediaTek processor and 16GB of expandable storage. Jump to the Plus and you not only get a 1080p curved glass screen, an eight-core MediaTek chip, 32GB of space and a fingerprint reader, but also a dual rear camera array that promises better low-light shots, more detail in the shadows and after-the-shot refocusing.. The big deal for both phones may simply be the price. Both will be available worldwide in September, with prices starting at $199 for the Phab2 and $299 for the Phab2 Plus. These could be solid bargains if you want a huge display without spending an equally huge amount of cash..

Gives you a taste of Augmented Reality, but not much more. We are part of The Trust Project. We all want our smartphones filled with groundbreaking tech - but that can either be the kind that's perfect for everyday use, or something that isn't quite as useful,. but demonstrates plenty of potential to bridge a technological gap in our lives.. Lenovo's Phab2 Pro falls into the latter category. It's the world's first smartphone with Project Tango, Google's foray into Augmented Reality (AR).. Haven't we seen this all before? Well, yes and no. It sounds a lot like the setup you'll find in. Intel RealSense camera setup, and could do clever stuff like measuring objects just by pointing the lens at them.. Lenovo's version fits in your pocket, but is the Phab2 Pro just as gimmicky - or does it do enough to make us rethink how we use AR?. For such cutting edge tech, the Phab2 Pro is a surprisingly affordable US$499. Just keep in mind that it only has the guts of a mid-range phone, though.. There's a Snapdragon 652 CPU running the show, paired with 4GB of RAM. It's an octa-core chip, but clock speeds aren't the highest - which begs the question: is the Phab2 Pro underpowered?. With modest Geekbench scores of 1474 (single-core) and 3540 (multi-core), it gets the job done on paper. In real world use too, the phone is zippy enough to get you through your daily routine without any noticeable lag or slowdown.. Loading up a Tango-enabled app does, however, feel a little on the slow side. The experience is generally fine once you're using it though, so we're not too worried. 3D models are rendered quickly enough and it doesn't feel too sluggish, albeit barely – but more on that later.. On first impressions at least, it doesn't give me the confidence that the next generation of apps will run smoothly on it.. You get 64GB of on-board storage, and there's a microSD card slot too, so you won't run out of space in a hurry. Like most other phones, though, the slot also accommodates a second SIM card, meaning that it's shared. Performance aside, the Phab2 Pro otherwise feels like a premium phone. There's nary a flaw on its body, and they took the effort to chamfer and polish the edges perfectly, even on the USB port – now that's premium-level effort for you.. The 6.4in, 2560x1440 display certainly adds to the upmarket feel, and it's a real visual treat. Lenovo has picked an LCD panel, so while contrast and black levels won't rival OLED screens from Samsung, it still looks sharp and has great viewing angles.. Dolby Atmos is along for the ride, too, tweaking the sound EQ and letting you record multi-channel audio using the built-in microphones. The external speaker is loud and clear as well.. However, the ergonomics, size and weight aren't quite singing the same song.. Nothing can disguise the fact that this is a rather bulky and heavy phone - I couldn't change volume and then use the fingerprint sensor without changing my grip first. You just can't reach it all, and it slides off non-flat surfaces easily when you put it down.. It would be tricky to make the phone any slimmer though, seeing as it's packed with cameras and sensors.. You get an RGB camera, a time-of-flight camera, a motion-tracking camera, and an IR depth sensor, in addition to the usual array of motion sensors to make Tango possible.. The large, 4050mAh battery probably didn't help, either - but it does let you go for well over a day between charges. Stay away from power-intensive apps, and the Tango AR modes, and you'll be waking up on day three with a small amount of juice left.. If I'm honest, I wasn't expecting much from the Phab2 Pro's main camera. A 16MP sensor and phase detection autofocus should do a respectable job, so with those expectations in mind, I wasn't disappointed.. You get decent enough results in daylight, but things aren't so great at night.. However, you should note that it struggles to focus when lighting conditions aren't optimal, so you have to be selective about your subject matter and composition. You'll have a better time if you choose a clear focal point, or compose the picture so that it's not difficult for the autofocus to figure out what you want to do.. Image quality is decent enough, provided you have the right amount of light.. In low light, the algorithm is rather heavy-handed; while the images aren't grainy at all, it does come at the cost of detail.. Despite the camera-heavy nature of the Phab2 Pro, it seems that the photography element wasn't quite high on the agenda. Its focus speed of 0.3 seconds was touted as a feature, but in practice, it felt no faster than most cameras.. If there's any reason to get this phone, it has got to be Tango.. At the time of writing, 25 free Tango-enabled apps are available, along with eight paid-for ones. They run the gamut of genres, from racing games, first-person experiential apps, and amusing ones like Holo , where you simply place modelled characters into your environment .. In all honesty, not all apps are useful, although they do show the sheer potential of what is to come. The ones that best help you appreciate the benefits of AR are the simple ones like Measure , a virtual tape measure that can give a relatively decent approximation through the cameras. Apps like Lowe's Vision and iStaging. you virtually place furniture around your house before you buy (if you live in the US, anyway) so you can have an idea of whether they'll fit, or suit the decor.. Tango needs more apps like Matterport Scenes. It's easily the most futuristic of the apps available at the moment, with its ability to scan an entire room and all its items and save it as a 3D model that you can use for measurements. What's killer is that it's so easy to use: no elaborate techniques are needed, and the app gives easy steps to follow if you miss out something during your scan. However, this is also very taxing on the phone.. Remember when we mentioned earlier that the hardware was okay for the most part? Well, this is one instance where you can see it struggling, as the scanning slows to a crawl and the frame rates drop. The fact that it's struggling for an app that can justify Tango's relevance isn't very encouraging. Not to mention that the battery drains a fair bit quicker as well.. Games are undoubtedly part of the charm, although, in this case, aren't as compelling as they should be, yet. You'll certainly have some fun moments creating over-the-top race tracks in. as you challenge the limits of your creativity, designing a race track that zig-zags around your furnishings, but it's an idea that's sexier than the execution.. are a little more successful at assimilating your surroundings into the gameplay action, largely thanks to a more polished game mechanic, but ultimately the idea of AR applications (and games) hinges on how important it is to you to bring your surroundings into play, so to speak.. It's the apps, more so than the hardware, which will determine if a platform like Tango grows and succeeds. Perhaps it's good that Lenovo made the Phab2 Pro affordable, so you won't be left high and dry if the worst case scenario happens and app support simply never shows up.. So would we recommend the Phab2 Pro? Only if you love and believe in AR that much.. Apps still need work, and it's anyone's guess as to how they'll improve in the next year. If the existing hardware struggles now, it might keel over when more advanced stuff shows up - so it's a leap of faith on that account right now.. From what we've seen, you probably need more processing power and a bigger battery, or at least one that charges quickly.. If you take AR out of the equation, the Phab2 Pro loses its sheen. While the build quality and parts are on the level of a great mid-tier phone, the size and ergonomics are rather difficult to get around.. The 2K 6.4-inch display is a plus, but there's no compelling plus point outside of AR, which frankly, is still in its teething stage.. Buy the Phab 2 Pro smartphone here from Lenovo.

Lenovo Phab2 Pro review roundup: Bad hardware for an incomplete platform. Lenovo Phab2 Pro review roundup: Bad hardware for an incomplete platform. By Ryan Whitwam on December 28, 2016 at 9:30 am. This site may earn affiliate commissions from the links on this page. Google has been working on its Project Tango augmented reality platform since at least 2014, but that’s just when it was unveiled. A lot of work has gone into improving the way phones analyze their environments, but does that translate well into consumer products? In the case of the first official Tango phone, that’s a big, fat “no.” The Lenovo Phab2 Pro is available unlocked for $500, but the reviews have not been kind.. The reviews have called out three main issues with the Phab2 Pro, the most obvious of which is that this phone is huge. I don’t mean it’s huge like we call the V20 or Pixel XL “huge.” This phone is almost a tablet. In fact, there are Amazon tablets that are smaller. The Phab2 Pro has a 6.4-inch screen and beefy aluminum frame. Usually I’d praise the use of an aluminum unibody design, but in this case it makes the phone incredibly heavy. Ars Technica points out it weighs more than half a pound .. As a consequence of being gigantic, the Phab2 Pro’s ergonomics are off. The buttons are difficult to reach, and the fingerprint sensor is much lower on the back than it should be. One of the Tango sensor windows is where you’d expect the fingerprint sensor to be, so you smudge up with your finger constantly .. Speaking of the Tango sensors, the Phab2 Pro’s modest hardware doesn’t seem to be up to the task of using them. The hardware performance is issue number two. Tango includes a depth sensor, IR projector, and a motion tracker. Combined with the phone’s internal gyroscope and accelerometer, it knows where in the world it is and how its position relates to other objects. You can use this to measure things, place virtual objects in the real world, and so on. The Phab2 Pro just gets very laggy when you’re doing it.. This phone has a Snapdragon 652 SoC, which is a mid-range chip. Lenovo says the software has been tuned to pipe all the Tango data through efficiently, but that was not my experience, nor were other reviewers impressed. It can’t keep up with phones running Snapdragon 820 and 821 chips. Even some older devices best it. The Phab2 Pro has a big 4050mAh battery, but the phone runs for barely over an hour while utilizing the Tango sensors.. The performance issues in Tango apps are obvious, especially the Matterport Scanner, which is probably the most effective demonstration of Tango. It lets you make 3D scans of objects and room. It’s just very slow and buggy. Many of the other apps and games feel like tech demos, and the selection is poor. This is the third major issue cited in Phab2 Pro reviews. All the games are one-trick ponies and the apps are just sluggish and buggy enough to be frustrating to use, even if you have a use for them. By and large, developers aren’t interested in making apps for a platform that almost no one uses. There are no killer apps for Tango, and I don’t know that there will be one any time soon without more developer interest.. Google isn’t giving up on Tango because of one bad phone. There will be more, and the hardware will improve. We’re just going to need a better Tango phone before we’ll know whether or not augmented reality is living up to the hype..

Lenovo Phab2 Pro review: A phone-like object wrapped around Project Tango. 2016/11/28 11:12am PST Nov 28, 2016. Google Lenovo Phab2 Pro Phone Reviews Project Tango Reviews. 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design and display 5 Performance and battery 6 Camera 7 Software and Tango 8 Conclusion. The Lenovo Phab2 Pro is not the first device to have Google's Tango augmented reality platform, but it's the first one to be aimed at consumers. It's also the first Lenovo-branded smartphone to launch in the US. With the Phab2 Pro, you can see virtual items overlaid in the real world, or explore virtual worlds by moving around in the real one. But let's not forget, this is a phone too.. People will presumably buy this product to carry around with them on a daily basis, but it's only available as a $500 unlocked device.. So, it's up to Lenovo to make a good pitch to. US phone buyers who have more choices than ever before. Although, I think the company might have taken the cliché. "go big or go home" a bit too literally.. Lenovo Phab2 Pro is a gigantic phone—that's the first thing you notice picking it up, and it ends up being the defining feature. Phab2 Pro, you first have to cope with the size. Even if you think you're fine with the size of this phone, the reality is much different. take a backseat to Tango, and the result is a phone that feels like yet another tech demo.. 16MP rear, 8MP front, Tango motion detection and position sensors. Dual SIM with LTE bands 2, 4, 5, 7, 12, 17, 20, 30. 179.8 x 88.6 x 10.7 mm, 259g. A very solid device made from aluminum. As long as you don't use Tango too much, the Phab2 Pro gets great battery life. Lenovo managed to avoid burying Android under layers of junk like it normally does.. The Phab2 Pro is gigantic and heavy. It's not comfortable to hold, and it won't even fit in my pockets. It's like a little tablet that makes phone calls. The lag isn't too frequent, but I feel like the Phab2 Pro doesn't have a lot of headroom if it slows down as it ages. It's too low on the back of the phone. I touched the Tango camera module almost every time I went for the sensor. There are no truly compelling experiences for Tango. It's just a novelty right now. A phone this expensive should not be using microUSB in late 2016. $500 can get you a better unlocked phone without Project Tango.. Lenovo Phab2 Pro is a big phone would be a profound understatement. I don't want to beat you over the head with this, but many of the Phab2 Pro's design aspects come back to the massive overall size. Of all the smartphones I've used, this one is by far the biggest. It has a 6.4-inch display with a width of 89mm and a mass of 259g. In fact, I'm not aware of any mainstream Android phone that is larger. Even the Samsung Galaxy Mega had a smaller 6.3-inch screen and was much lighter (199g) with a slightly narrower frame.. The Phab2 Pro's display takes up a high percentage of the surface, so at least you're not also dealing with big bezels too. The width of a device is the most important ergonomic aspect, and the Phab2 Pro is simply too wide to be used comfortably in one hand for. It's even worse if you're holding the phone out in front of you to use augmented reality apps.. Lenovo Phab2 Pro has an aluminum unibody frame with antenna lines on the back. You've probably seen phones with very similar designs, just smaller. The edge of the phone has chamfers that ease the transition to the front and back sections. The front glass panel is more of that "2.5D" glass that curves downward at the edge. The rear aluminum shell has a slight curve that would make a smaller phone more comfortable to hold. However, it makes little difference in this case.. The bottom of the phone houses the single speaker and the charging port. One unusual quirk of the Lenovo Phab2 Pro is that the port is a microUSB instead of USB Type-C. I thought we were past the point a premium phone would ship with microUSB, but I guess Lenovo didn't get the memo. I'll give Lenovo points for the exposed torx screws, though. I think they give the phone a neat industrial vibe. On the right edge are the power and volume buttons. They are clicky and easy to press, but the volume rocker rattles around quite a lot. It's the only part of the build that feels lacking in quality.. Even a quick glance at the back of the. Lenovo Phab2 Pro and you'll realize there's something different about this phone. That's where all the Tango sensors are housed. In addition to the standard camera, there's also a motion tracking module and depth-sensing camera. The regular camera is at the very top, with the other modules extending downward from that. The large module just north of the fingerprint sensor. is the motion tracking camera, which I've smudged up with my finger approximately 30,000 times. The layout of the modules on the back of the phone pushes the fingerprint sensor too low on the back leaving the motion tracking camera where you'd naturally expect the fingerprint reader to be. It's just another example of this behemoth phone's poor ergonomics.. Speaking of the fingerprint sensor, it's on-par with the sensors we've seen on recent Nexus and Pixel phones. That means (if you can find it), the Phab2 Pro's sensor is reasonably fast and very accurate. It takes longer to train than most phones I've used, but it almost never fails to read my finger.. There are no on-screen buttons on the Phab2 Pro (aside from a floating button menu feature). Instead, Lenovo has added capacitive buttons to the bottom bezel. I prefer on-screen buttons, but I'll give Lenovo a pass on this one because the icons are all correct for stock Android and the positioning low on the phone is actually helpful with the device's large size. A rare ergonomic win for the Phab2 Pro.. Size comparison with the Pixel XL.. This phone is large enough that people will definitely notice you using it in public (be prepared for a lot of awkward interactions with strangers). Even with my normal pants pocket, the Phab 2 Pro sticks out the top. Sitting down with the phone in my pocket is also rather uncomfortable. Maybe this won't bother you if you carry your phone in a bag of some sort. Just on the basis of needing to carry my phone in a pocket, the. Lenovo Phab2 Pro is not a phone I would buy.. There isn't a great deal to say about the Phab2 Pro's display, aside from noting again that it's massive. At 6.4-inches and 1440p, the image is crisp and the viewing angles are excellent. This is an LCD, meaning the. Lenovo Phab2 Pro won't ever get support for Daydream VR. I suppose you'll have to choose one form of non-standard reality—augmented or virtual. The display uses an "assertive" technology that can tweak colors and contrast on a pixel-by-pixel level. Supposedly this should improve readability in varying lighting conditions. I do have to admit that the display looks better outdoors than most LCDs I've seen lately. The colors do feel generally muted, though. The screen is fine for the price, though I'd prefer to have an AMOLED. Lenovo Phab2 Pro is powered by a Snapdragon 652, which is a rung or two lower than I'd expect for a $500 phone. I'm sure the Tango modules eat up part of the cost, though. While a Snapdragon 820 or 821 might be more desirable, Lenovo did a good enough job optimizing for the 652. The Snapdragon 652 pops up mostly in mid-range phones, but here the Phab2 Pro has been specially tuned to timestamp all the data captured by the phone's sensors. This ensures that the orientation and visual sensors remain in sync as you're using augmented reality apps and features. I'll get more to Tango performance shortly, but the device generally performs. Lenovo Phab2 Pro is not what I'd call a fast phone, but neither is it annoyingly sluggish. It clips along at a reasonable pace during use, only occasionally lagging with heavy multitasking or when opening/closing a game.. With a 4050mAh battery, I expected excellent battery life out of the. For the most part, that's what I've been getting. You'll easily get two days of moderate use with 3-4 hours of screen time. Over 6 hours with heavy usage in a single day is doable as well. That assumes little or no augmented reality usage, but that's really what the phone is all about. It goes from above average battery life to middling. The Pixel, which I've also been using a lot, gets slightly better battery life. It doesn't have to power Tango, though.. Part of the Tango hardware is the regular camera, which produces the "reality" part of augmented reality. Sadly, the pictures aren't very impressive. It's an experience you'll be familiar with if you've ever used a mid-range phone with "good" camera hardware and poor optimization.. The main camera is a 16MP sensor with phase detection autofocus. It sounds good, but the photos this camera spits out are usually throwaways. In bright light with HDR mode on, the Phab2 Pro takes acceptable photos. The HDR mode is kind of necessary to pump up the colors and keep things from looking washed out. However, HDR captures take upward of two seconds on this phone.. In anything but bright light, I'm seeing plenty of focusing issues. It can take multiple seconds to focus, by which time you could miss the shot. Even if you take a photo in medium indoor light, there will be noise. Some of these images are salvageable, but I wouldn't even bother using the Phab2's camera in low light. If you were hoping the 8MP front-facing camera would redeem the phone in some way, sorry. It has poor color reproduction and the photos are too dim.. For fans of augmented reality, there's a whole AR mode in the camera. You can have the phone add characters like a dog, fairy, or a dragon to your photos. There are a few animations each one can do, and some have "landscapes" to go with them. For example, the jungle seen above with the dragon. Although, notice how the landscape is just a single flat layer? It doesn't take into account the presence of any obstacles like my shelving unit on the left. It just seems like Lenovo didn't put a lot of thought into this.. The Phab2 Pro runs Android 6.0.1 out of the box, which strikes me as a little odd. Why is a phone that is supposed to introduce Tango to consumers running an old version of Android? I'm surprised Google let Lenovo move ahead without Nougat on this phone, but it's not like Marshmallow is unusable. Lenovo has a habit of really messing up Android on its phones and tablets: the UI that's a clear iOS ripoff, the feature set is geared toward Chinese consumers, and they're crawling with bloatware. With that in mind, I have to congratulate. Lenovo for toning it down with the Phab2 Pro. This phone runs a mostly stock build of Android. The home screen is a very basic AOSP launcher with an app drawer, and the settings menu is unaltered. The quick settings has been skinned lightly, as have the notifications. The notifications might be my least favorite thing about the Phab2 Pro's software. For some reason, the snippet text in expanded notifications is black, whereas all the other text is white. It's very hard to read on dark backgrounds. Ambient display is enabled on this phone, but the display lights up with a dimmed version of the background wallpaper instead of using a clean black and. This is an LCD, so battery life shouldn't be an issue. There are very few pre-installed tools that take advantage of the Tango augmented reality features. If you want to do more than play around with augmented reality characters in the camera or measure things, you need to hit the Tango demo app. It lists featured Tango apps and provides a handy list of all the Tango content you have on your phone.. Augmented reality apps have existed before, but they have a tendency to lose track of where objects are supposed to be. These apps (like Pokemon GO) are just based on the device's orientation—they don't know how to track position in the real world. can do that, and they do it well. I really can't fault the technical implementation of Tango; it's undeniably cool. That's really as far as it goes, though. Is it useful or necessary? Not right now.. If you need to measure some things or try out some furniture in augmented reality, I'm sure Tango will offer a neat experience. Beyond that, I struggle to find a compelling use case. The Wayfair furniture visualizing app is a good example of Tango apps. It lets you place furniture in a room to see how it'll look. It works well, and I could see people actually getting some use out of it. how often are you shopping for furniture? I'd wager most people have had the same couch for at least five years. Are you going to buy a smartphone because of this feature? Probably not. The Dinosaurs Among Us app is probably my favorite Tango app right now. It's like the furniture app, but with dinosaurs instead of dining room sets. It's really fun! For about five minutes. It gets boring after you've put all four included dinos in your living room.. In fact, most of the Tango content we have right now consists of games. My issue with the games is that they feel like tech demos. You do the same thing over and over, which is fun at first because Tango is new. However, eventually you get bored with the shallow gameplay. For example, Fury of the Gods is a tower defense game where you rain down lightning on humans as they approach. It's one of the more elaborate Tango titles. You walk around the room, pointing the phone down at your targets. After a few minutes of gameplay, you realize you've been hunched over the floor walking in circles for what is essentially a mediocre tower defense game. Once the novelty wears off, there's nothing there.. The size of this phone is a problem, but I'm sure some people with big hands will disagree with that. In fact, some of them will probably be in the comments below to complain about the tyranny of bloggers with normal-sized hands. For most people, the Phab2 Pro is absolutely impractical. It's bigger and heavier than any other mainstream device that dares call itself a phone. I mean, Amazon sells a tablet that's smaller than the Phab2 Pro. This is one instance where I kind of wish the phone was made of plastic just so it wouldn't be so damn heavy.. The size combined with the placement of the Tango sensors on the back make the Phab2 Pro extremely awkward to use. The motion tracking camera is in the perfect place to get smudged with fingers every time you go for the fingerprint sensor. Aside from the ergonomic issues, the Phab2 Pro has very good build quality. It may even make a more effective murder weapon than the Cat S60 .. If all you want is a big phone, there are better options. The reason this phone exists is the Tango augmented reality hardware. It's not a slow phone, but most other $500 devices will be noticeably faster. This is the only phone that can put dinosaurs in your living room, though.. Google has been working on Tango for long enough that someone had to bite the bullet and release a phone. I guess Lenovo was willing to take the risk. Despite all the development time, Tango doesn't feel very compelling. Oh sure, it's fun to play with, but as the main focus of a phone it's unnecessary. The apps are of limited utility and the games are one-trick ponies.. If Tango has a future, it's not as the headlining feature. of a giant phone like the Phab2 Pro. You shouldn't have to make sacrifices to get unproven augmented reality. A single Tango device here and there will never attract enough developer attention, especially if they're as mediocre as the Phab2 Pro. Tango needs to be a common feature in phones, but I don't know if the nature of the sensors makes that feasible—they take up a lot of space in the Phab2 Pro.. I can't think of any good reason to recommend the Phab2 Pro unless you're irrationally interested in using or developing augmented reality apps. For everyone else, your $500 is better spent on other devices.. Tags augmented reality Google lenovo Project Tango Reviews.

"It may even make a more effective murder weapon than the Cat S60.". that's all I need it for :). can a brick put dinosaurs in your living room while knock someone down?? ;-). "If all you want is a big phone, there are better options.". It's almost the same phone for half the price, but without the Tango stuff.. It has to be imported and won't have a US warranty like this device.. How do you know where he lives?. How is it half the price? The low end version of the Mi Mix is $829 from Xiaomis official international distributor.. Have the Mix on my mind. Mi MAX and Mi MIX are different phones.. An official international distributor doesn't exist.. Yes I realize I misread, as I commented below. They do have an international distributor. If you go to their official website and click the add to Cart button on any item, it brings you to their distributor.. I would love to see what international distributor you're talking about. They have an international website, which you can't buy the Mi Mix from at all, so what you're looking at is, with 100% certainty, a fake website.. You are telling me this is a fake website? http://xiaomi-mi.com. You would think if it was a fake site, Xiaomi would have shut them down years ago, no? Type "Xiaomi global" into Google search, and it is the first result. Curious, what is your source on this being a fake site? I did a little lite research and couldn't find anything supporting that.. The fact that this here is the actual global site:. Type "Xiaomi" into Google and this is the first result.. It's not for sale in the US, though.. Pixel XL, Nexus 6P, S7 Edge, LG V20..... Pixel "XL" is actually Pixel "Regular," 5.5" is too small and should not be considered a "big phone. Nexus 6P you may be right there... but it's not over 6" and is getting older, S7 Edge is still more than $500, is smaller, and will be a year old soon. LG V20 definitely should get another look too, but is also over $500.. It seems like if you want a big phone, this Phap2 Pro, may actually be a good choice.. I own the XL and the 6P, and love them dearly , but they're dwarfed by the Phab2 Pro.. This is what I want the answser to. Google decided to make a tiny 5.5" screen as their "XL" phone, the note 7 was super explodey, the Asus ZenPhone Ultra (6.8" screen!) is not for sale in the US and not compatible with US LTE carriers even if you buy it online anyway... So, in the United States what other device for $500 has a big screen. When I say big, I mean at least 6" or more, which is also packing a 4050 mAh battery?. Yeah the Xiaomi Mi Mix is the only thing I'm looking into for my giant phone needs. It'll be replacing my Huawei P8 Max.. Looks retro and funky at the same time to me.. If you're talking about the orange/gray/cream one, it's a custom keyboard called a WhiteFox with GMK Carbon keycaps.. "This is the only phone that can put dinosaurs in your living room, though.". I put dinosaurs in my living room with my old Xperia Z1S's camera app with the AR Effects.. Technically true, but the difference is night and day between Sony's AR fun and Tango.. I thought that Lenovo were going to release all their future phones under the Moto brand? Maybe this one was still in the pipeline.. That announcement came after this phone's announcement. Drop that silly Tango stuff, give it Type-C, an SD 821, wireless charging, Moto-branding/skin and VZW compatibility and I'd buy one in an instant.. I am really wanting a modern flagship with VZ compatibility and a screen larger than 5.7".. This phone has seemingly been in the pipeline for ages so I am not surprised it still has Lenovo branding. I fully expect it to be DOA and get zero in the way of software support BUT it's still a cool device.. That comes on Verizon doesn't it?. Of course it does, in both VZ-branded and unlocked forms. I am typing this on a V10 now, in fact. I wish LG would dump the silly second screen and just go with a 6" QHD screen in the same formfactor.. Typo : fingerprint sensor is to low. Also, Xperia Z Ultra and ZenFone Ultra are bigger phones. I was sad Sony didn't do a sequel.. After spending a great deal of time with Snapdragon 820 series phones, I prefer the 652. 820/821s run like crap in day to day usage, they only perform quickly when taking a heavy load, such as high end gaming.. but after 5 minutes of a heavy load, they get way too hot. 652 runs smooth as butter working your way through the UI, photo apps, web browsing, ETC, and it never gets hot. Snapdragon is falling way behind in the elite tier of mobile processors.. I have a Tab S2 refresh with the 652 and it runs smooth as silk in every non-gaming task. Qualcomm had a better 2016 than they did 2015 but they still a smash success next year in order to redeem themselves.. I've had this phone for about a week and love it so far. I have always wanted a big phone and think this size is perfect. I think it's too big to carry around in a pocket, but with a shoulder bag I don't have to. I bought it strictly for the size so that I can work on it, using Word and Excel on it is easy with all that screen space. The only things I would change is the micro-USB cord to a Type C and would love if it had a wireless charger. There's not a lot of bloatware on it and it has dual Sim slots..

At 6.4-inches, good luck fitting the Phab2 Pro in your pocket.. more toward tablet territory than phablet, but a phablet it is nonetheless.. Getting the basic specs out of the way, you’ll find it’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 652, with 4GB of RAM. The Phab2 Pro comes with 64GB of internal storage, which is nice, considering several manufacturers still ship with 16GB or even 8GB starter options. That’s just not enough these days. If you want even more, there’s MicroSD card support, and you can double your storage up to 128GB.. The IPS display sports a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, and the edges of the glass are.

The US version is listed as having band 12 but I don't know how compatible it is with T-Mobile. I have no information if it does VoLTE or WiFi calling. If it has those features the ~$200 price would not be too bad.. Lenovo Phab 2 | Gaming & Multimedia Smartphone. This content has been marked as final.. Show 12 replies. Like Show 0 Likes (0).

Maybe you can pick it up and see how it works and if it is not compatible you can return it.. Like Show 1 Likes (1). ( in response to tmo_chris ). Someone on HowardForums ordered one and will report back after he's tested it. It seems like the only international LTE band on the USA model is band 7, which I guess is better than no international LTE compatibility at all. It does have UMTS bands 1 and 8, so it's a viable phone for international data roaming. I have not seen any information about carrier aggregation.. Too low-end to have band 10 or 66 at this point.. My old phone is holding up pretty nicely. I'm planning to hold off on any purchase until something comes along with the new 600 MHz band. They may not know the final channelization of 600 MHz until February.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to drnewcomb2 ). Here's a first look reported on HowardForums. The member who bought one says it does not seem to have either VoLTE or WiFi Calling. That would pretty much make it a non-starter for me.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to drnewcomb2 ).
