I was about to purchase the phone but your comments made me change my mind. I have a Samsung E 2252 phone and I am facing the same exact issue. Do you know of any other basic phone that can store sms on the memory card? Or at least a basic phone with big internal memory?. Graffiti, 26 Oct 2017 Better put a mem0ry card bef0re opening the app. Mine says'cannot open this app this time' whe... more Did you get a resolution to this issue?. Depending on where you buy it. I bought it a week ago in Vilnius, and yes, lietuviu kalba cia yra. Also as you would expect, Latvian, Estonian, Russian, English. But there is a big problem with this model - you can only store SMS's in phone memory, while you can choose to store MMS's in SD card. That means, you would someday overfill the phone memory with SMS's, while the SD memory stays empty - possibly waiting for your photos and videos, done with the 0.3 Mp camera... Unless somebody (who? Nokia? Microsoft?) would offer the upgrade of the operatying system, allowing to store SMS's in SD. Apparently, they wouldn't hurry to it, as complaints about it were back in 2016. Now, we live in 2018, and still face the situation of not receiving new SMS's, because the memory is overfull....

The software giant launches one last phone as it prepares to sell off its feature phone business.. Software giant Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) has unveiled the new Nokia 216, a low-end feature phone with a 2.4-inch QVGA display and 0.3 megapixel cameras (front and rear). The device will run the Series 30 operating system and can download apps and games from the Opera Mobile Store.. There is expandable memory and a replaceable battery, and the Nokia 216 will be priced at approximately $37 and will target emerging markets.. The announcement is a little curious, since Microsoft said it would sell its feature phone operations in May. The company is unloading the segment to Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile for $350 million, recouping a tiny fraction of what it paid. Most of the initial 2013 blockbuster deal's value has already evaporated in a massive writedown from last year.. This device was already in the pipeline and Microsoft is merely launching it prior to the closing of the sale to FIH Mobile, which is expected to occur in the second half of this year. Once upon a time, Microsoft dreamt of wooing feature phone users with Microsoft services, but those aspirations have fizzled out.. Evan Niu, CFA has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Nokia - Nokia + Microsoft - Microsoft + Official - Official +. Microsoft has just unveiled what could be its last Nokia phone. The new Microsoft Nokia 216, which also comes in a 'Slim' edition, is not the phone that Nokia fans have been waiting for, and that's mostly because it's not even a smartphone. Instead, it's a feature phone (a dumbphone) that runs on the Series 30+ operating system. A few months ago, Microsoft announced that it will be selling its Nokia feature phone division to FIH Mobile, a subdivision of Foxconn. But before the Foxconn subsidiary takes control over the Nokia branding for future dumbphones, Microsoft decided to take another shot at milking what turned out to be a very unproductive cash cow. The Microsoft Nokia 216 isn't designed with the US customer in mind, mostly because the vast majority of phone users in the US have migrated towards smartphones even for their backup phones. Instead, the Nokia 216 is aimed at developing markets. Dumbphone bashing aside, the Nokia 216 is actually a decent device if you don't care for apps and just want a phone with a long lasting battery. In terms of specifications, the Nokia 216 comes with a 2.4-inch display running at a resolution of 320 by 240 pixels. The handset comes with 16MB of RAM (no, that's not a typo). Other specs include 0.3MP cameras on both the front and the side and a 1020mAh battery.. The Nokia 216 comes in three color options: white, black, and teal:. At the moment, the price has yet to be unveiled, but judging on the specs and Microsoft's previous Nokia dumbphones, the Nokia 216 should be affordable. What do you guys think, isn't the Microsoft Nokia 216 an appropriate ending to the Nokia-Microsoft story?. Galaxy S9 vs iPhone X hands-on: A battle royale.

The features of this phone have been designed to cater our daily requisites in a nutshell. All in all, it is the price point of this device that appeals the most.. The new Nokia 216 from Microsoft is basic but an essential feature phone. This model is probably one of the last phones coming from Microsoft as the company has handed over this Nokia branding to a new subsidiary of Foxconn i.e. HMD Global (a Finnish mobile phone developer that is recently founded in 2016).. Meanwhile, this new release of Microsoft borrows some aesthetics from Lumia smartphones. Apart from its design, this new Nokia 216 has been developed to be very functional as it has more features which are not offered by other similar models.. The Microsoft Corporation is an American technology company that was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975. The company does all; develops, manufactures and sells personal computers and services, computer software and other consumer electronics.. The company's Microsoft Windows OS (and its different versions) are probably the most widely and commercially used computer operating system. Other popular software of Microsoft includes Internet Explorer, Edge web browser and Microsoft Office suite.. In terms of revenue generated in 2011, Microsoft was the largest computer software maker in the world. Some of the flagship hardware products of the company include Microsoft Surface tablet computer and Xbox video game console.. Microsoft Nokia 216 seems appealing right from the first glance as it has got a modern and stylistic design. The makers have used a polycarbonate shell throughout the body of this feature phone. All the four corners and body edges are sharp which characterizes a striking look.. Down below, the keys have an ergonomic arrangement and are color matched with its body. Apart from this, there's not much to look for as the design is pretty straightforward and elegant. Its removable rear panel has a clean layout with a Nokia badge. Overall, its dimensions measure 118 x 50.2 x 13.5 mm (4.65 x 1.98 x 0.53 inches).. This new Nokia 216 sports a 2.4 inches display that uses TFT (thin-film transistor) technology. Resolution of this display counts 240 x 320 pixels at 167 ppi pixel density and its screen-to-body ratio is kept in check at 30.1%.. Dual SIM connectivity with a dual standby is supported in mini SIM + mini SIM configuration and oddly enough, this phone only supports 2G (GSM). While using this Nokia 216 in dual-SIM mode, the Li-Ion 1020 mAh battery delivers talk time up to 18 hours and standby time of 456 hours.. With a single SIM use, this battery provides 47 hours of music play, 576 hours of standby and 18 hours of talk time. In terms of connectivity, Bluetooth v3.0 (with A2DP) is featured along with microUSB v1.1. There's a 0.3 MP camera at both front and rear and a LED flash has been used with the rear unit.. Moving on, the phonebook of this Nokia 216 supports as much as 2000 entries along with call records. What's interesting is that Microsoft has featured a dedicated microSD card slot with which users can use up storage capacity of up to 32 GB.. Although there are no exact confirmations of how well this Nokia 216 is selling in the Filipino tech market, the odds are pretty good. This mainly has to do with the popularity of both Microsoft and Nokia mobile phones in the Philippines. Other feature phones of the company including Nokia 230, 225, 215 and 150 are also now available in the country.. Will you be the first reviewer of this product? Please share your experience..

Interview with Pranav Shroff from HMD. Huawei P20 Lite final production images spotted on FCC February 17, 2018. Huawei is all set to launch new camera-centric smartphones in the coming months.

Nokia 7 and Nokia 6 (2018) get Android 8.0 Oreo update January 15, 2018. HMD Global announced the Nokia 6 (2018) smartphone earlier this month and the device is available in the Chinese market. While this smartphone brought in a few improvements in comparison to the previous generation model, it does not come with Android. Honor V10 globally launched: Price, features and specifications December 05, 2017. Huawei's sub-brand Honor brand has gone official with the Honor V10 at a global launch event held in London, U.K. However the smartphone was already launched in China much ahead of this launch. So we pretty much had a good idea. Oppo R11S gets listed on official Chinese website: Key specifications, features revealed October 26, 2017. After all the leaks and rumors, Oppo's upcoming smartphone Oppo R11S has just been listed on the company's official website. With this, the company might have little to say during the launch event which is scheduled for November 2 in China.. Upcoming Upcoming Upcoming Upcoming Upcoming.

It is not related to these platforms.. Many S30+ devices only support MAUI Runtime Environment (MRE) [1] [2] , but some later devices have included support for J2ME applications. Even for models that don't support Java J2ME applications, they are still capable of running built-in online applications such as the Opera Mini browser, Bing Search , MSN Weather and Skype 's GroupMe chat. Some S30+ models also come with an online shop that would allow downloading new apps and games. The platform was taken over from Nokia by Microsoft Mobile in 2014, and then by HMD Global in 2016, although all of those devices are still selling under the brand of Nokia.. 1 List of devices. 1.1 Made by Nokia. 1.2 Made by Microsoft. 1.3 Made by HMD.

Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. This might be the last Microsoft Nokia phone. Say hello (or goodbye) to the Nokia 216.. Microsoft's association with the Nokia brand has been especially turbulent , but it appears the company has one last hurrah for its feature phone business. Today, it announced the Nokia 216, a Series 30+ handset that can browse the web and lasts up to a month on standby. It's as basic as Nokia feature phones get, but it's notable in that it's probably the very last Nokia-branded handset Microsoft will ever produce.. You see, when Microsoft acquired Nokia in 2014, it bought both the feature phone business and Lumia brand. This gave the Redmond company access to Nokia's manufacturing plants, patents and feature phone brand for 10 years. Microsoft quickly dropped the "Nokia" from Lumia smartphones and hoped that interest in the Finnish company's budget handsets would "on-ramp" users to Windows Phone.. Microsoft, with next to no interest in its phones, then decided to sell the feature phone business to Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile for $350 million and the naming rights to Finnish company HMD Global , which was founded by ex-Nokia employees with the purpose of creating Nokia-branded Android smartphones and tablets.. Confusing, right? Don't forget that Nokia Oy, the company that sold its phone businesses to Microsoft in the first place, is still successful in its own right. It operates a multi-billion dollar cellular networking business , makes a $45,000 VR camera , bought wearable maker Withings and recently sold its mapping business to a group of German car makers for a tidy sum.. Microsoft's feature phone deal is still undergoing regulatory scrutiny but both companies expect it to complete by the end of the year. With October almost upon us, it's safe to assume that the Nokia 216, with its 0.3-megapixel camera and all-important headphone jack, will be the last new model out of the door before Microsoft can finally wash the unsuccessful Nokia venture out of its hair..
