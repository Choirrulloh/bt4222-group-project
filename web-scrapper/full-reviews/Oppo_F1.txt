Press enter or click on the search icon. The Oppo F1 is an affordable phone that does its best to keep its low cost under wraps. It’s not all-plastic, and doesn’t have the chunk factor of the Moto G 3rd gen .. It costs £169, making it a similar price to the 2GB RAM version of that phone at the time of writing.. Aside from a few little quibbles about the screen and the rear camera, it’s a good value phone if you don’t want to stretch to the price and buying inconvenience of the OnePlus X. Video: What’s the no.1 phone right now?. The Oppo F1 is a phone with quite a lot of metal on its body. You’ll see this sort of construction in cheaper Huawei phones, but not unusually those from companies like Samsung or Sony. Take the Samsung Galaxy J3 as an example: it’s almost all-plastic.. Here much of the rear is real metal, aluminium. It has a golden colour to it (pink also available), but not the sort of bling-soaked shade that’ll make some of you embarrassed to take the Oppo F1 out of your pocket.. Particularly from the back, the phone looks like it might sell for £200-300, rather than £170. The cool-to-the-touch metal tries to convince your fingers of the same thing too.. Look a little closer and you’ll see how Oppo has pulled off this feat. Only a plain rectangle is aluminium. The sides and the curvy bottom bits on the rear are plastic. This makes the more fiddly parts of the phone easier to produce, and also means Oppo doesn’t have to engineer the phone super-carefully just to ensure it can get a good signal. Wireless transmitters don’t work well through a metal shell.. You can tell the edges are plastic from the feel, but after a few weeks of use, it’s not actually the plastic that I’ve managed to damage, but the screen. This is down to some typical misjudgement of which pocket to put the phone in, as the Oppo F1 has about as good screen protection as you could hope for, using a sheet of Gorilla Glass 4 with ‘2.5D’ edges that curve around at the sides.. In-hand the Oppo F1 is a bit of a budget delight. It may look like a rectangular brick, similar to a Sony Xperia phone, but the metal, plastic and glass layers in each side are all carefully curved or bevelled. The edges aren’t 100 per cent smooth thanks to all those seams, but they are rounded off in a manner that feels good.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

The one bit I might change if given the chance would be to add light-up soft keys. As-is, you get subtle silver icons showing where each key sits, but you won’t see them in a pitch black room. It’s no major issue: I find all three buttons easy to reach.. The phone has 16GB storage, and you can add to it with a microSD card. you don’t often see in such affordable phones is how the tray works. This is a unibody-style phone, one with a metal tray that holds the SIM and SD cards. If you don’t need extra storage you can even use the memory card slot as a second nano SIM socket.. You don’t get much more ‘Oppo’ than offering unusual features like this.. The Oppo F1 display is much more conventional. Like the Moto G 3rd gen, it is a 5-inch 720p LCD screen. This size and resolution has become the classic entry-level standard.. It’s sharp enough to keep most people happy, and colours look reasonably natural. Using the phone for a few weeks at a time, I was mostly perfectly happy with the experience.. Related: Best affordable smartphones 2016. The one niggle is that the auto brightness setting isn’t as good as the one of some rivals. It can leave the Oppo F1 looking that bit too dim or bright, acting as if every little change was costing it some of its pocket money.. The display can go bright out to deal with sunny days reasonably well, though.. Comparing the Oppo F1 to other recent phones, it appears to have an ever-so-slightly dated screen architecture. The display looks a tiny bit recessed, something that also results in brightness loss at an angle. Aside from the auto brightness issues, which, bizarrely, seem to get better the more the phone is used, this is a screen few will take issue with.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

OPPO F1 Plus review Thin, sleek and elegant with a 16MP front facing camera for selfie lovers. by Gary Sims April 11, 2016. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Possibly the best selfie camera out there. Color OS might be not be to everyone's liking. Could do with a slightly better CPU. Looks too similar to the iPhone. Features like the 4GB of RAM, the 64GB of storage, Corning Gorilla Glass 4, VOOC fast charging, and the fingerprint reader are solid positives for this device. Add a great rear camera plus a front camera made for selfie junkies and the F1 Plus becomes a serious contender. Color OS might not be for everyone, however I found it a pleasure to use. Aside from a dated processor, there's very little not to like about the Oppo F1 Plus!. Display 5.5 inch AMOLED, 1920x1080, FHD, 400PPI. Processor MediaTek Helio P10: Quad-core 64-bit Cortex-A53 2.0 GHz + Quad-core Cortex-A53 1.2 GHz. Camera Main camera: 13.0MP AF f/2.2. Connectivity Wi-Fi: 2.4/5GHz 802.11 a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, USB 2.0. Storage 64GB, expandable up to 128GB. Software Color OS 3.0, based on Android 5.1. Dimensions 151.8 mm x 74.3mm x 6.6mm. SIM Card Type Dual Nano-SIM, but one slot doubles as the microSD card slot. The OPPO F1 Plus, which is known as the. OPPO R9 in China , has got a lot going for it including a. 16MP front camera (yes, front camera), a. sleek 6.6-mm body, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage. On top of that you get a 5.5-inch Full HD display covered in Gorilla Glass 4, a fingerprint reader, and VOOC fast charging technology.. A nice feature set, but the question is did OPPO manage to turn all those nice individual features into a good smartphone? Let’s find out in this full Oppo F1 Plus review!. While there is lots to talk about when it comes to the F1 Plus, we need to get something out of the way before we start: the design language. When you look at the OPPO F1 Plus you will probably think it looks much like another well-known smartphone, one which has a fruity logo. For some people the similarity is actually a good thing, for some it doesn’t matter, and for others it is a little disturbing. Depending on which category you are in you will either love the design of the F1 Plus or hate it.. Putting aside the seeming lack of original design language, the OPPO F1 Plus is a pleasure to behold. It is sleek, thin and feels comfortable in the hand. On the front you get a. Gorilla Glass 4 along with a physical home button that incorporates a fingerprint reader.. Going around the rest of the phone, the volume rocker is on the left, while the dual-SIM tray and power button is on the right.. On the bottom is the micro-USB port, the single speaker and the 3.5mm headphone jack. On the back is the rear facing camera along with its flash LED, plus the OPPO logo. two bands that run across the back, near the top and bottom, that give the OPPO F1 Plus a certain iPhone-esque look.. The device is available in two colors: Gold and Rose Gold. My review unit is the Rose Gold (some might say Pink) version.. OPPO F1 Plus comes with a high quality. 5.5-inch Full HD display along with. The display is bright, and works well indoors and outdoors. 1920 x 1080 in 5.5 inches gives a pixel density of 400ppi, which for a phone in the premium mid-range segment is more than sufficient. The viewing angles are good and the bezels are amazing. At just 1.66mm thick, the lack of any significant bezels give the display and edge to edge feel without incurring the costs of a curved display.. One interesting feature of Color OS 3.0 on the F1 Plus is the eye protection settings. According to OPPO there is research which shows that short-wave blue light can be harmful to eyes. The eye protection display feature filters out the blue light to give a less jarring experience that is “gentle on the eyes.” Marketing or science? I don’t know, but I like OPPO’s thinking.. The OPPO F1 Plus boasts 4GB of RAM, a finger print reader and quick charging. The only slight let down is the choice of processor. The F1 Plus uses a MediaTek. an octa-core processor with 8 Cortex-A53 cores. Four cores are clocked at 1.2GHz and the other four cores clocked at 2.0GHz. In terms of every day use these specs are adequate and most users won’t find themselves wishing for a different. CPU, and because of that nice 4GB of RAM even some die hard power users will find the F1 Plus more than. However if you play a lot of 3D games, visit a lot of complex websites or use CPU intensive apps then the Helio P10 could prove to be a little lacking in performance.. The use of a Cortex-A53 octa-core SoC is also reflected in the benchmarks. The OPPO F1 Plus scored 876. on Geekbench’s single-core test and 3311. For some context, those scores are lower than the octa-core Cortex-A53 Kirin 935 found in the Huawei Mate S, and lower than the. octa-core Cortex-A53 MediaTek Helio X10 found in the Redmi Note 2. Also the single core Geekbench score is lower than that of the 32-bit Snapdragon 801, however the multi-core score of the F1 Plus is higher. If you want to see more benchmark scores for some of 2015’s. leading processors then check out my. SoC showdown: Snapdragon 810 vs Exynos 7420 vs MediaTek Helio X10 vs Kirin 935 .. For AnTuTu the F1 Plus scored 51158 and for Epic Citadel the device manages 42.4 frames per second in Ultra High Quality mode, and 59.4 fps in High Quality mode. So, while the octa-core Cortex-A53 CPU scores are towards the low end, it seems that MediaTek have made the right choice when it comes to the GPU.. The fingerprint reader on the F1 Plus is very good. It is fast, accurate and is certainly comparable with the lightning. fast and reliable fingerprint scanner on the Huawei Mate 8. However, unlike the Mate 8, which has its fingerprint reader on the back, you can’t wake and unlock your phone just by putting your finger on the reader. Instead you need to press the home button with your finger, which will wake the phone and then unlock it in one operation. It is a minor difference, but my personal preference is for non-home button fingerprint readers. If it is any consolation, the Samsung Galaxy S and Galaxy Note ranges suffer from the same “problem”, in my honest opinion.. The F1 Plus features a single speaker on the bottom edge, next to the micro USB port. The speaker is quite loud and the sound is reasonable considering it isn’t a front facing speaker. As with many devices, music can sound a bit thin with a lack of bass.. The F1 Plus has a 2850 mAh battery, which is amazing when you consider how thin OPPO has made this device.. Although it has a 5.5 inch 1080p display, the processor is quite conservative in its power usage, the result is that you will get all-day battery life, easily.. First I ran Epic Citadel to test the battery life while playing 3D games. According to my calculations you will be able to play 3D games for over 4.5 hours on the OPPO F1 Plus. That is quite an impressive number as some phones fail to provide 4 hours of screen-on time, even without. As for simpler tasks like browsing the web, you will get at least 8 hours from a full charge, or you. can watch YouTube videos (streamed over Wi-Fi) for at least 8 hours.. I did a call test where I called another phone for 30 minutes and monitored the battery life. My estimation is that the F1 Plus will give you at least 20 hours of 3G talk time.. charging, the F1 Plus supports OPPO’s. According to my tests you can charge the F1 Plus from 0 to 75% in just 35 minutes, which is very impressive. More impressive is the overall charge time which takes just 1 hour and 9 minutes (from 0% to 100%). When you factor in a temperature rise of less than 4 degree Celsius during the whole charging cycle, I. have to admit that VOOC is a premium fast charging system.. If you want to know why smartphones charge quickly to 50% or 80%, but can take over half of the charge cycle to add the last 20% then I recommend that you read my test:. Qualcomm Quick Charge vs Oppo VOOC vs MediaTek PumpExpress+ vs Motorola TurboPower vs the others .. For as for the software, the F1 Plus uses. OPPO’s Color OS which means you don’t get stock Android but rather a very heavily skinned system based on Android 5.1.. As with many of the Android variants from Chinese manufacturers, there is no app drawer which means you are left to organize everything into folders on the home screens.. On the plus side you get fully access to Google’s apps including the Play Store, Chrome, YouTube and so on. This means that the Android experience beyond the launcher and settings page is fairly standard, it also means that you can install alternative launchers like the Google Now launcher without any problems.. Although almost all parts of the UI have been redesigned,. from the Recent Apps screen to even the volume controls, I must say that every re-designed element has a purpose and/or looks cool. All the animations and eye candy have a unified look and feel, which means overall you get a. lot of extra features including a one-handed mode, that is easy to launch by simply swiping up from either bottom corner to the middle of the display, plus gestures like drawing symbols to launch specific apps, and double tap to wake.. There is also software for the fingerprint reader; a “quiet time” mode, which will mute your. device automatically according to the times you set; support for O-Cloud, OPPO’s cloud service for backing up your contacts and SMS messages; and a security center app, which includes virus scanning, privacy settings and an app clean up service.. The rear camera on the F1 Plus has a 13MP sensor along with a f/2.2 lens and auto-focus. Overall I have been very impressed by the camera. I have used it for closeups, selfies, and casual snaps, both indoors and outdoors and the camera really hasn’t put a foot wrong. Of course, the caveat to that statement is that this is a smartphone and not a DSLR. Also a camera sensor, no matter how good it is, can’t capture light that isn’t there. I was particularly impressed by the indoor shots. Of course if you push the lightning scenario to extremes you will get lots of noise in the photos. I have included such a shot in the gallery below.. In terms of the camera app, you get a simple camera interface by default, however you can swipe your way into different shooting modes, including time lapse, video, beauty and panorama.. You can also tap on an icon to reveal functions like ultra HD, filters, GIF animation, double exposure, and expert mode. The latter allows you to control the ISO, shutter speed and white balance. However it also lets you configure the camera to save a RAW version of every shot taken, in .DNG (Digital Negative) format, plus you can manually focus your shots.. My biggest complaint with the camera app is that it doesn’t really rotate the UI when you move from portrait to landscape. Although some elements do move, many of them remain in portrait mode, which is quite annoying.. The OPPO F1 Plus is very unusual in that the front facing camera actually has a greater megapixel count than the rear facing camera! The front facing camera has a 16MP sensor along with a. However, like most front facing cameras it is a fixed focus arrangement. Because of the increased megapixel count on the front facing camera, OPPO is marketing the F1 Plus as the “Selfie Expert.” But there is more to the front facing camera than just more mega pixels. Hi-Light technology which according to OPPO is “four times more sensitive, with twice the dynamic range and is able to captures shots with four. The software for the front facing camera has also been upgraded and tweaked. Beautify 4.0 mode, for smoothing out those wrinkles and covering up those blemishes, plus support for the new selfie panorama mode, which is designed for group shots.. to help you judge the camera for yourself:. The OPPO F1 Plus is certainly an interesting device. It is thin, light and easy to hold. However the resemblance to Apple devices could leave you desiring something more. Having said that, if you are able to look past the design language. then features like the 4GB of RAM, the 64GB of storage, Corning Gorilla Glass 4, VOOC fast charging, and the fingerprint reader are solid positives for this device.. Add a great rear camera plus. a front camera made for selfie fans. and the F1 Plus becomes a serious contender. Color OS might not be for everyone, however I found it a pleasure to use. The only thing I would want to change on the hardware side is the processor, Cortex-A53 octa-core based devices are very 2014. But for the price point, maybe I am just. nitpicking, plus it does help the battery life.. Oppo , Oppo F1 Plus , Selfie.

The Oppo F1 is a top phone for those after a budget handset that most people won't be familiar with, especially as it can pass for something a lot more expensive. Its software may take a while to get used to though.. The Oppo F1 is a phone with a mission. It wants to trick people into thinking you spent £300 ($450, AU$550) or more on a handset when you actually only forked out £160 ($249, AU$285).. It does a good job too. Thin and with lots of metal on show, it comes across as quite a bit more expensive than the Moto G , even though it's actually around the same price.. If you want a budget handset that people won't instantly recognize, the Oppo F1 is a top choice. And in the UK at least, it's much easier to get hold of than most Oppo phones TechRadar has reviewed to date.. Weight : 134g Dimensions : 143.5 x 71 x 7.3mm OS : Android 5.1 Screen size : 5-inch Resolution : 720 x 1280 CPU : Snapdragon 616 RAM : 3GB Storage : 16GB Battery : 2,500mAh Rear camera : 13MP Front camera : 8MP. But there is also now competition in the form of the Oppo F1 Plus. The F1 Plus is now available around the world and we gave it three and a half stars out of five - so it's worth reading our review and checking you don't want the Plus instead of the Oppo F1.. If you do want the Plus instead, be warned it'll cost quite a bit more at £299 (AU$599, around US$430).. How do you make something cheap seem expensive? That's a tough one for many designers, because if you get it wrong you might end up with a phone encrusted with plastic diamonds that you couldn't even sell on eBay.. Oppo has nailed the 'cheap expensive' look here, though. It's all about putting in 20% of the effort/cost for 80% of the returns.. The prime Oppo F1 tactic is using champagne-finish gold metal for the back, but sneakily switching to plastic for the sides. You get the feel of metal, but Oppo doesn't have to go to the trouble of cutting any ports into metal, which costs a fair bit to do right.. When I first opened up the Oppo F1 and had a close look at it, I experienced a twinge of disappointment when I realised that this was how Oppo managed to make a metal phone at this price.. However, a month on I still appreciate the feel of the metal back. Just don't enter into this relationship expecting something that feels exactly like an iPhone 6S .. It's not too far off, though. It has none of the chunk factor of some other good budget Android phones, and there's a smooth curvature to the sides of the Oppo F1 that means it doesn't feel boxy. The display is even covered with 2.5D Gorilla Glass, which is toughened and has a smoothed-off edge.. The Oppo F1 is out to deliver on a whole load of s-words: skinny, smooth, sleek. It also looks great, at least from the back – I wouldn't have flinched if someone told me the phone cost £300/$400.. The Oppo F1 isn't quite as pretty from the front, though – viewed face-on the handset exhibits a slight boxiness that doesn't affect the rest of the phone. And, like the OnePlus X , it has soft keys but they don't light up.. Still, this is one of the nicest-looking cheap handsets out there, only obviously upstaged by the OnePlus X, which costs roughly the same in the US and just £30 more in the UK, yet uses almost no visible/proddable plastic. Competing with OnePlus in the pricing stakes isn't easy, though.. Finishing touches that help the Oppo F1 'fake it to make it' include a non-removable back and a SIM card tray like you'd see in an iPhone; a lot of cheaper devices still use peel-off back covers that hide a less fancy SIM slot..

Oppo's F1 is a stunning phone in need of a serious software makeover. Oppo’s F1 has superb selfie skills, but its software is a mess and you can’t use it in the States.. Oppo’s F1 has superb selfie skills, but its software is a mess and you can’t use it in the States.. Oppo’s F1 has superb selfie skills, but its software is a mess and you can’t use it in the States.. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. If a selfie stick never leaves your side, and your Instagram feed is filled with pictures of your own face, then a smartphone with an excellent front-facing camera will be high on your to-buy list. What was once a niche requirement is way more sought after today, and almost every smartphone will take decent selfies. Oppo says its new F1 phone is a selfie expert and its face-snapping abilities are the main reason to pick up the sleek device.. With so many great selfie-focused smartphones out there, the Oppo F1’s camera needs to be pretty amazing to standout, and you’ll want to know if the device is worth buying in the first place. We have spent time with the phone to see if it’s up to snuff.. Front-facing cameras on smartphones used to be an after thought, but now that selfies are in vogue, the front shooter is equally important. Oppo focused on making the best selfie camera in the world, and that effort shows.. The F1’s 8-megapixel front camera does an amazing job of making you look prettier, younger, and like you’ve had a full night’s sleep. The camera has a typical beautify mode with three different settings — weak, medium, and strong. The midway point produces the best effect, in our opinion. It smooths everything out, balances skin tone, brightens eyes, and minimizes shadow to create a selfie that’s still you — not some alien imposter pretending to be you. The result is just a bit more attractive than how you actually look in real life.. The F1’s 8-megapixel front camera does an amazing job of making you look prettier, younger, and well rested.. Oppo borrows gesture controls from other smartphones, so that you can snap a selfie with a gesture instead of tapping a button, or activate the shutter by saying “cheese.” The gesture was much more useful, and it actually worked nearly every time we tried it, but the voice activation didn’t activate the camera consistently.. The large quarter-inch sensor and f/2.0 aperture help suck in more light and detail, and there’s a screen flash mode that cleverly assesses the amount of available light, then adjusts the brightness of the screen accordingly. You’re just going to have to trust me, because the selfies I’ve taken to test the F1 (and it’s more than I’ve taken in my whole life up to this point combined) aren’t going to be published without a fight. If the front camera is the F1’s big feature, its back camera should be just as good. On paper, it certainly sounds like a strong performer. The back camera on the F1 sports a 13-megapixel sensor, phase-detection autofocus, some anti-shake trickery, and a host of Oppo features. However, the f/2.2 aperture makes it less capable in low light than the front camera, and it’s not as great as the selfie cam in other respects, either. It’s not that the camera takes bad photos, but it struggles in certain situations. It’s prone to washing images out, and that aperture size means pictures taken on overcast days came out poorly.. The HDR mode doesn’t cope well, either, and while it balances shadow well, it takes away much of the color and beauty from the rest of the shot. It’s probably nothing a software tweak wouldn’t cure, but it’s a shame. Other features include a panorama mode, an Ultra HD picture mode, live filters, and a manual-style slow shutter mode that operates between 1/4 and 16 seconds.. Perhaps the most irritating thing about the F1’s camera experience is the lack of a shortcut to open the camera app from the lock screen. There’s usually one in a corner somewhere, but on the F1 Oppo wants you to use a gesture, which involves tracing the letter O on the locked screen with your finger. We had an 80 percent success rate with the gesture, which is very inconvenient when you need to capture a moment in a flash. It’s also far slower and less reliable than simply tapping a button would be. Speed is important for a camera shortcut on a phone, and the F1’s gesture is not nearly as fast as the phone’s name may suggest.. Oppo means what it says about the F1, it’s a real selfie expert. It’s just a shame the expertise didn’t continue over to the rear camera.. The unfortunate situation with the camera shortcut button is one of several annoyances with Oppo’s ColorOS user interface, which is painted on top of Google’s Android 5.1.1 operating system. Oppo adds its own look and features to Android, in an effort to differentiate it from other Android phones, but we usually prefer to use Google’s unfiltered edition, as found on Nexus and some Motorola devices.. There’s no app tray on the F1, which is bearable, but the pre-installed apps are far less acceptable. There’s the usual calendar, email, weather, contacts, and messaging client, plus a calculator, a backup and restore app, a file manager, a video player, a download manager, a compass, and so on. Right at the bottom of the usefulness list is one called Lock Now. What does it do? It locks the screen. Yes, it performs the exact same action that happens when you press the sleep/wake key on the side of the device itself. None of the pre-installed apps can be uninstalled, either, which is a real crime.. The odd decisions continue when you want to close some running apps. Tap the usual menu button under the screen, and there’s a helicopter view of all the homescreens and the option to add widgets or change themes. If you want to close apps, you must long press the button. Why? At least put the expected feature first, Oppo, then correspond your own feature with the long press. What’s worse is the helicopter view still activates when you long press the home screen, just like you’d expect. It’s such a waste of time and duplicating features is unnecessary.. There’s an extensive choice of themes available for the F1, and Color OS is perfectly smooth and fast to use under normal circumstances. However, swapping it out for Google’s own Launcher is a wise step, if you’re used to a more standard Android experience without the extra fuss.. There are also concerns over the version of Android that’s on the F1.After all, Android 5.1.1 is already a year old. There’s no indication of any software updates coming to bring the F1 up to date, which may leave it vulnerable to security problems in the future. Now that major hacks like Stagefright and Heartbleed have hit, it’s especially important to get timely OS updates. Although no Android phone maker is really that reliable with updates, Oppo’s record isn’t very encouraging.. The phone itself is an utter joy to hold. The body is made from metal apart from two plastic end caps for the antenna array, and a 2.5D piece of Gorilla Glass over the screen. The curved glass and the metal chassis blend together smoothly, resulting in supreme in-hand comfort.. The F1’s 5-inch screen makes for a compact phone, and it weighs just 134 grams. Although the back is metal, there’s enough texture to it that it doesn’t feel too slippery in your hands. The iPhone 6S is considerably smoother, and therefore more slippery, than the F1. We’d argue that the Oppo F1 is just as nice to hold as the iPhone.. It’s important to point out that the unlocked, contract-free Oppo F1 costs just £170/$250. Although the spec sheet isn’t mind blowing, the F1 is a desirable budget phone. Thankfully, Oppo didn’t hamper the F1 with a low-power chip. Instead, it chose an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor and 3GB of RAM.. With that kind of power inside, the F1 is a surprisingly capable phone for mobile games. Bullet-hell shooter Danmaku Unlimited often flummoxes MediaTek phones, but it played superbly in HD mode on the F1 — even on the devilishly difficult expert mode. While playing Riptide GP 2 , the F1 didn’t stutter when we turned up graphics and shadows to maximum. That’s impressive for a phone at this price point.. None of the pre-installed apps can be uninstalled, either, which is a real crime.. Putting the phone through a few benchmark tests reveals what we already know. It’s no screaming flagship phone, but offers strong performance at a sensible cost. AnTuTu gives it 36,520, 3DMark’s Slingshot ES 3.0 scores 431, and Geekbench 3 has a single core score of 604, and a multi-core of 2,621. AnTuTu’s score is considerably more than the average 26,000 for the 3rd generation Moto G, but slightly lower than the OnePlus X, which should be considered a close contender.. The 5-inch screen only has a 1,280 x 720 pixel resolution, and unfortunately, it’s not all that bright. Only increasing the brightness to above 80 percent revealed much-needed detail, but jacking up the brightness had an adverse effect on the battery life. This is a slim phone, and the battery isn’t massive. The longest we ever got out of the F1 on a single charge was just over a day of use. There’s no sign of Oppo’s VOOC fast charging system — which returns a 75 percent battery charge in just 30 minutes — on this phone, either.. In the U.K., Oppo provides a one-year warranty on the phone, but restricts it to six-months for the battery, and it covers normal usage. Plunge it in the bath or drop it on the street, and you’ll be out of luck.. It was a refreshing change to carry around a sensibly sized, low-weight Android phone, especially when that Android phone has head-turning looks without the wallet-emptying price. The Oppo F1’s performance is first rate, it’s got a MicroSD card slot to add internal storage space, and the selfie cam is superb. However, the average rear camera, pointless software alterations, needless pre-installed apps, and mediocre battery life hold it back from being a truly great budget phone. It’s also a shame there’s no fingerprint sensor, although the new, more expensive Oppo F1 Plus. adds this feature, so the F1 won’t ever support mobile payment systems like Android Pay.. Perhaps the most annoying aspect of all is that the Oppo F1 isn’t setup for U.S. Just like the OnePlus X, the F1 has bands for the U.K. and European 4G networks, but it’s more or less unusable in North America. bargain phone hunters should consider the Moto G , or the Huawei Honor 5X , which also has an excellent selfie camera and a fingerprint sensor. Both cost around $200 without a contract. buyers, the slightly more expensive OnePlus X. Perfection is unlikely for a phone with a $250 price tag, and although selfie fans may be tempted, we really can’t recommend the Oppo F1.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

Oppo brings us a solid budget offering — though one that proves that an entry-level phone still means navigating a maze of compromises.. The budget space is one of the most competitive and exciting areas of the smartphone marketplace right now. In early 2016, $200-400 — or the local equivalent — can now get you a shockingly good handset without any of the usual contract-related strings attached. Many of the most competitive brands in this space are new upstarts and Chinese phone makers who've yet to make it big in the West.. Among them is Oppo — a huge phone brand in China, but not a name recognized by those outside the technology bubble in Western markets. The company has always produced head-turning designs, including the ridiculously thin R5 and the camera-rotating N1. But like local rival Huawei, its highly-customized software has been a point of contention.. The latest affordable phone from Oppo is the F1, priced at just £169 on Amazon in the UK. At that price, it goes up against the likes of the 2015 Moto G and the Huawei-made Honor 5X. So how does it shape up? Read on to find out!. An entry-level phone with premium aspirations.. On the outside, the Oppo F1 looks every bit the premium smartphone. There's a 5-inch display with gently tapered edges on the front, and attractive metal back and grippy, polished trim. Like the Honor 5X, it looks much classier than its price tag would suggest. Unlike that phone, though, the metal has a matte texture to it, so the in-hand feel mostly matches its high-end looks.. It's a comfortable fit in hand, with gentle curves that improve the ergonomics without making the phone feel slippery.. But look closely and the high-end illusion begins to fade. Though it looks metal, the outer trim of the F1 is in fact plastic. And the screen also has an odd plasticky texture, and lacks any kind of oleophobic coating — as does the factory-fitted screen protector. The F1's plastic parts aren't a huge deal — after all, most phones under the £200 mark are all-plastic affairs anyway. But the smudgy, fingerprinty screen is an unfortunate compromise, and sadly one that's shared by the Honor 5X as well.. Being the main input and output device, the display is important, and its tendency to attract fingerprints isn't its only weakness. It sports an ample 720p resolution (giving a density of 294 pixels per inch) and looks pretty decent indoors. Take it outdoors though, and there are some visibility issues, even at the highest brightness level.. Fortunately the phone performs a little better when it comes to audio, with the rear-facing speaker producing sound that's loud, if a little tinny, at high volume levels.. Between a lack of oleophobic coating and outdoor visibility issues, the F1's screen is pretty weak.. On the inside there's a Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 processor powering the Oppo F1 — a slightly updated version of the more common Snapdragon 615. Qualcomm's current mid-range SoC is more than capable of handling Android on a 720p display, and as such performance is quick smooth throughout the UI. Oppo's ColorOS — which sits atop Android 5.1 Lollipop — features plenty of swooping, iOS-style animations, and there's no lag to be found anywhere at all. (That's in stark contrast to other devices using this chip with a 1080p display.). ColorOS also brings back the legacy menu key — something we haven't seen in a high-profile Android phone in the West for literally years at this point. Oppo's software still relies on this menu toggle in places, and that's at odds with the way Google's been doing things for, well, the past five years at this point. The result of this odd button choice is that you'll need to long-press the menu key to switch apps on the fly, which is kinda tedious in comparison to basically every other Android phone.. It's just one of a few weird design decisions in ColorOS which, we'll explore a little later.. As for memory, you're looking at an ample 3GB of RAM — which is a lot for an entry-level phone like this — and 16GB of storage, expandable via microSD. And that SD slot is contained in the same tray as the second SIM slot, meaning you can use either one SIM and one SD card at a time, or two SIMs, but not all three concurrently. We found that the F1's SIM-switching capabilities worked as expected — both SIMs can be active at once, but only one can be used for 4G data at any one time. (That's all pretty standard for a dual-SIM smartphone.). The F1 boasts one of the best cameras in its price range.. If the Oppo F1 is a mixed bag in some other areas, imaging is a big part of what sets it apart from the budget-priced competition. The phone benefits from Oppo's full-featured camera app, also found on more expensive phones like the R7 and R7s, bringing a wealth of shooting modes. There are smartphone staples like HDR, filters, panorama and beautification modes, as well as more unique options like a built-in GIF recorder and "Ultra HD," which takes a series of exposures over several seconds. This is then number-crunched into an image measuring in at some 53 megapixels which sometimes (but not always) captures more fine detail than a regular 13-megapixel shot.. But you don't really need to rely on these fancy shooting modes to get good photos out of either the 13-megapixel rear shooter or the 8-megapixel front-facer. Both are surprisingly competent for a budget phone, with a little grain up-close, but otherwise adequate fine detail and no weird color anomalies. Blacks tend to be a little crushed, but we've also noticed that dynamic range on the whole is better than both the Honor 5X and Moto G 2015.. Pictures soon become noisy and mushy in low light, though the front camera does a decent job of keeping things relatively crisp in challenging indoor situations.. Overall, the F1 delivers more camera than you'd expect for your money at this price point, and a challenge to others selling entry-level Android phones: If you're selling any smartphone — even a cheap one — the camera can't afford to be an afterthought.. We've touched briefly on Oppo's ColorOS software, which runs alongside Android 5.1 Lollipop on the F1, and bringing with it some odd design regressions like the return of a physical menu key. And from a Western perspective, much of Oppo's UI seems unfamiliar and contrary, in design terms, to the way Google does Android. It's a point we've raised many times before in relation to Huawei's EMUI — it looks and feels like it was designed for the Chinese market.. And like Huawei's software, there's a lot of iOS influence to be found in ColorOS, from the Springboard-style launcher to the swooping animation style and folder layout and the basic structure of the camera app. But this isn't a straight iOS clone — Oppo has its own visual style mixed in, which comes off as a little regressive. It looks and feels more like the HTC Sense UI of years past, with bezeled buttons, big, detailed icons, overflow animations and gradients aplenty.. Of course you can change the way much of ColorOS looks though the built-in themes system, but most of the themes to be found online are just as overbearing as the default skin.. On a functional level, ColorOS works pretty well. As mentioned, performance is consistently quick, and none of the bundled apps look terrible. Nor is it loaded with bloatware — the most offensive piece of software we found was the "Security center" app, which frequently throws up notification nags about speeding up and cleaning out your phone.. So if you're used to the way Android looks and works on a Nexus, Samsung, HTC or LG phone, ColorOS is going to take some adjustment, and might even be a reason to pass on the Oppo F1 altogether. But if you can learn to live with its quirks — or even use its many customization options to tweak it to your liking, there's not much else to complain about.. The same is true of battery life from the fixed 2,500mAh cell. The F1 manages full, solid day of use, including moderate web browsing on LTE with two SIMs inserted (we used EE and Three UK SIMs in our review unit.) Screen-on time clocked in at around 3.5 to 4 hours over a full working day on Wi-Fi and LTE, which is a respectable number for a phone in this category.. Overall, the Oppo F1 is a solid mid-range phone, and great value for £169 unlocked in the UK. But as much as it illustrates how far budget smartphones have come, it also demonstrates the compromises that remain — a rather disappointing screen, software that's not in tune with what you'd expect from an Android phone, and a metal body that's still got quite a bit of plastic going on.. But should you take the plunge, you'll find a phone with speedy performance, useful dual-SIM features and one of the best camera experiences in a cheap handset.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL.

The Oppo F1 has a premium design, thanks to the fact that it's made out of metal treated "with zircon sand surface coating" - which supposedly makes the surface softer to touch. Sporting a 5-inch display with 720 x 1280 pixels and Gorilla Glass 4, the Oppo F1 runs Color OS 2.1 (based on Android 5.1 Lollipop), and is powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor. Oppo says that the F1 is a "selfie expert", as it has an 8 MP front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture (this lets in more light). To further help with selfies in low light conditions, the screen of the F1 can act as a flash. The Oppo F1 also features a 13 MP rear camera, LTE connectivity, dual SIM support, 3 GB of RAM, and 16 GB of expandable internal memory. Its battery is a 2500 mAh non-removable one.. OS: Android (5.1), OPPO ColorOS UI. Dimensions: 5.65 x 2.80 x 0.29 inches (143.5 x 71 x 7.25 mm). Weight: 4.73 oz (134 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 4), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Octa-core, 1700 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

Jules Wang January 28, 2016 2:00 am. OPPO F1 First Impressions: Selfies May Save This Phone Software Rear camera Selfies Stay tuned. The OPPO F1 does not have an engine. It does not pull hairpin turns. And it most certainly will not crash into a heaping pile of flames. But you can drive its eight processor cores up to 1.7GHz. It’s manageable enough in the hand to toss around. And while it is possible to crash it in a sense, the software on this thing will try very, VERY hard to not let you do so.. As if we already had our fill of auto jokes from the LG V10 , this Chinese upstart seems to have added… fuel to the fire. The F1 has jumped into a mesmerising mash of metallic mid-range monsters in 2016. You can count Huawei and Honor at three and four. And we think it’s safe to bet on more. But as the €229 ($250) device is targeted towards Eurasia, we think this phone will. have a hard time competing with just its middling specs and mediocre hybrid build of plastic and metal. Nay, what OPPO is counting on you to find out is just how much of a “Selfie Expert” the F1 is.. So, does the “Expert” teach us a lesson or is it just late to class?. If you put the “camera” in “cameraphone,” be prepared to put in effort to make this thing shine. With the ColorOS skin the company has slathered on also sits its Pure Image 2.0+ camera software that does some mean processing tricks to enhance your shots — though maybe not enhancing your experience.. First off, you’ll notice that the viewfinder is quite spartan. Every option or feature is relegated to a back menu: all the essentials like resolution, shutter sound and geotagging are at least two taps away from the viewfinder; and at the outset, only some of the tricks. are pre-loaded while a good chunk you have to install yourself — though it’s good fortune that that’s only a one-tap process. One neat “function,” as OPPO calls them, is the Ultra HD function. As done on other OPPO and ASUS phones, the F1 aggregates four 13-megapixel shots taken at once to produce a 50-megapixel one. Trouble is, if you’re not the steadiest of people, the benefits of this function are essentially null. Without OIS on the device, what would be enhanced detail becomes extra pixel jumble. And then there’s the extra five or seven seconds of post-processing time. Hey, don’t get us wrong, it works as intended. There’s just a lot of work at hand to get the results as intended. Whether you have time for that is your prerogative.. 50-megapixel samples can be viewed here through this Google Drive link .. Beyond that, there’s HDR (not from multiple exposures, though), GIF creation (up to 50 frames), Super Macro mode, an expert mode (where you can’t adjust shutter speed quicker than 1/4 second before going to “auto…” oh well, at least there’s manual focus) and even a RAW capture function, too. Video effects come down to time lapse and slow-motion capture.. Forget all of that for a moment, though, and let’s go have a look at some untouched artifacts.. The company doesn’t make a big deal out of this unit, but we’ll give it the spin it deserves: it’s a 13-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a single LED flash.. It sounds average and it puts out pretty average product. Color was, at the F1’s best, color: rich, accurate and great. Dynamic range becomes hard to come by, though, with those high-contrast situations. And that puts accuracy and “great” in the crap chute. The phase detect auto-focus was reliable and on-target. 1080p video shooting (set to 720p out of the box, it takes four taps to change that) features a heavy dose of rolling shutter, okay detail and jitters, oh my! We weren’t necessarily demanding OIS at this price point, but being at the higher end of what’s out from the competition, that stabilization could’ve been a differentiator in this game.. Ah, yes, we’ve come to it at last! The selfie camera.. The front panel of any particular phone can get really cramped for space — after all, earpieces, proximity sensors and, oh yes, that giant freaking screen do have their places there — and one of the casualties of that room doom sometimes ends up being the front-facing camera. This goes double for the less-expensive phones. OPPO has decided to bite the bullet and go the other way with the F1 with eight megapixels on a quarter-inch sensor. Again, keeping price in mind, that’s a pretty good deal to call out in promo campaigns.. If you’re not like me and do. take care in your procedure, you can get some crisp selfies. Like the other side’s camera, exposure problems persist and can lead to white skies on what’s actually a clear blue day. But for reals, you’re in it for you. And the camera does well, I’ll give it that. Except when you’re in a low-light joint and you decide to use the screen flash.. It’ll do in the pinchiest of pinches, but if you don’t have to call for reserves, — maybe use your legs to get under a lamp or something — then why should you?. Our full review of the OPPO F1 will be coming soon. That’s enough reason to stick around, right?

Samsung Galaxy S9 arrives today: 5 things to know. The State of 5G: When It's Coming, How Fast It Will Be & The Sci-Fi Future It Will Enable. Samsung unveils its camera-focused Galaxy S9 handsets. A second save slot in Metal Gear Survive costs $10. There are loads and loads of cheap Android smartphones on the market, but only a handful are actually worth buying. We’ve seen Motorola really dominate this segment with their Moto G and Moto E devices over the last few years, and they’ve frequently featured in my recommended smartphone purchases. Oppo is another company that has been impressing users with great handsets on a budget, and today I have the $200 Oppo F1.. The F1 is loaded with a collection of very respectable hardware for the price. Inside is an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 SoC to power a 5.0-inch 720p display, all in a slim metal body. Oppo claims the cameras are the star of the show, particularly the 8-megapixel shooter on the front, alongside the 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4 that protects the display. The battery is a tad small at just 2,500 mAh, but generally the hardware stacks up to similar products on the market.. In general, the design of the Oppo F1 is a bit hit-or-miss. There are some aspects that see it punch above its entry-level weight, and there are other aspects where clear compromises have been made to keep the price low. It also uses a derivative style that will be very familiar to anyone that’s looked at Chinese-made smartphones before.. Oppo claims the F1 uses a “premium metal body” with a “velvety metallic feel” and that’s partially true. The back panel is mostly constructed from a flat metal panel that, at least on my gold model, looks very nice. The matte finish gives the back panel a great texture that’s easy to grip, and the sheen is reminiscent of more expensive handsets.. However, there are some very noticeable parts to the F1’s design that aren’t metal. To the top and bottom of the back panel are two plastic strips, which Oppo has attempted to blend into the metal segment by coloring them gold. This move doesn’t pay off at all, and the difference in color and reflectivity is extremely visible. It’s almost like Oppo wanted to introduce contrast to the design by using a different color for the plastic sections, but poorly chose gold to complement a different gold.. Around the edges Oppo has used what they call a “micro-arc edge” that apparently “encircles the phone in a flowing, continuous band”. Unsurprisingly this isn’t exactly true: there are visible seams in all four corners, though you can’t feel them. It appears as though the edges are made from plastic, and like the back, Oppo wants this plastic to imitate the gold metal seen there. Unfortunately, this leaves the edges feeling cheap, and the smooth coating actually makes the F1 more slippery than if the edges were true metal.. The front of this particular model sees a white bezel surround a centered 5.0-inch display. While the white looks decent, I’m not a big fan as it reflects a ton of light in sunny conditions, which make the display harder to view. Oppo has applied a screen protector to the 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4 out of the box, and although I’m not typically a fan of screen protectors, this one is of a high quality and doesn’t impact the visibility or swooshability of the screen.. Below the display, Oppo has included capacitive navigation buttons. Two mistakes have been made here: the back button occupies the rightmost spot while it really should be on the left; and on the left Oppo has bizarrely opted for a menu button rather than the app switcher button. The menu key has been deprecated for years now, and no OEM shipping an Android 5.0 device or newer should include it. It actually hurts multitasking on this device to have to hold the menu key to switch apps.. Around the edges are no surprises: micro-USB on the bottom, a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top, a tactile power button on the right, and two volume keys on the left. The right side also has a removable tray which is where you can insert a SIM card and microSD card.. The bezels on the Oppo F1 aren’t the slimmest going around, but the handset is easy to hold and the 5-inch display provides a good mix of screen size and usability. The 7.2mm thin body is much slimmer than budget handsets from Motorola and other companies, and although I typically prefer to see bigger batteries than slimmer devices, it certainly makes the F1 a more attractive phone..

Oppo brings an impressive metal body, speedy performance and a capable selfie camera to its latest entry-level smartphone. The trend towards highly-capable budget Android phones in 2015 is set to step up a gear this year, with hardware that would've been considered bleeding edge just a couple of years ago. Case in point: devices like Oppo's new F1, announced today and shown off for the first time in London. We've had the chance to take an early look at the Oppo F1, and we've found a highly impressive piece of hardware — especially considering the €229 (£169) asking price.. A metal body, 720p display and speedy performance combine to form one impressive budget phone.. If you're already acquainted with with Oppo's line of Android phones — primarily sold in Asia — the F1 will be a familiar sight. It's the spitting image of the Oppo R7, the mid-level handset that broke cover in mid-2015. With the F1, the idea is to transform this kind of product into something that costs less than €250, and the result is a handset that feels much classier than its price tag would suggest.. The metal unbody — a sort of rose gold on the models we played with — wraps around the side of the handset, while "2.5D" glass covers the front. You're still dealing with fixed capacitive buttons down below, including the legacy menu button, which continues to feature heavily in Oppo's ColorOS system.. The display beneath that glass is a 720p IPS panel — not as spectacular as the 1080p displays we've seen powering similarly priced devices like the Honor 5X , but the F1's screen looks impressive enough when spread over 5 inches. Powering the whole assembly is a Snapdragon 616 processor — a variation on the Snapdragon 615 we've seen inside a number of mid-rangers over the past year. That's backed up by 3 gigabytes of RAM and 16GB of storage, expandable via microSD. And performance on the whole feels fluid and speedy — we noticed no lag whatsoever in our brief time with the Oppo F1 demo units in London today.. That's due in part to ColorOS, Oppo's highly-customized flavor of Android that favors gradients, elaborate icons and swooping animations. Like Huawei's EMUI, there's quite a bit of iOS influence here, to the point where it might be an entirely unfamiliar experience if you're coming from a Samsung, HTC or Nexus device. Like many Chinese handsets, the F1 is highly-themeable, with additional graphics, skins and wallpapers available to download. Not that you'd notice, but underneath all that ColorOS stuff it's Android 5.1 Lollipop running the show.. Where Oppo's software really shines is in the camera experience. There's a 13-megapixel camera around the back with phase-detection autofocus — the kind favored by more expensive standalone cameras — and an f/2.2 lens. Meanwhile, an 8-megapixel sensor behind an f/2.0 lens lurks around the front, and is capable of producing some impressively crisp selfies, even in in darker conditions. Oppo's camera software is fashioned after Apple's (or Huawei's depending on your perspective), but dig deeper and you'll find more than just a copycat UI — Oppo has pushed the boat out with RAW capture, expert mode for fine manual tuning, and super macro — among a wealth of other options.. We'll have to wait until we've spent more time with the Oppo F1 to draw any firm conclusions, but at first glance this looks to be a powerful, impressive, well-built handset.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL.
