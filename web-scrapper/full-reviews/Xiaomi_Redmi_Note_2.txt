Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Macro mode, Night mode, Scenes, Effects.

The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Octa-core, 2000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Talk time (3G): 11.50 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 6.0 days (144 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 – Design. The latest and greatest phone from the company known as “the Apple of the East”, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 continues the company’s trend of offering impressive specifications at astonishingly low prices. It’s also one of the fastest selling phones of all time, having shifting 1.5 million units in its native China in the space of a fortnight.. Boasting a 5.5-inch full HD screen, 64-bit Octa-core processor and a 13-megapixel camera supplied by Samsung, the Redmi Note 2 gives the best Android phones out there a serious run for their money – and all for around £125. Compared to the iPhone-like Xiaomi Mi4 the Redmi Note 2 is a reserved and plain offering, sharing many similarities with its immediate predecessor, the original Redmi Note. It has a two-part construction, with the main body of the handset clipping into a plastic shell that covers the removable 3060mAh battery, dual Micro SIM card slots and microSD slot.. The front of the phone is entirely black, save for a trio of red capacitive action buttons which cover the usual multi-tasking, home and back Android functions. The back panel – which comes in a range of colours – is fashioned from matte plastic and is equally sparse, offering up the camera lens, LED flash, “Mi” logo and speaker grille.. Around the edges you’ll find the volume and power buttons on the right-hand side and the 3.5mm headphone jack and IR blaster on the top. The charging socket is on the bottom edge, and uses a squared-off MicroUSB-A connection despite the fact that the charging cable itself has the more common MicroUSB-B connector.. At just over 8mm thick and weighing 160g, the Redmi Note 2 is relatively thin and light. The use of plastic gives the phone a less premium feel when compared to the likes of the HTC One M9 and Samsung Galaxy S6.. I noticed that the two-part casing creaks audibly when squeezed, largely because the back panel clips on rather than being permanently secured – this is especially noticeable on the left-hand side of the device. These minor points aside, the Redmi Note 2 is an unassuming yet attractive handset.. The Redmi Note 2 employs a 5.5-inch IPS LCD panel which boasts a full HD resolution of 1920×1080 pixels. That supplies a pixel density of 401 ppi, which basically makes it impossible to discern individual pixels without the aid of a magnification glass.. Detail, colour replication and contrast are all excellent, and while the display isn’t as bright and punchy as the AMOLED panels you find on the likes of Samsung’s handsets – and it’s noticeably harder to view in direct sunlight – it’s still impressive, especially on a phone which costs so little..

It’s powered by a Helio X10 MediaTek MT6795 64-bit octa-core processor – the same one found in HTC’s One M9 – and comes with 2GB of RAM.. Two storage options are available: 32GB on the Redmi Note 2 Prime model, which is the one I reviewed and 16GB on the basic edition. A microSD card slot allows you to expand the phone’s storage. 4G connectivity is included – something that was missing from some versions of Xiaomi’s flagship Mi4 – and the roomy 3060mAh battery is removable, which will be a massive selling point to those of you who have grown tired of the current trend for sealed units and non-serviceable power cells.. An IR blaster situated on the top of the phone can be used in conjunction with an app to control your television set or audio appliance, and the 13-megapixel Samsung-made rear-facing camera takes amazing photos, supports 1080p video recording and boasts a super-fast focus time. One thing that is notably absent is NFC, as Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun feels that it isn’t used enough to warrant inclusion in the company’s phones. He could well have a point, but with Apple, Samsung and Google all pushing their own mobile payment services this year, we’re likely to see a massive spike of interest in this contactless tech and its uses.. It’s a shame that the Redmi Note 2 won’t be along for the ride, but to many buyers it won’t be a major negative. Quick Charging 2.0 – something that was rumoured prior to launch but never confirmed by Xiaomi – is also missing. In terms of software, the Redmi Note 2 is sporting Android 5.0.2 with Xiaomi’s excellent MIUI 7 skin over the top.. While Apple fans may well point and laugh at how incredibly similar MIUI looks to iOS, everything is buttery smooth – something which cannot always be said of Samsung’s TouchWiz UI, even on the powerful Galaxy S6 – and genuine care has been made to ensure it looks great, with attractive icons and slick animations.. A lot of optimisation is going on under the hood, and Xiaomi issues beta updates to the core OS on a weekly basis to ensure a constant drip-feed of bug fixes and new features. Potential problems get fixed faster than they would with other handset makers – with the obvious drawback being that issues can be inadvertently introduced as well.. All in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent with MIUI 7 and reverting back to my traditional day-to-day phone was harder than I expected. One serious drawback to the handset you should be aware of is that, as a Chinese phone intended for Chinese consumers, the standard Redmi Note 2 doesn’t come with English language support out of the box and lacks Google apps.. The unit I reviewed was flashed with a multi-language ROM – which added Google Play Store support – by the retailer iBuyGou before it was shipped out, so make sure you get the same treatment before ordering or you’ll have to learn a new language to use the phone.. One other to is that the use of the skin will delay how fast the Redmi Note 2 can be upgraded to new versions of Android – like the fast approaching final version of Android M. This is likely why it’s doesn’t even have the latest version of Lollipop on it.. Next Performance, Battery, Camera and Conclusion. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

Redmi Note 2: Is It Worth The Upgrade?. 25 November 2015, 8:39 pm EST By Vamien McKalin Tech Times. Xiaomi has recently announced a new smartphone, the Redmi Note 3. This is the company's first ever all-metal phone and also its first smartphone to support a fingerprint scanner. For those who are unaware, the Redmi Note 3 should have been called the Redmi Note 2 Pro, but Xiaomi changed the name because it didn't want to confuse consumers.. It should also be pointed out that the release of the Redmi Note 3 came just three months following the Redmi Note 2, a very odd timing. So the question right now is how do both devices stack up against each other in terms of specifications and design?. The two devices have a lot in common, to be honest. This shouldn't come as a surprise because the Redmi Note 3 should have been called the Redmi Note 2 Pro, so obviously the similarities would be more than just minor.. From what we have seen, both handsets sport a MediaTek's Helio X10 64-bit Octa-core processor and a 5.5-inch display. They also come with same cameras, a 13-megapixel shooter at the back and a 5-megapixel shooter at the front.. Already there are no significant differences, but that changes the moment the build quality is brought into the equation. You see, the Redmi Note 2 has a polycarbonate design while the Redmi Note 3 is fully encased with metal. Furthermore, the Redmi Note 3 supports a fingerprint scanner, a hardware feature not found on the Redmi Note 2.. Interestingly enough, Xiaomi will release two versions of the Redmi Note 3. One with 2 GB of RAM and the other with 3 GB of RAM. The Redmi Note 2 only has a 2 GB variant, but with 16 and 32 GB internal storage variatns, the same with its successor.. Another significant difference we came across these two smartphones is the battery. The Redmi Note 3 has a large 4,000 mAh battery while the Redmi Note 2 can only muster 3,060 mAh. Also, the Redmi Note 3 is 8.65 mm thicker compared to the 8.3 mm thickness of the Redmi Note 2.. As it stands, it is clear the similarities here are vast, and also that Xiaomi shouldn't have named the Redmi Note 3 something else because apart from the metal exterior, there's not much significant difference to the Redmi Note 2.. So, is it worth upgrading? Probably not unless you want a metal design with bigger battery.. Xiaomi , Redmi Note 2 , Redmi Note 3. Â© 2018 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

The Apple of China does it again with the amazing Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 phablet. Amazing screen, powerful hardware, MicroSD card slot, fantastic custom UI. No NFC, creaky case design, no fast charging. Amazing value for money and arguably one of the most accomplished phones to emerge from China in recent times, the Redmi Note 2 is a must for budget buyers. Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 review: Design & Display. Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 review: Software & User Experience. Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 review: Memory, Camera & Battery Life. Cheap and powerful Chinese smartphones are something of a mystery for most western buyers, which is ironic when you consider that so many of the best-known tech brands create their products in that part of the world.. This is slowly but surely changing as companies such as Huawei, ZTE and UMI are gaining solid reputations thanks to their impressive, low-cost mobile offerings, but even these firms are left in the dark by the mighty Xiaomi. A company often described as the Apple of the East, not only because it creates gorgeous products, but because it has a habit of copying a lot of what Apple does.. Thankfully it is breaking out of that bad tradition and its most recent handset - the Redmi Note 2 - is unique, powerful and astonishingly good value, coming in at around £125.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Specs & Hardware Detailed Ahead of LAUNCH. "While we were expecting it to be called the Redmi Note 2 Pro all this while," reports GSM ARENA, "turns out the new Xiaomi smartphone - which is scheduled be unveiled at an event on November 24 in China - will instead be called the Redmi Note 3. This was revealed by Xiaomi itself in a teaser image posted on its official Weibo account. So, we'll see the successor to the Redmi Note 2 smartphone - which was released back in August this year - being made official tomorrow.". Xiaomi President Lin Bin also recently posted a teaser image of the device on his Weibo account, revealing a metal design and fingerprint sensor on the back.. The handset will be powered by MediaTek's MT6795 (Helio X10) chipset, and sport a 5.5-inch (1920 x 1080 pixels) display. Inside you'll get 2GB/16GB and 3GB/32GB memory configurations and feature a 5MP/13MP camera combo. The handset is also rumoured to pack in a GIGANTIC 4,000mAh battery.. KYM has long been BIG fans of Xiaomi. The company is a relative upstart in the world of mobile phones and is only just more senior than OnePlus. But both companies have quickly made a name for themselves in one of the biggest marketplaces in the world -- China. As we move towards 2016/17, however, it is very likely we’ll be seeing A LOT more of brands like Xiaomi and OnePlus here in the UK, as well as the US and Europe.. Why? Simple: money -- both companies will be looking to make more of it in the future and the only way to do that is to expand the regions they operate in. This is great news for anyone outside of China, however, as Xiaomi is pretty much unparalleled in how it prices its phones. You get Nexus 5-beating hardware and specs for just over a £150. Not bad when you consider this is essentially Moto E territory in the UK.. The Redmi Note 2 is pretty basic in terms of appearance, with largely plain front and back. It's made almost entirely from plastic and is pretty thin, which keeps the weight down. The back of the device actually unclips to grant access to the battery, dual micro SIM slots and MicroSD card bay. This is great news for those of you who like carrying a spare battery around with you, but it does compromise the sturdiness of the phone - the left-hand side of our review unit creaks when gripped, something an entirely sealed unit would fix. The phone's vivid 5.5-inch, Full HD IPS screen predictably dominates its front, offering superb viewing angles and incredible clarity. A very thin bezel runs along the left and right sides of the screen, which ensures that it's not too wide to grip properly with a single hand. This is the kind of display you'd expect to find on a top-of-the-line blower, not on a £125 offering.. Contactless payments are big news right now, with Apple Pay already established and both Google and Samsung readying their own challengers. Sadly, the Redmi Note 2 lacks NFC so won't be joining the contactless payment party. Xiaomi's stance is that NFC is rarely used by consumers, and isn't worth including. It's worth keeping this in mind if you're looking to purchase a phone and use this new payment standard.. The Redmi Note 2 is running Android 5.0.1, but under a heavily customised interface made by Xiaomi. Dubbed MIUI, it's now up to version 7 and is arguably one of the most refined Android skins out there. Not only does it boast a gorgeous minimalist design, it's packed with useful features which give it an advantage over stock Android. It's also incredibly optimized, which ensures smooth performance and slick animations.. Furthermore, Xiaomi rolls out updates on a weekly basis which means new features are constantly being introduced, making MIUI feel like one of the most vibrant and active operating systems out there. All of which adds to the already pleasurable user experience, of course.. The Redmi Note 2 is an utter joy to use, with no stuttering or awkward pauses to speak of. You can also change themes or create your own, and the only time we experienced any kind of annoyance was when we tried to assign custom tones to our email and text alerts; it's possible, but it is less straightforward than on stock Android, as Xiaomi forces you to use its own apps to make any changes to audio profiles.. Powered by the Helio X10 MediaTek MT6795 64-bit octa-core chipset - the same hardware which is seen in HTC's One M9+ - the Redmi Note 2 is no slouch when it comes to processing grunt. It handled all of the HD video footage we threw at it and played 3D games without breaking into a sweat. 2GB of RAM helps to keep things nippy; 3GB would have put it on an even footing with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S6, but because the Xiaomi has a lower-resolution screen, that additional 1GB isn't missed. In fact, in everyday use the Redmi Note 2 feels notably smoother and faster than Samsung's more powerful flagship.. The Redmi Note 2 comes with 32GB of internal storage, but you can add to that figure using the phone's MicroSD card slot, a feature many cutting-edge Android handsets omit these days. Taking this into account and the existence of cloud-storage services such as Google Drive and Dropbox it's unlikely that you're ever going to be short of space with this handset.. The phone's rear-facing 13 megapixel camera boasts phase detection auto-focus which means it can grab the shot you want faster than its rivals. The sensor is Samsung-made so the image quality is superb, and effortlessly outranks the shots produced by Google's Nexus 6, which is also much slower to achieve focus. Various custom shooting modes are included, and 1080p video recording is also on offer. The front-facing 5 megapixel camera is good for 720p video, too.. The phone's 3060mAh battery is a roomy beast and allows you to get well over 24 hours of use out of a single charge without too much bother. Because it's user-removeable, you can buy a spare and swap it out if you're away from home for long periods. However, the phone doesn't have fast charging capability, despite what some early reports suggested. It's not a massive loss and unless you're switching from a phone which has the tech, you won't have. The Redmi Note 2 isn't a perfect phone by any means, but it's powerful, reasonably good-looking, has great screen and a fantastic camera - as well as other bonuses such as a MicroSD slot and two SIM slots. Add in a truly brilliant interface in the shape of MIUI 7 and you've got a device which wins you over the moment you pick it up.. However, what's truly stunning is the price - retailers such as ibuygou are shipping the unit to the UK for around £125, which places it in the same price bracket as budget Android blowers with far weaker specifications. The only real complaints are the lack of fast charging and NFC, but these will matter less to entry-level buyers who just want a fast and versatile handset..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 review:. Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 (mint green). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good Xiaomi's Redmi Note 2 may be cheap, but it packs in good performance with a reliable camera and expandable storage.. The Bad The phone is pretty much limited to countries in Asia for now, and there's no indication it will head westward anytime soon. Camera color accuracy is a problem indoors and battery life is good, but not great.. The Bottom Line The Redmi Note 2 is yet another Xiaomi smartphone that delivers good performance at a low price -- but those outside Asia however will have a hard time getting one.. Where can I get this phone? Can I still by the phone if I don't live in Asia? Which 4G networks is the phone compatible with? What are the Redmi Note 2's main features? I like taking photos -- is the Redmi Note 2's camera any good? How does the size compare to other big phones? I'm not familiar with Xiaomi's MIUI; what's good about it?. Xiaomi's latest smartphone, the Redmi Note 2, is the kind of phone you're looking for when you need a big screen and features at a low cost, even if its specs aren't all that exciting. As the last new phone the Chinese smartphone maker is selling outside of China for the rest of the year, this is the budget large screen phone to try especially if you've never heard of Xiaomi before.. Personally, I don't really like displays larger than 5 inches, as they make it a tad uncomfortable to use with one hand, but the 5.5-inch Redmi Note 2 didn't seem too hard to get used to. Perhaps it's because I've been testing out the Apple Watch with the 5.5-inch iPhone 6S Plus, which may have made the transition easier.. Like all Xiaomi phones, the Redmi Note 2 runs a custom version of Android called MIUI, and like most Chinese smartphones it takes a page out of Apple's design handbook and puts all the apps on the home screen by default. Also, Xiaomi likes to keep things lean, so you'll find a lack of irritating bloatware, which is always a plus. The 13-megapixel camera isn't the best, but it will take pretty decent pictures with enough natural light.. The phone retails for a mere $150, which converts to around £100 or AU$210, though if you're getting one from third-party online retailers, expect to pay a slight premium. It's a pretty decent phone, especially if you're looking for a cheap device you can take overseas, and it works well for this thanks to its dual-SIM capabilities.. Xiaomi sells the phone in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. There's no word on whether it will ever be sold in the US, UK or Australia, but based on Xiaomi's pattern, likely not. The company is making inroads in India and Brazil, so if we were to see it land anywhere else, I'd put my money on one of those countries.. Third-party online retailers usually stock Xiaomi products, so there's a good chance you can get one for a slight premium. There are a few caveats to note, firstly, warranty may be limited, and you'll have to make sure you're getting the non-China version if you want the Google Play store preinstalled. do some work yourself to get the apps working on the phone.. Right now, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 supports a range of 4G networks, which includes UK carriers like Three and EE, and should support the LTE networks of Optus, Telstra and Vodafone in Australia. The bad news is that 4G won't work in the US, although 3G will.. Apart from having a 5.5-inch full-HD display, the Note 2 sports a MediaTek Helio X10 octa-core 64-bit processor. It also has 2GB of RAM, which isn't a lot, as well as a mere 16GB of onboard storage, but it does have a microSD card slot if you need more storage. The Redmi Note 2 comes with dual-SIM 4G, which is pretty good if you are traveling overseas and want to use a local SIM card to save on roaming fees, without removing your everyday SIM.. The 13-megapixel rear camera is fine, but not terrific. If you're in the bright outdoors, you'll find that pictures generally turn out sharp with colors that are generally true to life. It struggles a bit indoors under fluorescent lighting, and does have some issues with color accuracy then.. The Note 2's camera locks onto objects pretty quickly thanks to its 0.1s phase detection autofocus, which is another plus and there are a bunch of software enhancements, such as panorama mode for taking wide landscape shots. The front camera isn't too shabby; you'll be able to take good-looking 5-megapixel selfies thanks to the phone's built-in Beautify mode.. A look at Xiaomi Redmi Note 2's camera (pictures). While it has the same screen size as the iPhone 6S Plus (5.5 inches), the Redmi Note 2 is actually smaller in size overall, though it's still slightly thicker than the 6S Plus. Compared against, say, the more expensive. Huawei Mate S , which has a similar-sized display, the Mate S is just a hair smaller, though you'll find both to be around the same size.. MIUI is Xiaomi's take on Android, and if you're switching from iOS, you'll feel right at home. Like iOS, MIUI drops the Android app drawer (where the apps are usually found) in favor of putting all the apps on the home screens. You can easily sort apps into folders, and there's a smart feature that lets you use one digit to drag an app icon while using another one to flip the "page" to get to a new screen. This is way easier than bringing the app to the edge of the display the way you do in Apple's iOS.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

All the three new handsets run MIUI 7 and feature 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) display.. Under the hood, the Redmi Note 2 packs an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 processor (2GHz quad-core Cortex-A53 + 2GHz quad-core Cortex-A53) coupled with 2GB of RAM.

The 4G variants unveiled in China notably support both TDD-LTE Band 40 2300MHz and FDD-LTE Band 3 1800MHz used in India.

Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

The Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 is one of the cheapest phablets you can get and that will most likely put it on your radar sooner or later. It may be a mere blip if you're the kind of person who consciously avoids the extremes. But bargain hunters will probably zoom in for a closer look. And they might actually have a point.. The original Redmi Note sold out in a flash back in 2014, followed by its LTE-enabled version, and the upgrade, Redmi Note 2, is wasting no time either finding a place among the record-breakers. And that's even before it was available in India, which is a traditional Xiaomi stronghold, alongside its home market of China of course.. Xiaomi is certainly eyeing Europe and the US too and, although the company is cautious about an actual timeframe, it's been running a dedicated online store for accessories quite a while now.. There are two distinct types of Notes in the Xiaomi portfolio and things can get a little confusing. The Mi series is the place to get a premium phablet while the Redmi Notes are the budget-friendly alternative. That said, the Redmi Note 2 is certainly cheap but the level of equipment is trying to match the midrange offerings by the established brands.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 upgrades its predecessor in areas where it matters. The Redmi Note 2 packs a higher-res 5.5" IPS display of Full-HD resolution (up from 720p) and is powered by a superior MediaTek Helio X10 chipset with an octa-core processor, Power VR graphics and 2GB of RAM. The main camera unit has been treated to phase detection autofocus, there's a brand new IR port and fast battery charging has been borrowed from the high-end Xiaomi Mi Notes.. So, we're about to review a phone that reached best-seller status in China in record time. It would be insane to expect as big a splash in developed markets but value for money is a traditional Xiaomi weapon. Let's proceed to unboxing and see how well prepared the Redmi Note 2 is to make use of that.. Special thanks to HonorBuy for providing the review unit..

GizChina provided a full spec sheet for the device this week, and reported it will feature a 12-megapixel Sony sensor coupled with another 5-megapixel Samsung unit. Around the front, the phone is purported to offer a 16-megapixel shooter.. Otherwise, GizChina’s report does not mention the processor, though it does say the Redmi Pro 2 could feature 3GB of RAM.

Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 Prime: features, specification and price in India. Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 Prime is successor of fairly successful phablet Xiaomi Redmi Note 4G. The Chinese smartphone manufacturer has already launched this phone in China, however, it is yet to officially arrive in India. Here’s our initial impression of Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 Prime - features and specification. Xiaomi has once again did what it does best, which is manufacturing a value for money phone. The Redmi Note 2 Prime is another phone from Xiaomi which justifies its price tag. The affordable phablet has a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS screen with 401ppi. The screen offers good colours and contrast ratio but is not as bright as Mi4i. In terms of under the hood specification, the phone houses an octa-core 2GHz Cortex-A53 Helio X10 SoC. The same chipset is being used in HTC One E9+, Gionee Elife E8 and Sony Xperia M5. Performance of MediaTek's MT6795 Aka Helio X10 is quite decent and affordable, and that is why more and more brands are considering it for their new phones. A PowerVR G6200 (Rogue) GPU delivers good performance even on 3D games test. Phone manage to handle multiple task at a same time with its 2GB of RAM. Even though it’s not the fastest handset, it is good enough to handle the needs of an average mobile user. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 features quite a handy back and front snapper. The rear camera carries a 13-mega-pixel sensor with phase detection autofocus. A LED flash is placed just under the camera to illuminate surrounding in dull light condition. The camera performance is better than its predecessor. Images captured by this camera lack sharpness. The grain level is quite manageable. What sets it apart from others in the same category is its MIUI7 OS. Even though the MIUI 7 is based on Android Lollipop 5.1, the UI looks completely different, mind you in a better way. Layout of the home screen is almost a copy of Apple’s iOS. The notification drawer in MIUI is customizable. Xiaomi has added number of animations to make it more appealing for users. It draws all energy from its 3,060 mAh battery which is just average as per the prevailing market standards when it comes to phablet phones. In terms of connectivity option, like previous generation it supports 4G LTE. There is quad-band 3G connectivity with HSPA support, dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac support and Wi-Fi Direct. Xiaomi Note 2 Prime best price in India is expected to be Rs. MIUI 7 13-megapixel camera Good chipset Vibrant MIUI7. Screen protection missing No NFC Build quality.
