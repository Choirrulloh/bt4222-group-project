Many people look for a replacement to their old phones, the others want to reward themselves for the success of the past year, and finally, the rest of them want to encourage themselves to stand against hardships 2017 will bring. A for smartphone makers, IDC statistics shows Huawei smartphone shipment reached 33.6 million units in the third quarter making it as the first Chinese smartphone maker. This manufacturer has worked hard to defend this title, and it is going to finish the year with another crazy smartphone dubbed as the Huawei Enjoy 6S .. This is another all-metal smartphone coming our way from Huawei. The key features of the Huawei Enjoy 6S include:. As you see, the Huawei Enjoy 6S can’t be compared with the high-end Huawei Mate 9 / Mate 9 Pro, but it still provides an acceptable performance and comes in a stylish design. However, to understand what a device the 1 st Chinese smartphone brand comes in with let’s dig deeper.. The Huawei Enjoy 6S is considered as a mid-range smartphone costing around 1000 yuan ($144). So many may think we are dealing with a handset with insufficient build quality. Fortunately, it’s not the case, because the Huawei Enjoy 6S sports an all-metal housing that passes several production processes. As a result, any detail on the phone looks like a masterpiece. To ascertain in my words you only have to take a peek at the fingerprint scanner on the back or at the front speaker. A single sight will make you realize you are dealing with a CNC crafting done to make the phone look worthily.. The front panel of the Huawei Enjoy 6S is covered with 2.5D arc glass, while the back shell comes with rounded edges. This make users to feel a perfect grip. Thus the Huawei Enjoy 6S is great in terms of ergonomics. But let’s don’t forget we are reviewing a mid-range smartphone, therefore many design elements will remain standard and familiar from other models. For example, the front panel carries a 5-inch display with a good screen ratio. The top area carries a light sensor, front camera and a speaker. The bottom part only carries a Huawei logo, therefore the phone has been designed symmetrically. Generally, the Huawei Enjoy 6S sports a 720p In-cell display covered with a special coating to reduce fingerprints effectively. The black border around the screen is at the acceptable range.. The top side comes with a 3.5mm audio jack and microphone hole, while the bottom side comes with dual speakers, and a micro USB port located between them. All these holes and ports come with CNC crafting, so when looking at them closely we can notice every detail made perfectly.. The back panel comes with symmetrical design as well. It carries a camera with LED flash, a fingerprint scanner under it and a Huawei Logo on the lower side. The SIM card slot is located on the left side, and the volume rocker along with the unlock button are on the right.. The Huawei Enjoy 6S comes at 143.2×70.4×7.6 mm and weighs 140 grams. There three color options you can choose from – white, gold, and silver.. Huawei Enjoy 6S runs on EMUI 4.1 based on Android 6.0, thus we are dealing with a typical Huawei family smartphone in terms of software.. Moreover, the phone comes with a special F2FS (Flash-Friendly File System) file system that makes users to interact with the device more smoothly than you can think. There is no secret why F2FS provides better user experience but the fact it is more mobile-friendly and more advanced file system rather than the ext4 file system found on many mobile phones and NTFS found on many computers. It is developed by Samsung to use mainly on Linux kernel, therefore Android-powered phones are able to use it. Not digging into the technical aspects I have to say F2FS is very fast when it comes to small files data transfer, and this is the main advantage of this system.. Another advantage of EMUI 4.1 is the various power saving modes. Say, it offers to disconnect the network, stop the background running programs, save memory resources and many more in order to extend battery life.. However, F2FS has a few shortcomings referring to memory usage, and as you can see from the screenshots below, though the phone is packed with a 3GB of RAM and 32GB of ROM, only 1.4GB and 22.36GB are available, respectively.. As the Huawei Enjoy 6S is a budget-friendly device, it’s quite predictable many students will acquire this device. So there is a special student mode allowing parents to restrict some functions of the phone.. That’s not a secret a fingerprint recognition is a standard for smartphones, but most of them are capable of implementing only a few operations such as sliding, capturing and unlocking. This is not true for the Huawei Enjoy 6S, as its fingerprint scanner allows the users to make payments, capture photos and encrypt files and many mores.. As for fingerprint scanner features, it identifies fingerprints very fast and no matter what an angle you put your finger on. I understand that many Chinese smartphone makers say their phones support 360 degrees of recognition and the scanner works very fast, but I also know most of them are true only on paper. This is not the case – the Huawei Enjoy 6S fingerprint scanner actually works very fast.. Though this scanner is capable of doing many operations like unlocking the phone, controlling the camera, alarm clock, and notification bar, encrypting files, and many more, the most attractive functionality is the fingerprint payment.. This handset sports a 5MP front camera and a 13MP rear camera that has become a mainstream for mid-range smartphones. It’s difficult to say the Huawei Enjoy 6S camera is something special, but it provides PDAF (phase-detection auto-focus) using 5P special optical lens, built-Platinum Blue Glass, miscellaneous effectively absorb infrared light, and reduced glare ghosting. Thanks to Samsung sensor with f/2.2 aperture this camera can focus in less than 500ms.. Generally, the camera app is very simple in terms of usage – once it’s launched you can see list of many options such as HDR mode, watermark settings, and even online translation.. The Huawei Enjoy 6S offers 5 resolutions and aspect ratio along with a number of optimization options such as smile face snapshots, extinguished snapshots, tracking capture and so on.. You can also use any of offered filter effects.. No matter what a smartphone you own – a-thousand-yuan handset or a-thousand-dollar device, there is always a requirement for a better and larger battery. Different vendors come in with different optimization options. I mean some manufacturers try to short the charging time offering different fast charging technologies, while the others try to keep the phone alive for a longer time offering different power saving modes. What we have experienced referred to the second case, thus both the hardware and software are combined to extend the battery life on the Huawei Enjoy 6S.. The Huawei Enjoy 6S sports a 3020mAh large capacity battery, and the Snapdragon 435 octa-core processor comes with a special down-conversion technology based on an adaptive adjustment algorithm allowing the phone to switch between different modes in order to provide a lower power consumption not affecting high performance.. In addition, EMUI 4.1 comes with a special technology that can detect high power consumption apps in real-time and optimize their usage by cleaning up all those apps that affect the power consumption the more.. It’s said the Huawei Enjoy 6S is capable of providing up to 1.97 days of life time. We decided to check it out, and after a 24 hours of normal usage including surfing in the net, playing games and more, the phone showed 43% of remaining power. After other 7 hours the battery showed 33% of power. Thus after 31 hours of normal usage we spent almost 67% of the power. Therefore, the overall usage on a single charge will last 1.7 days.. We also tested the battery watching a TV series and after 10.7 sets the phone automatically shut down. Thus the Huawei Enjoy 6S provides up to 7.8 hours of video playback.. We even tested it playing a game. When we started playing King of glory the phone showed 39% of remaining power. After 8 minutes of playing this game, the battery showed 37%.. Moreover, the Huawei Enjoy 6S features a Snapdragon 435 processor paired with a 3GB of RAM, and I have to say this is not as weak as you can think in terms of playing games.. In order to understand how fast the Huawei Enjoy 6S will charge we decided to charge it when there was remaining only 5% of power.. We divided the charging process into several parts – 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and when the phone was completely charged.. After 5 minutes of charging the power increased by 1%.. After 10 minutes of charging it is still 6%.. After charging half an hour it showed 13%.. After 1 hour of charging the power increased by 25%.. After 2 hours it was 62%.. Once the battery was charged by 95% the charging power declined to 3.6W from 7W.. Finally, after 3 hours and 20 minutes the phone was fully charged.. Agree the lack of any fast charging technology can disappoint many customers, but as I said earlier, the manufacturer decided to pay more attention to the power saving rather than fast charging.. It’s clear as day Huawei has launched its mid-range smartphone to fight in the most populous market niche – a thousand yuan market. There are myriads of smartphones trying to find their place under the sun, and as Huawei is the number 1 smartphone brand in China, it’s the company’s responsibility to come in with such an undertaking. Obviously, the Huawei Enjoy 6S yields the latest Huawei Mate 9, but their goals are quite different. On one hand, this phone has a list of shortcomings such as less powerful processor, mid-range cameras and displays. But on the other hand, it provides a long battery life and it is capable of implement the daily tasks. So the Huawei Enjoy 6S is a great option for those who are looking for a mid-range and budget-friendly smartphone.. Sony Xperia XZ2 Hands-on Review : First look.
