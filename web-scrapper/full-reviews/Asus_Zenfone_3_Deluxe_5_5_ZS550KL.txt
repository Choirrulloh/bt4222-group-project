ZenFone 3 Deluxe 5.5" ZS550KL 64GB Smartphone (Unlocked, Glacier Silver) Reviews - page 2 bzzeucxu. ZenFone 3 Deluxe 5.5" ZS550KL 64GB Smartphone (Unlocked, Glacier Silver) is rated. Rated 5 out of. Had the phone for three weeks now and love it. Great performance and nothing to complain about. The fingerprint unlock feature is super fast and convenient. Only complaint is that the metal exterior is hard to hold on to when you have really dry hands. I'll buy a case as soon as there are a few options on the market. Also, there is the standard pile of bloatware from ASUS, but I've gotten over that.. Rated 1 out of. Quality and durability ? I think not. After owning this phone for a week it refused to power on. Was sent in for RMA to ASUS and they replaced the motherboard. In a weeks time, the phone's glass was cracked. It didn't even take a heavy fall. Let's put ASUS in it's place as the company that ONCE WAS. This phone was built for a museum, a shiny, slippery, fragile piece of art that was never built to see any real world use. ASUS wanted over $290 to replace the screen under warranty. You have lost my business and respect. I no longer recommend these products to anyone.. Rated 5 out of. This phone is awesome, easy to customize without downloading any apps, its fast, things look on it fantastic! The speakers are wow, you can listen to music, or tv shows out doors no problem. Battery life is exceptional and the packaging was just gorgeous ! :). Rated 5 out of. I use it for long calls, the signal quality is really good. Also for social media access, taking lots of photos, since I'm a photographer, doing bank services and almost everything you can do nowadays with your phone. The camera works really well in low light, I like the HDR and all the modes, the professional mode is fantastic for the ones who like photography. 4 GB of RAM makes the phone become more faster, specially when changing between apps already open. The battery life make it run easy for 24hs, you just need to take care with the screen bright. The way Asus deals with the apps is amazing, that makes you save lots of battery life and turns your experience with the phone better. I ordered also a screen protector and a case, I recommend you do the same!. Rated 5 out of. It's the perfect choice when trying to get a good point between value/cost. It looks high end, it has a great camera, awesome game performance and beautiful exterior design.. Rated 5 out of. Try To Find One Better At This Price. It has excellent resolution and outstanding phone reception. Compared to anything else in this price range it can't be beat. I've used ASUS computers for years with zero problems and went with the ZenFone 3 Deluxe based on the ASUS reliability I've experienced. So far I am very pleased with this unit. Rated 3 out of. Very satisfied with the product, to which I'd give 5 stars. However, this was the last order in B&H Photo and no longer recommend the online store. Order placed on Apr 15th, paying for a 2-day shipping and expecting, as informed in the confirmation email, to receive the product up to Friday, Apr 21th. My wife had traveled to SLC and would bring the products to me in Brazil. On Apr 20th I got an email informing about the delivery on Apr 23rd, one day after my wife was flying back to Brazil. Once in contact with the guys in B&H, looking for some help to save my order, they said sorry, there is nothing I can do for you. Fortunately we got a help from the local hotel and some friends I received my phone yesterday, May 06th.All these incurred in extra shipping costs. Rated 1 out of. no more Asus phones for me. had zenfone 2 ,broke on warranty - send it out - came back - worked some more and died - guess what , zenfone 3 was working great for couple of months - just yesterday ,died - powers up but then shuts off ,im done.

Asia-chan, 09 Sep 2017 Gallery app didn't support all images and video files so if you want to watch, install somethi... The phone came in a very nice box packaging and looks very premium. When first holding the phone it feels sturdy and nice to look at not to mention it's quite light weight which is a plus for me. But (in my case not sure about anyone else), when you observe the chromed part of the phone when the screen is facing you, you will notice there are small gaps of unchromed areas, in my case 4 small gaps (top side right, left side near top, bottom side right and left mirrored). Not sure if this is intentional. Upon turning on the phone, the interface(ui?) feels smooth and no stuttering can be seen. Instantly updated this phone to Android 7.0 and the performance stays the same with no problems during the upgrade process. The display is a 5.5" 1920x1080(? Forgot &#128523;) is very nice. In a bright open area under the sun the screen is brightness is good enough for me. Can watch YouTube at 1080p 60fps without stuttering because of the hardware that is equipped in the phone. As for the fingerprint scanner which is located at the back of the phone, it is not the fastest out there, but it does it's job. I didn't even need to put my finger on the scanner for a long time. Just a quick tap will unlock the device, do take note when I instant tap the scanner with my finger it takes a few moments to unlock the device. The 16MP camera is very nice but as many others, it suffers in low light situations when it is set on auto not to mention the not so bright camera flash. When capturing a photo you cannot move or else it will be blurry. The front facing 8MP camera is decent, can use it to pick my nose from time to time. I do not really use the camera much as I'm not a camera guy so I can't give any detailed points for it, sorry. The 3000mAh battery life is decent and very situational as I used occasionally watch videos on YouTube and sometimes browse 9Gag from morning to the end of the day, you can expect the battery to be around 30%~ left based at least on my usage. The fast charging is very convenient just plug it in at 20% and let it charge for an hour it is near fully charge. Again, battery life in day to day use is situational. The LTE is a very nice upgrade from my last phone (Samsung J3 2016). On my old phone I can hardly get LTE (I use WEBE/Unifi sim card) at my place (KKTM Kemaman hostel near facing a forest) if I do not move around to search for LTE leaving the confort of my bed. On the new phone I can laze on my bed without leaving it and enjoy the LTE connection. This is also situational to the place you're living. The speaker is a bottom facing type. The audio at max is very loud as it has an "outdoor" option, but sometimes causes the audio to break or have that unclear feeling about it. Would have been nice if it the device is a dual speaker, but got to live with what I pay for. As for the included earphones, the quality is nice and they also include extra ear buds in the earphone box if you somehow to lose the buds. When jamming the earbuds into the ear hole (? Lol) you can barely hear anything outside unless it's loud. When set on highest volume the earphones doesn't really sound so good but in the mid range volume it's decent. When volume is at max the Hissing when a word with letter "S" sound is too high pitched it hurts my eardrums. Hope this helps anyone decide whether this phone is for you or not.. Xiao Ping, 29 May 2017 Hi Everyone!.

Hongmeirin, 30 May 2017 Interesting and good spec for its price but the battery was quite disappointing.. more Lithium Ion Polymer (LiPo) batteries are more expensive to manufacture and offer only slightly higher battery life. So they probably used Lithium Ion instead of LiPo to keep costs down.. jing, 09 May 2017 is this available in the phillippines? yes, it is. Interesting and good spec for its price but the battery was quite disappointing. Previous unit was Li-Po why would they make this one Li-Ion battery?.

My Zenfone 3 Deluxe 5.5 (ZS550KL) can't play video with GALLERY of Asus but for photos work well. is this available in the phillippines?. ZS550KL (Z01FD) does have a am/fm radio, laser for cam and ruler app, and the sound of the earbuds are great until you max the volume. The speaker volume is not the loudest I have heard, but it works just fine. The picture quality is nice, (a little grainy in low light), and the display is very bright and crisp. The processor speed and memory are more than enough to run multiple apps at a time, and the storage can be upgraded, adding a memory card to one of the slots of the dual sim tray. I have upgraded to Android 7.0 N and have yet to have any problems with anything on the phone. I love the fingerprint reader on the back. It works well as long as you make sure to capture your print at the right angles. Sometimes it will take about 2 days for me to drain the battery with moderate use, (movies, hotspot, news, weather, and music).. Anonymous, 13 Mar 2017 What is the exact price of this handset?

Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe (titanium gray). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good All-metal body looks premium; sleek design feels great. Has a whopping 6GB of RAM. The Bad Rear camera can be sluggish in low light. The cluttered user interface and bloatware make it a pain to use.. The Bottom Line The Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe has a luxurious build that's overshadowed by bloatware and poor performance -- you're better off with the OnePlus 3T or a cheaper ZenFone 3.. The Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe could have been one of the greats. Instead, its poor performance makes it downright forgettable, and easily overshadowed by the ZenFone AR announced in January at CES. For the price, you'd be better off with the cheaper ZenFone 3 ( $294.99 at Amazon.com ) , or even the OnePlus 3T , with its cheaper price and similar specs.. On the plus side, it costs $500 or AU$735 unlocked, which works out to be around £450 (it's not yet available in the UK). Part of that reasonable pricing has to do with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor. If you opt for the version with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821 chipset, the cost zooms to $800, which is about £660 or AU$1,085 (this version is not yet available in either the UK or Australia).. Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe sports a premium finish. I love the design of this all-metal, 5.7-inch phone. Asus has done some clever engineering to hide the antenna lines and the result is a clean-looking metal device. The phone's display is bright and vibrant. As for the Deluxe's charging lifespan, I'm pleased to report the embedded 3,000mAh battery is more than sufficient to last you a full day's use and then some. In our video looping tests, the phone lasted 13 hours 55 minutes.. While the diagnostic benchmark scores were pretty good -- thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor -- actual day-to-day performance can be laggy. My best guess is that bloatware (a lot of preloaded apps) uses up precious memory and slows everything down, especially keeping all those apps updated in the background. In addition, I find the keyboard unwieldy. It keeps the settings button where the number switch key is usually located, and also has the worst autocorrect feature I've come across. You're better off downloading and installing Google's keyboard (which I did, after struggling for 2 hours with the Asus keyboard).. The rear 23-megapixel camera does a wonderful job snapping pictures when there's enough light, but low-light situations are a bit hit and miss. The default auto mode keeps the shutter open longer for a brighter image, but if your subjects are constantly moving (like my cat), then all you get is a bright but blurry shot. Check out the test shots gallery below for a more in-depth look at the camera.. Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe camera test shots. The Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe is a great piece of hardware from Asus, but the Taiwanese company needs to figure out how to do software better. The company also needs to figure out how to deliver phones earlier -- it announced the ZenFone 3 in June, and review units trickled out 6 months later. Because of the delay, there are already phones out that are just as good and even better. For our money, we'd go with the OnePlus 3T or even the regular ZenFone 3.. 2.15GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 / 2.4GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821. Dual-SIM, metal chassis with no antenna lines. Laser/phase detection autofocus, OIS (4-axis), fingerprint doubles as shutter button. Notifications toggle, dual-SIM, Dash Charging.

Night shot, low light & back light photos. With light sensitivity that is up to 8x of a typical smartphone camera, the ZenFone 3 Zoom is the ideal smartphone for ultra-clear and vivid night or low light shots and photography of backlit subjects. It has multiple features that give it such good light sensitivity. First it has an ƒ/1.7 aperture is one of the largest found on any smartphone camera. The aperture of any camera is the hole behind the lens through that allows light to reach the sensor. The larger it is, the more light is able to reach the sensor. Next, the ZenFone 3 Zoom has OIS that helps stabilize handheld shots to prevent blurring in very low light photos that need slightly longer shutter speeds to expose. Third, it has a large 1/2.55” sensor that has 1.4µm pixels which are among the largest in the industry. Larger sensors and pixels also contribute to increasing the camera’s light sensitivity. Finally, the ZenFone 3 Zoom uses a powerful image processor known as the SuperPixel™ Engine that enables it to intelligently control the senor’s light sensitivity and multi-framing process to reduce noise artifacts that typically occur in low light shots.. ZenFone 3 Zoom ASUS SuperPixel™ Camera 8x Low Light. Learn more about ASUS SuperPixel™ Camera. ASUS SuperPixel™ Camera — ZenFone 3 Zoom offers greater light sensitivity than other smartphones thanks to its new ASUS SuperPixel™ main camera that allows users to take extremely fast and clear photos in night or low light environments.
