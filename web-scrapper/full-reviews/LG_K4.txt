LG K4 review: Whilst most people are focussed on LG’s latest flagship, the G5, spare a thought for the baby of the bunch, the new entry-level 4G-ready LG K4.. Phone makers like Samsung are upping the ante with regards to design across entire ranges, but the aesthetics of the K4 feel like a throwback to 2012.. The entirety of its body is plastic, with a lightly textured removable back that’s functional, even if it isn’t the prettiest thing in the world. The smooth finish elsewhere, mixed with the heavily rounded edges and corners, not to mention its overall size and weight, make it a. comfortable fit in the hand, with the hardware controls along the phone’s sides naturally resting against your index finger and thumb.. Without a lip to get a fingernail under, the back doesn’t prise off particularly easily, but once removed you have access to the K4’s replaceable battery, microSD slot and microSIM slot. The back is also where you’ll find the loudspeaker grille, which can be obscured if the phone isn’t held appropriately.. Being a low-end device, you can expect a suitably conservative visual experience from the K4, which packs a 4.5-inch WVGA IPS LCD that does the job, but not much else. It produces nice colours and blacks head-on, but whites aren’t particularly punchy or accurate and more extreme viewing angles bring contrast and colour distortion.. You can quickly toggle between low, medium and high-intensity backlight levels to alleviate the lack of automatic brightness, but even at maximum brightness the screen still struggles with external light sources and glare, not helped by the fact that the cover glass is such a fingerprint magnet.. Whilst some of LG’s lineup are already running the latest major release of Android, the K4 launches with version 5.1.1 Lollipop. Despite being a little long in the tooth at this point, it still makes for a robust user experience, here dressed in LG’s own skinned interface, iconography and apps.. You get typical LG experiences, like Knock Code security on the lockscreen, a slew of tools for power and storage management and a theme and customisation experience, but for the most part, it’s much easier to use compared to older interface offerings from the Korean smartphone maker. It’s also worth noting that unlike the new G5, the K4 hasn’t done away with the apps drawer either, making the transition for users coming from other Android phones that little bit easier.. Whilst the middling display highlights the phone’s low-level standing, the capabilities of the K4 feel as if they out-perform the humble silicon powering them. At the heart of this phone is an underclocked 1GHz quad-core Mediatek MT6735M, paired to a gigabyte of RAM, which in practice seemed more than enough to offer up a reliable user experience in day-to-day use – perhaps as a result of the relatively low display resolution. You’ll spend time waiting to open up more robust apps and you’ll notice lag and stutter when performing actions like pulling down the notifications tab, but most of the time, the K4 doesn’t feel like it’s struggling all that much.. Storage is very limited, with almost half of the phone’s 8GBs of total space occupied by ‘miscellaneous’ files, which we presume are predominantly comprised of the operating system and LG’s apps. With that in mind, picking this phone up with a microSD card should be considered a necessity, rather than a choice.. On the upside, such humble specs paired to a fairly sizeable 1940mAh battery give the K4 real staying power. Similarly to the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact, the K4 can last a full weekend without needing to visit a wall socket and as it’s removable, should you run dry, you have the option of carrying a spare to switch it out instantly.. A 5-megapixel primary camera and a 2-megapixel front-facer mean K4 owners won’t get left out in the cold if they want to use their phones with apps like Skype and Snapchat.. The rear camera boasts an LED flash, whilst you can leverage a screen-based flash for selfies in low light using the front-facer, even if picture quality is decidedly weak. The 2-megapixel secondary snapper lacks detail and loads shots up with noise once lighting conditions are anything other than stellar.. Primary camera quality meanwhile isn’t an absolute train wreck. We weren’t surprised by the narrow dynamic range of the K4, which tends to blow out whites and crush blacks in high contrast environments, but in well-lit scenarios it can capture a respectable amount of detail and the LED flash helps to keep the colourful noise at bay in dimmer environments.. You also have usable 720p HD video recording and more advanced features like gesture shot and voice-activated shutter control.. LG has stayed true to its word with the K4, offering an affordable smartphone experience with some standout talents that feel as though they punch above their weight. For £99, you get a compact 4G handset that sports a decent primary camera and a smooth user experience.. We wouldn’t recommend it for media consumption, with its lacklustre display and paltry internal storage, but impressive battery life render this a reliable feature phone replacement for those on a budget.. The biggest barrier for the K4 is that low price however, as handsets like the Motorola Moto E and new Vodafone Smart Prime 7 offer even more phone (4G, a 720p HD display, higher resolution cameras and a partly metal build in the case of the Prime 7) for even less. The LG K4 has its place, but we wouldn’t call it a worthwhile purchase in the long run.. Handset and case provided by MobileFun.co.uk. Casio Edifice EQB-500 Review: In Depth.

Andreas Osthoff ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 05/21/2016. Android ARM Smartphone Touchscreen. LG offers an affordable entry-level smartphone with LTE functionality for 119 Euros (~$133), dubbed K4 LTE. That is, however, its only highlight. The review sample makes a rather outdated impression in all other aspects. Have too many cutbacks been made?.

The K4 is the second handset from LG's new K lineup. We recently tested the K10 and were only moderately impressed. At an RRP of 119 Euros (~$133), our present K4 is the lower-priced model, and it is currently sold for just below 110 Euros (~$123) on the Internet. The configuration fits to an entry-level device: quad-core SoC with lowered clock, 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of storage and a small 4.5-inch screen with a meager resolution of 854x480 pixels. The only obvious highlight is LTE support.. Many manufacturers have very affordable devices, for example Microsoft's Lumia 550 , Doogee's Nova Y100X and even LG's own Bello II. Some mid-range handsets from last year, which are now only marginally more expensive but offer more features and better equipment, might also be interesting. Potential contestants are Motorola's Moto G3 and LG's G4c .. Test device courtesy of notebooksbilliger.de.

As to be expected, LG relies on a plastic casing in black and silver. The rear also features a light texture that slightly improves handling. The smartphone nevertheless looks a bit "old-fashioned". The tightly fitted back cover conceals the removable battery and both slots for the micro-SIM and micro-SD card. The battery does not have to be removed for replacing the SIM card.. The casing's stiffness is satisfactory, which is also owed to the somewhat thicker build (8.9 mm). Although we could provoke cracking noises and wave formation on the screen with pressure, the casing's performance will suffice for routine use. Both physical buttons (power button and volume control) are a bit wobbly. LG also offers a white model as an alternative to our indigo (blue) model.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. Only 2.7 GB is available after updating the preloaded apps. The connectivity of LG's K4 is limited to the minimum. The micro-USB 2.0 port can only be used for charging and connecting to a PC. OTG for connecting USB flash drives or input devices is not supported. A 3.5 mm audio jack is, of course, also present on the lower edge. Bluetooth version 4.1 and Wi-Fi Direct are available for connecting to other devices. An optional headset will be needed for the FM radio.. The internal storage only has a capacity of 8 GB, and only 3.9 GB is available after initial use. However, updating the preloaded apps reduces the capacity to just 2.7 GB. At least the storage can be expanded via a micro-SD card. The manufacturer states a maximum capacity of 32 GB, but the smartphone also identified our 64 GB reference card. Installed apps can be moved to the SD card.. Like the bigger K10 , LG ships the K4 with Android 5.1.1. A software update to the latest Android 6 is presently not available, and the manufacturer has not yet made any statements concerning this. The stock Android user interface has not been modified greatly; only the design has been changed slightly in some points. The usual Google apps and some manufacturer tools known from other models (see screenshot) are preloaded. The folder "Management" is interesting as it allows accessing all important settings, including backup.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

However, the frequency coverage is very low especially in the UMTS network. We did not experience any reception issues at least in the urban T-Mobile network. Wi-Fi connections are limited to the 802.11 b/g/n standards in the 2.4 GHz band. We could easily connect the smartphone with both of our test routers Fritz!Box 7490 and Asus RT-AC56U, and the signal strength was good subjectively. Interruption or even signal losses did not occur during the test.. Strong deviations in the river area. A GPS receiver is also integrated, but its reception was very weak. Although satellites were found inside the apartment, we could not be localized. Surprisingly, that was also the case in our usual place in the garden. We have not yet observed this with another smartphone. However, our bike tour proves that GPS tracking functions. Here, we compare the smartphone with Garmin's Edge 500 bike navigation system. At first glance, everything seems okay; the deviation is approximately 300 meters on our 11 km test route. When looking at the outcomes more closely, problems become apparent as we allegedly rode through water according to the data. The performance should normally be sufficient for use in a car, but better solutions exist for geo-tagging or bike tours.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The phone app's design is very basic and offers a total of five different tabs (dial, call list, contacts, favorites and groups). A link to the notification app is also found in the keypad. The call quality was acceptable; we occasionally noticed quiet background noises that did not affect intelligibility. A hands-free mode is also integrated and functions although the microphone is a bit quiet. Consequently, the handset should not be held too far away from the mouth.. A 2 MP camera is installed in the front. The photos correspondingly lack detail and colors also look very pale. A feature is the so-called selfie cam function. The thumbnail is scaled down and the empty screen area lights up in white to serve as a kind of photo lamp. In contrast to the solutions of other manufacturers, the brightness is not increased and the effect is virtually non-existent. Generally, low-light photos are very dark.. LG incorporates a 5 MP lens alongside auto-focus on the rear. The results are not at all bad in good light conditions, but the photos tend to look darker than those taken with the comparison devices. The sensor also has problems in low light. We observe high image noise that consequently absorbs many details. Videos can be recorded in the HD resolution at maximum (1280x720 pixels, 30 FPS). The lens particularly has problems with fast panning, and image noise also prevails again in low light conditions.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. We also check the color reproduction and sharpness of the photos under defined test conditions. The photos are not edited afterward. LG's K4 does not do a bad job with the colors although the reproduction of some colors is too pale. The camera's relatively low resolution becomes especially evident at the edges of the test chart.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. The smartphone, battery, modular power supply and a USB cable are found in the box of LG's K4 LTE. The customer also finds a quick-start guide and a paper with warranty conditions. The smartphone comes with a warranty period of 24 months; the battery and charger are only covered for 6 months.. Although LG installs a capacitive touchscreen, it can only process two inputs simultaneously. The gliding traits are also only satisfactory. Inputs are often not identified correctly primarily at the edges. The virtual keyboard dubbed "LG Keyboard" can be customized to a very limited degree and does not support all common functions. For example, swiping is not supported, and the keys are also overall very small. Of course, other keyboard layouts can be installed from the Play Store, but the small screen will hardly be suitable for prolonged use. The onscreen Android buttons are also annoying as they further reduce the limited space.. The 4.5-inch screen is based on TN technology and has a resolution of 854x480 pixels. That equals a pixel density of 218 PPI. It is already noticed that the panel is inferior when used for the first time. The maximum brightness of 364 cd/mÂ² is acceptable (APL 50: 343 cd/mÂ²), but the contrast ratio of 766:1 is at the lower end of the comparison field. The screen simply lacks brilliance and sharpness compared with other, good panels. Furthermore, it displays a visible bluish tint. A light sensor is not installed, and thus the brightness always has to be adapted to the surroundings manually.. 341 cd/m² 336 cd/m² 336 cd/m² 338 cd/m² 337 cd/m² 337 cd/m² 340 cd/m² 353 cd/m² 364 cd/m². 92 % Center on Battery: 337. cd/m²) ΔE Color 11.4 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 11 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.19.

This means that the measured response time is similar to the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. Reflections on the screen should definitely be avoided outdoors so that some content remains visible. The brightness would have to be much higher here. A big problem for LG's K4 is the viewing-angle stability of the TN panel. Brightness aberrations and color inversions are very annoying for practical use especially in a smartphone that is clearly moved more often than a laptop.. In contrast to the reference design, the four cores of Mediatek's MT6735 SoC in LG's K4 do not clock at 1.5 but at just 1 GHz. The ARM Mali T720 MP2 takes care of processing graphics. The review sample could normally take a lead on its direct rivals in the benchmarks, but the older mid-range models often have considerably more power.. More power would also be appreciated in routine use. The entire handling is rather sluggish, and that is all the truer with more complex websites or in demanding apps..

The review sample benefits from the screen's low resolution in games. Even the demanding racing game Asphalt 8: Airborne can be played reasonably in medium details, although the loading times are unpleasantly long. More basic games like Doodle Jump are not a problem from the outset. Unfortunately, the rear-sided speaker is easily covered by the hand during games.. LG's K4 does not even get lukewarm during idle or low load. Primarily the upper area gets warm during load. We measured almost 40 Â°C here. That should not be a problem since the smartphone will mostly be held at its lower end. The left hand gets noticeably warmer when gaming in landscape mode. The temperature difference might be somewhat unpleasant. However, that does not involve restrictions.. 39.4 °C 33.3 °C 33.7 °C. 39.9 °C 34 °C 34.4 °C. 40.3 °C 34.4 °C 33.6 °C.

The little rear-sided mono speaker can get really loud with almost 90 dB(A), but it starts to hum at about 50% of the maximum volume. Furthermore, the sound is very treble-heavy as expected. The sound could also muffle on soft surfaces or a table due to its positioning. External speakers or headphones can be connected via Bluetooth or the 3.5 mm jack. Playback via audio jack is low-noise and sufficiently loud with mobile headphones.. No major irregularities were presented in the consumption measurements. Only the idle consumption could be a bit lower. The maximum requirement is 3.25 watts. The included 4.25 watt power supply is sufficiently sized for that..

LG's K4 aims to be an affordable companion, but the handset did not impress us in the test. The smartphone conveys a feel as if it actually emerged in 2012. That is true for the inferior screen, sluggish handling and the equipment. The only highlight is LTE support. We of course know that no miracles can be expected for 119 Euros (~$133), and that the targeted buyer group will unlikely have high demands, but we cannot recommend LG's K4 even then. It is definitely worthwhile to examine price comparisons and invest a bit more money in an affordable mid-range model from last year. The direct rival, Microsoft's Lumia 550, also makes a much better impression with its HD panel.. LG K4 - 2016-05-13 05/13/2016 v5.1 Andreas Osthoff. Read all 1 comments / answer.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Voice activation, Self-timer, Geo tagging. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space..

GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

I bought the lg phone and said it needed a new battery on the first week. Rated 1 out of. Had phone less than a month, installed a few apps and now its so low on space i can't check email. LG has disabled the ability to move apps to the external SD card and some apps can't even store files on it. So, 32 GB of unusable space, thanks LG!. Don't buy this phone unless you want to learn how to root an android.. Rated 2 out of. The camera is the worst on a phone I've had since the early 2000s, and the built in operating system and apps take up 6.3 GB of the 8GB storage, none of which can be moved to SD card or deleted. I needed a replacement phone quickly and didn't want to spend much. The k4 was $130 and isn't terrible. It's easy to use and I'd recommend it to someone who isn't interested in using it for anything other than voice or text, not if they want to install apps beyond Google. Maybe for a child or senior who isn't picky or Tech savvy?. Rated 1 out of. Would not buy if it were the last phone on earth. No battery protection a gentle drop sends the battery flying scratches way too easy speaker not loud enough. Worked good for the first week then got slow. Camera is the only okay thing about it. Rated 4 out of. I've had my phone for a year and I love it ... The only complaint I have was that the fact it is hard to find a case for it and other than that itsvperfect. Rated 4 out of. I have had this phone for only a short while. I love it!! I have had other A ndroid phones but this phone is delightful to use, really inexpensive to own and a credit to LG. With so much junk on the market at this pricepoint I give LG kudos for coming up with a great product and a wonderful value.. Rated 4 out of. I bought this cell lg k4 2 months ago and happy to own it. Rated 5 out of. had it for over a year, reasonable price, excellent battery life.. Download LG product manuals and documentation.

The LG K4 currently has an Informr score of 5.4 out of 10.. This score is based on our evaluation of 9. sources including reviews from users and the web's most trusted critics.. LG's K4 aims to be an affordable companion, but the handset did not impress us in the test. The smartphone conveys a feel as if it actually emerged in 2012. That is true for the inferior screen, sluggish handling and the equipment. The only highlight is LTE support.. LG has stayed true to its word with the K4, offering an affordable smartphone experience with some standout talents that feel as though they punch above their weight. For £99, you get a compact 4G handset that sports a decent primary camera and a smooth user experience.. Compact and well made, but it misses the mark in more ways than one. LG released the K4 on March 7, 2016.. The K4 price will vary depending on retailer, age, special offers and whether or not it's purchased with a service plan.

I had a samsung S4 for two years when it came out and it remains to this day a MUCH, MUCH better phone. It literally blows my mind how bad this phone is. It shouldn't even exist in the year we are in. I would honestly prefer a flip phone. I ended up breaking mine out of pure frustration because, for the first time in my life, the user experience with this phone was so agonizingly bad that it actually made my life harder and less pleasant rather than being a nice cool useful addition to my life like ANY cellphone owes it to itself to be. I would technically rate this phone -10/10. DO NOT BUY!!! It will make your life much, much harder.

LG K4 (officially K121 for Canadian market) is a nice entry-level phone (compact, well-made, and inexpensive), however, it has one annoying software glitch: this phone would not memorize user-specified display brightness and timeout settings, and always reverts back to the default settings, where brightness is 100%, and screen timeout is 2 min. That's right, no matter what display brightness and timeout settings you will set, next time the phone is powered on or restarted, the brightness will be back to 100%, and screen timeout to 2 min!. Device factory reset and software update, which I have tried, did not fix the problem.. I bought another phone of this model (this time from Chat-R, while my first one was from Telus), and guess what? The second device has exactly the same problem!. Strangely enough, the phone memorizes all other custom settings without any problems... Need I say how does it affect the device's battery life, when the screen remains on for whole 2 minutes at 100% brightness after every use?. As you may know, a display is a major battery drainer on today's handheld devices. So if you decide to buy this phone, be prepared to constantly manually re-adjust the display settings to avoid draining your battery in less than a day. We got two of these phones to replace flip phones and are having lots of trouble. The phone will not open up on a random pattern which could put you in a dangerous situation.

We got two of these phones to replace flip phones and are having lots of trouble. The phone will not open up on a random pattern which could put you in a dangerous situation. You can just wait and try again and it might open, or put on charger to give it a shock. This problem seems to happen about the same time with both phones. We have tried all the fixes Verizon gave us but problem persists. When the phones works we like them as our entry level phone.. I love this phone! It was inexpensive, only $120 plus tax. It does everything I need without the expensive price tag.. The camera isn't the best, but it takes decent photos. I have dropped it and it survived. I didn't have to upgrade my contract to get this phone I just switched up my old prepaid for this new smart phone and no extra charges. Wonderful! It does everything my tablet does but better.

Verizon Wireless has officially launched the LG K4 LTE , a smartphone that is heavy on features (as can be expected from a handset belonging to LG ’s K series of devices ) while focusing on bringing a user friendly experience to mobile users. Indeed, with an impressive display screen, sleek aesthetics, and convenient image capturing capabilities, the LG K4 LTE device should be a welcome option for those need a quick smartphone but are not quite ready to spend for a flagship device just yet.. While it is true that we are entering into an era of smartphones with large display screens (the age of phablets, as they say), it is sometimes easy to forget that there still are mobile users who really just want to own a device that fits easily inside their pockets. This is where the LG K4 LTE device comes in. One gets the feeling that LG specifically designed the LG K4 as an all around convenient handset that should come in handy for one handed typing and of course, for selfie shots. And paired with Verizon Wireless’ ultra fast 4G LTE network (ranked as the wireless carrier with the best overall network performance based on a February report published by Root Metrics), plus support for HD voice calls to other HD voice enabled handsets (which produces phone call conversations with significantly enhanced reception and quality), and you got yourself one heck of a device.. The LG K4 LTE device comes with a 4.5 inch display screen with 854 by 480 pixel resolution, flanked by a 5 megapixel camera on the rear side and a 2 megapixel camera (with a Gesture Shot feature, more on that later) on the front side. Inside the device’s compact build is a 1.1 GigaHertz four core chip set that is further supported with 1.5 gigabytes of random access memory (RAM) and 16 gigabytes of onboard memory. The LG K4 LTE smartphone is also equipped with a 1,940 mAh battery that is removable, and is powered by Google’s Android 5.1.1 Lollipop mobile operating system.. As for the features, the LG K4 LTE handset includes Easy Home, which is an easy to use home screen option that basically allows first time smartphone owners to get acquainted more quickly with the device’s interface and functionalities. The handset’s camera features also include Selfie Flash and Gesture Shot. Selfie Flash should come in handy for those who want to take selfies even low light conditions. As for Gesture Shot, it is a feature that allow mobile users to take a selfie just by aligning their palm with the green box on the display screen, and then form a fist in order to activate the three second timer.. The LG K4 LTE is made available on Verizon device payment for $5 a month for a period of 24 months. For more Verizon deals, feel free to browse phones and plans from Verizon Wireless at Wirefly now.
