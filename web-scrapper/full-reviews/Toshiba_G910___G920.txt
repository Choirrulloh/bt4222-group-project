Toshiba Portege G910 & Portege G920 smartphones outed. Posted By Stasys Bielinis on Dec 16, 2007 | 1 comment. Toshiba is not that a big player in the cellphone/smartphone business. Still their G900 & G500 Windows mobile handsets are good smartphone sliders with lots of interesting features. And soon they will have one more cool handset to offer.. It’s Toshiba Portege G910 & Portege G920 flip smartphones, that turned up on FCC site late Friday .. There’s pretty limited information available about Toshiba G910 & G920 models for now. And from what can be seen, it looks like both of them are theÂ. same handset with the same specs.. As you can see from the pictures Toshiba G920 & 910 are made in flip phone form factor similar to Nokia E90 Communicator .. Known Portege G920 &G910 specs will include GSM 900/1800/1900, WCDMA, Bluetooth, WLAN , USB 2.0 connectivity, main camera (at least 2 mpx) with flash, front camera for video calls, 3″ display, 1320 mAh Li-ion battery, microSD memory card slot.. seems to indicate some touch functionality, so the touchscreen is also not ruled out. There also be some click wheel navigation, call answering buttons and small display for caller id on the front of G920/G910 handset.. While I like to play with the latest gadgets, I am even more interested in broad technology trends. With mobile now taking over the world - following the latest technology news, looking for insights, sharing and discussing them with passionate audience - it's hard to imagine a better place for me to be.

Although there's only one difference between them. Toshiba G910 and G920 Are Different Devices After All. Toshiba recently unveiled its new Portege handsets, G910/G920 and G710, after various rumors and leaked information were spread by websites focused on mobile-related news. While the details about Toshiba G710 were and still are clear, no one was sure if the G910 and G920 are two different handsets.. A few days ago I assumed the G920 and G910 names hide the same device and its naming will depend on the market it's launched for. I was only half right, as it turns out that the Japanese manufacturer made two version of the phone that differ in only one aspect: Toshiba Portege G920 packs Qualcomm's gpsOneXTRA Assistance technology and Toshiba Portege G920 brings A-GPS. Aside from that, the handsets are identical and come in the same clamshell form, at the same dimensions (117 x 64 x 19,8 mm and 183 grams).. The full specs for Toshiba G910 / G920 reveal a powerful mobile device that combines business functionality with multimedia features. The handset offers tri-band GSM connection (900/1800/1900 MHz) as well as 3G (UMTS 2100), EDGE, GPRS Class 10 and HSDPA. Its laptop-like design hides a big, 3 inch touchscreen TFT display with a 480 x 800 pixel resolution, a 2 Megapixel camera and a full QWERTY keypad. The phone runs on Windows Mobile 6 Professional and comes with lots of useful features like biometric fingerprint scanner for security, Media Player, Bluetooth, VoIP, Java (MIDP 2.0 and JSR179), Mobile Outlook and ActiveSync. The battery that powers Toshiba G910 and G920 is able to provide 6 hours of talk-time and up to 460 hours of stand-by time.. Both Toshiba G910 and Toshiba G920 will be available starting April 2008 at a retail price of about 600 Euros - somewhere around $880. Until then, let's hope the handsets will be presented at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona (11- 14 February 2008).. # Toshiba # Portege # G910 # G920.
