The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

Just when the Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro arrives in the Philippines packing 6GB RAM and 64GB ROM, a new variant of the device was recently spotted on the Chinese certification site TENAA having a huge 128GB native storage.. The Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro was first announced back in October last year packing a whopping 6GB RAM and 64GB of internal memory storage. About six months after the launch, a new variant of the Galaxy C9 Pro is now known to the public, thanks to the TENAA certification site listing. The new model has the same specifications with the original one, except for its native storage capacity and model number. The new variant, SM-C9008 is said to pack double of the initial amount of internal memory storage, from 64GB to 128GB. In this regard, the Galaxy C9 Pro will be the first-ever midrange phone from Samsung that boasts a flagship level memory configuration.. As what was aforementioned, the phone will retain all its other specs. It will still sport a 6.0-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. It is powered by the same 1.4GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 octa-core processor coupled with an Adreno 510 GPU. It packs a huge 6GB RAM which is suitable for the upgraded internal memory capacity of the Galaxy C9 Pro. Going to the optics, it features a 16-megapixel primary camera with an aperture of f/1.9, a phase detection autofocus, and a dual LED flash. Up front, it comes with a 16-megapixel sensor with the same aperture. It runs an Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow OS and is fueled by a massive 4000mAh battery.. The device originally has three color options, namely gold, pink gold, and black. However, the TENAA listing mentions only two variants, gold and black. As of now, there's no information yet regarding the release date of this new model and what price tag it will be carrying.. Read more news on this product. Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro: A Rare High-Value Offering from the Koreans. Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro: Philippine Market Forecast:. A high-end device which is scores high on the value-for-features ratio as well – Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro. It's amply large, glamorous outside and deceptively powerful inside. Add to that a competitive price. Every Samsung device that hits the market notches up quite a few sales in whatever the price tag might be. This is the simply advantage of having high brand value. It's worth saying that they've rarely let their buyers other than a few bust-ups. But that's just one case – one instance. But this new Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro has a nice little surprise up its sleeve. This is a Samsung device which is in essence high on value-for-features and not just features, and it's worth a proper look inside.. This is as compact and typically metallic a design as it can get. Sticking to the basics is what matters and Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro scores high on minimalism. Few design structures can be sleeker than an Unibody one. This device does that while maintaining a wafer-thin 6.9mm on the sides. A 2.5D Gorilla Glass up top does whatever chic is left to do after metal dual-tone bordering and ever-so-slightly curving matte rear end.. It weighs in just about handsomely at 189 grams, no more no less, perfect for its size. The trademark top-bottom antenna lines behind finish up a completely beautiful, glamorous look.. Coming to the display, there's nothing much to talk about this display as it's just as excellent as all their other AMOLEDs. But this one's bigger at 6-inches. Sporting FHD resolutions of 1920 x 1080 pixels, the 367 PPI does justice to it. And it's quite large in comparison to the body (75.5%). In short, this is as beautiful display as a buyer can come across and definitely among the best in this price range.. First things first, Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro has a 6 GB RAM. And if this is not enough for buyer to simply go for this device then its processor setup surely will seal the deal.. Inside, a Qualcomm MSM8976 Snapdragon 653 series chipset uses an Octa-core packing a Quad-Core Cortex-A72 and another Quad-Core Cortex-A53. Clock Speeds come in at 1.95 GHz, but this setup scores more than impressively in multi-core setups. An Adreno 510 GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) adds to this setup.. In simple terms, buyers will not be left wanting for anything on its 1080p display. Seamless graphics and utilities come with a guarantee – a complete money's worth. Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow runs this device and Samsung are most likely to add a Nougat update into this device quite soon too.. Both the rear and front cameras are 16 MP with the same f/1.9 aperture. The primary rear one comes with a PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus) and a Dual-LED flash. Images are brilliantly vivid with minimal noise and rich depth of field. This setup shines best in low-light conditions with above average brightness capture. Videography is simple and ecstatic leveling out consistently at 1080p@30 fps.. The front selfie 16 MP camera rates as one of the better ones around as per experts. A wide-angle lens allows larger frames. A mentionable pointer is the vivid color depth and sharp hue concentration.. Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro comes with a single internal storage configuration of 64 GB. Extendable external storage comes in at 256 GB via a stand-alone Micro SD slot.. This device draws power from a 4000 mAh battery. Run-times come in at around 14 hours of 3G, 18 hours Video playback and around 7 hours of complete usage.. Philippines have come up ads one of the more important markets for mobile devices and too vital a market in the booming South-East Asian region to loose. Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro is simply to make sure this doesn't happen. It strikes all the boxes and has competitive price tag – a winner on the cards.. Reviews of Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro.

Jamshed Avari , 18 March 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro has been priced at Rs. It has 6GB of RAM, 16-megapixel front and rear cameras, and a metal body. The 6-inch screen has a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels. Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro look and feel Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro display and. specifications Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro software Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro camera performance Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro performance. Samsung's smartphone lineup has a lot of overlaps and there are confusing similarities between models, especially since older ones continue to be sold alongside newer ones. The Korean giant has also recycled its basic template over and over again, and even with a move to metal bodies over the past year or so, most of its phones look just like one another. With its nimble Chinese competitors releasing new models every few months and shoving more features and better specifications into devices across the price spectrum, it has been hard for Samsung to keep up.. However, the new Galaxy C9 Pro is a direct shot against all the upstarts nipping at its heels. It's the biggest departure we've seen from this company. in ages, in terms of styling as well as strategy. It capitalises on the premium Samsung brand in a price segment that people look at when they want a polished, capable device, and it is designed around exactly the features and specifications that people want right now.. While the low-cost segment gets a lot of attention, there are some fierce competitors at and around the Galaxy C9 Pro's level, including the OnePlus 3T. ( Review ), Moto Z. ( Review ), Huawei P9. ( Review ), and Sony Xperia XZ. However, the excellent Galaxy S7. ( Review ) sells for only slightly more, and. with the Galaxy S8 right around the corner ,. should fall in price very soon. We're curious to see how Samsung intends to take on its competitors as well as itself.. Gone are the metal rims and shiny accents around the home button and earpiece that have defined Samsung's phones for years now. Gone too is the usual glass rear panel. The black review unit we received looked almost stealthy, with a matte-finished metal shell and slick glass front. The metal wraps around the sides of the device, and the glass has subtly rounded edges - this is a look we've seen on many phones before, but Samsung manages to make it seem like its own.. The most surprising new touch is that Samsung has gone with striped antenna lines on the top and bottom of the phone. We get a distinct HTC vibe, especially because of the vertical cut going down from the upper band to the camera lens. While these lines look like grooves, they're thankfully flush with the rear. The camera lens does protrude a tiny bit, but it's nearly unnoticeable. It's worth noting that this phone doesn't have a water and dust protection rating.. There's still a physical Home button with an integrated fingerprint sensor below the screen, with capacitive buttons on either side of it. There are volume buttons on the left and a power button on the right. Also on the right edge are two separate trays; one for dual Nano-SIMs, and one for a microSD card. On the bottom, you'll find a USB Type-C port with a standard 3.5mm audio socket to one side and a tiny speaker cutout on the other.. The Galaxy C9 Pro is quite hefty at 190g, and you'll definitely feel its weight in a pocket and in your hand. The 6-inch screen necessitates a tall, wide body, but it's only a few millimetres bigger than an iPhone 7 Plus in both dimensions, and is in fact quite a bit thinner at 6.9mm. The matte texture does a lot to make this phone easy enough to hold - one-handed use isn't impossible at all, but we would not attempt it when walking or being jostled around in a bus.. Surprisingly, this phone is available only in black and gold. We liked the look of our black unit, but from what we've seen, the gold version. We also noticed lots of smudges and smears on the metal after a few days of use. There definitely is a market for phones with really big screens , and this is one of the most manageable 6-inch smartphones we've seen.. The star of the show here is undoubtedly the 6-inch Super Amoled screen. The Galaxy C9 Pro might be larger than Samsung's Galaxy S and Note models, but it isn't quite at that flagship level, so the screen has a full-HD panel rather than 2560x1440. However, 1080p should be good enough for most people, and we had no issues with clarity or sharpness. Viewing angles are good and colours aren't too saturated.. The SoC is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 653, which has four Cortex-A72 cores running at 1.95GHz and four more Cortex-A53 cores running at 1.44GHz, and integrated Adreno 510 graphics. One of this phone's headline features is that it has 6GB of RAM, which might be overkill but definitely looks good to prospective buyers.. You get 64GB of built-in storage and microSD card compatibility goes up to 256GB, so you really shouldn't be worried about running out of space. The Galaxy C9 Pro also supports dual-band Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth 4.2, LTE, VoLTE, and GPS. Samsung is late to the USB Type-C party, but at least the company is on board now. We're also grateful for the presence of a 3.5mm audio port.. The Galaxy C9 Pro's body is large enough for a 4000mAh battery, and quick charging is supported with a compatible charger. The front and rear cameras both have 16-megapixel sensors and f/1.9 aperture lenses, and there's a dual-tone LED flash on the rear.. One disappointment is that this phone runs Android 6.0.1, not Nougat. While we expect that there will be an update considering this phone's premium positioning, we don't know when that might happen. Samsung's UI is pretty simple and certainly more polished than what we see from smaller companies. Everything is where you'd expect to find it.. To the left of the first home screen is a news feed called Briefing, which is powered by Flipboard and looks a lot like it. You can choose your preferred topics and sources, or disable it if you don't like it. There are loads of toggles in the pull-down quick settings panel, but for some reason long-pressing any of them takes you to a customisation screen rather than pulling up detailed settings for that particular control. You can run two apps in split-screen mode, but not all are supported. Like with all Samsung phones, you can choose from a variety of fonts for the UI, but now there's also a store that lets you download even more free and paid ones.. The Galaxy C9 Pro features an always-on display mode, just like the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. You can see the time in one or two time zones, a calendar, as well as the battery level and icons for missed notifications. Unlike the monochrome power-saving modes on other phones, you can choose colours and even background patterns. When the phone is in standby, the backlight goes off but you can still see this information on screen. However, in our experience, the backlight would suddenly come on at random times, even if the phone was lying undisturbed. That was very distracting, especially at night. The always-on display can obviously be disabled.. The Settings app has handy shortcuts that help you find related settings in other subsections. In here, you'll find additional features that Samsung has thrown in, such as a blue light filter with a schedule, an easy mode, a game mode which disables the capacitive touch keys and suppresses notifications, assorted gesture shortcuts, power saving and storage cleanup tools, and even a shortcut to an online user manual.. You get the usual Google apps plus the Microsoft Office collection and a bunch of utilities from Samsung. Secure Folder lets you lock data and apps behind a fingerprint - you can even use it to run a second, secret instance of apps such as Whatsapp. S Secure also lets you lock and hide apps, which seems redundant. S Health tracks your movements and sleep, and set activity goals - of course it works better with a Samsung wearable. Samsung Members offers a confusing mix of company news, a community forum, hardware diagnostic tools, and service-related options. There's also Samsung Themes, Samsung Notes, a USB-OTG data backup app, and Opera Max in addition to Chrome and Samsung's own branded browser.. With 16-megapixel sensors at the back as well as at the front, it's clear that Samsung is trying to impress buyers. The camera app has a very clean layout, and you can double-press the home button to launch it at any point. The Pro mode lets you adjust metering in addition to exposure, ISO, and white balance. There's a button for video recording so you don't have to switch to another mode first.. You can swipe right to choose from one of eight filters, but what's more interesting is that you can download more filters and effects including ones from third-party apps such as Line and Candy Camera. Most of these are free as of now, but there are some that cost over Rs 100.. The quality of the Galaxy C9 Pro's rear camera really is brilliant. It's quick to lock focus and there's no shutter lag to speak of. Photos look sharp and rich, with fine detailing even when seen at their actual size. The large screen makes framing very easy, and we were able to achieve some great depth-of-field effects. Noise was manageable in shots taken at night as long as there was at least some ambient lighting, and colours were also maintained well.. Video was also impressive both in the daytime and at night. The ability to record in 4K would have made this phone more useful for lots of people, so it's a curious omission. We also liked what we saw from the phone's front camera. There are voice triggers since it's really difficult to hold a phone this bulky at arm's length and reach the shutter button.. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro camera samples.. It shouldn't come as any surprise that the Galaxy C9 Pro performed extremely well no matter what we threw at it. We got used to its size, though the weight and balance never really felt natural. This phone was less awkward to use for voice calls than many other 6-inch models we've used. The screen was consistently great for watching videos and playing games on, and the full-HD resolution presents absolutely zero real-world problems. Colours looked fine even under harsh sunlight, and viewing angles were also good.. It might not be obvious at first, but the earpiece doubles up as a second loudspeaker in an attempt to deliver a stereo sound effect. However the two speakers don't converge, and the earpiece is noticeably softer, tinnier, and more muffled than the normal speaker on the bottom. This creates a very off-balance experience - not everyone will notice it, but if you do, it's impossible to ignore. That aside, the sound is pretty thin and shrill, and the bundled earphones are only a little better.. We got 84,596 in AnTuTu, 3,997 in Geekbench's multi-core test, 10,233 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme and 36fps in GFXBench's T-rex test. Everything was snappy and responsive, and even heavy apps and games loaded quickly. The only odd occurrence was that the Basemark Web benchmark kept crashing - even low-end phones can usually get through it, even if they score poorly.. The 4000mAh battery powered through a day and a half of heavy usage, with the always-on screen active and plenty of LTE and Wi-Fi streaming. Our HD video loop test lasted 12 hours, 56 minutes which is a pretty good result, but again not quite in the same league as flagship phones.. Verdict Although Samsung is still the biggest smartphone company in India by market share , it has proven to be less agile than the multitude of Chinese companies which have entered India over the past few years. Xiaomi , Lenovo , Oppo , Vivo and others release new models every six months or so, and with each cycle, better hardware is squeezed into tighter budgets.. We get the distinct feeling that this is exactly what Samsung is trying to fix with the release of the Galaxy C9 Pro. With a big screen, big battery, high-end cameras and 6GB of RAM, the Galaxy C9 Pro hits a number of obvious targets, and will appeal to a lot of people for a lot of different reasons.. While great on its own, this phone isn't quite as powerful as the OnePlus 3T. The Moto Z is also more powerful, and Samsung isn't even trying to compete with the whole Moto Mods ecosystem. As good a phone as the Galaxy C9 Pro is, Samsung is really banking on brand power and buzz-worthy specifications here.. It's also worth noting that the C9 Pro is positioned only slightly below the Galaxy S7. Last year's flagship is superior in terms of style, performance, camera quality, battery life and ruggedness, which all seem like good enough reasons for us to recommend spending an extra Rs. Of course, if you can wait a month or so, we'll see how Samsung adjusts the prices of both these models once the Galaxy S8 is announced..

Pre-ordered it on the 19th and today's the 22nd, received it in good condition. The performance is great, battery is perfect and it's smooth.

I received the phone today and am totally in love with this one.. faster, super slim, light weight, amazing picture quality.. Good camera, good battery, awesome look and performance.

Colour: Gold | Style: Without Offer | Verified Purchase. Timely delivered exchanged my old note 4 with this one which was horrible mobile in all Samsung phones I used. Reviewing this after using for 7 months. Music quality - good Headphone - good Camera - bad even after update to android 7 Overall performance is good 6gb ram is massive & more than what you need Online gaming like Kritika & others with high end graphics is excellent. Excellent screen obviously Samsung Amoled FHD Phone sync is fast so for office purpose it's a good one with all apps of Microsoft words, excel etc. NFC connectivity is very easy n frequently connected as compared to old Samsung phones & other brands too. Mobile heats while using screen mirror option or connecting to smart tv for gaming or charging while using mobile wifi hotspot. Other than that no heating issues. Battery backup is awesome lasts up to 2 days in normal use. Or A day if you play online games for 6-8 hours a day. Very slim & easy to keep no slipping from hands even after metal body nice grip. Stereo speakers gives excellent sound quality even without headphone phone alone is sufficient no need of Bluetooth speaker. Overall performance is excellent using mobile is very smooth & quick. Well it's Samsung so obviously mobile don't hang or such issues. Compared to new one plus 5 & 5t 6gb version C9 is better For 8gb ram version it's not above it but performance is good. But in both cases camera quality of one plus 5, 5T 6/8GB ram is far better. In other way C9 is much better mobile. Only problem is no proper screen guard is available anywhere in market or online. Not even on Samsung store But some expensive option around rs 600 are available for screen guard which are ok. Earlier I was using 64GB memory card now 128GB no issue at all phone works smooth. Excellent feature like app lock, dual apps, multi window is available. Front 16mp camera has retina flash so good pics can be taken in low light.. Was this review helpful to you?.

Colour: Gold | Style: Without Offer | Verified Purchase. Timely delivered exchanged my old note 4 with this one which was horrible mobile in all Samsung phones I used. Reviewing this after using for 7 months. Music quality - good Headphone - good Camera - bad even after update to android 7 Overall performance is good 6gb ram is massive & more than what you need Online gaming like Kritika & others with high end graphics is excellent. Excellent screen obviously Samsung Amoled FHD Phone sync is fast so for office purpose it's a good one with all apps of Microsoft words, excel etc. NFC connectivity is very easy n frequently connected as compared to old Samsung phones & other brands too. Mobile heats while using screen mirror option or connecting to smart tv for gaming or charging while using mobile wifi hotspot. Other than that no heating issues. Battery backup is awesome lasts up to 2 days in normal use. Or A day if you play online games for 6-8 hours a day. Very slim & easy to keep no slipping from hands even after metal body nice grip. Stereo speakers gives excellent sound quality even without headphone phone alone is sufficient no need of Bluetooth speaker. Overall performance is excellent using mobile is very smooth & quick. Well it's Samsung so obviously mobile don't hang or such issues. Compared to new one plus 5 & 5t 6gb version C9 is better For 8gb ram version it's not above it but performance is good. But in both cases camera quality of one plus 5, 5T 6/8GB ram is far better. In other way C9 is much better mobile. Only problem is no proper screen guard is available anywhere in market or online. Not even on Samsung store But some expensive option around rs 600 are available for screen guard which are ok. Earlier I was using 64GB memory card now 128GB no issue at all phone works smooth. Excellent feature like app lock, dual apps, multi window is available. Front 16mp camera has retina flash so good pics can be taken in low light.. Was this review helpful to you?.

Excellent phone with most features that you can find today.. * Super-Amoled is excellent *Camera quality is good. *Processor is probably not the latest one available in the market, but for normal usage and the apps of today doesn't need anything more.. * For this cost, and latest features, 128 GB should have been offered. It could have been a game changer. Was this review helpful? 3 0. By Hrishita Goyal on August 30, 2017 | Verified Owner. Great phone, worth spending that much amount..

Fingerprint scanner is an active scanner means you do not have to press any button before scanning your fingerprint. 6" display with 368 ppi produces excellent contrast and inky blacks, display is also legitimately bright for an AMOLED display. You should have no issue using this phone even in bright sunlight. Color reproduction and viewing angles are great too. Snapdragon 653 processor coupled with 6GB RAM and 64 GB storage. In daily scenarios phone breezes through all tasks threw at it. Let it be gaming or opening multiple apps. There are no heating issues with this device. RAM management is also top notch.. The device is too big for one hand usage and people with small hands will definitely have to juggle the phone everyday. Fingerprint is not as fast as its competitors.. Was this review helpful? 2 0.

Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro is currently available at the best price of: ₹29,498. As the leader of the smartphone market, Samsung’s phones are often put under much more scrutiny than any other. The company has had to deal with many questions. A few years ago it was design, and questions about Touchwiz continue despite the fact that Samsung has made it better. While none of those questions are unwarranted, no one denies that Samsung has persevered.. The most recent questions about the Note 7 fiasco, though may be Samsung’s toughest challenge to date. But if the Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro is a sign of things to come, I daresay Samsung is coming back with a bang. The Galaxy C9 Pro review is important in more ways than one, to both Samsung and the consumer.. Ironically, the Galaxy C9 Pro takes on a segment that Samsung has spearheaded over the years - that of phablets. The original Galaxy Note pretty much kickstarted the phablet market and though 5.5 and 5.7 inch don’t really qualify for phablets anymore, 6 inch does. The C9 Pro wants to be the phablet to buy, much like the Note originally was.. At 6.9 mm, it is really slim and the metallic back feels more premium than what you find on Xiaomi’s devices. More importantly, the Galaxy C9 Pro doesn’t feel like a “big phone” when you first hold it. Its slim profile and the slight curves near the edges make for a decent and comfortable grip. Samsung has also made it much narrower than the Mi Max ( review ) and Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra ( review ), making this the most ergonomic of all phablets in the market right now.. That's not the only ergonomic advantage this phone has. At 189 grams, the Galaxy C9 Pro doesn’t particularly qualify as light, but it is light as far aa big phones are concerned.. All this combined with thinner than usual bezels, very slight chamfers on the edges and a square 16MP camera module on the back, give the C9 Pro a unique profile. Personally, I do enjoy the looks as well, but you may differ on that.. To be completely honest, at Rs. 36,900 I do want a QHD display on my phablet. However, Samsung went with 1080p resolution on this 6 inch panel. That gives the display a 367ppi pixel density, which is just about sharp enough. However, I do wonder whether the added pixels on a QHD display would have made things even better.. They said, Samsung redeems itself once again with colours and premiumness. The display feels smooth when it's used, touch latency is perfect and there aren’t any ghost touches. That, combined with punchy and pleasantly oversaturated colours already makes for the best phablet display right now.. However, where you truly feel that this is a higher quality display are the viewing angles. I've noticed sub-par viewing angles on both the Mi Max and Zenfone 3 Ultra before this, but the Galaxy C9 Pro is truly what it should be. Another stark difference is in how bright this display is, with a maximum luminance of 700 Lux.. To its credit, Samsung has also improved Android’s auto-brightness performance. On most Android phones, the brightness drops and rises in distinct and noticeable steps. That makes for a sub-par experience. While the C9 Pro is nowhere close to the iPhone’s smoothness, you notice the brightness change gradually, making it less distracting. The Galaxy C9 Pro is also faster than usual at recognising and reacting to changing ambient light conditions.. To out in a quick work about the UI, Samsung has put in Microsoft’s apps and Opera Max, all of which can be disabled but not deleted. It's unfortunate, but they don't really get in the way.. The Settings screen now has lesser options, that makes it difficult to navigate. However, Samsung has smartly out suggestions within settings, which direct you where you need to go. There’s also a Search option within settings.. Other than that, Touchwiz remains the same and has an app drawer that many may like. You also get the “scroll screenshot” feature that we’ve seen on the Galaxy Note series before. This allows you to take longer screenshots, beyond what’s on the screen. That, and the Always On display are carried over from Samsung’s flagships. A new addition is the Device Maintenance option in Settings, which cleans up system memory, temp files etc. It's build into the UI, so it operates quite smoothly, too.. The only disappointing bit about the UX is the slow and imperfect fingerprint sensor on the front. It only worked 70% of the times, which was kind of disappointing and when it does work, the transition is only just about fast enough. On a total of 64GB storage space, you get 38.6GB of usable space on the Galaxy C9 Pro.. Most contradictions of Samsung’s phones today are underscored by its penchant for lower specs at higher prices. Samsung bears higher costs on marketing and has higher margins than many, which raises prices. So, the Snapdragon 653 here may come under the same scrutiny. However, it is our first experience with this SoC and that makes it quite interesting.. The 653 is the Pro version to the 652, much like the 820 and 821. Qualcomm has raised the maximum frequency of the four Cortex A72 cores to 1.95GHz from 1.80GHz on the 652. In addition, the 653 can take up to 8GB of RAM, which allows Samsung to provide 6GB of LPDDR3 RAM on this device. The Cortex A53 cores, meant for efficiency, are allowed a maximum of 1.44 GHz.. Samsung has used this extra frequency quite interestingly. In regular usage, the Cortex A72 cores should ideally not be needed, but Samsung unchains one of these cores to nearly 1.6GHz, making transmissions smoother than smooth. The burst of speed is used when launching apps and transitioning through the AI. You see minor frame drops at times, but things are largely flagship-like.. Similarly, when games are launched, the A72 cores sometimes clocked up to their maximum, depending on the game.. Overall, this leads to extremely smooth performance, with only a few, easy to ignore stutters. The device has 4GB of free RAM at most times, keeping many apps open in the background for extremely long periods. You don't necessarily need this much RAM, but it's a pleasant surprise when an app you opened yesterday can be restarted from where you left it, almost 12 hours later.. Frankly speaking, the benchmark numbers don’t do the phone much justice here. The Galaxy C9 Pro has been a treat to use over the past week. Yes, a flagship class SoC would be better, but the Snapdragon 653 does the job admirably and well beyond what most people would need. The Adreno 510 GPU is also clocked slightly higher here.. I found no lags on gaming and though frame rates don’t always touch 30fps, they’re there most of the times. At other times, CPU load is kept below 25%, which is great and most interestingly, Qualcomm’s Trepn Profiler shows Touchwiz Home and SystemUI accounting for 0%. If there's on complaint about performance, it's that the C9 Pro does have a tendency to heat up, especially now that the weather's getting warmer. The phone reaches nearly 41 degrees celcius on 15 minutes of gaming, while I also saw internal temperatures of 50+ degress. This doesn't happen in general usage, but a little push is all it needs. Of course, the slim profile and higher processor frequency account for this behaviour.. All of this is powered by a 4000mAh battery, running the show on the background. It’s safe to say that this is Samsung’s best performing smartphone as far as battery life is concerned. However, there are better out there.. On a regular day’s usage, with the screen on auto brightness, the phone lasts for about 11.5 hours. That includes about 25 minutes playing the battery intensive Pokemon Go , an hour of video streaming on WiFi, lots of IMs, and exactly six phone calls. That's a full work day’s worth of battery life and then some more.. On the PC Mark Work 2.0 battery test, the phone lasts for 9 hours and 1 minute. It supports fast charging, with 10-100% charge possible in just under an hour.. Samsung made a confounding choice in skipping 4K video capture on this device. While not many are recording video in 4K right now, the fact that the Snapdragon 653 support 4K capture in 30fps makes the choice baffling. Having 4K video capture would have made the Galaxy C9 Pro tick off one more feature that a niche, flagship buying audience would enjoy.. Having said that, even if you could do without 4K video capture, the C9 Pro’s camera doesn’t really excel otherwise. It’s far removed from Samsung’s flagship phones and is especially weak in terms of low light performance, something that the company has lately made huge progress in. The Galaxy C9 Pro's camera can take good photos under sunlight, which is true pretty much every smartphone in this price range. However, in lower light conditions, as in indoor lights, clubs or just outdoors at nights, the phone fails quite resoundingly, given its price.. Click to access all image samples. Images are quite noisy and not very high on details, unless clicked under good light. The same can be said about the colours, which look fine when shooting during daytime, but less than optimal light will again lead the phone to mess up white balance. Overall, a few good filters and post processing can make your photos share-worthy for social media, but this is nowhere close to the best Samsung can offer. It's a shame that the company chose to have such a big difference between its flagships and this device. The only part of the camera that seems to have carried over is the instant app launch time and fast focusing and processing speeds.. I questioned Samsung’s pricing when this device was launched, and I can’t deny that the Galaxy C9 Pro is expensive. However, I have no qualms in stating that the Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro is the best big screen smartphone to buy right now.. In the under 40k range, phones like the OnePlus 3T ( review ) and Moto Z ( review ) do provide better value, but for the niche audience looking for this big a screen, this is a much better choice than the Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra. The Galaxy C9 Pro is also a better phone than the Xiaomi Mi Max, in so far as it’s faster, has a much better display and better camera.. In pure comparative terms, that doesn’t justify almost double the pricing, but if you do want a premium phablet to flaunt around, the Galaxy C9 Pro is indeed a the best you can get..
