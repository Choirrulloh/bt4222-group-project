All Application Reviews Cases Reviews Gadget Reviews Games Reviews Web Stuff Reviews. Reviews Gadget Reviews OPPO A77 Review – a Great Value for the Price. Great value phone for the price you pay. OPPO A77 Review – Smartphone manufacturers make a different range of smartphones, aimed for different groups of people. For example, if you really like taking photos in low light, you’ll have to opt for a more premium, expensive device.. For some others, they only use their phones to stay in touch with their loved ones, or browsing for news and social media feed. They don’t need a $1,200 phone. That’s where the new OPPO A77 comes into play. It’s aimed for those who are conscious about their budget, or simply don’t need the latest and greatest out there.. That does not mean the OPPO A77 is bad or does not have anything to brag. For a start, the device is equipped with OPPO’s fast fingerprint reader and it unlocks as fast as OPPO’s more premium devices, including the new OPPO R11 flagship phone (check our review on the OPPO R11 ).. As for the design itself, OPPO A77 is only 3 grams heavier than the OPPO R11 (though somehow feels heavier in hand) and does not feel as premium, but the materials used actually make the phone non-slippery to hold.. And, like the other OPPO devices, the packaging comes with a transparent case to protect your shiny new phone, and further improves the grip.. OPPO A77 comes with a unique Triple-Slot Tray (something that I haven’t seen before) so you can place 2 Nano SIM cards AND a microSD for an extra storage. Usually, you have to trade the microSD for the second SIM card.. Advertised as a phone with 16MP Beautify Camera, the A77 definitely rewards those who love to take selfies. It comes with “Beautify” mode that does its magic to remove wrinkles and other unwanted blemish from your face (like pimples), plus a Bokeh effect. You can also pick how extreme you want the software to “smooth” your face up. I found that level 2-3 is the perfect balance and doesn’t make you look like a barbie doll unnaturally. Palm Shutter action to take picture is also supported so you can take selfies easier.. Before applying Beautify (on the left) and after:. The Bokeh effect is not as good as the R11’s Portrait mode but to be fair, this is coming from a non-dual lens camera – meaning, it has a lot more software emulation and inaccuracy:. OPPO A77’s 13MP Rear Camera takes good shots too, though not as great as the higher end OPPO R11 (but costs $200 more).. A77 is still capable to take some low light shots (with a software help to smooth the noise out) but it is not made for taking them. The results are not horrible unless you need to enlarge and make them to a wallpaper or print. When there is some light, the camera lens amazingly can cope with the scene.. Performance wise, the phone is good to use as a daily driver, as long as you don’t expect a super buttery smooth experience. For example, infinite scrolling tends to get stuttered at times but it is expected for a phone of this price. However, opening and running apps feel fine, I could play Hearthstone without frustrations, and I was quite happy with its functionalities and overall performance. Mind you, the A77 is actually powered by an octa-core 64-bit processor (MT6750T) and 4GB of RAM.. OPPO A77 is a successor to OPPO A57 that we reviewed earlier this year and for the price you are paying, you are getting a very good deal with OPPO A77.. It’s $448, but you will be getting an octa-core Android phone with 4GB of RAM, dual-sim + microSD for expandable storage, a fast fingerprint sensor (which works for unlocking and as a secure method to log in to certain apps), reasonably well front and rear cameras, and quite a premium look-and-feel.. You can purchase OPPO A77 at JB Hi-Fi Australia. Disclosure: OPPO A77 review sample was supplied for reviewing but all opinions are mine and not paid.

4.1 from 9 reviews. Your trust is our top concern. Companies can't alter or remove reviews from ProductReview.com.au.. 4 out of 5 ,. Oppo phones are usually underrated and unknown. However they are great in so many ways. They are user friendly to begin with so that is great for those who aren't as tech friendly. The camera quality is also a plus and a joy to use. Altogether this phone was a great purchase.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. Basically, you pay for cheap decent price for Apple iphone look alike phone :). Overall, I am impressed by the quality of photos taken with its camera and the whopping long hours battery life. I normally just use my phone for surfing the internet and make some phone calls and it literally last me for 2 and a half days. So, if you are looking for a reliable phone that gives you long battery life smart phone, go for Oppo A77. You will not regret after your purchase.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Perfect for dual sim use in Australia. 3 out of 5 ,. Does not run on Android operating system, but operates much like my Samsung S6. Works perfectly on 3G and 4G network as most dual sim phones use 2G network which renders a dual sim phone useless now that 2G is unavailable. Removable battery and SD card insert slot. Comes with great quality clear silicone cover.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Good value for money but a bit buggy. 4 out of 5 ,. The Oppo A77 is good value for money, this was our pick over a Samsung Galaxy S7 however like the other S7 we own it's not of the same quality, there have been niggling little issues like SMS's not coming through and some setting difficult to find, that said overall a good phone great value for its price point, ticks all the boxes feature wise.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. Got this for Christmas and love it !. Easy to drive and happy with it thus far. It has a dual sim whch is brilliant for a self employed person like me. Was able to import all my contacts etc via google (email). Good selection of ring tones etc. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Good specs for the price but do your research.. 3 out of 5 ,. I picked this up as an emergency replacement for my old Google Nexus 5X. I'm still getting used to the phone but I can say it's quite painful going from Android 8.1 all the way back down 6.0. I believe this model is getting up to around 12 months old but Android 6.0 is now 3 years old. From what I've read Oppo are very slow at releasing Android updates. Had I known this it may have been a deal-breaker. Camera, general speed of phone and the ability to carry 2 SIM cards and a SD card are all positives. However, the lack of a NFC chip is also a drawback, especially as paying with your phone becomes more common. Overall I'm finding the phone significantly harder to use than previous pure Android experiences. Information widgets (such as the Pocket Weather app) aren't working at all. I also like to keep my apps down to just 2 screens and hide everything else. I can group apps but haven't yet worked out how to hide them. I'm also having problems with clearing notifications from messaging apps. I'm currently reading up on tips and instructions, which is not something I normally need to do.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. I purchased my Oppo A77 as a replacement for a Samsung S8 which I sold to cover other expenses./. It took me awhile to get used to it but am happy with the results. It takes good photos which are really clear. When I first got it I set up a security grid on it and promptly forgot the grid. I was travelling from Brisbane to Melbourne and was able to go via Oppo's NSW warehouse to get it reset which was great. It would have taken a couple of weeks to do it by post.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Value for money, everything you want in a smartphone. 5 out of 5 ,. This phone is the second Oppo phone in the household. The photo quality is very good and the many photo setting options i.e. panorama, normal, beautify, filters, flash, time lapse, double exposure, timer, gesture, voice activated video, collage are more than adequate for standard photography. The first battery charge takes 2 hours but the succeeding recharge takes 30 minutes if I recharge when battery is less than 30%. Internet connectivity is fast and lets you know when you are online or offline if you set notifications ON. The only thing I can not change is the sound for notifications, it is the same for both our Oppo F1s and A77. Apps update automatically so no need to check for updates. Another feature i like is the no disturb mode where you can set the phone to turn on to mute at certain time on weekdays, weekend or special event. I have my social media, emails, calendar, skype activated on messenger so it is not only a phone but also an organiser/PA. I always sign off my apps so if I accidentally lose the phone no one can access my account and it does not use mobile data if I am not at home. The phone signs you in automatically when you activate the app. It came with a clear protective case, anti-scratch film and Gorilla glass screen. Screen aspect ratio is very good. The finger print unlock does not always work, do not know if it has something to do with the screen sensitivity. However there is a backup personalised Pattern to unlock the phone. No need to unlock phone when answering calls which makes it very convenient when you are in a hurry. For exactly the same features described above this is very good value in fact half the price of the expensive brands. I am very happy with the phone and recommends it highly. Beware of ebay retailers based in Malaysia. They advertised they are affiliated with an Australian company and warehouse is based in Sydney but this is not correct as there is no office address and phone in Australia. These retailers will accept your order and payment but will not deliver after a string of alibis that they did not receive the order due to computer glitch, box is damaged thus courier will not accept and out of stock so further delays. I also read in ebay reviews that these sellers also sell refurbished phones. Buy only from legitimate Australian sellers.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. Pretty impressed with this phone after dropping another Iphone in water I did not want to pay for another Iphone!. So i searched for a similar phone for a cheaper price!. This phone was my choice :) and I am really happy with it. Great camera and a really nice looking phone people often think I still have an Iphone. Sometimes it does freeze as I am a heavy phone user and like to put lots of apps on my phone so I think if you are used too using alot of applications you might not want this phone but other then that it was worth every penny and I enjoyed the saving :).

The OPPO A77 was already outed in Taiwan last month, but it seems like another variant is in the pipeline. The upcoming version, dubbed as the OPPO A77t, recently surfaced on the Chinese TENAA authority.. Remember the OPPO A77 that launched in Taiwan last month? There's a new variant of the device that surfaced on the Chinese TENAA authority recently. The new model, named OPPO A77t, does not look similar to the current OPPO A77 and is expected to come with quite different specifications and features from the original one. The main difference in the design is on the back panel and the placement of the rear camera. The antenna bands that run horizontally in the original OPPO A77 have shifted to the top and bottom edges in the OPPO A77t. There's also a capsule-shaped camera module which encloses the rear snapper and the LED flash instead of the usual separate placement of the sensor and the flash. It also has a body dimension and body weight of 153.3 x 75.9 x 7.4mm and 148g, which is slightly different from the regular OPPO A77's dimension of 153.3 x 75.2 x 7.2mm and weight of 153g.. Regarding the specs, we can have the recent TENAA listing of the impending OPPO A77 variant as a reference. As per the listing, the OPPO A77t sports a 5.5-inch LCD screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. It ships with an Octa-core processor clocked at 2.0GHz under the hood which could either be a Helio P10 or Snapdragon 625 chipset. The device packs 4GB of RAM and 64GB internal memory storage. On the camera department, the OPPO A77t features a 13-megapixel rear-facing shooter and a 16-megapixel selfie snapper up front. It runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat OS out-of-the-box and a battery size of 3115mAh which is comparably smaller than that of the OPPO A77's 3200mAh cell.. The new variant of the OPPO A77 is expected to launch in China this coming August. However, details regarding its pricing and availability are still not known as of the moment..

(Photo: Oppo official website) The Oppo A77.. Launched in Taiwan last month, the Oppo A77 is already getting a bit of an upgrade, at least based on the latest leaks involving the device.. A revamped version of the Oppo A77 recently popped by the Chinese telecom certification agency TENAA , showing off a new set of specifications and possibly some design tweaks.. This new Oppo A77 will be equipped with an octa-core processor superior to the one on the original. The chipset is clocked at 2.0GHz, slightly higher than the current version's 1.5GHz.. believes that the power source in question could either be a MediaTek Helio P10 chipset or a Qualcomm Snapdragon 635 processor.. Whichever Oppo goes with, both should make for an improvement on power and performance compared with the MediaTek MT6750T processor used on the current Oppo A77.. This upgraded version of the handset will also have Android 7.1.1 Nougat pre-installed. When the standard version was launched last month, it only had Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box.. While the imaging department will still consist of a 13 MP primary shooter and a 16 MP selfie snapper, the former is now under the same window as the camera flash, making it look like the dual camera setup on the Oppo R11.. While the device got some upgrades, the new Oppo A77 got downscaled in the battery side of things. The battery on the new version is smaller at 3,115 mAh.. The original came with a 3,200 mAh battery pack. This may be one of the reasons the new Oppo A77 is lighter than the current model by five grams.. The display department remained untouched as the upgraded version still has the 5.5-inch full high-definition (HD) LCD screen.. There is no word on the release date of this iteration of the Oppo A77 although it is believed it will be exclusively offered in China..
