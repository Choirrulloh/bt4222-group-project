These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg)..

The Huawei Mate 10 sits alongside the Mate 10 Pro at the top of Huawei’s 2017 phone lineup, offering a big phone with a heap of features.. Given the latter’s branding, you might assume that the regular Mate 10 – featuring a pretty boring LCD, not OLED, screen, less RAM and half the storage – is the lessor phone in the lineup.. On some level, you’d be right. However, following a solid fortnight with the device, I’ve found a number of subtle differences that in some ways make the Mate 10 a superior handset to the Pro.. If you can get your mitts on a regular Mate 10, then, it’s a solid phablet that’s well worth a gander. But given the fact that Huawei isn’t planning to ship the device in the UK or the States, this may prove a difficult task.. Visually, the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro are pretty similar – which is no bad thing. The review unit I tested has a slightly curved, shiny black glass rear, with a sleek black strip at the top running over its Leica-branded dual-camera sensors. Combined with the metal sides, the end result is a phone that looks like a pretty refined, significantly more top-end, HTC U11 .. In addition, the slimmed down screen bezel on the Mate 10’s front also marks it out as a noticeable step up on the company’s previous Huawei P10 Plus, and one of the prettiest phablets currently on the market.. On the Mate 10’s sides you’ll find a few important additions that differentiate it from the Pro device. Chief among these is a 3.5mm headphone jack and microSD slot.. Some people may deem these two ports pointless additions, especially considering the Mate 10 Pro comes with 128GB of built-in storage, as opposed to the regular phablet’s 64GB. But for me, the headphone jack is still a useful inclusion.. Ever since every company under the sun decided to follow Apple’s lead and ditch the 3.5mm jack to save space, audiophiles have been put between a rock and a hard place. You can either invest in one of the multitude of flimsy USB-C adapters, which usually break within a week or two, or compromise on audio quality and invest in a wireless set.. Words can’t express the joy I’ve experienced using the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 without a dongle during my morning commute throughout last week.. Elsewhere, the Mate 10 features all the trimmings of a 2017 flagship. There’s a USB-C port with Huawei’s proprietary SuperCharge tech on its bottom, and a front-facing home button with a built-in fingerprint scanner. Like all Huawei phones I’ve tested recently, the scanner is wonderfully snappy, reading my fingerprint with zero issue or lag.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. My only minor quibble with the design is that, like all glass-backed phones, the Mate 10’s rear is a smudge magnet. Within minutes of using the device, the back was covered in fingerprint marks and needed a wipe down.. I’m also not convinced that the rear of the device will survive anything more than a minor drop scratch, or worse still, crack-free. Although, being fair to Huawei, this is a risk with all glass-backed phones, including the iPhone X and Galaxy S8 .. The Mate 10 has a completely different screen to the Pro. Specifically, the regular Mate 10 comes with a 5.8-inch, quad-HD LCD panel, while the Pro packs a 6-inch, HD+ OLED display.. On paper, the quad-HD resolution gives the Mate 10 the edge. However, unless you really try to spot pixels, the Pro’s HD+ 2160 x 1080 is more than sharp enough. The real difference will be in terms of the classic LCD vs OLED debate.. In general, OLED screens offer better contrast ratios, deeper blacks and are more vibrant than their LCD rivals. This is because they electrically charge each individual pixel to generate colours, but also work to reduce the screen’s power consumption. By comparison, LCD screens charge the entire panel. The downsides as a result are that whites appear dirtier, viewing angles aren’t the best, and the displays are more of a faff to calibrate.. All the above holds true in this instance. The Pro’s screen is more vibrant, has warmer colours and, in general, looks a little punchier.. That said, the regular Mate 10’s screen is far from terrible. Whites are significantly cleaner, and although blacks don’t live up to those of OLED, they’re suitably deep. A few members of team Trusted felt that colours were a little on the cool side; but in my opinion they appeared balanced to the naked eye. All in all, I had no issue with the regular Mate 10’s screen during my time with it.. Brightness levels, too, were solid – and, according to Huawei, will meet the HDR10 mobile standard. However, until the apps are updated to unlock HDR content on the Mate 10, I can’t check high dynamic range performance.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

The Good Huawei’s Mate 10 gives you performance and cameras comparable to Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 and Google’s Pixel XL 2, but for several hundred bucks less. It also has a headphone jack.. The Bad The phone’s battery doesn’t last as long as the Mate 10 Pro despite being the same size. Huawei’s Android software could be smoother and the phone isn’t getting an official release in the US or UK.. The Bottom Line The Huawei Mate 10 may be hard for you to get your hands on, but it’s worth the effort if you want a big-screen phone and don’t quite have the budget for a Galaxy Note, iPhone Plus or Pixel 2.. More its own phone than clone. It's hard out here for Huawei. The Chinese company is responsible for many great phones, but it's rarely given its due credit. Whether or not the Mate 10 changes this can't be predicted, but Huawei has done its part: The Mate 10 is a standout phone, one that's several hundred dollars cheaper than competition from Samsung, Google and Apple -- and even shaves down the price of Huawei's own superpowered Mate 10 Pro .. The phone is powered by Huawei's estate-made Kirin 970 processor, which offers grunt in line from what you'd get from Qualcomm's premium Snapdragon 835 chip. Its beautiful 5.9-inch screen pops thanks to a 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution and the phone's slim bezels. Finally, those dual cameras shoot great pictures (see more below).. It's got its flaws, namely Huawei's imperfect EMUI software that rides on top of Android 8.0 Oreo. Plus, the camera, while impressive, falls a little shy of the Pixel 2 and new iPhone 8 range. But that's much easier to forgive when you factor in price. The Mate 10 retails for AU$899 in Australia, which converts to roughly $685 in the US and £520.. Huawei's Mate 10 is one fabulous phablet. That's a chunk cheaper than Apple's iPhone 8 Plus ($799, £799, AU$1,229), Google's Pixel 2 XL ($850, £799, AU$1,399) and Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 ($950, £869 AU$1,499). If the phone were to come to the US or UK, it'd probably be even less expensive, since those are conversions from the Australian price, and Australians almost always pay more.. But therein lies a real issue: Right now, the Mate 10 is not officially available in the US or UK. Its bigger brother, the Mate 10 Pro, is getting a UK release, and there are rumours of it coming to AT&T in the US early next year , but there are no such plans for the Mate 10.. But still, if you're after a premium phone but find what's out there a little too expensive, the Mate 10 is worth it.. Phones out of Chinese companies often look too much like other , more famous phones, most commonly iPhones. The Huawei Mate 10 doesn't have this problem. Its design is distinct, thanks mainly to it being kind of fat -- it's a wide phone, but that's a good thing. It helps the phone feel different, and its extra surface area makes it less flimsy than other phones.. However, like many big-screen phones, the Mate 10 may be a challenge if your hands are on the smaller size. Huawei gives you some help here, with a few different navigation options. There's a navigation dock, like the iPhone's Assistive Touch , which is a circle on your screen that acts as a toggle for you to go back or return to the home page. Then there's the option to remove the virtual home, back and overview buttons from the screen, and instead integrate them into the physical home button. I personally didn't use these options, but they're nice to have.. A premium design would mean nothing if the materials weren't equally luxe. Huawei has gone the Apple route here, with the Mate 10 coming with a glossy glass finish. Unlike Apple's new iPhones, though, there's no wireless charging.. The salient physical difference the Mate 10 has to the Mate 10 Pro is the fingerprint scanner. The Mate 10 Pro has slighter bezels since the scanner is on the back, while Huawei crammed a tiny home button that doubles as a touch scanner below the Mate 10's screen.. The Mate 10 has one thing the Mate 10 Pro doesn't: a headphone jack. This is becoming standard with premium phones, with both Apple and Google ditching the good ol' 35mm jack. Dual-lens cameras have found their way onto phones by Apple and Samsung, but Huawei beat both of them to the punch: Its first dual-camera phone was the P9 , released months before the iPhone 7 last year. (LG technically beat them all to dual camera with a second telephoto lens.). Hot Products. The best iPhone asks you to think different. Google Home Mini sounds great but lacks vision..

We’ll update the story as more info emerges. If Huawei is serious about beating Apple and Samsung to become the world’s top smartphone manufacturer , it needs a marquee series that can raise the bar for its entire portfolio.

We have a detailed look at the Huawei Mate 10 specs here , and this post will give you a roundup of the essential information from the official announcement .. As always though, the success of the new Mate 10, Mate 10 Pro, and Mate 10 Porsche Design will rely heavily on their price, availability and release dates.. Here’s what we know so far!. The Mate 10 is sold in following color options:. If you’re pining for the Porsche Design version , you will only be able to get it in colorway only: Diamond Black.. In the past, Huawei has dragged its feet with Mate releases, but the Chinese OEM is making sure the Mate 10 series arrives in a timely fashion.. Huawei devices have a patchy history when it comes to US availability, but there’s a good chance at least one of the Mate 10 series phones will make it over in the coming months. Based on the Mate 9’s US launch , it seems quite likely that Huawei will wait until CES 2018 to unveil the Mate 10 for the US market. There are also rumors flying around that the Mate 10 Pro will be sold exclusively at AT&T .. If you can’t wait until January, though, you can technically pick up a brand new Mate 10 or Mate 10 Pro (international versions) via unofficial Amazon sellers. It’s worth noting that these do not come with a US warranty, so if you can hold out a little longer we suggest you do so.. If you do choose to pick one up, the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro are only compatible with GSM/LTE carriers (like AT&T and T-Mobile), and are priced at $699 and $919, respectively, at time of writing.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Huawei's Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro get dual cameras, AI tech. With a glass design, big screen and supercharged processor, the Mate 10 has a lot going for it, but differences between the models are downright weird.. by October 16, 2017 1:02 PM PDT. Huawei's glass and metal Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro. Huawei's new Mate 10 phones focus on AI technology. Huawei Mate 10 (and Mate 10 Pro) specifications 5.9-inch display, 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution (Pro: 6-inch, 2,160x1,080 pixels) Dual 12-megapixel colour camera with 20-megapixel monochrome camera 8-megapixel fornt-facing camera 4,000mAh battery, non-removable, supports fast charge but no wireless charging Kirin 970 octa-core processor 4GB RAM, 64GB storage on Mate 10 (6GB, 128GB on Pro with no MicroSD support) IP67 water-resistance on the Pro only. The Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro arrive today with a full load of trendy features. Each phone packs the new supercharged Kirin 970 octa-core processor and funky dual camera on the back but also wraps them up in a slick-looking body with glass on the front and back. Apparently the Mate 10 Pro is the "main" one, and it's that one that we'll be able to buy in the UK (both models will be available in Australia). No US release for either phone has been announced yet.. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro has a 6-inch screen.. The Pro is definitely the most exciting of the two. At 6 inches, it's larger than the 5.9-inch Mate 10, but with narrower bezels on all sides, Huawei reckons that the 6-inch screen fits into the same size body you'd have found on last year's 5.5-inch devices. Huawei achieved the slimmer bezel by ditching the home button on the front, moving the fingerprint scanner to the back, below the camera. The screen now stretches right to the edges and with the Pro's resolution of 2,160x1,080 pixels, everything looks nice and crisp. Oddly, the standard Mate has a higher 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution, although I couldn't see much of a difference between them when I placed the phones side by side. The Mate 10 still has a home button and fingerprint scanner beneath the screen.. Both displays support HDR and are bright enough to sear your eyeballs right out -- or at least make them easy to use under bright sunlight.. Huawei has taken a cue from Apple in switching the rear design from metal to glass. However, while Apple made the move to support wireless charging, Huawei's decision is purely down to aesthetics -- there's no wireless charging on either version of the phone. The phones look pretty good, though that shiny glass is a total fingerprint magnet.. The shiny glass looks nice, but does not mean wireless charging is included.. The Mate 10 has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, but bizarrely, you won't find one on the Pro. Instead, you'll have to use Bluetooth headphones, or find a wired pair that plugs into the USB-C socket. Your existing 3.5mm headphones will not work with the Mate 10 Pro. The Pro version does have IP67 waterproofing however, which the standard Mate does not. Huawei argued the main reason for this difference was that it was too difficult to waterproof the headphone jack on the standard Mate. Samsung managed this perfectly well on the Galaxy S8 so I'm not happy that Huawei hasn't put more effort in here.. Huawei says its Kirin 970 octa-core processor is lightning fast, so you can expect it to handle any game you can find in the Google Play store, and image editing will be a breeze. These CPUs are also equipped with what Huawei is calling neural processing units, which will apparently improve the Mate 10 and Pro's artificial intelligence. The tangible benefits of this, according to the company, are improved battery life and camera. The phones can identify different categories of picture -- like stage, person or even dog -- and adjust camera settings accordingly before the picture is taken.. The standard Mate 10 has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, while the Pro has 6GB with 128GB of storage -- although there's no ability to expand that storage with a microSD card.. Dual cameras are on the back of the phone.. Huawei is sticking with a similar dual camera setup to those we've seen on its P10 already. A 12-megapixel sensor shoots in color, while a 20-megapixel sensor shoots exclusively in black and white. Shots from both sensors looked great on the P10 and with the Mate 10's wider aperture (now f/1.6 on both lenses, which lets in more light) and handful of software tweaks, I'm looking forward to seeing what it can do.. Huawei has yet to say exactly how much the Mates will go on sale for in the UK. In Australia, the Mate 10 will retail for AU$899 (roughly £530) while the Pro will cost $1,099 (roughly £650). Those prices convert to roughly $700 and $860, though the phone is unlikely to get a wide carrier release in the US.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Given its size, it won’t be for everyone, but with very few shortcomings it’s a definite contender for best value for money big phone of 2017.. Huawei Mate 10 price and availability Landing November 15 in Australia No US or UK availability Costs AU$899 (around $710, £530) Better than the Mate 9? Large 5.9-inch QHD screen A dual f/1.6 lens camera Newest Kirin 970 chipset Design and display A big phone with a premium finish Splash proof, but not water truly resistant Sharp screen, but less punchy than OLED rivals. The Huawei Mate 10 was announced in the shadows of the Mate 10 Pro .. It sports a lower price, beefier design, no waterproofing and no OLED screen. As a result, it’s in danger of being dismissed as the inferior, forgettable sibling.. Huawei hasn’t helped this by releasing the Mate 10 only in select markets, while the flagship Huawei Mate 10 Pro is more widely available – even in the US starting on February 18.. For many users though, the Mate 10 could be the better choice. In fact, for a certain type of user, it could be the best smartphone currently on the market.. A bold claim, but hear us out.. The Mate 10 has the same camera as that found on the Mate 10 Pro, a very competent snapper with f/1.6 lenses. It also features the brand new Kirin 970 chipset, loaded up with cutting-edge components.. Add to that mix a 4,000mAh battery, an all-important 3.5mm headphone jack and a microSD card slot – both the latter missing in the Pro variant - and the appeal of the vanilla Mate 10 fast becomes self-evident.. It also stacks up very well alongside the non-Huawei competition. It has virtually the same storage, resolution and RAM configurations as the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus , as well as the LG V30 .. The glass back and metal frame also give it a design-edge over pricier devices like the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL , while the price undercuts all the main competition, apart from the OnePlus 5 .. Add to that a pre-loaded screen protector and a soft touch case in the box and in addition to being a spec-beast, the AU$899 (around $710, £530) Huawei Mate 10 is also a reasonably priced offering given the current flagship climate – on paper at least.. Update : Deciding between Huawei and Honor's latest phones just got a bit tougher with the launch of the Honor View 10. It features the latest internals found in the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro, like the Kirin 970 and 6GB of RAM, but comes in £449 (around $600/AU$775, though may be less when it arrives).. There are certainly sacrifices made for the lower price point, like a build that's less premium and cameras that can't see into the darkness as well. But given that the Mate 10 isn't available in many regions, the View 10 is worth checking out, that is, unless opting for the Mate 10 Pro is more your style.. Confirmed for Australia, China, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, UAE and other select markets, despite being widely available, the Mate 10 doesn’t look set to launch in the UK or US just yet.. Costing AU$899 (around $710, £530) SIM free, the Mate 10 will be available in Australia from November 15, with availability for Vodafone AU and JB Hi-Fi confirmed.. The Huawei Mate 10 is the true successor to the Mate 9. It has the same size screen and virtually identical proportions.. Upping the ante, it upgrades the build from all-metal to a combination of glass and metal, resulting in a more premium fit and finish.. The Mate 10 also increases the screen resolution from Full HD to QHD, while retaining the same 5.9-inch 16:9 screen-size and aspect ratio, resulting in a much sharper display.. The camera is also improved here, with f/1.6 apertures across both dual rear lenses.. Huawei has integrated AI components into its camera UI, with a smart scene detection that, it claims, gets to know how you shoot and fine-tunes results accordingly.. The Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro also ship with the latest version of Android, Android 8, complete with EMUI 8, Huawei’s custom interface.. This also outputs to a TV or monitor to create EMUI desktop, a Samsung DeX /Microsoft Continuum-style experience that supports full keyboard and mouse input.. Round the key feature list off with a 4,000mAh battery, IR blaster for TV remote control functionality, 64GB of storage and a microSD card slot, and the Mate 10 spec-list reads very well indeed.. The new trend of metal frames and glass fronted and backed bodies has made its way onto the Huawei Mate series, and the Mate 10 is an excellent example of this design done right.. The front is all about that screen, with an impressive 81.6% screen-to-body ratio. Below the screen sits a fingerprint scanner, above it, a front camera and speaker, while to the right are all the buttons.. These protrude nicely and offer excellent, click tactility so you know exactly when you’ve pressed one. At the base is the bottom firing speaker and USB-C port, while up at the top is a 3.5mm headphone port and IR blaster.. The headphone port is one area the Huawei Mate 10 will edge ahead for many over the Mate 10 Pro, Google Pixel 2 XL and iPhone 8 Plus. Unlike the aforementioned, the Mate 10 also features a microSD card slot for expandable storage.. Around the back of the Mate 10 there's a sheet of Gorilla Glass. This is curved across both axis, so the phone feels comfortable in the hand, despite its size.. It also delivers a decent amount of grip and looks exceptionally slick in the process.. Unsurprisingly, it does attract fingerprints readily, especially in the darker variants, so if you want to keep grubby marks at bay, use the soft touch case that ships in the box.. The Mate 10 also comes pre-fitted with a screen protector, so Huawei makes sure from the get go, you won’t need to invest extra in accessories to keep your phone free of scuffs.. There's no real waterproofing or water resistance here, so the Mate 10 won't withstand a dunk, however the IP53 splash-proof rating means use in light rain and an occasional spillage nearby won't render it a shiny, pricey brick.. As for the screen, it's a 5.9-inch QHD IPS LCD panel. 5.9 inches may sound smaller than the Mate 10 Pro's 6 inches of screen, but given the Mate 10's more traditional, 16:9 aspect ratio, this is actually a bigger phone with a bigger display from a surface area point of view.. As a result, you get more screen here than you do on the Mate 10 Pro and other 6-inch 18:9 devices like the Pixel 2 XL and LG V30.. The IPS screen technology on the Mate 10 is loaded up with support for HDR10, delivering punchy colours and greater dynamic range when watching supported content.. Despite looking great in isolation, quality can’t compete with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and Mate 10 Pro with their OLED technology.. Despite this, viewing angles are very good and it all gets extremely bright – up to 730 nits .. Next Page Battery life and camera.

Huawei Mate 10 review: Warning, highly addictive. Huawei introduced three models to its phablet mate series this year. There’s the Mate 10, a more than worthy successor to the Mate 9 , and then there’s the Mate 10 Pro and Mate. All three offer similar performance, although the Mate 10 has the most traditional design. We’ll go through all its virtues and defects as well as the minor differences it has with the other models.. ✓ Can be used like a computer. Huawei Mate 10 release date and price. The Huawei Mate 10 already arrived in Australia, China, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain and the Philippines on November 2, 2017. Although the smartphone is not officially available in the US market, it can be purchased from unofficial Amazon sellers for $699, and it should be noted that it’s only compatible with GSM/LTE carriers such as AT&T and T-Mobile.. The available colors will be mocha brown, black, champagne gold and pink gold.. The Mate 10 is available in a single variant consisting of 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory. Huawei had planned to release the Mate 10 Pro through a partnership with AT&T, but after that fell through, it should still be available in the US in the Spring via online retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy for $799..

Showing its retro side with gloss, a headphone jack and an infrared port. / © AndroidPIT by Irina Efremova. The fingerprint reader on the front. / © AndroidPIT by Irina Efremova. The Huawei Mate 10 features a uniform design with very rounded edges and a metal and glass finish. It is 3.06 inches wide and weighs 186 grams. These dimensions are important to bear in mind when considering versatility and use. The Mate 10 retains a 16:9 format display, so it’s going against the grain of the current trend among flagships. This means it is still somewhat difficult to use the phone with just one hand.. The rear glass part has a main camera with two lenses that are slightly protruding. have a metal ring to protect the Leica lenses. The camera area has a band that reflects light somewhat differently, attracting enough attention and giving the device a dash of elegance.. On the front side we see the screen with the standard 16:9 format. This is the same we saw with the Mate 9, but different than the Mate 10 Pro, which features an 18:9 format. But in spite of having a wide format, the frame is slightly thinner in comparison to the Mate 9. The Mate 10’s format feels a little less ergonomic in the hand. It gives you a certain sense of insecurity because it’s heavy and slippery. It does, however, come with a transparent cover that can help ease this feeling.. Below the screen there’s a quite narrow band that includes the fingerprint reader, which works very quickly. In the upper part of the frame there’s a camera dedicated to selfies, the proximity sensor, the speakerphone and a hidden LED in the left corner.. The frame is metallic, but has been lacquered. It has a striking gloss and gives the same impression as the glass on the back. There are visible bands on the upper and lower frame to isolate the contact of the different antennas. On the left there’s the tray for inserting a nanoSIM card and microSD.. Not only does the 16:9 format give it a slightly ‘retro’ feel, it also features an infrared port and headphone minijack on the top of the frame. The Mate 10 Pro also features the infrared port, but the 3.5mm minijack has been removed and the box doesn’t come with an adapter for it.... The Mate 10 Pro comes with a waterproof and dustproof IP67. certificate, which means that it can withstand complete immersion. The Mate 10 only comes with an IP53, which means it can withstand splashes of water, but that it still shouldn’t get wet.. Mate 10 with the traditional 16:9 format. / © AndroidPIT by Irina Efremova. The Huawei Mate 10 features a 5.9-inch FullView display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 and 499 ppi.. Compared to the Pro version, there are a quite a few differences in the screen. The diagonals are quite similar, but since they have different proportions they don’t really look the same. Both devices have very fine frames. The display occupies 81% of the front surface of the device, which for the sake of comparison is 2% less than the iPhone X.. The Mate 10 Pro has an AMOLED panel and the Mate 10 utilizes an IPS LCD panel. Both screens have square corners and are very good, but if we put the two next to each other, the AMOLED is of course more striking. But the Mate 10’s IPS display is still top of the range with excellent brightness, sharpness and sensational colors.. Easy Projection turns Mate 10 into a PC. Huawei’s Easy Projection is much more practical than Samsung DeX. The Mate 10 is also a pocket PC. Mate 10 Pro Easy Projection review. This is the newest feature of the Mate 10 and allows you to use your smartphone as a desktop computer. Among the previous experiments to converge a smartphone and a PC, I find this rendition to be the most compelling since the BQ Aquaris M10 tablet was paired with Ubuntu Touch .. Unlike Samsung DeX , you don’t need an expensive accessory with the Mate 10. All you need is a C-type USB to HDMI adapter, a wireless mouse and a keyboard. There are also some HDMI and USB adapters for using a keyboard and mouse combo with a dongle.. Just plug the device into a screen and you’re up and running. You can also use the smartphone screen as a trackpad to move your cursor around the large screen and use the virtual keyboard to type. It is very easy and simple as well as fast. The best part is that you can use the phone completely normally even if there’s a desktop session open.. There are only two things to keep in mind: the sound is not sent over HDMI and the information that isn’t saved during the desktop session will be lost if you disconnect the screen cable. The desktop doesn’t function as smoothly when using the phone and there is still a lot of room for improvement, but this is one of the best beginnings we’ve seen with this technology to date.. Huawei EMUI 8: Definitely not the evolution we were hoping for. EMUI and Android, each in their respective eighth edition. / © AndroidPIT by Irina Efremova. / © AndroidPIT by Irina Efremova. The entire Mate 10 series comes equipped with Android 8.0 Oreo, but is heavily tuned with the manufacturer's customization layer: EMUI 8.0. EMUI has its share of both fans and critics. The eighth version is a good upgrade and introduces the main features of Oreo. The Mate 10 processor has a neural processing unit (NPU) that should bring advantages to future applications, but so far little has been seen.. Those of you who are already familiar with Huawei’s customization layer won’t find many surprises. Simply put, some people like it and some people don’t, In the end it’s just a matter of getting used to it. One of the more interesting features that the device offers, besides being able to use it as a computer, is the option of having duplicate applications with different accounts.. In the Mate 10 you can use the fingerprint sensor as a substitute for the navigation buttons on the screen. Slide your finger over it to the right to open multitasking. Slide it to the left to go backwards. This feature doesn’t work as well as Motorola’s version, but it’s a good solution to take better advantage of the screen. If you keep the start button pressed,. there's of course the handy Google Assistant .. The three Mate 10 models incorporate the brand's new processor with artificial intelligence. The Kirin 970 is the strongest SoC on the market to date and is a rival to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 in terms of performance.. To go into greater detail, the Kirin 970 processor is built with an architecture of 10 nanomers. It is a chip with eight cores: 4 Cortex-A73 ARM at 2.36GHz and 4 Cortex-A53 ARM at 1.8GHz, which also has the special neural processing unit (NPU). For graphics performance, mount a 12-core Mali G72 GPU.. Machine learning and artificial intelligence will play a very important role in Huawei devices and Mate 10 is the first link.. With 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage (with microSD support), the Mate 10 offers performance almost identical to the Mate 10 Pro with 6GB of RAM. Everything moves fast and it's a delight to play with the device.. The headphone jack and transparent case are included.. / © AndroidPIT by Irina Efremova. Fortunately, the Mate 10 retains the headphone minijack, which the Mate 10 Pro did away with. Everyday more and more people switch to wireless sound, but for those who are nostalgic for the analog days like I am, this is a big plus for this device. The smartphone only offers Bluetooth 4.2 for wireless audio, and in this regard we would expect more from the Huawei flagship.. The Chinese manufacturer always equips its devices with high quality audio for calls. For this phone, both the waves that are emitted and received are modulated thanks to its chip with artificial intelligence.. Like the Mate 9, the ambient speaker is also of very good quality and doesn't have a lot of metal sounds, as you would expect on a smartphone.. Huawei's double camera is beginning to be a classic. / © AndroidPIT by Irina Efremova. Front camera in a minuscule frame. / © AndroidPIT by Irina Efremova. Gallery of pictures taken with the Huawei Mate 10. All three models come with the same camera equipment. At the rear there are two Leica Summilux-H lenses, one on a 20 MP black and white sensor and the other on a 12 MP RGB sensor with optical image stabilizer. The two sensors have an aperture of f/1.6 and there is also a laser sensor for phase-detection focusing.. Its images are spectacular with very good brightness and dynamic ranges. The color rendering is quite natural but in very light conditions photographs have exceptional brightness. Colors with low light lead to noisy effects, since the focus is more on respecting the contours.. The front camera has an 8MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture and is also able to produce a bokeh effect, although it has its limitations if there are some gaps in the foreground where the background of the scene is exposed. The main camera also has some issues with this.. The camera is where we can best see how the NPU works. This artificial intelligence unit is able to recognize 13 different objects and optimize the quality of the shots accordingly. It can do all this without the user having to touch complicated settings. It results in superb photos in almost any situation and with a very fast shooting speed.. The Mate 10 comes with a very fast charger.. / © AndroidPIT by Irina Efremova. The Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro are boosted with a 4000 mAh battery with fast charging support. With the device turned off, it takes just 26 minutes to charge from 0% to 50% and it can charge entirely in less than an hour and a half. This speed is quite surprising considering it has 1000 mAh more than most smartphones.. The story is quite different when the battery is draining. With very intense use you might be able to get 6 hours of screen time in a day. With battery optimizations, you can get 5 hours of screen time over a day and a half of use.. 150.5 x 77.8 x 8.2 mm. 2560 x 1440 pixels (499 ppi). HSPA, LTE, NFC, Dual-SIM , Bluetooth 4.2. The Huawei Mate 10 offers almost the same impressive features as the Pro variant: the latest Kirin processor equipped with artificial intelligence, an impressive camera, the latest version of Android and the ability to use it as a real computer.. The price is not exorbitant and Huawei offers it for $100 cheaper if you forget the AMOLED panel, the 18:9 format and a few gigabytes of memory. In return it offers the same performance, the same autonomy, the same camera, fingerprint reader on the front and a minijack connector for headphones that you’ll only find in the Mate 10.. In terms of what you invest and what you get in the return, the Mate 10 is a good device that will continues to improve even once its value depreciates. What do you think of the Huawei Mate 10? Is exceeding your expectations or are there improvements that you’d like to see implemented?. iv had the mate 10 since it was released, crazy long battery life. its been a great follow up to the mate 9 i had. i am glad its kept the 16.9 screen, not a fan of the narrow screens. i wish it had Bluetooth 5. it has a few glitches like most phones but i really like it. i was with Samsung until they kept me waiting years to upgrade from my note 4, so i jumped ship. Too many sacrifices vs Samsung for the price point for me.. MWC 2018 live updates: Sony shakes up the Xperia XZ2 design. * Please enter a valid email address. Almost done!
