It is more like ANDROID 7 1.1 gave me more glitches than ANDROID oreo in my own usage. I forgot to ask if it's running Oreo... but that's a relief seeing also that the SD845 will inevitably be compromised too; I heard somewhere that they slowed down a bit - Thanks!.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars A Great Phone - Style - Speed - And That 4K Display!!!. Color: Black | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. Purchased after 4 iPhones over the years. Also thoroughly reviewed the newest Samsung and LG phones, and did like the Samsung, but not as much as this one. The 4K display is at the cutting edge, and those who say "Who needs 4K on a tiny phone?" have no idea the difference it can make! If you ever want to use a VR 3D viewer, then you'll SO notice the difference. And even if you don't, you'll see details you never saw on other phones. The design/styling is very "Bauhaus" and looks simple and elegant. I really like the Galaxy too, but I'd call it a little over-styled. I like the curved glass edges on the Samsung - yeah, they're cool - but they can also be a source of reflected glare, making edge details hard to see or read. And while some don't like the edge bezels on the Sony, I think they look clean and refined. I also found that - holding the Samsung - I'm constantly covering up information on the screen edges that I want to see. On the Sony, I do wish that the speaker volume were a little louder, but it is very usable. I use some Sony headphones I've had for years, and they have a decently high 'sensitivity' rating, about 105 db, which gives a really strong volume for music and videos - it is not the least bit weak. I can blast my ears off with it. I think some may be using low sensitivity headphones, which can sound great with a lot of power - but they tax the power of weaker headphone outputs. Try a headphone with good sensitivity, and you'll be happy. The Camera is everything you could ask for in a modern phone - perhaps a half notch below that of the Galaxy. Not perfect, but nothing is - still excellent. And it does have that ultra-slow 960 fps slow-motion, and the 4K is outstanding. I have no issues with the still camera, the autofocus, and other features. But I have an excellent big camera for when I need true pro features. No phone is there yet, but they are improving each generation. And the XZ Premium still comes very close in quality to low-level pro cameras, and might actually be overkill for personal use. Speed of use is SUPER FAST opening apps, checking mail, using the phone, browsing - even viewing images and videos in full 4K - all you could want and more. Snapdragon 835 is no slouch - neck and neck with the very best! The touch screen is effortlessly smooth and a pleasure to use, gestures interpreted well. So you don't think I'm only positive, here's the mostly minor other side... I do hope that Sony will fix a few things in their First firmware update: 1. Do boost the volume, and dispense with the unnecessarily low 'loud limit,' which is too low (though you can always override it). Don't forget the ringer volume (or louder ringtones please?). Make the Fingerprint Reader work for US customers!... What, are we so inferior to Europeans, Brits, and Japanese in your eyes, Sony? Not a deal-breaker, but really?? 3. Give us full control of the Resolution and Audio Settings for the phone, so that we can decide when full resolution - 4K - is important, and when battery life is more important. Sony can't know when we NEED something, but we are capable of making that choice ourselves, I think. I'd take a few more "modern" ringtones, but I can do that myself ... If you use your phone a LOT, and the display image is important to you, then this is just about the only phone that jumps ahead in resolution - and the other phones WILL be upping theirs (perhaps in another generation or two), but the Sony has 4K now ... The stereo speakers will not knock your socks off or power your Block Party, but they are nice if you want a medium low background sound, and it's in Stereo. And the audio sounds beautiful and powerful through good, sensitive headphones or most any stereo input. It feels great and solid in your hand, and it can be operated with just one hand, though two is better due to size. The menus are really not bad at all - just takes a few minutes to get it after 4 iPhones. I just can't stop myself finding reasons to look at everything on the 4K display. (3840 X 2160 pixels!) A very few detractions, but still five stars.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great Audio, Perfect Smartphone For Me!. Color: Black | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. Fantastic smartphone by Sony, I love it so far. (I bought the Deepsea Black version. ) I also tried the HTC U11 for a few days last week, but I returned it. I definitely like the XZ Premium better. Surprisingly, the audio performance in particular made the biggest difference for me between these two flagships. The "acoustic chamber" of the HTC U11 makes the highs in audio playback sound distant, but on the XZ Premium they are crystal clear. (Lows do sound slightly better on the U11.) I played "The Ecstasy Of Gold" on both, and the mids and highs were much better on the Sony. Also, I appreciate that Sony still includes a stock email client with the built-in ability to reduce photo attachment sizes. That may sound insignificant, but for me it's pretty important. Only Samsung and LG seem to still do so as well, so good on ya, Sony. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, signal reception is top notch with this phone, you won't be disappointed. I work in a weak cell reception area, but the XZ Premium performs like a champ there. I also love Sony's Album (gallery app) which you can theme dark, and it allows you to pinch the gallery in and out as you scan through photos and videos. Again, this may be insignificant to some, but for me it is very important. The total price for the XZ Premium is a bit steep; I think that it should've been around $700.00 instead of $800.00, but I still believe that it will be worth it in the long run. Thanks Sony, for this beast of a smartphone!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars One of the best android flagships of the year!. Color: Black | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. I have the s8, htcu11, and the Pixel xl and this phone beats them all. Mostly as comfort in hand and ease of use but the screen is stunning, the phone is blazing fast and the features are amazing. This will be my daily driver for quite some time, besides great battery life, excellent sound and amazing pictures this is the best android phone in 2017.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Best phone I have ever owned. Color: Black | Offer Type: Phone Only. This phone is the best phone I have ever owned. It also won the 2017 MWC best phone of the year award. I got the version with the finger print sensor and it works extremely well. All glass and aluminum and the black has quite a lot of blue in it. It feels very premium and high quality in the hand. The 4K HDR screen is phenomenal especially when you turn on the super vivid mode combined with the X-reality engine on and full brightness. The screen blows away any other phone on the market and my colleagues who have S8 and iPhone 7s plus are blown away with the deep black levels, sharp contrasts and really vibrant colors. The battery life is quite good with the 3300 mAH battery. I get about 2 - 3 days out of it. Cameras both front and rear facing are amazing. I have shot some 4K HDR videos and pictures and they come out incredible. Have not tried the slow motion yet, but saw the stock videos it comes with. All in all, this is the most innovative phone on the market. If you don't care about bezels and would much rather have the high definition speakers and big camera sensors, this phone is for you.. Was this review helpful to you?. I ve had software issues, apps stop runing, the headphonejack too. Some other users will tell you the same, in this phone and in the z1. 4.0 out of 5 stars Headphonejack stoped working after 1 month. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars.

Sony is still stuck in a bit of a design rut, and it’s struggling to compete with the might of Apple and Samsung, while the likes of LG, Huawei and Motorola continue to offer stiff competition.. The Xperia XZ Premium is Sony’s chance to put itself firmly back on the smartphone map, but has it succeeded?. This will likely come as no surprise, but this was not a cheap phone at launch. The Sony Xperia XZ Premium price initially was £649 ($799, around AU$1,100), which saw it rub shoulders with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 7 Plus in terms of cost.. The good news is that, since its June 2017 arrival, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium price has now dropped and, if you shop around, can be found for £499 ($540, about AU$700) SIM-free.. It means contract deals are also more attractive now, if you'd rather spread the cost over a couple of years. If you are considering picking up the Xperia XZ Premium though, you may want to hold on a little bit.. Sony is tipped to launch the successor to the handset (the XZ Premium 2 ) at MWC 2018 at the end of February, so an even better version could be available to you very soon. if the new version doesn't take your fancy, it'll likely drive the price of the current XZ Premium down further.. Find out what the Sony Xperia XZ Premium is like to live with by watching our 'week with' video.. 156 x 77 x 7.9mm OS : Android 8 Screen size : 5.46 inches Resolution : 2160 x 3840 CPU : Snapdragon 835 RAM : 4GB Storage : 64GB Battery : 3,230mAh Rear camera : 19MP Front camera : 13MP. Sony's phone may be Premium in name, but it's not overly so in nature. When it comes to design the Sony Xperia XZ Premium leaves something to be desired compared to its flagship rivals.. The Gorilla Glass 5 front and rear at least provides some tough protection, but the sides of phone are noticeably plastic, and it’s this material which you feel when you hold the phone.. It’s a shame, as it makes the handset feel cheaper than it is – something you don’t want when spending top dollar – and the flat front and back means it doesn’t nestle in the hand as neatly as some of the more curved devices on the market.. We found the glass was a real fingerprint magnet – much like the Galaxy S8 and Jet Black iPhone 7 – so it can quickly end up looking messy.. Sony Xperia XZ Premium hands on gallery. There’s also a lot of bezel around the display, which pushes the dimensions of the XZ Premium to 156 x 77 x 7.9mm, making it taller and wider than the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 – phones which boast bigger screens than the Sony.. These bezels do allow for stereo front-facing speakers, and provide space for you to hold the phone in landscape orientation when gaming or watching videos without your fingers blocking the display.. The power button on the right of the handset also falls nicely under thumb when held in your right hand, or finger when in your left hand, and it’s enhanced by the inclusion of a fingerprint scanner built into the key, allowing you to unlock the phone without entering a pin, pattern or password.. We found it was fast at unlocking most of the time, but every now and then we’d have to have a second attempt to get it to register.. It’s worth noting that previous fingerprint-reading Sony handsets have dropped the digit scanner tech for their US models, so there’s no guarantee that if/when the Xperia XZ Premium hits the US it’ll have the feature.. The top and bottom edges of the XZ Premium are metal, and we’d have liked to have seen this finish extend up the sides of the phone, as it would have provided a better look and feel in the hand. On the base of the handset there’s a USB-C port while on top there’s a headphone jack – which will please those who have. watched in horror as Motorola and Apple removed it from their phones.. Another positive with the Xperia XZ Premium is its IP68 dust and water resistance, which means it’ll survive a dip in the bath and heavy rain – just don’t go deep-sea diving. The IP protection only affords the phone protection up to depths of 1 meter in fresh water.. Something else that's slightly disappointing is the SIM and microSD flap and tray. The plastic insert feels fragile, plus it only has space for the microSD card. The separate SIM tray (which is under the same flap) requires you to dig a nail into the side of the phone and tease it out.. For many this will be an operation they'll only need to perform a couple of times, but the plastic flap feels like it could prove a weak link in the water-resistant chain if you’re someone who swaps microSD cards on a regular basis.. Lined up alongside its peers the Sony Xperia XZ Premium doesn’t quite pull off the same flagship finesse – and even more affordable handsets, such as the OnePlus 3T and Honor 8 , have arguably smarter finishes.. While the design of the Sony Xperia XZ Premium may not set it apart, its screen is certainly in a league of its own.. Following on from the Xperia Z5 Premium , the XZ Premium is Sony’s second smartphone to boast a 4K display backed up by the firm’s Bravia TV tech – and in most markets it'll be the only phone you’ll find with such a resolution.. That equates to a resolution of 3840 x 2160, which when stretched over 5.46 inches gives you an eye-popping pixel density of 807ppi. To put that in perspective, the beautiful Infinity Display on the Galaxy S8 manages 570ppi, while the LG G6 gives up 564ppi.. You won’t find a sharper screen on another smartphone, and unlike its 4K-toting predecessor you actually get the full resolution all the time. The Z5 Premium would only deliver the full 4K experience when you were watching video of the same resolution, whereas on the new Xperia XZ Premium it’s 3840 x 2160 all the way – from the home screen and browser to the app store and your social media profiles.. There's no option in the settings to reduce the resolution of the display to save processing power and battery life, where as the QHD toting Galaxy S8 does give you the option.. On the Xperia XZ Premium though, we didn't find a need to have the resolution reduced at any point as the battery life was pleasing. You can find out just how well it lasted later on in this review.. The screen panel uses LCD technology, delivering a crisp, clear image; it doesn’t have quite the same pop as the AMOLED displays found on the Galaxy S8, Moto Z and OnePlus 3T, but the Triluminos Display technology does enhance colors over standard LCD panels. This is a screen you’ll still want to ogle.. It also feels a little small, especially now that the 5.7-inch LG G6 and 5.8-inch Samsung Galaxy S8 have started to break new ground when it comes to screen size in 2017.. That said, if you haven’t had the luxury of using those phones yet, you’ll still find the Xperia XZ Premium provides ample space – especially if you’re upgrading from a two-year-old phone.. While it's certainly nice to say your phone packs a 4K resolution, the reality is it offers very little over and above the excellent QHD displays you get on the likes of the Galaxy S8, LG G6 and HTC U11 .. Watch 4K content on the Xperia XZ Premium and it's one of the best visual experiences you can get from a smartphone - but finding that content isn't easy, and there's actually not all that much readily available.. Sony will argue that the XZ Premium is future proofed, as 4K content will only increase in availability - which is true - but at this screen size QHD usually more than suffices..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2450 MHz, Kryo 280 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit.

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

Sony Xperia XZ Premium Performance and Battery Life. Exceptionally robust and reliable design and finish. 4K HDR display better than the previous model. Motion Eye camera with slow-motion video. A year and a half after the release of the first smartphone with a 4K display, Xperia Z5 Premium, Sony is back on the market with the new Xperia XZ Premium. Apart from this record-breaking resolution, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium also includes several features that make it one of the most advanced smartphones in the world. While the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 is quite impressive, the first thing you’ll notice is the outstanding finish, which combines plastic and metal with Gorilla Glass 5 for an exceptional feel in your hand. The Motion Eye camera with the option of recording slow-motion video with 960 fps and a 3230 mAh battery supporting QuickCharge 3.0 are just icing on the cake.. The Sony Xperia XZ Premium is the manufacturer’s first phone which uses Gorilla Glass 5 as the main material to define its finish. The entire front and rear surfaces are covered in this type of shatter-resistant glass. The handset’s left and right sides are curved and crafted out of plastic but Sony’s designers managed to execute this in a way to make things absolutely unnoticeable for users; we couldn’t feel the change in materials when we ran our fingers along the side of the phone. Of course, plastic sides contribute to the phone’s resilience if it should be dropped, just like the metal upper and bottom sides, which are perfectly flat.. The smooth surfaces might make the device feel a bit unsafe when held in hand — as if it might slip from your grasp — but the mass of the Xperia XZ Premium(almost 200 grams) gives it a touch of robustness. Our only objection to the design is that it’s extremely similar to its predecessors.. Sony has been sticking to its guns for years, based on the very squared shape and minimalistic hidden keys on the right side. No matter how elegant and modern this solution is, it has become rather difficult to differentiate between individual Xperia models. It is time for something new, even though a touch of the old is a good thing in the sense that this handset is dust and water resistant.. The screen bezels are very large, but this is one of the design details where Sony has been ignoring the market trends. In addition, the control keys (Home, Back and Tasks) are located on the display itself (despite the large bezels providing more than enough room for physical buttons) and are a part of the user interface. This means you’ll only find perforations for the stereo speakers and microphone featured in the front (above and under the display), along with the front-facing camera and the Sony logo.. The rear side includes a perfectly flat camera lens and flash. The left side reveals a nano-SIM and microSD cards drawer. The right side includes the Power key with the volume controls above it and the physical camera activation and shooting key below it. The bottom side reveals the USB Type-C connector and the primary microphone, while the upper side holds the 3.5-mm audio jack and the secondary microphone. The phone’s dimensions are fairly large: 156 x 77 x 7.9 mm (6.14 x 3.03 x 0.32 in) and almost math those of iPhone 7 Plus.. The 4K display is one of the most interesting technical features of Sony Xperia XZ Premium, even though we had the opportunity of previously seeing this resolution on Xperia Z5 Premium a year and a half ago. Of course, the new display is much better compared to the old one, in every way. It finally boasts a pleasant, even impressive contrast and realistically saturated colors. To be precise, the screen has 3840 x 2160 pixels, which gives it a record pixel density of 807 ppi on a 5.46-inch diagonal (the older model featured 806 ppi because the screen had a 5.5-inch diagonal). In relation to the phone’s entire front surface, the display takes up 68.4 percent of the surface.. Another positive feature about the image quality is that the display supports HDR (High Dynamic Range) technology as well, a current must have in the world of flagship TV sets, which is why we noticed added levels of details in highlights and shadows along with richer contrast, which can be spotted with the naked eye.. This is the first mobile phone in the world to offer something like this. Deep black and pure white tones, good display brightness and realistic color interpretation result in a more enjoyable experience when using the phone in direct sunlight. Apple and Samsung’s flagships are arguably a shade better in terms of visibility in direct sunlight, but Sony is now well above average with Xperia XZ Premium.. When it comes to 4K resolution, it is fully used only for playing videos with the same resolution. When working with the basic user interface or applications, the device upscales the native resolution to 4K. When we are talking about everyday work, the difference in sharpness compared to Full HD is not evident on a screen of this size, but Sony did not plan to improve image sharpness with 4K resolution. The main application for the huge number of pixels is VR. Improved VR is almost certainly why Sony decided the Snapdragon 835 is a necessity for this handset. If you don’t care about using your phone as a VR headset the hardware is still useful for streaming HDR 4K video onto larger 4K displays.. Sony’s current top model comes with Qualcomm’s octa-core Snapdragon 835 and has a 1 GBps LTE modem, a speed for which global carriers are just starting to upgrade their networks. What is somewhat disappointing is the fact that Xperia XZ Premium comes with “just” 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of memory storage – a higher level is expected from this year’s flagships – while plenty of rivals ran the extra mile by offering phones with 6 GB of RAM. However, 4 GB is still more than enough for current applications and games, especially with Adreno 540 graphics. Thus, Sony’s phone scores equally impressive results on synthetic benchmarks and in everyday work, where it is fully fluid in any situation. GeekBench 4 displays a score of 5840 for Xperia XZ Premium for multi-core measuring, while it scored 1940 for single-core, which approximately matches Samsung Galaxy S8’s score.. The 3230 mAh battery reveals above average battery life – since 4K resolution is rarely used and S835 is a well-optimized chipset. The phone will have no problems providing reliability until late at night, even with intense use, and it will still be running the next day with average use. It also has USB Type-C connector which supports QuickCharge 3.0 technology and Sony’s Qnovo technology that extends the battery’s life as the device predicts how long the user will keep it charging so that it can adjust the recharge rate of its capacity in the best possible manner.. The Xperia XZ Premium is equipped with a 19-mega pixel camera, but distributed across a fairly large 1/2.3-inch sensor. To be precise, this is the biggest sensor among all this year’s flagship models and is a significant advantage that this model features. Its lens features a bright f/2.0 aperture but that is less impressive than most rival top-range models. Interestingly enough, Sony has omitted the sensor’s optical stabilization. It relies on electronic 5-axis stabilization, i.e. Such stabilization type is particularly powerful while recording videos.. Yet another headline feature when it comes to shooting video clips is super slow motion recording, based on 960 fps, which no other smartphone in the world can do at the time of this writing. In order to focus, Sony relies on a combined approach which includes a phase detection sensor and laser auto focus. Speaking about its ability to focus, the XZ Premium is one of only few smartphones with a dedicated shooting key. Just like on cameras, the key has two levels of pressure sensitivity and can be pressed half way down in order to focus on an object and then all the way down to capture the image. The front camera has the same aperture as the rear-facing one and a whole bunch of megapixels – 13 to be precise.. The camera software is well organized lacks certain options like enhanced depth-of-field (selective focus) for portraits. The manual settings mode is also limited, because the ISO option is hidden in the deeper menu, while the aperture and shutter speed cannot be controlled separately. The application does not even support recording in RAW format in this mode either.. Despite limited manual control, the images are among the best ones when it comes to this year’s flagship phones. The level of sharpness, visible details and lack of noise are above average. Sony still applies a default level of post-processing via software that “touches up” photographs – especially those taken during the night in poor lighting conditions – losing details as it removes noise, but this is acceptable with a fairly high resolution because there’s still plenty of detail.. The front includes a 13-mega pixel sensor, also with f/2.0 and a wider angle with 22 mm of focal length.. Sony is trying to make the Xperia XZ Premium interesting for demanding customers by using five key features: 4K HDR display, Snapdragon 835 processor, Motion Eye camera, premium fit and finish, and great battery life with Quick Charge 3.0 capability. It is clear that this model is a technological signpost for the flagships that are yet to come. If trendy gimmicks are added to these specifications – like extending the screen, dual cameras and edges responsive to touch – we get a clear picture of a future smartphone yet to be revealed. Free of such gimmicks, Sony’s new flagship will be one of the most coveted smartphones among developers, content creators and other early adopters..

Update: Android 8.0 Oreo is now rolling out to Sony’s 4K phone. Along with the usual Android Oreo features, you will now benefit from the face-scanning app introduced with the Xperia XZ1 .. This is Sony’s headline phone for 2017 and, as you’d expect,. it comes with all the top specifications. Like Sony’s previous flagship, the Z5 Premium , there’s a 5.5-inch screen with 4K resolution and HDR (with a caveat, mind), and a Snapdragon 835 processor that can give rival handsets such as the Samsung Galaxy S8 , HTC U11 and LG G6 a run for their money.. But where Sony really wants to stand out is with its camera. The headline feature is its 960fps slow-motion capabilities for dramatic videos. This by far eclipses the slow-motion available on other handsets, which typically tops out at 240fps. Unfortunately, this alone isn’t enough to make the Xperia XZ Premium stand out in a competitive crowd.. First to that caveat I’ve just mentioned. While the screen is technically a 3840 x 2160 resolution panel, the vast majority of the time you’ll be looking at an upscaled 1080p version of the Android operating system.. You might rightly be asking why this is the case – and the answer would be battery life. Rendering 4K resolution every waking minute would absolutely decimate battery life, so instead you’ll see native 4K resolution in certain instances: when watching native 4K resolution videos in the pre-installed Sony app, for example.. Support for 4K resolution alongside HDR (10-bit, to boot) is also meant to be available through Amazon Prime Video, but during testing I wasn’t served any suitable content. This was even after getting my hopes up when a notification popped up saying 4K HDR content was available and directing me through how to install the Amazon Prime Video app, which in itself is still a slightly involved process.. But even though the Prime Video app had a section dedicated to content in 4K and HDR, I could never get it to stream in anything but1080p and standard dynamic range. Trying to download the content for offline viewing wouldn’t let me save in 4K/HDR, even though the on-screen prompt offered me the choice of ‘Best’ quality where 1 hour of content would rack up more than 6GB of storage. Even when selecting this, content would still download at 1080p and actually only require a fraction over 1GB of storage space.. Diving into the settings menu and opting for ‘Best’ quality downloads without a prompt still didn’t force 4K downloads. Needless to say, it’s still not quite ready. Still, the almost ridiculous 807ppi pixel density of the screen made light work of showing off my own 4K, non-HDR content shot on a GoPro Hero 5 Black ..

As a phone that supports the HDR standard this means a high top-level brightness, which, even when not displaying HDR content, is still useful for visibility on a bright day outdoors.. Since Sony hasn’t departed from a more conventional 16:9 aspect ratio, the Xperia XZ Premium’s display doesn’t need to use black bars to display apps and videos properly, which is the case on the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8.. While other manufacturers have long moved on to curved edges and rounded corners, Sony has stuck with the same industrial design for its Xperia phones. Put this phone next to the Samsung Galaxy S8, LG G6 or newly revealed HTC U11, and it feels like a relic.. The thick bezels – top and bottom – look dated now, especially next to the bezel-less Galaxy S8, and leave the Xperia XZ Premium feeling just plain boring. You’d be forgiven for not even realising that this is Sony’s latest flagship.. There’s a choice of Deepsea Black, which is the model I was sent in for review, and Luminous Chrome, which is super-shiny and reflective.. The Sony Xperia XZ Premium is probably one of the most uncomfortable phones I’ve held in some time, exacerbated by its large physical size. Attempt to use it one-handed, and you’ll find the corners dig into your palm awkwardly; the top of the screen will be unreachable for anyone without the largest of hands. Every time I reach into my pocket to grab the phone, my hand is met by a sharp corner.. Following a few weeks of use, I’ve come to realise that the actual construction of the phone leaves a lot to be desired.. Suitably premium materials have been used here, such as glass on the front and back, with Gorilla Glass 5 adding some robustness to the screen. However, under close inspection I can see lots of micro-scratches on the front and plenty more on the rear.. The glass rear is incredibly slippery. I’ve lost count of the times the phone has gradually slid off what I assumed was a horizontal surface. Even the slightest angle will cause the phone to slide.. My desk at home is one of those space-saving flip-up desks, which I assume isn’t perfectly level when flipped down; the phone has fallen off it countless times. I haven’t encountered such issues with any other handset I’ve used.. Train tray tables have also posed a problem; the phone even fell off the top of a cup on which I’d casually decided to rest it without any thought.. The Xperia XZ premium is also an extreme fingerprint magnet, looking smudged and greasy practically all the time – unless you obsessively wipe it down.. The edge of the phone is plastic, which is a sensible move in terms of rigidity, but it feels cheap. You’ll find a volume rocker along the right-hand side along with a recessed power button that houses a discreet fingerprint scanner in the style of Sony’s previous flagship phones.. It was generally quick to respond, although not quite as snappy as the fastest standard front or rear fingerprint scanners, perhaps due to having a much smaller surface area on which to take a reading. There isn’t much in it, though, and I didn’t experience any problems unlocking the phone – plus it does make for a more elegant approach.. If you like viewing at-a-glance information from your lockscreen, you might have to get used to pressing the volume button to wake the screen because pressing the power button with a registered finger will just unlock the phone, bypassing the lockscreen altogether.. Look to the bottom of the phone and you’ll find a USB-C port for charging with a 3.5mm jack on the top. There are two schools of thought here, and I’m of those who believe a headphone jack is better placed on the bottom of a handset, but at least wired headphones are an option here without an adapter.. The Xperia XZ Premium is at least IP68 rated, meaning it can withstand being submerged in water to depths of 1.5m for 30 minutes, which is always a welcome and useful feature..

The Sony Xperia XZ Premium goes all in with features that the company dabbled in with recent offerings, making it a worthy consideration for anyone that is willing to overlook the lack of a fingerprint reader and basically non-existent carrier availability in the States..

Itâs been a while since Iâve used an Xperia phone. While Lanh has done a great job reviewing them in the last year or so, I have had the pleasure of using the Xperia XZ Premium for the last couple of weeks. Though we have seen a number of iterations in a short amount of time because of the companyâs tight release schedule, it still feels like returning to an old friend. This year, Sony has returned with a 4K capable display and all of the power that you would expect from the company you donât hear from enough in the States. But does the latest and greatest from Sony stack up against the bevy of phones that we already have in 2017? Letâs find out in this review of the Sony Xperia XZ Premium.. There is no shortage of Xperia devices, especially considering their release schedule over the past couple of years. It is almost as if the company is running out of different combinations of the alphabetâs last few letters. In this case, however, they have decided to add the term âPremiumâ into the mix. Unfortunately, it might not be the absolute best word to use for this phoneâs design.. It is almost as if the company is running out of different combinations of the alphabetâs last few letters. The XZ Premium is definitely a looker, with a glass on glass design that sports a dark blue sheen in our review unit. This translucent color shines beautifully and makes for a very sleek device. However, the glass-all-over design is something that has been tried and true in the Xperia line, making this phone all too familiar especially to Sony fans. It doesnât help that the glass back is a fiend for fingerprints, which smudge up the sheen all too easily after even just a short time of usage.. Though the fingerprints are a regular occurrence with these glass phones, they are going to be even more common as users perform hand gymnastics all around the large device. Sony still doesnât shy away from the large bezels found primarily at the top and bottom of the screen, making the phone taller than it should be – in a year of 18:9 aspect ratios and tall yet narrow displays, it is a bit flabbergasting to see that Sony just doesnât know how to compact their handsets anymore. It makes us opine for the Xperia Compact phones, really.. Despite all this, handling could be a whole lot worse. The flat top and bottom help rest the phone squarely on a balancing pinky (especially since the glossy back doesnât take well to a PopSocket, but thatâs my personal issue) and the rounded sides are good for a nice vice grip to keep the phone from slipping about.. If it did slip, the phone could take a dip in the water without any problems – the Xperia XZ Premium comes with an IP68 rating so that it can keeps water and dust at bay. Sony has opted for an easily removable SIM and SD card tray that doesnât require a tool – however, the SIM tray is a separate piece to this cover and is simply too fiddly for comfort. Below that is the power button that might not be like the large silver power buttons of old, but it is still a defining feature of the latest Xperia – the large and concave button cradles the thumb nicely, but alas does not include the fingerprint reader that other regions will be able to enjoy.. My favorite part of the Xperia XZ Premium design is the dedicated camera button. By far, my favorite part of the Xperia XZ Premium design (and, indeed, Xperias since the beginning of the line itself) is the dedicated camera button that is nestled in the bottom right corner of the phone. Not only does it give an extra way of opening up the camera (just hold down) it functions completely like a proper shutter button complete with a halfway press for triggering focus. It is a small but significant addition that comes in handy for more picture taking situations that you may initially expect. Anyone that has followed my reviews shouldnât be surprised – I am always a fan of extra inputs on smartphones and this is one big point for the XZ Premium.. So the phone might be a bit unwieldy, but that large body compliments what is one of the most powerful display we have so far in a mobile phone. In the previous 4K toting Xperia device, the high resolution was only used when 4K content was detected – in this case, it is all 4K all the time. That comes with one huge caveats, however – and it might not surprise you to know itâs a content issue.. Some of the sharpest rendering that weâve ever seen on a phone display. Before we get to that, letâs get the specifications out of the way. This 5.5 inch display is 3840×2160 in total resolution, making for some of the sharpest rendering that weâve ever seen on a phone display, covered in Gorilla Glass 5. Sony has injected much of its BRAVIA TV technology into this Triluminous display, as well. Those are a few different buzzwords to basically say that the display is pumping out some crazy colors which can be customized rather extensively in the display settings. You can change not only the color gamut mode but also the white balance of the display. The main issue in the display settings is the lack of any always-on or ambient display – this is a feature that has become commonplace for plenty of flagship phones and the lack of this level of screen convenience is noticeable.. But letâs get back to the 4K resolution. For all intents and purposes, having the resolution turned up to 11 at all times makes this screen very enjoyable. There is upscaling that occurs when viewing anything below that high resolution, but that is where the BRAVIA capabilities come into play. Nothing looked overtly pixelated or blown up to the point of distraction. On the flip side, 4K native content looked absolutely wonderful on the Xperia XZ Premium. The issue is that there is so little 4K enabled content out there that the promises of such of a display turn out to be a concept rather than an ultimately essential feature. It takes quite a bit of sleuthing all throughout YouTube and then in Amazon Prime Video to get 4K native content to take advantage of the high powered screen.. That said, one of the most enjoyable experiences Iâve had on the Xperia XZ Premium has been playing Final Fantasy IX for extended periods of time. Sharpness and color in the game have been top notch but there is plenty else powering the experience. The XZ Premium is another Snapdragon 835 enabled phone that comes with 4GB of RAM that is used to good effect mainly because of a slimmer Android skin.. The Android iteration on this phone is one of the smoothest and snappiest that I have used in recent memory. And I mean it – the Android iteration on this phone is one of the smoothest and snappiest that I have used in recent memory. While there are fewer bells and whistles in this version of the operating system, I never had any problems with having a lot of apps open and I already mentioned the great gaming experience. It is also clear that Sony took some liberties with the OS animations, making them very quick so as to give off the feeling of a really speedy user experience.. Unfortunately, there a couple caveats regarding this version of Android on the XZ Premium – it is not only a skin of Android, but enough of a custom build that it has caused a few holes. NFC is included in the hardware stack but when I tried to pay for a few items using Android Pay, it complained that this version of Android is a custom ROM – this is enough to trigger its security features, making Pay inoperable. Quite the bummer when I did all that work just to have to take my wallet out anyway.. I mentioned before the issue with the fingerprint reader – the sad part here is that I got to use it on an Asian unit back during Computex in Taipei, where I found it to work really well. It made perfect sense to wake the phone using the power button, at which point the phone would unlock because it recognized my thumb during the press. There have been a number of reports regarding why the fingerprint reader is again not a part of the western batch of devices , but basically its absence is sorely felt.. As for the rest of the inclusions, the microSD card slot can be used as an extra SIM tray in most markets, bolstering the already included 64GB of onboard storage. In those large bezels that weâve already lamented over lie stereo speakers for a good sound experience that is neither bad nor exceptional – though front facing speakers are always a plus, they donât get very loud and the small grills keep the stereo sound from being stellar.. Listening to anything from game audio to songs to podcasts is a treat. Things change when headphones are plugged in, though – there are so many options for catering the audio experience that listening to anything from game audio to songs to podcasts is a treat. ClearAudio+ returns from previous Xperia editions and adds an easy way of boosting the sound if customizing it little by little is not preferred. There is even optional enhancement to make compressed audio sound more like lossless, called DSEE HX. And to round it all out, noise cancellation is built into the headphone jack when using a compatible headset. There is little to complain about with the audio experience in the Xperia XZ Premium.. My review unit was used on the T-Mobile network without any problems whatsoever. All parties involved with calls were happy with the quality, and no dropped calls were observed. Data was especially great, as well, with LTE+ working to great effect during my time in New York and back home in Los Angeles.. And finally, battery life is about as good as it could be with a 4K capable display. You would think that the XZ Premium would falter in the longevity department because it has to power so many pixels, but in my heavy usage it managed to be just about as good as current flagships touting Quad HD displays. 3.5 hours of SoT on this 3230mAh unit throughout an entire day of high usage is nothing to sneeze at given these circumstances, but it is still just average for the typical userâs workday. Stamina mode is available to dial back some of the high performance in order to keep the battery from conking out too soon, but in those dire moments Quick Charge 3.0 is still on hand to make sure that there is no problem getting the phone topped up whenever required.. The dedicated camera button is not all that I enjoyed about the camera. On the contrary, there has been a lot to like about the high powered optic package. True to form (especially in the most recent Xperia phones), Sony packs in a 19MP sensor that can capture 4K video and super slow motion video at a whopping 960fps.. Everyone is really drooling over the 960fps slow motion video. Letâs talk about what everyone is really drooling over – the 960fps. Before building up to that highest setting, there are a few other modes available, such as recording at 120fps and adding in the slow motion in post, and one-shot super slow motion that takes a 5 second clip straight from the shutter press. The marquee feature is the 720p video recorded at normal speed, at which point the user has to tap the capture button at âthe right momentâ in order to initiate the high frame rate. Itâs not easy to find the perfect moment, but when you do, the results can be incredible. Just remember to use it in basically just broad daylight, as this mode is terrible in even mediocre lighting.. On the topic of video, I used the Xperia XZ Premium as basically a vlogging camera during a couple days in Taipei and for plenty of other clips since then. Recording at 1080p yielded videos with good detail and enjoyable colors, but recording at 4K would yield even better results especially when they are finally rendered out in 1080.. Which brings me to one of my main issues regarding the Xperia camera software – switching modes. There is a Manual mode that allows for a lot of finite control over the shot, and it is easy to get to that mode and video by swiping on the viewfinder. My main gripe is that the 4K video recording isnât a setting in Video Mode, but rather a mode itself in the extra selection area. Having to move over to the extra modes just for a 4K video adds too much time to what should be a quicker process for a vlogger-type like myself.. But overall the video experience has been quite good, and the same can be said for picture taking. Superior Auto is a great go-to place to get the best possible shot given the scene, and tapping on any portion of the viewfinder to focus the camera track that portion of the subject to mostly proper effect. While it is possible to customize the settings and shot using the Manual Mode (for forcing certain toggles like HDR), the Superior Auto is very reliable and yields the right photo most of the time.. Pictures get a great amount of detail given the 19MP packed in, but color and exposure are also where they should be. Colors can use a little extra punch from time to time, but there were hardly any pictures that I was unhappy with. In some broad daylight shots, the entire photo seemed to be a little overexposed, though – this more than likely due to my tapping a darker area for focus, which the exposure compensation had to account for. But in lower light, the XZ Premium camera is only really hindered by the slower shutter speed that needs to compensate for the f/2.0 aperture. A slower shutter speed makes most small movements blur the photo just enough to have to redo the shot – this might be the only situation where the dedicated camera button is a bit of a hindrance, as well as the move to keep stabilization electronic and not optical.. Portraits also get a little less love due to that slightly high aperture. There will be less of a depth-of-field bokeh effect compared other phones like the Samsung Galaxy S8, as a result. But when the detail is as high as it is, this is a small trade off. The same goes for the front facing camera, which is also plenty powerful at 13MP – it is a good performer without too many bells and whistles compared to its rear facing counterpart.. As the top manufacturer of the worldâs most common smartphone camera sensors, it is good to see that Sony is using their own hardware to good effect. It has taken a little while for them to get the software right, but in the XZ Premium there is very little to gripe about – Superior Auto is solid, settings are abundant, and video is fun to use.. And finally for the software, a lighter edition of Android comes in the XZ Premium, especially when compared to LG and Samsung counterparts. There are few extras that are in oneâs face off the bat, as the homescreens are simple, even use an app drawer button still, and use Google Now as the companion homescreen on the left. The main addition is a quick device-wide search function that is easily found when swiping down anywhere but the notification dropdown. Speaking of, the dropdown is also super familiar, with no significant additions even in the quick toggles.. Sonyâs own applications, however, fall into a rather common trap of redundancy against Googleâs own ecosystem. The Xperia lounge brings users to a portal where Sony will push a lot of content your way, whether it be 4K video or applications that are supposedly âXperia exclusives,â but many of this content is available in other ways and the exclusives are more like add-ons for some of the already Play Store ready equivalents. There is a Movie Creator which can come in handy if you wish to edit videos while mobile. But where there are a few issues are with apps like the Photos and Videos duo – these two separate the different pieces of content on the phone, captured on the camera or not, and feel a little unnecessary when Google Photos is already built in. And a News app by Sony isnât a bad idea, but Google Now is an intrinsic part of the already complete user interface.. We give Sony credit for not taking too many liberties with the Android software on the Xperia XZ Premium, though the rather common head scratching that accompanies a lot of software experiences is present here, as well. As I mentioned before, the software has been properly tweaked to be really fast, quickly animated, and it is lightweight enough to provide a breezy experience. Though this custom ROM for the West sacrifices the fingerprint reader and even Android Pay support, these are annoyances that we understand are not deal-breakers.. The Sony Xperia XZ Premium will not be widely distributed on US carriers, which has been a thorn in the side of Sonyâs presence in the States for a long time now. However, it is available for $799 on e-commerce channels for unlocked editions, and this includes places like Amazon and even Best Buy. For a 4K display, water resistance, a good camera, and even a dual-SIM slot, itâs a tad impressive that Sony keeps the XZ Premium competitively priced against the likes of current Samsung and LG flagships.. Sony has done a good job of keeping up with the competition. And so, there you have it – the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. I have to say, it is really refreshing to come back to the Sony Xperia line after having such fond memories of the many that I reviewed in my earlier days here at Android Authority. And Sony has done a good job of keeping up with the competition – when you look purely at the phone in a vacuum. In the States, the lack of a fingerprint reader is a sore point that many will point out, but there are a lot else to love. A solid, even if all-too-familiar design quite literally makes it shine and a 4K display on a phone is a wonderful addition despite its lack of overall usefulness.. Itâs a matter of give and take with the Xperia XZ Premium, but for anyone that is a fan of Sony, this is a worthy upgrade from the previous edition – unless those six months are a little too short of a time for you to drop $800. For everyone else, this will hardly be a reason to think of Sony as a major player in the West – but you owe it to yourself to at least be aware of Sony and how their step-by-step evolutions might one day influence the rest of the market..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Sony Xperia XZ Premium (2017) review:. A superphone with super slo-mo and a super blah look. The Good The Sony Xperia XZ Premium's awesome screen, supercharged processor and unique slow-motion video mode rightly earn this phone its premium name.. The Bad This is the same design premium Sony phones have used for years and it's starting to feel old and boring. The limited camera interface makes the phone feel crude. The fingerprint reader is turned off in the US.. The Bottom Line The Sony Xperia XZ Premium is a powerhouse of a phone, but it's looking tired against today's rivals, making it tough to justify the cost.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Shiny, but still needs a polish. Life is fun in slow motion. Sony's XZ Premium flagship has just about everything you could ask for from a top-end phone. A 4K display, insanely powerful processor and a unique super-slow motion camera all make this handset great.. And yet I'm not completely smitten.. Beyond the headline-grabbing spec list, the XZ Premium needs more refinement to justify a Galaxy S8 -bothering price of £649 in the UK. In the US, the XZ Premium will cost $800 when it goes on sale June 19 with Amazon and Best Buy. While Sony has said the phone will be available in Australia, it's yet to announce pricing. For reference though, that UK price converts to about AU$1,090.. With a list of specs to trouble the biggest smartphone players, Sony had the recipe for a truly superb flagship phone here. It suffers from an overall lack of finesse, however -- most notably in the same-old-same-old design, which is in dire need of an update. If you care about looks, this XZ Premium simply falls short of its rivals. And its stand-out feature, a super-slow-motion mode that Sony does better than any other phone rival, while intriguing, isn't enough to completely smooth over the phone's other camera and design flaws.. There's no question that the XZ Premium is a great phone overall, but competition at this price is fierce. The Samsung Galaxy S8, which costs the same, offers a more refined experience and won't leave you feeling like you've spent all your money on last year's hardware. (Scroll to the end for more comparisons with top phones .). The Xperia XZ Premium's mix of glass and metal fits the "flagship" bill nicely and the shiny chrome back stands out from the crowd (plus, it doubles as a handy mirror). But its overall look is tired. The angular, monolithic design has barely changed in the last few generations so we're still left with a thick bezel around the screen, making it unnecessarily chunky to hold.. With Samsung continuing to refine the sleek, curving edges of its Galaxy S8, it's really time for Sony to retire the XZ Premium's overused aesthetic and try something more up-to-date.. It's waterproof, which is good, but it still uses a rubberised flap to cover the SIM and microSD slot, which is annoying. You'll have to make extra sure it's pushed right in before you go near the pool.. Tired design aside, this phone does have plenty to shout about. The 4K display (3,840x2,160-pixel) is pin-sharp, extremely bright and has colours vivid enough to melt out your corneas. The Snapdragon 835 octa-core processor is extremely powerful, handling demanding mobile gaming and photo editing without hesitation. There's NFC and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner for Android Pay contactless payments too (frustratingly, this is turned off for the US), and it comes with a decent 64GB of storage as standard.. A new addition -- and the phone's best, most unique trick -- is the slow-motion video function. There's slo-mo and then there's slo-mo. Sony's phone turns it from a feature common to all phones into something really special. While the iPhone 7 ( $679.99 at Amazon.com ) shoots at 240 frames per second, the XZ Premium tops that with 960 fps. Even mundane things like a common London pigeon taking flight look fascinating when you watch them back at a super-slow pace.. I've had a lot of fun playing with the function, but that too needs some work. You capture slow motion video by pressing record to start recording at normal speed, then pressing again when you want to capture a quick burst (roughly about a second in real time) of slow motion. You can only take a short burst of super-slow-motion, and it's usually trial-and-error in getting the timing right.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News.

Sony Xperia XZ Premium review: $799 of lust ... Sony gets more right than ever before, but continues to have a few key stumbles that keep it from being in the conversation in the U.S.. Sony's march of alphabet soup phone names continues on with the Xperia XZ Premium, and as you'd expect from such a name this one's all-out high-end. It has the specs and features to match the flagship competition released in 2017, plus undeniably unique hardware design and a few extra tricks up its sleeve.. And despite Sony's continued floundering in the U.S. high-end market — relying on its mid-rangers to provide any glimmer of hope in sales growth — the Xperia XZ Premium is launching here with an ever-so-Sony price of $799. With a price tag like that, the Sony has to nail everything if it's going to win over buyers who rarely break the $700 point — particularly for a brand they haven't likely bought a phone from in some time.. See how it all comes together in our complete Sony Xperia XZ Premium review.. I (Andrew Martonik) have been using a U.S. unlocked Xperia XZ Premium for one week in the greater Seattle, WA area on T-Mobile. The phone arrived on Android 7.1.1 (45.0.A.1.219) with the April 1, 2017 security patch and was not updated during the course of review. The phone was provided to Android Central for review by Sony.. Sony Xperia XZ Premium Hardware. Sony's phones really are something else. It has gone well beyond the several iterative takes on "Omni-Balance" to a fresh design that feels new while clearly still having those deep Sony design roots that make it unmistakably a Sony phone. At 156 x 77 x 7.9 mm it's large considering its 5.5-inch display, and at 195g it's downright heavy. For a sense of scale, it's a couple millimeters larger than the HTC U11 , and a hair smaller than the LG V20 — that's big.. You don't need to read the dimensions to know it's a big phone.. You didn't need to read the dimensions to know it's big — just look at a photo or pick it up. Sony's longstanding "don't really care about ergonomics" attitude toward design is still here, and that starts with large bezels on both ends of the display and barely-rounded corners. The sides are comfortably curved and the buttons are in just the right places, but the perfectly flat back mixes with the tall frame and heavy weight to give you a phone that's a literal handful.. It's not rational, but I adore the overall design of the Xperia XZ Premium.. But for all of those illogically large dimensions and hand-unfriendly details, I adore the overall design of the Xperia XZ Premium. It's not rational, I know, but Sony's designs are so iconic, so unique that I am just drawn to them. The blocky corners, the symmetry and balance of the design, and the perfect fit-and-finish all appeal to me. The heft and feel of the phone absolutely match the price tag. Yes the Gorilla Glass 5 back is "reflective af," as Daniel Bader originally put it back at MWC 2017 (especially the "chrome" model), but it looks great to me — particularly in this handsome "Deepsea Black" color with hints of blue and green in it.. At the same time, I know Sony's designs are also polarizing: I feel like everyone I show a Sony phone to is either enamored with it or appalled. I'm in the former camp, and Sony's mobile designers are obviously proud of what they do — but this doesn't seem to be a design that appeals to a wide enough audience.. Now, the main attraction: that nice 4K resolution 5.5-inch display. It's Sony's second 4K display, but this time around it also includes HDR support — but in general day-to-day use, the important thing is the screen looks great. It still exhibits some of the generic LCD downsides like increased glare in sunlight and less-than-perfect blacks compared to AMOLED, but that aside I'm super happy with its overall tuning. The resolution makes everything look pristine, and the colors, brightness and viewing angles are great as well.. Sony is one of the last manufacturers offering straight-up dual front-facing speakers in what it calls "S-Force Front Surround." The benefits are simple: the speakers are facing toward you, therefore you get a better sound experience. The speakers do indeed sound good, and there's a far lower chance you'll inadvertently block them like bottom-firing speakers, but they don't get quite as loud as I would like — falling beneath the HTC U11 's new BoomSound setup. Thankfully the dual openings haven't compromised its waterproof rating, which stands at IP68.. With Sony's heritage in sound quality there's of course a 3.5 mm headphone jack here, too, which sadly is becoming something I actually have to point out in a review as a positive. Sony talks a lot about its audio tuning on its website , including its high-res output, automatic headphone adjustments and compatibility with its Digital Noise Cancelling headphones. But I'm hardly an audiophile — it all sounds just fine to me with any headphones I've plugged in.. Sony Xperia XZ Premium Software and experience. I quite enjoy Sony's take on Android, mostly because the company seems to be a good steward of Google's vision for the platform and doesn't want to mess about with its underpinnings. In the past couple of generations Sony's software additions have boiled down to a different lock screen, a few icon changes and some pre-installed apps — everything else is pretty much what you get from Google in Android 7.1 Nougat .. Sony's launcher is effectively a lightly themed stock Android launcher, even going so far as to integrate the Google Now feed on the leftmost pane, though it hasn't quite jumped up to speed with the more modern Pixel-style app drawer or long-press shortcuts for apps — I would expect that to come soon enough. Sony subtly themes many of its own apps — contacts, phone, etc. — and also includes a handful of bloat-ish ones — News, AVG protect, Xperia Lounge, etc. — that you can disable or uninstall. Nothing out of the ordinary here.. The place Sony has most substantially changed the phone is in the settings, where it has peppered in quite a few extra options, tweaks and intelligent controls for things like storage, battery and system management. None of it is in your face or gets in your way, though, and this is nowhere near the piles of settings you'd see on a Galaxy S8. It's all thoughtfully sorted and slots right into the typical Android settings framework.. Performance is great, and consistent as well.. The Xperia XZ Premium gives you industry matching specs , with a Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It all adds up to superlative performance, which is extra impressive considering that 4K resolution it's pushing around. Much like its software isn't far removed from stock, its performance isn't far off from a Nexus or Pixel.. Everything I did on the phone absolutely flew without any slowdown or hiccup, with great app performance and consistency. Subtle things like touch response and scrolling speed were also spot-on. That's great to see because coming in I was worried that the 4K display resolution was going to be a drain here — but it doesn't seem to be. Now I'm not entirely sure, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if Sony was doing some sort of scaling down to a lower resolution in some instances to both make things look good and keep fluidity up. But for what it's worth, I could never tell when that was happening.. Sony continues to emphasize battery life, and with a 3230mAh battery, a power-efficient Snapdragon 835 processor and some optimization the XZ Premium is a great performer. I wasn't worried about my battery running out a single time on the phone, and ranged from ending lazy weekend days with over 50% battery to more hectic weekdays with still 25% left in the tank. That means I never got anywhere near needing the "stamina" mode to extend it artificially, nor did I ever have anxiety about remaining battery in the evening with outings planned for the night.. Sony continues to make battery life a priority — the XZ Premium lasts a long time.. I think the most impressive part about the XZ Premium's battery performance is just how consistent it was throughout the day. There were no deep drop-offs during heavy use — it pretty consistently drained so matter what I did with it. Sony gives you a bit of a humblebrag meter under the battery icon with the notification quick settings expanded that estimates hours of life remaining — it so frequently estimates over 10 hours left, even when at something like 30% battery, that it seems like it's lying ... Clever charging technology inside the phone — branded "Qnovo" for whatever reason — also aims to prolong the life of the battery cell inside by keeping the phone from sitting on a charger at 100% overnight. Instead, it watches when you typically charge your phone and keeps it around 90% charge, only to bring it up to 100% before you normally unplug. Little things like that are really nice to see implemented seamlessly and smartly.. Yup, we know Sony still can't sell a phone in the U.S. It has to do with some sort of contractual obligation it made (or backed out on) that legally prevents it from shipping the feature. And yes, the Xperia XZ Premium sold everywhere else in the world has a fingerprint sensor built into that side-mounted home button.. It sucks, really bad, to not have such a standard feature on this $799 phone — particularly when you can get it on a $199 phone — but there's nothing Sony can do right now. It's probably a deal breaker for most of us, and it was surely a pain point in reviewing the XZ Premium — more so for securely accessing my password vault and banking apps than necessarily unlocking the phone. We all hope that this ends soon, but right now we're stuck.. Sony Xperia XZ Premium Camera. In 2017, Sony's actually made the decision to lower its camera sensor resolution to 19MP, which has increased pixel size to 1.22-microns for improved low-light performance; the lens remains a relatively standard f/2.0 aperture. Sony continues to go on about its "5 axis" image stabilization, but this is still all-digital stabilization and not hardware-based stabilization (OIS).. Sony has finally got the camera speed up to a flagship level.. This new camera arrangement does have some tricks up its sleeve including a hybrid auto focus system, predictive photo capture and and anti-distortion shutter. They're all focused on trying to capture photos as quickly as possible, but also give you the shot you wanted rather than the exact frame you captured when the shutter was pressed.. Sony has finally, absolutely, consistently figured out the speed aspect of its camera app. The Xperia XZ Premium camera opens in a flash, focuses quickly and captures immediately every single time. It's finally a camera experience that doesn't feel like it's laboring every time you use it, which is something other companies figured out a couple generations ago. The camera app itself is still fine, though not perfect: it still wants to separate functions out oddly into different modes (like 3 shooting modes for different video types, why?), and lock everything down if you shoot in "superior auto" mode, leaving you to go to Manual to tweak something as small as toggling on HDR.. Sony's insistence that its superior auto mode is The Best Thing Ever™ is unfortunately an incorrect assumption. When shooting in this mode, the software is super aggressive about switching into different scenes and swapping around settings ... that feel like they're incorrect for what you're shooting. Far too often the XZ Premium didn't expose properly or didn't apply HDR, leaving you with a dull and uninteresting shot. The biggest issue, though, was edge detection and sharpening: in superior auto, all fine detail is aggressively over-sharpened and ground down to a mush. Photos so often looked unnaturally smooth to a point where it put me off right away.. Shooting in Manual mode, you can get great photos — but Sony still isn't competing enough.. Things are fortunately much better when shooting in manual mode, where the over-sharpening was dramatically reduced. Even when not needing to tweak any settings, I would 100% recommend shooting in manual mode simply to keep the camera from over-thinking (incorrectly) how it processed shots. I took some really good photos with the XZ Premium in manual mode, but even still it had bouts of inconsistency in the way it metered or was able to properly expose for the scene — even HDR couldn't make up for some scenes that were just too dark. Late at night, the lack of OIS combined with the weak processing to result in just decent photos.. The one thing that truly frustrates me about Sony's camera strategy is that it throws so many brands at you — Motion Eye, Exmor RS, G Lens, BIONZ, SteadyShot and probably more — that you're lulled into thinking this must be the best camera ever. But the proof is in the pudding, and Sony's phones still aren't up to speed with what the flagship competition can do — instead, you get a camera befitting a phone that costs $300 less.. I don't often do breakouts to talk about the video performance of phones unless it really stands out one way or another. With the Xperia XZ Premium, Sony has a really awesome feature it's touting, 960 fps slow-motion video, that I just had to spend time with.. Super-slow-motion is a neat trick, but still requires far too much compromise.. From the start, it's tough to initially figure out how to use the slow-motion mode. We're so used to "typical" slow-motion video at 120 or 240 fps where we just press record after switching into that mode, and it slows it down. With something as high frame rate as 960 fps, you can only record a very short burst (about 0.15 second) that's then slowed down. You can choose to record that second of 960 fps video in the middle of a regular 30 fps video, or on its own with a single tap. Because it's such a short duration, it really takes some practice to nail the moment when you want to capture slow motion.. Then there's the issue of how far the camera has to crop in on the sensor to record the slow motion. It already crops in tightly to shoot 1080p video at 30 fps, then a bit more for 60 fps, and even more for 4K — but it crops in really far to record 960 fps. In order to capture a full scene as you'd expect, you have to take a few full steps back from where you would normally be to take a photo holding your phone. With the lack of OIS on the camera, cropping in this far introduces lots of motion from hand shake as well — you need to steady yourself or use a tripod for great results. Remember you're also only getting 720p output here, so there isn't any wiggle room.. The results are amazing to see out of a phone. So long as you get the hang of recording in order to capture things that are moving fast enough to actually look good in super-slow-motion, it's something you just don't get anywhere else. The issue is the handful of compromises involved with capturing such slow video that make it more of a novelty in the end rather than a truly differentiating feature.. Sony Xperia XZ Premium Bottom line. In many ways, I'm a huge fan of the Xperia XZ Premium. It isn't slick, small, light or ergonomic, but it isn't trying to be — Sony's hardware design is unique, beautiful and stands out from every other smartphone available today, and that's why I love it. Beyond the design, the Xperia XZ Premium gets a lot of the flagship features down: a really nice display, fast and consistent performance, and all of the right internal specs. The battery life, which is always a top feature for today's smartphone buyers, is top-of-the-pack.. The issue, as is so often the case with Sony's phones, is twofold: it's too expensive, and there are a couple of head-scratcher shortcomings.. The Xperia XZ Premium is the absolute top-of-the-line smartphone for the company, and therefore has a retail price of $799. Outside of a Galaxy S8+ or iPhone 7 Plus , people just don't often pay that kind of money for a phone. And they particularly don't pay that much for a phone that in the U.S. doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, and still sports a camera that doesn't get anywhere near the competition.. At a lower price, in a market where it's okay to miss a couple of features but still provide a good value in order to sell, that would be manageable. But at $799, people expect to get just about everything — and even though the Xperia XZ Premium gets so close, it's missing just enough that it's instead an exceptionally tough sell in the U.S..

The Sony Xperia XZ Premium is a powerful unlocked phone that combines a vivid 4K HDR display with the latest Snapdragon processor and strong audio capabilities, but falls short in other areas.. It's hard to take your eyes off of the unlocked Xperia XZ Premium ($799.99). It's the first phone with a 4K HDR display, packing a staggering number of pixels into a 5.5-inch panel. It also has a powerful Snapdragon 835 processor, high-resolution audio, stereo speakers, and a waterproof build. That said, the overall design is a bit dated compared with competing flagships that pare down the body while expanding screen size, and the phone's fingerprint sensor is disabled for US users. There's also little 4K HDR content available to take advantage of that gorgeous screen. The XZ Premium offers a lot to like, but the Samsung Galaxy S8 remains a more well-rounded alternative and our Editors' Choice.. The Xperia XZ Premium doesn't surprise in terms of design. Available in black, chrome (silver), and pink, it's practically identical to the Xperia XZ , with the same rectangular shape, rounded sides, and unfashionably large bezel. In an era of phones with edge-to-edge displays like the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6, the XZ Premium looks dated (and it is, if you look even further back to phones like 2013's Xperia ZL ). That said, it has a nice premium, high-quality look and feel thanks to matching panes of Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back, giving it a highly polished, mirror-like finish. It picks up fingerprints pretty easily though.. View All 7 Photos in Gallery. The phone measures 6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 6.9 ounces. You can almost use it with one hand due to the friendly, rounded sides, but the sizable bezel makes it just too big to reach across with your thumb. The tall, narrow Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces) and LG G6 (5.9 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.8 ounces) are both easier to use.. A dual-SIM and microSD card slot are accessible through a flap on the left side. There's also a USB-C charging port that supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0. A fingerprint sensor is integrated with the power button on the right, but it isn't activated in the US, which is disappointing, as even entry-level phones are starting to include this feature. Also on the right is a mushy volume rocker and a camera shutter key. A 3.5mm headphone jack is on top, and there's a pair of stereo speakers on the front.. The XZ Premium is IP65/68 waterproof, meaning it can withstand immersion in up to five feet of water for 30 minutes. It worked fine after being fully immersed in a bowl.. Forget about what the XZ Premium looks like, you're here for the display. It's the world's first 5.5-inch 4K (3,840-by-2,160) HDR IPS display on a smartphone. If you haven't yet done the math, that's a staggering 807 pixels per inch. It's by far the sharpest panel we've ever seen on a phone, beating out the Quad HD Galaxy S8 (570ppi) and G6 (565ppi). Text and graphics are incredibly vivid, but to some extent it's overkill. There are very few instances in which you can truly distinguish between 4K and Quad HD, at least with a screen this size. Most of the time the phone is simply rendering upscaled 1080p. There's also no option for you to up or downscale resolution, unlike the S8.. As for HDR, it gives the phone deep blacks, rich whites, better contrast, and more vivid colors. But it only works with compatible content, which is still limited, though we'll likely start seeing more of it as more phones support the standard.. The XZ Premium is available unlocked and supports LTE bands 1/2/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/19/20/26/28/29/32/38/39/40/41, for use on GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile. During our testing in midtown Manhattan, we experienced solid network connectivity on T-Mobile, recording a top download speed of 11.41Mbps, which is similar to other phones we've tested on the network recently. The phone supports Cat 16 LTE with 4x4 MIMO, allowing it to achieve gigabit download speeds once those networks roll out. Additional connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi and NFC.. Transmissions are clear and voices sound natural. Earpiece volume is good and noise cancellation effectively blots out the vast majority of background noise with only rare instances of crackling from wind .. The XZ Premium supports high-resolution audio with ALAC, DSD, FLAC, and LPCM file formats. The DSEE HX protocol enhances the quality of compressed music files by restoring high-range sound and employing digital noise cancellation. I tested the feature with a pair of Sennheiser HD630VB headphones and was impressed with the uniformly crisp highs, mids, and lows the phone produced. Details really came though, and bass was deep and rich without being overblown.. Bluetooth users aren't left out in the cold. The phone supports Bluetooth 5.0, and aptX and LDAC codecs, both of which enhance audio quality with compatible headphones like the Sony MDR-1000X. Bluetooth 5.0 isn't supported on any headphones yet, but it'll let you stream audio to more than one pair at a time, improve quality, and extend range.. The one disappointing aspect to the audio experience is speaker quality. Despite having stereo speakers, I found audio to be flat and tinny at the highest volume. It wasn't as room-filling as other phones with dual speakers like the ZTE Axon 7 , and was barely audible over the sound of a nearby fan.. The XZ Premium packs plenty of power under the hood with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. Because it's running apps at 1080p, it performs exceedingly well on benchmark tests despite having a 4K display. On the AnTuTu benchmark (a measure of overall system performance), it scores 172,667, a bit higher than the Galaxy S8 which has the same chipset (158,266), and head and shoulders above the Snapdragon 821-powered LG G6 (136,907). If you downscale the S8 to 1080p, the results are closer (163,756), but the XZ Premium still pulls ahead because of its mostly stock UI.. We've reached the point where flagship phones and even midrange ones like the Moto G5 Plus can run apps with nary a stutter, so the XZ Premium with 4GB of RAM has no problem. It can handle plenty of multitasking as well as high-end games like Injustice 2 and GTA: San Andreas.. See How We Test Cell Phones. The phone clocked just 4 hours in our rundown test, which streams full-screen video over LTE with screen brightness set to maximum. That's less than the Galaxy S8 (5 hours, 35 minutes) and the G6 (5 hours, 57 minutes).. A revamped Smart Stamina mode optimizes power by learning usage habits and turning off Wi-Fi and other features you may not be using at certain times of the day. Qnovo, meanwhile, manages charging cycles to lengthen the lifespan of your battery, allowing fast charging when you first plug in, then trickle charging as you get closer to full. These features are difficult to measure in our video test and may result in better battery life for everyday usage.. The 19-megapixel camera on the back is packed with features. For starters, it has the same RGB and IR sensors as the Xperia XZ that improve color reproduction and focus speed respectively. There's also a CMOS sensor with phase detection autofocus that improves low-light shooting. Finally, you have Motion Eye, a memory-embedded sensor that immediately processes images to minimize distortion and reduce post-processing time, a feature you also find on Sony's a9 full-frame mirrorless camera.. The result of all this hardware? The Xperia XZ Premium comes within a hair of matching the Samsung Galaxy S8 in image quality, which we consider the top camera phone on the market right now.. Picture quality is strong outdoors and in good lighting, which can be expected from any flagship phone these days. The real test comes with low-light performance. We took a variety of test shots under various lighting conditions, some on a cloudy day, some indoors, and others under irregular lighting, which you can see in the images below.. Overall, the Galaxy S8 edges out the XZ Premium, showing more detail like individual veins and crinkles in leaves, and more nuance in shadows. Color reproduction is good, though the Premium tints green a shade or two. Noise reduction on the S8 is a bit better, though in the case of some indoor shots (such as the Red Mecha), the S8 blurred a bit. The XZ Premium has manual controls, so with some tweaking of ISO and shutter speed, you can match the low-light performance of the S8.. One of the features I had the most fun testing is slow-motion recording. The XZ Premium is capable of shooting video at a ridiculous 960fps. It only works well in good lighting and shoots in bursts of six seconds, but when it works, it results in some very cool video, as you can see below.. 1080p recording at 60fps and 4K at 30fps is clear and stable. The latter can cause the phone to warm up, though we didn't encounter any overheating. The 13-megapixel front camera takes crisp selfies and is great for video chats.. In terms of software, you get Android 7.1.1 Nougat with Sony's custom user interface running on top. It's not a heavy UI layer, and aside from some minor visual and animation changes, it'll be familiar to most Android users. Sony incorporates Xperia Actions with various smart features for event notifications, scheduling, and daily briefings. At the time of testing, Xperia Actions wasn't available.. You'll find Amazon, AVG Protection, Facebook, Lifelog, Lounge, Movie Creator, PlayStation, Sketch, Spotify, Video & TV Side View, and What's New preinstalled. None of the apps can be deleted, only disabled. Out of 64GB of total storage, you're left with 47.37GB, which is ample for apps, photos, and video. You can always add a microSD card if you need more space.. At $800, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium is one of the costliest flagship phones you can buy. In terms of hardware, it matches most of its rivals with smooth, fast performance, excellent camera quality, and high-resolution audio. It also has the sharpest display of any smartphone available. But it's held back by a bezel-heavy design that makes the phone look outdated and feel unwieldy compared with the sleek Samsung Galaxy S8. It's also missing a fingerprint sensor and won't work on Sprint or Verizon. And while the 4K HDR display is impressive, right now it feels a bit useless due to the paucity of content available. The Galaxy S8 offers largely similar features on all the main carriers for a few dollars less, making it out Editors' Choice. If you want to save some money, the upcoming OnePlus 5 looks like a promising alternative.. Bottom Line: The Sony Xperia XZ Premium is a powerful unlocked phone that combines a vivid 4K HDR display with the latest Snapdragon processor and strong audio capabilities, but falls short in other areas..

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Sony Xperia XZ Premium in Deepsea Black. Big-screen mobiles are all the rage. Just take a look back at the iPhone 4s and Samsung Galaxy SII – don’t they seem impossibly tiny?. Sony’s latest has a display that matches the Apple iPhone 7S for size, 5.5 inches, and has the latest Android software, just like the Samsung Galaxy S8. The new handset is on sale for $799.99 from Amazon and Best Buy.. In terms of pixels per inch, Sony blows every other phone out of the water. This is a 4K display, with 3840 x 2160 pixels, that’s a phenomenal 802 pixels per inch (ppi). Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus has exactly half that because it’s a Full HD screen with 401ppi (1920 x 1080 pixels). Actually, there’s one other phone with the same resolution as this new handset, the previous 4K screener from Sony, the Xperia Z5 Premium from 2015. Ther Samsung Galaxy S8 is pretty high-resolution but nowhere near this. It's 1440 x 2960 pixels, which is 570ppi.. Sony has put a screen this hi-res into a smartphone so you can watch video in the super-high resolution of 4K, also known as UHD, on your phone. Like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6, this is a screen capable of displaying HDR video, though those rival screens aren’t 4K. As you’ll know, HDR or High Dynamic Range is capable of displaying detail in bright, sunlit skies and deep, dark shadows at the same time.. Playback of 4K HDR content on the Sony Xperia XZ Premium looks astonishing: rich, smooth and remarkably detailed. There’s a great side effect to this high-resolution display, too: even the smallest text is pin-sharp here so reading everything from emails to ebooks is excellent.. But I have to say, it calls into question whether a 5.5-inch screen, as opposed to a 55-inch one on a TV, say, is really the best place to watch 4K content. Though the display is the same size on both the Xperia XZ Premium and the iPhone 7 Plus, Sony wins out with slightly smaller measurements in its height and width. Mind you, Apple’s phone is slimmer, 0.29in against 0.31in. This makes it a win for Apple as in a phone this size, it’s the thickness where your hands feel the disparity most keenly. Sony’s phone is slightly lighter, though in practice you can barely feel the difference.. The Samsung Galaxy S8 has a 5.8in display but is noticeably smaller because the screen ratio is different, of which more later.. Here are the exact specifications, if you’re interested.. Sony Xperia XZ Premium, Samsung Galaxy S8, Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Sony Xperia XZ Premium: 6.14 x 3.03 x 0.31 in (156 x 77 x 7.9 mm), weight 6.88oz (195g).. Samsung Galaxy S8: 5.86 x 2.68 x 0.31 in (148.9 x 68.1 x 8 mm), weight 5.47oz, (155g).. Apple iPhone 7 Plus: 6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 in (158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm), weight 6.63oz (188g).. The compactness of the Galaxy S8 is partly down to the screen ratio that the phone has: 18.5:9 instead of the traditional 16:9 of TVs and many smartphones. It certainly works to squeeze more screen into a narrower, more hand-friendly shape, but to some eyes it looks a bit, well, thin. And for video playback, it’s not a perfect fit. The Sony has the regular 16:9 ratio that makes movies and programming play perfectly with less need for black borders, which at this size screen makes quite a difference.. The Sony Xperia design language is attractive. The top and bottom edges of the Xperia XZ Premium are flat – you could stand the phone on its base if you want to, which is handy for video calls, say. It’s more easily recognizable than many me-too smartphones and stands out from the crowd. Whether you like the look or not is subjective, obviously.. Sony Xperia XZ Premium in Luminous Chrome: it's a mirror.. 6 Oh my, but it’s shiny. It’s available in several colours including Deepsea Black and Luminous Chrome. Honestly, if you choose the chrome version, you need never carry a pocket mirror again to check your make-up or your contact lenses. The downside to this shine is that fingerprints show up quickly and require regular polishing on your jeans leg to see them off. Mind you, the same can be levelled at the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the jet black version of the iPhone 7 Plus.. Against the pixel count on the Samsung Galaxy S8, the Sony wins thanks to its 19-megapixel sensor compared to the 12-megapixel sensor on the Samsung. It’s also a slightly larger sensor than the others, and the bigger the sensor the better the pixels.. Still, some other phones, such as the iPhone 7 Plus, have two cameras on the rear, in that case so you can achieve a 2x magnification by switching from one lens to the other without losing resolution.. In practice, the Sony camera is good, even in lowish light. And there’s another advantage which most other smartphones don’t have: a physical shutter button. Press this down when the phone is in standby and the camera app opens. There is a shortcut on the Samsung to achieve the same end, but a physical button has another benefit. When you half-press it, it starts the focusing process.. 8 And the camera has a unique stand-out extra. It’s capable of (briefly) recording video at 960 frames per second, way more than rivals can manage. It’s really a bit of a novelty and may not be the deciding factor when you choose your next mobile, but it’s very, very cool.. 9 The processor is up with the best, the OS is the latest. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chip is what powers this phone and it’s a real performer, on a par with the Samsung Galaxy S8. Which is what you’d expect from a phone of this price and prominence, of course. It has the latest version of Android software, 7.1.1, which helps, too, and that’s ahead of the 7.0 software with which the S8 launched. As smartphones go, it’s nippy and responsive, not least thanks to the 4GB of RAM on board.. Every new phone that’s released offers new features which may see you using the handset more, so it needs to have an even better battery to get it through the day in confidence. First, it lasts well anyway, and the Stamina mode which turns off certain background functions to save juice is excellent. It even has a smart notification which can warn you if you’re likely to run out of power before you recharge again.. Then there’s the battery care system which recharges in a different way when it’s nearly full and which, Sony says, will mean the battery will perform better over the full lifespan of the product, which can only be a good thing..

A fast shutter helps reduce distortion when capturing fast-moving objects. The Sony Exmor RS for Mobile image sensor launches in half a second and features a unique stacked structure that allows for even more light gathering ability than backside-illuminated image sensors, leading to less noise and better low light ability in a more compact size.

Rated 5 out of. From the Experia XA Ultra to the Experia XZ. Due to the great experience with the Experia XA Ultra, I chose to go with the XZ when my Ultra was left in a zip pocket of my pants through the washing machine. The XA Ultra was drowned and toast but the phone came out in great physical condition. It was actually still working until a power cycle. I am very satisfied with the XZ even though the screen is a smidge smaller than the XA Ultra. The battery time is noticeably far better and I considered the Ultra to be great. If you are considering this phone, I believe you will be very appreciative of its features and performance. The feel and look and quality..... Rated 5 out of. This phone for my life style works well, college student/work. I don't use it much, but I do like taking pictures and videos and music here and there. The chrome color is amazing, haven't had any problems with this phone so far. And it's smooth to the touch, no lags either. Hope Sony finds more ways to improve the phone, so it can make it a true competitor with Samsung and Apple.. Rated 5 out of. Excellent phone - 4K video streaming very nice, doesn't overheat and extremely fast with great battery use/life.. Rated 5 out of. Rápido, cámara excelente, pantalla 10 puntos. Rated 5 out of.

Fingerprint recognition not available in the US. Defaults to FullHD screen resolution for anything other than native 4K content. The Sony Xperia XZ Premium has a gorgeous 4K display. Better yet, a 4K HDR display! The latest Snapdragon 835 chipset is pulling the strings and delivering lightning-fast LTE while the Adreno 540 is firing up millions of pixels in a heartbeat. With or without the mirror finish, this is one of the classiest designs around and waterproof, too.. A brand-new 19MP main camera does stunning slow-mo videos at 960fps. There is a 13MP autofocus selfie camera, true stereo speakers and one of the best skins around, the minimalist but feature-rich Xperia launcher.. All that sounds great but we can't miss the fact that while others stretched their screens as much as possible - to the point of them literally spilling over the bezel-less sides - Sony chose to cram extra pixels for a 4K display. While others punched extra holes to fit dual-camera setups, Sony was busy adding an extra memory buffer layer in a high-res sensor for striking slow-mo videos. One thing is clear - Sony is on a different roadmap than everybody else but that doesn't mean their phone is any worse than the rest. It's no secret that only native 4K content can put those eight million pixels to good use, but the good news is that more and more of that content is becoming available.. What's not available, in the US at least, is fingerprint scanning. No, not even the company flagship is getting away with it, and that's a spot on Sony's reputation stateside. There is little anybody can do about it, up to Sony to sort it or move on.. A full disclosure is due: we've never been big fans of the Premium moniker ever since the Z5 Premium came about. It's about as creative and meaningful as Deluxe in a phone's name (we're looking at you Asus!) Let's hope the industry doesn't get to Executive and Superior somewhere down the line. What we can promise is that we won't be holding the name against the XZ Premium. What we're really interested in seeing is whether the phone will make good where it counts.. With that said, the look and feel are a big part of what makes or breaks the smartphone user experience and we are ready to get on with the physical. Camera, features, daylight image quality 9.

(July 2017) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ). The Sony Xperia XZ Premium is an Android smartphone manufactured and marketed by Sony. [3] Part of the Xperia X series, the device was announced to the public along with the Xperia XZs at the annual Mobile World Congress in February 2017. Pre-orders for the Xperia XZ Premium started in Europe on 22 May 2017. [4] The device went on sale in the UK on 2 June 2017 and in the US on 19 June 2017. It serves as the spiritual successor of the Xperia Z5 Premium and is Sony's latest flagship after the Xperia XZ .. The device's highlight features are a 4K HDR ultra high resolution display and its capability of capturing super slow-motion videos at 960 frames per second. 1.1 Design and Build. 1.2 Display and Performance. 1.5 Audio and Connectivity. The Xperia XZ Premium refines the Xperia XZ's "Loop Surface" design. Called "Glass Loop Surface", it consists of a nylon side frame, metal top and bottom edges that together make up the chassis of the phone, and scratch-resistant front and back glass panels made of Corning's Gorilla Glass 5. [7] The top and bottom part of the chassis are flat and diamond-cut along the edge to form a reflective facet. [8] The most defining change in the XZ Premium, as well as the XZ1 , is the placement of the image sensors on the back. It is now placed across the camera lens and slightly off-center, as opposed to being placed longitudinally below the lens like on the XZs. The NFC antenna is at the center part of the rear glass panel, just below the "XPERIA" nameplate. The front of the phone consists of dual front-firing stereo speakers, one on the top bezel and the other on the bottom bezel, along with a 13 MP front camera, ambient light sensor, proximity sensor and notification LED.. The Xperia XZ Premium's dimensions are 156. in) in height, with a width of 77. in) and a depth of 7.9. [9] It has an IP rating of IP68, making it dust proof and water resistant for over 1.5 meters and 30 minutes under water. The device also features a fingerprint sensor embedded into the power button that can be used to unlock the phone and secure it from unauthorized access. This feature, however, is disabled on units sold in the US. The Xperia XZ Premium is the second phone with a 4K (2160p) display, the first one being the Xperia Z5 Premium. But unlike the latter, the Xperia XZ Premium has a 4K HDR display, making it the first smartphone to feature such a display. It is HDR10 compliant, but has no Dolby Vision support. mm) IPS LCD screen has a pixel density of 807 ppi when rendered in 4K resolution and features Sony's TRILUMINOS display and X-Reality for mobile technology.. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (MSM8998), [11] built on 10 nm process technology with 8 custom Kryo 280 processors (4x 2.45 GHz and 4x 1.9 GHz ), 4 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and uses the Adreno 540 for graphics rendering. [12] The device also has an internal storage of 64 GB and comes in single-SIM and dual-SIM versions, with both featuring LTE Cat. 16 with 3x carrier aggregation, a 4x4 MIMO antenna design and a total of 8 antennas. It also has microSD card expansion of up to 256 GB (in a hybrid slot [13] for the dual-SIM variant).. Sony debuted in the Xperia XZs and the XZ Premium the world's first 3-layer stacked image sensor with DRAM for smartphones. [14] Known internally as Sony IMX400 , the new ExmorRS sensor features a RAM chip sandwiched in between the sensor and control circuitry layers which serves as a large and fast buffer to where the sensor can temporarily offload a significant amount of captured data before transferring it to the phone's internal memory for processing. [15] This enables the camera to record super slow-motion videos at 960 fps , at a steady 720p resolution. Recording at super slow motion is limited to 0.18 seconds per buffer, due to limitations.. Officially called Motion Eye , the Xperia XZ Premium has a 19 MP 1/2.3” Exmor RS for mobile sensor with a 1.22 μm pixel pitch, f/2.0 aperture and 25mm wide G Lens. It also features 4K video recording, which supports SteadyShot video stabilization alongside the standard 1080p/30fps and high-speed 1080p/60fps and a 120fps recording in 720p options. The front selfie camera has a 13 megapixel sensor (1/3.06") with 22. mm, f/2.0 lens and 90 degree wide angle lens, same as the Xperia XZ but now features SteadyShot with Intelligent Active Mode (5-axis stabilization ) like on the XZs .. The Xperia XZ Premium has Sony's Triple Image Sensing technology first introduced in the Xperia XZ as standard. It is composed of the Image sensing ( CMOS sensor with PDAF), Distance sensing ( Laser AF sensor ) and Color sensing ( RGBC-IR sensor) systems, featuring a hybrid autofocus that utilizes Phase Detection (PDAF) to lock focus on a subject within 0.03 seconds. It also includes phase and contrast detection along with predictive motion tracking, and a laser autofocus sensor for fast tracking and focus-locking on an object, as well as an RGBC-IR ( R ed G reen B lue C lear- I nfra R ed ) color sensor that assists the white balance function of the camera by providing additional data about the light conditions of the surrounding environment. It also has SteadyShot with Intelligent Auto in addition to the five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization first seen in the Xperia XZ.. The Motion Eye camera also has a new feature called Predictive Capture. When it detects fast-paced movement, the camera automatically captures a maximum of 4 photos before the shutter button is pressed, and lets the user select the best one afterwards. This is done without any user intervention and is possible due to the same built-in RAM chip on the image sensor used in capturing the 960 fps super slow-motion videos.. In November 2017, after receiving user feedback, a software update within the camera features menu was released, titled "Correction for image distortion". The Xperia XZ Premium is powered by a non-removable 3230 mAh battery. Charging and data transfer is handled by a USB-C port with support for USB 3.1. It also has Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0 and Qnovo adaptive charging technology built-in. This allows the device to monitor the cell's electrochemical processes in real time and adjust charging parameters accordingly to minimize cell damage and extend the battery unit's lifespan. [17] It also comes with Battery Care, a Sony proprietary feature, that controls the charging process of the phone by learning and recognizing the user's charging patterns, preventing the phone from damaging the battery's cells from excessive heat due to overcharging. For example, when charging overnight, Battery Care stops the initial charge to 90 percent and then continue charging until full where it left off the next day.. The Xperia XZ Premium comes with a standard 3.5 mm audio jack for plugging in wired headphones. It also has LDAC , an audio coding technology developed by Sony [18] , that enables the transmission of 24bit/96khz High-Resolution (Hi-Res) audio content over Bluetooth at up to 990 kbit/s, three times faster than conventional audio streaming codecs, to compatible audio devices. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 5 with aptX and Low Energy , NFC , dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with 2x2 MIMO antennas, Wi-Fi Direct , MirrorLink , screen casting via Miracast , Google Cast , DLNA , GPS (with A-GPS ), GLONASS , BeiDou and Galileo satellite positioning. The Xperia XZ Premium has no FM radio.. The Sony Xperia XZ Premium launched with the Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system, along with Smart Stamina battery saving modes and Sony's proprietary multimedia apps.

Sony's latest flagship defies expectations with its amazing screen and video skills. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. UI, camera and Super Slow Motion. Multimedia and gaming, performance, storage and battery. SONY HAS TAKEN SOME TIME bringing its new flagship, the Xperia XZ Premium to the market. Announced at Mobile World Congress in February , it's only just landing in June. It's still the only phone on the scene with 960fps slow-mo video, a 4K HDR screen and 1GB download speeds, though, ensuring that even in June, it's cutting-edge.. But are these accolades enough to make the XZ Premium stand out in a crowd of excellent flagship smartphones? Design Boy does this phone look familiar. With a combination metal and glass body, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium looks like a shinier, blown up Xperia XZ. Thanks to Gorilla Glass 5 around the back and front, it's high-gloss and well protected, and with IP68 water and dust resistance, it can be submerged for up to 30 minutes in depths up to 1.5 metres. Interestingly, those are, for the most part, accolades shared by HTC, LG and Samsung's latest flagships, and the iPhone 8 leaks are leaning in that direction too.. Unlike the new Galaxy S8 and LG G6 , though, Sony has opted for the more traditional screen aspect ratio of 16:9. This means that the phone isn't overly long, is plenty wide and will require you to have, at least fairly sizeable hands in order to use it comfortably. Getting specific, the XZ Premium measures in at 156mm tall, 77mm wide and 7.9mm thick. It has a fair amount of bezel going on above and below the screen. These bezels house the front speakers and a high-resolution, 13MP selfie camera. The power button on the right side of the phone also doubles up as a fingerprint scanner and, there's a physical camera button too, with two stage input.. In isolation, the Xperia XZ Premium looks and feels just that - premium. It's well weighted, high-quality and good-looking. Next to the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6, it looks a little dated - but don't discount the in-hand comfort a bit of bezel adds to day to day use. Oh, and one last thing, keep a cleaning cloth with you at all times, or, use a case. Fingerprints are the name of the game on this flagship. Screen With a world-first 4K HDR mobile screen, you really would expect this phone to blow all others out of the water. Not only does it have more pixels than any other, it also supports the new TV tech, HDR video. Let's start with the specs: IPS LCD technology, 5.46in and a resolution of 3840x2160 pixels. This resolution results in a pixel density of 807 pixels-per-inch (ppi). To put it into context, an iPhone 7 Plus has a pixel density of 400ppi, the Huawei P10 Plus clocks in at 540ppi and a Samsung Galaxy S8+ has 531ppi.. Anything above 400ppi delivers sharpness imperceptible pixels to a human eye, so you have to wonder, is doubling it just overkill? For the most part, yes it is. Most apps are drawn at a resolution of Full HD or Quad HD. The bulk of what you're experiencing is therefore likely upscaled. I also couldn't see a benefit in terms of clarity over a Samsung Galaxy S8 or an HTC U11 , phones packing Quad HD displays. Finally, the XZ Premium isn't pushed by Sony as a VR phone, VR being one of the only areas that would benefit from 800+ ppi display.. If the 4K screen on the XZ Premium contributes to additional battery drain, therefore, I for one could have done without it. In defence of Sony's decision though, the fact it does show off 4K footage captured on the device in its native resolution means there's no down-sampling. It's also futureproofed, with Netflix and Amazon Prime video expected to be rolling out streaming 4K movies and TV shows to smartphones imminently. Now we've talked about resolution, let's move onto screen tech, and the XZ Premium's display is a Triluminous IPS panel with Sony's X-Reality Engine giving it a bit of extra oomph. In addition, the HDR video accolade comes into play when watching supported content. It really does make a difference, with HDR content looking punchier, having a more discernible range of darks through to lights and therefore delivering an even more immersive experience. As good as it is, HDR video is currently limited to a handful of streaming titles, making this feature a nice to have, rather than a primary buying motivator. Picture quality on the XZ Premium is also exceptional. In a turn for the books for IPS devices, it doesn't fall short when watched side-by-side with the AMOLED Samsung Galaxy S8+. Specifically, it handles detailed footage and colour gradients noticeably better than Samsung's flagships. While the S8+ introduces colour banding, the pin-sharp XZ Premium retains smooth colour transitions better and also looks a bit more realistically muted. That said, it does look less vibrant and deep, especially when watched in the dark, so there is a trade-off. Additional image controls are also available in the settings, enabling control over white balance and offering a range of modes, from ‘professional', for realistic colours through to ‘Super-vivid mode' for a bit more punch..

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. by Damian M.. Android - Android + Sony - Sony +. 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. Introduction Sony has been among the more prolific smartphone manufacturers over the past few years. Throughout 2016, the Japanese manufacturer unveiled seven new smartphones, and at MWC this year, it introduced four more handsets. The top device in the latter bunch was the Xperia XZ Premium. With the XZ Premium, Sony promises unparalleled experience thanks to its revolutionary camera tech, excellent 5.5-inch 4K display and Qualcomm's latest silicon – the Snapdragon 835. Design That's one big and gorgeous fingerprint magnet. The XZ Premium is a beautiful phone. It comes with a 5.5” display in a rather bulky chassis, but still feels quite comfortable to hold. The body is mostly glass and metal, and it feels satisfyingly solid thanks to its size and weight. There's just one aspect to the Xperia XZ Premium's design that we're not too keen on, and that's its susceptibility to fingerprints, courtesy of its otherwise stunning mirror-like finish. When it comes to the fingerprint scanner, it will be available outside the US only, as expected, and it's embedded in the power button on the right side. The same side of the phone also holds the volume rocker which is placed above the power button and is far more comfortable to use than those of the Xperia XZ and Xperia XZs. The left side of the phone holds only the combined SIM and microSD tray. The bottom houses the USB Type-C port, and the top – the 3.5 mm jack. When you look at the Xperia XZ Premium's front, you see a classic Sony design – bezels that are slightly on the big side, but also give the device a rather stylish formal look. Pair this with the impressive display and the dual front-firing speakers, and you have a truly great-looking handset that certainly catches the eye. Overall, Sony did a great job with the phone's looks. Display A very solid screen, despite being a bit blueish. When it comes to the Sony Xperia XZ Premium's display, it's hard to find something not to like about it. It's a 5.5-inch 4K LCD panel, which makes it plenty crisp in all possible use cases. This includes games, video content, web browsing and what not. That being said, for videos and movies, the difference between a 4K display and a 1080p one would be barely noticeable, unless you really look for it. So, in case you're wondering what the benefits of the 4K panel are, they're most noticeable with VR content, where you will suffer far less quality loss. Bear in mind that Sony doesn't have its own VR platform for smartphones, but you may use the XZ with Google 's Cardboard. We have only one complaint about the panel – its colors are somewhat unrealistic. However, it does feature three display presets that you can choose from to change the way colors are shown – Standard, Super-vivid, and Professional Mode. The first is the default profile the phone comes with, the second obviously over-saturates all colors, and the third is meant to present you with the most realistic colors. That effect, however, is somewhat spoiled by the slight blueish hue of the screen. Thankfully, you can adjust the white balance as well, using the provided sliders under the Display option in the phone's settings, and completely get rid of any unwanted tints.. 6.14 x 3.03 x 0.31 inches. 156 x 77 x 7.9 mm. 6.28 x 2.89 x 0.32 inches. 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1 mm. 5.86 x 2.83 x 0.31 inches. 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm. 6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches. 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright).

Good Job Sony for this awesome phone. (Posts: 5478; Member since: 10 Feb 2012). posted on 16 May 2017, 09:48. Ikr?!! Finally a fair score for a Sony device. Although I got the S8 and I'm loving it so far, the XZP is still my favorite phone of the year. It was just small stuff that I got used to have on my phone that kept with Samsung this year. I just hope reviewers will give this phone enough coverage for it to succeed, as Sony deserves it for the effort they brought with this one.. (Posts: 4589; Member since: 07 Mar 2012). posted on 16 May 2017, 12:51. Tried S8 and S8+ yesterday, compared it to my OP3 and the size impressed me. And as I suspected, the fingerprint scanner will need time to get used to. But Sony here, they did a marvelous job...I'm super stoked with the Super slow mo.. (Posts: 158; Member since: 15 Sep 2014). posted on 17 May 2017, 03:59. yea this Sony Xperia XZ Premium is currently the greatest phone out right now. The only phone that may beat it is the Note 8 and thats only if it is coming with a removable battery as I doubt it will come with a 4k screen, 960p slow motion or the perfect fingerprint sensor placement like this Sony.

Super slow-motion can be hard to time right - this is unique feature and you complained about it? At least it's there - even for 0.2 sec(not as you wrote 0.15);. Cumbersome camera UI - in iPhone 4K video shooting is also different app(not in video settings) but you didn't complain about it? Also it depends from the point of view.. (Posts: 5478; Member since: 10 Feb 2012). posted on 16 May 2017, 10:39. To be fair to PA, everyone is talking about the slow mo feature and how you need lots of tries to get it right.

If you look closely, you'll notice how they have the 960fps feature as a pro, and that the process of taking one is a con ;). posted on 16 May 2017, 11:06. The more ridiculous cons, the better the phone as they couldn't find fault in other aspects.. posted on 16 May 2017, 11:25. Just because iPhone's camera UI is crap doesn't make the Xperia UI better. Sorry, but a camera UI that doesn't even allow HDR in auto mode, let alone auto HDR is a garbage UI..

Actually, the real big cons for me are:. - audio output (how can they build great audio players but put crappy audio in their phones). - lowlight photos (saw some samples, they really really suck. All my life i've been buying sony cameras, love the photo quality.... but their phone photos can be so much better). at least add physical buttons to it. Now its just useless space while the onscreen buttons are also taking up space. I was about to pre-order but lowlight photos and good audio are really important for me..

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. You have to hand it to Sony. Despite having virtually no market share in the US, Europe and China -- even in its native Japan, its market share is only 17.5%, as nearly half of Japan's smartphone-owners default to the iPhone -- the iconic electronic giant still refuses to bow out of the smartphone game. What's more, despite the entire mobile industry trending towards sleek, curvy, slim-bezeled phones, Sony's handsets are still unapologetically, almost defiantly, chunky. Just look at the company's latest, the Xperia XZ Premium ... and those bezels! Sony designers are proud of the. symmetrical, shiny, rectangle design language they crafted years ago (which they've dubbed "Omni-Balance"), they consider their devices a piece of art, and that's that.. The device has a complete symmetrical look front and back.. I respect that, to be honest, considering the myriad of bland faceless Chinese phones I've tested that have seemingly no design language of its own other than "follow what Apple/Samsung are doing." But respect and admiration do not equate. I personally choose to use an unnecessarily large phone in 2017, when there. are phones by LG and Samsung that offer me more screen real estate in a smaller, sleeker package? No.. The XZ Premium is quite pleasing to look at though. The shiny silver review unit I tested effectively doubles as a mirror, and light reflects off the rounded sides and chamfered edges in a very pleasing way. that the top and bottom of the device are completely flat, so that I can stand the phone straight up. The side-mounted fingerprint reader is actually a genius placement -- it can be easily reachable by either hand -- considering fans on Andriod. forums have been stuck in the "front or back?" debate for years. Overall, the phone's hardware craftsmanship is top notch, save for of course, that huge forehead and chin.. You can use the device for a mirror.. The power button on the side doubles as a fingerprint reader.. The internals are mostly top notch, with a Snapdragon 835 processor powering things on 4GB of RAM. as a power user I wish it had at least 6GB (OnePlus spoiled me with its 8GB RAM phone ), but 4GB is still enough for the average user.. However, every phone nowadays need a marketable feature (aka gimmick), and with the XZ Premium it's the 4K LCD display and "Super Slo-Mo" camera mode. The former, while cool, is mostly overkill for now, but the latter works like a charm. I'll get into that camera trick later, let me first explain why the 4K screen. didn't matter to me: simply put, the human eye cannot see the difference in resolution on a small mobile screen. We could tell the difference between 4K resolution and 1080p on a 50-inch TV, but on a 5.5-inch device, the superior pixel density is just about impossible to perceive. As a test I placed my Xiaomi Mi Mix (with a 1080p panel) next to the XZ Premium and played the same 4K video, and I honestly couldn't spot the difference at all. Check out the video I made below.. Sharing Is Caring: China's Smartphone 'Share Economy' Is Booming. doesn't mean the XZ Premium's screen isn't brilliant. It's gorgeous to look at, with vibrant colors, but it isn't noticeably more crisp than a. the way 4K televisions look significantly superior to their 1080p counterparts.. Now, the "Super Slo-Mo" camera, that's a feature worth gushing about. The XZ Premium can shoot slow motion videos at a jaw-dropping 960 frames per second (the iPhone 7 can only shoot at 240). Now, the phone can only shoot at 960 fps for two seconds at a time, and resolution drops to 720p, but the results are a joy to watch. I can see this mode creating many hilarious videos for pet owners or parents with children who participate in sports. Check out the samples I shot below..

This entry was posted in Mobile Review and tagged high-end-phone , mobile , sony .. Sony Xperia XZ Premium: First Sony tested with our new protocols. Posted on September 21, 2017 February 14, 2018 by David Cardinal. 1/2.3-inch 19MP stacked BSI CMOS sensor with 1.22μm pixel size. f/2 aperture lens with 25mm (full- frame equivalent) focal length. ISO up to 12,800 (Photo) and 4,000 (Video). Texture / Detail (68) and Noise (58). The Xperia XZ Premium is Sony’s current flagship smartphone and comes with a 19MP 1/2.3-inch image sensor that is based on Sony’s 3-layer stack technology. for smartphones, allowing for fast readout speeds and a 960 fps slow motion video mode that can record 720p footage. technology reduces the rolling shutter effect in both still images and video. laser-assisted AF, an RGBC-IR sensor for natural color rendering and Sony’s SteadyShot 5-axis digital video stabilization.. For a traditional single-camera design, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium does a good job of capturing both still images and video, but without breaking any new ground or seriously challenging our benchmark leaders. Its poor performance on our new Zoom and Bokeh tests pulls down its overall score. The camera does have several innovative features, however, including a 960 fps mode for super-slow motion videos that help it stand out. On the plus side, the XZ Premium features relatively strong autofocus performance for both photography and video, as well as very good stabilization for video.. The XZ Premium does a good job with exposure in bright light, but suffers somewhat from limited dynamic range and a susceptibility to flare that affects its performance in back-lit or harshly lit scenes. Users will be rewarded with better images if they can get the sun out of the frame as much as possible. XZ Premium images also sometimes suffer from subtle color casts, even in good lighting conditions.. Overall, the XZ Premium does a good job in bright light, with generally good exposures, as long as the lighting is controlled and even, as in this scene.. Outdoors, images sometimes have a slight blue cast, as illustrated in this scene.. Indoor lighting gives the XZ Premium some trouble with exposure, and its limited dynamic range also causes blown-out highlight areas in our high-dynamic-range scenes. Indoor scenes sometimes suffer from slight color shading as well.. The camera underexposed this image, losing detail in the subject.. You can see the slight color shading in the zoomed-in areas of this test scene, shot under 100 Lux tungsten lighting (typical of the light provided by residential incandescent lamps).. Flash photos are adequate, with accurate white balance in flash-only scenes — although under-exposure is an issue. In addition, photos suffered from visible noise and poor detail preservation. Flash exposures are also inconsistent, sometimes varying from frame to frame in low light.. This flash-only scene shows accurate white balance, although the exposure is a little low. If you click through to the full-size version of this image you can see that there are problems with color noise and poor detail preservation.. As illustrated by its overall Video score of 84, the XZ Premium has fairly well-rounded Video performance. In particular, it has effective stabilization and generally good target exposures. However, its video performance is marred by inconsistencies in sharpness when, for example, the user is walking while recording. While walking indoors, white balance can also be inconsistent. In addition, the XZ Premium has a tendency to refocus even when it isn’t needed.. The Sony Xperia XZ Premium achieves an overall Photo score of 82, which is calculated from its sub-scores in tests that examine different aspects of its performance under different lighting conditions. In this section, we’ll take a closer look at these image quality sub-scores.. The XZ Premium does a good job of providing accurate exposures in most cases, although it can underexpose slightly indoors or in low light. Its contrast scores are reduced because it has limited dynamic range compared to some other similar phones.. While the exposure is good in this image, shadow detail is sacrificed because the camera can’t capture the high dynamic range of the scene.. Similarly, the XZ Premium loses some detail in the foliage of this scene, rendering it quite dark.. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus does a better job of preserving the natural color and detail in the same scene.. In general, the XZ Premium does a good job of rendering colors outdoors, although sometimes even outdoor images suffer from a slight color cast. Indoor images often suffer from a slight pink color cast.. There is also a very slight pink cast in some indoor scenes captured with the XZ Premium, such as this one of an interior hallway lit with fluorescent lamps.. Accurate autofocus in good light is one of the strengths of the XZ Premium, giving it quite a good score in this category. In low light, however, only some images in our repeated shooting tests are completely in focus.. When given 2 seconds between defocusing and triggering a shot, the XZ Premium refocuses consistently and accurately. When the interval is reduced to a half-second, in some cases the camera is unable to refocus quickly enough, and the image is captured out of focus.. The XZ Premium suffers from texture rendering irregularities across the visual field, which detracts from overall image quality. This is particularly true in low light. Similarly, noise performance suffers in low light when there is motion in the scene or if the camera moves while being held.. If you click through to the full-size version you’ll see high levels of medium- grain luminance noise.. The XZ Premium suffers from a number of significant image artifacts. The most significant is flare in brightly-lit or back-lit scenes. However, lens shading, ringing , and some distortion also contribute to a low score here.. The XZ Premium has trouble with back-lit scenes, showing up as excessive flare.. The XZ Premium’s flash performance has similar characteristics both when flash is used as the sole light source and when it is mixed with a low level of indoor light. In both cases, exposure is good (although slightly low when flash is the only light), as is the white balance. There is also relatively little light fall-off when the camera’s flash is paired with some ambient light. However, the images suffer from a lack of detail and from strong noise. When flash is the only light source, there is also some visible color shading. Another issue is that exposure varied from frame to frame in our repeated shooting tests.. For outdoor scenes, the relatively high resolution of the main camera helped provide the XZ Premium with solid results. Noise performance is acceptable, but there is some loss of detail. In lower light, though, it didn’t perform as well as phones with larger pixels or faster lenses.. With its small sensor, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium has a relatively large depth of field and it also doesn’t have any computational imaging features to improve the way the image renders out-of-focus areas. So it is not surprising to see that it has a poor Bokeh sub-score.. The Sony Xperia Premium XZ achieves a total Video score of 84. As with the photo scores, this is calculated from the sub-scores it achieves in a number of categories of tests that help define its overall video capabilities, specifically: Exposure and Contrast (73), Color (79), Autofocus (78), Texture (47), Noise (69), Artifacts (80), and Stabilization (87). Of particular note, Video clips show noticeable ringing, and there is some inconsistency in frame rate , as well as some judder , that impacted the Artifacts sub-score.. Sony’s Xperia XZ Premium features a capable smartphone camera that gets the job done — especially in good light — but which doesn’t rise to the heights of the top phones from other manufacturers. In particular, it is sensitive to harsh lighting conditions outdoors, and finicky in low light and indoor situations. Video performance is also competent, but marred by problems with loss of detail. The stacked sensor does allow the XZ Premium to support a novel 960 fps slow-motion mode, but even at 19MP, it doesn’t produce overall better images or video than many other phones with lower or similar-resolution sensors.. Generally good exposure both indoors and outdoors. Accurate autofocus both outdoors and indoors. Very limited flash falloff when mixed with indoor lighting. Good target exposure in most conditions. Accurate and stable white balance outdoors. Slight color casts both indoors and outdoors. Exposure irregularities when using flash mixed with indoor light. Frame-to-frame differences in sharpness when walking. Canon EOS 6D Mark II Sensor Review: Great color and ISO performance. Apple iPhone 8 reviewed: A solid performance upgrade over the iPhone 7. I want to see the pictures. I’ve just started uploading some holiday photos taken under extremes of lighting conditions. Photos are all at the default, auto setting and none have been altered in any way and the camera itself has decided where to set the focus and exposure. I suggest you view these at the iPhone 6+ (5X)setting. Amazing! Thank you for posting your photos.. Is it better than XZ and X Performance?. Finally a proper ranking for Sony device. It’s giving credit where it’s due and also placing phones in their rightful places. I really hope Sony will look at this review and focuses on improving their camera. Even Chinese Phone maker are making better camera phone than Sony’s. Are you really joking? If not then you know nothing about photography!. This review is total BS, and DxOMark has lost ALL credibility with me.. But there is something wrong unprofessional test….. ZenFone 4 Pro camera test please. 1/2.3″ sensor is considerably large for smartphone as it is currently the largest size used nowadays. But yes, it suffer from small pixel size.. Not small pixels, but lack of OIS or any image stabilizer, and a relatively dim lens. If this had 5-axis OIS (like in their Alpha cameras) and a relatively bright f1.8 lens, then the software won’t have to push too hard of noise reduction, and thus low light pictures can make use of lower ISO and slower shutter speed.. In the test scene of the pens, pictures on the table with 100Lux light, why is the full picture shows nice lighting, but first zoomed pictures seems to be all blue and not matching to the full picture at all (even the arrow inside is blue and looks like filtered), so what’s going on there?. Also, why doesn’t you guys make the same shots for every phone so it will be comparable? This review lacks many test shots other models have and photo comparisons with other models.. Samsungnuses displaymate protocols, guess dxo uses apple protocols now. Something wrong seriously, we have to ask them to do it again the test for this phone….. Feels like the guy reviewed it during his lunch break, hence the people eating lunch in the lunch room photo compared to the iPhone review where there was no one there.. Also seems like there’s half the content compared to their other reviews, feels sloppy even tho it took them 4 months to review it.. Yeah actually you have a point... By the way guys, they fixed the blue zoom. When looking at the details of the outdoor scenes especially of the neoclassical architecture the details are better than that of the iphone albeit with slightly more noise. The text on the building show this. I would have liked to have seen more details from the still life image as in reviews of other phones.. Its fake, lol xz premium have best stabilitation of market. those tests show xperia has good stabilization but nothing about the XZP being tested agianst newwer competitiors. but yeah its surprising that the stabilization is not the best.. google pixel 2 blowing all phones out of the water though. sony weakenss is software despite having great sensor.. Absolute garbage, a pathetic review from an Apple fan. The camera works like a Bravia 4k tv, switch it to manual mode and you can twdak the colour settings, preview the image before taking the photo, you can add HDR if you really want to show off. Some of your stats are wildly inaccurate. Go on, be honest, did you use the front facing camera and not the main camera?!! The Z5 Premium had a brilliant camera, this tops that with ease.. This phone has a garbage camera.. Garbage iphone 8 than They have to pay dxomark it. Phone has best camera ever (except Panasonic CM1/CM10), XZ Premium has brilliant cam, lets buy it and try. Photos in this test are recompressed to lower quality. Min 8:00 zZp he kicks Mom’s asskicks his butt for the moment in the front camera. This smartphone have best camera in the World, solo que apple buy score and pole position.. Camera iPhone 8 is a garbage. XZp has weaker speakers, but iPhone have so much metallic sound it sounds like shit…. I have yet to see a good or even average low-light photo from a sony smartphone… “brilliant camera” is just plain wrong.. He is from palo alto lol is a apple fanboy.. To clarify something important, the testing and scoring are done by a team of DxOMark engineers, as is the image analysis. The reviews are designed to provide a way to communicate the scores and some highlights of the reports to readers. The reviewers do not test or score the cameras. There are several articles on the site that describe the very-extensive test protocol, which is the same for every device tested.. You are a troll Apple Fanboy, Xperia xzp have a BEST stabikitation of market and best camera iPhone 8. Leave the photographer, you’re a disgrace to the profession. Dxomark tell iphone 7 best stabilitation than Xperia lol. Dxomark fake and An organization that creates bad information!. Fakedoxmark 84 video??? Mediocre stabilitation? Lol. This site is poor of the reason.. But there’s also something weird, in the beginning they wrote “as well as very good stabilization for video”, just look at the first paragraph. But at the end they wrote “mediocre stabilization”.. Do you guys notice the inconsistency there?. Yeah, iPhone 8+ stabilisation sucks in comparison.. I bet they gave s8 better score for the color. This makes no sense, the S8 got 88 and has a worse Sony lens, yet the XZ Premium which has a better lens gets a worse rating, this is why I don’t trust reviews that much anymore. This review is a joke, compared with the one of iphone 8 , 8 plus and other phone. Reviews should all be made with the same criteria.. This review is about 5 times shorter and without proper photo evidence based explanation, as to iphone 8 review. Furthermore, bokeh and zoom protocol? Why not depth of field, wide angle and slow mo video protocol also then?. I would like to see 360 degrees protocol. It seems to be (not for Apple) standard in many devices.. Make it standard test not just for Iphone standard. Yes that right, I think there is something wrong for Bokeh (Sony also have Background Defocus apps) and Zoom protocol for the test, this is more related to apps, OIS technology and the software processing.. If they change the protocol then most dual camera smartphones will definitely be higher than single camera smartphones like XPERIA XZ PREMIUM. Yes I do agree with you, there is something unfair and something wrong with the test, different situation, different images for Iphone and Sony test here. DxOmark please do proper test once again and let the professional photographer do the test…. Dera Luca, we have designed our DxOMark scoring system with one obsession: develop and implement a robust test protocol which can be accurately repeated time after time, and thus all devices we test are treated the same way. Please find more about our new DxOMark Mobile test protocol here:. XZP camera has serious distortion issue. And that’s a real problem that few acknowledge.. I used XZP now and dont have this issue thank God….. yes, it is because this lens is wide. Technically speaking it is very commen. but we have to admit that its a problem. Actually Sony does provide a background blur mode, it’s called Background Defocus and sits in the camera apps: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonymobile.backgrounddefocus. Any macroshot provides background blur, alias bokeh effect…. Nowhere on their site is it explained how the new protocol measures quality of bokeh, nor is the scoring in any way explained visually in the XZ Premium review. Yes and i used in now into my XZP , the effects is so amazing seriously…. Also, did you guys use the HDR mode for HDR scenes? Or was the test done in Superior Auto?. they are tards, they never heard of anything else but auto.. This site has lost it’s credibility having used xz premium i know what the camera is like and it’s way better than what you have shown in the review and it’s 1000 times better than op 5 which you have given a higher rating the only downside on sony phones is their zoom. I do agree….So bias and unprofessional test….. the Sony Xperia XZ1 ? teste please. XZP make a good job just with a single camera. review is piece of shit, do not trust to this site. Fakedxomark see whit 84 score camera destroy note 8 trollsss. Next vídeos destroy xzp destroy best fake camera dxomark. This just shows how important role software has for how the photos will going to look.. Sony camera hardware always been great but for some weird reason when they do cameras for themself they just can’t compete.. orrible, like usual for sony on mobile. Fakemark xzp destroy note 8 in video. And you only camera 83 score lol. Fakemark do you want the class of photography and video?. Do you even photography ? crappy review.. Looking at the side by side photos of the monument/landmark garden by XZP and iP7+ its obvious to the naked eye that luminosity is quite uniformed across XZP sample which means it’s preserved while in iP7+ sample luminosity is shifting all over the place which means it’s being altered in software post processing phase. On iP7+ saturation of the color of the stone is quite obvious and it looks really tacky and in your face. It has noting to do with preserving the color. Phone cameras are all about software clean up and processing, that’s why manufacturers who put all their guns into retouching for faux effect always get the same pictures no matter where they are shot at. You can take iPhone7 and shoot grass & sky landscape in New Zealand and it will look exactly like grass & sky landscape shot in Ireland because iPhone7 can recognize grass and sky and it will boost the saturation of both blue and green, it will add yellow to the green grass to make it golden and then it will apply the contrast between the land and sky to make a separation. Question is do mobile users have time to process their images or they will settle for the best faux effect to make it look pretty. In Exposure and Contrast, the IP7 photo showed for comparison is actually all overexposed, the XZ photo actually preserves the detail on that scene and this makes me mad.. Second time I’m surprised with DxO. The first was with the LG G6 and now this phone. A lot of people said that a lot of Sony camera problems were gone with this camera (even better thant the XZs with the same sensor). So I don’t know what to think about this review, since I also shot some pictures with this phone and were pleased by the shots!. Sony always maintain own standards, sony never fallows others they fallow sony, samsung using sony lense and one plus 5 also other company’s also sony lense, sony started water resistance, now samsung and iphone released water resistance, sony not released edge screen, see never copy others come to dual camera no comparison to single and dual, give a test about speed performance compared to Samsung and other devices sony xz premium is leading.. Yes that right seriously Sony is not a kind of copy cats like others….. Japanese company always maintain their own standard , in market all the phone look similiar except sony .. FakeMark After rating 94 iphone 8 and trolling xz premium.. and bankrot HTC paid too for rating 90? )). WTF! How a professional review can score give a higher score just for fake bokeh??. DxOmark is now part of Apple’s desperate marketing, DxOmark have lost all credibility.. How much apple pay for you guy?????????????????????. I5s I6 I7 I8 I8 plus. Fuck all test in this web. I can’t believe mark in this web.It so fake about apple product.. Fake news, paid review by Apple. Please DxOMARK do it again the test for Sony XZ Premium in proper way, let the professional photographer do the test. Please make it the standard protocol not Iphone protocol for this test really bias especially for the Bokeh that only provide by Iphone. There is something wrong and unfair with the test with the different situation, different lighting, different images for Iphone and for Sony XZP…. Yes, the new analyst is a fanboy apple, he live palo alto.. One more thing, I suggest please separate for the DUAL LENS protocol and SINGLE LEN protocol for this test to be fair enough. DXoMARK are you seriously FAIR right now with your new protocol test??? Come on everyone here let us ask DxOMARK to do again the test with this Sony XZ Premium. The 960 FPS video, auto capturing, object tracking are more relevant than bokeh in the Iphone I think. Please do not make a joke here come on…. so, 21 september is the new april fools day…. David cardinal the new analyst live in palo alto (usa) and say that dxomark was working this summer in a company of cupertuno.. I am not “the analyst.” I wrote the review based on a great deal of hard work by a very-dedicated and technical team who are analysts. They do all the testing and scoring. And I have never worked in Cupertino, or for any hardware company headquartered in Cupertino. PS I also wrote the original reviews of the U11 and the Pixel, which put them at the top of the scoring charts at the time.. Where’s the full image of the 100 Lux test lab image?. Please changue analyst!! where the latest analysts are, david send him to take photos of lions in the jungle o Better still further, the North Pole has to take photos of the seals. Single camera phones shouldn’t be compared with Dual camera phones. single camera still able to beat dual camera , look at Pixel 2…. DXO mark became very biased now 🙁. Completely understandable but I doubt it’s Sony’s sensor that causes it but its terrible processing which can be fixed with raw and log support which sony doesn’t support. Surprised the lens was only average considering Sony’s reputation with their G lenses. There seems to be a lack of bokeh and zoom tests though, the score is understandable but at least upload some photos of it. Sony will never fix their eternal flaw – algorithms!. Having such a smart sensor, they could not realize a half of the sensor potential.. They only change their sensors, but not their shitty software. I don`t see any reason to change their IMX sensors, because all will be the same, programmers will destroy everything. I read the comments of some XZP owners and they claim that their old Z1 and Z3 are not worse at all, and even in some moments, are better.). This is the main reason why sony has problems with sales. Nobody wants to pay a lot of money, for shitty software (. It seems like here they test only auto mode. Low light shots on manual are way better. Score of stabilization since Z5 was always more than 92 points. XZP does better than XZ or Z5. I have a xzp, and I like its cam.Like the article, the loss of detail is true, but its night shooting is excellent!!. 83 is too low for this amazing cam!!!. Are you serious? did Apple pay u money?? Sony xzp have such an excellent and extreme accurate colours! compare to others company. Why not increase the scores? 83 IS WAY TOO LOW!! i say DXO is fucking biased now, also unfair compare to Dual cam. I’ve always come here when looking for a new phone, or just in general & I’d always agree with what DxO Mark were saying. However, and it’s very sad in a way I have to agree with most of the comments here there is clear bias I hate myself for saying so, but your change in testing protocols is just a convenience. People have been nagging you to test out Apple’s + models since the 6+ came out but you never did, yet now out of the blue you decide to test Apple’s + model, & not only that give it a huge superior score over the competition. I can only assume that you have been approached by Apple & given an incentive for a favourable review of their camera system on the iphones. Can’t you truly see that you are making yourselves look highly suspicious in the manner this has been carried out, the whole change of set up on the website, to the new testing protocols & the decision to test Apple’s + models it’s shocking & beyond belief. And may I say I am not saying that the iphone 8 & 8+ deserve to be top, & I don’t own a Sony phone but it is very suspicious how it’s been done. Very sorry to say I have always come here for good solid unbiased reviews of mobile photography, & always told our huge client base to do the same, but not any more. I won’t be coming here again & we shall be advising our clients the same, a once great website has just become yet another cash for reviews website shameful!!!!. We’re sorry to hear your comments have been blocked and we unfortunately did not see it. Your Disqus record based on a high number of previous flags by other readers and spam mentions may automatically send you message as spams. Back to your point, we would like to tell you that all mobiles we test are treated exactly the same way. We have made our DxOMark scoring system with one strict goal: develop and implement a robust test protocols which can be accurately repeated time after time. “all mobiles we test are treated exactly the same way..”. one has around noon with people, messy room and boxes blocking the windows at the back and the other during the evening with warm sunlight beaming into a clean room.. As skrug points out, this report contradicts itself your statement. Unless you repeat EVERY photo with every smartphone under exactly the same conditions (I guess, being “the reference for image quality” it would benot so difficult for you to achieve), your results are not credible.. Your previous testing method, or maybe the corresponding reports, looked much more scientific than the current one. (By the way, new testing methods producing dramatic changes in the results should automatically turn on a red light: something was/is very wrong). Showing only 11 photos (no sample video!) and not giving the chance to take a look at the whole sample set, as well as having a single graphic of all possible measurements is really untrustworthy. It requires an act of faith in you.. Additionally, this report has had some errors (100 lux zoomed picture not corresponding to full size sample; very good video stabilization in the summary vs. effective stabilization in the Pros vs. mediocre stabilization in the conclusion – all of them have quite a different meaning!), some of which have been addressed by now, which makes it lose any credibility.. Does the zoom test has mean ??. Xperia XZ Premium has wide angle camera.. “Your independent source for image quality benchmarks for phones” said the biased DXOmark. You state that you turn on the bokeh mode for other phones, but that you didn’t do it on the xperia. Why is that? Sony does have their own bokeh mode. HAHAHAHA DxOMARK please go to school again….. This is completely hilarious of just having 83 points… 90 would be the minimum. Almost all other manufacteurs use Sony lenses on their smartphones and they get higher scores and they are not using the latest exmor Imx400.Sony is known to be the best in photography and video capabilities otherwise others wouldn’t ask for their help… Sony isn’t giving the latest exmor to others, some of them are using Exmor IMX 386 or less. Yes its true they have the best camera hardware but the software post processing of the captured images is not as good as other brands like samsung and iphone. Meaning the camera hardware is not functioning in its maximum potential. You mean the oversaturated image that iphone produce is better? Lol. Dxomark retards xzp have a best camera. Why did this article get an ‘htc’ tag instead of ‘sony’ tag?. Beacuse it seems someone made this review in his lunch break.. they have already fixed a mistake in the 100Lux table picture where one of the zooms were all blue and they also added full resolution pictures which they haven’t add before. Seems they have another mistake I haven’t noticed.. I’ve noticed that comparing to other brands, they’ve done this review very disrespectfully.. I want to see the full Res 5 lux image, every other phone it’s available. I also want to see the kitchen reshot with the boxes moved that were put there to block light.. Not fair under the new calculation method!! DXO no more trust worthy. Bias over the smartphone big brands like Samsung and Apple. Why minus than z5 premium?…i don’t know if this is a true review….i have them all and xzp does a better job than z5p…so?. S6 Edge used to be 86, now it is 82. XZP probably would score 87 if they did not change.. El analista es un puto troll de Apple, trabaja en verano para ellos y se ve que se la come a tiempos, es un puto trollaco.. El puto subnormal le pone un 83 y es una camara de 100. Is there any access to the image database, or do we have to trust the criterion of some in theory photography expert, who says that the iPhone 7’s picture is better because of the foliage (pretty decent with the ZP, btw), when the top of the building (esp. the towers), which is undoubtedly the object of interest, is clearly blown out?. Test summary: “…as well as very good stabilization for video.”. Conclusion: “Video performance is also competent, but marred by problems with loss of detail and mediocre stabilization.”. They dont even know what they are saying, i bet google and iphone paid them to make their phone looks better, sony does not care because most of them are still buying sony lense for their phone lol. PLEASE ANYONE HERE DO NOT BELIEVE DXOMARK ANYMORE FROM NOW ON.TOTALLY RUBBISH NEW TEST PROTOCOL FROM DXOMARK 2017. LINK BELOW AS A REAL PROOF:. Dxo says XZ Premium doesnt have any specialised bokeh camera effects, and gives it 20?. Then what is Background defocus effect?!. And With what is this shot from XZ Prem made then?!. You guys have totally lost reputation with this new protocol nonsens.. wtf? 76 for color? i think this phone has one of the best color reproduction camera on a smartphone….i compared it to iphone 8 and galaxy s8 and in the color department it won with a huge advantage….the only problem this camera can have is details in shadows…the stabilization is the best in video mode! weird review….. phone taken by sony xz premium look natrually unlike others brand , but the score even lower then China crap phone 🙁. When will DxO test the SONY XZ1?. maybe 3 months after it’s released. XZ1 not shows new camera level, the same like XZS. Don’t think they will test xz1 , overall same as xz premium. xz1 should be tested becuase it came out with android 8 and the xz1 had new improved algorithms over the xzp.. Look at the photo of the 2 guys eating. I compared this one with the same of Note 8. When you zoom in you see that photo of XZP looks better. Seriously the overall score lower then Xperia X?. I have no idea regarding the score , new Imx400 with 5 axis steady shot…. the score even lower then china crap phone. Now XZP is receiving the 8.0 update and a distortion correction is added along with maybe other improvements. Will DXOMARK update its score accordingly?. Absolute rubbish! What stupid criteria – and totally unbalanced scoring. We have iphone, xz, and v20 dual – Sony destroys the competition hands down. iPhone very good, and v20 extremely controllable. However, reliability, detail and speed best on xz. In comparison to Note 8, iPhone X, iPhone 8, LG V30, Pixel 2XL XPERIA XZ Premium has most natural camera and produces natural and clear colors even in low light without any distortion or fade.. nah google has the best camera out of any smartphone.. Google using sony lense btw, hell most phone using sony lense lmao even iphone. you mean sensor? Many dont use sony lense. Its the software that matters a lot too.. DXOMARK is paid to test cameras and They test them according to their criteria. So not necessarily they are right.. One of the best phone camera on the market – I have ZX1 Compact – Compared pictures with Samsung s8, iPhone8, photos on Sony are more realistic and with Manual Mode – much far from the Samsung and iPhone! Stopped trusting this site.. 84 for video camera! that’s one of the best video camera out there, if not THE best. You guys are either biased to the core, or just not competent at all. People, don’t believe that utter crap this website is spreading, and check phones by yourself. Obviously, that “new protocol” is shady….. This website is utter crap, did other company paid you to get high score?. where is the zoomed photo? this is totally biased inspection,totally biased. 960 fps slow motion video is the unique spesification for the mobile phones, why did you said nothing about this?. Everyone know XZ Premium camera take a perfect shot, one of the best camera in the market now.. I think you should correct that score.. i have a xz premium and i confirm photo in auto mode sucks (all details are gone and image is blurry in low light, i live in rainy paris and it is always low light 🙂 ) – (i have not tried manual)- this is a well deserved bad score (at least for low light).. and not only the default sony camera app sucks but sony limited support for the standard camera2 api ( to prevent third party camera apps from doing a better job ?) because the sensor should be capable of doing much better as sony has had the best sensors on the market for many years. i only bought xz premium because i needed the 4k screen for VR, as soon as samsung or google release a phone with 4k screen, bye bye sony.. I have an XZ premium and a google pixel 2, I just can say Sony do worse at this time. Sony has a very good camera but they didn’t do any kinds of optimization on the software because they are not good at doing this kind of things. This is the best phone before the middle of 2017 but all else Manufacturers update the camera and software super fast. But I still look forward the XZ premium 2 hopefully there is a very big breakthrough on it because there are so many innovations on the cam that no one figures out.. People nowadays didn’t even want to admit the truth. (They didn’t even own the phone though.). XZP’s camera just suck as it can. Compare to other flagship phone, XZP performs like a mid range phone. Way too blurry no matter day or night, over sharpness makes the quality looks so bad. I gave up using the phone as a camera, I just got one of those thin point and shoot and that solved the issue, of course its hard to compare one inch sensor to a phone sensor.. I actually own an XZP and I can clearly vouch for it. In fact I can take some low light shots for which will blow your comparison out of the water.. If Sony would let us have the RAW output of this camera then it would be the best of all phones simply because a RAW DNG file would provide the true sensor output and not a JPEG which is heavily processed by internal software which we all know by now, Sony’s JPEG are awful even in high end system cameras.. You’re right, I think sony of course have the abilities to do that, but they won’t, like Canon, they’re all squeezing the toothpaste, if sony makes their phone’s camera too great, they gonna hit their camera dept. Otherwise, they also makes the phone can’t installed Google Camera app, if we can see IMX400 with HDR+ someday, that would be as awesome as hell. Xperia XZ Premium has Background Defocus which can give the depth effect like selective focus on the Galaxy S8.. You should check this out before give 20 point for Bokeh. Backgorund Defocus doing well like selective focus. Very unprofessional and poorly made review. This gives a bad image of this website.. So many dedicated camera buffs out there..

The Sony Xperia XZ Premium is a powerful unlocked phone that combines a vivid 4K HDR display with the latest Snapdragon processor and strong audio capabilities, but falls short in other areas.. Editor Rating: Good (3.5) Jun 13, 2017. Fingerprint sensor not activated in US.. The Sony Xperia XZ Premium is a powerful unlocked phone that combines a vivid 4K display with the latest Snapdragon processor and strong audio capabilities.. It's hard to take your eyes off of the unlocked Xperia XZ Premium ($799.99). It's the first phone with a 4K HDR display, packing a staggering number of pixels into a 5.5-inch panel. It also has a powerful Snapdragon 835 processor, high-resolution audio, stereo speakers, and a waterproof build. That said, the overall design is a bit dated compared with competing flagships that pare down the body while expanding screen size, and the phone's fingerprint sensor is disabled for US users. There's also little 4K HDR content available to take advantage of that gorgeous screen. The XZ Premium offers a lot to like, but the Samsung Galaxy S8 remains a more well-rounded alternative and our Editors' Choice.. The Xperia XZ Premium doesn't surprise in terms of design. Available in black, chrome (silver), and pink, it's practically identical to the Xperia XZ , with the same rectangular shape, rounded sides, and unfashionably large bezel. In an era of phones with edge-to-edge displays like the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6, the XZ Premium looks dated (and it is, if you look even further back to phones like 2013's Xperia ZL ). That said, it has a nice premium, high-quality look and feel thanks to matching panes of Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back, giving it a highly polished, mirror-like finish. It picks up fingerprints pretty easily though.. View All 7 Photos in Gallery. The phone measures 6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 6.9 ounces. You can almost use it with one hand due to the friendly, rounded sides, but the sizable bezel makes it just too big to reach across with your thumb. The tall, narrow Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces) and LG G6 (5.9 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.8 ounces) are both easier to use.. A dual-SIM and microSD card slot are accessible through a flap on the left side. There's also a USB-C charging port that supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0. A fingerprint sensor is integrated with the power button on the right, but it isn't activated in the US, which is disappointing, as even entry-level phones are starting to include this feature. Also on the right is a mushy volume rocker and a camera shutter key. A 3.5mm headphone jack is on top, and there's a pair of stereo speakers on the front.. The XZ Premium is IP65/68 waterproof, meaning it can withstand immersion in up to five feet of water for 30 minutes. It worked fine after being fully immersed in a bowl.. Forget about what the XZ Premium looks like, you're here for the display. It's the world's first 5.5-inch 4K (3,840-by-2,160) HDR IPS display on a smartphone. If you haven't yet done the math, that's a staggering 807 pixels per inch. It's by far the sharpest panel we've ever seen on a phone, beating out the Quad HD Galaxy S8 (570ppi) and G6 (565ppi). Text and graphics are incredibly vivid, but to some extent it's overkill. There are very few instances in which you can truly distinguish between 4K and Quad HD, at least with a screen this size. Most of the time the phone is simply rendering upscaled 1080p. There's also no option for you to up or downscale resolution, unlike the S8.. As for HDR, it gives the phone deep blacks, rich whites, better contrast, and more vivid colors. But it only works with compatible content, which is still limited, though we'll likely start seeing more of it as more phones support the standard.. The XZ Premium is available unlocked and supports LTE bands 1/2/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/19/20/26/28/29/32/38/39/40/41, for use on GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile. During our testing in midtown Manhattan, we experienced solid network connectivity on T-Mobile, recording a top download speed of 11.41Mbps, which is similar to other phones we've tested on the network recently. The phone supports Cat 16 LTE with 4x4 MIMO, allowing it to achieve gigabit download speeds once those networks roll out. Additional connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi and NFC.. Transmissions are clear and voices sound natural. Earpiece volume is good and noise cancellation effectively blots out the vast majority of background noise with only rare instances of crackling from wind .. The XZ Premium supports high-resolution audio with ALAC, DSD, FLAC, and LPCM file formats. The DSEE HX protocol enhances the quality of compressed music files by restoring high-range sound and employing digital noise cancellation. I tested the feature with a pair of Sennheiser HD630VB headphones and was impressed with the uniformly crisp highs, mids, and lows the phone produced. Details really came though, and bass was deep and rich without being overblown.. Bluetooth users aren't left out in the cold. The phone supports Bluetooth 5.0, and aptX and LDAC codecs, both of which enhance audio quality with compatible headphones like the Sony MDR-1000X. Bluetooth 5.0 isn't supported on any headphones yet, but it'll let you stream audio to more than one pair at a time, improve quality, and extend range.. The one disappointing aspect to the audio experience is speaker quality. Despite having stereo speakers, I found audio to be flat and tinny at the highest volume. It wasn't as room-filling as other phones with dual speakers like the ZTE Axon 7 , and was barely audible over the sound of a nearby fan.. The XZ Premium packs plenty of power under the hood with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. Because it's running apps at 1080p, it performs exceedingly well on benchmark tests despite having a 4K display. On the AnTuTu benchmark (a measure of overall system performance), it scores 172,667, a bit higher than the Galaxy S8 which has the same chipset (158,266), and head and shoulders above the Snapdragon 821-powered LG G6 (136,907). If you downscale the S8 to 1080p, the results are closer (163,756), but the XZ Premium still pulls ahead because of its mostly stock UI.. We've reached the point where flagship phones and even midrange ones like the Moto G5 Plus can run apps with nary a stutter, so the XZ Premium with 4GB of RAM has no problem. It can handle plenty of multitasking as well as high-end games like Injustice 2 and GTA: San Andreas.. See How We Test Cell Phones. The phone clocked just 4 hours in our rundown test, which streams full-screen video over LTE with screen brightness set to maximum. That's less than the Galaxy S8 (5 hours, 35 minutes) and the G6 (5 hours, 57 minutes).. A revamped Smart Stamina mode optimizes power by learning usage habits and turning off Wi-Fi and other features you may not be using at certain times of the day. Qnovo, meanwhile, manages charging cycles to lengthen the lifespan of your battery, allowing fast charging when you first plug in, then trickle charging as you get closer to full. These features are difficult to measure in our video test and may result in better battery life for everyday usage.. The 19-megapixel camera on the back is packed with features. For starters, it has the same RGB and IR sensors as the Xperia XZ that improve color reproduction and focus speed respectively. There's also a CMOS sensor with phase detection autofocus that improves low-light shooting. Finally, you have Motion Eye, a memory-embedded sensor that immediately processes images to minimize distortion and reduce post-processing time, a feature you also find on Sony's a9 full-frame mirrorless camera.. The result of all this hardware? The Xperia XZ Premium comes within a hair of matching the Samsung Galaxy S8 in image quality, which we consider the top camera phone on the market right now.. Picture quality is strong outdoors and in good lighting, which can be expected from any flagship phone these days. The real test comes with low-light performance. We took a variety of test shots under various lighting conditions, some on a cloudy day, some indoors, and others under irregular lighting, which you can see in the images below.. Overall, the Galaxy S8 edges out the XZ Premium, showing more detail like individual veins and crinkles in leaves, and more nuance in shadows. Color reproduction is good, though the Premium tints green a shade or two. Noise reduction on the S8 is a bit better, though in the case of some indoor shots (such as the Red Mecha), the S8 blurred a bit. The XZ Premium has manual controls, so with some tweaking of ISO and shutter speed, you can match the low-light performance of the S8.. One of the features I had the most fun testing is slow-motion recording. The XZ Premium is capable of shooting video at a ridiculous 960fps. It only works well in good lighting and shoots in bursts of six seconds, but when it works, it results in some very cool video, as you can see below.. 1080p recording at 60fps and 4K at 30fps is clear and stable. The latter can cause the phone to warm up, though we didn't encounter any overheating. The 13-megapixel front camera takes crisp selfies and is great for video chats.. In terms of software, you get Android 7.1.1 Nougat with Sony's custom user interface running on top. It's not a heavy UI layer, and aside from some minor visual and animation changes, it'll be familiar to most Android users. Sony incorporates Xperia Actions with various smart features for event notifications, scheduling, and daily briefings. At the time of testing, Xperia Actions wasn't available.. You'll find Amazon, AVG Protection, Facebook, Lifelog, Lounge, Movie Creator, PlayStation, Sketch, Spotify, Video & TV Side View, and What's New preinstalled. None of the apps can be deleted, only disabled. Out of 64GB of total storage, you're left with 47.37GB, which is ample for apps, photos, and video. You can always add a microSD card if you need more space.. At $800, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium is one of the costliest flagship phones you can buy. In terms of hardware, it matches most of its rivals with smooth, fast performance, excellent camera quality, and high-resolution audio. It also has the sharpest display of any smartphone available. But it's held back by a bezel-heavy design that makes the phone look outdated and feel unwieldy compared with the sleek Samsung Galaxy S8. It's also missing a fingerprint sensor and won't work on Sprint or Verizon. And while the 4K HDR display is impressive, right now it feels a bit useless due to the paucity of content available. The Galaxy S8 offers largely similar features on all the main carriers for a few dollars less, making it out Editors' Choice. If you want to save some money, the upcoming OnePlus 5 looks like a promising alternative.. Ajay Kumar is PCMag's Analyst obsessed with all things mobile.

Samsung Galaxy S8 Read our Samsung Galaxy S8 review LG G6 Read our LG G6 review HTC U11 Read our hands on: HTC U11 review. The Sony Xperia XZ Premium is a handset jam-packed full of features, and from its impressive 4K display and huge power under the hood to an excellent camera and solid battery life it has all the core ingredients of a top smartphone.. The price is high, and that means it has some truly tough competition, with the Samsung Galaxy S8 , LG G6 , HTC U11 and iPhone 7 Plus all breathing down its neck, and if you’re looking for a handset which has both style and substance you may find the Xperia XZ Premium a little underwhelming.. It’s by no means ugly, but when you hold it up against its all-metal-and-glass rivals, the chunky bezels and plastic sides don’t quite match up.. The 4K HDR screen is incredible when you find some 4K content to play on it, but for the time being at least there’s still only a handful movies and shows at this resolution.. Unless you’re someone with a passion for 4K, you’ll be more than content with the QHD (2K) screens you get on the rival Android flagships.. If you’re in the market for a high-end smartphone then the Sony Xperia XZ Premium needs to be on your shortlist. It has everything you’d want when paying top dollar for your tech, with its 4K display and slow motion camera two party pieces you can impress your friends with.. Design and style are a matter of opinion, and while Sony’s more industrial design language doesn’t dazzle in the way as Samsung's Infinity Display blending seamlessly into the body of the Galaxy S8 does, it does have a core of fans who enjoy the no-nonsense approach.. If your current phone is a flagship from two years ago or more there are plenty of new features packed into the Xperia XZ Premium to make it a satisfying upgrade.. However, those currently flaunting a flagship from 2016 will see less of an incentive to make the leap, with slightly more incremental upgrades on offer here.. If you're considering getting the Xperia XZ Premium, you may want to hold on. Sony is tipped to launch its successor (the Xperia XZ Premium 2 ) during MWC 2018 at the end of February, so an even better version could be available to you very soon.. If you’re a die-hard Sony fan, the Xperia XZ Premium is the phone you’ve been waiting for. If you fall into this camp, buy it. It delivers on display, camera, power and battery life, making it one of the best flagships around – it's the best Sony smartphone you can lay your hands on.. However, if you’re more manufacturer-agnostic you may want to consider your options at this price point before taking the plunge.. If you do opt for the Xperia XZ Premium you won’t be disappointed, as you get an awful lot of bang for your buck, and we’d really recommend the Super Slow Motion feature – it’s a lot of fun.. The Xperia XZ Premium isn’t the only feature-packed flagship on the market, so here’s a trio of high-end rivals that’ll ensure Sony’s new flag-bearer doesn’t have an easy ride.. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is currently our best phone in the world, and any flagship smartphone will be compared to its 5.8-inch Infinity Display, futuristic design and supremely capable camera.. Head to head, there’s not a lot to choose between the battery life, performance and cameras on these two phones, but the Samsung just edges out Sony when it comes to display and design.. That is, of course, if you’re not a 4K HDR fan – if you are then the Sony Xperia XZ Premium is the phone for you.. The Galaxy S8 still has the Sony beat with a more comprehensive overall package, but the Xperia XZ Premium isn’t far behind.. The LG G6 boasts a larger display than the XZ Premium (5.7-inch vs 5.46-inch), but also a lower resolution, with a 2K offering rather than the Sony's 4K panel.. Its slender bezels mean the G6 is similar in size to the Sony, and it has a more premium finish with an all-metal-and-glass body – no plastic sides in sight here.. It's now quite as powerful under the hood, but round the back you get two cameras. One is a standard 13MP snapper while the other is a 13MP wide-angle lens, allowing you to get more of your scene into the shot.. The HTC U11 has its own party trick, with 'squeezable' sides that allow you to launch apps and perform actions – such as snapping a picture – without touching the screen.. It’s a novel way to use your phone, and while your squeezes are limited to a quick grip or a longer hold, this feature does help it stand out.. The premium glass and metal body looks great, even if it is a fingerprint magnet, and like its flagship rivals the HTC U11 has plenty of power under the hood, and an impressive camera round the back..
