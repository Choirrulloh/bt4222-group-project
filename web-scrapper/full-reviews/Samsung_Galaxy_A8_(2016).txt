more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 32 GB + MicroSD. Release date: Oct 1, 2016. View all photos (14). Thin body, measuring less than 7.5mm/0.3inches (0.28 inches). The Samsung Galaxy A8 (2016) is based on the same platform as last year’s Samsung Galaxy S6. This means that we get a Samsung Exynos 7420 chipset paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of integrated storage. The Galaxy A8 (2016) also makes use of the same 16MP primary shooter. On the front of the handset, an 8MP secondary shooter is there to take care of selfies. The display of the phone is a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED panel running at a resolution of 1080 by 1920 pixels. Other specs include a Samsung Pay-ready fingerprint sensor integrated with the physical home button on the front, Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, as well as a 3300mAh battery.. OS: Android (6.0), Samsung TouchWiz UI. Dimensions: 6.17 x 3.02 x 0.28 inches (156.6 x 76.8 x 7.2 mm). Weight: 6.42 oz (182 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Materials: Main body: Metal; Accents: Glass. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, CMOS image sensor. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Octa-core, 2100 MHz, ARM Cortex-A57 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 14 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 22.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better!

Samsung Galaxy A8 (2016) goes official in Korea with all-metal build, large battery. Adrian Diaconescu September 30, 2016 4:11 am. We’re only one or two months away from the introduction of the 2017 Galaxy A lineup , but the 2016 A8 edition has literally just rolled out in Samsung’s homeland… with the general specifications of a 2015 flagship phone.. Pretty confusing stuff, though certainly not unusual for a company that seems to cope with scandal and drama by stress-releasing mid-ranger after mid-ranger. Of course, the Samsung Galaxy A8 (2016) is not just any mid-end Android soldier, taking design cues from its predecessor and the C family while borrowing Galaxy S6 or Note 5 ’s internals.. Under the 5.7-incher’s hood, you’ll find a powerful octa-core Exynos 7420 processor, paired with a respectable 3GB RAM, up from 2 on the 2015 A8, and backed by a large 3,300 mAh battery that even tops the 3,000 capacity of Note 5’s cell.. The Galaxy A8 (2016) probably trumps last year’s hero devices in the photography department as well, matching their 16MP rear cam prowess, but upping the selfie ante to 8 megapixels. Then again, the “Always On” display is hardly a standout this time around, capping off at Full HD resolution, and compared to the original A8, the second-gen feels a tad bulky, at 182 grams and a 7.2mm profile.. Obviously running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out the box, the new all-metal beast also supports Samsung Pay with a home button-baked fingerprint scanner, and reportedly costs north of $500 in Korea, which sure isn’t pretty. Let’s hope it doesn’t tend to blow up .. Source: SK Telecom Via: SamMobile. Android , Galaxy A8 , Galaxy A8 (2016) , News , Samsung. Android , Galaxy A8 , Galaxy A8 (2016) , News , Samsung. Adrian has had an insatiable passion for writing since he was in school and found himself writing philosophical essays about the meaning of life and the differences between light and dark beer. Later, he realized this was pretty much his only marketable skill, so he first created a personal blog (in Romanian) and then discovered his true calling, which is writing about all things tech (in English)..

Mobiles / Samsung Mobile Phones / Samsung Galaxy A8 2016 Price in India. User Visits: 56 Compare. Samsung launched Galaxy A series of smartphones back in 2014 with Galaxy Alpha, to provide metal-clad devices to its users. Since then the handset line up came a long way and has seen two generations. This series marked the beginning of metal design for Samsung and rest is all history. Samsung is now all set to launch the third generation of this handset soon and it happens to be one of the most anticipated devices. Here is a brief overview of the handset for those who want to get their hands on this one.. Grace UX : Samsung was quite quick to realize that one of the major drawback in its handset was the laggy and bloated Touchwiz UI. The handset maker then took to the drawing board and came up with an all new debloated and optimised, Grace UX, which first appeared on the Galaxy Note 5. This same UX will also feature on the upcoming Galaxy A8 (2016) as well.. Good Cameras : One of the USP of any Samsung Galaxy smartphone is the camera that it sports on front and back panels. Samsung Galaxy A8 (2016) is no exception as it comes with a 16 Megapixels shooter on the rear panel and 8 Megapixels on the front. The picture quality from these is expected to be pretty impressive since it is the same camera that featured on its flagship Galaxy S6 device.. Fingerprint Scanner : The fingerprint scanner on the Samsung handsets are pretty accurate and quick, which is a good pro in our books. Samsung Galaxy A8 (2016) also comes with the same home button cum fingerprint scanner on the front panel.. Good Display with Always On : Samsung has equipped this handset with a massive 5.7-inch display that boasts of a full HD resolution. Combine the crisp resolution with the AMOLED panel and the display is quite a winner. Also, it comes with the Always On feature that keeps a part of the display on with notifications, clock and other important info, which is quite handy.. Might be slightly expensive : Galaxy A series of handsets have always been expensive and this one will not be an exception. However, spending to the excess of INR 35,000 when you have same build quality and much better specifications in budget segment makes no sense..

By Sidharth Rang | 22 Feb 2016. Samsung Galaxy A 8 has made a whole new segment for phones in the 25 g to 30 g range, not only has it set a benchmark with his camera for pictures, but even battery life which refuses to die down easily, the brilliance of the screen of 5.7 inch and the amazing video clarity , which delights one and all and the best feature was comparing selfies taken via the I phone 6 plus to the A8 and A8 kills it. Only feature which phone companies should consider is a front flash for selfies.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 3 out of 3 people found this review helpful. By Sameer Meena | 28 Sep 2016. So I am giving of 5...star...?. Was this review helpful? Yes No. A premium superb phone for its cost.. By Yagnesh Sharma | 28 May 2016. I recently purchased my A8 - Gold in a local store as an exchange to my HTC 826. The most striking feature of A8 ofcourse is its design aesthetics. But most importantly the gadget, though stunning in looks, is extremely well built as for as its hardware is concerned. Packed in it, is its expansive 5.7 in Screen but really quite handy. Its Octa core 1.8 Ghz Exynos 5430 processor is at its blazing best. The principal rear camera is superb with very good capture at low lights. The front with wide selfie feature is comparable to I-phone 6. Why not flash for the front camera? -mobile makers should ponder on this. - The phone is as cool as a cucumber while performing - the one main reason why I discarded my earlier HTC. Even with long exposure to video capture it is only tolerably heated. The video capture (FHD)itself is excellent. The 2 GB RAM though could have been upgraded to 3 GB. Well for all other features like OTG support etc.. you name it, it has it. The sounds are little low though clear.But then is it asking for too much for its cost? (Street price Rs 26,000). Overall a critical assessment is that the phone is really very good and honest recommendation is - go for it..... Was this review helpful? Yes No. By Mini Iyer | 1 Feb 2018. Most of time the camera keeps focussing and refocussing resulting in blurry pictures especially in timer mode. I replaced the phone twice before requesting for a refund.. Was this review helpful?

While Samsung's flagship S7 receives praise from critics and the Note 7 is riddled with controversy , it's important not to forget about the Korean company's midrange phones. Last year, Samsung released the Galaxy A8. It was the company's slimmest phone at the time and came at a lower price than the Galaxy S6 .. This year, Samsung is rumored to make a follow-up to the A8, which could somewhat confusingly be called the A8 (2016). Thanks to frequent Twitter leaker @OnLeaks , we are getting a first look at renders that might belong to the phone (see gallery below).. Samsung Galaxy A8: This could be our first look. The pictures show a sleek phone with a glass front and metal body. The phone in the image bears a resemblance to the Galaxy S7, and does not have a curved display, unlike the Galaxy S7 Edge , Galaxy Note 7 and rumored curved-screen Galaxy S8 .. According to @OnLeaks, the dimensions of the new A8 come in at 156.5 mm x 77.5 mm x 7.3 mm. This makes it larger than the Galaxy S7, while still being slightly thinner. While the phone's specs are still unannounced, Android Authority speculates that it has a large, 5.7-inch display with a 1080-pixel resolution, a 16-megapixel rear camera and 3GB of RAM.. These rumored specs are similar to last years A8, but a bit more updated -- for example, the phone would jump from 2GB of RAM to 3GB. Not bad for a midrange phone, but of course, it would all come down to price. We'll have to see if this rumor pans out.. Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment..
