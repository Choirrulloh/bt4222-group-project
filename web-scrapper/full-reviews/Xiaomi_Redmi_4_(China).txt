(Just don't install this TWRP because it won't work on your device). DM-Verify is a security measure used by many OEMs to prevent custom ROM or kernel installing if by any chance the phone is stolen, this is basically making the phone less easier to crack open with private data on it. So for example, If you install an official ROM from Xiaomi, the phone won't boot because the recovery is different, you need to disable DM-verify..
