First Looks | Microsoft Kin ONEm (Verizon Wireless) |. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.. First Looks Microsoft Kin ONEm ... Zune Pass is Wi-Fi and sideload only. The Microsoft Kin ONEm is a good, low-priced feature phone sure to appeal to tweens and teens.. Compare the Microsoft Kin ONEm with several other cell phones side by side. The Microsoft Kin ONEm is Microsoft's update to the poorly conceived Kin One. Although the phone remains largely the same, its price has been cut significantly, along with some of its key features. Strangely, less is more here: an inadequate smartphone has become a charming feature phone .. The Kin ONEm is priced at $19.99 with a signed two-year contract, or $119.99 without. It is being sold as a feature phone with a range of 3G data plans, which include pay-as-you-go $1.99 per MB, $15.00 for 150 MB or $29.99 for unlimited data.. Physically, the phone is virtually identical to the Kin One; read our Kin One review for a rundown of the phone's physical features, voice performance, and battery life. Here we're going to focus on what's different, and whether or not the Kin ONEm is a better value than the Kin One was.. Kin One and Kin Two: A History. The original Microsoft Kin line was a pretty interesting failure. The Kin One and Kin Two looked like smartphones, sounded like smartphones and sort of worked like smartphones. But they weren't smartphones, even though they were priced like it. It was this strange middle groundfeature phone with benefits at a premium pricethat likely proved to be the nail in the Kin's coffin.. The original Kin line was shelved on June 30, a mere 48 days and less than 9,000 units after being introduced to the market. Just last week Verizon sent a letter to customers explaining that Kin Studio, the cloud service that allows Kin users free and unlimited storage of their photos, videos and contacts on Microsoft's servers, will be closing permanently on January 31, 2011.. All of this news adds up to sound like a death knell for the Kin, so it seemed like a curious decision when Verizon began to sell the rebranded Kin ONEm and Kin TWOm last month at a lower price tag and without the mandatory data plan.. According to a Verizon spokesperson, the new phones are meant to "provide an option for customers who liked the form factor of the previous Kin phones but want an Internet-capable device that doesn't require a data plan.". That is exactly what they do.. Social Networking: As mentioned, Facebook is no longer built in, although social networking sites may be accessed via web browser. We're sad to see this feature go, as the Kin line is still primarily being marketed as a social networking device for teens, but it is understandable given its new feature phone platform.. Kin Studio: Verizon is closing up shop on Kin Studio. This means that users of the Kin ONEm only have their phone's internal memory for data storage; it also means that if you want to download your photos from your phone, you have to use Microsoft's Windows-only Zune software. With only 4GB, the Kin ONEm doesn't pack much memory for users who want to store lots of music, record video or take a bunch of photos with the phone's 5-megapixel camera. The beauty of Kin Studio was that, with unlimited storage on Microsoft's servers, storage was a non issue. Current phones with removable storage can take up to 32 GB cards, so this omission is a major shortcoming.. This also means that the phone's address book doesn't sync up with anything. So be prepared to enter all of your contacts by hand to get started.. The Loop and The Spot: The Loop and The Spot have been completely done away with as well, as they directly designed to make use of the phone's built-in social networking capacity. While these features were fun and innovative, they are not completely necessary for a feature phone. They do not appear in the new software.. Zune Pass: No, it isn't gone, but Zune Pass is now available through Wi-Fi and sideload only. On one hand, it's nice to see that this feature is still available. On the other, just how useful will it prove to be when limited strictly to Wi-Fi connectivity? Being able to use Zune Pass through the 3G network was a big plus for the original Kin, so we will miss this feature.. The Kin ONEm is a charming little feature phone. In our review of the Kin One we said, "The Microsoft Kin One could have been a cute messaging phone, but it's being sold as an underpowered smartphone.". Now that it is being sold as a feature phone, this criticism has been addressed. It certainly isn't the best feature phone on the marketthe screen is still cramped and the non-expandable memory is only 4 gigsbut the new pricing plan instantly makes it more appealing than the Kin One ever was.. Not only that, but the Kin is a pretty solid phone overall. What it lacks in downloadable apps and instant messaging abilities it makes up for with a capable HTML web browser and good email support (including presets for Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo and AOL accounts). It supports threaded messaging, which is a great feature that will certainly appeal to frequent texters. And the phone still has a surprisingly spacious keyboard given its tiny size, as well as a general elegance in its build often lacking in other phones at this price point.. Comparisons between the Kin ONEm and Kin TWOm are inevitable. The Kin TWOm one-ups the Kin ONEm with a better camera, more storage space, and a larger screenbut it also lists for $100 more. Functionally, the phones are so similar, it ultimately comes down to a matter of taste. I suspect the tiny, quirky Kin ONEm will appeal to a younger audience. The Kin TWOm looks more like a smartphone, and will appeal to those looking for a more conventional messaging phone.. The Kin ONEm stands up tall in a class of messaging phones like the Samsung Intensity II ($29.99, 3 stars), LG Cosmos (Free, 3 stars), or LG Octane ($99.99, 3 stars). That makes recommending this phone easy. The Microsoft Kin ONEm is definitely a viable option for the tween (or adult with a sense of whimsy) who wants a cute, simple little phone to make calls and text friends..

Verizon announced Thursday that it is now offering the Kin ONEm and the Kin TWOm, but the devices are now features phones, not smartphones.. "They provide an option for customers who liked the form factor of the previous Kin phones but want an Internet-capable device that doesn't require a data plan," a Verizon spokeswoman said in an e-mail.. Verizon said it changed the name of the phones because the software for the Kin ONEm and Kin TWOm differ from the original Kin phones. The Kin Loop, Kin Spot, Kin Studio, social-networking integration, and automatic back-up have been removed. The original Kin phones ran their own OS, which was similar to Windows Phone 7, but did not allow for app downloads.. The Kin ONEm (above) is available for $19.99 with a two-year contract or $119.99 without, while the Kin TWOm is selling for $49.99 with contract and $219.99 without.. Microsoft introduced its Kin phones for Verizon in April. They were designed to appeal to social-networking focused teens and twenty-somethings, but given that most smartphones have social components these days and Apple released its wildly popular iPhone 4 just two months later, the Kin did not exactly fly off the shelves.. By June, Microsoft announced that the Kin was effectively dead. The company would fold the device into its Windows Phone 7 unit and focus all its efforts on the October launch of its new mobile OS. Microsoft said at the time that it would continue to work with Verizon to sell current Kin phones, but by July all online sales of the Kin One and Two were suspended, and Verizon reportedly returned unsold Kin phones to Microsoft .. Both phones support text and multi-media messaging and include the Zune media player, a Web browser, and e-mail support.. Who's Afraid of the Microsoft Kin? The Carriers.

The Kin TWOm features a 3.4-inch, 320-by-240 touch screen. It has a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, 8-megapixel camera with flash, and supports HD video. It has 8GB of storage and is Wi-Fi capable.. The Kin ONEm features a 2.6-inch, 320-by-240 touch screen. It also has a slide-out QWERTY keyboard and a 5-megapixel camera with flash, but does not support video capture.
