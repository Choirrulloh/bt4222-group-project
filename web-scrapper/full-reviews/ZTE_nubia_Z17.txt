Download our Official Android App: Forums for Android!. ZTE Nubia Z17 - set-up issue?. Discussion in ' Android Apps & Games ' started by Timbo111 , Jan 14, 2018 .. Hi all - I was using a Xiaomi mi A1 in the UK with Oreo - brilliant phone for the price. Unfortunately I dropped it from a great height and killed it stone dead.I don't really know why but I replaced it with a ZTE Nubia z17 Lite which I've had now for a couple of weeks. The phone works ok but started crashing and freezing such that I felt it necessary to do a factory data reset. However the phone now won't move through the set-up process and refuses to boot up or copy data in the Google cloud. So basically the phone doesn't work anymore. The phone was a global edition fully compatible with Google Play etc. Am not getting any responses from ZTE or the Chinese retailer where I purchased the phone. Grateful for any advice on how I can get this phone up and running again. I've attached a picture of the three or four screens that the phone currently recycles around ..,. Thanks in advance for your thoughts. a" style="margin: 0px; padding: 10px 10px 0px; overflow: hidden; zoom: 1; background-image: none; background-position: center top; background-size: initial; background-repeat: repeat-x; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 13px;">. File size: 105.3 KB. I just received a Nubia Z17 Lite which I purchased for my wife today. Went to set it up and have same issue you describe. Also came across report on YouTube showing same but it is in German.. Hi all - I was using a Xiaomi mi A1 in the UK with Oreo - brilliant phone for the price.

I set itbp out of the box. Setup was fine the first time. After using Oreo on native Android, the Nubia launcher is poor so I was using the Microsoft Launcher (surprisingly excellent) with adaptive icons from Action Launcher. Think I've given it schizophrenia......have mailed ZTE but they have sent three identical responses asking for loads of information expressing deep sorrow at my predicament and then referred me back to the retailer. I've received a video from Nubia and it has got through the initial setup. I'm in work so haven't set it up completely but roughly fix is. No sim, don't have it in range of known wi-fi. Select setup without a network, do not enter a name and select pin and or fingerprint unlock and it's done. I won't know fully until I get home and setup Google account egg if this fully resolves the problems!. Do you already have an account?.

The ZTE Nubia Z17 could come with a massive 8GB of RAM. It has been a while since ZTE has launched a major high-end smartphone, but that could change at some point in the near future. While ZTE launched the Nubia Z17 Mini last month , the company could be looking to release a standard version of the Z17 at some point in the near future.. The news comes in the form of a screenshot allegedly from the company’s internal website, which shows that the ZTE Nubia Z17 will start with a whopping 6GB of RAM, with options ranging up to 8GB of RAM. If accurate, the Nubia Z17 would be. among the first in the world with 8GB of RAM, and that should help make the phone among the more powerful out there, if coupled with a high-end chip. The screenshot, which was posted on Weibo , also notes that the device will start with 128GB of storage, which is also a high starting point.. Previous reports indicated that the phone would come with 4GB of RAM, so it is somewhat surprising to see variants with as much as 8GB.. The screenshot also reveals some aspects of. By the looks of things, the device will look a little different than the Z17 Mini, and will boast a dual rear-facing camera and fingerprint sensor on the back. It will also be available in three colors —. an edge-to-edge display with almost no bezels on each side of the device.. Unfortunately, at this point it’s difficult to verify the accuracy of the report, and it is a little strange that ZTE would launch the “mini” version of the device before the “standard” version. Perhaps more unfortunate is the fact that the Nubia Z17 will likely only see a China release, like the Mini.. ZTE launches Oreo Beta Program to finally bring Android O to the Axon 7.

ZTE Nubia Z17 review Source: GSM Arena There are a few different ways to look at the Nubia Z17, but it definitely is a worthy addition to the 2017 flagship club. With a price tag south of the $500 mark, just the right bit cheaper than the OnePlus 5, the Nubia Z17 is probably the most affordable package with a Snapdragon 835 under the hood. This could've been calculated or coincidental, but ZTE didn't stop there and the phone deserves some credit for trying to over-deliver in terms of audio and imaging too.

On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. ZTE is short for Zhong Xing Telecommunication Equipment Company Limited, which was founded in China in 1985. The product range includes, for example, USB sticks, routers, smartphones and tablets..

Bu videomuz da ZTE'nin yeni amiral gemisi ZTE Nubia Z17'yi inceledik. Çünkü ayak üstü tripodsuz çok kötü bir kamerayla ancak çekebildik. Yurt dışından getirtmek isteyipte kafasında soru işareti olanlar ve Türçe kullanıcı ve incelemesini yapanı bulamayanlar için belki fikir verir. Önemli olan videoda temel detaylarını vermektir. Buradan eklemek istediğim antutu videosu çekemedim ama 180bin civarı puan almaktadır. Video kötü olduğu için kusuruma bakmayın. Bu videonun altından ''Sınırsızca Soru Sorabilirsiniz'' bıkmadan cevap vereceğimden emin olabilirsiniz. When autoplay is enabled, a suggested video will automatically play next..
