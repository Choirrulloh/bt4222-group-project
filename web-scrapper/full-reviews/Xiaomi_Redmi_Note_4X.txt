Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X smartphone review. Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 4X is a steal at $160, but it lacks 4G LTE. With a brilliant design, big battery, and bargain price, the Redmi Note 4X is crying out for international support.. With a brilliant design, big battery, and bargain price, the Redmi Note 4X is crying out for international support.. With a brilliant design, big battery, and bargain price, the Redmi Note 4X is crying out for international support.. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Xiaomi may capture headlines for stunning, high-power smartphones like the Mi Mix. and the Mi 6 , which are great devices; but arguably the company does low-cost hardware with strong spec lists better. Its latest is the Redmi Note 4X, an update to 2016’s Redmi Note 4 , which costs about $160 depending on the color you choose. That’s not very much money for a smartphone today, especially one with features like the Note 4X.. Like all Xiaomi phones, if you want to own one outside China, you have to use an import service to get it. It’s not difficult, but it can be a challenge down the line if the phone breaks, and making sure it connects to your chosen network. It’s extremely tempting to pick up a $160 phone that looks like it should cost twice that, so should you?. We’ve been using the Redmi Note 4X for the last two weeks to find out, and the answer is no. It’s a fantastic phone for the price, but the dealbreaker is its lack of 4G LTE connectivity.. If you’re familiar with the Redmi Note 4, little has changed with the Redmi Note 4X. Two small screws on both sides of the MicroUSB charging port have been removed for a cleaner look, and the antenna bands have been minimized and replaced by shiny strips, rather than cheap-looking white plastic. Nothing major, but enough to make the Note 4X a modern, sleek looking phone you’ll be proud to hold.. It’s quite thick at 8.5mm, but it’s comfortable to hold due to a 2.5D piece of curved glass over the screen, and a perfectly curved aluminum rear panel. Cradling the Redmi Note 4X, you’ll find it ergonomical. The power button falls easily to thumb or finger (depending if you’re left or right handed), and the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is ideally placed, so your finger avoids the camera lens above it. It’s a grippable phone, and one that doesn’t feel too slippery.. If you like phones without much branding, the Redmi Note 4X will please you. Only a Mi logo is etched into the back, and the usual three Android capacitive keys sit below the screen, glowing when the phone is awake. The Note 4X is available in several different colors, including silver, gold, black, and pink, plus the light green version seen here. The light green has a slight matte effect, but retains a decent light-catching glow, as well as a subtle, tactile texture. Phones in multiple colors are becoming more popular, and to find such unique hues on a phone so competitively priced is very welcome.. Minimalist, stylish, and pleasant to hold, it’s surprising the Redmi Note 4X costs so little.. The Redmi Note 4X has a Pixel XL -size screen, and it’s big, bright, and beautiful. It’s not an AMOLED panel though, but an IPS LCD screen that measures 5.5-inches and has a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution. It can’t compete with the Pixel XL , the Galaxy S8 , or the LG G6; but holds its own against the OnePlus 3T , various Honor phones, and even some more expensive Huawei devices like the P10 Plus .. Minimalist, stylish, and pleasant to hold, it’s surprising the Redmi Note 4X costs so little.. There are plenty of customization options. A Reading Mode reduces glare and cuts down on sleep-disturbing blue light , plus adjustments can be made to the color and contrast, helping tailor the screen’s look to your personal preference. It’s also very bright with a maximum output of 450 nits, and it’s easily viewable in bright sunlight with the brightness slider cranked right up. The ambient light sensor is quite aggressive though, and it doesn’t recognize when you’re looking at the screen, resulting in the brightness dimming at inopportune moments.. A massive 4,100mAh battery keeps the screen on — that’s enormous compared to most flagship smartphones. The result? At least two days use. Yep, we said, “at least.” Leave the phone on standby, and use it normally through the day, and you’ll be charging on the third day. The Redmi Note 4X sips from a vast well of battery power. Unfortunately, that well isn’t quickly replenished, due to no fast-charging system, so plan for a two hour recharge when it’s close to empty.. Here’s the big difference between the older Chinese Redmi Note 4 and the new globally compatible Note 4X: It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor inside, rather than a MediaTek chip. The Redmi Note 4X is almost identical to the international version of the Note 4 released after the Chinese version though. Confused? Don’t be, just remember the Redmi Note 4X is the model to buy, and you’ll be fine. There’s a version with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and another with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage space. Our review model is the former.. Judging whether a smartphone has enough performance isn’t that complicated. We use the phone daily, for a similar range of tasks, and if it’s slow, buggy, or annoying, it gets a big strikethrough next to its name. We’d never expect to see this with a device that costs $500 or more, but one that costs less than $200? That seems more likely. The fantastic news here is the Redmi Note 4X is strikethrough free.. After a solid hour playing games, reading email, checking social networks, and generally zipping between the home screens and different apps, the Redmi Note 4X hadn’t stuttered. Its very hard to argue against a phone that costs so little, yet performs so well. Running AnTuTu 3D benchmarking test returned a 62,771 score, while 3DMark’s Slingshot Extreme returned a score of 461, neither of which set the record charts alight, but are consistent with the Snapdragon 625-powered Huawei Nova .. The phone runs Android 6.0.1, with Xiaomi’s MIUI 8.2 user interface over the top. It’s one of the best third-party user interfaces out there, with the biggest change over stock Android being the lack of an app drawer. All your apps are spread over multiple home pages, just like Apple’s iOS. Android purists will be annoyed by other small changes, such as the altered notification shade, custom icon designs, and other visual tweaks throughout the operating system. Google Play came pre-installed on our phone, but be aware that due to the custom nature of MIUI, some apps — such as the updated Netflix app. It’s a rarity this happens though, and every other app we used operated without a problem.. Is it all good news? No. The Redmi Note 4X is still a mid-range phone, with a mid-range processor, and a custom UI. This means scrolling isn’t always buttery smooth, some of the transitions are a beat too slow, and in some games when the going gets really tough — driving the fastest cars in Reckless Racing 3 , for example — there’s evidence of frame rate drops. Android Pay also won’t work, as there’s no NFC onboard.. Still, for the price, the Redmi Note 4X is a solid performer. It’s a shame it does not come with the latest version of Android.. A 13-megapixel rear camera sits at the top-center, and it’s good. It’s not often we get to praise what has become a very typical camera setup, but the pictures we took with the Redmi Note 4X were pleasing, offering detail, and handling challenging light in a satisfactory way.. It’s still far from perfect, and the f/2.0 aperture does limit its capabilities in low light, but show it some sunny skies or an expansive landscape, and the results are eyebrow-raisingly good. Yes, it washes out the sky on overcast days, and no, it doesn’t have two lenses or a wealth of different modes. However, take regular photos in everyday situations and you’ll likely be happy with the results.. The camera is quick, and we love being able to use the fingerprint sensor to take a photo in the app — it’s really convenient.. It suffers because it doesn’t support the most commonly used 4G LTE bands for the U.S.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X isn’t sold in the U.S., the U.K., or officially any places outside China and Xiaomi’s usual markets. That means you have to import it if you want one. Ours came from GearBest , an importer of Chinese electronics we’ve used several times, and the experience has always been good.. What does this mean if it goes wrong? It comes with a three-day dead-on-arrival warranty, a 45-day money back guarantee, plus a one-year warranty to cover against defects. For after sales service, you’ll still have to communicate primarily by email and the post. If you break the phone due to mistreatment, drop it in the bath, or change the software and brick the phone, it won’t be covered; but that’s to be expected.. How much is it? The price varies due to currency fluctuations, but you won’t pay much more than $200. At the time of writing, the light green model we tested is available for just $167 through GearBest with free delivery. There are other importers out there, and prices for the Redmi Note 4X will vary between them.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X Compared To. A real smartphone bargain, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X has battery life to spare, but misses out on crucial connectivity options.. The Redmi Note 4X, like the vast majority of Xiaomi phones, suffers because it doesn’t support the most commonly used 4G LTE bands for the U.S. and the U.K., which restricts its connectivity to 3G. You must be prepared to accept this, if you buy one. The frustrating thing is, if the Note 4X supported all international bands, it would be unstoppable in terms of value.. We consider 4G LTE connections to be essential, where available, and therefore suggest you look at the $250 Honor 6X , the $200 ZTE Axon 7 Mini , or the $230 Moto G5 Plus. All three are more expensive than the Note 4X, but they operate properly in the United States.. Xiaomi does update its software, but the phone doesn’t run Android 7.0 Nougat, or have the latest security update from Google. This is a common compliant with many phones, not just those made by Xiaomi. It may get updated to Android 7.0 Nougat, but don’t expect major updates down the line.. The phone itself is not especially durable, and isn’t water resistant; but the body is made from plastic and metal, so should resist average wear and tear from regular use. Due to its relative low power, depending on your needs, it will likely need replacing after two years of use.. Not if you value 4G LTE connectivity. It’s really the only reason not to pick up the Redmi Note 4X, which is otherwise astonishingly good value for money. It did everything we asked, has battery power to spare, a good screen, and a solid if unremarkable camera. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

A fine budget phone for UK users, we review Xiaomi's Redmi Note 4X. SHOULD I BUY XIAOMI REDMI NOTE 4X?. It looks a lot like the Redmi Note 4, and that’s because it is - so why should you upgrade to the Note 4X? We explain the key differences in our review of Xiaomi’s latest budget phablet. This budget phablet from Xiaomi looks very familiar. 5.5in full-HD (1920x1080, 401ppi) 2.5D IPS LCD screen. MIUI 8.1 based on Android 6. 2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 octa-core processor. Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X design and build. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X core hardware and performance. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X connectivity and extras. In August 2016 Xiaomi announced the Redmi Note 4 as the phablet in its budget line-up. We reviewed the Chinese version of that smartphone, which featured a 5.5in full-HD screen and reasonable performance from the Helio X20 deca-core processor. An international model launched later with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 onboard.. Also see: Best Chinese phones 2017. Today we have in front of us the Redmi Note 4X, a nearly identical phone that was unveiled in February 2017 with the same 5.5in full-HD screen and Snapdragon 625 chip. To be fair it’s the global model, which means it works better for a UK audience (we’ll explain that in more detail below), and it has a few more colour options and swaps out the minimal plastic parts on the previous design for metal, but it’s otherwise the same phone.. Scan the spec sheet and you’ll notice a few other tweaks that you probably wouldn’t have realised had we not pointed them out: Bluetooth has been updated from 4.1 to 4.2, but 802.11ac Wi-Fi connectivity has been removed; the Samsung S5K3L8 sensor has been switched for a same-spec Sony IMX258; the IR port has moved over to the side on the top edge; and the screws that previously sat either side of the Micro-USB port are now gone. You also get MIUI 8.1, though of course you can easily update the OS on the earlier Redmi Note 4.. One of the more obvious changes is that to the available RAM and storage options. Whereas previously you could buy the Note 4 with 2- or 3GB of RAM and 16- or 64GB of storage, the Note 4X comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.. You'll also like: Best big-screen phones 2017. We’ve reviewed the Global edition of the 3GB RAM, 32GB storage Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X, which at the time of writing is available via GearBest for £164.76 ($202/184.40€).. Those new colour options we mentioned are available only to the International and Chinese versions of the Note 4X, and you can get a pink, light green, champagne gold or black model from GearBest for £207.66 ($254.59/232.40€).. The grey international model is available from GearBest's Hong Kong warehouse. for the cheaper price of £130.50 ($159.99/146.05 €).. It also lists the 4GB RAM, 64GB storage International edition, which is available in only champagne gold at £182.17 ($223.34/203.88€).. Both the international and global editions are suitable for a UK audience, but we thoroughly recommend UK customers opt for the global edition given its support for all three 4G bands used by our major mobile networks. The international models do not support 800MHz/Band 20, which means customers of O2, GiffGaff and Sky Mobile won’t be able to receive 4G connectivity at all, and customers of other networks may find their 4G coverage more patchy in certain areas.. If you are buying from GearBest, read up on the pros and cons of buying tech from China first. And be prepared that you may have to pay import duty on the phone when it arrives in the UK (20 percent of the value on the shipping paperwork, plus an admin fee of around £11).. The Redmi Note 4 saw some significant design changes over the Redmi Note 3, replacing its plastic top and bottom parts with a full metal unibody build. The Note 4X we see here doesn’t make any drastic changes, merely replacing the white plastic antenna lines with a shiny metallic band, but we’re just as keen on the design as we were the first time around. Also see: Best Android phones 2017. For a budget phone the Redmi Note 4X is very well made. It has fairly slim bezels to the left and right of the screen, which combined with the gently sloping edges at the rear prevent it from feeling cumbersome in a single hand. It feels tough and built to last, and it looks good too.. The two phones are practically identical in size and weight, with the Note 4X a slight 8.5mm thick and tipping the scales at 171g.. The twin speaker grilles stay put in their new home at the foot of the phone, and there’s still just a mono speaker found inside. The metal screws we could previously see either side are gone, but this will bother you only if you plan on opening up the Xiaomi and taking a look inside.. As before three Android-standard multitasking, home and back buttons sit below the screen, with the phone’s fingerprint scanner found at the rear below the camera. And you still get a headphone jack and IR blaster at the top, and volume rocker and power key on the side. Also see: Best mid-range phones 2017. The screen hasn’t changed either, and is still a 5.5in IPS panel with accurate colours and crystal clear resolution. This is, again, a full-HD (1920x1080 pixels) screen with a pixel density of 401ppi. And, as with the Note 4, it’s covered with a layer of 2.5D curved glass that makes a huge subconscious difference to your perception of the phone: running your finger over a smooth surface rather than a raised lip just feels so much more natural.. Those who purchased the International version of the Redmi Note 4 will unlikely see any performance gains in the Note 4X since it features the same 2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 octa-core processor, although there is a new 4GB RAM option to be had here. Also see: What's the fastest phone?. Unfortunately, we didn’t test the Qualcomm-based Redmi Note 4, and our Note 4X is the 3GB RAM version.. When compared to the Helio X20 Redmi Note 4 we reviewed, performance from the Snapdragon 625-toting Note 4X is actually lower. We can’t compare our Geekbench processing speed scores, since the Note 4 was tested in Geekbench 3 and the Note 4X in Geekbench 4, but in both the AnTuTu core performance and GFXBench graphics tests the Note 4X turned in significantly lower scores. It did better only in the JetStream JavaScipt benchmark, and only slightly.. The Redmi Note 4 came with either 16- or 64GB of storage, and both supported up to 128GB of additional storage via microSD. You can still make use of expandable storage here, but Xiaomi has also bumped up the lower storage amount to 32GB. That’s great news, with 32GB quickly becoming the standard in this category. Also see: How to add storage to Android. Battery performance also falls into this category, and with both phones fitted with a 4,100mAh battery and the potential to run the latest MIUI 8.1 OS, don’t expect any huge increases in the newer model. That said, this is a very generous amount of juice, particularly for a budget phone, and should get you through a couple of days. (And you can always use a power bank if you need more.). Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X review continues on the next page >>. We were hoping with the increasing popularity of mobile payment services that the Redmi Note 4X would add NFC to its spec sheet, but alas it does not. Xiaomi has upgraded the Bluetooth from 4.1 to 4.2, but it has also snatched away the 802.11ac wireless networking connectivity.. Something you can’t take for granted these days is the IR blaster built into both smartphones - this is becoming rarer and rarer. You also get GPS and GLONASS, and OTG.. One of the great things about buying a Chinese phone is its dual-SIM operation. This Redmi Note 4X, in common with its predecessor, will accept two SIMs in a dual-standby fashion, or one SIM and a Micro-SD card. If you want to manage two phone numbers without carrying two phones, it’s a very useful feature to have.. Be warned that several versions of the Redmi Note 4X exist, and only the Global edition (sold here) supports all three UK 4G LTE bands. Also see: How to tell whether a phone is supported by your network .. On paper the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X appears to have the same camera setup as the Note 4, but we believe the 13Mp Samsung primary sensor has been swapped out for a Sony IMX258. That’s great news, because we really weren’t overly impressed by the soft detail offered by the Note 4’s camera. Also see: Best phone cameras 2017. By comparison the Note 4X takes a decent photo at this price point, with bright, natural colours and good levels of detail - we were able to make out the characters on street signs from our seventh floor roof terrace. HDR mode really makes a big difference, though, so don’t forget to experiment with that also to get the best photos from the Note 4X.. You can see a couple of our Xiaomi test shots below, with Auto settings and HDR mode engaged respectively.. You’ll find the standard Xiaomi Camera app installed on the Note 4X, complete with various useful shooting modes including Manual and Beautify and real-time filters. It’s clean and easy to use.. The 5Mp selfie camera also features these real-time filters, but far fewer shooting modes: you’ll find just Timer, Audio and a Beauty filter.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X runs MIUI 8.1 , which is a customised version of Android Marshmallow. It’s a fair deviation from the OS, with the app tray removed and the settings menu rearranged, but a search option here quickly helps find the items you need. Also see: Best phones 2017. Drawbacks of Xiaomi phones for UK users is usually that they come without Google services preinstalled, that they don’t support the 800MHz band (Band 20) required by some mobile operators for 4G LTE access, and that you often have to find your way through various Chinese-language apps and notifications.. The Global edition we’ve reviewed here, however, is different. The Play store and a few Google apps are preinstalled, and you can configure it for UK use out of the box..

Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X Specs List. Display: 5.5 inches at 1920 x 1080 pixels. Dimensions: 151mm x 76mm x 8.45mm. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X Design: Colorful Housing. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X Camera Experience. The first smartphone of Xiaomi in 2017 is the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X. This device doesn’t boast of any crazy features, but it makes millions of buyers to fall in love with itself at the first sight. The reason is hidden under the great combination of appearance, hardware, software, and pricing. We repeat this statement for many Xiaomi devices, but it’s not a fluent phrase. This manufacturer was able to grow quickly thanks to the policy it follows blindly. It assumes making good devices with at least one innovative feature and sells it for a song. I guess the best example of this is the Xiaomi Mi 5. But the Mi family devices are designed for another category of buyers, while the Redmi devices are thought to be more budget-friendly. So every time we hear this company comes in with another Redmi device, we can suppose it will be priced affordably. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X is the best example of it. Though there are little differences in comparison to the original Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, this handset comes with a few improvements in terms of look and configuration.. Check Out The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X Deal. The packaging of this phone is identical to its predecessors. It comes in a white box carrying no photos and printing on it.. The back of the box comes with some details about the phone including a display size, processor model, battery capacity, memory combination, cameras and so on.. As for the appearance, we have already managed to come in with in-depth reviews concerning only the look of the Redmi Note 4X. But to make this review complete we have to take a look at its design one more time.. Read : Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X Design Review 1. Read : Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X Design Review 2. The predecessor of this device looked identical to high-end models. As the Redmi Note 4X comes with the same appearance, it looks like a top-notch smartphone as well. This is the first selling point of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X. The front panel carries a front camera and a proximity sensor on the upper side. The speaker is located between them. So the front panel provides a symmetric design.. The bottom side comes with three touch buttons. But they are not placed on display, so no one can complain saying as they reduce the screen size.. The display comes at 5.5 inches, thus we are dealing with a phablet.. The back of the Redmi Note 4X provides a traditional three-stage design. Though we say the phone comes with a metal housing, this statement is not absolutely true. I mean the upper and lower parts are made of plastic, while the middle part is made of metal. To make some clearance this design has come since the third-gen smartphone.. Other than that, the back panel carries a 13MP camera paired with dual-LED flash and fingerprint scanner.. The top side carries a microphone hole, IR remote control, and a 3.5mm audio jack.. As for the bottom, it comes with a symmetrical design as well carrying two speakers and a microUSB port between them.. The SIM tray is located on the left side.. The volume rocker and a power button are on the right.. The phone actually is at 8.45mm thickness, but thanks to a curved back panel it looks the way thinner.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X comes with a MIUI8.2 based on Android 6.0. This system is about 6 years old. Now after several major upgrades, this UI has become one of the most mature systems in China. Well, let’s take a quick look at the most attractive features of MIUI8.2 and Redmi Note 4X software.. Thanks to this feature the phone can remotely control another phone. If you wonder what cases it can be useful for, remember how our parents try to use smartphones. As you can see in the gif below, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X controls another Mi phone, the Mi 5.. MIUI8 comes with an iOS-like negative screen function called as ‘desktop intelligence assistant’. Users can add any apps into it and get real-time info on them.. As we know, MIUI8 supports Alipay fingerprint payment. It requires only a single tap to complete the payment process. However, we are waiting for WeChat payment system to come with such an opportunity.. One of the best features coming with the MIUI8 is ‘the dual apps and dual logins’. Any app can be doubled and each of them will work independently.. The Windows Phone OS is known for its live tiles and a minimalist design. MIUI8 has something like that, so you can use it anytime.. The main camera of the phone comes at 13MP 5-axis lens, f/2.0 aperture and paired with a dual-tone LED flash. The sensor model number is IMX258. It can be found on smartphones like the Xiaomi Redmi Pro and Meizu M3E.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X camera features. The phone is capable of recording 1080P videos.. The camera apps is regular for Redmi handsets. It comes with a standard list of modes.. Thanks to PDAF the focus speed is quite acceptable. In the daytime sample, the color saturation is high.. As for low-light conditions, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X reduces the brightness. So you can see only the main details.. However, there are some shortcomings such as OIS, but the overall shooting performance is good. So we can say, this phone can be used for taking non-professional photos.. This smartphone features a Snapdragon 625 processor, which is considered as the first octa-core chip based on 14nm process technology. The key features of this CPU is the excellent power control. But when describing it we use regular features such as 8 cores clocked at 2.0GHz, A53 architecture, Adreno 506 graphics, and Cat7 LTE network support. However, to understand whether this processor is capable of doing heavy tasks, we have to put it into a few tests.. The overall performance is stable varying between 70% and 100%. Depending on the situation any of eight cores can implement separate tasks. The CPU frequency has reached up to 1.6GHz during the test. In comparison to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, there is a big gap in terms of AnTuTu scores. But I guess this difference is related to the technological differences between the Snapdragon 625 and MediaTek Helio X20.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X scores 822 points at single-core and 2972 at multi-core tests.. The phone was tested for game playing and it showed acceptable results. On the other hand, It’s not recommended to play too heavy games.. It showed the best result in this test in comparison to the Meizu X and Meizu M5 Note .. To understand the overall performance level we put it next to the Xiaomi Mi MAX , Redmi Note 3 , and Vivo X9. It showed almost the same results as the aforementioned models.. At last the Redmi Note 4X was tested via King of Glory. The whole process was very smooth. So we can assume you can play small 3D games, but it will face some problems when playing heavy games.. This device is equipped with a 4100mAh battery, which is common for Redmi phones.. As you know, the charge test starts at 5% power and write down results every 10 minutes. During the test no apps are open and the WiFI is turned off. At the beginning of the process, it charges very fast. It takes only 40 minutes to get charged over 50%. But once the phone reaches 66% the charging speed slows down. Finally, when the phone reaches 90% of power, the charging speeds becomes too slow. It took almost 1 hour and 36 minutes to charge the phone completely.. To check out the discharging we played a TV series at 100% screen brightness, super clear play quality, sound out of 50%, and WiFi was turned on. When we were testing the discharging the Redmi Note 4X has 77% of power. And after 4 sets (45 minutes per set) the phone still has 57% of power.. Starting the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 smartphones from this series get batteries larger than 4000mAh. This is one of the selling points. As for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X, it continues this tradition but it is packed with better features. We can say the battery is the only selling point of this device, but it will be a sin. The Redmi Note 4X is the cheapest Snapdragon 625 model available in the market. But if you want more, there will be a higher version as well.. As for appearance, the phone looks like a top-notch smartphone, but it is designed for another niche. Plus, it comes in five color options, though the most attractive of them is considered to be the aquamarine variant. The latter is priced a bit higher, but you can choose any from other four color options for 999 yuan ($145). The only problem is related to capacity. The phone has been launched and sold out immediately. We guess several bunches will have the same fortune as well.. Buy Xiaomi Phone Redmi Note 4X at $157.99 on GearBest XiaomiToday Best Deals.

I ask this as a genuine question, when great phones like the Redmi Note 4 ( review here ) and the Redmi 4 Prime ( review here ) already exist.. Let’s switch gears for a moment. Why did Xiaomi choose to use the Snapdragon 625 in a Note device when the Note 3 used a 650 series chip? This decision seems like it would cannibalize sales of the aforementioned Redmi 4 Prime.. Nevertheless, the Redmi Note 4X is another great phone by Xiaomi that doesn’t need to exist.. 5.5” devices are still the most popular screen size by far with individuals like me (who prefer smaller phones) being the exception. The Redmi Note 4X is almost identical to the Redmi 4, but that might not be a bad thing as the Redmi 4 Prime was a great device in its own right.. I was seriously contemplating replacing my Zuk Z2 with the Redmi 4 Prime, but I was not willing to give up the speed of a Snapdragon 820 for the battery life of the Prime. However I am considering making the switch again.. Big thanks to Gearbest for providing this review unit.. Other companies are scrambling to catch up to Xiaomi’s Mi Mix, so this was (one of) Xiaomi’s opportunities to at least shrink the bezels on its Redmi Note series of phones. However, the physical dimensions of this phone are the exact same size as the older Redmi Note 4. It retains the same size, a similar shape, and the same amount of bezels as its older big brother. It’s a bit unwieldy for someone with small hands (like me), but the curved back and chamfered edges to help with that.. The black bar around the screen is very apparent on the white version of this phone and I had wished this was eliminated as it is unsightly enough to be a dealbreaker for some. We have backlit capacitive buttons below the screen and the fingerprint sensor on the back. The hardware buttons are slightly mushy and lack the crisp feedback on other more expensive devices.. Xiaomi most likely used the exact same physical design as the older Redmi Note 4 to reduce costs, but the phone could have been smaller. The last point of contention I have with the build is the use of the older MicroUSB port instead of the newer USB-C port, but I suspect that not everyone will have an issue with that.. The Note 4X sports a 5.5” full HD IPS display and it is quite a pleasure to use. Colours are quite vivid and deep and the display is sharp. However, devices in the $200 range all feature similarly great screens so the excellent display used in here stands out a lot less. reading news on the screen is razor sharp and is generally a pleasure to use.. Maximum brightness is good at around 450 nits, easily viewable in direct sunlight. However, the display is reflective so it might be tough to see it in strong sunlight. Speaker quality here is pretty much the exact same as the older Redmi Note 4, meaning decently loud sound with some slight distortion in certain tracks at max volume. However lower the volume a tad and its gone. Mids and highs are decently clear but bass is lacking in this phone.. If you go back to my Redmi 4 Prime review, you will remember that the Prime blew me, a battery fanatic, away completely. The Redmi Note 4X for all intents and purposes should get the same, if slightly less battery life than the Redmi 4 Prime due to the bigger screen. I was only able to perform one round of battery tests due to the incredible length of each test, and battery life is absolutely amazing.. I got 11 hours of screen on time with 18% left at the end of the day. This was incredibly heavy use, with about 6 hours of intense gaming, an hour of snapping photos, 2 hours of Youtube, and the rest was web browsing, SMS, news. This actually edges out my Redmi 4 Prime battery tests which you can check out here. Becaue the battery life on the Redmi 4 Prime and Note 4X are so similar, I thought some further anecdotal evidence might be useful here.. My sister who uses my Redmi 4 Prime regularly ends the day with about 80% battery life. This is mostly Snapchat, Snapchat, Snapchat, and a bit of Instagram. She has gone 4-5 days without charging before, but most of the time she still plugs it in at the end of the day by habit.. Quick charge via the microUSB cable stands at about 2 hours to a full charge.. Heavy users like me can get through two days of heavy use with no issue while light and medium users will be able to get at least 4 days of light use.. By this point I’ve gotten used to custom versions of Android, with phones using EMUI, MIUI, and ZUI popping up just as frequently as stock Android. That being said, MIUI is one of the best, complete, and most optimized versions available out there in the market and it works well. System animations are fluid and polished, swiping between screens is silky smooth and its generally a pleasure to use.. However, the Snapdragon 625 is the first point of contention I have with this phone. Because this is a Note device, its only fair we compare performance to other Note devices. The Snapdragon 625 does lag slightly behind the Helio X20 (and up) and the Snapdragon 650 series in opening and closing apps.. There is a slight moment of hesitation in this 625 that is either drastically reduced or non existent in more powerful chips. That being said, its still plenty useable and perfect for normal use even for someone like me. Do note that MIUI tends to clear out your RAM quite frequently forcing you to relaunch apps, but you can turn that off in developer options.. The Snapdragon 625 is powerful enough to run even the most intense games without hiccups. This is quite impressive especially at the 1080p resolution. There will be a game here and there that might require lowered graphical settings to run at a high framerate, but those are few and far between.. I ran just one benchmark, Antutu, and it obtained a score of around 60,000, exactly what I expected from a Snapdragon 625 chip.. Performance here is very good and the snapdragon 625 is a very good chip as well. however, my complaint stems from the fact that Redmi Note devices have traditionally been more powerful than Redmi devices, but here we have the exact same chipset in both Redmi and Note devices. This seems to be an anomaly that some will not want repeated.. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate, I didn’t see any issues here. It is slightly slower than top end sensors on S7s and iPhones, but its still more than fast enough for the average user. It does have trouble trying to detect my fingers if the skin is wet though.. Connectivity here is strong, but not as strong as my Zuk Z2. I still saw more frequent drops to HSPA+ compared to the latter device, but speeds were still good. My speedtest results yielded very decent speeds as well. Bluetooth, WiFi, and GPS reception was all very good and I did not see any issues with those.. The Redmi Note 4 has a 13MP camera with f/2.0 lens and PDAF. The camera does a great job taking photos in well lit conditions with detailed photos and saturated colours. Colours and detail improve when HDR is turned on, but it does take longer to take a photo. Other smartphones have improved the HDR snap time quite a bit, leaving the Redmi Note 4’s HDR snap time a little slower.. The camera does have trouble with low light shots, but much less so The front facing camera takes passable shots in good lighting conditions, indoors its a hit or miss, and the camera struggles with low light.. The phone is capable of up to 1080p video and quality is good enough. You can actually shoot in 4K if you use a third party camera app like Open Camera, and the quality is good.. The camera app is quite feature rich, allowing you to tweak various camera related settings to get better shots.. I said it once and I’ll say it again; the Redmi Note 4X is a great phone that doesn’t need to exist. You can either take a step down in size to the Redmi 4 Prime or a step up in processing power to the original Redmi Note 4. Still though, those who feel compelled to purchase this phone won’t be disappointed.. While this phone’s processor is fairly weak for a Note device, it more than makes up for that in battery life, matching the Redmi 4 Prime’s battery life tit for tat. The Snapdragon 625 utilized in this device is no slouch either, pushing anything it throws your way.. If you do purchase this device, I recommend getting at least the 3GB version of the Redmi Note 4X as MIUI does use more resources than stock Android does. I also highly recommend reading both Gizchina’s reviews for the Redmi Note 4 ( review here ) and the Redmi 4 Prime ( review here ) before making your decision as you might find one of the other two devices more appealing.. You can buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X here .. Good device, but look at the Note 4 and the Prime.

This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. Xiaomi Tech was founded as a Chinese smartphone producer in 2010 and soon reached high market shares in its home market. Although Xiaomi is not one of the Top 5 smartphone manufacturers worldwide in 2016, it is nevertheless one of the big global players in this market segment.. Since 2015 there are many reviews. The ratings have been above average since 2016.. Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus Adreno 506. Similar devices from a different Manufacturer. Asus Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro ZD552KL Adreno 506.

Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x Review: VIDEO Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x Review: UNBOXING Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Review: DESIGN and DISPLAY Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x Review: HARDWARE and PERFORMANCE Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x Review: BENCHMARKS Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x Review: USER INTERFACE Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x Review: CAMERA Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x Review: IMAGE QUALITY Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x Review: CONNECTIVITY Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x Review: BATTERY LIFE Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x Review: CONCLUSIONS. Xiaomi’s Redmi Note lineup has been very popular both in China and internationally. The Redmi Note 4x is the upgrade to the Redmi Note 4 and it sports great specs, fantastic build quality and it costs less than $170. Learn more in the full Gizmochina’s review.. Thanks to Giztop for sending. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x for a review.. Inside the box, you can find a charger, some paperwork, SIM ejector pin and USB cable.. The front of the phone looks just like previous Note-series devices. We have a sharp and bright 5.5” 1080p LCD display. In fact, it looks even better than a great display found on the Redmi Note 4.. We also have nicely backlit capacitive buttons and a highly customizable notification LED light.. The Note 4x is made of metal and it definitely feels premium but I was disappointed that the top and bottom parts of the backplate are made of plastic not like on the all-metal Note 4.. We have a 13MP shooter on the back, which is coupled with the dual-LED flash. Xiaomi phones are known for great fingerprint scanners and the Redmi Note 4x is no exception. You can unlock your phone very quickly straight from the standby mode.. The buttons feel nice and tactile, and we have some extra features like the IR blaster to control devices like TVs.. Xiaomi decided to stick with the micro USB port on this phone, which is not a deal-breaker but I would prefer the USB-C.. As for loudspeaker, I would say it is pretty good as on most of the Xiaomi phones. However, there is a little bit of distortion going on at the highest volume settings. The sound quality via the headset jack is pretty good too.. I have a standard edition of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x that sports an octa-core Snapdragon 625 chip with the max. clock speeds of 2.0GHz, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, which is also expandable via the microSD card slot. If you are willing to pay extra, you can get a 64GB model with 4GB of RAM.. The gaming performance is great and the Snapdragon 625 chip does not heat up so quickly. Games like Asphalt 8 run fine on the highest graphics with just a few skipped frames but that didn’t bother me at all.. When it comes to the user interface, the Redmi Note 4x ships with the MIUI 8, which uses Android 6.0 as a foundation. My review unit ships with the global ROM that has Google Play services pre-installed and Chinese bloatware removed.. I love how fast the phone is on the daily basis even after installing quite a few apps. So far, the phone has been working fine and I didn’t have any lag.. As usual, there are plenty of customization options Xiaomi phones have been famous for. Just to name a few, you can adjust display settings, choose from a variety of themes, customize the capacitive buttons or change the colors of the LED notification light. If you want to customize the phone even further, there are a lot more other features to play with.. We have a familiar camera app that allows you to take pictures very fast. You can also play with some basic shooting modes and settings. you can adjust some image properties using the manual mode.. For a $170 phone, the pictures taken with the Redmi Note 4X look quite nice and there is a good amount of detail in most of the daylight shots. However, there were a few pictures with softer focus and inaccurate-looking colors.. When it comes to the low-light photography, the Redmi Note 4x is a pretty good performer. Sure, you can’t expect wonders from a $170 phone but the images are one of the best in class. In fact, I see the improvement over the Redmi Note 4, meaning that the Xiaomi finally improved its noise reduction algorithms.. The video quality is pretty good but it could definitely have more detail and look sharper.. As for selfie camera, a 5MP shooter can produce quite good selfies that will be more than enough for social media Unfortunately, the stock camera app allows you to shoot only in 720p with the front facing camera. On the other hand, the quality of the footage is pretty good and the sound recording quality is decent for a cheap phone.. The phone comes with a hybrid dual-SIM card tray, which can take either 2 SIMs or 1 SIM and the microSD card.. As for connectivity, everything has been working fine. I didn’t have any issues with Wifi that works fine on both 2.4 and 5GHz bands. Also, the GPS has been very accurate and finally, the call quality along with the signal reception have been great.. A huge 4100mAh battery has been phenomenal. I could use the phone for 2 days easily even with some heavy usage. That translates to over 7 hours of screen-on time. You can achieve even better results if you are going to use the phone just for the basic stuff.. Although the Snapdragon 625 supports Quick Charge 3.0 technology for fast charging, Xiaomi does not include the fast charger in the box and it takes about 2.5h to fully charge the phone.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x is yet another budget offering by the Chinese giant and I have to say that it is a great phone for the price of $170.. The device sports a very good built quality and it uses metal in the construction. Also, we have one of the best-in-class displays, feature-rich user interface and the phone can handle 3D games quite well. In addition, the battery life is fantastic. Finally, the camera can take some pretty good pictures.. A few minor shortcomings would be that the phone still uses the micro USB charging port, not the USB-C port. Also, the phone does not ship with the fast charger and finally, the top and bottom parts of the backplate are made of plastic, which is kind of a downgrade from the Redmi Note 4.. The question is: should you upgrade if you already have the Redmi Note 4. I would say no, since this phone is just an incremental upgrade. However, if you are in the market for a solid budget-friendly phone, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x should be definitely on your list as it is an easy buying recommendation for the price of under $170.. If you are in the market for a solid budget-friendly phone, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x should be definitely on your list as it is an easy buying recommendation for the price of under $170..
