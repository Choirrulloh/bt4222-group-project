Yes (LG TONE INFINIM,™ LG TONE Active™, LG TONE ULTRA™, LG TONE PRO™ ). K330 Silver Reviews - page 2. Rated 4 out of. Very good middle of the road phone. The K330 worked well under nearly all conditions, except when it was running out of internal memory, which, unfortunately, happened with too many apps were demanding attention.. Rated 5 out of. Great phone with one flaw which is the internal storage. +ergonomics, the back buttons never get in the way and it made me prefer this position rather than in the side because it is easier to access.. +decent camera that is able to take good pictures in good lighting. +micro sd support, good for storing images,videos,photos, and sections of apps to save some space. +phone can run popular apps perfectly (instagram, pokemon go,messenger, clash royale). - internal storage, if you are planning to have many social apps they might not all fit on the phone.You have to be selective and try to disable apps that you don't use.. -good first smart phone that would be perfect with extra external storage. recommended for people that want a budget smart phone for some apps, browsing, and ok photo taking.. Rated 5 out of. I downloaded android pay only to find out that I couldn't use it in store. Upon deleting the app, I found that I couldn't take the pin off my phone. I am so happy I was able to get help by calling in. Anyone else with the issue should call them, there were too many steps to post here.. Rated 3 out of. This phone is acceptable at best. On one hand, it's practically indestructible with the right case, but it also freezes and lags a lot. There's way too much bloatware that you simply can't get rid of. I've downloaded four apps altogether that amount to barely less than a gigabyte, yet still struggle to have more than 200mb of space open at any given time. I expected a lot of customization with an Android phone, but quickly found that there's legit no way to add custom lockscreen widgets, which was kind of frustrating. The front and back camera? Both subpar at best.. This phone is probably good for your grandparents or a ten-year-old, because it can't handle a lot but does get the job done.. Rated 1 out of. Half of Memory Used by System. I picked up this phone thinking I would put a 32 GB SD Card in it. NONE of the apps will move to it. This is a problem, since half the memory is taken up by system processes and the other half by just a few apps. The apps update and use up more memory. File Manager doesn't included the apps for whatever reason, so you're stuck. The camera sucks and the double tap screen is touchy. Rated 2 out of. This phone has a good camera and great amount of storage but it overheats easily and my headphones wont fit in it! I have tried cleaning the port and everything but my headphone jack keeps falling right out. Sorry but Im never getting an LG again.. Rated 4 out of. 1st time owner and IT FITS IN YOUR POCKET!!. Needed a smartphone that was easy to use and FITS IN YOUR POCKET! A sales rep. needs her phone all the time! I love the ability to block either or both phone #s and text messages and places them in a separate area; so it won't interfere with your life and you can still read them if you choose. The major problem I'm having now, are the unknown blocked calls going to my voice mail. If a call is blocked, it should stop there, not continue on to harass you. T-mobile and the police cant help because the number is not visible. Changing my phone # 2xs so far is unacceptable. KEEP READING...One negative won't discourage me at all from buying another LG. AND one of the best things that most people won't believe is I've dropped this phone maybe 6xs onto hard cement and NOT one crack or scratch. Purchased separately non LG product, a thin clear plastic film and a no name no frills plastic green back. So YES, ITS THE LG PHONE THAT IS MADE WELL ENOUGH to avoid getting damaged from life.. Rated 3 out of. I bought this, and 3 others on a plan I switched over to from Verizon. Even won't work when the touch pad is used to open the phone. Service atbthe retail location is very unhelpful..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Take vanity to the next level with LG's selfie-optimized K7 smartphone (hands-on). by January 4, 2016 10:52 AM PST. Mid-level LG K7 for Boost debuts at CES 2016 (pictures). LG K7 ups your selfie game. 5-inch display LTE Model: 1.1GHz quad-core CPU 3G Model: 1.3 GHz quad-core CPU 16 or 8GB internal storage; 1.5 or 1GB RAM 5-megapixel front-facing camera Variants will offer an 8- or 5-megapixel rear camera 2,125mAh batery. If you're anything like me, you probably can't count the number of times you've needed to take a photo of yourself in a dimly lit area. Enter the LG K7, a 5-inch smartphone running Android 5.1 Lollipop, and equipped with many of LG's selfie-minded optimizations -- including a front-facing flash.. Leave those clunky selfie sticks at home, friends. With Gesture Shot, you need only hold your hand in front of the camera, and close it into a fist to start a timer and take your selfie. Open and close your hand twice, and the front-facing camera will take four consecutive photos -- perfect for creating that camera booth vibe while you're waiting for the bus, or in the bathroom at work.. The smartphones that matter at CES 2016 (pictures). Taking a selfie on the K7.. And with the front-facing Flash for Selfie, your next "I'm walking home" tweet or Instagram post will be brightly lit, accurately capturing your face and the pedestrians walking around you.. The K7 will be among the first to offer LG's new "glossy pebble design language," which means it has a curved, round body. Like many of LG's recent devices, including the selfie-friendly LG V10 , the buttons have been moved away from the sides of the device and onto the rear, which lends the display rather thin bezels along the side.. Alas, hardware details are scant, and we don't have complete word on a price or availability. What we do know is that it will at least come to the US on Boost Mobile some time during Q1. Models will also vary by region, with different hardware and colors determined by whether you opt for LTE, or grab a 3G model. Stay tuned for more, when we get a chance to try these selfie-features for ourselves here at CES 2016.. Mid-level LG K7 for Boost debuts at CES 2016 (pictures).

The LG K7 is one of the most affordable phones you can get on T-Mobile, but many more powerful options are available unlocked for similar or less money.. The LG K7 is your standard entry-level phone. Available on T-Mobile for $139.99, it offers decent performance, good network connectivity, and a fairly attractive, sturdy design. But the handset also illustrates the leaps and bounds unlocked phones have made over the last year in relation to carrier offerings. Both the Motorola Moto G4 Play and the Blu R1 HD get you better hardware and more up-to-date Android software for nearly the same price (or lower). And both phones work on T-Mobile, so there's little reason to pick the K7 instead.. Design, Features, and Display The LG K7 is a fairly standard black polycarbonate slab, but it bucks expectations by adding some curves. The front is covered in a layer of glass that bends gently to meet the sides, while the back cover is made of grippy plastic. It feels sturdy, and has a nicer look and feel than the ZTE Avid Plus .. View All 6 Photos in Gallery. The compact K7 measures 5.7 by 2.9 by 0.4 inches (HWD) and weighs 4.9 ounces, which is roughly the same size and weight as the G4 Play (5.7 by 2.8 by 0.4 inches, 4.8 ounces) and the R1 HD (5.6 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.0 ounces). It's nearly an ounce lighter than the Avid Plus, despite both phones having the same overall dimensions. You'll have no trouble using the K7 with one hand.. The handset has LG's signature rear power button, with a pair of volume buttons above and below. Peeling the back cover off gives you access to a removable battery, a SIM card slot, and a microSD card slot that worked fine with a 256GB Samsung Evo+ card. The bottom has a micro USB charging port and a 3.5mm audio jack for headphones.. A 5-inch, 854-by-480 IPS LCD used to be for entry-level phones a couple of years ago, but now it just looks dated. Working out to a paltry 196 pixels per inch (ppi), the display isn't nearly as sharp at the 720p panels on the R1 HD and the G4 Play (both 294ppi). Some pixelation is noticeable upon close inspection, though colors are accurate and viewing angles are good. Outdoor use isn't so great, as the display doesn't get very bright and tends to be a bit reflective, making it difficult to see in direct sunlight.. Network Performance and Connectivity The K7 operates on T-Mobile's GSM network and supports LTE bands 2, 4, and 12, offering the same connectivity as the Avid Plus. You'll find a more comprehensive set of bands on the G4 Play, which is compatible with every major US carrier, including Sprint and Verizon. That said, network performance on the K7 was solid in testing. The phone showed download speeds up to 19Mbps in midtown Manhattan. It supports Wi-Fi connectivity on the 2.4GHz band.. Transmissions are clear and noise cancellation is solid, making it easy to carry on a conversation in a noisy environment. Voices can have a somewhat raspy, robotic quality to them, but it doesn't impact overall clarity.. Processor, Battery, and Camera The K7's Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 processor is another piece of hardware that used to be standard for entry-level phones a while back but just feels dated next to the current crop of unlocked handsets. Despite an undemanding display, the K7 scored a low 15,375 on the AnTuTu benchmark, which tests overall system performance. That's less than the Avid Plus (20,252), which has the same hardware. And it's about half as much as the Snapdragon 410-powered G4 Play (28,647) and the MediaTek 6735-powered R1 HD (31,847). The K7 was unable to complete GFXBench, which tests graphics performance.. See How We Test Cell Phones. However, if you're just looking for standard functionality, the K7 can handle apps like Camera, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Messages, and YouTube without much difficulty. It has 1.5GB of RAM, which allows for a light degree of multitasking, but trying to do too much will cause slowdowns and force background apps to close. High-end games aren't playable, but simple ones like Angry Birds run fine.. The phone clocked 5 hours and 57 minutes when we set screen brightness to maximum and streamed full-screen video over LTE. That's exactly the same amount of runtime as the R1 HD, but nearly two hours less than the G4 Play's impressive 7 hours and 50 minutes. You should still get a day's worth of average use out of the K7, and the battery is removable so you can carry a spare and swap it out as needed.. The K7 has matching 5-megapixel camera sensors on the front and back that are surprisingly divergent in image quality. The rear-facing sensor takes muddy pictures, even in well-lit outdoor settings. Autoexposure is particularly poor, as several pictures I took of a sunny street looked shadowed in darkness. Indoors, blur and grain predominate and the camera is often unable to find focus. You can record 720p video at 30fps, but it suffers from the same issues.. The 5-megapixel front-facing camera is another story. Pictures I took outside were clear, and autoexposure had no difficulty. Overall, the K7's rear camera is worse than the R1 HD, the G4 Play, and the Avid Plus, but its front-facing sensor matches or surpasses the lot of them.. Software The K7 ships running the outdated Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. We don't expect it to get an updates to Android 6.0 Marshmallow , let alone Android 7.0. There's a heavy custom UI layer running on top with changes to app icons, the Settings menu, and the .. There isn't much in the way of features, though, because there isn't a lot of room to put them. The phone only comes with 8GB of storage, and leaves just half (3.94GB) for your own use. The paucity of storage isn't helped by the presence of bloatware. There are nine T-Mobile apps, one Amazon app, and an LG app pre-installed. Only the LG app can be removed; the rest can only be disabled.. Conclusions The LG K7 feels solid, offers good network connectivity, and can run most basic apps for $140. That might have been good enough a couple of years ago, but it's lacking in many departments compared with a lot of the affordable unlocked phones available today. For just $10 more, the Moto G4 Play gets you a 720p display, a solid camera, excellent battery life, and compatibility with every US carrier. For $90 less, the Blu R1 HD also has a 720p display and much better performance, making it our Editors' Choice for affordable phones. Either is a better option for T-Mobile customers.. Bottom Line: The LG K7 is one of the most affordable phones you can get on T-Mobile, but many more powerful options are available unlocked for similar or less money..

Rose, 28 Jun 2017 Feeling sad and confused with the rewies, i m using this phone. I have been using this same phone for a little over a year and it's got everything to keep me happy. I'm not a gamer and I don't use a phone to watch videos. I take lord of pictures and this phone does an excellent job. Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews. those people evidently seem to have more needs than a good phone. I only use my phone for actually calling people, pictures and texting. I have an lk7 every time I ask a question it says something different it's not a smartphone it's a f****** stupid phone it's going to be one of the worst phones I've ever used in my entire life I don't know why they call it a smartphone.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars My aunt says yes.. Bought this for my aunt whose Iphone recently stopped working. I wanted a budget alternative to replace her phone so I got this and was pleasantly surprised. She loves it and says that its easier for her to use. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Mine Came With A Dead Wasp In The Box!. This phone is great if you are looking for a backup phone or a phone for someone who doesn't need a whole lot. The only odd thing is the button on the back is the main button for the phone. Other than that, this phone was able to make great calls, sync with bluetooth headsets / car, and does a decent job handling games and youtube videos. FOR THE PRICE, this is an excellent handset. The only real complaint that I have is that mine came with a wasp in the box. It was dead, and had been for a very long time, but the rattling made me think that something was wrong with the phone. Glad to know it was just an old toasty wasp.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars This phone works on reconfigured T-Mobile towers!. I've never tried a larger phone, so this is an experiment. I like that my other phone (an iPhone 6) fits in my pocket, but the LG K7 too big, especially with the case on it. OTOH, the large screen size make web surfing more enjoyable, and I might even try reading Kindle books on it. If you can find a used one in excellent condition, it's a great value. Even new at $90, I'd buy it again. I cannot justify spending hundreds on a current model phone when it will be likely be obsolete in a few years when 5G speeds kick in. tl;dr I had to replace my older phone when T-Mobile changed the cellular communication bands on cell towers in my area. Suddenly in June 2017, my old LG phone would no longer function at 4G LTE speed for data, and would barely get 2G speeds. Some of you may have experienced this, too. T-Mobile then tried to convince me that the only phones that would work on the reconfigured towers are the ones currently for sale on their website. Even though T-Mobile's changes are forcing me to upgrade, they didn't offer me any kind of discount on a new phone, even thought they constantly thank me for being a long-time customer whenever I contact them. Instead of dropping hundreds of dollars on a new phone from the T-Mobile website, I researched used phones, to locate one that uses the bands that currently work on T-Mobile towers, and settled on this K7 for $55 used (plus $5 shipping, from the excellent seller JNOVA.) I love it, and am getting used to the large size. I don't recommend buying a used phone locked into a carrier and then trying get it unlocked. Don't buy this phone unless you intend to use it with T-Mobile. I'm grandfathered in with two cell lines and tons of 4G LTE data for a low rate, which is why I didn't quit T-Mobile when they changed the bands on the cell towers. I imagine the other carriers are making similar changes, and we'll all have to give up our ancient cell phones.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars VERY beautiful phone for this price. VERY beautiful phone for this price. The Internet works very well compared to my old version of LG. Nano Sim card from T-Mobile was not attached. In the nearest store, my old micro-sized card was cut to size nano by a special device, and they asked only $ 5 for this. At short, I am happy with this phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Wont recognize sim, terrible customer service. Despite what people may say, it DOES NOT come with a SIM card. In fact, this phone wouldnt even recognize the SIM card once I got one and plugged it in. (yes it was a properly activated tmobile sim card purchased thru tmobile). Getting a replacement from the seller has been a headache and still no success. I would not recommend this phone or the people selling it if you are looking for an easy quick replacement phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Very happy with the outcome. Was just what I was looking for, didn't work as well as anticipated, was able to talk to the seller and work out a solution. Very happy with the outcome, would order from seller again, very cooperative, and was willing to keep this customer happy. Thank you! Love this phone, used this model for years, and passed in on to kids, then order more for more kids, great starter product for the kiddos and also and older adult. They are all happy, so I am happy too!!. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Don't recommend. Already the battery will not hold a charge. I'm not a heavy user and don't have a lot of apps. Cuts itself off for no reason. Not like the LG products I've has in the past.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great Phone!. Husband's phone broke and it was this exact phone, that's why we decided to order it again! His phone broke because he smashed it on accident! Haven't had any problems with this phone. Even better than my iPhone 6.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 1.0 out of 5 stars One Star. The phone came on the date it was supposed to. My daughter opened it on Christmas and we realized the battery would not charge.. 3.0 out of 5 stars Great price. My daughter opened it on Christmas and ....

LG K7 or LG Tribute 5 is an affordable Android phone meant for prepaid carriers, like Boost Mobile in the US. Its 5-inch display and plastic design look and feel okay if you can handle the lower resolution 480p display.. LG K10 design LG K7 display LG K7 specs Early verdict. LG K7 is a budget phone that didn't make the cut at the company's CES press conference. However, this low-key Android did show up on the Las Vegas convention floor.. It's an Android smartphone with a palmable 5-inch display and a respectable plastic design with a matte finish. In the US, it'll be known as the LG Tribute 5 on Boost Mobile.. Whether you see it in stores as the LG K7 or the LG Tribute 5, it's destined for prepaid carriers with an affordable price tag. It's as far from the LG G4 as you can get.. Just 480p, but looks good at all angles. That said, while wasn't the flashiest phone at CES 2016, it runs Android and doesn't exhibit any noticeable slowdown. It's a budget phone that looks slightly nicer than the Moto E .. There's very little difference between the LG K7 and the LG K10, as both new phones exhibit the South Korean company's pebble curved design language. This one is just less glossy.. It's an LG phone, so the buttons are around back as always. The power key and volume rocker sit right underneath the rear camera, instead of on the side of the phone.. Buttons are on back instead of the frame, a signature of the LG design. The smooth 2.5D Arc Glass is a design that wouldn't be possible with big buttons on the frame, and it all accentuates the clutter-free design of the LG K7.. It's easier to hold without my hands trying to inartfully avoid side buttons. But it's also prone to me smudging the camera when mispressing the out-of-sight buttons.. LG K7 has a more basic matte finish for a subdued look compared to the glossy, woven pattern of the LG K10, and it comes in a Titan carbon gray color at a smaller 143.6 x 72.5 x 8.9mm size.. At 480p, the 5-inch LG K7 display doesn't quite measure up to resolution of most 1080p Android phones. It doesn't even reach the 720p potential of the LG K10.. It takes decent photos and has gesture shot, but the display is still a low resolution to view them. Instead, it relies on the low pixel count of its 480 x 854 resolution and its FWVGA In-cell Touch technology.I didn't have trouble seeing between the 196 pixels per inch with my naked eye.. The good news is that I also didn't have trouble seeing the screen from all angles. It's bright and viewable, and I hope that remains true once I test it outside in the final LG K7 review.. LG made its K Series phones an adequate enough performer on a budget. Although the K7 is technically slower than the K10, I found it to be speedy given it's a lightweight 480p device.. There's a humble quad-core processor beneath this cover. It doesn't need much to power through the basic Android apps, and the LTE model I demoed had a 1.1GHz quad-core processor. There's a 3G with a 1.3GHz quad-core chip, too.. It has 16GB of internal storage onboard with 1.5GB of RAM, though there's also an entry-level option for 8GB of storage with 1GB of RAM that's best avoided.. With a 5-inch display, it's easy to hold in one hand. An 8MP rear camera and 5MP front-facing camera come with many of the LG bells and whistles like gesture shot, gesture interval shot and a screen-lit "flash" for front-facing selfies.. LG K7 runs Android 5.1 Lollipop, which means it hasn't hopped on Android 6.0 Marshmallow's energy-savings bandwagon yet, but it does boast a decently sized 2,125mAh battery.. In the low price vs premium balance, this phone favors those looking for a low price. The LG K7 does its best impression of a pricier LG phone without increasing the price or the 480p resolution. It has a lot of the styling cues of the flagship LG G4.. You're not going to fool anyone with the LG K7, however, and the same applies to the nicer, but also technically limited LG K10. They're budget phones doing their best impression of premium.. However, the K7 runs Android 5.1 and will arrive as the LG Tribute 5 at prepaid carriers in the US like Boost Mobile. That's enough for the younger LG is targeting with this budget handset.. What is a hands on review?.

MetroPCS Terms and Conditions of Service. When you initiate Service with MetroPCS, you may receive a Start of Service form and this Agreement. These materials, including applicable supplemental terms and conditions, and your Rate Plan terms, are part of your Agreement with MetroPCS (collectively, the “Agreement”). This Agreement governs the sale, use, and delivery of MetroPCS wireless services ("Service" or "Services") to you (the purchaser or user of the Services) by T-Mobile USA, Inc. and any of its controlled subsidiaries, assignees, and agents ("us," "we," "our" or "MetroPCS"). Certain other laws may also govern our provision of Services to you and such laws are incorporated in their entirety by this reference into this Agreement as if set forth in this Agreement. Your Service is also subject to, and you agree to adhere to, our business policies, practices, and procedures, which we can change at any time without notice to you (collectively, the "Policies"). Offers may not be available everywhere or combinable with other promotions/options. Your Rate Plan includes your allotments for minutes, messages or data, rates, coverage and other terms (“Rate Plan”). The Agreement makes up the complete agreement between you and us, and supersedes any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements, arrangements, representations, advertising, contracts, statements, offers, and understandings relating to the subject matter of the Agreement, whether oral or written, including, but not limited to, all previous versions of the Terms and Conditions of Service. You cannot rely on any other documents or statements by any sales person, service representative or other agent. You acknowledge and agree that you have not relied on any representation, assertion, guarantee, warranty, contract or other assurance, stated or made by anyone except those set out in this Agreement.. IMPORTANT : READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES THE USE OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN LITIGATION BECAUSE IT USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY AND ALLOWS FOR LESS DISCOVERY AND LESS APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.. YOUR AGREEMENT WITH METROPCS STARTS WHEN YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU AGREE TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND POLICIES BY DOING ANY OF THE FOLLOWING: (A) GIVING US A WRITTEN OR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE, OR TELLING US ORALLY THAT YOU ACCEPT; (B) ACTIVATING OR CONTINUING SERVICE; (C) USING YOUR SERVICE AFTER YOUR SERVICE IS ACTIVATED OR YOU MAKE A CHANGE OR ADDITION TO YOUR SERVICE; (D) PAYING FOR THE SERVICE; OR (E) FAILING TO ACTIVATE SERVICE WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE PURCHASE OF YOUR WIRELESS DEVICE.. IF YOU ARE A NEW CUSTOMER AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT DO ANY OF THESE THINGS.. IF YOU ARE AN EXISTING CUSTOMER AND THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED TO YOU UNDER A PRIOR AGREEMENT AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST TERMINATE SERVICE AS SET FORTH IN THE PRIOR AGREEMENT ; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IF YOU CHOOSE TO TERMINATE SERVICE YOU WILL STILL BE BOUND BY THE PRIOR AGREEMENT, INCLUDING YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY ANY OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS AND YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, DO NOT ACTIVATE OR USE YOUR SERVICE, AND CONTACT METROPCS OR ITS AUTHORIZED DEALERS TO HAVE YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED.. We each agree that, except as provided below, any and all claims or Disputes between you and us, in any way related to or concerning the Agreement, our Privacy Policy, our Services, devices or products, will be resolved by binding arbitration. This includes any claims against other parties relating to Services or wireless devices provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers, Dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding. "Dispute" shall be given the broadest possible meaning and shall include any dispute, claim, or controversy arising from or relating to this Agreement or Services and/or Products provided under this Agreement, including but not limited to: (1) all claims for relief and all theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, fraud, or misrepresentation; (2) all disputes regarding the validity, enforceability or scope of this arbitration agreement (with the exception of its class action waiver); (3) all disputes that arose before this Agreement; (4) all disputes that arise after the termination of this Agreement; and (5) all disputes that are the subject of a putative class action in which no class has been certified. References in this provision to "us" include our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns and our and their directors, officers, employees and agents. References in this provision to "you" include all beneficiaries of this Agreement and all users of the Services provided under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court or bring Disputes to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, but not limited to, the Federal Communications Commission.. If you do not wish to be bound by this arbitration agreement, you must notify us of your desire to do so within 30 days of initiating Service, or, if you have never had the opportunity to opt out of arbitration, within 30 days of the date of the change notice giving you the opportunity. To do so, please visit www.metropcsdisputeresolution.com and follow the instructions on that site. Your decision to opt out of this arbitration agreement will not adversely affect our relationship with or delivery of Service to you. If you have previously notified us of your decision to opt out of this arbitration agreement, you need not do so again.. For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to the address in Section 16 below. We each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. If we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration. We each agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or this Agreement.. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if we change this arbitration agreement, you may reject the change without terminating or adversely affecting your Service by notifying us in writing at the address set forth in the "Notices" section below within 30 days of the date of the change notice. If you do, you shall arbitrate any Dispute in accordance with the terms of this arbitration agreement. If you do not, you will be bound by the changes.. Because this Agreement and the Services provided under this Agreement concern interstate commerce, this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA").. The party initiating arbitration may choose from the following independent, impartial arbitration administrators:. Copies of their respective rules for consumer disputes and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration may be obtained by contacting them or visiting their websites. Any arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the arbitration administrator's rules for consumer disputes in effect when the arbitration is initiated except to the extent they are inconsistent with this arbitration agreement. If the arbitration administrator will not enforce this arbitration agreement as written, the parties shall agree on or mutually petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a substitute arbitration administrator who will do so. The arbitrator shall enforce contractual, statutory and other limitation periods and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.. If we initiate the arbitration, we will notify you in writing at your then-current account address or (if your account is closed) the last address at which we contacted you. If you initiate the arbitration, you must notify us in writing at the address set forth in the "Notices" section below.. If your Dispute does not exceed $10,000, we will promptly reimburse your filing fee and will pay the arbitrator's other fees, costs and expenses. (If you cannot pay the filing fee, you may request that we pay the filing fee directly.) If, however, the arbitrator finds that your Dispute is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, you shall reimburse the filing fee to us and the payment of the arbitrator's others fees, costs and expenses shall be governed by the arbitration administrator's rules.. You may hire an attorney to represent you in the arbitration proceeding and may recover your reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration to the same extent as you could in court if the arbitration proceeding is decided in your favor. We may hire an attorney to represent us in the arbitration proceeding but waive any right to recover our attorneys' fees and costs if the arbitration proceeding is decided in our favor.. Unless you and we agree otherwise in writing, any arbitration hearings will be held in the county of your then-current account address or (if your account is closed) the last address at which we contacted you.. If the arbitration provision applies or you choose arbitration to resolve your disputes, then either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent (see Section 16) to begin arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will arbitrate all disputes. For claims less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that total less than $75,000. For claims that total more than $75,000, the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees. In addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Except for claims determined to be frivolous, Metro PCS agrees not to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you.. If you choose to pursue your claim in court by opting out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action Waiver provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out requirements above.. If a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration,. WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL .. ARBITRATION INVOLVES A FAIR HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR RATHER THAN A JUDGE OR JURY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY NAMED IN THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, or otherwise in this Agreement, neither party has the right to bring a Dispute or other legal action under this Agreement more than one (1) year after the Dispute arose.. If you terminate your Service, your termination will be effective at the end of your current month of Service (unless you port-out your number), and you will remain responsible for all fees and Charges for your Service and usage through the end of that period. If we terminate your Service, we will determine the date of termination, and you will be responsible for all usage and Charges through the date of termination. You can request that we port your number to another carrier, and Service for that number will be terminated when the porting is complete.. If you port your number, you will be responsible for all usage and Charges until the port-out is complete.. The Services are provided via Rate Plans under which you do not pay metered "per minute" charges for service. In an effort to offer this Service on a reliable basis, MetroPCS may discontinue providing Service to you, change the services provided to you, change your Rate Plan, reduce the speed of any service provided, restrict the amount of use of any service, change the services and features in your Rate Plan, discontinue your account, or discontinue or limit providing connections to particular telephone numbers, countries, destinations, providers, features, requested or called by you or the provision of certain services in certain areas, such as pursuant to roaming arrangements, or services that appear likely to generate abnormally high use, or other disproportionate use when compared to those of other customers of MetroPCS (as described below under Section 24 "Your Use Of The Service") or which may be harmful, disruptive, or interfere with MetroPCS' system or services to other customers. We may provide notice to you prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, but you acknowledge and agree that we are not required to provide notice and you agree that we may take any of the foregoing actions without providing notice you. By initiating service and placing calls or using any other service on the MetroPCS system, you acknowledge and agree to MetroPCS' ability to modify or terminate your Service under these circumstances.. For MetroPCS Device and accessory returns and exchanges, see the applicable return policy, which is available at your place of purchase. Amounts paid for Service charges are non-refundable.. If your Service is terminated for any reason and you have a positive balance in your Service account, you will not be entitled to receive any refund.. This Section describes how changes may be made to your Agreement, is subject to requirements and limitations imposed by applicable law, and will not be enforced to the extent prohibited by law. We may change the price and structure of your Rate Plan, modify the various Rate Plans, change the price of the various Rate Plans, change the services included in a Rate Plan, or change the requirements of eligibility for Rate Plans, at any time without prior notice to you. You may designate others to manage or make changes to your account ("Authorized Users"). You and any Authorized Users on your account will have access to all account information. If you give your personal account validation information to someone, they can access, and may be able to make changes to your account just as you can, including incurring charges for which you are responsible. Those changes will be binding on you. MetroPCS takes no responsibility for changes made to your account by any Authorized User.. With respect to domestic long distance, roaming, international long distance, and any other service provided by us (or to us by third parties), we may change the locations and destinations where such Services may be used or where calls can be placed or placed in specific Rate Plans, or the rates and terms applicable to such locations and destinations, without prior notice to you. Certain charges may be imposed by third parties and MetroPCS may, as an accommodation, allow such charges to be paid through MetroPCS.. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THESE RATE PLAN CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THE RATE PLAN CHANGES, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE CHANGE THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT NOTIFY US THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE WITHIN THAT TIME AND/OR IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICE AFTER THE RATE PLAN CHANGES, YOU ACCEPT THE CHANGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMINATION, AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.. We may change this Agreement at any time. If you are an existing customer, you will be notified at least ten (10) days, unless a longer period is required, in advance of any proposed changes that may result in more restrictive terms or conditions in this Agreement. Any such changes to this Agreement will be effective after that time period.. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THE CHANGES, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE CHANGE NOTICE THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT NOTIFY US THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE WITHIN THAT TIME AND/OR IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICE AFTER NOTIFICATION OF THE CHANGES, YOU ACCEPT THE CHANGES.. * Your Wireless Device and Compatibility with Other Networks and Equipment. You may buy a wireless device to use on our Service from us or someone else, but it must, as solely determined by us, comply with Federal Communications Commission regulations, be certified for use on our network, and be compatible with, and not potentially harm, our Service or our network. Our Services will only work with wireless devices compatible with our network and not all services are available with all wireless devices or on all networks. Some features and Rate Plans will be available only on MetroPCS wireless devices purchased from us. At times we may remotely change your wireless device's software, applications or programming, without notice to address security, safety, or other issues that impact our network or your device. These changes will modify your wireless device and may affect or erase data you have. stored on your wireless device, or how you have programmed or use your wireless device. A MetroPCS wireless device is designed to be used only with our service and on our network. Your wireless device may not work with another wireless network, or the other wireless carrier may not accept your wireless device on its network. If your wireless device was purchased from MetroPCS or an authorized MetroPCS dealer, the wireless device has a software programming lock that will prevent the wireless device from operating with other compatible wireless telephone carriers' services. Please see www.metropcs.com/unlockpolicy for information regarding our software programming unlocking policy. Your wireless device may contain sensitive or personal information. MetroPCS is not responsible for any information on your wireless device, including sensitive or personal information. If possible, you should remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive or personal information when your wireless device is out of your possession or control, including, but not limited to, relinquishing, exchanging, returning or recycling your wireless device. By providing your wireless device to us, you agree that our employees, contractors or vendors may access all of the information on your wireless device.. Service is limited to the operating range, spectrum, and capacity of our, or our roaming partners’, wireless system in your service area. Your Service area is the area depicted in the coverage map available to you when you activated Service and may change from time to time without notice. Since MetroPCS uses different spectrum in different areas of the country, service may not be available on all wireless devices in all areas. We may, but are not obligated to, provide notice when you are being served by a carrier other than ourselves. The specific network coverage you get will depend on the radio transmissions your wireless device can receive and use, and the Services you have chosen. Specific Services may not be available on all wireless devices at all points in time due to wireless device hardware and/or software, changes to our network, network infrastructure, cessation of specific Services, or service by carriers other than ourselves. Except for 911 calls and any "roaming" service to which you have subscribed, you will not be able to use your wireless device outside of your service area for any calls, including local, long distance and international calls. Further, since services outside MetroPCS' area are provided by third parties, not all services may work outside your service area. Service depends on over-the-air radio transmissions. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using Services outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage is not available everywhere and depends on the Service purchased and the wireless device used. Service speeds are not guaranteed and actual speeds will vary. Estimating wireless coverage, signal strength and Service speed is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that may result in dropped and/or blocked connections, slower Service speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of Service. Many factors beyond our control affect your ability to make and receive calls on your wireless device, the quality of those calls, and the speed of your Service including, but not limited to, your location, the conditions of the atmosphere, terrain, nearby buildings and other structures, network capacity issues, system outages, failure of equipment to operate as expected, spectrum used, problems that occur with service we purchase from third parties, system upgrades, performance of system maintenance, accidents, network problems, network or Internet congestion, software, signal strength, your wireless device, weather, geography, topography, server speeds of the websites you access or other events outside of our control. As a result, sometimes Service, including calls or attempted calls to emergency services like 911, may be unavailable, interrupted or may fail, and the quality of calls may sometimes be poor.. MetroPCS takes no responsibility for Service interruptions or problems caused by factors beyond our control. Any statements by MetroPCS, its employees, representatives or agents about the coverage of our system are intended only to describe MetroPCS' approximate coverage in your service area. You should not interpret any such statement to mean that Service will be available or without interruption in any service area.. Location Based Services; Important Emergency and 9-1-1 Information; and Emergency Alerts. When making a 911 call, always state the nature of your emergency and provide both your location and phone number, as the operator may not automatically receive this information.. MetroPCS is not responsible for failures to connect or complete 911 calls or if inaccurate location information is provided. 911 service may not be available or reliable and your ability to receive emergency services may be impeded.. Services that rely on location information, such as E911, GPS navigation, and our wireless network depend on your wireless device's ability to acquire satellite signals and network coverage. Unlike traditional wireline telephones, depending on a number of factors (for example, where you are, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their equipment, etc.), 911 operators may not know your telephone number, your location or the location of your wireless device. Other third party entities are involved in connecting a 911 call. MetroPCS makes no guarantee that emergency 911 calls will be routed to a specific Public Safety Answering Point ("PSAP") or any particular public safety organization (for example, police department, fire department, ambulance services, etc.). MetroPCS takes no responsibility for the acts or omissions of any PSAP or any public safety organization (for example, police department, fire department, ambulance services, etc.). In certain circumstances, an emergency call may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher or alternative location set by local emergency service providers. Enhanced 911 service ("E911"), where enabled by local emergency authorities, uses GPS or network technologies to provide location information. Even when available, however, E911 does not always provide accurate location information, and in some cases may not generate a location at all. If your wireless device is indoors or for some other reason cannot acquire a satellite signal, you may not be located. Some wireless devices have a safety feature that prevents use of the keypad after dialing 911. You should follow voice prompts when interacting with emergency service providers employing Interactive Voice Response ("IVR") systems to screen calls. While your wireless device is receiving a software update, you may be unable to use your wireless device in any manner until the software update is complete. If you are porting a phone number to or from us, we may not be able to provide you with some Services, such as 9-1-1 location services, while the port is in process. Your wireless device may require you to elect to use location based services, or you may choose to use location based services, other than E911. If you elect to use non-E911 location based services, you agree that we may use the location information transmitted from your wireless device to improve our location services. Your personal, biographical and calling information will not be used by us. By electing to use location based services, you agree and authorize us to send targeted, location based information to your mobile device and also to use or provide to third parties your location information in an aggregate form.. MetroPCS has chosen to offer wireless emergency alerts, within portions of its coverage area, on wireless alert capable Devices. There is no additional charge for these wireless emergency alerts. For details on the availability of this service and wireless emergency alert capable Devices, please visit https://www.metropcs.com/terms-conditions/wireless-emergency-alerts.html .. * Data Plans and Other Features. Depending on your Rate Plan, your usage of Data Access may be metered by Us. Your Rate Plan may include a Data Access usage limit, such as 2 GB per service cycle. We shall determine in our sole discretion what data usage constitutes Data Access and reserve the right to alter, make additions to or deletions to what type of data usage, or protocols, constitute Data Access without notification to you. Data Access may include, for example, multimedia streaming and video on demand services, as well as certain multimedia uploads, downloads and gaming services and applications. Uploads are data sessions where the data is transferred from your Wireless Device to some other computer or wireless device, while downloads are data sessions where the data is transferred from some other computer or wireless device to your Wireless Device. Depending on your Rate Plan, certain usages may not count against your Data Access limit. Data Access does not include any data services or uses which are prohibited by Us under this Agreement, such as in the MetroWEB Terms of Use. Data Access usage includes, but is not limited to, the actual data sent and received along with overhead, header packets, and may include other information sent in connection with a data session in which Data Access occurs. Data Access on networks not owned by us, such as when you are roaming, may not be available or may be further limited. Charges and availability are based on the location of the cell site receiving and transmitting the Data Access service and not your location.. The absolute capacity of the wireless data network is limited. Accordingly, Data Access is only provided for prescribed purposes and pricing for Data Access is device dependent and based on the transmit and receive capacity of each device. A Data Access pricing plan designated for one type of device may not be used with another device. Compatible data-enabled wireless devices are required.. You acknowledge and agree that your Data Access usage and speed may vary depending on certain factors outside of our control. Such factors may include the amount of users on the service, network congestion, the distance to the serving cell site, the number of users served by your serving cell site, the management of backhaul at the serving cell site, any application(s) you are using for your data session, the screen size of your Wireless Device, the bit rate(s) of your data session, the type(s) and amount(s) of compression used by the computers or wireless devices involved in the data session, and any error(s) that might occur in the data session. We also manage our network to facilitate the proper functioning of services that require consistent high speeds, such as video calling, which may, particularly at times and in areas of network congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services. Additionally, we may implement other network management practices, such as deploying streaming video optimization technology and prioritizing all Smartphone Mobile Hotspot (tethering) data below on-device data. This technology is intended to manage data usage on the network, reduce the risk of streaming video stalling and buffering, and reduce the amount of high-speed data consumption used for streaming video.. Streaming video optimization improves streaming video reliability as well as makes room for other users to enjoy higher browsing speeds.. The streaming video optimization process is agnostic as to the streaming video content itself and to the website that provides it.. While most changes to streaming video files are likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the streaming video as displayed on a user’s device. These practices operate without regard to the content itself or the source of the content, and do not discriminate against offerings that might compete against those offered by MetroPCS on the basis of such competition. In order to assess your usage during an applicable service cycle, you may obtain approximate usage information by using one of our automated systems. Any application on your Wireless Device which describes the amount of data usage does not necessarily reflect your usage of Data Access. We may provide a meter for your use in one or more locations accessible by you. Any meter provided for your use may deliver readings higher or lower than your actual Data Access usage, or deliver readings that are higher than your actual Data Access usage because of the units of measurement used by Us. Any reading delivered by any meter we provide for your use will have inherent inaccuracies and may not provide up to the minute or second accuracy. Further, any reading delivered by any meter We provide for your use may only be completely accurate if your Wireless Device is turned off and not transmitting or receiving any data from any data session.. MetroPCS reserves the right to manage our network and the traffic on our network in the way we believe best benefits our customers and best enables us to maintain Service of the nature described in this Agreement. We have determined that our ability to provide Service to our customers is disrupted when you place an abnormally high number of calls, repeatedly place calls which result in abnormally long call lengths, high or disproportionate use, or otherwise use our Services or network in excess of our expectations for the normal amount of use by our customers. Other examples of prohibited uses can be found in Section 17. If you use your service in a manner that could interfere with other customers’ service, affect our ability to allocate network capacity among customers or degrade service quality for other customers, we may suspend, terminate, or restrict your Service.. Some elements of multimedia messages may not be accessible, viewable, or heard due to limitations on certain wireless phones, PCs, or e-mail. We reserve the right to change the multimedia message size limit at any time without notification. Text message notifications may be sent to non-multimedia messaging subscribers if they subscribe to text messaging. You may receive unsolicited messages from third parties as a result of visiting Internet sites, and a per-message charge may apply whether the message is read or unread, solicited or unsolicited.. To differentiate the services we sell, at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, we give the data traffic of customers who choose T-Mobile-branded services precedence over the data traffic of customers who choose non-T-Mobile-branded services such as MetroPCS.. Where the network is lightly loaded, a MetroPCS customer will notice little, if any, effect from having lower priority. This will be the case in the vast majority of times and locations. At times and at locations where the network is heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, however, MetroPCS customers will likely see reductions in data speeds, especially if they are engaged in data-intensive activities. Customers on Rate Plans and Devices with 4G capability should, for example, be aware that these practices may occassionally result in speeds below those typically experienced on our 4G LTE and HSPA networks. MetroPCS constantly works to improve network performance and capacity, but there are physical and technical limits on how much capacity is available, and at constrained locations, the frequency of heavy loading in relation to available capacity may be greater than at other locations. When network loading goes down or the MetroPCS customer moves to a location that is less heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, the MetroPCS customer‘s speeds will likely improve. See www.metropcs.com/openinternet for details.. MetroPCS also reserves the right to restrict, or otherwise prevent access to services, countries, carriers, destinations that MetroPCS determines, in its sole discretion, are inconsistent with the nature of Service provided by MetroPCS, are indicative of uses not permitted hereunder, or result in abnormally long calls, or abnormally high usage. We also may block calls to telephone numbers at the request of the called party.. You can purchase Content and Applications (for example, downloadable, streaming or networked applications, wallpapers, ringtones, games, productivity tools and video) ("Content and Apps") for and with your compatible wireless device. Some Content and Apps that you can purchase with your wireless device are not sold by MetroPCS and for such Content and Apps, you can identify the third party seller at the point of purchase. MetroPCS is not responsible for such Content and Apps, including download, installation, use, transmission failure, interruption, or delay, or any content or website you may be able to access through the Content and Apps. Any support questions for such Content and Apps should be directed to the third party seller identified at the point of purchase. When you download or install any Content and Apps sold by a third party seller, you may be subject to license terms between you and the third party seller and Content and Apps creator/owner. When you use, install, display, run, or listen to Content and Apps that you purchase from MetroPCS, the Content and Apps are licensed to you by MetroPCS and may be subject to additional license terms between you and the creator/owner of the Content and Apps. Whether purchased from MetroPCS or a third party seller, any Content and Apps you purchase are licensed for personal, lawful, non-commercial use on your wireless device only. You may not transfer, copy, or reverse engineer any Content and Apps, or alter, disable or circumvent any digital rights management security features embedded in the Content and Apps. Content and Apps may not be transferable from one wireless device to another wireless device. You understand and agree that the Content and Apps contain the intellectual property of third parties. You understand and agree that the Content and Apps are protected by law (including copyright law) and are solely for your personal, non-commercial use. You agree to comply with all applicable laws (including copyright law), and may only make such copies as are reasonably necessary for your personal and non-commercial use. You agree that any other redistribution, reproduction, transmission, communication, sale, use (including, except in the case of Ringtones, as a "ringer" for a telephone), broadcast, public performance, rental or lending, adaptation, sub-license or other use of the Content and Apps without the prior written consent of the copyright owner is prohibited. You understand and agree that all rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by the applicable content owner.. Your location can be identified while using GPS applications. It is your responsibility to notify Authorized Users that their location can be identified while using GPS applications. If you use a third party application, the application may access, collect, use or disclose your personal information or require MetroPCS to disclose your information, including location information (when applicable), to the application provider or some other third party. If you access, use or authorize third party applications through the Services, you agree and authorize MetroPCS to provide information related to your use of the Services or the application(s). You understand that your use of third party applications is subject to the third party's terms and conditions and policies, including the third party's privacy policy. You agree that any Authorized User may access, use or authorize MetroPCS or third party location-sensitive applications through the Services. You understand that your use of such location-sensitive applications is subject to the application's terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy. If you activate location-sensitive services for wireless devices used by other Authorized Users, you agree to inform the Authorized User(s) of the terms of use for location-sensitive applications and that the wireless device may be located. For additional information on location-sensitive services, see our Privacy Policy at our website.. Your wireless device may connect to another provider’s network (“Off-Net”) even when you are within our service area. Our Services and Rate Plans are designed for you to use your Service each month predominantly using our networks. You must use your wireless device predominantly within the MetroPCS owned network coverage area. If your minutes of use, text messaging usage, or data usage are not predominantly on our networks ("Off-Net Usage"), or are excessive, abnormally high, or cause MetroPCS to incur too much cost, MetroPCS may, at its option and sole discretion, limit or terminate your service, deny your continued use outside the areas served by our network or on other carriers' coverage, or change your Rate Plan. MetroPCS will provide you with advance notice that it intends to take any of the above actions.. Nationwide roaming requires multi-band wireless devices and is not available with single-band wireless devices, certain other wireless devices, or to customers residing outside their home area. Data services and certain features (for example, Voicemail, Caller ID, Call Waiting, Location Services, etc.) may not be available in all roaming areas. The term "roaming" typically refers to coverage on another carrier's network that we may make available to you based on our agreements with other carriers. These agreements may change from time to time and roaming coverage and available services are subject to change without notice. Your ability to roam depends on the radio transmissions your wireless device can receive and use, and the availability of roaming coverage. We make no guaranty that roaming coverage will be available. Roaming coverage may exist both within and outside our network coverage areas. Depending on your Services, separate charges or limits on the amount of minutes used while roaming may apply. We may, but you agree we are not obligated to, provide you with notice when you are roaming. YOU AGREE TO HOLD METROPCS HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, ACTIONS, OR OTHER CAUSES OF ACTION (INCLUDING ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE SERVICE.. You agree to pay for all charges for Service ("Service Charges"), including, but not limited to the following: (1) recurring monthly or weekly access charges; (2) charges and taxes for optional Service features that you select, including long distance and directory assistance (411) calls and other optional features, such as ringtone downloads; (3) any Service reconnection charges that may apply, such as a reactivation fee; and (4) all applicable taxes and regulatory charges whether assessed directly on you or us; provided, however, that for certain tax inclusive Rate Plans, only applicable taxes and regulatory charges may be included in the Rate Plan price. You must pay all taxes, fees and surcharges set by federal, state and local governments. To determine taxes, fees and surcharges, we will use the street address you identified as your Place of Primary Use ("PPU"). If you did not identify the correct PPU, or provided an address that is not a recognized street address, such as a PO Box, does not identify the applicable taxing jurisdictions or does not reflect the Service area associated with your telephone number, you may be assigned a default PPU for tax purposes. You acknowledge and agree that a default PPU may affect your ability to receive E-911 assistance and you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any claims relating to your failure to provide a valid PPU. In addition, if you are not on a tax-inclusive plan, you agree to pay all regulatory administration charges ("Regulatory Administration Charges"), which may include, but are not limited to, Federal Universal Service, various regulatory charges, our administrative charges, gross receipts charges, margin taxes, and charges for the costs we incur in complying with governmental programs. Regulatory Administration Charges are not taxes and are not required by law. We set these charges, and the amounts and what they include may change without notice. They are rates we choose to collect from you and are kept by us in whole or in part. The number and type of Regulatory Administration Charges may vary depending upon the PPU of the wireless device and can change over time. We determine the rate for these charges and these amounts are subject to change as are the components used to calculate these amounts. Changes to taxes, fees and surcharges will become effective as provided by the taxing authority and changes to Regulatory Administration Charges shall be effective immediately. You are responsible for all Charges to your account, whether or not you were the user of the wireless device. If your wireless device gets lost or stolen, you agree to notify us immediately, so we can suspend your Service to prevent someone else from using it. After your Service is suspended, you will not be responsible for additional usage charges incurred in excess of your Rate Plan Charges, applicable taxes, fees, and Surcharges. If you request that we not suspend your Service, you will remain responsible for all usage, Charges incurred, and applicable taxes and fees. We may prevent a lost or stolen wireless device from registering on our and other networks. Wireless access to corporate/employee email may require additional server or server access, licenses, or additional requirements which may incur additional charges. By requesting wireless access to corporate/employee email, you agree to pay any of these additional charges.. Certain parties besides MetroPCS have the ability to place charges on your bill for their services. You may access these services and authorize the placement of charges on your bill through your phone or online account. MetroPCS also provides customers, at no additional cost, with the ability to restrict the placement of charges for third-party services on your account. Contact customer care at 1-888-8metro8 or go to. Service Charges must be paid in advance and are due before the first day of your service cycle. Service Charges cannot be paid in arrears. Unless otherwise specified in your Rate Plan, monthly service cycles are approximately 30 days long. The dates of your monthly or weekly service cycle and other dates related to your account may change from time to time. You must promptly notify us of any change in your billing address. As a convenience, you may authorize recurring payment of your Service Charges through a credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization; this authorizes us to charge all amounts you owe us to the credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization up to five (5) days prior to the due date and to demand immediate payment from the card or debit issuer or bank. Unless required by law, we will not give any additional notice to you or obtain additional consent from you before charging Service Charges to that credit or debit card. You must promptly notify us of any change in the credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization you want to use for payment. You may also make a payment by credit or debit card online at www.metropcs.com or through the automated MetroPCS IVR. In addition, you may pay your Service Charges by sending a check or money order by mail to P.O. Box 5119, Carol Stream, Illinois, 60197-5119, or by bringing cash, check, or money order in person to any MetroPCS store or authorized payment center. You may be required to pay an additional service charge, depending on the payment method you choose. This information is available at MetroPCS.com. In addition, we may charge an additional fee up to the maximum amount permitted by law for any check or other negotiable instrument tendered by you and returned unpaid by a financial institution for any reason. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to require that you pay your Service Charges with cash, certified check, cashier's check, or money order. We also reserve the right to report any check returned to us to reporting and credit agencies and law enforcement.. * Your right to Dispute Charges.. Your payment will be considered late if we do not receive it before the first day of the service cycle for which the payment is due. If you do not make all payments when they are due, you will be in default under this Agreement, and MetroPCS will be entitled to exercise any rights it may have under this Agreement, including the suspension or termination of Service to you. If we accept a late or partial payment, even if you mark the payment "paid in full," we do not waive our rights to suspend or terminate your Service or any other rights we may have. If your Service is terminated and you promptly pay amounts that are overdue, MetroPCS, in its sole discretion, may reconnect your Service after you have paid any reconnection fees we have imposed. In such case, your service cycle anniversary date will not change, which will result in fewer days of service for that month. If you have a dispute regarding the Charges to your account, or about the Services provided to you, you agree to notify us of the dispute within 60 days after the date you first receive the disputed Charge ("Dispute Period"), unless otherwise provided by law. If you do not notify us of your dispute in writing within the Dispute Period, you have waived such claim and will be forever barred and estopped from raising, or making a claim for such dispute and you may not pursue a claim in arbitration or in court. Unless otherwise provided by law, you must pay disputed Charges until the dispute is resolved. If you accept a credit, refund or other compensation or benefit to resolve a disputed Charge, you agree that the issue is fully and finally resolved and such credit shall act as an accord and satisfaction. In the event of a lost or stolen wireless device, for Charges incurred before you notify us, you are not liable for charges you did not authorize, but the fact that your wireless device or service was used is some evidence of authorization. You may request that we investigate Charges you believe were unauthorized. We may ask you to provide information and you may submit information to support your request. If we determine the charges were unauthorized, we will credit your account. If we determine the charges were authorized, we will inform you within 30 days and you will remain responsible for the charges.. You expressly consent to be contacted, by MetroPCS or anyone calling on its behalf, for any and all purposes, at any telephone number, or physical or electronic address where you may be reached, including any wireless telephone number. You agree that MetroPCS may contact you in any way, including, pre-recorded or artificial voice or text messages delivered by an automatic telephone dialing system, or e-mail messages delivered by an automatic e-mailing system. You agree that we also have the consent to contact any Authorized User on your account for Service or payment related reasons. Any such notice will be treated as provided to you when left with you, on your wireless device, on your answering/voicemail service, or by email or fax to any email or fax number you provided to us, or 3-days after mailing to your last known address as shown in our records. Your consent to be contacted may be revoked only if it is in writing and is with MetroPCS’s express agreement. You must notify us of any address changes.

AS330 Titan Reviews - page 2. Rated 5 out of. a phone i can totally control. i love this phone because anytime any funny business starts up its sure to let me know. I love the fact i can shut off any app i choose anytime and do a reset in a flash. love love love this phone because its simply to the point.. Rated 1 out of. Cant really use my sd card. I wish I would have bought a different brand of phone I added an SD card that I almost cannot use. The space internal drive on this phone is constantly running low. I'm unable to move most of the applications to the SD card. Rated 4 out of. Great aside from annoying headphone glitch. Everything about the phone is great. The memory is a little small though. The one thing that is absolutely annoying and completely unfixable is that when you plug head phones in the phone will flip out and pull up google voice search repeatedly (even with headphones with no mic) so if you planned on listening to music, too bad.. Rated 1 out of. Bought because I thought it would be as good as the LG l90. Really the only thing I don't like about it...is it's antenna not good enough. What good is a phone if antenna is weak. When I shop for another phone. ..a strong antenna is my main priority.. Rated 1 out of. Purchased the phone to take to Asia for travel, phone unable to connect to 3g/4g internet when the lable on the phone says 4g LTE. Rated 4 out of. Over all it is a good "basic" phone. The camera features are not that great, very disappointed. There's not light to tell you you had a text or missed a call. There isn't any notification to let you know you battery is going out while your talking so it just hangs up on you.. But, over all, it is a good very basic phone if you want one with no bells and whistles.. Rated 5 out of. We have two of these phones that we use with Pure TalkUSA, which uses the ATT network. These phones were easy to set up and are not loaded with ATT bloat. I recommend both this phone and Pure TalkUSA.. Rated 5 out of. Finally a phone i love! I'd have to say I've had absolutely no problems with this phone.. LG Portable & Bluetooth® Wireless Rolly Keyboard™ 2. LG Power Tank - 10,000 mAh Portable Battery Charger & Power Pack.

First look: LG's new K7 and K10 phones. LG's latest budget-centric phones adopt a new design language, with familiar software and basic Android specs.. The successor to LG's L series phones has made its public debut at CES 2016. The LG K7 and K10 introduce a new, softer design language along with a familiar LG software experience and a couple of features from the company's higher-end products.. At first glance, the entry-level K7 and the slightly speccier K10 don't look a whole lot like the company's other handsets. The new "glossy pebble" design language is more reminiscent of some of Samsung's older handsets, with a reflective (and highly fingerprinty) plastic rear on the K10, and a patterned matte finish on the K7.. That's broken up by LG's trademark rear buttons, a feature which the company claims helps it maintain its soft, rounded profile. Around the front you'll find "2.5D" rounded glass, which blends into the outer bezel. From the front they're attractive enough designs, although the backs of both phones betray their budget origins.. Internally, you'll find a wide range of processors powering these phones, depending on which model you pick up, and whether you opt for LTE or 3G connectivity. You're looking at between 1.1 and 1.3 quad-core Snapdragon processors unless you buy for the highest-end LTE-enabled K10.. Other differences include screen size — the K7 rocks a 5-inch FWVGA (854x480) display like it's 2010, while the K10 upgrades to a more reasonable 5.3-inch 720p panel. Both screens look decent enough in terms of brightness and color vibrancy, but it's clear there's not much pixel density to go around.. When it comes to software, both pack Android 5.1 Lollipop along with LG's UI 4.0 interface layer. That means you get a lot of the apps, widgets and design elements from phones like the G4. Both the K7 and K10 perform pretty well, with no noticeable lag present during our fleeting time with the handsets. And some of LG's more premium software features have made it across to the K series, including gesture shot — the ability to take a selfie with an open-fist gesture.. Beyond software features, LG continues to gradually upgrade the camera hardware of its entry-level offerings. The K7 packs an 8-megapixel rear shooter and 5-megapixel front-facer, while the K10 upgrades to 13 megapixels on the back, and 8 around the front, paired with an LED flash. Neither is going to take spectacular photos in low light, but pictures from the K10 seemed at least passable under convention center lighting in Las Vegas.. availability for the K10, which was shown with Korean software at CES. However its smaller sibling will be heading to Boost Mobile sometime in the first quarter of 2016.. MORE: LG K-series announcement and specs. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.
