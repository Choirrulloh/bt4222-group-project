Hands on: BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9982 review. Gallery: Porsche Design P'9982 vs BlackBerry Z10. Have you ever thought, "Man! I wish the BlackBerry Z10 cost a whole lot more money!"? If you have, then this is the phone for you: the RRP is a massive £1,450 ($2,350 or AU$2,500). It's a phone many are finding difficult to justify for BlackBerry in its current unstable condition. But the Canadian firm isn't listening to the naysayers - it's just ploughing on.. That determination has led to the arrival of the rather clumsily named BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9982 - a smartphone for the wealthy business person who wants something to gloat about at the next board meeting.. This isn't a phone for the mainstream, and with a recommended retail price of £1450/$2350 (around AU$2500) it's something which only the very elite will potentially consider.. We say potentially, because for all that money you're not actually getting a great deal. Think the P'9982 looks familiar? Well that's because it's just a run of the mill BlackBerry Z10 with a fancy stainless steel and Italian leather suit.. In terms of design the Porsche Design P'9982 is more angular than the phone it's based on, with a more pronounced chin below the screen - although it is crafted from stainless steel rather than plastic.. That stainless steel frame runs up either side of the P'9982 and connects to a chunk of stainless steel at the top of the handset.. It's a design we weren't overly keen about on the Z10 or Z30 as it appears to add unnecessary bulk to the device without offering anything above a place to splash the Porsche Design logo.. On each side of the P'9982, towards the bottom, is a small square where the Porsche Design logo resides - a subtle reminder that this isn't your ordinary BlackBerry Z10.. We found the P'9982 sat nicely in the hand with a well balanced 140g weight which was enough to make the phone feel premium without being overbearing.. That said, it doesn't feel as premium as the price tag suggests and we'd argue that the HTC One and iPhone 5S feel the same, or perhaps even better than the P'9982 in the hand.. The stainless steel frame means it's a solid handset, and the Italian leather rear provides a decent level or grip while also feeling rather lovely. It does appear to be something that could get damaged relatively easily though.. If your leather back does get ruined you can always remove it and replace it with another - although there's obviously an additional cost there.. Under the rear cover is a removable battery - the same 1800mAh power pack found in the Z10, although this time it's got Porsche Design written on it. BlackBerry claims it's good for 9 hours, but we were unable to test this during our hands-on time.. There's also access to the microSD slot which can take cards up to 64GB in size, and the microSIM port which annoyingly can only be reached if you take the battery out.. That will prove a pain for anyone who switches SIMs on a regular basis - like the international businessmen (and women) who this handset is targeted at.. At 131 x 65.6 x 9.5mm the P'9982 is ever so slightly longer and thicker than the Z10, but the width remains the same - as does the 4.2-inch, 1280 x 768 display.. In fact the P'9982 sports exactly the same specs as the Z10 apart from one thing - the internal storage has been boosted from 16GB to 64GB.. The screen is clean and clear with some decent viewing angles, although when you think that we now have full HD display on our smartphones (which cost less than half the price) you end up feeling a little short changed by the P'9982.. That feeling grows when you discover that the Porsche Design P'9982 still holds onto the humble 1.5GHz dual-core processor from the Z10 - there's no quad-core chip on offer here.. During general usage the dual-core chip manages pretty well with the relatively fluid BlackBerry 10.2 operating system, but it noticeably struggled when we started to ask a little more of the P'9982.. We're still not totally sold on the BlackBerry 10 platform, with its slightly confusing gesture controls making some tasks a little fiddly and the poor selection of apps in the BlackBerry World store doesn't help.. It's not all bad news though, and the BlackBerry Hub is a truly useful part of the interface, bringing in all forms of communication into one central inbox which can easily be navigated and filtered.. Web browsing is something else BlackBerry appears to have nailed with its new OS and the P'9982 is no exception with blisteringly fast load times on both mobile and desktop sites.. There's 2GB of RAM backing up the dual-core chip in the P'9982 which will no doubt help the surfing speeds and the inclusion of Flash supports is something BlackBerry has over iOS, Android and Windows Phone devices.. Return to the rear of the handset and there's the 8MP camera which also adorns the Z10, but on the P'9982 there's a chrome ring round the lens to try and add a more premium feel and it sits in a bar of glass which also houses the single LED flash and the name of the handset.. The camera app is basic, yet intuitive and the shutter speed is relatively quick with the whole screen acting as the trigger. Auto-focus is in play, and it can slow down snapping as it tries to settle.. BlackBerry has always been well known for its physical QWERTY keyboards and it made a big deal about its touchscreen offering on BlackBerry 10 which sits on the P'9982. It's a slick offering and we were able to get up to a decent typing speed, but we still prefer SwiftKey on Android.. Every Porsche Design P'9982 handset comes with a certificate of authentication in the box, so you can prove to your doubting friends that it is the real deal. The certificate also holds a unique BlackBerry pin starting in "2AA" - an exclusive prefix available only to those who have splashed the cash on a Porsche Design handset.. The BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9982 is targeted at a minority of elite business players, it's not meant to capture the imagination of general consumers - which is lucky, because it won't.. That said, for a phone which costs so much the P'9982's look and feel doesn't come close to justifying the price tag. You need a hell of a lot more than a bit of shiny metal and a layer of cowhide to push a sub-standard flagship smartphone as high-flying premium offering.. While the Porsche Design P'9982 isn't quite a grotesque in price, look or spec as the luxury Vertu brand, it's still set up to target those with more money than sense.. Next Page Hands on gallery.

What's good Made with premium materials like stainless steel and leather Fast web browsing experience Flash support. What's bad Specs and performance don't match price tag Confusing gesture control Not true HD display. The BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9882 is, as the name suggests, a product birthed after collaboration between BlackBerry and Porsche Design. Like the Porsche car, the BlackBerry Porsche phone has a fairly prohibitive price tag, making it more suitable for the elite crowd than the mainstream.. Despite the price tag, many reviewers were unimpressed with the design and point out that it looks almost exactly the same as the BlackBerry Z10. Instead of a plastic body though, the phone sports a stainless steel frame and leather removable back cover. Critics were happy with the overall feel of the phone, noting that the leather back provides a good grip. Aside from adding sophistication, these materials also add a little heft. TechRadar mentions that while the weight does make the phone feel premium they go on to say that, "it doesn't feel as premium as the price tag suggests…". On the front is a 4.2-inch display with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. Most experts agree that the display offered crisp details, good viewing angles and color reproduction though they found the gesture control very confusing. On the rear of the phone is an 8 megapixel camera. For the most part critics were able to take decent quality pictures due to its autofocus capabilities, LED flash and image stabilization.. Performance-wise the phone offered reviewers a speedy interface and little lag when opening apps thanks to its 1.5GHz dual-core processor and 2GB of RAM. Critics did begin to notice some stuttering when they had multiple apps open and when viewing graphically rich websites. Web browsing in general was fast for most experts on both the 4G and Wi-Fi network. One bonus for many experts was BlackBerry's inclusion of Flash support which neither Android nor iOS offers. The phone also comes with 64GB of internal storage, and expandable microSD slot and a removable 1800mAH battery.. The P'9882 seemed to be a hard phone to recommend due to its high costs and fairly average specs. Still, Phonedog mentions, "…many folks that are seriously considering opening their wallets for one of these things don't really obsess over spec lists.". BlackBerry released the Porsche Design P'9982 on November 26, 2013.. Where can I download the Porsche Design P'9982 manual?. We've got you covered! Download a free PDF copy of the BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9982 user manual here .. How long is the warranty period?. BlackBerry backs up the Porsche Design P'9982 with a 1 Year parts & labour warranty.. I have Porsche Design P'9982 problems. Where can should I go for support, replacement or repairs?. If your Porsche Design P'9982 has problems and is still within its warranty period, you could contact BlackBerry support or the retailer you purchased the phone from. You'll find BlackBerry's contact information here.

The BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9982 has been officially unveiled, with the luxury BB10 handset marking the second collaboration between the two companies.. Following closely in the footsteps of the BlackBerry P’9981, the newly confirmed BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9982 sees a premium brushed metal finish and refined user interface given to what is essentially the BlackBerry Z10 in disguise.. “The new all-touch P’9982 smartphone combines a unique design from an iconic brand with the power of BlackBerry 10,” Alistair Hamilton, BlackBerry’s Senior Vice President of Design said. “ Every aspect of this smartphone has been purposely designed and built for a powerful premium experience .”. Juergen Gessler, CEO of the Porsche Design Group added: “Once again the collaboration with BlackBerry has led to a device that implements our Iconic Style credo without compromises. With the P’9982 we extend our range of modern luxury smartphones and establish ourselves as a market leader in this segment.”. BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9982 Features Aside from the new, luxuriously finished design, the BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9982 features list is remarkably similar to that of the BlackBerry Z10, a handset launched back in January.. With a 4.2-inch display playing host to a 1280 x 768 pixel resolution and 356 pixels-per-inch image density, the BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9982 specs sheet sees a 1.5GHz dual-core processor and 2GB of RAM added to the mix.. Although the 64GB of internal storage is significantly higher than the Z10’s 16GB internals, the P’9982’s 8-megapixel rear-mounted camera and secondary, 2-megapixel snapper up front have also been ripped from the BB10 launching handset.. Measuring in at 9.5mm thick and 140g in weight, the BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9982 features list is rounded off by a 1800mAh Lithium-Ion battery and the newly skinned BB10 operating system.. BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9982 Release Date and Price Set to hit retailers later this week, a BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9982 release date has been set for November 21. The phone will be available through Carphone Warehouse, Selfridges, Harrods and the Porsche Design Store.. Despite only minor improvements over the Z10, the BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9982 price has been set at a frankly ridiculous £1,400 on a SIM-free basis.. Read More: BlackBerry Z30 review.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. This case turns your iPhone into a modular device. Samsung's updated DeX desktop experience uses the S9 as a trackpad. We're live from MWC 2018 in Barcelona!. You can’t buy an ethical smartphone today. BlackBerry's 'Jarvis' finds security flaws in connected cars. BlackBerry Mobile commits to "at least" two new phones in 2018. BlackBerry's Porsche-designed Z10 is a phone that even it can't afford. If your company produced a device that, while technically accomplished, managed to lose you $1 billion a few months later, you'd probably try and pretend that it never existed. That's not the approach that BlackBerry is taking with the Z10 , however. Instead, the beleaguered smartphone maker has teamed up with Porsche Design to create the P'9982 , a gussied-up version of the touchscreen smartphone designed to tempt golf course-bound executives and the super rich in ways that the original evidently failed to do. We've just got one of the devices in our hand, and we thought we'd run the rule over it to see how the other half live.. Gallery: BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9982 hands-on | 6 Photos. It's probably best, right out of the gate, to reiterate how this isn't your average piece of consumer technology. This is a device that'll launch exclusively at Britain's luxurious Harrods department store for £1,450 in the UK, $2,350 in the US and €1,650 in Europe. There's apparently a market for this sort of hardware, as the older P'9981 -- a revamped Bold 9900 -- was Harrods' biggest selling consumer technology product ever. Still, as far as the technology goes, this is just a Z10, but with 64GB of internal storage instead of 16GB and a microSD card slot that's now verified for 64GB cards. That's it for changes, which means you're still getting a 4.2-inch 1,280 x 768 display, a 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm MSM8960 and 2GB RAM. Unfortunately, while this device will launch globally, there's no word of a CDMA-compatible variant, so Verizon and Sprint customers will be disappointed. Open up the presentation box and you'll find a credit card-sized certificate of authenticity and an exclusive BBM pin code. When you sign into the service with this code, your user profile will gain a small icon, telling the world that you've spent big to get this piece of hardware. Of course, this isn't just BlackBerry's baby, as Porsche Design, broadly speaking, takes the device out of the company's hands before adding its own spin onto the hardware. For what it's worth, the smartphone maker is keen to stress that this is a side-project, existing outside of the Z10 / Z30 / Q10 / Q5 product matrix, although the P'9982 will be eligible for any and all future OS upgrades.. In fact, we get the sense that development of the P'9982 commenced before the launch of the Z10. In those halcyon days, Thorsten Heins was still convinced that the company's Blackberry 10 devices and software would be enough to restore the company's dwindling fortunes back to its heyday. Unfortunately, the corporate drama that surrounds the business has overtaken the best-laid plans of its designers, and when we tried to ask about BlackBerry's future corporate strategy, the answers were non-answers. With the P'9982, we're left with something that is, perhaps, a relic, perhaps a museum piece, but it's a beautiful one at that.. blackberry , hands-on , mobilepostcross , P9982 , Porsche Design.

This five star item with 64 GO. Storage is a real good value for money. You have to get one to experience it's smashing performance.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars A Piece of Jewelry, Does Not Support Popular Apps. Nice phone unfortunately does not accommodate various apps such as Viber and some others and disappointed by the fact the Whatsapp application by the end the year no longer will be handled by the phone. How could this be accepted on a newer phone not have the capability to run the most important apps in market. But if you install Playstore on this model you can definitely install all android apps, that means you can use BlackBerry OS and android all in one cellphone! and the BlackBerry OS is more stable and safe than android. For those of you who want to know why this is so expensive, I tell you why. You pay almost 80,000 and stay in line for couple days just to get an iPhone which another 10 million people will buy then you should not complain about this phone. This is like you buy a limited edition car which they make a couple thousand of not millions. This is a symbol of wealth just like a Vertu phone if you have ever seen one. The camera is great A-Z is great and so is the battery; which is the most important thing! Perfect machines if you would like to enjoy the Porsche class, It's unique and a piece of art..

I had been receiving massages form BB that it will stop supporting Whatsup come December 31 2016. After that BB extended the time of support to july 2017. Even since from last November, my device haven't got any security updates! I doubt if major apps like Facebook, amazon would work anymore!
