CNET también está disponible en español.. The Good The RIM BlackBerry Curve 3G has a slim profile, a responsive optical trackpad, and external media keys. It also has Wi-Fi, stereo Bluetooth, GPS, 3G, and a 2-megapixel camera.. The Bad The RIM BlackBerry Curve 3G is almost identical to its predecessor save for a few changes. The photo quality is poor as well.. The Bottom Line Though we're disappointed that the RIM BlackBerry Curve 3G didn't have more improvements over its predecessor, it's still a decent upgrade with the addition of 3G and GPS. Plus, it's quite affordable for an entry-level smartphone.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Photo gallery: RIM BlackBerry Curve 3G. Even though we liked the RIM BlackBerry Curve 8520 that was released for T-Mobile last year, the lack of 3G and GPS was disappointing. Fortunately, RIM has rectified that with its successor, the RIM BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300, which has support for T-Mobile's 3G network as well as GPS. It also offers a number of other improvements that we saw in the Curve 8530 , like the 624MHz processor and 256MB internal memory. Admittedly, we're a tad disappointed that the rest of the handset is unchanged; the hardware is almost identical and the features remain largely the same. Still, the Curve 3G does make for a great entry-level smartphone, especially as it is only $79.99 with a new two-year service agreement.. A lot of the BlackBerry Curve 3G's design strikes us as de ja vu; it looks and feels very similar to its predecessor, the Curve 8520. Its measurements are about the same--4.3 inches long by 2.4 inches wide by 0.6 inch thick--and it weighs around 3.6 ounces as well. It has the same 2.4-inch display, the same media keys at the top, and, of course, the same QWERTY keyboard.. The RIM BlackBerry Curve 3G has an optical trackpad and a rather flat navigation array.. One of the minor design differences the Curve 3G has over its predecessor is that the optical trackpad is a touch more raised and rounded, which is a design tweak we like. We found it really responsive as well. Another change is that the 8520 had barriers separating the navigation keys, whereas the Curve 3G's navigation array is completely flat without any sort of division. We preferred the former, as it was a little easier to navigate by feel, but we weren't too turned off by the new design, either. Yet another minor change is that the back of the Curve 3G has is a texturized rubber, so it doesn't slide around when placed on a smooth surface, plus it offers a better grip when held.. Aside from that, the rest of the phone's controls and buttons are identical to its predecessor, so we'll point you to the review of the BlackBerry Curve 8520 for a more detailed design overview.. The BlackBerry Curve 3G comes with an AC adapter plug, a USB cable, a wired headset, a mini CD, and reference material.. The RIM BlackBerry Curve 3G comes with BlackBerry OS 5, but RIM has said that it can be upgraded to BlackBerry OS 6 , which we think will be quite an improvement. OS 6 will add a revamped home screen, universal search, easier access to messaging features, a new Web browser, and more.. It has the usual phone features like speakerphone, voice dialing, conference calling, speed dialing, and text and multimedia messaging. It also has a variety of instant messaging options like BlackBerry Messenger, AIM, ICQ, Yahoo, Windows Live, and so forth.. The Curve 3G continues the BlackBerry legacy of strong e-mail options with the ability to sync with your company's BlackBerry Enterprise server in addition to other corporate e-mail systems like Microsoft Exchange, IBM Lotus Domino, and more. You can also add your own POP3 or IMAP4 e-mail information, and it's smart enough to figure out settings from popular e-mail services like Gmail and Yahoo Mail.. The address book is limited to available memory and the SIM card can hold about 250 more contacts. Each entry has room for several numbers, e-mail addresses, and street addresses. You can assign a caller group, a photo for caller ID, and custom ringtones. Other tools include the calendar, a task list, a memo pad, a voice recorder, and a calculator.. Best Phones for 2018.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 2.0 out of 5 stars Get a different phone.... Works as a blackberry, but I would recommend getting an Android from Walmart more. This can't load med sized pages, and Ruins on blackberry os6. You will always get this error "Sorry, were closing this page because it's too large to load!". You also can't download any apps unless you have a data plan, which is dumb. You have to use the tracking pad and a cursor all the time. YouTube videos always do not match up with the audio also, and when a page loads a lot, the phone freezes, them restarts, which gets on my nerves. I bought a ZTE majesty pro for cheaper and it work so much better. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Two Stars. its a locked gsm, can't use it with my local provider. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars I would give this a 0 star if I was .... I would give this a 0 star if I was given the option! Do NOT buy this product. I purchased in Jan, had it just 3 months before the scroll option stopped working. That meant I couldn't view anything, just able to make a call out. Unable to return, now stuck purchasing another new phone! Very, very upsetting. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars The battery was died soon after purchase. The battery was died soon after purchase. They shipped a new battery but because I needed it for a trip, this was not very helpful. Over the course a month, the trackpad became almost impossible to use. (This may have been due to high humidity, but I keep the phone in silica at night.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars BB curve 3G - Phone Not complete-Wrong Band statement (for Venezuela). I have had this phone for about a month now. The product description says 850/900/1800/1900MHz frequencies and 3G HSDPA 850/900/1700/1900/2100 plus GPRS/EDGE, meaning, in venezuela, should support Movistar/Movilnet and even Digitel Bands. However, this is not true, this phone only supports 1,4,8 3G bands (2100,1700,900). This needs to be better specified on the product description. Also there are some missing items: No headsets, No SD memory Phone overall is ok, but I had to change to DIGITEL to be able to use the 3G network, also had to buy to buy the missing accessories.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars I’ve had Blackberry phones before and loved using them. I’ve had Blackberry phones before and loved using them. The description sad it was used, but it looks pretty pristine to me. I would be happy to purchase from this seller in the future.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars The phone you buy might not be real.. First and foremost, people please be aware of what you are buying. I bought my first one and it was a counterfeit phone from China, so was the second. Both of them were described as brand new. This is how you recognize a fake phone. I hope it'll help in somehow. All of the labels out side of the box are miss-printed, words and numbers are not clear. The REAL ONE comes with a very clear and well-printed. For those of you that had used BB before, you can tell the fake phone fell very cheap and light. The REAL ONE will felt very solid in hand as well as it is pretty heavy. In side the fake phone, labels in side the back(behind the battery) are also miss-printed some words, and also not clear. In the REAL one, all of the words are well-printed and that the MUST. Turn on the phone and try move the little touch pad in the middle of the phone. If you have a fake phone, it is very hard to move the cursor up and down, (sometimes left and right but mostly up and down). In the REAL ONE, you can easily move it any where you want and it almost no delay at all. Lastly, sorry for my bad English if I make any mistake. I had seen so many people blamed BB for bad products but the real problem is we are not using the real BB, we are using some bull @#% from China. I rate this phone 4 stars because I had used it before and still using it. I want to buy an extra one for my mom but it seem we have too much problems of buying real products from Amazon nowadays. Feel free to ask me if you have any concern.. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars OK. Decent phone, just needed something to cover me while my new phone came in. Everything is in Spanish, it'll take you a bit to even find the language settings (I'd list it all out but can't find it again). Was this review helpful to you?. phone wad received and did not work at all.

Press enter or click on the search icon. Page 1 BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300. The Curve 3G 9300 is basically an updated version of the Curve 8520 – RIM’s previous entry-level model. But rather than merely rehashing that phone, RIM has added in some tempting extras, not least of which is support for 3G, something that the 8520 was sorely missing. Nevertheless, the phone is primarily aimed at first time BlackBerry users, or at least those who don’t want to be overwhelmed with features, so it lacks many of the bells and whistles found on the company’s higher end models. The questions is, then, does the Curve 3G still have enough thrills to tempt those buyers?. As you would perhaps expect, the phone sticks closely to the BlackBerry design blueprint. It has the standard layout with a landscape screen at the top and a full QWERTY keyboard nestled below. The Curve 3G is quite small measuring 109 x 60 x 14mm so it fits comfortably in your hand and the rubberised coating used on the side-mounted buttons and battery cover help with gripping the phone.. As with most of the latest BlackBerry models this one sports a line of three media playback buttons across the top. These are used to skip forwards or backwards through your tunes and to play and pause music. They’re quite a handy addition to have, but their presence on the top of the phone does mean that RIM has had to shift the standard 3.5mm headphone jack to the left-hand edge of the handset, which isn’t ideal as with headphones inserted it tends to snag as you take it in and out of your pocket.. Beneath this jack, you’ll find the micro-USB port which is used both for synching the phone with a PC or laptop and charging it. Other controls include a voice-dialling button on the left-hand side as well as volume controls and a dedicated camera button on the right.. The phone’s 2-megapixel camera is very basic, however. Unlike the snapper found on the higher end Bold 9700 , this one doesn’t have a flash and also lacks autofocus. Outdoor shots don’t look too bad, although they lack a bit of sharpness and detail, but snaps taken indoors look very dark and noisy.. In common with most of BlackBerry’s range, the Curve 3G doesn’t have a touchscreen. Instead, you navigate around its menus using the optical joystick that sits in the centre of the phone between the display and keyboard. The joystick tracks movements of your finger pretty well, but it’s still much slower and less intuitive to use than a touchscreen.. Next Screen, User Interface and Performance.

Not a huge advance on the previous model. RIM is pitching its BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300 at newcomers to the smartphone sector — at least, that's the implication from the press release announcing the product. Although the Curve 3G handles mobile email well — as you'd expect from BlackBerry — and adds 3G connectivity to the range, does it go far enough?. RIM's BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300 adds 3G connectivity and GPS to the Curve range. The BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300 shares the distinctive look of its predecessor, including an upwardly curving mini-QWERTY keypad. It's this shaping that helps distinguish Curve handsets from their higher-end Bold cousins.. The Curve 3G measures 60mm wide by 109mm deep by 13.9mm thick and weighs 104g. These are the same dimensions as the year-old Curve 8520 with a couple of grams shaved off the weight.. The design of the two handsets is very similar. The Curve 3G's chassis has a slate silver plastic surround, replacing the black of the earlier handset. The four distinctively BlackBerry buttons (Call, End, Back and Menu) above the keyboard are again flush to the chassis, but lack vertical dividers. The Curve 3G also retains the distinctive optical trackpad that has, in recent BlackBerry devices, replaced the mini-trackball that was prone to malfunctioning.. As in the Curve 8520, there are three media playback buttons on the top edge of the chassis, the central one doubling up as a device mute button. This is great for music fans, but it's unfortunate that the 3.5mm headset jack remains on the upper left edge. This is far from ideal, as an attached headset requires another few centimetres of pocket width and the slot can get damaged by snagging. We'd prefer smaller control buttons smaller with the headset jack squeezed onto the top edge alongside them.. The rubberised sides of the Curve 8520 also make a reappearance here. They obviously help you grip the handset better, and the fact that the side buttons feel more like bumps than buttons isn't a problem in practice. There's a volume rocker and a user-configurable 'convenience key' on the right, and a second convenience key on the left.. The back of the chassis is also rubberised, with stippling on the battery cover further assisting with grip. This is an improvement on the shiny plastic of the 8520's backplate.. The BlackBerry Curve 3G's screen measures 2.4in. across the diagonal and has a resolution of 320 by 240 pixels. This is the same as the Curve 8520, but significantly lower than the older Curve 8900 whose 2.4in. screen — like that of the most recent Bold, the 9700 — packs in 360 by 480 pixels.. The mini-QWERTY keyboard is a crucial feature of any BlackBerry handset, but the Curve 3G's doesn't quite match RIM's normally exemplary standards. The action isn't quite as definite as we're used to, although the reassuring click as keys are depressed is as loud as ever and the individual shaping and separation of the keys makes them easy to find at speed. Overall, our typing speed was just a little slower than we'd normally expect to achieve on a BlackBerry. That said, the Curve 3G's keyboard is by no means poor, and anyone coming to a smartphone for the first time should find it perfectly good enough.. RIM recently announced version 6 of its operating system , and there were hopes that the BlackBerry Curve 3G would be the first handset to appear with OS 6 pre-installed. However, the BlackBerry Curve 3G runs OS 5.. It is 'OS 6-ready', though, and it should be possible to upgrade in due course. As to when that will be, RIM says, rather circumspectly, in its Curve 3G press release that "BlackBerry 6 is expected to be available for the BlackBerry Curve 3G, subject to carrier certifications, in the coming months".. As its name suggests, the Curve 3G is the first of the range to support 3G connectivity. That's unlikely to affect mobile email, but those who want to use the device for web surfing should see a performance improvement. The small screen size remains a drawback, though: you almost always have to zoom into a web page to read its contents, and text rendering isn't particularly smooth. Heavy web users might want to consider a higher-resolution screen such as that of the BlackBerry Bold 9700.. The Curve 3G also sports GPS and Wi-Fi — along with 3G, absolute 'must have' features for any smartphone. Wi-Fi support includes 802.11b, g and n.. There is 256MB of Flash memory and a microSD card slot, easily accessible under the backplate, lets you add more storage if required. The camera, never a RIM strong suit, shoots stills at 2 megapixels and lacks a flash. Video recording tops out at 360 by 240 pixels and is of similar mediocre quality.. RIM has been developing its app store to support a community outside the strictly business world for some time now. The Curve 3G comes with a Facebook client preinstalled, and the BlackBerry App World store offers Twitter clients and other more consumer focussed fare. However, the App World not a patch on either Apple's iPhone App Store or Google's Android Market for sheer breadth of software.. The all-important mobile email works as well as ever, and you can do some potentially useful things like pull in Facebook pictures and syncronise your Gmail contacts.. Call quality is very good, and the BlackBerry Curve 3G had no trouble maintaining GSM or 3G signals during the test period. We used a T-Mobile SIM and testing occurred in and around London. Your experience may vary if you are in a poor 3G coverage area, however.. Battery life is an area where the BlackBerry Curve 3G impresses. With light use — concentrating on mobile email — you should easily get more than a day between charges, and could stretch well into two days. However, make much use of GPS, Wi-Fi, 3G or music playback and you'll be in the usual smartphone territory of requiring a charge every day.. The BlackBerry Curve 3G does not advance the Curve product line very far. Considering that its predecessor, the Curve 8520, is now a year old, the fact that the only additions are 3G and GPS could either be seen as a testament to the superb design of the earlier product, or a certain complacency on RIM's part.. The screen resolution could have done with a boost, and we'd appreciate more internal memory — or failing that a bundled microSD card. The Curve 3G certainly brings the range up to date, but RIM might have been better advised to wait and release it with OS 6 preinstalled.. Kick off your day with ZDNet's daily email newsletter.

CNET también está disponible en español.. BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300 (AT&T) review:. The Good The RIM BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300 is slim and compact, with a responsive optical touch pad, convenient external media keys, Wi-Fi, stereo Bluetooth, GPS, 3G, and a 2-megapixel camera.. The Bad The RIM BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300 is not too different from its predecessors, and remains a fairly basic smartphone.. The Bottom Line The RIM BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300 is a decent entry-level BlackBerry with a couple of modern features like 3G and GPS, but we wish it was more affordable.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. RIM might be struggling against the big Android and iOS competition with higher-end handhelds, but there still remains a strong BlackBerry contingent who wants that familiar keyboard feel that the Curve 3G 9300 offers. The recent RIM BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300 for AT&T has all of the usual BlackBerry features like robust support for messaging and e-mail, as well as a few media niceties like external media keys, a 2-megapixel camera, a music player, and more. It's more on the entry-level side of the smartphone equation, but if you want an old-school BlackBerry with a modern edge, the Curve 3G 9300 fits the bill.. The Curve 3G 9300 looks and feels a lot like the BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300 for T-Mobile --the hardware is identical in fact--so we'll point you to that review for the full design lowdown. For this review, we'll concentrate on features and performance. The AT&T version of the Curve 3G 9300 is $99.99 after a two-year service agreement, which is a bit more expensive than the same model on other carriers.. The RIM BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300 ships with BlackBerry OS 5 but it is upgradeable to the latest BlackBerry OS 6. The new OS has a revamped home screen, a new Webkit browser, universal search, a new notifications bar, and more.. The Curve 3G 9300 has the usual BlackBerry features you've come to know and love. It has voice dialing, conference calling, speed dialing, a speakerphone, and a vibrate mode. As with most BlackBerry phones, it also has a healthy set of messaging features that include text and multimedia messaging, instant messaging with BlackBerry Messenger, AIM, ICQ, Yahoo, and Windows Live, and of course, e-mail. You can use your own personal POP3 or IMAP accounts, and it's also compatible with most corporate e-mail systems like BlackBerry Enterprise, Microsoft Exchange, and IBM Lotus Domino.. Other features include GPS with AT&T Navigator support, Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g), and stereo Bluetooth. The GPS in the phone is useful with other location-based apps like Where and AllSport GPS, and when adding geotag information to photos. Productivity tools include a calendar, a memo pad, a task list, a calculator, and document viewers for Microsoft Office, Corel WordPerfect, and PDF documents. There's also a file viewer and the built-in BlackBerry Web browser.. The AT&T version of the BlackBerry Curve 3G 9300 comes with a few built-in apps as well. They include AT&T's own Mobile Web browser, YPMobile, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace, AT&T Music (AT&T's music download service), AT&T Radio, MobiTV, Mobile Banking, MyCast Weather, Bloomberg, and City ID. There are also a few games like Tetris, Scrabble, Sudoku, Bejeweled, Texas Hold 'Em, Pac-Man, Brickbreaker, Word Mole, and Klondike. For more apps, you can either purchase them from AT&T's App Center, or the BlackBerry App World. If you're also an AT&T U-Verse subscriber, you can download the AT&T U-Verse app for the Curve 3G. The app will let you view your U-Verse schedule and you can set up your DVR recordings from the app as well.. While we don't normally think of a BlackBerry as a multimedia phone, the Curve 3G 9300 does have a music player with support for MP3, WMA, AAC, and MIDI file formats. The video player is compatible with MPEG4, WMV, H.263 and H.264 support. Like the other Curve 3G phones, it also has a 2-megapixel camera, with rather average photo quality.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

Soy Cubano , y me encanta la marca Blackberry tengo uno y realmente estoy conforme con sus prestaciones pero quisiera , que me comentaran porque se les cae el recubrimiento que tiene por los costados es decir los botones de subir y bajar el sonido y los demas, toda esa parte se ha degradado , yo busco un cover para protegerlos y me dicen que ese modelo no lo trae , como es posible que aca en cuba haya una sucursal de la marca , a mi me encantaria , como a otras personas que conosco tener un blackberry pero aca no hay que pudiera hacer, ???. Mi pregunta es, por que si todabia hay tantas personas que utilizan los teléfonos bb hay muchas operadoras que están eliminando las diferentes aplicaciones como whattsapp y otras alegando que la marca blackberry se encuentra obsoleta .. el telefono es bueno no me quejo pero lo malo esque ya no va a funcinar el whatsapp eso si q es pesima noticia. y en efecto el internet es super en ese telefono se lo pongon a cualquier android. Este telefono no sera un cohete pero en navegacion se lo apuesto a cualquier telefono y si le bajan vpn y opera navegai full de gratis ay se los dejo pues. He estado echando un ojo a varios móviles y he encontrado este a 33€ por internet, hace poco que se me ha roto mi anterior móvil y estoy buscando uno nuevo, por ese precio me parece que esta bien y me sirve pra tirar unos meses^^. a mi me gusto mucho,la verdad es util,sencillo y muy manejable ademas de poder descagar las aplicaciones necesarias y justas.. Luego de una reparación (se había quedado la pantalla blanca) ya no tengo el microfono en whatsapp, esta actualizado. <recibo pero no puedo enviar audio ¿me pueden ayudar? Gracias.
