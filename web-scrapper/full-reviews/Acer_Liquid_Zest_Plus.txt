Easily fitted, pretty comfortable, and secure. Zest Review This is one of easiest CPAP masks I have used - a little noisy but fits good with no leaks.fat cat 51,. Life Saver The Zest mask is lightweight, comfortable, and sturdy. I used this mask for almost 5 years, replacing the foam seals as needed, and replacing the headgear once. I broke one of the glider strap channels while cleaning the mask-totally my fault-and didn't think twice about replacing it with exactly the same model. Zest Mask Zest continues to be the most comfortable mask for me. Best mask I have Ever Bought I am a second time buyer of this mask. I have used a CPAP since 1999 with various masks. This one is the King of Comfort John,. Great replacement Mask Bought this as a replacement mask for my wife. Cost me less than the doctors appointment would have. as expected from F/P as expected from F/Pgj,. Zest Premium Nasal CPAP After Eleven years using nasal CPAP, this is the best one yet! Calvin J,. prefect replacement needed to replace my old mask, this one works well and the price was right. easy to adjust and no more sidewall leaking. Junk I've had 3 of these masks in total and I'm done with them. The first one held up ok but then the plastic frame on the seal started cracking. I bought 3 replacement seals in total, all of which cracked within 2-6 weeks becoming unusable. Thinking that it was time to replace the whole mask, I bought a new one. That one was defective right out of the box. To DHM's credit, they replaced that one with no problem. Unfortunately, the new one has the same problem as my old one, the frame around the seal cracks, this one lasting about 1 week before showing the first signs of cracking. I now have to tape it up every night to got it to more or less work. Oddly enough, the original seal that came with my original mask held up well, lasting about 6 mo. None of the replacements or the one that came with the current mask even came close to that.. Even if the seals were not a problem, the fit is. Maintaining a seal while wearing this thing was always a problem. Trying to keep this thing working right is a constant battle. I might start out the night with it working right but that very rarely lasts. I may be stuck with this CPAP thing, but I definitely will not be buying any more of these masks. NOISY AND RATTLES THIS MASK HAS THE EXHAUST HOLES IN THE MASK HOUSING AND THIS CAUSES AN AIR LEAK SOUND THAT YOU CANT STOP R ANDERSON,. Well Made I've been using a Fisher & Paykel Zest Nasal CPAP mask for several year, but unfortunately recently broke the one I'd been using when I accidentally plopped down on my bed where it was under the blanket. The Zest is extremely comfortable, it allows little if any air out around the seal, and doesn't need to be cinched down tight to stay on. I very much recommend this mask. Zest is Best I avoided going on CPAP because I could never find a mask I liked. Nasal pillows are out - really weird feeling. I don't like masks where the tube goes over the top of your head. It is the best of them because the hose moves as you do, and you can sleep on your side, back, or stomach without the mask moving or falling off. The mask will last about a year before it starts to break. I only wish it were a little sturdier at the point where the hose hooks into the mask - the point that swivels freely as you move. This could be made stronger as this is the point that breaks eventually. Don't let that keep you from trying this mask - it is terrific! Garyloveslucy,. Zest CPAP Mask Quick delivery, good price, no problems with the equipment. Would order from Direct Home Medical and would recommend to others. Zest I will be ordering from them again HP,. Zest Premium Nasal CPAP Mask Pack with Headgear Other than the fact I find these CPAP Masks, of ANY BRAND, horribly expensive, this one works "OK." One problem I don't like at all is there are 3 small holes at the inlet port of the mask that allows air to constantly stream outward from the tube whether inhaling or exhaling. Loud enough it actually bothered my dog! It simply makes too much noise. I also feel I'm losing the proper CFM of airflow I should be receiving from my CPAP machine itself because of the constant airflow away from the hose itself. Also, the "Gel" around the entire mask itself is "over size," a bit, allowing the mask to flex a bit on inhale & exhale. It's large enough it actually comes down over my top lip quite a bit causing a bit of discomfort. I've 'kinda' gotten used to it but at this juncture I wouldn't recommend this particular mask to my friends or family who are also using CPAP Therapy and seriously, there are quite a few. I purchased two masks & headgear because I need one here in my home and bedroom. The second one is used in my motor home where I have a second CPAP Machine there. They both will work but whoever designed this particular mask fell short a couple pegs as far as I'm concerned. I would love to be able to exchange it for something of the same value that works more efficiently and moreso, more comfortably too! kj Ken J,. Good mask Got just what I ordered and promptly. Best C-Pap mask I have owned After 5 different types of masks I finally found one I can live with. Lite weight and easy to take on and off. Fits great on my face, very seldom leaks air into my eyes and I don't have to wear it tight around my head either to prevent air leakage. I can even sleep on my belly with it with my head to the side. I have a full round face. Nasal pillows made me sick even when cleaning them daily. Full face masks didn't give me enough air. Other masks, even the $150 highly recommended ones leaked air into my eyes. Sometimes the simplest designs and lower priced masks are the best. Whenever buying masks get the insurance. You just have to try them out. big improvement The mask arrived promptly in good shape. I didn't realized how badly the soft part of the old mask had deteriorated. The new one is a big improvement, leaks less and is quiter. right size The new mask is very comfortable because it fits so well. I had just gotten a new mask that was supposed to be for women and was a small. The top of it touched my tear ducts and the bottom sat on my upper lip. The zest mask is just perfect. I gave it 4 stars because I think the straps could be improved. Since it doesn't have a strap that fits over the top of the head, it tends to slid down. I put the straps from my previous mask on the Zest and now it's perfect. It has a strap going over the top of the head. Thanks for making a mask the right size. I was about ready to give up on the whole thing. Satisfied I went to replace this mask from my doctor. The difference in their price vs. The doctor's office seemed to think that since it was charged to my insurance provider it was not a big deal. However, those of us in small business' with pricey HSA policies need this kind of service. In a nut shell - very satisfied. Oh, and I do like the mask quite a bit which is why I was replacing it after a good bit of use of the original. Direct Medical Home I went to purchase the same medical supplies from my "Health Care" provider and their costs were astronomical. They are "covered" by my insurance, but I would still pay an arm and a leg. Even at your prices you are much, much less expensive. When I saw how much less expensive you were, I just purchased. Thanks for giving us an alternativeBob H.,. Zest CPAP Mask Thank you so much for sending this. It is much better than the sleapweaver. It fits snug to my face and there is no air blasts blowing in my face if I move the wrong way. I am very happy with it. Zest CPAP Fits better than the one I had.

This phone was great for about 4 months then it started going down hill. freezing , deleting apps, constant messages popping up about some app is unresponsive. It erased the keyboard one day and the only way i could get it back was to yell at my phon.... Man, just dropped his phone from the height of my head and it survived!!! No cracks or anything wow... I was expecting a tiny crack but NOTHING!!! For a $200 phone with no gorilla glass or anything that's great!.

Acer Liquid Zest Plus Smartphone Review. Marcus Herbrich ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 09/19/2016. The Taiwanese manufacturer, Acer, touts its Liquid Zest Plus as an accessory for travels: A long battery life, and high-quality audio and camera quality are to make the mid-range handset the ideal travel companion.

For the original German review, see here .. The Liquid Zest Plus' highlight is its 5000 mAh battery that is to power the mid-range smartphone for up to 3 days according to Acer. Furthermore, DTS-HD Premium Sound that generates virtual surround sound, and an improved headset sound quality is supported. The primary camera has a resolution of 13 megapixels and is furnished with "Tri-Focus" technology. The autofocus system uses laser, phase, and contrast detection for ideally setting the image focus.. Acer's Liquid Zest Plus has a 5.5-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels, and it is available in "Moroccan Blue" and "Andes White" for an RRP of just below 200 Euros (~$225). that also has a 5000 mAh battery belongs to Acer's handset direct competition.

The thin, 9.8-mm (~0.4 in) casing of the Liquid Zest Plus is largely made of plastic that is lightly matted on the back. The back cover that flexes marginally can be removed for expanding the storage via a micro-SD card or accessing the micro-SIM card slots when required. The 5000 mAh battery is, however, non-removable and cannot be replaced.. The Corning Gorilla Glass 3 display fits flush in the casing. At a height of 154 millimeters (~6 in) and a width of 77 millimeters (~3 in), the Liquid Zest Plus' display takes up 69.8% of the casing's front surface.. The plastic volume control and power button on the handset's right feature well-defined pressure points and are easy to reach. The quality of the polycarbonate casing cannot be criticized in view of the price range. The smartphone makes a solid and resistant impression.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. The internal eMMC storage in the Liquid Zest Plus has a capacity of 16 GB. Only 10.99 GB are left for the user in delivery state. If memory becomes low, it is possible to move installed applications to an external memory card via App2SD. Further configuration features include an FM radio, Wi-Fi Direct, a compass, and a status LED. A fingerprint scanner is not installed. The micro-USB 2.0 port also supports OTG (on-the-go) for connecting peripherals via an OTG adapter. Wireless transmission of display content to external monitors via Miracast is also supported, and it functioned very well in the test with a Sony Android TV.. Asus' ZenFone Max ZC550KL , the 5000 mAh battery acts as a kind of power bank for powering other devices via the micro-USB port.. Acer relies on the sixth Android iteration "Marshmallow" for its Liquid Zest Plus smartphone. The security patch from June 2016 was installed at test time. The user interface in the setting menu and the app drawer do not look very modified compared with Vanilla Android. Acer's proprietary interface, Acer UI, shows subtle, visual modifications in the app and folder design.. Like Acer's Liquid Z630S that we tested, it is possible to let applications, such as notes, calculator, calendar, and calls, float over an opened application. Furthermore, "Quick Touch" gestures can be entered on the screen when it is disabled. An optional read mode reduces blue light emission. Acer also installs a real offline navigation application based on TomTom maps that can be used without mobile Internet access called "AcerNav"..

The integrated Wi-Fi module in the Liquid Zest Plus only supports the IEEE 802.11 b/g/n standards, typical for this price range. The reception quality is good in everyday use, and the Wi-Fi signal is stable. The attenuation of almost -39 dBm was relatively low nearby the router (Telekom Speedport, W921V). The average data transmission rates to the router (Linksys EA8500) at a distance of one meter (~3 feet) of 50 Mbit/s (transmit) and 48 Mbit/s (receive) are on a common level for entry-level devices.. Bluetooth version 4.0 is onboard for wireless communication between mobile end devices. An NFC chip is not present. Acer's smartphone can access the mobile Internet at up to 150 MB/s (download) and 50 MB/s (upload) using LTE Cat.4. It supports quad-band GSM, quad-band UMTS, and the LTE frequencies 800, 1800, 2100, and 2600 MHz. The dual-SIM handset features two dedicated micro-SIM card slots and an additional micro-SD card slot - both SIM slots support accessing the LTE mobile network..

A sufficiently strong signal for an accuracy of approximately 4 meters (~13 ft) was generated in the indoor test. Based on our GPS test, a difference of roughly 70 meters (~230 ft) on the almost 8-kilometer (~5-mile) route is observed between the incorporated GPS module in the Liquid Zest Plus and Garmin's Edge 500 professional GPS reference device - a very good rate for an inexpensive mid-range smartphone..

Acer uses Google's stock phone app for its mid-range smartphone. It provides the usual features, such as favorites, call list, phone book, and search.. The earpiece's sound and voice quality are satisfactory. The contact is clearly understood thanks to the maximum volume - the same is true for the installed microphone. We performed test calls via Skype and the German Vodafone mobile (D) network.. The rear-facing camera module has a native resolution of 13 MP. The photos convince with high-contrast color reproduction in good light conditions. The achieved image sharpness of the autofocus is also satisfactory. Focusing on close objects for macro-photos functions well. The wide aperture of f/1.8 produces bright but also often overexposed photos (scene 1 & 3: graffiti and river). The dynamic range is a bit too low, and the photos consequently tend to look too dark in very different light conditions. The Liquid Zest Plus does a poor job in low-light scenarios (scene 3: street) - hardly any content is visible here.. A 5 MP camera with an f/2.0 aperture is installed on the front of Acer's smartphone. The quality is appealing and suitable for selfies and video telephony. Videos can be recorded in a maximum quality of 1080p at 30 FPS.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. Besides the smartphone, we found instructions, an in-ear headset, USB cable, and an 18-watt modular power supply (2A, 9V) in the review sample's box. A flip cover is available for Acer's Liquid Zest Plus for a recommended retail price of 25 Euros (~$28). In addition to protecting the smartphone, the cover offers useful functions, such as displaying the battery state or current weather, and even the option of taking pictures without having to open the case.. The capacitive touchscreen made a good impression in the test. Inputs were implemented accurately and without delay. The smartphone is used via Android-typical onscreen buttons. Google's stock Android keyboard is preloaded for text inputting ex-factory.. The 5.5-inch LCD panel furnished with the Zero Air Gap technology has a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. This results in a pixel density of approximately 267 PPI. The resolution provides a sufficient sharpness for everyday use.. The screen's average brightness of 420 cd/mÂ² is on par with our comparison devices, and its illumination of 94 percent is very homogeneous. We determined a similar rate of 418 cd/mÂ² in our measurement of equally distributed bright and dark areas (APL50). The screen achieves a rate of 397 cd/mÂ² when using the adaptive ambient light sensor for controlling the screen's brightness.. 412 cd/m² 414 cd/m² 420 cd/m² 411 cd/m² 414 cd/m² 431 cd/m² 424 cd/m² 414 cd/m² 437 cd/m². 94 % Center on Battery: 414. cd/m²) ΔE Color 8.1 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 9.6 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.

Acer's smartphone exhibits weaknesses in color accuracy and grayscale levels. The aberrations of 8.1 and 9.6 are somewhat high (target rate <3).

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. Acer's Liquid Zest Plus is powered by MediaTek's mid-range ARM SoC (system on a chip) from 2015. is built in 28 nanometers and has four CPU cores based on the 64-bit capable Cortex A53 architecture. In conjunction with 2 GB of RAM, our review sample is on par with the opponents in most benchmarks although it sports a somewhat weaker CPU. However, it cannot compete with the performance of MediaTek's. A similar impression exists in the browser tests as in the benchmark programs.. The performance of the internal 16 GB storage is not particularly fast in sequential read and write, and it lags slightly behind the rivals in the comparison. On the other hand, the access rates in small 4 KB data blocks are in line with the competition. The integrated micro-SD card slot is not the fastest, either. We tested the speed with our Toshiba Exceria Pro M401 reference memory card (max. read: 95 MB/s; write: 80 MB/s). The slot's performance of 28 MB/s (read) and 16 MB/s (write) is rather below average even for an affordable mid-range handset..

The rear-sided mono speaker achieves a maximum volume of 85 dB(A). Its sound quality is on a good level for the price range, and it hardly sounds tinny even when increasing the volume. The Pink Noise measurement clearly illustrates that the mid-range and high tones are relatively linear while low tones below 250 Hz are virtually absent in the sound characteristics.. The playback quality using the 3.5-mm jack alongside DTS-HD Premium Sound is good and also sufficiently loud.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 32.4 35.6 25 31.3 35.2 31 31.7 35.8 40 26 27.6 50 39.4 36.2 63 36.2 34.2 80 28.6 27.7 100 25.4 25.1 125 21.3 23 160 23.3 26.1 200 22.5 32.2 250 22.4 40.1 315 21.3 46.4 400 18.4 54.6 500 17.5 63.2 630 17.5 64.3 800 17.2 68.3 1000 16.8 71.1 1250 17.3 72.8 1600 17.4 72 2000 16.6 73.1 2500 17.3 73 3150 17.6 72.9 4000 17.6 74.1 5000 17.7 72.7 6300 17.4 73.1 8000 17.7 72.9 10000 17.9 72.1 12500 18.1 73.9 16000 18.1 75.8 SPL 29.8 84.3 N 1.3 57.6 median 17.7 Acer Liquid Zest Plus median 72 Delta 1.6 12 40.4 33.1 32.4 40.4 36.9 35.6 31.3 36.9 31.4 28.9 31.7 31.4 31.2 27.3 26 31.2 36.9 35.6 39.4 36.9 31.1 27.9 36.2 31.1 30.2 23.2 28.6 30.2 23.9 24.5 25.4 23.9 24.6 24.2 21.3 24.6 26 22.1 23.3 26 32.1 29.1 22.5 32.1 41.9 38.1 22.4 41.9 52.5 45.5 21.3 52.5 55.8 52.6 18.4 55.8 63.8 59.6 17.5 63.8 70.3 67.2 17.5 70.3 70.9 69 17.2 70.9 75.7 73.6 16.8 75.7 75.3 73.4 17.3 75.3 76.3 72.5 17.4 76.3 77.3 74.4 16.6 77.3 76.8 74 17.3 76.8 75.6 71.9 17.6 75.6 74 71 17.6 74 73.5 71.2 17.7 73.5 73.2 70.4 17.4 73.2 70.2 66.7 17.7 70.2 70.3 67.1 17.9 70.3 63.6 60.4 18.1 63.6 52.1 48.7 18.1 52.1 86.5 83.6 29.8 86.5 64.7 54.4 1.3 64.7 median 70.3 Acer Liquid Z630S median 67.1 median 17.7 median 70.3 13 13.2 1.6 13 35.3 42.1 32.4 35.3 31.1 30 31.3 31.1 34.6 30.7 31.7 34.6 33.7 33.6 26 33.7 37.4 36.6 39.4 37.4 34.5 26.8 36.2 34.5 27.6 26.7 28.6 27.6 26.1 24.3 25.4 26.1 24.6 26.1 21.3 24.6 24.2 22.7 23.3 24.2 21.6 20.9 22.5 21.6 26.9 21.7 22.4 26.9 37.7 30.5 21.3 37.7 47.4 41.4 18.4 47.4 59.6 52.9 17.5 59.6 68.9 62 17.5 68.9 75.8 69.8 17.2 75.8 75.3 69.8 16.8 75.3 70.1 65.1 17.3 70.1 66.7 61.3 17.4 66.7 66.4 60.2 16.6 66.4 67.6 61 17.3 67.6 66.9 61.3 17.6 66.9 67.8 62.1 17.6 67.8 69.9 63.9 17.7 69.9 74.9 69 17.4 74.9 80.5 75 17.7 80.5 81.6 76.7 17.9 81.6 71.8 66.9 18.1 71.8 55.6 50 18.1 55.6 85.6 80.1 29.8 85.6 59.2 42 1.3 59.2 median 66.9 Asus ZenFone Max ZC550KL median 61.3 median 17.7 median 66.9 13.8 13.9 1.6 13.8 32.6 33.3 32.4 32.6 35.9 33.4 31.3 35.9 35.1 24.9 31.7 35.1 35.1 30.8 26 35.1 40.1 37.3 39.4 40.1 32.4 29.3 36.2 32.4 27 24 28.6 27 25.2 27.5 25.4 25.2 24.7 27.2 21.3 24.7 27 23.5 23.3 27 29.5 23.3 22.5 29.5 40.4 25.7 22.4 40.4 48.7 28.1 21.3 48.7 55.2 35.5 18.4 55.2 63.3 43.3 17.5 63.3 67.7 47.7 17.5 67.7 74.7 54.7 17.2 74.7 76.7 58 16.8 76.7 75.1 56.2 17.3 75.1 73.1 53.9 17.4 73.1 73 52.7 16.6 73 71.4 51.4 17.3 71.4 71.7 51.7 17.6 71.7 72.7 51.5 17.6 72.7 74.6 54.5 17.7 74.6 74.8 54.6 17.4 74.8 73 53.1 17.7 73 71.8 52 17.9 71.8 64.9 44.7 18.1 64.9 49.7 29.6 18.1 49.7 85.2 65.5 29.8 85.2 62.2 18.6 1.3 62.2 median 71.4 Archos 50 Power median 51.4 median 17.7 median 71.4 13 10.5 1.6 13 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Users dependent on a long battery life will find Acer's Liquid Zest Plus to be a good alternative to existing long-running smartphones on the market. Everyone else can find better and higher-quality models, such as. Honor's 5C , for a street price of around 200 Euros (~$225).. In particular, the high-contrast IPS panel, the decent music playback quality via speaker and 3.5-mm jack, dual-SIM functionality, and long battery life in the Wi-Fi test have to be highlighted here. The latter is, however, at the expense of performance (weak SoC) and a superior technical configuration (720p resolution vs. 1080p) - both features are actually no longer contemporary for a 200-Euro (~$225), 5.5-inch handset. Furthermore, the plastic casing lacks a bit of quality feel compared with smartphones made of metal or glass.. Acer Liquid Zest Plus - 2016-09-14 09/14/2016 v5.1 Marcus Herbrich.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Acer's Liquid Zest Plus phone offers a little extra spice. With a huge battery, 13-megapixel camera and high-quality audio, Acer's Liquid Zest Plus manages to surprise with a low price.. by May 29, 2016 7:38 PM PDT. For a phone that's going to cost just $199 or £199 (around AU$275) Acer sure has tried put a lot into the 5.5-inch frame of the Liquid Zest Plus.. Big battery and big camera are the two initial stand outs. The 5,000 mAh battery is significantly bigger than some flagship phones that have been renowned for their lifespan: Samsung's latest Note, for example, has just 3,000 mAh. Similarly the 13-megapixel rear camera isn't what you'd expect from a sub-$200 phone.. But they aren't the only tricks the Zest Plus has up its fairly plain sleeve. The battery has a quick charge system that'll get it to 50 percent capacity in just one hour and it can even be used to charge other phones.. The camera has what Acer is calling a "hybrid tri-focusing system" which means it pulls focus fast: In just 0.3 seconds, in fact. Selfie fans (and aren't we all these days) should get a kick from the 85-degree angle on the 5-megapixel front facing camera. There's even an automatic selfie mode that uses face detection and you can shake the handset to start an automatic selfie timer.. The Liquid Zest Plus even comes with DTS-HD sound, dual-SIM capacity and a bluelight shield for night use. Of course, the real question is what did Acer leave out to get that low price tag?. We should get some deeper information on the Acer Liquid Zest Plus in a few days when Computex 2016 in in full swing, so stand by for some hands-on impressions later this week..

more ... more .... more ... more .... Release date: Jul 1, 2016. View all photos (5). Low pixel density screen (267 ppi). The Acer Liquid Zest Plus includes a 5.5-inch display, along with a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera. There's no word on the SoC, but given the ~$250 price point, one should expect a Snapdragon 410 or similarly-powered chipset under the hood. Likewise, we'd expect the processor to be accompanied by 2 gigs of RAM or thereabouts.. Dimensions: 6.07 x 3.05 x 0.39 inches (154.3 x 77.4 x 9.8 mm). Weight: 6.17 oz (175 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus (Phase detection, Laser). Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Quad-core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Talk time: 24.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 45.8 days (1100 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Hall (for flip covers). Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 21 Apr 2016. Shopping information MSRP price: € 199 / $ 199. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

A mid-tier phone, so don't expect lightning quick speed. That's how long Acer claims its new Liquid Zest Plus smartphone can last you, although realistically, you're probably looking at closer to two with normal usage. Nonetheless, by 2016's standards, it's not something to turn your nose up at.. To make the magic happen, Acer has placed inside a 5,000mAh battery. For context, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge packs in a 3,600 mAh battery. Acer's phone also has the benefit of quick charging, the result of which should require a lot less time juicing up.. The phone itself is nice; nothing incredibly beautiful, but it shows that Acer is giving more love to design than before. It's a mid-tier phone in 2016, one that stocks a decent looking 5.5-inch IPS screen, 2GB of RAM and Android 6.0 Marshmallow onboard.. Acer also talked a lot about the 13-megapixel camera, which it's particularly proud of. The camera uses a holy tech trinity of laser focus, face detection and contract detection autofocus to spruce up photos.. I found the contrast detection to be the most notable effect, and overall it's a good camera, although I'd need to take it off the show floor to see how well it really fares. The phone also has HD DTS audio, so you'll get solid sound from those speakers.. That stuff is nice, but my favorite feature of the phone is the optional front cover, which can be added or removed by swapping the rear casing of the phone. The cover has a long, ovular space in which certain notifications and controls will appear.. It's not a new concept by any stretch, but it's clever and looks really nice on the Zest Plus. I could change my music, adjust the volume, see a weather forecast, and get calendar updates - all of which looked vibrant on the front of the phone. You can also read messages, although given the lack of space to read them in, you'll probably just open the case anyway.. I've been picking up various Acer phones over the years, but this is the first time I'd really be happy to use one on a regular basis. It looks good and its battery life seems to be fantastic, but its mid-range specs mean that it's not the zippiest of phones out there. The so-so IPS display holds it down a bit, too.. We've not yet got a price for the Liquid Zest Plus, or any confirmation of where it might launch. Expect to see it popping up this year though.. While this one's clearly all about the battery, the Zest Plus is a good looking phone, too. Its mid-tier specs bring it down from flagship status, but if you're looking in that part of the market and find battery life to be your biggest bugbear, this could be a good choice. If it ever comes to your country, that is.. What is a hands on review?. 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it.

Acer Liquid Zest Plus review: With a 5,000mAh battery, this baby will last you awhile. Android / Mobile / Mobile Reviews / Reviews. Posted on April 29, 2017. The blue review unit I have tries to mimic the look of brushed aluminum but in reality, it is all plastic.. Specifications Android 6.0 Accelerometer Gyro sensor Hall effect sensor Light sensor Proximity sensor Multi-SIM Bluetooth 4.0 MediaTek MT6735 1.30GHz processor 2GB RAM 16GB storage MicroSD card support 5.5″ IPS HD 720p display 13MP rear camera and 5MP front camera 5,000 mAh battery What’s In The Box Acer Liquid Zest Plus Charging brick MicroUSB charging cable Headphones Flip case Documentation Design Display Software/Ecosystem Performance Speakers/Sound Camera Reception/Call Quality Battery Life Price/Value Wrap Up *We were sent a review unit of the Acer Liquid Zest Plus for the purposes of this review.. Not everyone is looking to buy the latest and greatest $750+ flagship smartphone. Some people actually have a much smaller budget and don’t mind sacrificing power to save some money. There is one thing high-end smartphone buyers and budget smartphone buyers will agree on though, battery life. The Acer Liquid Zest Plus houses a massive 5,000mAh battery and that sucker is going to last for a good long time. While the battery is amazing on the Liquid Zest Plus, not everything is perfect, but that’s to be expected from a budget device. Read on for our full review of the Acer Liquid Zest Plus, this isn’t going to be the choice for everyone, but for some, it will do.. The Acer Liquid Zest Plus has the following features and specifications:. The Acer Liquid Zest Plus has a pretty non-distinct design language, pretty much looking like a generic slab smartphone. The blue review unit I have tries to mimic the look of brushed aluminum but in reality, it is all plastic. The phone feels thicker than most phones but with a 5,000mAh built-in battery, I guess there should be some thickness. The only real distinct design cue on this phone is the front ear piece. It is recessed and round and is trimmed with chrome, not a bad looking little touch. The Acer logo is also on the front along with the front facing 5MP camera.. Around the back of the phone, you’ll find the 13MP camera and LED flash along with more Acer branding and the dts-HD speaker. The MicroUSB port is at the bottom of the phone and the headphone jack is at the top. On the right side is where you’ll find the volume rocker and power button, the SIM slot and MicroSD card slot are behind the removable back. You should note that the battery is not removable on the Acer Liquid Zest Plus.. Overall the design isn’t the most stunning or striking, it’s a budget phone and commands a budget design. It’s not awful in its looks, but you’re certainly not going to get many questions about it, unless someone is curious about its battery life. The 5.5″ IPS 720p display isn’t the greatest I’ve ever seen, but again, we’re talking a budget smartphone here. Colors are decent, not super vibrant but it is at least palatable. Contrast is okay, not the deepest or best ever and whites are acceptable but do have a slightly off-white color. There was some stuttering when scrolling and pinch-to-zoom, being a budget smartphone I fully expected to not get fluid and fast screen response.. Yes, there are far better display’s on phones these days but for $179.99USD this display isn’t the worst I’ve ever seen. The plus side of this display is that it’s a 720p panel and is pushing way fewer pixels which gives you even more battery from that already massive 5,000mAh battery pack.. The Liquid Zest Plus ships with Android 6.0 and after asking Acer, it is not slated to see an upgrade to 7.0. This isn’t much of a surprise either, many budget phones never see their OS upgraded to the latest version as it can get costly for companies to do so. While it would have been nice to see Android 7.0 on this, Android 6.0 is still functional and works well on this phone. Overall the Acer skin is minimal and this looks like a mostly clean version of Android.. That being said, there are Acer specific apps which we think were unnecessary but again, that’s to be expected from budget phones. You can pretty much ignore all of the apps you don’t want or need here and just go about your day, but they do take up space on your phone which is a bit annoying. Android 6.0 works well and you have full access to the Google Play Store so that’s at least a good point. Overall, we wish there was a planned 7.0 upgrade but you won’t be so lucky should you pick one of these up.. Android 6.0 but no Android 7.0 coming.. With a MediaTek MT6735 processor pushing this thing around, it’s not the most powerful phone on the market. Normal day to day browsing and email generally work fine though scrolling and pinch to zoom were sometimes janky. Gaming is okay although more graphic intense games did struggle a bit with the phone heating up a bit during heavy load. Once again, none of the specs on the Liquid Zest are meant to compete with high-end phones so we can’t expect massive performance here. This phone is suitable for light gaming, web browsing, email, and social media but you might be sure to close unused programs from the background from time to time. Overall not a great performing phone but at sub $200USD, you can’t expect this to perform on an even $500USD level.. First, let’s just admit that most smartphone speakers aren’t really all that great. With the exception of a few notable high-end phones, speakers on smartphones are generally awful. That being said, Acer advertises dts-HD sound on this phone so I was hoping for something semi-decent from this phone. I have to say, I was not met with what I had hoped to hear. The rear facing speaker isn’t great at all, it’s not awful, but it certainly isn’t HD sound. The speaker was a pretty big disappointment but it’s really no worse than any other budget smartphone speaker on the market.. The 5MP and 13MP cameras aren’t the best by any means but they do get the job done. Low light performance is not at all good but photos taken in good sunlight actually come out decent enough for a camera in this price range. If you’re looking for a point and shoot replacement in a smartphone, this probably isn’t going to be it. Still, the cameras manage to catch decent enough images in ideal lighting so just keep that in mind when using the camera. You can take photos in low-light they’ll just be a bit grainier than you’d probably prefer, still, budget phones will give you budget results.. The 13MP camera and LED flash.. Reception and call quality were both good, nothing much to complain about here.. With a whopping 5,000mAh battery, this thing easily lasted a few days with regular use. It helps that the screen is only 720p as there aren’t nearly as many pixels for the GPU to push around. If you’re a conservative user, you could really stretch the use here to over three days depending on settings. You can also charge other devices with the Liquid Zest, something other phones have done in the past and can come in handy. Battery life is insane on this phone and if you need a budget phone with super battery life, this is the one.. For $179USD you’re getting a decently capable budget phone and the value is there.. Remember, this is a budget phone. You cannot expect mid-range or high-end specs for the price you’re paying here. There will be sacrifices to be made. The Acer Liquid Zest Plus isn’t the nicest, most capable phone on the market and it’s strongest point is the insane battery. So if you’re looking for a budget phone that does everything just okay but does battery life the best, this may be the phone for you.. Nailed it Decent display Good battery life Decent price, though on the higher end of budget. Needs work No upgrade to Android 7.0 A little thicker than other phones Speakers are not very good Some slow performance Acer bloatware.

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The Acer Liquid Zest Plus ; the name alone screams like something straight out of your bathroom cleaning closet, so it might very well might help get those tough hard water stains. Jokes aside, this mid-range phablet of sorts was announced at Acer’s press event in New York City – the only new smartphone announced for its portfolio. While it might be hard to take the Acer Liquid Zest Plus seriously, even with the obnoxious name, it definitely turn heads with its “ under $250 ” price point when it goes on sale.. To be blunt, there’s really nothing about the design that strikes us. Call it conventional or call it mundane; this plastic-constructed smartphone very much looks like Acer’s previous efforts in its lower-to-mid range Liquid series. And of course, the mid-range attachment is quite evident here, as the plastic construction doesn’t necessarily give us confidence with its hollowness. Sure, the material helps to give it a lightweight feel in the hand, but it’s nowhere remotely close to achieving the same level of meticulousness and craftsmanship we see in today’s high-end devices.. Yet again, the sub-$250 pricing is no doubt its saving grace. For the price, you’re getting an Android 6.0 Marshmallow running smartphone that features a 5.5-inch HD screen with Zero Air Gap, MediaTek MT6735 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, 5MP wide-angle front camera, and a “ tri-focus ” 13MP rear camera. The latter sounds intriguing in itself, but it’s just jargon. for a camera configuration that consists of laser, phase detection, and contrast detection focusing.. We checked it out quickly in our brief time with the handset. we’ll say it definitely helps cuts down on the focusing time once the camera is up and running. Looking at some of the samples we shot with the phone, it’s really tough to gauge their quality through the phone’s screen. They look good, but contrasting light sources seem to make it difficult for it to produce a neutral exposure throughout the scene. Again, this is just all preliminary stuff. Shutterbugs, however, with be delighted with the full manual control mode.. As for the Android 6.0 Marshmallow experience that’s running on the Acer Liquid Zest Plus, it’s really no different from most other Android phones running a stock experience, so it’s a shoe-in for those comfortable already with it. Being a mid-ranger, there’s always going to be that reluctance for some to make it their daily driver, just because it’s unknown if Acer will proactively send out software updates to bring it up to the latest Android experience. It’s nice that it’s Marshmallow out of the get-go, but we’re not all that far away from seeing the latest, major Android update in the pipeline.. The last thing to note, this phablet is packed with a whopping 5000 mAh battery. That’s quite a hefty tally if you ask anyone, so we can only hope for better-than-average results with its battery life. On the flip side, though, it makes us wonder how long it’ll take this one to get back to full capacity.. Obnoxious as the name might be, this phone certainly has its own appeal to consumers. As a backup, the sub-$250 price might be hard to swallow, given the handful of sub-$200 phones out there already saturating the market. Still, others might otherwise end up taking a liking to the handset, especially if they’re looking for substantial savings and something that might have above-average battery life..

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $406 Buy.

When we called our software “One Click” Root, we really meant it!.. Four Easy Steps to Root Your ACER Liquid Zest Plus. How To Root ACER Liquid Zest Plus In Minutes. Download and install One Click Root. Connect your Android to your computer. Run One Click Root and let the software. One Click Root Devices ACER Acer Liquid Zest Plus. Power Up Your Acer Liquid Zest Plus' Inner Potential. Acer has announced their newest smartphone very soon after some other smartphones of the other lineup, it's the soap-sounding Liquid Zest Plus.. The company also claims their new Acer Liquid Zest Plus smartphone can last you a long time although realistically, you're probably looking at closer to two with normal usage. Nonetheless, by 2016's standards, it's not something to turn your nose up at but it's definitely a good base to start of.. The phone itself is nice, though there's really nothing incredibly beautiful, but it shows that Acer is giving more love to design than usual. The Liquid Zest Plus is a mid-tier phone in 2016, one that stocks a decent looking 5.5-inch IPS screen, bears 2GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage that's expandable through a microSD card. It runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow onboard as well. Powered by Mediatek MT6735, Quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A53, paired with Mali-T720MP2 GPU. Acer also sports a 13-megapixel camera, which it's particularly proud of. It primarily uses a holy tech trinity of laser focus, face detection and contract detection autofocus to spruce up photos; it also has Geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR, panorama features, along with its 5MP secondary camera. It has HD DTS audio so you'll get solid sound from those speakers and also features active noise cancellation with dedicated mic. It has WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, Radio, and USB for connectivity options. The Acer Liquid Zest Plus stuff is actually nice, but what will be a favorite feature of the phone is the optional front cover, which can be added or removed by swapping the rear casing of the phone. It has a long, ovular space in which certain notifications and controls will basically appear. It's definitely clever and it looks really nice on the Zest Plus. It looks really good, stylish, and unique, and its battery life seems to be fantastic with its non-removable Li-Ion 5000 mAh battery, but its mid-range specs mean that it's not the zippiest of phones out there. Nonetheless, it's absolutely worth your bucks.. Nowadays, the mainstream thing especially for Android fanatics and most tech geeks is the so called "rooting". It’s a tech process of gaining access to the device's internal system and breaks restrictions and owning the admin rights, so you can take full control over your device. Unlocking operating system allows you to explore the wonders of Android at your own risk, and enable customizations and modifications of your Android. With the rooted device, possibilities are almost near limitless. Rooting speeds up your processor, boosts battery and memory, cleans up the bloats, annoying ads, unwanted preinstalled software, and most interestingly access exclusive apps that aren't normally accessible to normal users. Unfortunately, the process isn't too simple, rather it's too complicated, risky, and dangerous. It voids warranty automatically, and may brick your device as well. Not only that, it also exposes your device to harmful malware. Thankfully, there's One Click Root that makes life a lot easier, and more convenient. It keeps your device protected 100% all throughout the process, and with support you'll get rooted the right way. Don't worry at all because it's reversible.

Android 7.0 on Acer Liquid Zest Plus :). Posts: 18 Member New User. edited January 2 in Acer Ideas. Hello we would like to have latest android version on our acer liquid zest plus. Posts: 286 Member Practitioner. I use the Zest Plus phone myself, Sprunk. I have done some checking around here but I don't yet have a good answer on OS update plans for this phone. It is running Android 6 today but it isn't yet certain if Android 7 will be provided for this model. Let's keep our fingers crossed and when I get a better answer I'll post here again. While having an update to Android 7.0 would be nice I think that would be too much to ask for a phone that isn't high end. Would be a pleasant surprise if Acer did it though. Nonetheless I'm happy with Android 6.0 and it's a very solid Android version. Android certainly has come a very very long way and it's simply very polished in Marshmallow.. Posts: 1 Member New User.

Negative: Large size; many unnecessary applications. Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 10/16/2016. Model : The Acer Liquid Zest Plus may be touted as a mid-range smartphone, yet it certainly is not an average phablet. It is equipped with a 5.5-inch display with a resolution of 720 by 1280 pixels. The device runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and its performance is powered by a 1.3 GHz MediaTek MT6735 quad-core processor with 2 GB of RAM. The internal storage of the Liquid Zest Plus has a capacity of 16 GB and up to 32 GB can be added via MicroSD slot. Although it is not NFC compliant, it is capable of supporting USB OTG devices. In addition, the phone comes with a 13 MP rear camera and a 5 MP front camera.. Ample connectivity is supported by WiFi, GPS and Bluetooth. Moreover, the phone features an FM radio receiver. One key highlight of the Liquid Zest Plus is its huge battery capacity of 5000 mAh, which arguably dispenses with the need to lug around a power bank for on-the-go charging purposes. However, the battery is not removable. The smartphone comes in two color variants, i.e. Albeit it is largely from plastic, its capacity under the hood together with a long-lasting battery will surely offer users much zest.. This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. While Acer still had the third largest global market share in the notebook segment in 2008, it ranked 6th in 2016 with a market share of 6% after they had continuously lost market shares.. There are dozens of Acer laptop reviews per month, the ratings are average (as of 2016). Gateway, which has an own laptop line-up, has also belonged to the Acer Group since 2007..

We got the chance to try out the Acer Liquid Zest Plus that features a battery that supposedly lasts 3 full days. Transcript: The best thing about the Liquid Zest line-up was the price. The handsets started at just £90 when they were released earlier this year, and while the Zest Plus isn’t quite as cheap, it brings some substantial upgrades over its siblings while still only costing around 250 €. However, the biggest feature of the Liquid Zest Plus is its enormous 5,000mAh battery that Acer claims offers up to 3 days’ usage on one charge. Phone manufacturers are often keen to tout huge battery life claims, but they rarely live up to them in real-life tests. That said, it's a genuinely huge battery, the Galaxy S7 only has 3,000mAh for example, and while it’s non removable it still delivers a solid two days of actual use with max brightness, wifi and the lot. Additionally, should your battery get low just before you head out for the day, it supports quick charging to 50 percent capacity in less than one hour to give users over a day's worth of power. There’s also a feature called USB On-The-Go technology, which lets the Zest Plus share its power with other devices, so you can charge a friend's 'lesser' handset or even your own wearable device from the handset. As a medium range device, the Zest Plus doesn’t feel as cheap as you’d expect. Yes, it’s mainly made of plastic, and it’s by no means anything to stare at in wonder. However, with a 5.5in IPS screen, the Zest Plus moves into small phablet territory, and it bright vivid colours and detailed display make it feel more expensive as a result. It's reportedly only got a 1,280x720 resolution but that's still 267 pixels-per-inch and it holds up prety well. On the inside, the Liquid Zest Plus uses a quad-core 1.3Ghz Mediatek chipset backed up by 2GB of RAM, which is a budget combination, though Android 6.0 Marshmallow ran smoothly on the sample handset. SHould you decide for an alternative ROM or remove the bloat that is present on the device with over 15 preinstalled Acer branded applications, it is sure to perform even better. On the side of the Liquid Zest Plus there’s support for either two SIM slots or a SIM slot and a microSD expansion card. Speaking of cameras, the Liquid Zest Plus includes a 13MP snapper with an ultra-fast hybrid focusing system to capture moving subjects in tough lighting. Acer said this is possible because it intelligently focuses based on the conditions: phase detection auto-focusing (PDAF) for bright daylight scenes, laser focusing for dark scenes at short distances (such as restaurants), and contrast detection auto-focusing (CDAF) to capture subjects in low light. We were able to perform a few snaps during our hands-on review and while focusing seemed fairly fast, the handset did then take a few seconds to save the photo successfully. The phone also has HD DTS audio, so you'll get solid sound from those speakers. It looks good and its battery life seems to be fantastic, but its mid-range specs mean that it's not the zippiest of phones out there. The so-so IPS display holds it down a bit, too..

Hands on with the shampoo-sounding Acer Liquid Zest Plus. Acer only announced one Android smartphone at its New York event, but it's memorable... It's safe to say the Acer Liquid Zest Plus won't be coming to North America anytime soon, but the mid-range smartphone has a couple of interesting specs that may pique your interest.. The 5.5-inch device runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow (with the April 1st security update, natch) on a skin that is as close to stock Android as we've seen from the Taiwanese company. Inside, a MediaTek MT6735 SoC and 2GB keep things running smoothly, while the 13MP rear camera boasts laser focus and phase-detection autofocus, for reasons not divulged by the company's executives — though more is better in this case, we hope.. The plastic phone feels its sub-$249 price: creaky and uninspired, in either white or black hues. A window cover, which replaces the traditional snap-on back cover and wraps around the phone's front, offers quick access to notifications and other shortcuts, but the implementation feels half-hearted at best.. Indeed, the only notable thing about this phone is the three-day battery life, facilitated by the included 5,000mAh cell. Like Lenovo's ZUK lineup , phablets targeting the Asian market are beefing up their uptime as users grow even more dependent on their pocket supercomputers.. Specific pricing and availability won't be known for some time, but rest assured we'll keep you informed if the Liquid Zest Plus should grace our carriers — or grocery stores.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL.
