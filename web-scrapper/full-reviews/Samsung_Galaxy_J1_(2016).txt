Networks: Released:. 5.0 MP camera with HD 720p video. External memory expandable up to 128 GB. Read 3 Reviews | Write a Review. Canada: Bell, MTS Mobility, chatr mobile, PC Mobile, Primus Wireless, SaskTel, Sears Connect, TELUS, Virgin Mobile, EastLink , Freedom Mobile. Reviewed on Sunday November 12, 2017 by Gordon S. This is my 4th Samsung phone: S3, S4, S7. Bought this one for another phone # I needed to activate. It is definitely memory challenged as one of the other posters mentioned. I have moved everything possibly to SD card storage, gone through ALL the settings and can normally store only 1 or two images. Most apps can't update because of no available internal memory. Samsung: SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THESE PHONES ! Display, speed etc are all great, but this single problem means that this phone is to be avoided at all costs.. Reviewed on Wednesday September 20, 2017 by Angela , Ontario. My last phone was Galaxy Core. Held lots of pictures without the extra memory card. Often obove 1500 and never ran out of room. In the end the home button stopped working so I needed a new one. Decided because this phone was not the core model it must be better somehow. The phone freezes up all the time and at this moment I have 2 photos literally on my phone and gallery won't open until I delete files. I also have an additional memory card. Apps include Facebook and messenger and photo editor. If it was free it wouldn't be worth the headache. I hate apple products (my husband uses them), but he doesn't have issues so I am seriously considering the change. To anyone thinking of buying this phone, my advice is turn around and run in the opposite direction as fast as you can!. Reviewed on Sunday August 28, 2016 by Andrew , Vancouver Canada. After all the bad reviews i have seen , I was skeptical of buying this phone,but when London Drugs put it on special for under $100 i had to take the risk..I figured reviews usually cannot be trusted and the fact that Samsung has been near perfect since the S3 with the only exception being the Grand Prime and the Core which i know people who have thse 2 models and they are not very good phones , i wen for the J120W and i give it a 9/10. Just like my old S3 it has almost all the same features..the only 2 drawbacks in the beginning were i had to download smartswitch off the app store to be able to transfer files to and from my pc..and there is no way to move apps to my external micro sd card,but i can live with that..so i unbox the phone,and as soon as i press the power button, BOOOOM, the phone starts updateing from lollipop to marshmallow , how cool is that yaaaay , that was amazing such a fast upgrade to 6.0, i am soo impressed..the screen angles are perfect , no losing quality on any angle yaaay i like the screen much better than the iphone 5 (just my opinion) but we all know apple is the devil in disguise..user interface on the J1 is smooth and fluid and the screen is just a iny bit smaller than my old S3 but not a big deal whatsoever,the feel of the phone feels comfortable in my hand and the look is not cheap even though its mainly all plastic,with light gaming and call use the battery lasted me all day so i am suprr impressed so far..takes good pictures music and video look and sound fantastic , calls sound clear. all in all Samsung have done it again, a very nice affordable phone that works as good as the high end phones,if you want one that does everything including cooking you dinner then buy the $1200 phones, me i am happy with this phone and its perfect for anyone who doesnt use the phone 24/7 365..FANTASTIC JOB SAMSUNF THUMBS UP.

A low end device with ho-hum features, further encumbered by its poor battery life. The YES 4G network however, is impressive for a newly launched offering.. Editor Rating: Fair (2.5) Jul 20, 2016. Has advanced features, like VoLTE and TD-LTE connectivity. Can carry out basic operations properly. A low end device with ho-hum features, further encumbered by its poor battery life. The YES 4G network however, is impressive for a newly launched offering.. Having finally launched its 4G LTE plans , Yes opted to partner with Samsung to get as many people as possible to use its services by bundling 30GB of free data over two months with every Samsung J-Series (2016) device sold. Of the three that have been introduced , I have in hand the Samsung Galaxy J1 (2016), the same one that the PCMag SEA Chief Editor, Victor Yap, recently unboxed .. Missed that? Here is the video again:. Now with that necessity out of the way, let's get into the review proper of the RM449 priced Samsung Galaxy J1 (2016).. We’ll be looking at two aspects here, the Samsung Galaxy J1 itself as well as seeing YES’ 4G offering on this miniscule device. The goal—to see if this is the device to being your journey on YES’ brand spanking new 4G TD-LTE network.. Miniature seems like the most appropriate word to use. At least in these times of upsize and scaling. Of course, there had once been a time when a 4in smartphone is considered a ‘larger’ offering compared with what is available on the market. However, the relatively miniscule size of the Samsung Galaxy J1 (2016), coupled with its plastic construction speaks volumes about its position in the market. Worryingly, many of its competitors have begun offering premium materials in their budget range, further hampering the image of this particular Samsung entry in the eyes of the average consumer.. Still, its rounded edges and small size makes the Samsung Galaxy J1 (2016) easy to handle; while my thumb can’t quite reach every corner of the screen, it’s certainly not as unwieldly as say, a Samsung Galaxy A7. Its plastic build also means that it has an increasingly rare feature: a removable back plate housing the battery, where the microSIM slots and microSD port is parked underneath. Word of advice, you’ll want to make use of the microSD slot as this affordable-type Samsung smartphone only comes with a paltry 8GB of onboard memory that will fill up faster than you can blink.. View All 13 Photos in Gallery. The Samsung Galaxy J1 (2016) comes with a decidedly weak WVGA panel, making this one of the blurrier displays on the market. There is not much to say or do here since it only has 480 x 800 pixels to play with. Indeed, jaggy edges abound and are especially noticeable in an age of ever denser screens. Colour reproduction, interestingly, is fair and the contrast processing is decent. Samsung has an ‘Outdoor’ mode function and it bumps the brightness up to, frankly, impressive levels, allowing clear visibility even on a sunny day. There is a short time limit to this though, and the software will throttle back the brightness eventually.. The middling 1.2GHz processor in the Samsung Galaxy J1 (2016) offered predictable performance. It is certainly a serviceable workhorse, but only so long as you keep its 1GB RAM clear of bloat. Opening multiple applications at once caused it to choke and I had to keep the foot off the pedal just so it is usable. Samsung’s Touchwiz interface has definitely improved by leap and bounds since its disastrous early days and its interference in daily usage is at a minimal, with lags few and far between.. While its Mali 400 GPU is able to play simple games like Two Dots, this tiny smartphone entrant Samsung struggled when made to deal with bigger games like Real Racing and Clash of Clans. Thusly, it's best to keep games simple. Doing so and you should have little to complain about in the Samsung Galaxy J1 (2016).. Camera and Battery Life: Just Right. The spec sheet alone, fully available on the website and listed down below, should be enough of a warning for most. Honestly, the camera on the Samsung Galaxy J1 (2016) is not exactly what you want to capture your life’s memories on. Some say the best shooters are the ones you have in your pocket, but even this won’t cut it. When used in a brightly lit outdoor environment, pictures had far too much noise, poor sharpness, and average colour reproduction. Trees looked like clumps of color and a cerulean blue sky had been reduced to a dull blue.. Needless to say, indoor photography didn’t fare any better as the main camera produced even worse images. The 2MP front camera, while nigh unusable, can at least be still salvaged with filters...just barely.. Another disappointment is the battery life. Despite its mild specs and low-res display, I could barely get the Samsung Galaxy J1 (2016) to last a full working day, even when I'm not really pushing it. Having mixed in a couple of calls, few minutes of social media browsing, and mostly messaging on Messenger brought this Samsung smartphone to its knees before the 6pm mark. Moderate gaming necessitated a plug in by lunch, which is simply unacceptable in a 2016-based phone, even for a budget offering.. Network Performance with Yes 4G: Speedy Experience. However, unlike the 2015 iteration of the Samsubg Galaxy J1 (2016), the 2016 take has finally moved on from 3G as it now wholly supports 4G LTE. This means that it is fully compatible with the 4G package currently being hawked that the self-styled comeback kid that Yes 4G has now become. What is interesting here is that Yes is offering its full-IP high capacity 4G network on the TD-LTE which utilises Band 38 and 40.. Testing the 4G service around the Klang Valley, I managed to, reliably, pull around 20- to 30Mbps, with the worst being around the Federal Highway at roughly 5Mbps. Personally, that is still pretty good as most telcos offer weak connection along that stretch of asphalt and billboards.. Suffice to say, the speeds on offer are definitely sufficient even for high quality video streaming.. The only drawback is that is some households, I struggled to get a connection due to the lack of coverage and low penetration potential it is known to use. Also, the fact that there is no 2G/3G to fall back on means that if you have no 4G connection, it’s pretty much a complete blackout from the Web.. Still, as part of its comeback effort, I'm very optimistic about the future as Yes 4G continues expands its network. Also on offer is a unique proposition in Malaysia: Voice over LTE (VoLTE). Other telcos in Malaysia normally drop you to 3G during voice calls. However, utilising VoLTE, the Samsung Galaxy J1 (2016)—strangely sporting a flagship feature like VoLTE—is able to provide a calling experience that connects calls at a noticeably faster rate. While its claimed to be clearer than usual, I felt that it is on par with other offerings on the market.. However, do take note that if you are from Sarawak, you’re out of luck as Yes 4G coverage has yet to extend to the large state.. This review is a mixed bag of results; while Yes 4G has proven to be a surprisingly competitive new entrant into the 4G space, pairing it with the Samsung Galaxy J1 (2016) might be a little bit of a stretch. This enhanced featured smart device may be positioned as an entry-level device into the world of smartphones, but given that this is a quickly maturing market, even if you are insistent on being on the Yes 4G network, there are far better entry propositions out there that such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 and its close market rivals..

My husband got a new phone which means the new case purchase is next. We found a number available on Amazon.

Bought this case for my children's 1st cell phone .. durable enough to prevent damage to their cell phones when they drop them .. because its not a matter of "if" they drop them but "when" they drop them .. I paired these cases up with the glass screen protector and I no longer cringe when I see my children carrying on with their phones ... 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy.

This is a very strong, sturdy phone case. This particular one however, never was used. The phone I bought it for was stolen. I have the same case for a Samsung Note5 and it has performed well. The only negative thing I can say is the smaller corners of the hard plastic shell have broken off. But, the case is almost 2 years old and still functions well.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars I love this case. Color: Armor Black | Verified Purchase.

Color: Armor Orange | Verified Purchase. The case is slightly too large, and the phone doesn't feel like its securely being held in there. It'll work until I can find a better case though..
