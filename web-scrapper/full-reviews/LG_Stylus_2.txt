Esto también se puede leer en español.. LG takes a second shot at courting pen fans with Stylus 2 (hands-on). The LG Stylus 2 gets a makeover and some enhanced features for the pen, but otherwise seems like a pretty familiar phone.. by February 19, 2016 2:21 PM PST. LG Stylus 2 reintroduces the retractable, 'nano-coated' pen (pictures). 5.7-inch display with 1,280x720-pixel resolution 155mm by 79.6mm by 7.4mm and 145g (6.1 by 3.1 by 0.3 inches and 5.1 ounces) 1.2GHz Quad-Core processor Rear 13-megapixel camera, 8MP on front 1.5GB RAM 16GB storage with microSD 3,000mAh battery Android 6.0 Marshmallow Mightier than the sword. Chalk up a win for LG when it comes to weird product names. If you've never heard of the LG Stylus 1 don't panic: The LG Stylus 2 is actually the "enhanced sequel" to the LG G Stylo , which was also known as the LG G4 Stylus outside of the US and Korea, just in case you weren't confused enough already.. Like its curiously named predecessor, the Stylus 2 has a large 5.7-inch screen, but it sports a slimmer and lighter design. It is set to make its physical debut at Mobile World Congress. The stylus has also been given a few enhancements, according to LG:. LG Stylus 2 reintroduces the retractable, 'nano-coated' pen (pictures). The new stylus has a slightly mysterious "nano-coated" tip, which is supposed to help with accuracy, as opposed to the rubber one of the previous generation. The updated stylus feels thin, almost borderline fragile, and the tip of the pen is a lot more narrow and fine. But it's the suite of new software features for the pen that make the biggest difference. Removing the pen now automatically gets you a pop-up menu, a la the Samsung Note range.. The Pen Keeper is designed for people who constantly lose their keys. It gives you a warning if it detects the phone moving away when the pen bay is empty. There's also a new Calligraphy Font for people with great handwriting and a burning need to show it off on their phone.. During our brief time with it, the stylus felt solidly built and secure inside the phone. With the familiar rear control buttons on the back, LG didn't mix up the device's design too much. It gave the phone a metallic-like sheen similar to the Stylo 2's predecessor, which elevates its design aesthetic just a bit.. While the 13-megapixel camera is a nice jump up from the 8MP rear snapper on the Stylo, and the 20-gram/0.7-ounce weight difference is significant, there don't seem to be too many other differences. The battery size is the same, as is the storage space, and even the processor is still a 1.2GHz quad-core, although LG hasn't gone into any further specifics on that front.. We're also not clear on pricing. The G Stylo was a mere $199 unlocked and the Stylus 2 is supposed to be "exceptionally priced." But actual figures, timing or even where the phone will be available all have yet to be revealed. Look forward to seeing it in white, "titan" and...uhhh...brown..

The likes of the LG G5 and LG X Screen hint at a manufacturer that’s obsessed with finding an angle – anything different to make its offerings stand out from the crowd.. With this comes the LG Stylus 2 – a mid-range phablet with a couple of stand-out features. But is an improved stylus and a DAB+ radio enough to recommend it over other sub-£300 Android phones?. Given the strength of the field, and a couple of underwhelming components, I’d suggest not.. WATCH: What’s the best phone you can buy?. LG showed it was capable of something approaching premium, forward-thinking design with the all-metal LG G5, but the LG Stylus 2 is a bit of a retrogressive step. It’s much more like the LG G3 , which might sound like a ringing endorsement on the surface – after all, the LG G3 was our top smartphone pick of 2014.. But of all the LG G3’s virtues, design wasn’t really one of them. It was functional and sturdy, yes, and even interesting in places. But even two years ago, it was hardly premium or even attractive.. The LG Stylus 2 shares the LG G3’s rounded back, plastic construction, and rear-mounted buttons. That final point is likely to remain a divisive one. In my view, rear-mounted buttons were an interesting experiment that should probably have been discarded by now.. It’s something you grow accustomed to with time, but the positioning simply remains less intuitive than traditional side-mounted buttons. It demands that you hold the phone in a very specific way in order to use them, which is less conducive to practical every day usage.. Also, I’m not entirely sure what the point is here. The LG Stylus 2 is fairly slim but hardly skinny at 7.4mm, and there’s ample space on its rounded plastic sides. As such, those rear-mounted buttons come across as something of a design affectation.. Otherwise, the LG Stylus 2 is a pleasant enough phone to hold in the hand. Despite its large 5.7-inch display, it doesn’t feel ridiculously big. Part of this is down to the fact that we’ve grown accustomed to “large” phones, of course. But the phone’s relative thinness and surprising lightness at 145g also contribute.. Related: Best phones to buy 2016. Of course, the LG Stylus 2’s main design feature is worn prominently in its name. On the top-right corner of the phone as you look head-on, you’ll find a Stylus Pen stashed away within the body.. The stylus itself boasts a nano-coated pen tip for a “real pen-like feel,” according to LG. In practice, I found that the stylus did indeed lend itself to more natural writing than many cheaper stylus options – although it should be noted that this is a “dumb” stylus with no degree of pressure sensitivity or control buttons..

I’ll discuss the Stylus Pen’s software implementation later, but in terms of design and feel, I’d say it’s somewhere in between the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 series and the Nintendo 3DS .. If you’re talking exclusively from the perspective of Android, where 5.5-inch displays are pretty much the norm, then the LG Stylus 2’s screen can only just be termed “big”.. Indeed, as I’ve discussed above, the Stylus 2’s 5.7-inch IPS LCD panel fits comfortably in the hand – although of course, even those with long fingers will need to employ their other hand for anything short of checking the lockscreen or scrolling through a web page.. It would be silly to criticise the LG Stylus 2 screen for being “too big” then, but I’ll certainly criticise it for not being sharp enough.. Despite that larger-than-average display, LG has opted for a mere 720p resolution. That results in a pixel density of just 258ppi. Practically speaking, it means that you won’t be able to watch Full HD video content on your new phablet, which is absurd.. You might argue that this isn’t a premium device, and at a cost of £250 (£220 on O2 PAYG) you’d be quite right. But let’s just look at some alternative examples here. The Moto G4 and the Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 both come with 5.5-inch 1080p displays – you can argue among yourselves whether that still constitutes a “phablet” – yet both phones cost around £100 less.. I’d argue that manufacturers can no longer justify opting for a 720p resolution for any display of 5 inches or above, unless they’re going for an entry-level spec and a £100-or-less price tag.. Sharpness aside, the LG Stylus 2’s screen isn’t too bad. Colours seem more vibrant, whites whiter, and viewing angles better than many cheaper phones, such as Vodafone’s aforementioned 1080p bargain.. It isn’t especially bright, though, and I found myself needing to crank up the brightness slider to 75%, even when using it indoors. Outside, you’ll need to go the whole hog if you want to be able to see anything.. This isn’t entirely unusual for a low-end phone, but I’d feel more comfortable excusing it here if the LG Stylus 2 came in at or under the £200 mark. It’s in a bit of a no-mans-land, as if you can stretch to £300 then you can start considering the likes of the OnePlus 3 and the Vodafone Smart Platinum 7 – both of which offer significantly better displays (and everything else for that matter)..

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 16 GB + MicroSD. View all photos (6). Thin body, measuring less than 7.5mm/0.3inches (0.29 inches). Too little RAM memory (1.5 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (258 ppi). The Stylus 2 sports the same 5.7-inch 720p display that we can find on the G Stylo, though it's thinner (7.4 mm) and lighter (145 grams) than its predecessor. The new handset doesn't offer too many upgraded features - it's still got a quad-core 1.2 GHz processor (we assume it's the Snapdragon 410), LTE connectivity, 16 GB of expandable storage space, and a 3000 mAh battery. There's a little bit more RAM on the Stylus 2, though (1.5 GB, compared to just 1 GB on the G Stylo), while the cameras have been bumped to 13 MP (rear) and 8 MP (front).. OS: Android (6.0), LG UX UI. Dimensions: 6.10 x 3.13 x 0.29 inches (155 x 79.6 x 7.4 mm). Weight: 5.11 oz (145 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Quad-core, 1200 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: DLNA, Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular Data: LTE Cat 4 (150/50 Mbit/s), HSDPA+ (4G) 42.2 Mbit/s. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: NFC, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Enhanced Stylus Pen Offers Easy Note Taking and Drawing Experience. 16, 2016 — LG Electronics (LG) will unveil its new LG Stylus 2, the enhanced sequel to the G4 Stylus, at MWC 2016 to be held in Barcelona, Spain. The exceptionally-priced 5.7-inch handset shares many of premium features available on LG’s flagship models but also includes a pen with a nano-coated tip for more accuracy compared to the previous rubber-tipped pen.. The device features a set of proprietary functions developed specifically for the LG Stylus 2 to enhance the user experience such as Pen Pop, which toggles a popup menu when the stylus is removed to offer shortcuts to Pop Memo and Pop Scanner. Also new to LG Stylus 2 is Pen Keeper, which prevents the stylus from being misplaced by displaying a popup message when the phone is detected as being in motion when the stylus bay is empty. What’s more, the new Calligraphy Pen font allows one to write as beautifully and decoratively as if using a fountain pen.. Only 7.4mm thin and weighing 145g, the LG Stylus 2 is noticeably thinner and lighter than its predecessor. The handset delivers a unique design statement with the incorporation of a Protruded Flat Display in the front, Spin Hairline pattern on the back and metallic frames on all its edges. The LG Stylus 2 sports a hefty 3,000mAh removable battery and a SD card slot to allow users to enjoy a variety of multimedia content on its large 5.7-inch screen.. “LG Stylus 2 provides both the big screen and premium notetaking functions of a premium large phone at a price of a mid-tier phone,” said Juno Cho, president and CEO of LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company. “This device is another example of our commitment to the mass-tier segment where there is so much opportunity for growth and creativity.”.

Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. LG brings a smarter pen experience to the Stylus 2. The sequel boasts a few new tricks for its pointer this year.. LG's promised trickle of details leading up to the G5's debut is in full force, but it's also teasing out at least one other model. Like last year , the outfit is selling a stylus-equipped phablet, the LG Stylus 2. Here's to hoping that the Korean tech company keeps that nomenclature from the prepared release rather than making us Yanks and folks in Korea request a "Stylo" again.. Other than that, the phone has a few smart features to go with its latest pointer/input method. Taking the stylus out of its holder triggers Pen Pop, a shortcut menu where the Pop Memo and Pop Scanner apps reside. The Stylus 2 also has built-in tools to make sure you don't leave the fancy finger-replacement behind as well. Should the phone detect motion when the stylus tunnel is empty, Pen Keeper will pop an alert.. As far as hardware goes, expect a 5.7-inch, 1280 x 720 screen; 1.2 GHz processor and a 13 MP camera on the back. Nothing too crazy in that regard..

Florian Wimmer ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 06/28/2016. Android ARM Phablet Smartphone Touchscreen. Is the stylus the star? LG's Stylus 2 already points to the pen in the name. However, the phablet offers a feature that steals the show from the stylus. Find out what this is in our report..

The Korean manufacturer introduces an affordable mid-range smartphone that supports the name-giving stylus which is integrated into the casing ex-factory and is dubbed LG Stylus 2. However, that is not the only top highlight that LG gives to its phone: The Stylus 2 is the first smartphone in the world (according to LG) that supports receiving the DAB+ digital radio standard that is replacing FM reception next year.. A removable battery, big HD screen and 13-megapixel camera are also installed. The SoC is sooner a slow model. How does LG's Stylus 2 perform in the test, and is stylus inputting or DAB+ reception the smartphone's killer feature?. Presently many smartphones that want to be special are found in the low-cost mid-range: Asus' ZenFone Max offers an especially big battery, OnePlus' 2 and Huawei's P9 Lite try to add premium range feeling for little money, and Huawei's G8 tries to lure customers with its stylish design.. Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 MSM8916 Qualcomm Adreno 306. Test device courtesy of LG Deutschland. (download rating image as PNG or SVG ).

Primarily Chinese manufacturers as well as Samsung's low-cost and good Galaxy A lineup have made metal casings in the mid-range very popular. LG does not connect to this trend with the Stylus 2 but relies on plastic all over instead. That also saves weight: With 142 grams, LG's Stylus 2 is the lightest among the comparison devices although it is the biggest smartphone at the same time.. The stability could be better: Pressure on both the front and back becomes visible on the screen. At least it is difficult to warp the handset, which then produces a quiet cracking noise. The smartphone is pleasant to hold thanks to rounded edges, but its size does not make it as suitable for small hands.. The handset is presently available only in the color combination black/brown. The front is black, and the sides and back are brown. The smartphone's removable back cover features a concentric circle pattern that feels high-quality and slip-proof. The user can access the nano-SIM slot, micro-SIM slot and removable battery under it. A bit inconvenient: The SIM card can only be replaced after removing the battery.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. LG's Stylus 2 only has 1.5 GB of working memory. 16 GB of storage capacity is normal for this category. The micro-SD reads cards of up to 128 GB. NFC is on board, but USB OTG is not supported.. Radio reception is certainly a special feature of the configuration as it is possible via DAB+ and FM. DAB+ allegedly involves a multitude of advantages: For example, some local radio stations can be received everywhere in Germany, and considerably more stations are possible. Only about 20% of the signal strength is needed for clear reception, and the standard allows transmitting information about songs and news or even photos and videos with the signal. LG relies on this feature especially in Germany, where a lot of radio is heard, for marketing its Stylus 2.. A symbol that displays the reception's signal strength appears in the upper left when the preloaded DAB+ app is opened. Headphones have to be connected for reception because they act as antennas. Audio output via speakers is also possible. The signal strength in our city office was quite weak, and it was only possible to hear radio via DAB+ near a window. In return, it was no problem receiving FM radio stations. The situation improved outdoors where we always had good reception in the city. Reception was no problem in other places, and even photos were transmitted.. The app is nicely designed and offers favorites, a widget mode and other things. However, the translation is not always correct, and album covers or the like were not transmitted in our test. DAB+ unfortunately still makes a somewhat undeveloped impression simply because DAB+ reception is not yet widespread. Thus, it is not really LG's fault. Nevertheless, it is not a killer feature in its present state.. Lower edge: 3.5 mm audio jack, USB 2.0. LG uses Android 6.0.1 with the security patch from 04/01/2016. The manufacturer strongly modifies the Android graphics. However, navigating through the operating system is the same so that users will quickly get used to it.. The preloaded apps are primarily related to both the most important features: The stylus and DAB+ reception. We find the app "Pop Scanner" interesting; parts of a photo can be cut and edited, making a clean "scan" of a document possible. It is ultimately not much more than a program for quickly cutting photos and the app does this job quite well.. The Stylus offers diverse features for making notes otherwise, either as a widget via the home screen or in full-screen mode. A small menu of apps where the stylus is especially useful opens when it is taken out of its slot. This is similar to the solution in Samsung's Galaxy Note lineup. Also interesting: The stylus can be used on a disabled screen, which naturally enables it. An app for making notes opens directly when the stylus is removed in standby mode. The black background makes it look as if the user is writing on a disabled screen.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

LG's Stylus 2 offers its user four GSM, four UMTS and five LTE frequencies. That should be enough in Europe, and the smartphone supports three of the four most frequently used LTE bands in the world. However, it will not be easy finding a network with the European LG Stylus 2 model in Asia.. The smartphone transmits data at a maximum of 150 Mbps (download) and 50 Mbps (upload). Among the comparison devices, only OnePlus' 2 supports higher speeds. The reception in an urban area is quite good in the well-developed German Vodafone network. We almost always had the full signal even indoors.. The Wi-Fi network standards 802.11 b/g/n are supported. Thus, it is not possible to use the 5 GHz range. The reception quality is good: Websites open quickly and the full signal is available near the router. Three-quarters of the signal is still received ten meters away and through three walls. We could not be tracked via the GPS module indoors. It took quite a while until enough satellites were found for localization outdoors. The signal was then unstable and disrupted occasionally then. The maximum accuracy was seven meters. In total, a mediocre performance from the GPS module.. To test how LG's Stylus 2 fares in practice, we took it on a mountain bike ride along with Garmin's Edge 500 professional navigation system. The measured route deviated by 70 meters, which is not much in relation to the 12-kilometer route. Garmin's Edge 500 is clearly superior to our review sample in terms of accuracy. LG's Stylus 2 repeatedly draws straight lines when the signal between two points is lost. Thus, we often seemed to ride through a meadow although we always stayed on the road..

LG has modified the phone app slightly. However, it provides the same features as Google's stock app. The keypad fades in directly when opened and matching contacts are displayed during inputs. Tabs for call lists, contacts and groups are also displayed. The app can also be placed over the smartphone's home screen (overlay).. Call quality is acceptable: Our contact understood us well; the microphone is very sensitive. This involves the advantage that we are heard well even when talking quietly. However, the sound also overdrives quickly. Sound from the earpiece is quite thin. We could barely hear the low tones of our contact's voice. The sound also hums very audibly at volumes of over 70%. It is overall better when using hands-free mode, but our contact sounds a bit tinny here, as well.. The cameras on the rear and on the front have the common resolutions for this category on paper. The primary camera has a resolution of 13 megapixels alongside a simple LED flash and records videos in 1080p. The selfie camera offers 8 megapixels, which is a higher resolution than some comparison devices can offer. However, it has often been proved that conclusions about photo quality cannot be made automatically based on the sensor's resolution.. The color reproduction of the front camera's photos looks quite natural and they are brightened well even in dark areas (visible beams below the bridge in scene 1). However, the sky outshines the edges of darker objects before it. The image sharpness is good but slightly decreases toward the photo's edge. The photos blur quite fast in low-light conditions. Some comparison devices deliver a considerably better performance here.. The photos of the primary camera are also well-illuminated and relatively sharp. However, fast movements look hazy due to just 30 frames per second.. The rear camera also offers a good color reproduction and the sharpness is satisfactory.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. For making more precise statements about the primary camera's sharpness and color reproduction, we photograph our reference card in defined light conditions. The photo also looks fairly sharp in the total view. The colors are perhaps a bit too dark. Blurred outlines, particularly in transitions from black to colors, are seen in the detail magnification. It is also seen here that the sharpness visibly decreases toward the edges. The color reproduction is somewhat too bright, with exception of black that is darker than the reference, in the comparison with the reference color space. Subjectively, the colors look very vivid here.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. LG's Stylus 2 comes with a charger, USB charging cable and an in-ear headset. The stylus is already inserted into its slot in the casing when delivered.. LG speaks of a Quick View Cover on the product page. Information like time and notifications are displayed on a visible part on a long side of the screen. However, this cover is not found as a standalone product on LG's website, and it is also difficult to find on the Internet. A British retailer presently lists it at almost Â£28, equivalent to around 36.50 Euros (~$40).. A warranty period of 24 months is included.. LG modifies the virtual keyboard, and it can be configured with quite extensive settings. For example, the keyboard's height can be adapted at will, swipe gestures can be turned on and off or input via handwriting can be enabled. Many functions can be reached directly via quick accesses on the keyboard. It is also possible to type accurately using the keyboard on the large screen of LG's Stylus 2. Google's keyboard can be enabled in the settings or a completely different keyboard can be downloaded from Google's Play Store when preferred.. The touchscreen is accurate into the corners, and its handling is precise. Since the physical controls are on the rear of many LG devices, the smartphone can be reactivated via double tapping the screen, which is handy in many situations. On the other hand, the smartphone sometimes wakes up when in a pocket.. The stylus is certainly the highlight of all input options. It is a true rarity in this price range. Although it does not support pressure levels making it rather unsuitable for artists, the preloaded apps detect how fast the user is writing and accordingly displays thinner lines (fast) or thicker lines (slow). This leads to a quite appealing calligraphy effect. The stylus can generally be used for managing the operating system, which also functioned well.. With a screen size of 5.7-inches, LG's Stylus 2 is a genuine phablet, i.e. a smartphone that borders on the size of a tablet. Its resolution of 1280x720 pixels is then quite low for this and leads to a PPI density (pixel per inch density) of 258.. Almost all comparison devices offer higher resolutions on somewhat smaller screens. Thus, their PPI is much higher. When looking more closely, it becomes evident that the reproduction on LG's Stylus 2 is not as crisp as, for example, on OnePlus' 2. This is particularly visible when looking at the icons' small lettering.. The screen brightness is also quite low: We measured a maximum of 388 cd/mÂ², and even just 383 cd/mÂ² in the practical APL50 test. The comparison devices offer considerably brighter screens. The brightness does not surpass these rates even when the light sensor is illuminated.. At least the illumination of 92% is relatively homogeneous so that large colored areas make an evenly bright impression.. 378 cd/m² 358 cd/m² 357 cd/m² 373 cd/m² 370 cd/m² 366 cd/m² 387 cd/m² 387 cd/m² 388 cd/m². 92 % Center on Battery: 370. cd/m²) ΔE Color 6.1 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 7 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.25.

We quite like the low black level of 0.25 cd/mÂ², which results in an equally impressive contrast ratio of 1480:1. However, colors look a bit faded on the screen. The fraction of blue in the image can be reduced via "Reader" mode, which spares the eyes and makes it easier to fall asleep at night, for example.. The CalMAN software in conjunction with a spectrophotometer allows more precise statements about color reproduction. A visible bluish tint that particularly distorts bright grayscale levels is evident here without the above mentioned Reader mode. The aberrations from the reference color space are quite big, and thus the user should not rely on the screen's colors for prepress repros. Especially blue colors deviate strongly from the original.. Response Time Black to White 19 ms ... rise â and fall â combined ↗ 10 ms rise ↘ 9 ms fall The screen shows good response rates in our tests, but may be too slow for competitive gamers. In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.8 (minimum) to 240 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (26.5 ms). Response Time 50% Grey to 80% Grey 48 ms ... rise â and fall â combined ↗ 22 ms rise ↘ 26 ms fall The screen shows slow response rates in our tests and will be unsatisfactory for gamers. In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. Reflections and the low brightness make it difficult to easily recognize screen content on cloudy days outdoors. Nothing can be recognized when bright sunlight shines on the screen. The user will have to find a shaded place.. Slight brightness aberrations are visible when the smartphone is tilted in different directions. However, the image remains stable even in very flat angles thanks to IPS technology.. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 410 MSM8916 in our review sample has four cores and clocks at 1.4 GHz. It is a comparatively weak model; much stronger processors are found among the comparison devices. Consequently, our review sample is in one of the last places compared with equally priced devices in the processor and system benchmarks. Asus' ZenFone Max is on par since it is based on the same SoC.. An Adreno 306 is the installed graphics solution. It clocks at 450 MHz and, compared with equally priced devices, it supplies LG's Stylus 2 with less performance in the benchmarks.. Despite that, it is possible to perform routine work decently with LG's Stylus 2. Performance is normally no issue even in LG's Dual Window mode where two apps run adjacently. Animations occasionally stuttered a bit, but that was tolerable.. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) LG Stylus 2.

LG's Stylus 2 holds its ground in games. The screen's low resolution certainly contributes to this. Although it only achieved a frame rate of 15 FPS in high settings in the fast-paced racing game Asphalt 8 , the game remained playable. The shooter Dead Trigger 2 achieved its usual 30 FPS on the handset.. Control via touchscreen and position sensor functioned smoothly.. The casing temperatures of LG's Stylus 2 make for a rather pleasing chapter: The maximum temperature is 39.2 Â°C. That is a relatively low rate especially since this temperature is clearly limited to the back and decreases toward the lower edge. The front reaches a maximum of 36 Â°C, which is felt lightly, but not at all unpleasantly.. Thus, neither the GPU nor CPU has problems in maintaining their performance even after prolonged use. The same sequence is repeated 30 times in the battery test of GFXBench, and the frame rate is logged. LG's Stylus 2 only exhibits minor fluctuations here.. 37.3 °C 37.9 °C 37.5 °C. 38 °C 37.9 °C 37.5 °C. 37 °C 37.9 °C 36.3 °C.

The little rear-sided speaker manages a maximum of 88.12 dB(A). That is quite loud and is enough to fill small rooms with sound. The sound is relatively tinny in total, but it also displays a bit of warmth thanks to acceptably prominent mids. Low tones are actually non-existent, but the trebles are not overemphasized, either. Overall, the speaker is a bit more pleasing than some other smartphone speakers, but it cannot match premium-range models or even the speaker in OnePlus' 2. Sound output via audio jack and Bluetooth is clear.. Despite the large screen, LG's Stylus 2 is very frugal with energy in all scenarios. Asus' ZenFone Max is based on the same SOC and proves just how important it is for manufacturers to make optimizations: Asus' smartphone consumes considerably more power than our review sample.. Not only are the low consumption rates of LG's Stylus 2 in a shutdown and standby state pleasing but also the very low load consumption that is almost half of what other devices consume..

The low consumption rates already indicate that LG's Stylus 2 will keep up quite well in battery life. In fact, our review sample manages 11:03 hours in our practical Wi-Fi test on its battery with a capacity of 11.6 watt hours. That is a clear edge on review samples with an equally sized battery. The ZenFone Max achieves a few hours more thanks to its tremendously strong battery..

Review sample courtesy of LG Germany.. LG's Stylus 2 stands out from other mid-range devices with some innovative features. First to mention is the stylus that is actually only known from considerably higher priced devices. It allows making handwritten notes on the screen or cut objects out of photos accurately. Pressure levels are not supported, and (hobby) artists will not be happy with it.. The second feature is radio reception via DAB+. LG has come up with a real innovation and a great feature for Central Europe. Mobile Internet costs are now so low and access so far-reaching that most people do not use radio but stream in other regions of the world.. However, the reception was too weak indoors in a city in our test. Furthermore, it was only really reliable in conjunction with the included headset. The offer of radio stations is vast, but the network still has to be developed further and the advantages used more clearly before digital radio reception will be a real alternative.. LG's Stylus 2 is an innovative handset that displays cost pressure in some places. The stylus and DAB+ unfortunately also look cooler on paper than in real life.. Thus, neither of the features is uncompromisingly convincing, and some drawbacks will have to be accepted: The screen only has a resolution of 720p and is not really bright. Buyers looking for a handset with more power will find considerably better alternatives in this price range. The call quality is also sooner middling.. There are some positive aspects: We like the cameras' photos at least when shot in bright surroundings. The battery also lasts a long time thanks to low power consumption. The reception of the communication modules is decent, and LG also relies on a fairly up-to-date version of Android.. We barely had a situation where the name-giving stylus really made sense. However, anyone who has ever wanted a smartphone with a big screen and stylus for little money and is intending to try DAB+ reception should give LG's Stylus 2 a chance..

The LG Stylus 2 is actually the "enhanced sequel" to the G Stylo , which was also known as the LG G4 Stylus outside of the US and Korea, just in case you weren't confused enough already.. The handset measures 155 by 79.6mm by 7.4mm and weighs 145g (6.1 by 3.1 by 0.3 inches and 5.1 oz.).. Justin Yu /. While the 13-megapixel camera is a nice jump up from the 8-megapixel rear snapper on the Stylo, and the 20-gram (0.7-ounce) weight difference is significant, there don't seem to be too many other differences.. Justin Yu /. The battery size and storage are the same, and even the processor is still a 1.2GHz quad-core, although LG hasn't gone into any further specifics on that front.. Justin Yu /. There's 16GB of internal storage with additional support for a microSD card.. Justin Yu /. The phone has a slim profile that leaves just enough width for the new stylus.. Justin Yu /. The new stylus has a slightly mysterious "nano-coated" tip instead of the rubber one of the previous generation. According to LG, this is supposed to improve accuracy.. Justin Yu /. Removing the pen now automatically gets you a pop-up menu, a la the Samsung Note range.. There's also a new Calligraphy Font for people with great handwriting and a burning need to show it off on their phone.. Justin Yu /. The Pen Keeper is designed for the kind of people who constantly lose their keys. It gives you a warning if it detects the phone moving away when the pen bay is empty.. Justin Yu /. Like its curiously named predecessor, the Stylus 2 has a large 5.7-inch screen, but it sports a slimmer and lighter design. Click here to learn more about the Stylus 2 .. Justin Yu /.

Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. LG's Stylus 2 is the first phone to support DAB+ radio. It won't hit the US, but it will go on sale in Europe and Australia.. Despite the increase in streaming, smartphone makers have still seen it fit to include FM radio support in their devices, especially in emerging markets. The main reasons for this are that it saves data and it doesn't eat into battery life nearly as much as listening to something over the internet. With more consumers embracing digital, LG has seen it fit to outfit the Stylus 2 , a phone it first unveiled back in February, with something not seen before in modern mobile devices: DAB+ radio support.. DAB+ isn't a new standard, but uptake varies across the world. In the US, broadcasters have adopted the HD Radio standard , while DAB and DAB+ has been embraced across Europe. That explains why LG won't launch the Stylus 2 with DAB+ support in North America and is focusing on Australia, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway and the UK.. The phone features a big 5.7-inch 1280 x 720 display, quad-core 1.2 GHz processor, 1.5GB of RAM, 13-megapixel camera and a 3,000mAh battery. With its pointer, the Stylus 2 is a Galaxy Note competitor and comes with smart features to make the most of it. Pen Pop, for example, is a neat shortcut menu that houses Pop Memo and Pop Scanner apps, while Pen Keeper alerts you if it believes you've walked off with your phone but left the stylus behind.. While DAB encodes broadcasts in MPEG2 (or MP2), DAB+ uses aacPlus, which offers increased quality at small bitrates. The standards use the same transmitters, making it easy for companies to support both (and eventually phase DAB out). That means more high-quality broadcasts, but it will also allow stations to include radio playback alongside other online services inside their own apps.. av , DAB , DAB+ , gear , HDradio , lg , mobile , stylus2.

You’ve probably detected by now that I found the LG Stylus 2 to be a rather underwhelming experience in many ways. Perhaps that explains why I was quite impressed by its camera.. Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing outstanding about the Stylus 2’s camera specs or photographic performance. It’s the kind of 13-megapixel unit we’ve come to expect of most smartphones in 2016.. However, it managed to turn out some genuinely decent results. At its best, such as a when the auto-HDR mode kicked in effectively for a mid-evening landscape shot, or for a nicely bokeh-ed flower close-up, LG’s considerable camera expertise shines through. Such examples are a clear step above the many low-end pretenders.. It’s frustrating, then, when that auto-HDR inexplicably fails to kick in, leaving over-exposed skies or gloomy foregrounds.. Detail is nice from the 13MP camera. But you’ll struggle when the HDR doesn’t kick in properly. Overall, though, I was quite happy with the LG Stylus 2’s main camera. Its 8-megapixel front camera isn’t so hot, though.. This seems to be the same 8-megapixel camera that I’d previously experienced in the LG X Screen – another recent mid-ranger from the Korean manufacturer. For some reason, selfies with this unit turn out blurry and lacking in detail, despite the apparent megapixel bump.. You also have to contend with a tacky “beauty” slider that serves to remove your facial blemishes at the expense of your humanity. If you want to see what your eventual Android replacement will look like when the AI goes rogue, take a selfie with this hideous setting pushed up anywhere past the half-way mark.. Video extends only to 1080p Full HD – which, of course, you won’t be able to watch back in its native resolution on that 720p display. Nevertheless, t’s smooth and balanced enough.. As it turns out, I’ve saved the best part of the LG Stylus 2 for last. It seems to go on forever in between charges.. We’re looking at a 3,000mAh removable battery here, which is the kind of unit you expect to see in flagship phones with QHD displays and super-fast processors. With the Stylus 2’s 720p display and its modestly clocked Snapdragon 410 CPU, there evidently isn’t anything like the same power draw.. Related: Best phones to buy 2016. The result is that I found I could get through three full days of moderate usage before the battery warning kicked in at 15%. This involved employing my typical habit of putting the phone in Airplane mode overnight. During my waking hours I took several calls, indulged in several bouts of web browsing, did a spot of gaming, and took a dozen or so photos..

It’s a sterling performance, and the fact that the LG Stylus 2’s battery is replaceable will be the icing on the cake for frequent travellers.. With its underwhelming screen resolution, mediocre performance, and bland design, the LG Stylus 2 doesn’t make a strong case for consideration above current affordable champs such as the Moto G4. Indeed, with a launch price of around £250, it seems grossly overpriced.. The Stylus 2’s prospects aren’t massively enhanced by a competent if inessential digital pen system and curiously archaic DAB+ support. On the plus side, its main camera is capable of some decent (if far from spectacular) results, and its battery life is truly stellar.. Overall, the Stylus 2 needs to drop in price by a good £75 to £100 – and even then there are better options.. The LG Stylus 2 is an under-equipped, overpriced phablet that suffers in comparison to some much cheaper and only slightly smaller-screened devices..

Scribblers on the move will love LG's Stylus 2. After the launch of the X Cam and X Screen smartphones, the company has followed them up with the LG Stylus 2 , a big-screen device that comes with a stylus pen for serial note-takers, artists, and scribblers-on-the-move. Although it’s named the Stylus 2, it’s the sequel to the G4 Stylus/G Stylo from last year, a phone announced after the G4 was revealed. LG can’t very well name this new phone the G5 Stylus when it hasn’t revealed the G5 yet, can it.. The stylus hides away in a slot on the phone, but because it’s not tethered once removed, there’s always a chance of it being lost/forgotten/eaten by the dog. LG has come up with a solution to minimize the chances of misplacing the stylus with a feature called Pen Keeper. It knows when you pick up the phone and wander off, and will display a warning message on the screen if it detects the stylus slot is empty.. Removing the stylus activates a feature called Pen Pop, where a special shortcut menu appears on the display, showing apps and widgets that are compatible with the pen. LG has also added a new font for the stylus that imitates fountain pen calligraphy, and writing using it will be easier thanks to a more accurate nano-coated tip on the stylus, rather than the rubber tip used on the G4 Stylus pen.. Otherwise, the Stylus 2 is a simple update over the G4 Stylus. The screen still measures 5.7-inches and has a 720p resolution, and there’s a 1.2GHz quad-core chip inside the 145 gram phone. Memory has been increased to 1.5GB and storage to 16GB, plus there’s a MicroSD card slot, and a 3000mAh battery. The cameras have been improved, with a 13-megapixel camera on the back, and an 8-megapixel camera on the front.. LG will display the Stylus 2 at Mobile World Congress, and hasn’t revealed price or release information yet.
