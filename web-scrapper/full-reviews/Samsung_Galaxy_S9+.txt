If you're on the fence, wait. If you want the iPhone X's Face ID or animojis... Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus specs versus iPhone X and Google Pixel 2 XL. The Galaxy S9 takes the all-screen design to new heights.. A bold new camera, a state-of-the-art processor with an Android Oreo operating system and a fix to the Galaxy line's biggest design misstep -- all in a body that looks strikingly similar to last year's model.. That, in a nutshell, is the Samsung Galaxy S9 (5.8-inch screen) and its larger step-up model, the Galaxy S9 Plus. You can preorder them March 2 at prices starting from $720 in the US for the standard S9 and $870 for the S9 Plus, depending on your carrier .. The phones are unquestionably beautiful, but what do we get with these slightly curved, all-screen specimens?. On the surface, it looks as if Samsung has only incrementally refreshed last year's. Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ). But the 2018 models sport a serious camera upgrade that includes two lenses for the S9 Plus and a variable aperture for both phones that's designed to capture much better low-light shots. (I'll test the hell out of the cameras in my full review, coming soon.). Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus: Our first look. The second improvement is more of a fix. Samsung moved the fingerprint reader from the side of the rear camera to the center of the phone's back, fixing what was without a doubt the Galaxy S8's most maddening design flaw. Last year's model made you stretch your finger awkwardly to hit the fingerprint target. I also approve of the S9's headphone jack, a feature practically extinct on other high-end phones. And it's added enhanced stereo surround sound, enabled by the microphone doubling as a second speaker. inside promises at least 25 percent faster processing speeds than 2017 Android phones, as well as longer battery life. (Note, as per usual, that depending on your local region, you could have a Samsung Exynos 9810 processor instead.). I loved the wild card bursts of color in coral blue and lilac purple on the phone's body, which jolt the Galaxy line from its monochromatic stupor. (Yes, you can still get the S9s in sedate black or gray.) And the two phones keep tried-and-true high-end phone features such as waterproofing (rated IP68) , wireless charging and support for external microSD storage.. So, yeah: All the good stuff you'd expect is here, which is why I walked away from my Galaxy S9 hands-on time feeling great about these two phones. That said, I felt that Samsung fell flat when it came to countering the two big features of its archrival, the. iPhone X ( $1,099.99 at Best Buy ). The Galaxy S9's Intelligent Scan unlock option doesn't measure up to Apple's Face ID, and Samsung's AR Emoji feature lacks the charm and verve of iPhone's animojis -- they came off as eerie and unfinished. This rivalry with iPhone features is important because Samsung's marquee handsets stand in direct competition to the iPhone X ,. In a landscape where premium phones are more similar than they are different, Samsung has struggled to capture the same cultural zeitgeist as the iPhone, or introduce headline-grabbing innovations like Apple's Face ID and gestural navigation. That nifty in-screen fingerprint reader would've been just the ticket, but it's MIA here.. Will the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus stand up to the iPhone X,.

Apart from their size, the biggest difference between the S9 and S9 Plus is the presence of a second lens on the back of the Plus.. This second lens, a telephoto, is dedicated to creating those depth-of-field portrait shots that blur the background to make people and objects pop. This is Samsung's second phone to catch the trend, after last August's Galaxy Note 8 ( $900.00 at Amazon.com ) .. The Galaxy S9 borrows heavily from core S8 features and design, often making fractional adjustments or generational improvements rather than enormous overhauls. That's not bad per se, especially when the S8 was so good overall.. The Galaxy S9, left, moves the fingerprint reader below the camera -- much better than the placement on the Note 8, right, and S8.. For example, the battery capacities remain the same as last year's models, but the new Snapdragon 845 chipset promises to eke out a little more battery life by being more efficient overall. Also, while the camera megapixels hold steady at 12 for the rear and 8-megapixels for the front, respectively, additional features and underlying improvements claim to boost photo quality.. While the Galaxy S9's camera megapixels hold steady, the camera itself is bundled with new features. The coolest is the mechanical aperture that automatically switches between two aperture settings -- F2.4 for daylight and F1.5 for low light -- to give you better low light shots.. The S9 and S9 Plus want to up the game on low light photos.. This part bears repeating: The aperture is mechanical, you can watch it physically move from one setting to another, a change you can see with your naked eye. This feature, previously only seen in DSLR cameras, kicks in automatically, but you can also manually select an aperture in the pro camera settings. We're all excited to see how this plays out against the iPhone X and the Google Pixel 2, our current low-light champ.. The rear cameras continue to support OIS, or optical image stabilization, which helps reduce blur and shake in photos and videos.. Samsung Galaxy S9's new cameras have a bunch of new tricks. Two cameras helps achieve the depth of field needed for portrait shots, but background blur can also occur through a single lens and software, like on the Pixel 2 phones. As with the iPhone X, the Galaxy S9 phones introduce a portrait mode for the front-facing camera. You find it in the camera settings.. The new "selfie focus" mode blurs your background to emphasize your face.. The videographer for my friend's wedding once said "slow motion is emotion". The adage stuck with me, and it's what makes the Galaxy S9's use of super slow-motion video work.. The Galaxy S8's slow-mo video topped out at 720 fps (frames per second) in HD quality, but the S9 shoots at a peak of 960 fps, which really stretches out those frames. So 0.2 recorded seconds becomes 6 seconds of playback.. Note that the entire video won't run in slow motion. It'll start and end at the usual 30 fps, with the extraaa-slowww footage in between. You can set this yourself manually or let the program pick for you.. Once your (MP4) video is set in stone, the S9 will also create an animated GIF that you can share over any messaging app. You can loop it, reverse the order of the action and set the slow-motion GIF as your wallpaper.. pioneered this level of slow-mo back in 2017.. A new tool inside the camera says it'll calorie-count your food.. Bixby Vision is a tool that lives inside the camera app. You can tap the eye icon to bring it up. It handles translations, shopping and other tools through optical image recognition.. Samsung adds a calorie calculator in Bixby Vision (yes, you go through the motions to take a photo of your meal, and it estimates the calorie count), as well as a makeup app that superimposes new makeup colors and looks over your face. Sephora and Cover Girl are the first partners.. Some additional work under the hood means that photos should have up to 30 percent less image noise, meaning they'll look clearer when you blow them up or zoom in tight. This is because the camera has its own memory, called DRAM, which works four times faster to select the best images from multiple shots. DRAM is also what helps make super slow-motion video possible.. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus cameras: Everything you need to know. The iPhone X hooked phone owners on the idea of turning their faces into animated emojis of bunnies, robots and, yes, poop.. This is me, apparently, thinking really hard about AR Emoji.. Samsung's response is AR Emoji, a feature that scans your unsmiling face to set up a library of 18 stickers you can use to express yourself in messaging apps or any platform that works with the animated GIF format. It's a bit like Bitmoji and lets you customize your avatar's hair and clothes.. You can also record a video message of yourself, either as a human avatar or as a nonhuman, so you could be a rabbit or a Disney character. You swipe from the camera interface to get started, but Samsung also plans to open the feature up to third-party apps. The emoji saves as an MP4 video file.. So far, six CNET editors have tried it out, and the experience was definitely subpar. AR Emoji need to be much more nuanced to feel like "you," and they need to track your smile. The avatars didn't match our skin and hair tones, and were unable to naturally smile when we did. Samsung adapted the iPhone X's face unlock tool and animated emoji messages, and stumbled both times.. Samsung's answer to Face ID doesn't map your face with tens of thousands of infrared dots like the iPhone X does. It combines two previous Galaxy S8 unlock mechanisms into one: iris scanning, which is secure, and face unlock, which isn't.. The idea is that the S9 tries to unlock the phone with your eyes first. If that fails, because you're wearing the wrong kind of sunglasses or the scene is too dark, Intelligent Scan will immediately fall back to face unlock, which will be fast and convenient.. Your fingerprint and iris are still the most secure ways to unlock your phone.. The problem is that face unlock isn't secure, which means that you can't count on Intelligent Scan to be secure all the time, or keep other faces from unlocking your phone.. I just don't get the point of promoting insecure access. You're better off sticking with the fingerprint reader and iris scanner.. DeX is Samsung's platform for turning a Galaxy phone into a desktop experience. You dock the phone and see the contents on a larger screen.. Samsung DeX Pad turns the Galaxy S9 into a touchpad PC. It's mostly aimed at business cases, as in banks and hotels that could benefit from showing customers the same canned presentations on a smaller device and on a larger screen. Imagine a timeshare presentation, for example, or some mortgage options.. The DeX Pad , the newest iteration, one-ups last year's DeX dock ( $122.59 at Amazon.com ) by laying the phone flat. You still plug it in through a USB-C jack, but the new arrangement exposes the phone's headset jack so that's accessible if you're gaming.. The new DeX Pad design also lets you use the screen as a touchpad and digital keyboard, instead of a mouse and physical keyboard. You can adjust the resolution and sensitivity. The DeX Pad is also compatible with the Galaxy S8, S8 Plus and Note 8.. My hands-on time with the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus was long enough to get a sense of the new features, but not long enough to thoroughly test either device. I don't have a final opinion on the S9, but I do have some general suggestions.. You'll see the most speed, design and camera improvements if you're upgrading from a 2016 phone or earlier -- especially if you're dying to taking portrait photos. In that case, the larger S9 Plus is your best bet. If you can live without portrait pics, the S9 is a smaller device that will also save you a little cash over the Plus model.. If you're not in dire need of a new phone the moment the S9s become available, wait for my full review to see which cons you can live with and which pros you can't live without.. It's not looking like the S9 phones will cut it. Samsung's AR Emoji and Intelligent Scan clearly need work. But if neither of those features do it for you, no matter. They amount to tiny additions that will be easy to ignore and shouldn't make much difference in day-to-day use..

Samsung's new super phones get variable aperture cameras and fix their fingerprint reader flaw for 2018. But they keep a familiar look and feel.. by February 25, 2018 9:00 AM PST. Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus price and sale date. Galaxy S9 versus S9 Plus: What's the difference?.

The big deal with the new camera: Mechanical aperture, portrait selfies, slo-mo video. Bixby Vision can apply makeup and count calories. AR Emoji needs more work to be less creepy. Intelligent Scan is like a less secure Face ID. What's the DeX Pad and will I need it?. So should I preorder the Galaxy S9 or what?. Preorder if you're a Samsung fan with an older phone. If you're on the fence, wait. If you want the iPhone X's Face ID or animojis... Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus specs versus iPhone X and Google Pixel 2 XL. The Galaxy S9 takes the all-screen design to new heights.. A bold new camera, a state-of-the-art processor with an Android Oreo operating system and a fix to the Galaxy line's biggest design misstep -- all in a body that looks strikingly similar to last year's model.. That, in a nutshell, is the Samsung Galaxy S9 (5.8-inch screen) and its larger step-up model, the Galaxy S9 Plus. You can preorder them March 2 at prices starting from $720 in the US for the standard S9 and $870 for the S9 Plus, depending on your carrier .. The phones are unquestionably beautiful, but what do we get with these slightly curved, all-screen specimens?. On the surface, it looks as if Samsung has only incrementally refreshed last year's. Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ). But the 2018 models sport a serious camera upgrade that includes two lenses for the S9 Plus and a variable aperture for both phones that's designed to capture much better low-light shots. (I'll test the hell out of the cameras in my full review, coming soon.). Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus: Our first look. The second improvement is more of a fix. Samsung moved the fingerprint reader from the side of the rear camera to the center of the phone's back, fixing what was without a doubt the Galaxy S8's most maddening design flaw. Last year's model made you stretch your finger awkwardly to hit the fingerprint target. I also approve of the S9's headphone jack, a feature practically extinct on other high-end phones. And it's added enhanced stereo surround sound, enabled by the microphone doubling as a second speaker. inside promises at least 25 percent faster processing speeds than 2017 Android phones, as well as longer battery life. (Note, as per usual, that depending on your local region, you could have a Samsung Exynos 9810 processor instead.). I loved the wild card bursts of color in coral blue and lilac purple on the phone's body, which jolt the Galaxy line from its monochromatic stupor. (Yes, you can still get the S9s in sedate black or gray.) And the two phones keep tried-and-true high-end phone features such as waterproofing (rated IP68) , wireless charging and support for external microSD storage.. So, yeah: All the good stuff you'd expect is here, which is why I walked away from my Galaxy S9 hands-on time feeling great about these two phones. That said, I felt that Samsung fell flat when it came to countering the two big features of its archrival, the. iPhone X ( $1,099.99 at Best Buy ). The Galaxy S9's Intelligent Scan unlock option doesn't measure up to Apple's Face ID, and Samsung's AR Emoji feature lacks the charm and verve of iPhone's animojis -- they came off as eerie and unfinished. This rivalry with iPhone features is important because Samsung's marquee handsets stand in direct competition to the iPhone X ,. In a landscape where premium phones are more similar than they are different, Samsung has struggled to capture the same cultural zeitgeist as the iPhone, or introduce headline-grabbing innovations like Apple's Face ID and gestural navigation. That nifty in-screen fingerprint reader would've been just the ticket, but it's MIA here.. Will the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus stand up to the iPhone X,. Google Pixel 2 ( $639.99 at Amazon Marketplace ). and others? Are they worth an upgrade from the Galaxy S8 and older phones? Keep reading for price, preorder and sale dates, and all the details.. Preorders begin March 2 and the phones go on sale March 16, for more than last year's S8 and S8 Plus -- that's the dual-aperture camera tech talking. Carriers and retailers will announce local prices.. For example, we know that the S9 goes for between $720 and $800 in the US, with the S9 Plus ringing in for between $840 and $930.. The S9 and S9 Plus cost a little more than last year's models.. In the UK, you're looking at £739 for the S9 and £869 for the S9 Plus from Samsung's website. In Australia the S9 starts at AU$1,199, with the S9 Plus starting at AU$1,349. One thing you should know is that Samsung wants to drum up upgrades by launching a global program called Trade Up and Save. Basically, the company will give you credit for turning in your old phone and buying a new Galaxy. In the US, you can earn up to $350, but it will vary by country.. Samsung's program is separate than trade-in programs from your carrier and other big box stores and websites.. The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus will sell in lilac purple, coral blue, midnight black and titanium gray, but not every country will get every color.

Samsung Galaxy S9 is all about the camera. @kyurieff February 25, 2018: 12:08 PM ET. Samsung just added major fuel to the ongoing battle for the best smartphone camera.. The South Korean tech giant on Sunday unveiled the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the world's largest phone show.. While the phones are about the same size as the previous versions, the Galaxy S8 and S8+, the screens are brighter and slightly bigger. They have an advanced camera and stereo speakers, along with fun new tools, such as AR emoji, photo language translation and improved slow-motion video.. "Consumers are expressing themselves more," Suzanne De Silva, Samsung director of product strategy and marketing, said at a media event in New York ahead of the launch.. "We don't really call each other as much as we text, and that text has gotten richer. We're adding images and emojis [to everything]," she said.. Related: Samsung is cashing in on bitcoin mining. Like other Samsung Galaxy phones, the S9 is water resistant and touts an infinity display, wireless charging, and a headphone jack. It also features enhanced facial recognition to better compete with the iPhone X.. The device will initially be available in black, blue, and purple, with a gray option coming later.. Pre-orders start on Friday March 2, and the new phones will be available in stores on March 16. The S9 costs $720 for an unlocked device, while the S9+ is available for $840.. Although the Samsung Galaxy S9 builds on where the Galaxy S8 left off, does it have enough wow factor?. It's certainly not a revolutionary model, but fans may be convinced to upgrade for the camera, better audio for video streaming, and other unique features like ultra-slow motion video.. The brightest spot of Samsung devices has long been its camera. Its latest smartphone is no exception.. The new camera can take sharper photos in challenging lighting conditions than previous models. It has a dual camera and a new dual aperture that works like a human eye to adjust to bright or dark lighting. It makes sure photos are crisp and clear even in difficult lighting, and the aperture can switch between F2.4 and F1.5 to let in more or less light.. A fun slow-motion tool lets users take videos that are 32 times slower than traditional video. This can give you quirky, shareable shots that the phone automatically matches with music. For example, when someone throws confetti in slow motion, the phone pairs the video with upbeat music. (The music can be changed if Samsung misses the mark).. In a bid to take on one of the buzziest new iOS features, Animoji , Samsung's new AR emoji mirror your facial expressions. But the difference is that Samsung's version turns you into a cartoon based on a selfie, similar to the concept behind Snapchat's popular Bitmoji app .. You can customize features like hair and clothing, and add accessories like glasses. They'll appear in 18 pre-set GIFs attached to your keyboard. Users can turn themselves into characters like a bunny or cat, too.. While the personalized AR emoji feature does a solid job of mimicking, the bunny or cat characters were less accurate and expressive during our tests.. The S9 also has a useful live language translation feature that lets scan objects like a sign or a menu. While the tool is virtually the same as an existing feature on Google Translate's app, adding it to Samsung's camera could lead to wider consumer use.. You can hold the camera up to an object and get a fast translation. But the coolest part about it is that it's not giving you subtitles. It overlays the object and virtually deletes the original text, replacing it with your native language via Google Translate. Although Samsung has offered facial recognition on its Galaxy devices for a while, it's ramping up its efforts even more to compete with the iPhone X's new Face ID feature.. Its new "intelligent scan" tool blends its facial recognition and iris scanner. Depending on the lighting, the tool determines whether to unlock the phone with its iris scanner or facial recognition. The iris scanner, which allows you to open the phone with your eyes, has had challenges working in direct sunlight.. It will be easy for the Samsung Galaxy S9 to stand out at the mobile conference in Spain this week because other major smartphone brands such as Huawei and LG are not expected to launch new flagship phones, according to Thomas Husson, vice president at research firm Forrester.. "Samsung has a great marketing window of opportunity to claim innovation leadership on the high-end smartphone segment," he said.. Here's what could bring it down to earth. Samsung ( SSNLF ) has surpassed a number of challenges in the past year and a half, including faulty batteries in its Galaxy Note 7 phones and Lee Jae-yong, the company's de facto leader, being found guilty of bribery and other corruption charges. Nevertheless, the company has reported record earnings of $50 billion in 2017. It's also the world's largest smartphone manufacturer and chipmaker.. "The Note 7 debacle seems to be firmly behind it," said David McQueen, research director of consumer devices and strategic technology at ABI Research. "This doesn't seem to have damaged the brand.".

Want to learn more? Start here.. What are the big changes over the S8 series?. The first place you're going to want to start is with our preview , which gives you everything you need to know about Samsung's latest phones.. Samsung has kept the primary sensor at 12 megapixels, but that's where the similarities end. The S9 and S9+ have adjustable apertures, switching seamlessly between f/1.5 and f/2.4. The Galaxy S9+ also gets a second 12MP sensor with a "telephoto" lens that provides 2x lossless zoom, and facilitates Live Focus, Samsung's version of portrait mode that debuted with the Galaxy Note 8.. In terms of specs, the Galaxy S9+ has an extra two gigabytes of RAM over the regular S9, which is different from last year's models. And, obviously, the fingerprint sensors have been relocated to a much more sensible place on the back of the phone — below the now-vertical camera modules.. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ specs.

The Samsung Galaxy S9 is finally here: Here’s everything you need to know. Arguably the most highly-anticipated Android phones for the year are finally here. Samsung on Sunday announced the Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy S9 Plus at Mobile World Congress, both of which feature a beautiful edge-to-edge design, a revamped camera, and the latest and greatest Qualcomm processor.. Here’s everything you need to know. You can check out our Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus hands-on review for a more in-depth analysis.. At a first glance, you might find it a little hard to tell the Galaxy S9 apart from its predecessor, the Galaxy S8. It’s got the same Super AMOLED Infinity Display, including the same Quad HD+ resolution, and the same display size — 5.8-inches on the Galaxy S9 and 6.2-inches on the Galaxy S9 Plus. Upon closer inspection, however, you can see some subtle differences — like the fact that the bezels are slightly smaller, and that the fingerprint sensor on the back has been repositioned to be more accessible.. You also still get a Bixby button on the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. Now, the Bixby button has been a little controversial considering you can’t reprogram it, but Samsung promises that it has been working to make Bixby better. We’ll have to test the phone to see if that’s true.. The phones may not be all that different from the Galaxy S8, but they’re still attractive, and now refined. If you were hoping for a major redesign, perhaps hold out for next year’s Galaxy S10, or even the flexible phone Samsung expects to release in 2019.. You’ll find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor. powering both Galaxy S9 devices, but apart from the newer and more powerful processor, the specifications are practically the same as the Galaxy S8. The Galaxy S9 features 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage, while the Galaxy S9 Plus offers 6GB of RAM with the same 64GB of storage. Both devices offer a MicroSD card slot, so you can expand upon that storage if you so choose.. When it comes to battery, it’s again more of the same. Like last year, the standard-sized phone features a 3,000mAh battery, while the larger Galaxy S9 Plus boasts a 3,500mAh battery. The phones utilize Qualcomm’s QuickCharge 2.0, and can charge wirelessly.. The second biggest improvement to the Galaxy S9 over the S8 is audio. Samsung enlisted the help of Harmon’s AKG, which is under the Samsung brand, for both the stereo speakers and the included earbuds. The S9 doesn’t have dual front-facing speakers — rather, the bottom-firing speaker works in tandem with the earpiece at the top of the phone for stereo sound. The speakers support Dolby Atmos technology for even more spatial sound.. The first biggest improvement to the S9, is the camera.. Samsung is putting a lot of its marketing budget in. advertising the Galaxy S9’s camera, and for good reason — it represents the biggest upgrade to the phone. Like the Galaxy Note 8, the Galaxy S9 Plus has dual cameras. But it’s the main camera on both the S9 and the S9 Plus that’s more interesting.. The main sensor, which packs 12-megapixels, doesn’t have a fixed aperture. It’s a mechanical lens, so its aperture swaps from f/1.5 at night, which the lowest-ever aperture on a phone, all the way up to f/2.4 during the day. The camera will switch aperture automatically depending on the time of day, but you can also change it yourself manually in the manual camera mode. The f/1.5 lens will help with low-light photography, but it’s unclear what the immediate benefit is of using a second aperture for day time photos.. Samsung said it also improved its image processing software. A tap of the shutter icon now captures more photos, and Samsung’s algorithms are capable of reducing a lot of noise or graininess in low-light photos. Overall, the Galaxy S9 should easily be the best smartphone camera for low-light photography, but we’ll need to try it out to back that claim.. The second camera on the Galaxy S9 Plus is also a 12-megapixel lens, but it offers 2x optical zoom, allowing you to take photos of objects further away. It’s also utilized for features like the blur mode that Samsung calls “Live Focus,” which debuted on the Note 8. If you opt for the standard Galaxy S9, you unfortunately won’t get that second lens and these features.. Samsung also seems to have taken a page out of Sony’s book — the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus can both shoot slow-motion video up to a hefty 960 frames per second, though the resolution is limited to 720p. It can predict the moment you’ll want to have slowed down, and artificial intelligence will pair a generic music track based on the mood of the video. You can then easily share these videos as GIF files in three different styles: Loop, Reverse, and Swing.. As you might have expected, Samsung is also following Apple’s lead with Animoji. Samsung’s take on the feature is called AR Emoji, and it basically allows your face to turn into moving, animated characters through the front-facing camera. Samsung has even partnered with Disney on the feature — and as such you’ll get a slew of Disney characters to use. You can create your own AR Emoji, and these will also be generated as an animated sticker pack for you to use in your messaging apps.. Last but not least, there indeed are some additions to Bixby, specifically Bixby Vision. The camera in Bixby now offers things like live translation,. real-time currency conversion, and the ability to try makeup on your face (after which you can purchase that makeup through Sephora or Cover Girl). You can even point the camera at food and have Samsung estimate how many calories it has — which can then be ported into S-Health.. Here’s the most important part, and it’s actually good news. Despite rumors that the phones would increase in price, you’ll be able to pick up the Galaxy S9 from Samsung for a cool $719.99, or $30 a month for 24 months. If you’re wanting to pick up the larger S9 Plus, than that can be yours with prices starting from $839.99, or $35 a month for 24 months. The phones will go up for pre-order on March 2 in Lilac Purple, Coral Blue, and Midnight Black. In the U.S., the devices will go on sale on March 16.. If you’re upgrading from an older Galaxy device, Samsung is also offering a trade-in program that could net you up to $350 off a new S9 or S9 Plus.. Here’s how to buy the brand-new Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus. Buying a Galaxy S9? Here’s how to sell your old Galaxy phone. Here are five features we’d like to see on the Samsung Galaxy S9.

Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus are here: The best just got better. by Team AA 16 hours ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Differences in more than just display size. The fingerprint sensor is where it should be. Cameras with dual apertures and 960 fps automatic slow-mo. Apple has Animoji, Samsung has AR Emoji. Iris Scanner + Face Unlock = Intelligent Scan. It’s launching with a new DeX Pad. Both phones are launching March 16. After the success of the Galaxy S8 and Note 8 , Samsung once again finds itself holding the top spot as the biggest Android OEM in the world. But it’s not just trying to keep its die-hard Galaxy fans coming back â it’s also trying to court as many iPhone users as possible.. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus Â. The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus are all about refinement. Design, display, photography, and performance were all strong areas for the Galaxy S8 line, and the S9 does all of them better.. Here’s what you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus.. Samsung is changing the tiers of its Galaxy lineup to be more akin to Apple’s iPhones. In the past, Galaxy S phones launched at the same time would offer similar specifications, only differing in screen size and battery capacity. The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus have a few more differences , however.. The most obvious difference here are the display sizes. The Galaxy S9 has a 5.8-inch Quad HD+ Curved Super AMOLED display with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, resulting in a pixel density of 570 ppi. The S9 Plus has the same style of display and aspect ratio, but measures 6.2 inches. Samsung says these displays are also 15 percent brighter than the Galaxy S8.. Don’t miss: The full list of Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 specs. The Galaxy S9 Plus is also the more powerful option. While the S8 and S8 Plus came with basically the same internals, the S9 sports 4 GB of RAM while the S9 bumps it up to 6 GB.. But the biggest difference between the two phones are the camera setups. The Galaxy S9 sports a single Dual Pixel 12 MP sensor with dual /1.5 and f/2.4 apertures. The S9 Plus offers two rear-facing camera sensors â one wide-angle at 12 MP and one telephoto at 12 MP. We’ll go into more detail on this later.. For those of you hoping for a drastic change in design this time around, move along â these aren’t the phones you’re looking for. Samsung says the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus had one of the most popular designs the company ever produced, so this year is all about refinement.. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” â A Samsung exec, probably. The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus sport the same form factor as the S8 line, but they’re smaller overall. That was accomplished by reducing the height of the S9 lineup and shrinking the top and bottom bezels. The S9 is about 1.2 mm shorter than the S8 and the S9 Plus is roughly 1.4 mm shorter than the S8 Plus.. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus color comparison. The Galaxy S8’s and Note 8’s fingerprint sensors were in the worst locations imaginable â to the right of the rear-facing camera sensor. For a super-tall phone, that meant using it basically required shifting your hand if you ever wanted to use it.. Now the fingerprint sensor is right under the single or dual camera, right where your finger naturally rests when holding the phone.. While the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus only offered minor improvements over their predecessors, the Galaxy S9 is a different story. The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus offer dual apertures in the same sensor.. While the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus only offered minor improvements over their predecessors, the Galaxy S9 is a different story.. Samsung says the lens functions similarly to the human eye â when you’re taking photos in sunlight, the lens will contract and let less light in. If you’re in a dark room, the lens opens and lets more light in. In bright lighting conditions, the S9’s camera will use the tighter f/2.4 aperture, while dark lighting conditions will result in the camera using the wider f/1.5 aperture.. Because the aperture is hardware based, you aren’t able to pick which aperture you’d like to use â you only get f/2.4 or f/1.5. You can choose one or the other in pro mode, but the device will pick for you in automatic mode.. Best of Android 2017: Which camera IS the best?. One of the most important areas for every smartphone is how good its camera is, but there are two ways to judge a camera: by whether it is technically good, or whether it looks good. Samsung has also included a new Image Sensor Processor in the S9 lineup that helps process multi-frame images to aid noise reduction. It works by processing photos in groups multiple times until to create what it thinks is the best photo. The whole process happens in the background, too, so it shouldn’t slow down actually taking photos. In fact, the Image Sensor Processor has its own DRAM to handle all the processing.. The inclusion of a dedicated image processor means the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus are also able to supportÂ. 960 fps slow motion at 720p. Samsung has included an automatic slow-mo feature in the camera app, so you’ll never have to think about when you should be recording â as long as you’re recording, the S9 will capture the slow-mo clips for you.. Once it automatically records these clips, it’ll save the video and shareable GIFs with effects with looping and reversing effects. You can even set these GIFs as your wallpaper.. Samsung is also launching its own version of Apple’s Animoji , called AR Emoji.. There are two different styles of AR Emoji â a cartoon-like emoji, similar to Animoji, or a more life-like one based on a photo of you or a friend. If you decide to go the lifelike route, just snap a photo and the Galaxy S9 will allow you to customize the hair, skin tone, clothes, and even accessories.. Once you’re done customizing, you can save your AR Emoji to your gallery in the form of GIFs, or add them as shortcuts to your keyboard to share quickly with friends.. For many Galaxy owners, Bixby leaves a lot to be desired. From the botched rollout in the U.S. to the hardware button you couldn’t disable , Samsung certainly needs to improve its smart assistant’s public perception.. With the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus, Bixby is making the camera smarter by offering live language translation. When the camera app is open and pointing at a piece of text, S9 users can simply tap the Bixby button, and the assistant will translate the text in real time. The translated text appears as an AR overlay, and actually worked really well in our demonstration.. Bixby can also now give you nutritional information on food. Want to know how many calories are in that donut? Point your camera at the donut, press the Bixby button, and the digital assistant will give you nutrition facts. (Pro tip: try to stay away from checking the calories on your donut. Finally, there’s a new mode that lets you overlay makeup from Sephora or Cover Girl to see how it looks before you buy it.. With the Galaxy S9 line, Samsung is combining two of its biometric security methods into one cohesive package. Intelligent Scan leverages both iris scanning and face unlock to offer a more secure, reliable way to unlock your smartphone.. Intelligent scan will leverage both unlock methods for different scenarios. It defaults to iris scanning as the primary unlock method for applications requiring a higher level of security, like banking apps or Samsung Pay. For most other conditions, it’ll use face unlock.. Previously, iris scanning on Galaxy phones was super secure, though often unreliable in bright lighting conditions. Face unlock, on the other hand, would have trouble recognizing the user’s face if it was too dark. Intelligent Scan should help users receive less errors when unlocking their phones.. After years of tinny, bottom-firing speakers, Samsung has finally decided to focus on audio. The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus still have a bottom-firing speaker, but now also have a forward-firing speaker on the top of the device.. After years of tinny, bottom-firing speakers, Samsung has finally decided to focus on audio.. Samsung says these stereo speakers are 1.4 times louder than the speakers on the S8 and S8 Plus. The improvements this year come from two different partnerships â AKG , the Samsung-owned company that tuned the speakers, and Dolby, whoseÂ. Dolby Atmos codec is built into the devices for better audio when using headphones.. Now when you’re playing games or watching YouTube videos, you won’t have such a hard time keeping your hand from muting the audio on accident.. Samsung launched the DeX alongside the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, allowing users to place their phones in the connected dock to power a monitor, mouse, and keyboard.Â. It was a great concept, but it meant users had to carry around a mouse and keyboard if they wanted to travel with it.. Samsung DeX review – can your smartphone replace a PC?. Alongside its new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 PlusÂ. smartphones, Samsung also unwrapped a new docking accessory designed to harness the power of the Galaxy S8. Called Samsung DeX, itâs meant to allow you to use â¦. This year, Samsung is improving on its original DeX design with the DeX Pad. Now all you need to do is place your phone on the DeX Pad, and you’ll be able to use your phone’s touchscreen as a keyboard and mouse, all while displaying your phone’s interface on your monitor.. The best part? It already works with every app installed on your phone. Samsung says it’s worked with a number of different app developers to optimize apps for the DeX Pad, and any developer can code for DeX using the SDK. Samsung has partnered with Square Enix to optimize Final Fantasy IV to work with a keyboard and mouse, too. You can start the game on your smartphone, then dock your phone on the DeX Pad to continue playing on a bigger display.. For those who’d rather use a physical keyboard and mouse, fear not â Samsung says the original DeX dock is sticking around. The DeX Pad is just another option for users who don’t want to carry those extra things around.. You’ll be able to get your hands on these bad boys in-store March 16, and pre-orders start March 2.. Samsung is holding its first-ever global pre-order promotion for the phones, called Trade Up and Save. The promotion allows customers to trade in their old smartphones for credit towards a new Galaxy S9 or S9 Plus. For phones that are a year old (like the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus), you’ll get up to $350 towards your purchase.

This offer is also available to users switching to the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus from non-Samsung flagships.

The South Korean Giant is one the largest supplier and manufacturer of Smartphone in the market. They have a huge share of the device carried by the generation in their hands. Now, they are coming with the new concept of flagship #Galaxy S9 #wannabe #2018. The device will be the wannabe of the year 2018.. The Samsung Galaxy S series has been around in the mobile phone market for quite some time now. The series has established itself as the godfather of mobile flagships with multiple upgrades each time a new device from the series is released. The series follows the trend if providing its users a high-end experience with various innovations and latest functions compacted in the hardware.. Samsung recently released their latest flagship device the Samsung Galaxy S8. The Galaxy S8 was only announced in March 2017 and is now available in stores for a price of $720 as of April 2017. The device is yet to reach out to the local stores worldwide. But, surprisingly, various reports have already claimed rumors to its successor the Samsung Galaxy S9.. Spreading of rumors certainly does not take a lot of time certainly if a brand like Samsung is involved. But no one expected the rumors of the Samsung Galaxy S9 to hit the market so quickly. There are various factors which come into play before the rumors of any device roll out. However, the geeks have found out a workaround for all of those with their research. In fact, even the price of Samsung Galaxy S9 has been estimated already. Why Samsung started working on Galaxy S9 too early? Features of Samsung Galaxy S9 What are the expectations from Galaxy S9? What is the release date of Samsung Galaxy S9? Difference between Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus Samsung Galaxy S9 Price Samsung Galaxy S9 Updates!. It’s not the first time to observe the spreading of rumors of any device. The reason why rumors spread so easily is the fans itself. Fans keep expecting new features and up gradation in the technology all the time. Designers make a concept which is new and acceptable by the public. It’s never been confirmed by Samsung that they have started working on the device or not. It is the designers and online news maker who spread the rumors.. Samsung has always been known to go neck and neck with their competitors in all ranges. The Galaxy S series is known to provide features of the latest and highest quality to its users. Samsung Galaxy S9 is expected to do the same. Here are the expected features of the Galaxy S9.. Display: The Galaxy S9 is expected to come with a 5.8’’ 4K Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen display with a pixel density of 570. Its display is also expected to come with a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection and resolutions of 2960X1440.. A dual micro SIM slot along with 4G LTE capabilities, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are confirmed in the device as they are standard utilities.. Camera: Samsung focuses on this department every year. The next version of the S series is expected to boast a 21 MP primary rear camera along with flash and a 13MP secondary camera up front with flash.. It is expected to be running on 7nm Chipset technology Octa core Snapdragon processor. 7nm Technology is aligned to come up in the same year.. 6GB of RAM, 128GB of ROM and an expandable memory of 256GB is also expected.. Operating system: It is expected to run on the next version of Android, the Android O.. Other features: Super Capacitor battery will be used for fast charging.. As good as the Samsung Galaxy S series is, people, do not see it as an investment worth making. A cheaper variant, however, seems like the ideal fix to this problem. The people want a cheaper variant of the Samsung Galaxy S9.. This seems like too much to ask for right now. However, people from around the world have requested various reputed brands to release a smart phone with a foldable screen. Smart phones with foldable screens were recently pictured in Asia. This gave rise to the people’s demand to see the feature in Samsung’s next flagship.. The improvements made on the camera of the Galaxy S8 disappointed a few people. People expected a large megapixel figure with a dual lens camera. However, due to the lack of time, Samsung could only provide a 12MP camera with single lens. Hopefully, the S9 wouldn’t face the same problem.. Samsung Galaxy S8 was released with many upgrades to its predecessor. However, its battery size compared to its other features faded its value. A 3000 mAh is something which would hold back the people from buying the device. We expect Samsung to work on this and increase the battery size to at least 4000 mAh.. As per the rumors spreading online by the news maker and designers make it clears that the device will be available in 2018. Even if we go with the common sense and previous release dates of the devices in the series; it can easily be assumed that Galaxy S9 will be launched at MWC, 2018. Just after its release, it will be available in Market from April, 2018.. It is believed that the Plus model will be the one with screen size of 6.5” with the same technical specs as of its main model.. As per our information, the main model will not be featuring 7nm technology and Super Capacitor Battery. Plus model will be the one to be featuring 7nm chipset technology ad Super Capacitor Battery.. Because of the more up gradation, Plus model will be release around one and half month later than Galaxy S9.. Price of Plus model can’t be spread straight forward with the wrong intention of rumors. As it will be featuring some latest technical upgrades; it is expected to be launched at a higher price.. While buying any product, the first thing which comes to our minds is the pricing of the product. Samsung Galaxy S9 Price lives with the same case. Its predecessor device (Samsung Galaxy S8) came with a starting price tag of $725 of its base version. On the other hand, the Galaxy S8 Plus was released with a tag of $825.. The expected price of any flagship device today is usually more than its predecessor. This is what the basic business mind thinks. The same is the case with the Samsung Galaxy S9 price. Similar to its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S9 price is also expected to be launched at $900 in US. We don’t expect the device to be any cheaper with the features that are rumored in the market.. A lot of upgrades are expected in Samsung Galaxy S9 when compared to its predecessor. An increase in camera quality, device RAM, display resolutions, battery size and much more are expected from the next flagship. However, the size of the screen (5.8” on the Samsung Galaxy S8) is expected to drop down in the next variant of the series. A change in placement of fingerprint sensor, a thinner body, and other hardware feature upgrades are also expected. With all these upgrades Samsung Galaxy S9 Price is expected to be much more than the S8 ($720 base).. Samsung Galaxy S9 has skyrocketed the consumers’ expectations with its rumored features and pricing. This should alert all of its competitors. However, judging the mobile phone already would be unfair to both Samsung and its competitors since all we have right now are rumors.. The aspects like pricing are all uncertain yet. Although one thing is certain, if Samsung can create anything close to what the rumors say and at the same time price the device as per the people’s liking, the throne of this market will be theirs yet again. What are your expectations with the device?. Dated 22nd May, 2017 – New rumors have started coming on web regarding the maximum screen coverage on front. This states that more than 95% of the front space will be covered by the screen and curved on four edges. For more details, you can read this article ..

The whole concept is to make the new device 40% more energy efficient and 30% powerful & faster than all the other devices.. Yes, we are talking about 7nm chipset technology to be unveiled in 2018 with Galaxy S9.. 2017 is a successful year for Samsung with the launch of Galaxy S8 featuring Snapdragon 835 processor. Although there are many drawbacks found in the new device. Wait for the new article in our blog providing the drawbacks of Galaxy S8.. Leave a Reply Cancel reply.

Built for the Way We Communicate Today: Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+. Galaxy S9 , mwc , MWC2018 , Smartphone , unpacked. The Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ fuel new discoveries with Super Slow-mo video, best-in-class low light camera and AR Emoji for a more personalized way to express yourself. Super Slow-mo: Make every day moments epic with dynamic, slow-motion video that captures 960 frames per second. The Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ also offers automatic Motion Detection, an intelligent feature that detects movement in the frame and automatically begins to record – all users have to do is set up the shot. After capturing the Super Slow-mo video, users can select background music from 35 different options. Low Light Camera : Good lighting is the secret to any great photo. But often, photos are taken in less-than-ideal lighting conditions and most smartphone cameras have a fixed aperture that can’t adjust to low or bright lighting environments resulting in grainy or washed out pictures. Similar to the way the iris of a human eye expands and contracts, Samsung’s Dual Aperture [1] (F1.5 – F2.4) automatically lets in more light when it’s dark and less light when it’s too bright, taking photos that are crisp and clear anytime, anywhere. AR Emoji: Samsung lets users create an emoji that looks, sounds and acts just like them. AR Emoji uses a data-based machine learning algorithm, which analyzes a 2D image of the user and maps out more than 100 facial features to create a 3D model that reflects and imitates expressions, like winks and nods, for true personalization. AR Emoji uses a standard AGIF file format, so users can share their emojis across most third-party messaging platforms. Bixby: Samsung’s intelligence platform, integrated into the camera, uses augmented reality and deep learning technologies to provide helpful information about a user’s surroundings. [2] With real-time object detection and recognition, Bixby instantly generates information directly on top of the image that the camera is pointing at. Users can translate foreign languages and currency in real time with Live Translation, learn about their surroundings, purchase products seen in the real world from retailers such as Walmart and Sam’s Club, or track calories throughout the day.

Samsung Galaxy S9+ - user opinions and reviews. I don't know where you get your information... It's been said that the S9 wasn't going to be flexible, Samsung has been working on a flexible phone called the Galaxy X.. I guess it will come to reality pretty soon. Though they are still perfecting it perhaps because of screen burn issues on their amoled screens. Yep, at the current AU-EUR rates the S9+ would cost me AU$1550. If the camera is a big step up i will get the S9+. The S8+ camera is still awesome so I'm not convinced the difference will be that great..

Samsung Galaxy S9 Memory and RAM:. Samsung is one of the reputed brands in the Android smartphone industry. Samsung has recently launched its new flagship device called Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 plus. We know it is too early to talk about Samsung Galaxy S9 release date and price. Samsung launched the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 EDGE this year, and speculations have already started what is going to be the features of Samsung Galaxy S8. There are many people who are searching for Galaxy S9 and S9 EDGE which is one more year left to launch.. The Galaxy S8 is now available in stores and online. However, Samsung has recently started developing its successor. Although that will not appear shocking, it’s still a whole lot earlier than expected. And it’s great information for fans of Samsung’s flagship smartphones. For starters, we all know that Samsung is currently only too large to keep secrets. The organization wasn’t ready to stop any Galaxy S8 leaks inside the weeks preceding the phone’s launch. The sooner it begins building the Galaxy S9, the more we’ll find out about the phone.. But that’s not the true reason why it’s great to hear the Galaxy S9 development is underway. The fact that Samsung is working on the following-gen Galaxy S flagship some 6 months ahead of the plan suggests that Samsung is paying extra attention to product quality, and that’s great news for customers.. Moreover, an earlier start can result in an earlier launch. This season, Samsung needed to hang the Galaxy S8’s story and discharge to manage the fallout of the Galaxy Note 7 recall and to make sure its next flagship won’t see a similar fate.. A study In The Bell says the Galaxy S9 growth began properly because of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle last year. “Since late last month, a display group for the S9 has started the development use aims to produce samples from mid-April,” a source said. The Galaxy S9 is likely to come in two measurements similar to the Galaxy S8, but different specific facts aren’t known right now.. The report also describes the Galaxy Note 8, known internally as “Project Excellent,” that will also be in development. The phone can apparently have a 6.32-inch Infinity screen and may feature a fingerprint sensor incorporated into the screen like Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8. A report earlier this week said Samsung’s Galaxy X phone is at least two decades away, dispelling rumors the first collapsible Galaxy handset might start later this season.. The Galaxy S series is one of the most popular smartphone series from the South Korean company. The first ever phone was introduced in June 2010 and then every successor been a great hit in terms of a number of devices sold. Most of Galaxy S series phones are released in April & May. So it is expected that Samsung will release its new Galaxy S9 Release date.. The new Galaxy S9 has an all-glass body compared to modern smartphones. The Galaxy S8 comes in two sizes – the S8 with a 5.8-inch display, measuring 148.9 x 68.1 x8.0 mm, and the S8 plus with a 6.2-inch display, with 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1 mm dimensions.. The physical Home button has been removed and replaced with a pressure-sensitive panel placed underneath the screen so that the front of the device is a sheer pane of glass.. The fingerprint reader is now located on the back of the phone, next to the camera module. The phone also supports iris scanning for added security. So many users are facing issues with this.. Samsung Galaxy S9 will be powered by the futuristic device Snapdragon 830 chipset. This chipset will offer blazing fast performance to the Samsung Galaxy S9.. Samsung Galaxy S9 Memory and RAM: It comes with to have a whopping 6GB RAM for fast multitasking experience. And the internal memory hinted to have 128GB, which is quite decent to have. I also will support accept external memory as well.. As far as the price of Galaxy S9, it will be in accordance with the advanced features and specs. I predict the price between a range of $800-$850 for the 16GB model.. Samsung is popular for its OLED screens. Recently the tech giant has launched its new Galaxy series smartphones including Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. From the beginning, OLED screens have been challenging for manufacturers to produce. Recently Apple is rumored to be launching a 5.8-inch iPhone 8 with an edge-to-edge OLED screen alongside two other LCD-based models this fall. Hope you liked our complete article regarding.

This is the conundrum Samsung faced creating the Galaxy S9 , but the company seems to have found a few areas to improve its popular handset.. The Galaxy S8 was nearly perfect. It delivered an immersive smartphone experience, thanks to the Infinity Display, and pushed the boundaries of smartphone design more than ever before. The camera improved a little over the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S8 Plus was a big phone for those who wanted something a little larger.. Further reading: Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus are here: the best just got better. With the Galaxy S9, Samsung has kept similar design but tweaked it to create a better overall experience. There are two devices again this year. While the form factor and display size are the same as last year, both devices have a slightly smaller overall footprint. The Galaxy S8 Plus especially was a pretty tall device but the Galaxy S9 Plus is a little more manageable in the hand; by reducing the bezels above and below the display, Samsung has managed to shave 1.2 mm off the height of the Galaxy S9 and 1.4 mm off the Galaxy S9 Plus.. The displays themselves have also been tweaked a little, offering 15 percent higher peak brightness. The Galaxy S8 topped out at around 600 nits, while the Galaxy S9 is expected to achieve closer to 700 nits. For those bright sunny days, this extra brightness should help with overall legibility. The phones’ curves are not as steep as the S8 line, nor do their displays run all the way to the edge. Samsung says this is designed to prevent accidental touches along the edge of the screen and it will hopefully also address the light banding issue when watching a video.. The Galaxy S9 also bring stereo speakers to a Samsung smartphone for the first time. After its acquisition of Harman Kardon last year , the Korean manufacturer set about improving the audio on its devices, previously one of the poorest experience on any smartphone. This year, there are two speakers â a forward facing one joins the bottom-firing speaker from last year.. What you need to know about Dolby Atmos sound. Dolby is a well-known company in the cinema and home theater space, involved in the design of cutting edge technologies used on both the video and audio side of professional and consumer equipment. Both have been tuned by AKG. As a result, the speakers are noticeably louder. Samsung says the overall output is 1.4 times louder than the Galaxy S8. Samsung also partnered with Dolby to add the Atmos codec to the Galaxy S9 â once enabled, it offers spatial sound playback which helps to add to the overall immersive experience.. The most controversial part of the Galaxy S8 family was the fingerprint sensor, which Samsung chose to place right next to the camera in a very awkward position. The company has finally addressed this in the S9 by moving it to the center, beneath the camera. The new positioning works well enough and means the sensor is useful again. On the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 , the positioning was awkward enough to be uncomfortable.. Those are the small improvements over the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, but the big improvements are in the camera. As part of its theme of being able to express yourself, the Galaxy S9 camera brings a collection of new camera features, as well as some tweaks to the Galaxy S8 camera.. The Galaxy S9 camera features the same hardware as the Galaxy S8 with a 12 MP super speed dual pixel sensor with optical image stabilization. The Galaxy S9 Plus also features the secondary camera found on the Galaxy Note 8, a 12 MP telephoto lens with OIS and f/2.4 aperture. Both devices feature 8 MP front-facing cameras with f/1.7 aperture.. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus specs. The low light performance on Samsung phones previously let down the camera experience, but the Galaxy S9 looks to improve this with dual aperture and multi-frame image processing. The Galaxy S9 has a mechanical lens that opens and closes. For bright scenes, itâll use the tighter f/2.4 aperture and for low light scenes, itâll use a wider f/1.5 aperture. As a result, Samsung says there is 28 percent more light coming into the system than the Galaxy S8, which should improve the low light camera performance. The mechanical aperture is hardware based and doesnât offer any aperture stops between the two. By default, the Galaxy S9 automatically picks which aperture to use but in Pro mode, you can control it.. The Galaxy S9 takes the detail and information from 12 photos to create one excellent photo. The multi-frame image processing is also new to the Galaxy S9 and itâs designed to help with noise reduction. The Galaxy S9 comes with DRAM on the camera sensor itself, which means the camera can capture four times as many photos at four times the speed. In a split second, the camera takes 12 images which are then sorted into batches of four. The software then uses all the detail and information for processing and noise reduction. It does this three times to give you the best three photos from each batch. The software then does it one more time on the three photos to get the overall best photo.. The DRAM isnât just used for multi-frame image processing, but also for super slow-motion video. The Galaxy S8 offered 720p super slow-motion video at 240 fps, but the Galaxy S9 now offers it at 960 fps. This isnât new to smartphones but the automatic mode is definitely a step above other devices. Instead of having to time exactly when to press record, the Galaxy S9 will also do it for you and all you have to do is press record.. The automatic mode works rather well and once you take a super slow-motion video, it also saves several shareable GIFs including effects such as loop and reverse. For those who want to relive a great super slow-motion video, you can save the video as your lock screen wallpaper. The software also automatically adds background music to the video, which you can then change to one of the preset sounds or a song from your music library.. Top 9 features on the Samsung Galaxy S9. The Galaxy S9 follows the lead of the iPhone X and brings a new feature called AR Emoji. This feature captures your face, analyzes it, and allows you to make an animated version of yourself which can be customized further. The customization options include two different types of animation, either more life-like or more cartoon-like. You can also change the hair, skin tone, glasses, clothes of the image. After youâve finished customizing your AR Emoji, itâll save 18 GIFs to your phoneâs gallery, as well as the Samsung keyboard, so you can easily share it with your friends. AR Emoji lets you record either photos or videos. While you can talk and move your head, itâs doesnât seem to pick up as many facial expressions as the iPhone X.. Camera aside, the Galaxy S9 also brings a series of other improvements to Bixby , connectivity, and security. Bixby has gained a new food mode, which allows you to point the camera towards a piece of food and get nutritional information about it. Using the selfie camera, the new makeup mode allows you to try on makeup from Sephora or CoverGirl and buy it straight from Bixby.. The Galaxy S8 had two different biometric security options â Face Unlock and the Iris Scanner. The Galaxy S9 combines these into a new feature called Intelligent Scan. Samsung says both of these were great in certain scenarios and by combining them, it gets around the issues faced especially by the Iris Scanner. Intelligent Scan uses Iris Scanning as the primary security option for applications that need higher levels of security, like banking apps or Samsung Pay. For day-to-day unlocking of your phone Intelligent Scan uses the convenient super-fast experience of Face Unlock. How well does it work? This remains to be seen but weâll find out in our Galaxy S9 review in the near future.. The Galaxy S9 is the first smartphone powered by the Snapdragon 845 processor and brings Gigabit LTE support. The regular Galaxy S9 comes with 4 GB of RAM, while the Galaxy S9 Plus has 6 GB of RAM. Both devices are IP68 water and dust resistant, offer fast wireless storage, and have a headphone jack. Both come with 64 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded by up to 400 GB using a microSD card.. The Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus will launch in three colors in the U.S. â Midnight Black, Lilac Purple and Coral Blue. The fourth color â Titanium Gray â isnât coming to the U.S. Itâs not entirely certain how much they will cost, but pre-orders launch on March 2,Â. ahead of its March 16 release. Samsung is also offering its first-ever global pre-order offer called Trade Up and Save, allowing you to get up to $350 off the cost of the Galaxy S9 when you trade in last yearâs flagship from any manufacturer. Trade Up and Save offers tiers so those with a Galaxy S7 or two-year-old flagship from another OEM will receive a little less..

Put the Samsung Galaxy S9 next to the Galaxy S8 , and you’ll struggle to find an immediate difference between the two. Samsung’s latest flagship, announced at Mobile World Congress 2018 , boasts quality of smartphone life improvements: Minor changes to the Galaxy S8’s design make for a much better smartphone experience. In particular, it addresses one of the biggest disappointments of the S8 — how similar its camera was to the Galaxy S7. With the Galaxy S9 and especially the Galaxy S9 Plus, the camera has been “reimagined,” with features we’ve never seen before on a phone. It’s exciting, but also a little perplexing. Ever taken a look at the Galaxy S8’s Iris Scanner and think it sticks out like a sore thumb? Do you hate the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the S8 Plus? These are the sort of things the design-savvy among us fret about, and items Samsung has pondered and refined on the S9 and S9 Plus.. The Iris Scanner is now darker so it blends in with the edges around the screen. These edges or bezels are also slightly smaller, giving you even more screen real estate than before. Other than these two minor improvements, the front of these two new smartphones looks undeniably similar to that of its predecessors. That’s a good thing, because the Galaxy S9 continues to look stellar — super sleek and ultra-modern.. Perhaps more important, Samsung has placed the fingerprint sensor in a new position on the back of the S9 and S9 Plus, directly underneath the camera. The old placement made the sensor difficult to reach; it’s certainly much improved now. And this is largely a part of the biggest and most noticeable design difference between the S9 and the S8 devices, The sensor is lower, the flash is on the right side of the camera, and specifically on the Galaxy S9 Plus, you’ll find a dual-camera system. It’s the first time the Galaxy S-series features dual cameras — the first Galaxy device to utilize them is the Note 8 .. The back of the phone doesn’t mention the device’s name, it just has Samsung’s logo in the center, a minor change over last year. There’s still the curved edges (also on the front), along with the all-glass back for fast wireless charging.. We’re still mesmerized by the Infinity Display.. The right edge of the phone is where you’ll find the power button; the left edge holds a volume rocker and the famed Bixby button below it. On the bottom edge is a bottom-firing speaker next to a USB Type-C charging port, and you may be surprised to hear there still is a headphone jack. The speaker, for the first time, works in tandem with the earpiece at the top of the phone, offering stereo sound tuned by AKG that’s 1.4 times louder than the Galaxy S8. Best of all, the speakers utilize Dolby Atmos technology , which helps make it room-filling and immersive. We’re impressed with the sound quality and how loud the speakers got from the brief music we heard. Still, it’s a bummer Samsung didn’t use dual front-facing speakers.. Both phones still manage to feel compact, while maintaining a large screen. The Galaxy S9 has the same 5.8-inch screen, and the S9 Plus comes in at 6.2 inches.. We love the design of the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus, and we’re still mesmerized by the Infinity Display, even if it’s not much different from the screen on the Galaxy S8. The changes do improve the user experience, and we’re happy to see them. Better yet, there are a few beautiful colors coming to the U.S. we’re excited about — lilac purple, coral blue, and midnight black.. Before diving into the specifications, let’s check out Samsung’s biggest selling point for the S9 and S9 Plus. The company’s heavily pushing the idea of a reimagined camera, and it’s right in saying so, because the S9’s camera has something we’ve never seen before on a phone — a mechanical aperture.. An aperture is the hole in a camera that takes in light. The bigger the hole, the more light the camera can use, which is notably important for low-light photography. An aperture is measured by F-stops, and the lower the number, the bigger the hole. (For more info, read our guide to camera settings and controls .) The Galaxy S9’s 12-megapixel camera has an f/1.5 aperture, the lowest ever yet on a smartphone, as well as an f/2.4 aperture.. We’ll have to do more testing to see the benefits of having a mechanical aperture system.. It’s a mechanical lens, which means if you look at the back of the camera, you can see it switch between apertures. Samsung said the camera uses the f/2.4 aperture during the day, when the camera doesn’t need to take in as much light, while it automatically opts for the f/1.5 aperture at night to absorb as much as possible.. The switch occurs automatically, but you can change it yourself in manual mode. Yes, it’s fast, but we’re not sure quite yet why we need to switch between two apertures — why not just stick to a fixed f/1.5? We’ll have to do more testing to see the benefits of this mechanical system.. You’re meant to never really notice this change happening when you use the camera, so how does it fare in general use? The S9 took photos quickly, and in the limited time we had, the results looked good. We’ll be experimenting with the camera during Mobile World Congress, so we’ll add more thoughts here once we’ve spent more time with it in varying lighting conditions.. The Galaxy S9 Plus does indeed come with a second lens — a 12-megapixel, f/2.4 telephoto lens. It does the same thing as the second camera on the Galaxy Note 8. You can take Portrait Mode-like photos with the Live Focus tool, where a blur effect is added behind subjects, and you can utilize the 2× optical zoom to take close up photos of remote objects.. It’s a shame the second camera isn’t available on the regular S9, but we’re happy both get the unique mechanical aperture camera. There’s also an important improvement in the camera processing software worth mentioning — multi-frame noise reduction. Tapping the camera shutter icon on the Galaxy S9 now technically captures 12 photos, more than ever before, and this will bring a reduction in graininess or noise by 30 percent. Samsung showed us comparison shots from the S8 and the S9, and the latter had significantly less noise in darker parts of the photo. We’re excited to see how this impacts the overall low-light results from the camera.. The camera app itself has been redesigned to make it easier to swipe through modes, and it functions a lot like the iPhone camera app. If you swipe to the left from the Auto mode, you’ll be introduced to a new category on a Samsung phone: Super slow-motion. Like Sony’s Xperia devices , the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus can shoot slow-motion video at up to 960 frames per second. That’s about 32 times slower than real life. Samsung’s version can predict the part of the video you likely want to slow down, and it worked without a hitch when we tried it.. The quality is limited to 720p resolution, and the technology uses machine learning to apply a music track (from a small database) depending on the context of the video. So it can throw in a romantic song if you’re doing a slow-motion video of pouring wine, or something more upbeat if you’re popping a can of confetti. The software will automatically convert these video files into Loop, Swing, or Reverse GIFs so it’s easy to share.. Yet another new addition is AR Emoji, and sadly it’s a pale imitation of the iPhone X’s Animoji. You can become an animated character, like a bunny, and the camera will loosely track your movements and facial expressions. We say loosely because it didn’t follow details such as raised eyebrows and other expressions as accurately as the iPhone’s True Depth camera. Perhaps it’s because the front camera on the S9 is the same 8-megapixel f/1.7 camera as on the S8, with no fancy 3D depth-sensing features.. A feature called Create My Emoji lets you take a selfie that generates an AR Emoji in your likeness. You can then customize it further, and then use the AR tracking feature to create fun videos as the emoji, just like you can with Animojis.. AR Emoji is sadly a pale imitation of the iPhone X’s Animoji.. The Create My Emoji will also create an animated sticker pack with the AR Emoji version of yourself, and you can use this in any messaging app as it’s all saved in the gallery, or right in the Samsung keyboard. But would you really? We found ourselves unlikely to use these in conversation as they simply don’t look fun to share. Samsung does have a partnership with Disney to add characters you can become through the AR Emoji experience, so hopefully those will look significantly better.. Improvements to Bixby are almost entirely limited to Bixby Vision, the camera-specific experience of Samsung’s AI assistant that the company unveiled last year for the S9. For example, image translation has improved to include instant live translation, in which the phone can overlay translated words on a subject without having to take a picture — just point the camera at a foreign phrase you want to understand. It works fairly quickly, and it uses Google Translate’s database. It also translates more languages than before, and can even convert up to 63 currencies in the same way.. Samsung Galaxy S9 Compared To. Other new additions include a new Makeup tool, where you can browse and apply makeup from Sephora and Cover Girl on your face in real time. If you like the look, you can buy makeup directly from the camera app. You can also point the Galaxy S9 camera at food, and it will pull the estimated amount of calories, allowing you to log it directly in S Health. We didn’t get to test a working demo of this, but the makeup tool works quickly and mapped onto faces accurately. This technology is already available. through certain services, including Sephora’s own app, but it’s nice to see it built into a phone.. The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus are powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 845 processor , which should improve speed and efficiency by 30 percent, according to the chip giant. Apps opened quickly and the camera performed reliably — we’ll have to do more testing, but this phone will undoubtedly be powerful. Only the S9 Plus will come with 6GB of RAM, however, as the regular S9 packs 4GB. It’s a part of what you get for paying more for the Plus, according to Samsung, including the second camera. Both phones come with 64GB of storage, and a MicroSD card slot lets you add plenty more if you need it.. The AMOLED screen hasn’t changed, with both devices packing a Quad HD+ 2,960 × 1,440 pixel resolution; the S9 has a slightly higher pixel density at 570 pixels per inch (PPI), whereas the S9 Plus has a 529 PPI. As usual, the screen gets incredibly bright, and it’s eye-poppingly colorful. It’s sharp, and with the Infinity Display design, it’s easy to get lost staring at it.. Even the battery sizes are the same, with a 3,000mAh capacity on the smaller S9 and a 3,500mAh battery on the S9 Plus. Both phones come equipped with fast wireless charging as usual, as well as fast wired charging.. We would have liked to see more secure face scanning technology.. The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus run Android 8.0 Oreo, but it doesn’t look much different from the software experience on the Galaxy S8 thanks to Samsung’s own user interface. You’ll get access to all the Oreo features including picture-in-picture mode; read our Android 8.0 Oreo guide. We’ll take a deeper dive to see what other improvements there are here in the software, but we’re disappointed to see there’s no major improvements to Bixby other than the newly announced camera features. Bixby is still slow to open when you press the Bixby button.. Samsung lets you unlock the phone with your iris or face, as well as with the fingerprint sensor, but it has added a new feature called Intelligent Scan. We didn’t get to test it out, but it mixes both iris and facial scanning technologies, and falls back on the latter if iris recognition doesn’t work. We would have liked to see more secure face scanning technology here that could be adopted by other services, notably banks, but it looks like the iPhone X will continue to maintain that advantage.. Both phones still have an IP68 water-resistance rating, which means you can submerge them underwater up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes.. The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus will be available for pre-order on March 2, with official retail availability starting on March 16. Grabbing the Galaxy S9 from Samsung will set you back $719.99, or $30 a month for 24 months, while the S9 Plus will start from $839.99, or $35 a month for 24 months. If you’re looking to upgrade from an older Samsung Galaxy device, then Samsung is also offering a trade-in program that could see a maximum of $350 taken off the price of a brand new Galaxy S9 or S9 Plus.. Is there a reason to upgrade from the Galaxy S8? Not really, unless the fingerprint sensor bothers you that much, or you hate the camera. If you’re coming from a Galaxy S7, the camera will easily impress, as will everything else. We’ll need to do more testing to see how the phone fares against the current competition..

Eager to put the Galaxy Note 7 disaster in the rearview, Samsung used 2017 to double down on impressive, feature-packed smartphones. Last year's Note 8 and S8 handsets both impressed in a big way, bringing edge-to-edge, AMOLED-powered displays into the mainstream long before Apple was able to get the iPhone X to market. Naturally, as the smartphone expo of Mobile World Congress gets going today in Barcelona, Spain, it's time to welcome the Samsung Galaxy S9.. The new S9 looks almost like last year's S8, and that's completely intentional. Both the S9 and S9+ refine the Galaxy's already mature design. Perhaps the biggest physical change here (besides the addition of a badass Lilac Purple color option) is around the back of the phone, where the fingerprint scanner has been moved to sit just below the camera. This addresses one of the biggest gripes users had with the S8, since it was stupidly easy to smudge up the camera's glass cover when feeling around for the tiny fingerprint pad.. Two versions of the flagship Sammy phone will be available: a 5.8-inch S9 and a whopping 6.2-inch S9+. All the standard Samsung features have been branded this generation as "Galaxy Foundation," and no, that's not a new non-profit charity. This term sums up all the things that make a Galaxy a Galaxy—stuff like IP68 water and dust protection, fast wireless charging, and microSD memory expansion. New in the S9 and S9+ is an enhanced biometric security setting that combines the slower, more secure iris scanner with facial recognition. There's even a headphone jack, which seems like such a luxury in 2018.. Sure sounds like a Samsung phone, doesn't it?. The thing Samsung hyped the most when debuting S9's is its new-and-improved camera. The marquee ability of the S9's upgraded imaging hardware is a variable-aperture camera. The 12-megapixel, optically-stabilized main cameras of both the S9 and S9+ have two aperture settings thanks to an aperture plate on both phones that slides in place whenever it's needed. Wide open, the camera gathers more light in dim situations at a fast f/1.5 aperture. When stopped down, it shoots in f/2.4, which is better for brighter environments. The camera's other major trick is a super slow-motion setting, which leverages an on-sensor data buffer to shoot up to 960 frames per second.. Jumping into the animated, facial-mapped emoji craze, Samsung is introducing AR Emoji. Competing with the iPhone X's Animoji , AR Emoji gives users a cartoon version of themselves they can use to express a range of emotions and reactions. The animations can be sent via SMS, and you can export a custom animation as a GIF, though Samsung's take on this is more Nintendo Mii than anything.. Additionally, Samsung has added improvements to DeX, the app that lets you connect the phone to a keyboard and monitor for desktop-like experience. The new phones also get stereo Dolby Atmos-powered speakers, ever-so-slightly narrower bezels, the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip, and some new Bixby abilities for good measure.. Preorders for the S9 and S9+ begin Friday, March 2. Retail stores will start carrying the new models on March 16. The S9 will start at $719 unlocked, while its larger Plus-sized sibling will go for $839.. How to customize your Android phone. The Chrome extensions the WIRED staff can’t live without.

The Samsung Galaxy S9 improves on the S8's camera and audio, and the S9+ adds dual cameras, but the phones aren't a huge step forward for Samsung.. The Samsung Galaxy S9 ($719.99 unlocked) isn't radical. It won't shock you, and it hasn't been reinvented. But it looks like a really good phone , with a great low-light camera, loud speakers, and terrific network performance. We spent some time with the S9 and its larger sibling, the S9+ ($839.99 unlocked), in advance of their launch at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. This preview isn't a full review; it's based on about 90 minutes of use in Samsung's demo room, which isn't enough time to shake out all the features. But it should give you an initial picture of what to expect when the phones are available March 16.. If you squint really closely at the front of the Galaxy S9, you'll notice that the iris scanner isn't quite as visible as on the Galaxy S8. But really, it's very difficult to tell a Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S9 apart until you flip them over, at which point you see that the fingerprint sensor has been moved from next to the camera, to below it. It's still too close to the camera for comfort, though. I can imagine feeling around the back of the phone for the fingerprint sensor and hitting the camera. So Samsung is pushing "intelligent scan," which first tries iris scanning for authentication, then falls back to less secure facial recognition if it can't get an iris.. View All 15 Photos in Gallery. The Galaxy S9 measures 5.8 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 5.8 ounces. The Galaxy S9+ measures 6.2 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches and weighs 6.7 ounces. Both are slightly shorter, wider, and heavier than their predecessors (respectively 5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 and 5.5 ounces , and 6.3 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches and weighs 6.1 ounces ), but not so much that you notice.. On the bottom, you find the same USB-C port and traditional 3.5mm headphone jack as on the Galaxy S8. The phone comes in 64, 128, and 256GB storage versions, and there's also a microSD card slot. So far, so much like the Galaxy S8.. Both models have stereo speakers: one is in the earpiece, facing forward, and one is on the bottom of the phone. Samsung says the speakers are 40 percent louder than the Galaxy S8's, and in testing, the phone definitely sounds louder. For people who make calls, that affects the speakerphone volume, too.. The phones have Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processors, with four cores running at 2.8GHz and four at 1.7GHz. They run Android 8.0 Oreo .. The S9's Qualcomm X20 modem can run at speeds up to 1.2Gbps, although no US carrier currently supports those kinds of numbers. It'll work with every frequency band that US carriers currently use, including both Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) on the Wi-Fi bands and T-Mobile's new 600MHz Band 71. There's also dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, but nothing really exotic LAN-wise like 802.11ad or ax.. The phones' 5.8- and 6.2-inch AMOLED screens are the same size and resolution as the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Samsung says they're brighter, but they don't appear to support the super-deep Rec 2020 color space that Qualcomm advertised for the Snapdragon 845. That may be a limit of today's OLED technology. In any case, I don't think you're going to find a better screen on a phone.. While the Galaxy S8 and S8+ had very similar specs except for their screen size and battery, Samsung gives you some real reasons to buy the big phone this year. The S9+ has two main cameras rather than one, with the second one providing 2x zoom. It has 6GB rather than 4GB of RAM. The battery is bigger, too, at 3,500mAh to the S9's 3,000mAh. I honestly didn't see a reason to buy the S8+ over the S8. These changes could make the difference.. The Galaxy S9's flagship new feature is its camera, and Samsung has done a lot of on it. Both the S9 and S9+ have 8-megapixel front-facing cameras and 12-megapixel main cameras. The S9+ adds a 12-megapixel 2x zoom secondary camera on the back, like the Galaxy Note 8 has.. Both the S9 and S9+ have new, dual aperture lenses that snap from f/2.4 or f/1.5 depending on lighting conditions. At light levels under 100 lux — basically indoor lighting — they'll pop open to f/1.5, letting more light in. You can also control the change manually in the camera's pro mode. You can actually see the iris open up if you look closely at the camera.. The Galaxy S9's camera aperture: Left: f/1.5, Right: f/2.4. The S9 also has, Samsung says, multi-frame noise reduction, which grabs 12 frames very quickly and then interpolates them to reduce the noise in low-light images. According to Samsung it captures images with 30 percent less noise than on the Galaxy S8 and 60 percent less than on the S7 .. The result is really good low-light photography. We tested the GS9 against the GS8 in a low-light tube in Samsung's office, and the GS9 showed brighter colors and much less background noise. This may not translate into taking better photos in the actual dark, but it will definitely translate into taking better photos, say, outdoors at night under streetlights, in a restaurant, or in a dimly lit living room.. Left to right: Galaxy S9+, Galaxy S8+. Samsung also put memory right under the image sensor, the same way Sony has, to enable 960fps slow-motion. The GS9 can capture up to 20, 0.2-second clips at that super-slow-mo level; it needs a moment to flush the memory buffer out after each clip. Because it's really difficult to guess which 0.2-second you're going to want, the camera also has an auto-detect mode where it starts recording normal video, and then kicks into super-slow-mo when it detects motion in the frame. We tried it several times, and it worked.. Image captured as part of a 960fps slow-motion video. The super-slo-mo clip becomes a short video, but the GS9 also creates three 4MB highlight GIFs that have much smaller file sizes than the video, and are easier to share. That's some pretty great handholding for anyone who wants to post their slow-mo quickly to social networks.. The GS9 introduces Samsung's animoji competitor, which the company calls "AR emoji." The idea is amazing: The GS9 scans your face (or that of a friend) and creates a custom emoji based on it. You can then change the character's hair, clothes, or glasses. The phone starts churning out pre-animated stickers, but it'll also let you create your own short videos with the character mimicing your facial expressions.. My AR emoji was disappointingly generic, though: I just looked like a middle-aged white guy, and while I am, in fact, a middle-aged white guy, I was hoping for a better resemblance. The animations also appear a bit stiff. The whole thing is better than Bitmoji, but Bitmoji are a horrific plague that need to be scoured from the earth by fire.. The GS9 also gives you three animoji-like cartoon characters: a cute bunny, a blue robot, and a pink cat. The bunny is pretty expressive; the other two seem limited and a bit rigid. Samsung says Disney-branded characters will be coming after launch, but we'd like to see a broader array of non-creepy, non-uncanny-valley options.. Samsung needs Bixby , and software, to be a thing. If they aren't, Samsung is just another Google-powered hardware maker, and it's tough to go up against Chinese competitors on that basis. So Samsung is continuing to push its Bixby AI system, Samsung Connect smart home apps, and DeX desktop-transforming gadgets.. With the Galaxy S9, Samsung seems to be stepping back from the idea of Bixby as a voice assistant and pushing its AI-powered camera features. That's a good move; the Bixby/Google Assistant confusion on the S8 was essentially unsolvable. Instead, Samsung's pushing Bixby's ability to translate languages in images on the fly, to count the calories in food seen through the phone's camera, and to identify places and give you things to do. These are all things that third-party apps do already, but Samsung is hoping that the power of defaults will cause people to see them as differentiating features.. For what it's worth, the Bixby camera features work. We translated a German sign into ungrammatical, but comprehensible, English. The calorie counter worked on five different kinds of food, and the calorie data syncs with S Health, the preloaded health app that tracks your steps and other fitness metrics. It's still an open question whether average users will notice or use these features, though, as they've ignored camera modes in the past.. DeX, which turns the phone into a desktop PC, faltered with the S8 because it wasn't clear who it was for. Originally, it required an external keyboard, mouse, and monitor, which can get clumsy to lug around. The new DeX Pad gives traveling businesspeople a reason to want DeX: It's a presentation system. The Pad is a dock your GS9 snaps into, flat, so the phone becomes a touchpad and virtual keyboard for the virtual desktop PC. You still need to plug in an HDMI monitor, and you can still plug in a keyboard and mouse if you want. But using the phone for input makes DeX a valid way to throw business presentations onto screens when you're in meetings, which could be a compelling use.. Left to right: Galaxy S8+, iPhone X, Galaxy S9+. Samsung had a huge hit with the Galaxy S8, and the similarity between the S8 and S9 doesn't mean the company has stopped radically innovating. For more than a year now, we've been tracking rumors about a "Galaxy X" foldable phone, which has reportedly been in the works for at least a year. Rumors now have that phone scheduled for the second half of this year, and it could float out further — its design is just that radical.. So the Galaxy S9 is here to keep the faith and to keep the fires burning. If you're not a phone geek who's thirsting for innovation, it looks like a rock-solid performer.. Smartphone makers tend to take radical jumps in form factor every two years. So the Galaxy S9 is primarily an improvement on Galaxy S8 concepts: it has louder speakers, a better camera, and a faster modem, but it won't rock or shock anyone used to the Galaxy S8.. The Galaxy S9 will be a great upgrade for Galaxy S7 owners, and if its camera promises hold out, it takes away one of the Google Pixel 2 XL 's major selling points. Galaxy S8 owners may want to step up for the better low-light camera, or the support for T-Mobile's rural 600MHz network. The new phone doesn't, at first glance, change the balance of power between Samsung and Apple, but it doesn't need to.. See our separate story for pricing across individual carriers. We'll have a full review of the Galaxy S9 and S9+ shortly before the March 16 launch.. Bottom Line: The Samsung Galaxy S9 improves on the S8's camera and audio, and the S9+ adds dual cameras, but the phones aren't a huge step forward for Samsung..

Samsung Galaxy S9 review (hands on): a refined Android flagship with show-stealing camera system. Samsung takes one step back to take two steps forward with the Galaxy S9, the most premium and polished phone of 2018. Viewed in snapshot, the Samsung Galaxy S9 is simply a refined version of last year's S8, with an almost identical hardware suite packed into that lush slab of metal and glass. However, look closer and you see that it not only delivers a standout, party-piece camera system, but also a selection of innovative features and software that point towards a maturing of Samsung's approach to delivering a flagship Android experience.. 12MP rear camera with dual-aperture technology. Still fabulous Super AMOLED 18.5:9 QHD+ screen. AR Emoji, while not perfect, are lots of fun. Similar specs to the Galaxy S8.

Get up to speed in our MWC18 hub Samsung Galaxy S9 review: price, colours, and release date. Samsung Galaxy S9 review: design and build quality Samsung Galaxy S9 review: screen and hardware Samsung Galaxy S9 review: camera Samsung Galaxy S9 review: AR Emoji and Bixby AI assistant Samsung Galaxy S9 review: audio, battery and software Samsung Galaxy S9 review: early verdict Make sure you check out our Samsung Galaxy Note 8 review, too. Processor: Octa-core processor (2.7 GHz Quad + 1.7 GHz Quad). Display: 5.8-inch Quad HD + Curved Super AMOLED, 18.5:9 (570ppi). Rear camera: Super Speed Dual Pixel 12MP AF sensor with OIS (F1.5/F2.4). Front camera: 8MP AF (F1.7). Dimensions: 147.7mm x 68.7mm x 8.5mm. Storage (external): MicroSD up to 400GB. From a technological point of view, the Samsung Galaxy S9 has one standout piece of new hardware, its rear dual-aperture 12MP camera.. As has been more than evident from Samsung's marketing in the run up to the Samsung Galaxy S9's launch , this year's flagship offering has very much been centered around how it has "reimagined the smartphone camera" and, having seen what it can do and how it works in our Samsung S9 hands-on review testing period, we can see why.. The Samsung Galaxy S9's new camera system also sits at the heart of this year's other innovations, such as Super Slow-mo recording, AR Emoji, and an upgraded version of Samsung's Bixby assistant AI, which now delivers real-time object detection and recognition, so again its focus makes sense.. On the flip side of the coin, we also understand Samsung's keenness to let the camera draw the eye as very little else from a hardware view has changed, with the Samsung Galaxy S9 packing with the same battery, screen, RAM, and internal storage as the Samsung Galaxy S8,. which naturally is now far cheaper.. To discover whether this is a crippling blow or not to Samsung's 2018 flagship read on.. The Samsung Galaxy S9 will be available in the UK (and worldwide) from March 16th, with pre-orders open on February 25th from 18:00 GMT.. The Samsung Galaxy S9 will be available in three colours: Lilac Purple, Midnight Black and Coral Blue.. The Samsung Galaxy S9 will cost £739. The phone will be purchasable directly from Samsung as well as select retailers.. Check out our Samsung Galaxy S9 deals page for the best S9 prices!. Take a quick glance at the Samsung Galaxy S9 and you'd be hard pushed to differentiate it from last year's S8. The phone is slightly wider and heavier than the S8, and the top and bottom bezels have also been shrunk a little more, producing a slightly shorter device in the hand.. The phone's Iris scanner hole has been hidden in the top bezel, producing a cleaner overall look, while the Samsung Galaxy S9's fingerprint scanner has been shifted to beneath the phone's dual-aperture rear camera.. From our hands-on usage period, we can confirm that this new central positioning is a small but marked improvement - it's just a more natural position for unlocking the phone.. Yes, we said it once, and we'll say it again: the Samsung Galaxy S9 has the exact same display as the Samsung Galaxy S8. It's the same 5.8-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED screen with 18.5:9 aspect ratio, and it is the same Infinity Display, too, meaning that 90 per cent of the phone's front is pure panel. Those now standard but still gorgeous curved edges are also still in residence.. And, guess what? It is still an absolute stunner. Yes, Samsung hasn't given the Galaxy S9 a new screen, but when the S8's was so good and way, way beyond the competition (even now), what does that matter? The Samsung Galaxy S9's screen is just fantastic and it makes viewing photos, playing games and watching films an absolute pleasure.. What Samsung has done that is new, is tweaked the screen's landscape mode, meaning that the whole user interface now rotates to fit the widescreen format, meaning that you can easily respond to messages and post to social media while still enjoying your media.. In terms of internal hardware spec, the Samsung Galaxy S9 comes equipped with 4GB of RAM (the S9+ has 6GB), 64GB of internal storage space and its new Exynos 9810 processor (well, everywhere except the US market, who are getting Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845 CPU).. This is the big takeaway from the S9. The new 12MP rear camera features Samsung's dual-aperture technology, something that allows for far better low-light photography. The system works by ditching a fixed aperture (common in smartphones) for one that can expand and contract like the iris of a human eye. This means that the S9's camera automatically lets in more light to its sensor when the surrounding environment is too dark, and then less light when it is too light.. The rear camera's super slow-motion video capture has also been improved, with the Samsung Galaxy S9 now capable of recording at 960fps at 720p, and 240fps at 1080p. Neatly, these slow-mo modes now come packing Motion Detection technology, meaning that all the user has to do is hold the phone up to the thing they want to record in slow-motion, with the camera then automatically beginning to record when it sees any motion in the capture field.. From what we've seen so far we are very impressed with the quality of slow-motion footage captured, which can be easily turned into a video, gif or even live wallpaper for the phone. We're also impressed with the accuracy and speed of the automatic motion detection.. Of course, the Samsung Galaxy S9's 12MP rear dual-aperture camera, and front-mounted 8MP camera are also absolutely crucial in terms of bringing users the S9's other innovative new features, AR Emoji and Bixby Vision.. Apple was onto something with Animoji on iPhone X it would seem, as Samsung has brought its own version to the Samsung Galaxy S9 – AR Emoji.. AR Emoji is a feature built into the system's camera application that allows a user to take a selfie of their face and then have it turned into a virtual avatar of them, one that the user can then dress and style as they choose.. The system works by analyzing the 2D image with a data-based learning algorithm, which maps out over 100 facial features to generate a 3D model that can reflect facial expressions and emotions.. You can then pose the AR Emoji by holding the camera up to you (as if you were taking a selfie) and the AR Emoji will mirror your expression and pose. At this point you can then take a picture of your AR Emoji, or record a video with sound of you speaking, with your avatar mimicking your actions. These videos are then saved as gifs for ease of sharing on your social or messaging application of choice.. You can also select from 18 different stock expressions if you just want to fire back a stock response to a message. Neatly, these are embedded into the Samsung keyboard, meaning you can bring them up and add them just as easily as regular emoji.. Multiple different AR Emoji can be created and stored on the Samsung Galaxy S9, too, with the whole process – providing you don't dilly-dally too long selecting the perfect hat – taking about 20-30 seconds or so.. Like one of Bertie Wooster's chums from the Drones Club, Bixby is back again in the Samsung Galaxy S9, and this time he's extra tanked up.. That means Bixby now has a live translation mode that allows you to simply point the phone's camera at a piece of foreign text (see above image as an example) and Bixby will automatically translate what it says to you on screen.. From our testing of this feature it seemed to work well, with the phone automatically translating a series of foreign texts in a variety of fonts and sizes. Often it took a moment or two make the translation, however, we had no outright failures. Obviously, we will be keen to test this Bixby Vision feature more for our full review.. Bixby Vision isn't hardware based, too, meaning that you do need a data connection for it to work.. Elsewhere, Samsung has also built out Bixby's AR capabilities, meaning that it can supply even more information about foods, monuments, locations and more, and Bixby is also location-aware.. The Samsung Galaxy S9 comes with the same 3,000mAh battery as was included in the S8 and, we've got to admit, this is the one area where we are disappointed with the lack of hardware movement.. We haven't been able to test the battery yet over an extended time period, though, so we will withhold judgement until we can run some benchmark tests. The S8's battery life was by no means poor, however: it was very much in the one-day charge range with moderate usage, so here's hoping the S9's new features don't affect that too much.. Audio on the Samsung Galaxy S9 is dealt with by a set of new stereo speakers tuned by AKG. These speakers come loaded with Dolby Atmos 360 degree audio capabilities, too. Dolby Atmos obviously is designed to improve compatible media, however, on the S9 it will also amplify and enhance definition on any media file.. From our ears-on time with the S9, we can confirm it doesn't struggle in terms of volume, and definition was enhanced on standard MP3 tracks when Dolby Atmos mode was activated. We will be keen to run more audio tests for our full review.. Finally, the Samsung Galaxy S9 comes loaded with Android 8.0 Oreo.. Samsung has always produced awesome flagship Android phones from a pure hardware point of view. Just look at last year's Galaxy S8, which not only blew all other Android phones released at the time out of the water but, in many cases, is only now been caught up with ( we're looking at you, HTC U11+ ) by competitors in terms of performance.. What it has, arguably, always never quite managed is syncing that powerhouse hardware with a holistically fluid, approachable, and interconnected user experience – something that Apple, despite lagging behind in terms of hardware, is a master of.. Samsung has been like a DJ operating a top-level set of decks connected to the best sound system money can buy, but one forgetting that it is the journey that the music takes people on which is the most important part of the overall experience.. What is evident here, though, from our first-impressions time with the Galaxy S9 is that Samsung appears to be starting to remix its focus, no doubt thanks to a maturing of vision and renewed confidence in the post-Note 8 world, and it has seemingly done so in a quietly subtle and effective way.. By focusing on how phone communication has moved from the ear to the eye, evidenced by the S9's superb new camera system and gimmick-transcending, system interwoven AR Emoji, Samsung appears to have produced a flagship smartphone that is confident to iteratively tweak its core hardware and then walk away to focus on other, more real-person relevant aspects and features.. Samsung now appears truly confident in its own skin and, by knowing when to walk away from the specification war, at a point where it is already the clear victor, it seems to have granted itself valuable breathing room to deliver a very relevant and on-trend user experience.. Naturally, we look forward to spending an extended period of time with the Samsung Galaxy S9 to see if our early impressions are validated, so be sure to check back in to T3 soon for our full review..

Those are the cool features you can expect on the S9.. Everyone is waiting for the unveiling of the 9th edition of the Samsung Galaxy line. Even with the current debacle with Samsung’s Galaxy S8, everyone’s eagerly awaiting the S9. The predecessor of the Samsung Galaxy S9 had several bugs. But the most notable of them was the uncanny ability of the S8 to spontaneously combust. The problem became somewhat a worry for Samsung, and it had to recall all of the S8s in the market.. The recall decision came after an S8 burst into flames in an airport, forcing flights to be grounded. Samsung is sure to have worked out the kinks by the time the Samsung galaxy s9 comes out.. What can we expect from Galaxy s9? Well, there’s no official word from Samsung yet, but we have a launch date. The Samsung Galaxy S9 is set to debut in the second quarter of 2017. Undoubtedly, Samsung will have solved the spontaneous nightmare that plagued the Samsung galaxy S8, on top of adding a few more features.. Here are a few rumors on the specs of the upcoming Samsung galaxy S9. What’s for certain the S9 won’t suffer the same teething problems observed in the S8.. Samsung Galaxy S9 Rumors Connectivity Display NFC (Near Field Communication) Artificial Intelligence Samsung Galaxy S9 Concept Samsung Galaxy S9 Specs Samsung Galaxy S9 Features Camera 4K Video Capability Battery RAM and Processor Storage Operating System Security Samsung Galaxy S9 Price. The South Korean Mobile manufacturer is one of the few mobile hardware companies known to push the technological envelope with every new device coming out of its factory. The Samsung galaxy s9 will push the envelope in mobile consumer hardware. The Samsung galaxy S9 is being made at a time where mobile computing technology is going through a makeover. Companies are making discoveries every day, and it’s quite possible the Samsung galaxy s9 will take advantage of some of these new technologies. Here’s what you have to look forward to.. For people looking for fast network capabilities, rumors have it that the. Samsung galaxy s9 will be powered by a 1 Gbps LTE Cat16 wireless chip allowing the S9 to take advantage of fast LTE networks, and the upcoming 5G networks. Standard connectivity options such as Wi-Fi cards and Bluetooth adapters are built on the Samsung Galaxy S9’s board.. For the display, we expect the standard 5.8-inch bezel-free, strengthened with a gorilla glass 4. Such a screen will have a resolution of 4096 by 2160, making it the best screen for 4K video display. What’s even amazing is the same gorilla glass will go on the back of the Samsung galaxy s9. That makes the phone scratch resistant straight out of the factory. Additionally, the screen will be slightly curved around the edges increasing the viewing angle.It Is Rumored Water Will Bounce Off The Samsung galaxy S9.. What’s interesting is Samsung signing deal Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). ORNL is behind some groundbreaking innovation that can be applied to electronic displays. ORNL developed a transparent coating resistant to dust and dirt. On top of that, the coating deflects light away from the screen and leaves no room for fingerprint smudges.. If Samsung includes this technology in the Samsung galaxy s9, the phone will take water resistance to new depths. According to ORNL, for a surface to achieve water resistance, it must have a contact angle more than 150 degrees.. The coating developed by the company gives a surface a contact angle in excess of 155 degrees, meaning water and dust bounce off the surface.. The most amazing feature of this Smartphone is that it has the NFC which is actually the exceptional feature of this Smartphone. NFC is the Near Field Communication and in this Smartphone, the purpose of NFC is to enable the short-range communications between the devices which are compatible with Samsung Galaxy S9 and Samsung Galaxy S9 Edge. This NFC will require one transmitting device and another device that will receive the signals from the transmitting device.. The Samsung Galaxy S9 will surely enjoy a better an improved artificial intelligence. Samsung acquired an artificial intelligence startup recently, and it is rumored engineers are working around the clock to bring something to rival the Amazon’s EcoDot. Viv, the artificial intelligence company Samsung bought, is a small company making leaps and bounds in artificial intelligence. It will be exciting to see which artificial intelligence does it best because Google bundles their own artificial intelligence in recent Android releases. Samsung has to compete Google’s Smartphones. why Samsung insert AI platform to win users over.. Samsung may launch Flexible Design and Foldable device next year: A thrilling Samsung promise. A metallic unibody with smooth edges will protect the Samsung’s inner mechanisms from water and other debris. The body will also be built to improve grip compared to other Samsung phones, and it is rumored Samsung might make Galaxy S9. The ability to fold and bend your screen might sound ultra-futuristic but the Samsung Company have promised to make this real. That means according to the concept of the Samsung Galaxy S9 will bend and twist however you want it to, without breaking any components. That’s welcome news for people who routinely sit on their phones. You will even not get worried about its size as it will fit in your pocket no matter the size.. A metallic unibody with smooth edges will protect the Samsung’s inner mechanisms from water and other debris. The body will also be built to improve grip compared to other Samsung phones.. The unibody, together with the glass technology, gives the Samsung galaxy S9 an entire hour underwater without shorting out. However, it is rumored the phone cannot go deeper than 20 meters.. Every Samsung user expects a lot from upcoming Samsung galaxy s9. We are hearing a number of rumors about Galaxy s9. But Samsung has not announced any information officially till now.There are few Samsung Galaxy S9 Specifications are detailed below.. The Galaxy S9 dual cameras will let you record every moment with outstanding clarity. The rear camera will handle up to 21 megapixels (although some rumors have the camera at 31 megapixels), while the front-facing camera will capture images with its 13-megapixel lens.. The cameras also enjoy support from Samsung’s imaging software to recognize faces and smiles. Samsung will launch different quality and feature in Galaxy s9’s Camera. Also, each of the cameras come equipped with a dedicated flash-diode allowing you to take stunning images in the darkest of places.. The Samsung Galaxy s9 dual cameras will allow users to video chat or conference, and it is rumored that users can unlock their Samsung galaxy s9 by looking into one of the cameras. Samsung’s facial recognition technology should suffice to make such a feature possible.. First up, you can expect Samsung to cram a 4K video in the Samsung galaxy s9. Owners of the Samsung Galaxy S9 will be able to record and play 4K videos on their Samsung device. 4K videos are the latest in video rendering technology. The name 4K comes from the technological feat of being able to display 4k pixels horizontally, giving you the best video quality on the planet. This is a neat little feature, but what would be neater is Samsung making the phone 3D ready. That would make the Samsung galaxy s9 the best mobile as well as a well-rounded entertainment hub.. The 4K video capability will be complemented by a large display screen capable of clearly displaying 4K videos galaxy S9. The biggest challenge for Samsung is not the screen, though; it is implementing a hardware architecture that will not choke under a load of 4K videos.. Everything from the motherboard to the processor needs to work hand in hand to display 4K videos. That means the battery will face a stern test, and the Samsung galaxy s9 might have a bigger footprint compared to other Galaxy offerings.. All these doodads wouldn’t mean much without a capable battery behind the scene. The Samsung galaxy s9 will run a powerhouse of a battery. The expected 5, 000mAH gives the S9 approximately 1, 000 hours of standby time, 47 hours of talk time, 125 hours of audio playing, 11 hours of video play and 11 hours of continuous web browsing.. There are very few phones out there equipped with a 5, 000mAH battery, but the few that have such batteries give out such numbers.. As noted earlier, the hardware required to make the Samsung galaxy s9 features are capable of the listed above demands a lot of juice. Anything short of a 5, 000mAH battery won’t cut it here. In fact, there is few Samsung galaxy s9. rumors in which it might go with a 6, 500mAH to make sure nothing is underpowered.. Everyone is quite confident Samsung will pull this off, what people are asking is, will the battery on the S9 spontaneously combust like it did on the S8? All likelihood points to the fact that Samsung has worked out the issue.. Interesting Facts about Galaxy S9 that You Probably Don’t Know. It’s pretty clear the Samsung galaxy s9 is designed to be a powerhouse. To complete the image, Samsung is expected to cram a Qualcomm Snapdragon 830 processor. If you are familiar with mobile processors, you might know the predecessor of the Snapdragon 830, the Snapdragon 810, was a bit of a letdown. Qualcomm heard the boos and made up for everything with the 830.. It’s based on a 10nm chip, making it the first processor to use that architecture. Qualcomm’s homegrown Kyro cores on Snapdragon 830 will drive performance up while lowering power drain. The processor can support up to 8GB of RAM in Samsung galaxy s9.. The processor will be paired with an Adreno 540 GPU, essentially turning the Samsung galaxy s9 into the mainframe of smartphones. The CPU and GPU combo will let the S9 run the most demanding apps and games without breaking a sweat because of the ample 6GB of RAM at its disposal.. We expect at least 128GBs of internal storage on the Samsung galaxy s9 , with the option of add more capacity via a MicroSD. However, the internal memory should be enough for most people, unless you plan on carrying tons of videos on the Samsung galaxy s9. Galaxy S9’s board supports a maximum of 256GB, so you cannot carry your entire video collection on it.. All that hardware will be managed by Android 8.0 which is yet to be released or named. If the current Android operating system, Nougat, is anything to go by, then Android 8.0 will be pretty amazing. Nougat supports multitasking meaning you can run many apps side by side.. A fingerprint scanner is definitely a must on the Samsung Galaxy S9. However, as mentioned earlier, there’s a very high chance that the device cameras will be capable of more than just taking pictures. We expect an iris scanner on the Samsung galaxy s9 making it even more secure. You can look away important files in your file and use your eyes to access them.. It’s no doubt that the Samsung galaxy s9 will not be vulnerable to the Dirty Cow attack that’s thought to affect all versions of Android phones. Dirty Cow is the name given to a recently discovered flaw that affects Android and Linux systems. The Dirty Cow vulnerability allows users to easily root a device with a few lines of code.. That’s not the biggest concern, though. A malicious person can easily hide the Dirty Cow in an app and use it to snoop around devices.. The Samsung users are excited to know about price of galaxy S9 and Samsung galaxy s9 edge. And they will be happy to know is Samsung Galaxy s9 & Galaxy S9 edge will not too expensive than Galaxy s8 &. There will be little bit price difference between Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Samsung galaxy s9 Series. S8 competing in the same bracket as the HTC 11, Xiaomi Mi 6 and te OnePlus 4.. The expected Country wise price list of Samsung Galaxy s9 is given below. November 14, 2017 By Mohit Ranjan Leave a Comment. Top 5 Features of Galaxy S9.

The Samsung Galaxy S9 And Note 9 Will Continue Samsung’s Comeback In 2018. Samsung is making its way back to the top.. Samsung is making its way back to the top.. The year 2016 was a bleak year for Samsung. Things started off well with the release of the Galaxy S7, but then they quickly went downhill with the Galaxy Note 7 — a device that received excellent reviews, but was recalled (twice) due to reported explosions. It ended up that both recalls were due to battery issues.. Samsung dusted itself off in 2017 and came out with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, which were hugely successful. Then, they further improved their image with the Galaxy Note 8, which earned excellent reviews. CNET gave Samsung’s comeback device four-and-a-half stars.. “The Galaxy Note 8 tops Samsung’s already excellent S8 and S8 Plus with dual cameras and a boatload of stylus tricks. It’s the most feature-rich Android phone you can buy.”. TechRadar also gave the Note 8 four-and-a-half stars and praised its screen, improvements in speed, and battery life. Though the Note 8 isn’t selling in multitudes like the iPhone X, it is still considered the best smartphone of the year by many media sources.. Samsung is expected to continue their comeback, and it’s possible they could possibly take over Apple as the most successful smartphone company once again in 2018. According to Forbes , the new flagship smartphone will have even thinner bezels than the Galaxy S8 (if that’s even possible), a dual camera, a fingerprint scanner that’s not directly next to the camera (this caused a lot of controversy with the S8), and it will likely have the same screen resolution as the S8.. Many think the bezels on the Galaxy S8 are already too thin. However, as BGR explains, the Galaxy S9 may come in three different versions. One would be the regular S9, the other would be the S9+, and Samsung will also introduce a 5-inch mini version of its new flagship smartphone. Still, many commenters after the article aren’t impressed.. “But i want one with a bezel so i can hold the damn phone without touching the screen!” said Zalamnov, echoing a sentiment that many express with Samsung’s new smartphones.. “Curved infinity display – that’s what bothers me, I need flat screen like on other phones,” said Dacha.. Still, there is a lot of excitement for the Galaxy S9 on Twitter.. This Samsung Galaxy S9 concept is so amazing that it can put the iPhone X to. shame https://t.co/9G1AmO3FiK pic.twitter.com/2vyuo7IR2U. — Android Marvel (@andromarvel) September 26, 2017. I can't wait for samsung galaxy s9 to be out next year. — Sabrina (@sabrinamula) December 16, 2017. Then, there’s the Galaxy Note 9, which is likely to be released late next summer. There haven’t been many rumors about the new phablet yet, but it is highly anticipated. Some hope for stereo speakers, and others hope the device would be slightly smaller since the Galaxy Note 8 is gigantic, even though it can still fit in your pocket.. Besides innovation in smartphones, 2018 could also see Samsung release a standalone VR device that doesn’t use a phone as its screen. There are also rumors of some type of Samsung Galaxy device that has a screen that actually folds. Whatever Samsung comes up with, expect a lot of hype, excitement, and (especially) sales.. ‘The Walking Dead’ Season 8, Episode 10 Spoilers: Simon Makes A Risky Move In ‘The Lost And The Plunderers’.

It's finally here – the Samsung Galaxy S9 has been officially unveiled on stage at the brand's MWC 2018 press conference, alongside the Galaxy S9 Plus .. To celebrate, we've put together a guide to everything you need to know about the brand new flagship phone. That includes the spec, design, release date, the latest on pricing and much, much more.. We've got photos of the handset so you can see what it looks like, and we break down the key new features, including the new and improved rear camera, AR Emoji on the front camera and improvements to Samsung's Bixby virtual assistant.. Scroll down to get a full picture of what the phone looks like, split across various categories.. Display resolution : QHD+ (1440 x 2960) Display size : 5.8-inch, 18.5:9 ratio Display tech : Super AMOLED Chipset : Exynos 9810/Snapdragon 845 RAM : 4GB Storage : 64GB Rear camera : 12MP Front camera : 8MP Battery : 3,000mAh Software: Android 8 Oreo. It's official: we now know everything we need to about the new phone. Keep scrolling down this page to learn all about the handset.. We know the Galaxy S9 will cost £739 or $719.99 (about AU$1310) SIM-free directly from Samsung, but exact pricing for other markets is currently unclear. In the UK, that's a huge price jump over last year's handset, which cost £689 at launch, and it's the same price as the reports our sources told us before it was made official.. The Samsung Galaxy S9 launch date is today (February 25) and the phone will be up for pre-order in the next few hours or days depending on where you live. You'll be able to get the phone in your hands from March 16.. The Samsung Galaxy S9 was officially unveiled on stage at MWC 2018, but it won't be on shop shelves just yet.. If you want to buy the Galaxy S9, you'll be able to pre-order it from 7PM GMT on February 25 in the UK – that's right after the launch event. Those in the US have to wait until March 1 for pre-orders to open, and we've yet to learn about the timing for the rest of the world.. As for when you'll actually get the phone, the Galaxy S9 release date is set for March 16 globally. You may want to pre-order to ensure you get your device on that date, but everyone will be able to buy it from March 16 2018. But how much is it going to set you back?. Samsung has confirmed the price of the Galaxy S9 in the UK at £739 and $719.99 in the US (about AU$1310). Right now we don't know pricing for Australia, but we'll update this piece once we hear more.. In the UK, we've only currently heard of contract pricing from EE. Deals there start at £53 a month with an upfront cost of £150. That gets you 4GB of data every month as well as unlimited minutes and texts.. In the UK, it's a 7% price increase over last year, but a massive 25% bump from the price of the Galaxy S7 .. We also don't know any specific US or UK contract pricing yet, but we'll be sure to update here when we hear from the major networks and carriers on both sides of the Atlantic.. The Samsung Galaxy S9 doesn't offer any major improvements over the display on the Galaxy S8 – there's sadly no in-screen fingerprint scanner here, like on the Vivo X20 Plus UD – but it still offers some high-end specs.. It's a 5.8-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 1440 x 2960. That equals 567 pixels per inch, which should allow for a super-crisp and clear picture for the high-end flagship device.. Again it has a screen ratio of 18.5:9, with slightly slimmer bezels at the top and bottom of the screen to allow for the same size screen in a smaller body than the Galaxy S8.. If you know the Infinity Display design of the Galaxy S8, you'll recognize a lot of what the Galaxy S9 is trying to do. There aren't any major differences, but instead Samsung has opted to try and improve things with a few slight tweaks.. There's still a glass back, a rounded display on the front and slim bezels, with the aim of merging the screen almost seamlessly with the body of the handset.. Samsung claims the design improvements for the phone include the iris scanner hole being hidden, as well as less bezel at the top and bottom of the display.. is now also a touch darker when off, with Samsung presumably thinking this will obscure the lines that bit more between the body and the display, to make the S9 look even more futuristic than past devices.. One of our biggest criticisms of the Galaxy S8 was the strange placement of the fingerprint scanner on the rear of the phone right next to the camera, and Samsung has moved the sensor on this phone.. Now it sits below the camera, and there's quite a distance between the two, so you won't mistakenly put your fingers all over the shooter.. Unlike on some rival products, there's still a 3.5mm headphone jack on the Samsung Galaxy S9, on the bottom edge of the phone on the left-hand side. Next to that sits the USB-C slot for charging and data transfer, and one of the phone's two speakers.. The other speaker is on the top of the phone, and Samsung says these new speakers will allow the S9 to be 1.5 times louder than the Galaxy S8. If audio is a big deal for you, you'll be pleased to hear the phone also features Dolby ATMOS surround sound technology.. If you get this phone wet, don't panic, as Samsung has opted for IP68 waterproofing , so the Galaxy S9 can handle the odd drop in a puddle without immediately flooding the internals.. As for color options, you'll be able to buy the phone in Midnight Black, Coral Blue and Lilac Purple in most territories. Those in the US or UK won't get the Titanium Gray version, but some other countries will.. The Galaxy S9 only features a single lens on the rear of the phone, but Samsung has packed in lots of improvements in its effort to 'reimagine' the phone camera.. There's a 12MP rear sensor with optical image stabilization, and a lot of the other features we've come to expect from high-end Samsung devices.. One of the biggest upgrades is new dual-aperture technology, with the camera automatically adjusting the aperture depending on the scene you're shooting, much like the human eye adapts to changing light.. So if you're shooting something brighter than 100 lux (which is usually daylight) it'll automatically adjust to f/2.4 aperture, and if it's darker than that the camera will opt for the f/1.5 aperture.. F/1.5 is the widest ever aperture in a smartphone, and Samsung claims it should enable you to capture images with more color and detail, and much less noise in low light conditions.. The slow-mo features of the rear shooter have also been improved so you can now shoot at 960 frames per second, which is four times slower than the Galaxy S8 and meets the industry standard set by Sony phones.. This mode also uses something called automatic motion detect, which will automatically begin to record when the camera detects movement, so it should make it easier to only record the relevant moments in slow motion.. On the front of the phone there's an 8MP shooter with an f/1.7 aperture. This camera also plays into the facial recognition technology you can read about in the other features section at the bottom of this page.. Much like the Galaxy S8, there's a 3,000mAh cell inside the Galaxy S9 to power it along on a daily basis. Exactly how long this will last is currently unclear, but it's expected that the new processing tech inside both versions of the phone will make it a touch more efficient than the Galaxy S8 was.. There's wireless charging technology here again too, so you'll be able to use a variety of different pads to charge up your phone without plugging it in. Plus there's fast charging on offer here as well, but you'll need to use the official charger to get the full power into your phone in the minimum amount of time.. This is the chance for Samsung to show off its top processing power inside the Galaxy S9. For that opportunity the company has opted to follow a similar scheme to recent years where different countries get different chipsets.. If you live in the US, you'll get a version of the phone packing a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset, and the S9 is set to be one of the first phones to get this technology from Qualcomm.. Those in the UK (and a lot of other markets) are set to get a version of the phone packing the Exynos 9810 chipset, which is created in-house at Samsung.. Exactly which version of the phone will be more powerful remains to be seen, but if it's like recent years both versions of the phones will be a similar level when it comes to raw processing power.. There's also only 4GB of RAM in each version of the phone, for 6GB you'll have to opt for the Galaxy S9 Plus. As for storage, the Galaxy S9 only comes with 64GB of onboard space, but you can add in microSD cards for up to 256GB of extra space.. Samsung says it believes people are communicating more with images than ever before, so it has made its own feature called AR emoji. AR stands for augmented reality and this feature uses the front camera to take a selfie and make an emoji based on your looks.. It works in a similar way to The Sims, where you make an image that represents you and can be customized. It uses facial recognition and can recognize over 18 different expressions.. It's a similar idea to the Animoji feature available on the iPhone X , but this allows you to make your own character and give it different hair colors, dress senses, 12 different clothing options and choose from 7 pairs of glasses.. You can move your face to make silly videos, but you can also choose one of 18 different emotions pre-built into the app so you don't always need to pull a stupid face into your phone to be able to send one.. Samsung is also bringing big improvements to its Bixby Vision project too. When you're in the camera app you can tap the Bixby option to access a variety of different new features, including tracking the place you're in (it provides the name and details of where you are) or pointing it at food, at which point it will try to work out what it is and even estimate the calories.. There's another feature called Live Translation that allows you to put the camera over a menu or text and auto translate it. You'll need an internet connection and to wait a few moments for this to work, but it's an interesting addition that may come in useful when you're traveling.. Plus, Bixby Vision offers an enhanced beauty mode, so you can change the look of your selfies too..
