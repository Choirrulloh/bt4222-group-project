So that immediately makes it far worse than the V20? The s8 has a non-removable battery and is it garbage? The Q8 is everything the V20 is missing in terms of Hardware and Software Faults, including the bootloop issue.. If this doesn't bootloop like the v20 it seems like a decent deal.. Why don't they sell it world over not a few country no meaning saying what's wrong with it if u can't buy it.

Visual and Audio Features in a Durable IP67 Device. SEOUL , July 24, 2017 — LG Electronics (LG) today announced the arrival of the new Q8, LG’s latest powerful, stylish and durable smartphone that inherits core features from LG’s flagship lineup – in particular the “prosumer” V series – but designed for one-handed usage and extreme portability. As the second device announced in LG’s newest Q series, the Q8 delivers Hi-Fi sound, prosumer quality video and photo capabilities and water and dust resistance in a compact package.. The Q8 builds on LG’s powerful heritage in photography and videography, with features such as Steady Record 2.0 for smooth, judder-free video recording. Like many of LG’s high-end smartphones, the Q8 incorporates dual lenses on the back to capture broad interiors and sweeping vistas as well as a wide angle camera on the front for truly breathtaking wefies. With a 120-degree wide angle lens and 83-degree standard lens up front and a 135-degree wide angle, 78-degree standard lens on the back, the LG Q8 is truly a shutterbug’s dream come true.. LG Q8 takes audio to the next level with Hi-Fi Recording which utilizes two high AOP (Acoustic Overload Point) microphones to minimize crowd and background noise when recording outdoor events. Audio files are saved in 24-bit / 48 kHz LPCM (Linear Pulse Code Modulation) format – the same format used in the movie industry. As one of the first smartphone manufacturer to offer manual video mode in its devices, LG bestowed the Q8 with the ability to tweak every aspect of the recording process.. The Q8 raises the ante in smartphone audio with Hi-Fi Quad DAC from ESS Technology, a world leader in high-performance audio products. The Quad DAC in the LG Q8 cuts white noise by 50 percent and up-samples music files to Hi-Fi quality to deliver crisp, lush sound uncharacteristic of smartphone audio systems. And the HD Audio Recorder captures studio-quality audio via 24-bit / 192 kHz in lossless FLAC format. For customers who want complete control over the audio recording experience, Studio Mode in the phone’s HD Audio Recorder was designed with exactly such users in mind.. The customizable always-on Second Screen on top of the main display offers users a handy shortcut to contacts, tools and apps. For gaming aficionados, the next-generation, Vulkan-compatible 3D graphics engine brings the most powerful and resource-hungry mobile games to life in vibrant colors.. What’s more, LG Q8 boasts water and dust resistance, just in time for summer. Rated IP67, it can be safely immersed in up to one meter of water for up to 30 minutes, meaning that the Q8 will resist splashes, drops on the beach and other possible hazards. The phone is protected by a metal frame with rounded corners that absorbs the majority of shocks and vibration.. “The LG Q8 is a welcome member to our newest Q line of smartphones that addresses the needs of customers who want the best content creation device without paying for extra features they don’t want or need,” said Juno Cho, president of LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company. “The Q8 gets much of its DNA from past V devices but is designed for one-handed use and ease of portability.”. The LG Q8 will initially be available in key European markets starting this week followed by markets in Asia next month.. *Specification may vary depending on the particular market..

The LG Q8 just popped up on the company's Italian site , detailing a new phone that will seem startlingly like the LG V20. That's actually what's likable about it.. The LG V20 was a good phone, but it wasn’t perfect. It had great audio, a dual-lens cameras ready for wide-angle photos, and a removable battery to its credit.. But it was a phablet-sized phone, which makes it a nonstarter for some people, and it fell behind in performance as soon as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 chipset came out.. What the LG Q8 does isn’t much different than the V20. It’s got most of the same blood and guts as the V20, running Android Nougat 7.0 on the same Snapdragon 820.. Both feature a dual-camera system on the rear, a 1440p display the front, and a special marquee screen at the top for shortcuts and extra on-screen buttons.. The LG Q8 does have some differences, though. Among the more notable are its IP67 rating against water and dust, letting it sit at the bottom of a meter of water for up to 30 minutes.. It’s also more pocket friendly, with a shorter and narrower frame and a 5.2-inch display. It’s likely to be priced more favorably than the V20 as well.. The V20 was by all means a flagship phablet when it launched. And with flagship status comes flagship prices. It launched in late 2016 with a price tag of $799 for an unlocked model, topping even the base iPhone 7 Plus price.. Since the the LG Q8 is carrying around a chipset that’s older than all the other big phones hitting the market, like the OnePlus 5 and Samsung Galaxy S8 with their Snapdragon 835 chipsets, it would be a misstep to try pricing the Q8 in the same ballpark.. That means mobile users will likely be able to get their hands on this scaled-down version of the LG V20 at a nice budget price.. While the LG Q8 doesn’t gain much favor from its chipset or internal storage limited to 32GB, it still offers a lot that budget tend to miss.. Dual-camera systems aren’t showing up on many cheap phones yet, and 2,560x1440 pixel displays are especially rare at low prices. For music lovers, it even has a special DAC for high quality audio playback, and can record 24-bit/192KHz audio in the FLAC format.. You won’t find many phones that do what the Q8 will do in the sub-$600 category.. Though it’s not certain the Q8 will hit those low prices, it seems likely that LG will use the Q8 to introduce the premium features of the V20 to a wider audience..

That's actually what's likable about it. The LG V20 was a good phone, but it wasn’t perfect. It had great audio, a dual-lens cameras ready for wide-angle photos, and a removable battery to its credit. But it was a phablet-sized phone, which makes it a nonstarter for some people, and it fell behind in performance as soon as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 chipset came out. What the LG Q8 does isn’t much different than the V20. It’s got most of the same blood and guts as the V20, running Android Nougat 7.0 on the same Snapdragon 820. Both feature a dual-camera system on the rear, a 1440p display the front, and a special marquee screen at the top for shortcuts and extra on-screen buttons. The LG Q8 does have some differences, though. Among the more notable are its IP67 rating against water and dust, letting it sit at the bottom of a meter of water for up to 30 minutes. It’s also more pocket friendly, with a shorter and narrower frame and a 5.2-inch display. It’s likely to be priced more favorably than the V20 as well. LG G6 The LG G6 fetures a FullVision display with curved corners and an unusual resolution of 1440 x 2880 pixels (QHD+), a diagonal size of 5.7 inches, and 18:9 aspect ratio. LG's media player converts any media content on the phone to the 18:9 ratio. Protection is ensured by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3. This is the first smartphone in the world to support HDR 10 and DolbyVision, which are some of the highest standards for visual quality in high-end smart TVs currently. "Big screen experience that fits in your hand". It sits on top of a 7.9 mm thin aluminum alloy body with a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on the back. the device is dust-proof and water splashes resistant. Despite the big screen, the body preserves a comfortable to handle size, perfect for one-hand usage. This design philosophy will trickle down to all future LG smartphones. It has been already largely discussed that won't be able to get the latest Qualcomm chipset, so indeed, it is based on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 MSM8996 Pro chipset. The latter packs a 2.35GHz quad-core Kryo CPU and an Adreno 530 GPU coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The model is powered by a 3300 mAh battery with wireless charging support and Quick Charge 3.0. On the rear packs two 13MP cameras - the secondary rear camera having a 120-degree wide-angle lens with an f/1.8 aperture and 2x optical zoom. The first packs an f/2.4 lens. They are aided by a dual LED flash, PDAF and laser autofocus. The front-facing shooter has a 100-degree wide-angle lens with an f/2.2 aperture and a 5MP sensor. The lenses of the two cameras are protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 4. For improved audio experience there's a Hi-Fi Quad DAC amp. The smartphone runs Android 7.1 Nougat with LG's latest UX 6.0 and supports 4G LTE Cat. dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou. It is equipped with a USB Type-C 3.1 port with OTG support as well as an IR blaster. NFC and VoLTE support are on board as well along with a rounded fingerprint sensor placed on the back below the cameras. The device is available in white, black and grey colors. It will be officially launched on March 10 worldwide, except for the the US, where it will arrive in the beginning of April.. When autoplay is enabled, a suggested video will automatically play next.. LG Q6 vs LG Q8 Specs, Features And CAMERA. [리뷰] LG 'Q8', '내 손안에 들어오는 가벼운 스마트폰' (LG, Q시리즈, 컴팩트 스마트폰).

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Q8 has been priced at KRW 616,000 (roughly Rs. LG Q8 comes with a secondary display, just like the LG V20. The smartphone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC. LG launched its Q8 smartphone, the smaller variant of the V20, in Italy last month and while the company didn't reveal the pricing of the handset at the time, it has done so with the smartphone's South Korea launch. On Thursday, LG launched the Q8 in South Korea at a price of KRW 616,000 (roughly Rs. 34,950) and announced that the smartphone will be made available in Urban Titan and Sweet Pink colours in the country.. To recall, the LG Q8 is essentially a mini variant of the LG V20 that features a smaller screen. The highlight features on the new Q-Series smartphone include its secondary screen and a dual camera setup at the back.. The LG Q8 runs on the company's LG UX 5.0 based on Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box and sports a 5.2-inch QHD (1440x2560 pixels) IPS LCD display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 on top. The aforementioned secondary display comes with a resolution of 160x1040 pixels. The smartphone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC coupled with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. It comes with 32GB of built-in storage, which is further expandable via microSD card (up to 2TB).. In terms of optics, the rear dual camera setup on the LG Q8 consists of a 13-megapixel sensor with f/1.8 aperture and an 8-megapixel sensor with f/2.4 aperture. At the front, there is a 5-megapixel camera with f/1.9 aperture. The smartphone houses a 3000mAh battery and the connectivity options offered by the handset include Wi-Fi802.11a/b/g/n/ac dual-band, NFC, Bluetooth v4.2, and USB Type-C.. LG Q8 comes with IP67 certification, which effectively means that it will be able to handle occasional splashes of water, if you use it around pool or on a beach. There's a fingerprint sensor at the back of the smartphone, which is placed right below the dual camera setup.. Notably, the LG Q8 also features an infrared emitter. Much like recent LG high-end smartphones, the LG Q8 also comes with 32-bit quad DAC support. It measures 149x71.9x7.9mm and weighs 146 grams..

If you liked LG's innovative dual screen phones but missed them on this year's new crop of phones, LG's giving you a little throw back with the Q8, which has the same dual screen as the V20.. If you have been following LG's smartphone moves for the past year, you are probably well-aware of the LG V20. It is an excellent device overall but has never really caught on compared to other mobile phones launched at the same time. It has a dual-screen feature that gave you an additional screen above the main display that was always on and let you do interesting things, such as switching apps like the taskbar and so forth. If you have always wanted that phone but wanted a smaller, more modern design, then LG has the phone for you: the LG Q8 .. The Q8 fits into the line of recently released mid-range Q Series phones, the LG Q6 , the LG Q6+ and the LG Q6α. Whereas the latter group of phones are clearly a new 2017 batch of models with LG's new design language and updated internals like the Snapdragon 660 OS, the Q8 still uses last year's Snapdragon 820. While still an older flagship chip in its own right, it is more appropriate to slot the Q8 along with the Q6 and its brethren. For those who are familiar with LG's releases internationally, the Q8 is a dead ringer for the LG V34, a Japan-only model which was basically a smaller LG V20.. That is what the Q8 is: a phone with LG's 2016 design language sporting a 5.2-inch Quad HD display, a secondary panel right above the main display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, 4GB of RAM, a dual camera setup with a 13-megapixel and 8-megapixel pair of sensors, a 3,000mAh battery, and IP67 water resistance. It still comes with Android 7.0 Nougat but for all intents and purposes, this is last year's flagship class model offered to you in a mid-range series of phones.. For those who think the LG G6 may be a little too expensive, this phone may be godsent. Getting last year's flagship for a bargain price is not a bad deal, and the Q8 looks like it will be selling a little below the flagship G-Series.
