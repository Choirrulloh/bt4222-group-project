SIM Only SIM Samsung Galaxy S7 black Apple iPhone 7 32GB black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge black Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus black Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus rose pink Apple iPhone 7 32GB rose gold Samsung Galaxy S8 black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge gold Samsung Galaxy S8 grey. A cheap phone that should prove POPular. The Alcatel Pop 4 is an extremely affordable smartphone that has a pleasing design, Android OS and 4G internet connectivity.. The 5” Full HD (1280 x 720 pixels) black crystal display is fully laminated and this means that a great viewing experience awaits. Laminated display do not have an air gap between the display and the glass and this reduces internal reflections, to give a clear viewing experience.. With reduced reflection, owners will be able to enjoy the vibrancy of 16.7m colours, while an oleophobic coating reduces fingerprints, which typically ruin the look of the phone when the display is off.. The design of the Alcatel Pop 4 is pretty standard with a slim body of 7.99mm, a plastic casing and a weight of 156g. However, there is a slight curve to the body and a nice chrome coloured speaker grill and trim around the main camera lens. These are nice touches that improve the overall look substantially.. Inside, a quad-core 1.1GHz processor with 1GB of RAM powers the experience and this is strong enough for most operations, but serious gamers may want to look elsewhere.. Alcatel Pop 4 vs Lenovo K5 Vibe. Just a few days ago we took a look at another affordable smartphone, the Lenovo K5 Vibe. Fitting into the same pricing bracket for contract customers and just marginally more expensive SIM free, the Lenovo K5 Vibe boasts a 1.4GHz processor with 2GB of RAM, making it a more appealing option for serious gamers.. The Lenovo K5 Vibe also has an aluminium frame and 13MP main camera.. It is pretty easy to get started with the Alcatel Pop 4. The Android OS offers PIN, password and pattern lock-screen security and if you use the Chrome browser, then your bookmarks and passwords will sync automatically.. The 8GB internal memory is a little stingy, even for a budget phone, but there is a 32GB microSD card slot, which offers a cheap way to boost the memory.. The Alcatel Pop 4 is powered by the Android Marshmallow operating system and this gives a rich and intuitive experience. Natural dialogue has become even more powerful with Marshmallow, letting owners make Google Voice Searches, set voice reminders with the Google Assistant and even use voice typing to creating emails or messages.. The 4G internet connectivity is fast and very handy when the phone is not connected to a home’s Wi-Fi or local hotspot. GPS and Google Maps will take care of any navigational needs.. Now on Tap also forms part of the Android OS and can be activated on any screen with a long press of the home key. Once activated, this feature scans the information on the screen and a pop up then gives links to related content. These could be links to YouTube videos, Maps if a place is mentioned or reviews if a hotel or restaurant is mentioned somewhere on the screen.. The Alcatel Pop 4 has an 8MP camera with a LED flash. HDR can be used to correctly expose images that have both light and dark detail within them, while a video zoom improves the video recording experience.. The 5MP selfie camera has a wide angle 84 degrees lens and this is useful for group selfies or capturing a selfie next to landmarks.. The 2,500mAh battery is a pleasant inclusion to find and this works well with the already power efficient Marshmallow OS. The battery can keep the phone in standby for up to. 420 hours, whereas people who love media can enjoy up to 5 hours of video playback.. To fully recharge the Alcatel Pop 4 from empty, takes just 4 hours.. Final thoughts: Earlier in this Alcatel Pop 4 review we compared this phone to the Lenovo K5 Vibe. And, while the Lenovo may have slightly better hardware, the Alcatel has the latest version of Android. For non-gamers, this will probably be enough to convince them that the Alcatel Pop 4 is the right phone for them..

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 8 GB + MicroSD. Too little RAM memory (1 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (294 ppi). The Alcatel POP 4 has a 5-inch, 720 x 1280 resolution display, which brings its pixel density to 293 PPI — not ideal, but should be crisp enough not to cause annoyances. It has a quad-core, 1.1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 under its hood, paired with the modest 1 GB of RAM. Its internal memory is at a measly 8 GB, but can, thankfully, be expanded via microSD card of up to 32 GB. Its battery is generous for its specs, listed at 2,500 mAh. It has an 8 MP main camera and, as mentioned, a wide-angle (84.4-degree) 5 MP, LED-assisted selfie snapper. Impressively enough, the camera software also supports HDR shooting.. Dimensions: 5.54 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches (140.7 x 71.4 x 7.99 mm). Weight: 5.50 oz (156 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Oleophobic coating, Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (30 fps), 1280x720 (720p HD) (30 fps). System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 12.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 17.5 days (420 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 9.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 17.5 days (420 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Stand-by time (4G): 16.7 days (400 hours) the average is 23 days (549 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 7, 8, 20, 28. Data: LTE Cat 4 (150/50 Mbit/s), HSDPA+ (4G) 42.2 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s. Accelerometer, Compass, Hall (for flip covers). Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 22 Feb 2016. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Tom's Guide > Forum > Android Smartphones > Alcatel pop 4 system storage >. Last response: August 4, 2016 1:15 PM in Android Smartphones. Hi, I've just bought an Alcatel pop 4 with 8gb of internal memory. I have no photos or videos or music stored in the phone, however the system storage claims to be 5gb. I've got almost 3gb worth of apps stored in the internal memory (they're all the ones I can't move to the SD card for some reason). So I've got problems with reaching a limit on internal memory. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Nothing you can do aside from deleting some programs. The 8 GB of memory includes the storage the Android operating system used as well as all the pre-loaded programs on the device which is why you only see 5 GB free. If you root the device, you can remove some of the programs, but you do that at your own risk. There are other ways also if you do a bit of online looking around.. I've got a similar Problem with my Pop 4. I expanded the memory with a 16GB SD card, as I download many apps and enjoy taking many photos. I integrated the SD card as internal storage, however, all of the photos and videos remain on internal memory, with no sign as to how to transfer them to SD card (I've tried many things). Along with this, my phone constantly tells me my storage is full, and disables me from updating apps and download games despite having roughly 300 mega bytes of storage left, which would easily fit the small update, and even though they would download straight to the SD card anyway, that is if it allowed me to. It's very frustrating, and I would appreciate a solution (if there is one). Can't find your answer ? Ask !. Hello to all that have just bought this phone. I had the same issue with purchasing and then realising that the memory is only around 1gb after system storage and google updates. I've got a few tips that could help though... First of all do go out and buy a microsd card (16gb £8 in whsmith) and install as an internal memory. really easy to do, the phone guides you through and it only takes a few minutes... Get rid of google chrome (starts at around 70mb but eventually jumps up to 200mb over time). go to settings>storage and usb>internal storage>apps scroll to chrome and you can 'force stop' by clicking on the top right 'i' button...this resets back to factory settings; and then disable the app. Now install 'opera mini' from the play store. It gets saved on your new internal storage. You can download messenger and that gets save onto your new internal memory too. Then go back to settings>storage and usb>internal storage>apps and scroll to other google apps you don't need... for example youtube (just view on your browser), google play music, google drive, facebook.appmanager, google play movies. follow the instructions above and it will get rid of a whole load off your system storage to increase your ram. I also got rid of gmail and use the onboard email client that came with the phone. Can't find your answer ? Ask !.

Alcatel Pop 4 review: Promises much but fails to deliver. facebook twitter google+ email Comments. A £70 smartphone with great potential but one that ultimately falls short. Alcatel Pop 4 review: Build quality Alcatel Pop 4 review: Display Alcatel Pop 4 review: Software Alcatel Pop 4 review: Performance Alcatel Pop 4 review: Camera Alcatel Pop 4 review: Verdict. Cheap Android phones don’t always have to be awful. In fact, phones such as the Alcatel Pixi 4, the Vodafone Smart Prime 7 and the Alcatel Pop 4 I’m reviewing here, prove that you can get by these days with a phone costing a fraction the price of a flagship.. Where once upon a time sub-£100 smartphones were the watchword for small handsets with poor displays and terrible performance, those days seem consigned to the past. The Alcatel Pop 4, for instance, has a 5in HD (720 x 1,280) screen, a quad-core processor, a 256GB microSD card expansion slot and a removable battery, is 4G-enabled and comes with Android 6 Marshmallow. And yet it costs a mere £70.. There's plenty of competition in this price bracket, though, such as the Pop 4 looks amazingly good value at £70 , but it’s up against the similarly priced Vodafone Smart Prime 7 and even Alcatel’s very own Pixi 4 (5), which is cheaper at £60. The phone can also be found on contract at Carphone Warehouse from £8.99 a month .. READ NEXT: Best budget phones to buy in 2017 .. Alcatel POP 4 UK SIM-Free Smartphone. No matter the improvement in quality of budget phones in recent times, there’s usually something that gives, and with the Pop 4 it’s build quality, which is a mixed bag. In the hand, I felt the phone wasn’t particularly comfortable to grip due to the slightly raised plastic lip that borders the front of the phone.. The phone is light, though, at a mere 134g, it’s pretty slim, measuring a mere 8mm from the glass at the front to the rear panel, and overall it’s a sleeker handset than the Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) .. Best budget smartphone 2018: The TOP cheap phones to buy in 2018. Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) review: How good can a £59 smartphone be?. Beneath the phone’s screen are three illuminated capacitive buttons, with the home button always remaining visible. I found the placement of its micro-USB port on the bottom-right-hand corner different from most smartphones on the market. You’ll find a volume rocker and power button on the right edge with a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top of the phone.. Around the back, the camera module protrudes a touch, which rather irritatingly means the phone rocks when used on a flat surface. On the positive side, you can remove the plastic rear cover, granting access to a removable 2,500mAh lithium-ion battery, microSD and micro-SIM slots.. READ NEXT: Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) review. Unlike the non-HD display of Pixi 4 (5) , the Pop 4 has an HD, 720 x 1,280 IPS screen. This gives it a pixel density of 294 pixels per inch (ppi) across its 5in diagonal, compared with the Pixi 4 (5)’s lowly 196ppi and it’s a difference you can see with the naked eye. Text in particular looks far sharper on the Pop 4’s display – a major step forwards.. The Pop 4’s screen is reasonably bright, too. I tested it at 414cd/m2, which means it’s good enough to be read comfortably in most outdoor conditions – aside from direct, bright sunlight – without having to shade it with your hand. Colour rendition isn’t quite so impressive, with 79.30% coverage of the sRGB colour gamut. In real-world use, this translates to a pretty good-looking screen, but one where the colours are a little dull and pale compared with the best smartphone screens in the business.. The contrast ratio is good, though. At maximum brightness it outputs a contrast ratio of 1,405:1 with an above-par 0.29cd/m2 black level. At this price, it’s an improvement over the Vodafone Smart Prime 7 ’s 1,060:1 contrast ratio and 0.45cd/m2 black level. And, due to having an IPS screen, viewing angles are excellent with no noticeable colour shift.. The Pop 4 comes with Android 6 Marshmallow out of the box. Even though it isn’t running Android 7 Nougat, I was pleased to see it come with a minimal number of preinstalled apps, ensuring a reasonably clean Android experience.. It does come with Alcatel’s OneTouch Launcher, however, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I’m a fan of its simplicity and ease of use – it gives the phone its own identity without riding roughshod over what makes Android great in the first place – and you can always change the launcher, by finding a free or paid one on the Play store .. A Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 chipset is found within the Pop 4, which is the very same chip found within the Vodafone Smart Prime 7. This budget phone isn’t aimed at gamers: its quad-core 1.1GHz Cortex-A7 processor, Adreno 304 GPU and 1GB of RAM provide a sluggish experience with advanced games.. In the Geekbench 4 benchmarks, the Pop 4’s single- and multi-core scores were disappointing, with respective scores of 315 and 762. In everyday use, I found performance equally poor, with a noticeable delay when switching between apps, jittery vertical scrolling in menus and web pages and slow, sluggish animations when returning to the phone’s homescreen.. Surprisingly, the Pop 4’s performance isn’t as good as the cheaper Alcatel Pixi 4 (5). That phone with its MediaTek processor felt much more responsive when I reviewed it and it had higher Geekbench 4 scores.. The Pop 4’s Adreno 304 GPU isn’t able to keep up with games either. An average frame rate of 3.8fps in the GFXBench Manhattan 3 onscreen benchmark indicates the Pop 4 will be able to play Candy Crush without too much trouble, but it will be unable to cope with graphically intense games, such as Asphalt 8: Airborne .. At this price point that’s not unusual; pretty much all sub-£100 phones perform like the Pop 4. And in any case, the phone’s limited storage, which stands at a miserly 8GB, will prevent you from installing anything too demanding.. As for battery life, that’s not much better. The Alcatel Pop 4 achieved 9hrs 32mins in our battery benchmark, which is an improvement over Pixi 4 (5)’s 8hrs 17mins but is still far behind the impressive 12hrs 55mins achieved by the Vodafone Smart Prime 7. On the plus side, the Pop 4’s 2,500mAh battery can be removed, which allows you to carry around a spare. or two for use in emergencies.. READ NEXT: Vodafone Smart Prime 7 review. The one area in which the Pop 4 is distinctly better than the Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) is the camera. The Pop 4 comes with rear-facing 8-megapixel and front 5-megapixel cameras and the results are respectable for a £70 smartphone especially in HDR mode, which brings out the finer details in images.. ^Road shot in HDR mode (better colour accuracy and more detail on the brickwork). In my test shots, I found the Pop 4 held its own in outdoor shots. If you want the best image quality you’ll need to shoot in HDR, as in standard mode images looked washed out and overexposed with inaccurate colours. However, shooting in HDR does require a steady hand and, due to its sluggish performance, the Pop 4 does take a few additional seconds to process HDR images.. ^Low-light indoor shot in Standard mode. ^Low-light indoor shot in HDR mode (more detail and accurate colour reproduction). I found its low-light performance poor, but this is to be expected with a phone at this price. Again, its HDR performance in low light brings out missing details and produces a much more pleasing image. I found its rear-facing flash added a blue hue to the image, making it look washed out, but its ability to light a very dark scene is useful.. ^Picture taken in low light, on Standard mode with flash enabled. The front-facing 5-megapixel camera also has a flash, which is welcome, but it doesn’t add an awful lot of illumination or improve the quality of images in low light, which tend to look pretty smeary and muddy. The video quality isn’t great either, with the Pop 4 only able to capture moving images at 720p and 30fps.. The Alcatel Pop 4 is a good budget smartphone, then, but isn’t the one I’d pick, and that’s mainly due to the strength of its immediate rivals.. The phone’s internals are virtually identical to the Vodafone Smart Prime 7 , and its performance very similar, but for a little extra the Prime 7 grants you much better battery life and a sleeker design. On the other hand, the cheaper Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) feels more responsive.. If the Pop 4 could combine the fluidity of the Pixi 4 (5) with the sleek design and battery life of the Smart Prime 7, then it would be a brilliant budget smartphone. As it is, however, it’s a mediocre also-ran.. Alcatel POP 4 UK SIM-Free Smartphone.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 16 GB + MicroSD. Too little RAM memory (1.5 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (267 ppi). The Alcatel POP 4+ features a 5.5-inch display, 1.5 GB of RAM, and 16 GB of internal storage, still expandable via an up to 32 GB microSD card. Its resolution is pinned at 720 x 1280 pixels, which means a 267 pixels-per-inch density - that's gonna look a bit jagged at close-to-medium viewing distances. Curiously enough, despite the fact that the POP 4+ is effectively a phablet with a bigger display and – consecutively – a bigger body, its battery remains at 2,500 mAh, same as POP 4's.. Dimensions: 5.94 x 3.03 x 0.31 inches (151 x 77 x 7.99 mm). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 18.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 21.9 days (525 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 15.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 20.8 days (500 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Stand-by time (4G): 20.0 days (480 hours) the average is 23 days (549 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. Data: LTE Cat 4 (150/50 Mbit/s), HSDPA+ (4G) 42.2 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s. Accelerometer, Compass, Hall (for flip covers). Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Alcatel’s Pop 4 is inexpensive, and while it’s no superstar, its general performance is acceptable for its asking price. Alcatel Pop 4 Screen size 5in Storage 8GB Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 Rear camera 8MP Front camera 5MP Battery 2500mAh Resolution 720x1280 Display density 401ppi RRP $119 Upsides: Why you’d want the Alcatel Pop 4 It’s affordable: Sure, this sounds like a one-note tune, but the key appeal of phones like the Pop 4 is that they’re remarkably inexpensive. You can buy cheaper handsets than the Pop 4, but not many with this feature set. Simple design: You won’t fool anybody that you’re rocking the latest and greatest premium phone, but at the same time the Pop 4 doesn’t commit too many offenses against reasonable taste and style. Its plastic frame is broadly reminiscent of Nokia/Microsoft’s many Lumia phones, and that’s no bad thing. Android 6.0 Marshmallow: Buy a cheap phone and you’re almost always looking at a phone running an older version of Android. The Pop 4 runs on Android 6.0 ("Marshmallow") and while we wouldn’t hold our breath for future updates, it’s a nice inclusion. Good battery life: The Pop 4’s processor isn’t particularly powerful, which has implications for its overall performance, but this, combined with Marshmallow’s gentle approach to battery usage means that the Pop 4 has very good battery life. Here’s how it compares against a range of more affordable handsets for battery life using Geekbench 3’s battery life test with screen dimming enabled: Handset Geekbench 3 Battery Test Duration Geekbench 3 Battery Score Samsung Galaxy J2 10:05:20 2689 Alcatel Pop 4 9:20:30 2490 LG Stylus DAB+ 8:11:40 3278 Alcatel Go Play 7:21:10 2941 Google Nexus 5X 7:14:20 4062 Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 5:42:00 2276 LG G4 5:27:50 3224 Huawei P8 Lite 4:39:40 2768 Downsides: Why you might not want the Alcatel Pop 4 Slow processor means low performance: Alcatel makes some noise about the quad-core processor in the Pop 4, but the reality is that you’re getting what you pay for, which is to say not much. General app performance is on the sluggish side, and this is borne out with the Pop 4’s Geekbench 3 scores. Here’s how it compares against a range of affordable phones: Handset Geekbench 3 Single Core (higher is better) Geekbench 3 Multi Core (higher is better) LG G4 1190 3313 Oppo R9 867 3303 Google Nexus 5X 1188 3198 Oppo R7s 696 2980 LG Stylus DAB+ 470 1418 Alcatel Go Play 453 1368 Samsung Galaxy J2 315 1044 Alcatel Pop 4 289 945 Handset 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited Result LG G5 29597 Apple iPhone SE 29276 Samsung Galaxy S7 28903 Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 28402 Apple iPhone 6s 28171 HTC 10 27392 Sony Xperia X Performance 26125 Google Nexus 6P 24703 Sony Xperia Z5 19197 Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus 17981 Huawei Mate 8 17947 HTC One X9 16877 Oppo R9 11053 Oppo R7s 8390 LG Stylus DAB+ 4321 Alcatel Pop 4 3863 Samsung Galaxy J2 3469 Ordinary camera: Again, you’re getting what you pay for, with relatively slow focus and mediocre colour representation. The Pop 4 is also somewhat unique in that while you can launch the camera from the lock screen, it’s the only phone we’ve ever hit that doesn’t include the camera app on the default launcher main page. It’s Android, so it’s not tough to add it, but that’s just plain weird. No colour choices: Alcatel produces the Pop 4 in a variety of eye catching colours, but you wouldn’t know that to look at Optus’ offering. If you get the Pop 4 through Optus, you can have it in grey, grey, or (you guessed it) grey. Locked to the Optus network: Not a surprising move, but if you buy the Pop 4 through Optus, it will be locked to its network, limiting your overall carrier choices until you get it unlocked. If you recharge the Pop 4 with $80 or more this is a free process; otherwise it will incur a $80 fee. Who is it best suited to? What are my other alternatives? Where can I get it?. Quick Verdict It’s a phone that you’d buy if you were cash-strapped. You can buy cheaper handsets than the Pop 4, but not many with this feature set.. Strengths It’s affordable Simple design Android 6.0 Marshmallow Good battery life. Could be better Slow processor means low performance Ordinary camera No colour choices Locked to the Optus network. Alcatel’s main forte is in affordable phones for the general audience, rather than show-stopping premium handsets that wow with features but take your breath away with high price points. The Pop 4, an exclusive to Optus in Australia, exemplifies this thinking, with a price of only $119.. Buy the Alcatel Pop 4 from Amazon AU. Enjoy a sharp display for all your needs, everywhere you go. Watch a movie, read an E-Book, or browse social media, all on a bright 5.5-inch HD (720P) display. That's a very respectable battery duration, although it is somewhat clarified by the Geekbench battery score, which measures performance while testing the battery. In order to reach that battery life duration, the Pop 4 isn't actually working all that hard, but that could be fine for those who only use their phones lightly during the day anyway.. Benchmarks aren’t the be-all and end-all of smartphone performance, but unfortunately for the Pop 4 they are broadly indicative. For single tasks it’s an adequate performer, but as soon as you load up anything even passably intense, you’ll experience delays and shuddering performance.. The same story plays out in game terms, with the Pop 4 only just not being the worst for 3D performance in 3DMark’s Ice Storm Unlimited test. While we wouldn’t expect it compare with phones costing eight or more times its asking price, if you were thinking of buying a Pop 4 for your games-obsessed kids, be aware that it won’t offer them all that much high-powered fun.. The Pop 4’s market is quite clear. It’s a phone that you’d buy if you were cash-strapped, or if you wanted a handset for those with minimal phone needs, or those who were likely to lose or break a phone. At $119 it was never going to be a world beater, and it isn’t, but it’s equally perfectly suitable value for that price. You could consider phones like Samsung’s Galaxy J2 in the same kind of price positioning if you want to explore other budget alternatives.

Hay 25 opiniones del Alcatel Pop 4+ .. yo siento que el celular tarda demasiado en cargar x lo demas todo bien. He comprado ayer el equipo en claro llegué a mi casa y lo cargué 6 horas como me dijeron recién hoy lo prendo y entre Descargar Whatsapp y Facebook las dos únicas aplicaciones la batería se ha ido en un 30% veo comentarios de personas que dicen que la batería es buena no entiendo.. Apenas compré este teléfono claro se que es un móvil un poco barato pero no me gustó que la salida del audio tanto en auxiliar como normal es muy pero muy bajo a diferencia del alactel one touch pop c9 que también es un poco más barato todavía que el pop 4 plus. ¿alguna sugerencia para ello? Se puede configurar o ya es de fabrica.. porque si en las especificaciones y en la caja dice que es de TRECE Y OCHO MEGApixeles y kuando entro en modo ingeniero dice ser de 8 y 5?. cuanto cuesta este celular en pesos colombianos. He visto varios reportajes sobre este modelo y videos en youtube. Me gusta y estoy por comprarlo. Solo preguntar si los contactos se pueden usar desde la sim o forzoso usarlos desde memoria movil?. Muy bueno el celular pero necesito saber cómo puedo hacer que suene en la radio porque le conecto el cable auxiliar y no me funciona no agarra y tampoco me deja con el cable USB como puedo hacerlo. Lo que no me gustó fue su cámara principal, porque a pesar de estar configurada en 13 mp su resolución final es con calidad de 5 mp o menos. Hola en todas las paginas se estan equivocando el telefono cuenta con camara principal de 13 megapíxeles y frontal de 8 investigen bien antes de publicar un telefono y ami me aaa encantado es un telefono que tiene todo lo que me gusta tener la bocina es vdd que no es tan buena pero la aplicación amplificador de volumen Good es muy buena usala en el 30 porque mas distorsiona y puedes acabar con tus bocinas suerte !!!!.
