State-of-the-art craftsmanship, powerful specifications and an attractive price. The Meizu MX5 is an eye-catcher without any doubt. It might be easy to create a phone, but creating one that is innovative can only be achieved by years of experience.. We have been using metal since our very first MP3 player. After two years of technical research and development, we have finally created an all-metal body for the MX5. We have also developed a state of the art coloring and injection molding process, which frees the metal back from unattractive antenna lines. Exquisite 12-gun 3D sand blasting, a 5 step anodizing process and superb fine polishing, make the MX5 amazing.. The Mediatek Helio X10 is a 64-bit octa-core CPU manufactured using the 28nm HPM process. It operates in a stable frequency and minimizes electrical leakage efficiently. The PowerVR G6200 certainly has outstanding performance. But even more importantly, the Helio X10 has a finely balanced power consumption, which makes the MX5 run smoothly and save power at the same time. The PowerVR G6200 doesn't easily reduce its operating frequency and helps to maintain stable framerates even after playing games for a prolonged period. Combined with the advanced 64-bit Flyme OS 4.5, the MX5 is the smoothest smartphone ever made by Meizu.. AMOLED display, for the better and for future. We were not completely satisfied with the highly praised LCD screen of the MX4. Thus, we took the initiative to increase costs and adopted future ready OLED technology. This high-end AMOLED display from Samsung comes with amazing specifications: 100% NTSC color gamut, 350 cd/mÂ² maximum brightness and an infinite contrast range. Together with MiraVision technology, it produces more vivid pictures and text is displayed crystal clear.. Dual-SIM with dual-standby and dual 4G. The MX5 supports dual-SIM with dual-standby. The primary 4G SIM-card provides you with high speed internet, while the second SIM-card provides you with 2G voice calls. There's no need to bring two phones with you: one MX5 is all you need. The dual Nano-SIM card design makes it easy and fast to switch between them.. A much better 20.7 megapixel camera. At the first glance, the MX5 still uses the MX4 camera configuration. However, take a look inside and you will find it is significantly different. Despite the thinner body of the MX5, we still equipped the camera with a 6P lens, which significantly increases its peripheral resolution. Laser-aided focusing technology helps you to make even more outstanding photos. Pictures taken in low light and in motion have significantly improved as well. Also, the heavily optimized white balance and sharpening algorithm make the pictures appear more natural and soft. It is not easy to create a camera trusted and loved by users, but we firmly believe that the MX5 has one that will win the hearts of many.Â. You no longer need to admire a MX4 Pro user, as the MX5 is equipped with a brand-new fingerprint identification system: mTouch 2.0. The new fingerprint sensor makes identification faster and the appearance smoother and elegant. There's even a colored PVD on the 0.45 mm metal ring, blending the comfortable bevel into the color of the entire body. The MX5 makes your life more secure and more convenient.Â. Advanced 64-bit Flyme OS 4.5 Loved by users. Flyme OS 4 was updated to the 64-bit Flyme OS 4.5 based on Android, with more than 100 functional updates. We were not satisfied with the already existing speed and efficiency in Flyme OS 4. That is why we have optimized over 2,000 items to achieve an increased smoothness of 20%, combining it seamlessly with the balanced and power-saving 64-bit Helio X10 processor.. 9 am - 9 pm GTM+8.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Ray S.. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 2 Interface, Performance and Connectivity. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction Chinese smartphone manufacturer Meizu came up with an unusually strong proposition last year, when it launched the MX4. A well-rounded phone that managed to find a rather good balance between features and affordability, the Meizu MX4's main asset was the combination of a stupendously large, 5.4" display, and a relatively compact body that almost didn't feel too big. After the strong flagship that the MX4 was, Meizu is now ready to follow up with its successor – the MX5. The company has shaked things up considerably, but the overall formula has remained unchanged: the same design language, the same software, but accompanied by an even larger screen , and a continued emphasis on what is once again a class-leading screen-to-body ratio. Let's dive deeper and explore the essence of this promising new star from the East! Design The MX5 takes the evolutionary path, fusing its tried and true body shape with metal. The overall appearance of Meizu phones has always gravitated around a single design concept: one that's very iPhone 3GS-like. That's not a bad thing, as while Apple and most other manufacturers have moved on in different directions, Meizu has decided to stay and evolve this type of exterior, coming up with some very interesting results along the way. Slimming bezels all around, the company reached an impressive 75% screen-to-body ratio with the MX4, producing a phone that felt manageble, all the while being equipped with a larger than average 5.4" IPS LCD screen. With the Meizu MX5, the screen-to-body figure has slightly dropped to 74%, but the phone feels even easier to handle than its predecessor, party thanks to it being significantly thinner: down to 0.30 inches (7.6mm) from 0.35 inches (8.9mm). Thankfully, while the display diagonal has grown even further to 5.5", the phone has actually become just a tad narrower: 2.94" (74.7mm) vs 2.96" (75.2mm). That's possible, because Meizu has transitioned from the wider 3:5 display aspect ratio of the MX4, to the more standard (and narrower) 9:16 one. Overall, we're pleased with the in-hand feel of the Meizu MX5. The phone even manages to feel lighter than its predecessor, all the while actually being heavier with .07 oz (2 grams). Due to being thinner and less top-heavy in comparison with the MX4, the Meizu MX5 is a lovely device to handle and use. The metal back plate also adds to the premium look and feel of the handset , as do the shiny, chamfered edges surrounding the front. Sadly, the MX5 continues to be heavily "inspired" by the iPhone's design, which is now most evident by the arrangement of the bottom side, where the microphone, charging port, screws and speakers look in an almost identical way to those of the iPhone 6 (or 5c). Meizu needs to realize that such blatant copying of design elements doesn't speak well of the company's overall efforts, so if it wants to be taken more seriously, it should instead focus on nurturing originality within its design team. Button execution, on the other hand, is something one can hardly copy, so it's interesting to see how Meizu has managed. We're mostly pleased with how the buttons react; the volume rocker and power/lock key (which is now conveniently situated on the right hand side) have a terrific response that makes you want to press them again and again. Sadly, the same thing cannot be said about the Home button, which now also incorporates a fingerprint scanner of the touch type. The problem is that it seems to have too much of a 'click', and it's also a bit on the wobbly side. As a result, it makes a defined and audible sound upon being pressed, but it has so much presence that it comes off as cheap, rather than satisfying. Still, we'd take this button over a shallow one that lacks movement. Display Meizu goes AMOLED; the results aren't pretty. If there's one thing that we like about the Meizu MX5's display, it has to be its size! At 5.5 inches, it's a screen we'd wholeheartedly enjoy, considering the reasonable footprint of the phone. Due to a combination of its impressive 74% screen-to-body ratio and thoughtfully rounded back plate, the MX5 allows us to work with a giant screen at little cost in the way of comfort. Resolution-wise, we're grateful to Meizu for being level-headed and sticking with 1080x1920 pixels, delivering the outstanding 401 ppi density. What we're not so grateful for is its decision to switch to an AMOLED screen, which has compromised some crucial aspects, such as color balance and brightness output. Last year, the Meizu MX4's IPS LCD panel had problems of its own, most notably a low gamma of 2.0 (somewhat washed-out looks) and a white point of about 7750 kelvins, making for a rather cold tone. Unfortunately, things haven’t really improved this year, as other problems have arisen in the place of the solved ones. While the gamma has been fixed, now sitting at 2.28, maximum brightness has suffered greatly, as it now peaks at the very modest 335 nits. In comparison, the Meizu MX4 reached 535 nits. At least the MX5’s 1-nit minimum brightness is ideal. Making matters worse, however, is the inaccurate color balance, which throws way too much green in there, taking the life out of whatever comes on screen. The oversaturated colors help negate that to an extent, but the effect is similar to trying to balance out a salty dish with sugar. Meizu has clearly used an outdated piece of AMOLED tech, which is truly an absurd thing to do these days. Anyway, it’s not so bad if you aren’t too picky, or if you don’t necessarily want to see colors in their natural state… Either way, this display is so 2013. Sorry for being the bearer of bad news, but the troubles with Meizu’s latest display don’t end here. This particular issue was actually present in the MX4 as well, so it looks like Meizu has been busy with something else during the last twelve months. Anyway, the automatic brightness control is definitely not up to snuff in the MX5. It cannot keep brightness at an optimal level as you are going through environments of various lightning level. Most of the time, it defaults to a brighter display state than needed, so if you are not OK with that, you’ll have to constantly adjust it manually. Meanwhile, if you enter a completely dark room, the display will not go all the way down; instead, it’ll continue to needlessly shine stronger than it needs to, requiring you to once again go manual. We guess this is mostly a software issue, so here’s to hoping that some day, an update will arrive that’s going to fix the MX5’s auto brightness problem.

The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. posted on 15 Sep 2015, 05:12. I don't know why phoneArena writers are giving harsh reviews. Just wait for the iPhone 6s review. (Posts: 2180; Member since: 06 Aug 2014). posted on 15 Sep 2015, 05:16. I hope not, new iPhones don't deserve more than 8, recently PA got very reasonable, but we all know how Apple magic works here :d. (Posts: 6; Member since: 14 Sep 2015). posted on 15 Sep 2015, 05:20. And because of "3D Touch" and (finally) 2gbs of ram it will get good grades I'm sure. Even though I agree with you, 5.8 for this device (considering review from other sites) does not seem fair. (Posts: 1728; Member since: 30 Jul 2013). posted on 15 Sep 2015, 05:52. You are from the future and you have had an iphone 6S in your hands for days so you can say it deserves 8 and nothing more? For the 55.000.000th time. SPECS MEAN NOT AS MUCH for iOS as much as they do for android. 1-2gb of RAM is more than enough for any 1080p iOS device. 8mp iphone 6 had one of the top 3 camera for a whole year. With its 1gb ram it worked smoothly and you could open as much apps as you liked. Seriously stop with the trolling and try to elaborate otherwise you sound like an old bitter man who hates seeing kids playing sports and enjoying life.. posted on 15 Sep 2015, 06:03. in response to #12 Hide. Yes specs do not matter but in Apple's case, I beg to differ. I really wish they could do more than just giving like 2-3 features in their products every year when some may or might have had them for a long time now.. (Posts: 2180; Member since: 06 Aug 2014). posted on 15 Sep 2015, 06:06. in response to #12 Hide. You know I thought the same thing after I posted my comment :d. For now 6S seems just like 6 would do in 2015 and IMO every iPhone after 4S deserves 8, no more, no less. I can't agree about camera, it was inferior at launch to such phones like 930, S5, Note 4 and G3. I hope though, this time it will be again on top. 2GB on iPad Air 2 does great job and 1GB was the only grip I had with iPhone's performance. You could open as many apps as you liked but only 3 tabs in Safari :D. And why only 8? Apple is deliberately holding back features that other phones have just because and offer it for incredibly high prices.. (Posts: 1236; Member since: 26 Sep 2012). posted on 15 Sep 2015, 05:24. The MX5's display is so 2013?. Well I have got a Note 3 from 2013 and if that is what you call so 2013...then that's pretty damn good even by today's standards. Appreciate Meizu for what it is...a really good device for the sweet sweet price!.

If you want to step back and look at device reviews from various companies, that is absolutely nothing new. And it's spread out throughout the year, in no way being concentrated around the time of iPhone releases. I don't know why people automatically think that it's impossible for phones to genuinely be bad/average and any score that is lower must mean that Apple or Samsung is somehow involved. For what reason would they even care? The two of them outsell every other manufacturer on the entire planet by HUGE margins, do you really think they're concerned about some proportionally tiny company that is in no way a threat?. Just because a device looks great on paper, doesn't mean it'll be great will in person. Although I do think something was up with that One Plus 2 review... But I suspect they got a bad review unit like Michael Fisher from PocketNow did. That being said, everyone is human that reviews these devices and everybody has their own subjective metrics. The only way to give a supposedly objective review would be to list or compare the specs of a phone and leave it at that. Once you interject opinion you open yourself up to whatever that person's personal ideals of greatness may be. Non bias is only possible to a point..

AcBugatti Veyron, on paper; should thrash any car around the track. And yet, a McLaren p1, LaFerrari, Porsche 918, Lamborghini Aventador SV, or Pagani Huayra will absolutely monster it around a circuit. Specs only tell a portion of the story..

I don't have to have driven them to know how to read and use logical inference. There aren't many places the Veyron has set an official lap time, the only one really being the Top Gear test track. It is slower than both the LaFerrari (granted, not driven by the stig) and the Pagani Huayra. Considering the 918 and P1 are around the same ability as a LaFerrari and the Lamborghini Aventador Super Veloce was only a few seconds off the time of the 918 at the Nurburgring it isn't a stretch to assume the Veyron a slower than all five. Granted, that does partially depend on what track you're talking about. In theory, a track like the one in Abu Dhabi or the Nurburgring should favor the Veyron because of their long straights... Vmax isn't really a useful metric for understanding track performance, and there have been a slew of advancements made in the decade since the Veyron came out. And its a heavy a** car..

Other phones - Hybrid AF Pure Image 2.0+ OIS+ 2 eyes activated, find as many cons as possible, give a low rating (unless the phone has less cons they'll have no choice but to give a high rating). I do like if PA becomes harsh and honest in their reviews, but I hate when they blindly give so much credit to Apple products. I'm glad I unsubscribed their Youtube channel and stopped watching their videos for a long time. One conclusion I found is, PA hates Chinese manufacturers and biased to Apple products. Sorry, I'm just being harsh and honest here, just like you guys.. (Posts: 372; Member since: 03 May 2014). posted on 15 Sep 2015, 08:22. If you hate something you just can rate it highly. I can guarantee they will rate Iphone 6s 9-9.5/10. Best camera in the world , even a 3000$ DSLR can't match it. 4K video recording is just out of this world. Battery is small but can easily run 2-3 days. Can stop a 50 calibre bullet .. posted on 15 Sep 2015, 08:44. Yeah, they totally never give Chinese manufacturers good reviews -_-. http://www.phonearena.com/revi ews/BLU-Vivo-Air-Review_id3924 (BLU phones are all rebranded Chinese products). All those "terribly" scored Chinese phones with 8's and 9's smh. Although I do think they had a defective unit for the 1 + 2 review, because that one doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Granted, I don't think that it deserves to get a 9 either because they objectively omitted a lot of features that current flagship phones have, let alone their bragging that it's a supposed 2016 flagship killer. Which is literally the first thing you see when you pull up their website for the 1 + 2. Did it ever occur to you that iPhones are simply good phones?.

Are they REALLY worth getting lower than 6? Are they really shoddy and not capable? Or are you just all phone snobs waiting to hand out your 9.5s on Samsung/Apple/Sony ??. posted on 15 Sep 2015, 06:23. Phone snobs, it's best not to think of them are real reviews.. posted on 15 Sep 2015, 07:38. The Alcatel One Touch idol 3 and ASUS Zenfone 2 both scored well over an 8, and they are definitely budget Phones from non mainstream manufacturers. As did the BLU Vivo Air. LG got pretty high scores with the g3 and g4. HTC did well with the m8. If I remember correctly, Huawei and Motorola scored in the high 8's as well.... Just because a product sounds amazing on paper doesn't mean that's the way it turns out to be in real life. A lot of these phones that are cheap have that price tag because they come from companies more interested in simply copying what everyone else is doing then actually taking their time and polishing a product, slapping parts into a phone and calling it a day. I'm not necessarily saying that's what happened here. But I do know that a hell of a lot of manufacturers that sound like they make amazing phones have decidedly average or sub par results in person. And even if we're going to use price as a metric, the new moto G and X from what I understand are both really good Phones. To a lesser extent, so are the Idol 3 and Zenfone 2. Price may not really give you leeway anymore. That's the result of the downward pricing pressure on Android. Price isn't really a safe haven anymore.. (Posts: 279; Member since: 15 Jan 2015). posted on 15 Sep 2015, 07:56. I dunno man, when a phone can score 1-10, this means 5.5 is the average, are they really REALLY saying that this phone is only a smidge above 'middle of the road'? Is it REALLY only a tiny bit better than "Meh"?. Although never having used THIS particular phone, I have used previous Meizu and I am very sure they would never do 'average' as a flagship device. Maybe I'm cynical, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm not. But it seems a lot of other PA commenters are also noticing the recent trend of unnecessarily bashing what's not considered cream of the crop. Still, that's why God invented more than 1 review site, right? ;). posted on 15 Sep 2015, 08:17. in response to #29 Hide. But that's just it, the thing about reviews is they are by definition subjective to that person's opinions. So you, or me, or whomever may have a particular opinion of a device... And someone who reviews phones for a living may disagree wholeheartedly. Especially since they often have access to multiple devices to compare it to. At the end of the day, even when these articles aren't direct comparisons that is the only way to really gauge how good a product is. I kind of wonder to what extent price plays into this? Like I said the BLU Vivo air, ASUS zenfone 2 and Alcatel One Touch idol 3 are all budget devices that scored well this year. You also have a handful of devices that have gotten between a 4 and a 6 this year. You also have you have the Moto G and Moto X Style/Play reviews around the corner. But if you just take a few seconds and peruse through their review history, they give low and high scores throughout the entire year. You could of course be right, I am in no way trying to discount your theory. Bias exists, be it intentional or subconscious... But I don't think you are right on this. At least not when I step back and look at things in context. But I do think that they got a bad review unit for the 1 + 2 like Michael Fisher did..

CNET también está disponible en español.. The Meizu MX5 unabashedly clones the iPhone. Chinese smartphone maker Meizu is known for its liberal usage of Apple designs, and its latest phone is no different, though with some added features.. by July 9, 2015 7:46 AM PDT. The Meizu MX5 looks remarkably similar to another phone you might know. Design and build 5.9 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches (140 by 75 by 7.6mm) 5.3 ounces (149 grams) 20.7-megapixel rear camera, 5-megapixel front The 20.7-megapixel rear camera comes with laser-assist focus and dual-tone flash. OS and hardware 5.5-inch, 1,920x1,080-pixel IPS display (401ppi) Android 5.0, Flyme 4.5 interface MediaTek Helio X10 64-bit octa-core 2.2GHz processor 3GB RAM, 16GB/32GB/64GB onboard storage. Pricing and availability Unlike the iPhone, Meizu's MX5 comes with dual-SIM 4G LTE support. Chinese smartphone maker Meizu's latest effort may seem rather familiar. The company, while not as well known outside of China as Xiaomi , is known for its liberal borrowing of design cues from Apple, and its latest phone the MX5 is no different.. Looking very much like the iPhone 6, the MX5 is clad in aluminum and weighs in at 149 grams (5.3 ounces) -- not too heavy. The phone comes in four colors: gray, gold, silver and black-silver. Given that it very much resembles the iPhone, you'll note that the MX5 shares the same curved corners (though it lacks the curved glass). It has similar beveled edges to the iPad Air.. Located at the rear is a 20.7-megapixel shooter, but it's right smack in the center near the top. It features an f2.2 aperture, a six-element lens and dual-tone flash. Meizu has also added laser-assisted focusing, similar to the one found on the LG G4. The front camera isn't too shabby either, as it packs a 5-megapixel sensor with an f2.0 aperture.. If you need more clues that Meizu is aping Apple, the phone has a home button that's also a fingerprint sensor, called the mTouch 2.0. If not for it being slightly oval in shape, this would likely put it in pure copycat territory. As it is, the MX5 is close enough you probably need a second glance to know it's not from Apple.. The MX5 is powered by MediaTek's Helio X10 turbo processor, which is a full 64-bit octa-core 2.2GHz processor, and it has a generous 3GB of RAM. While it lacks a microSD slot, it comes in either 16GB, 32GB or 64GB capacities.. The phone also sports a 5.5-inch full-HD AMOLED display, and Meizu claims a high 10,000:1 contrast ratio. It has a feature similar to Xiaomi's Sunlight Display, which amps up the contrast on dark areas of the screen for better viewing in an bright outdoor environment. The phone also ditches the clunky 5:3 display ratio of the previous MX4 , which didn't work well with apps.. Other specs include an embedded 3,150mAh battery and support for dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Glonass GPS. The phone also has dual SIM-card slots, both of which support 4G LTE.. As for software, it runs Android 5.0, but with Meizu's Flyme 4.5 UI on top. The Flyme skin has a flat design, though if you're getting one from China, Google services are likely to be missing. The UI looks good, though my last experience with it on the MX4 wasn't great due to all the bugs I encountered. Perhaps the MX5 will offer a much better experience.. The 16GB version of Meizu's MX5 will retail for 1,799 yuan in China, which converts roughly to $290, £190 and AU$390. The 64GB version will be a little more expensive at 2,399 yuan -- that's $385, £250 or AU$515 -- which isn't too bad, as you're getting four times the storage for less than $100 more. But if you're thinking of getting one, the bad news is there's no word on an official release in either the US, UK or Australia. If you're in China, you should be able to get one now, but otherwise it will likely be on Meizu's online store soon.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Meizu MX5 is coming with a full metal jacket this time in line with the times of premium handsets made of premium materials, and feature an upgraded processor, compared to the MX4 Pro, namely the Helio X10 Turbo chipset with eight Cortex-A53 cores at 2.2 GHz, and a PowerVR G6200 graphics processor. It is coupled with 3 GB of RAM, and the phone comes in 16, 32, or 64 GB of storage variants.

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance..

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Smartphone launches these days seem not limited to a mere introduction of the product by the company but an exhibition of how large its fan base is. Lately, we have seen Xiaomi, Asus, and now Meizu announcing their new devices at events in India which also had their community in attendance. While there is nothing really wrong with this, but the definition of what constitutes a product launch seems to have gotten blurred.. Chinese handset brand Meizu entered India back in May with the Meizu m1 note smartphone, priced at Rs. The company soon expanded its portfolio with the Meizu m2 note , which was priced even lower than its predecessor. After two launches in the affordable segment, the company has now unveiled the flagship Meizu MX5 , which it claims can compete against high-end flagships such as the Samsung Galaxy S6 ( Review | Pictures ) and iPhone 6 ( Review | Pictures ).. The Meizu MX5 has been launched in India with a price tag of Rs. 19,999 and offers a set of innards that looks impressive. The MX5 packs a fingerprint scanner, full-HD display, and an all metal body that will keep feature-obsessed consumers happy. We spent some time with the new Meizu MX5 at the launch event and here are our first impressions.. Few years back, an all metal body on a smartphone meant that it belonged to the premium segment. Handset makers have lately realised that budget and mid-range segment smartphones don't necessarily need to be associated with shoddy build quality, forcing the even likes of Samsung - which has long been associated with plastic phones - to up its game with metal design in the budget Galaxy A series.. The MX5 looks good, especially from the rear. The smartphone however feels like it could easily slip out of our hand due to the metal finish, something we have repeatedly said about other metal handsets such as HTC One M8 ( Review | Pictures ). At 149 grams, the handset seemed light and especially when compared with the OnePlus One (162 grams), a competing smartphone in the same price range.. The MX5 smartphone features a physical home button on the front panel just below the 5.5-inch screen. The physical home button on the MX5 to some extent looked like the one seen on Samsung phones.. One of the highlights of the MX5 is its fingerprint scanner feature. Meizu at its India launch event claimed that the mTouch fingerprint sensor on the MX5 can make identification faster and will be "smooth and elegant" in use. In our limited time spent with the device, we found that the fingerprint scanner functionality worked well. We tried using the fingerprint scanner feature for screen unlocks and it recognised our fingerprint without taking much time. The company touts that the fingerprint scanner functionality could be used to encrypt apps and documents; though due to time constraints we couldn't test this feature. The home button placement on the MX5 is apt for users with small hands and actually helps in one-handed operation.. The power button and volume rocker are placed on the right panel, and in our limited time with the MX5, the tactile feedback of both was good and responsive. The Micro-USB port is on the bottom panel accompanied by speaker grille, whereas the 3.5mm audio jack is on top.. The 5.5-inch Super AMOLED full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) display offers a pixel density of 401ppi. The smartphone also features Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. The full-HD display looks bright and colour reproduction was satisfactory. The viewing angles on the MX5 were also good; though visibility under direct artificial lights was below par. This might mean that the outdoor visibility under natural light can be a problem for MX5 users, but we would wait until we spend more time with the device as part of our detailed review process.. Meizu has heavily skinned its MX5 with Flyme 4.5 UI based on Android 5.0 Lollipop. There is no onscreen home or back buttons on the MX5 as the physical button doubles up as a home button as well as back button - you press as normal to go to the home screen, and you swipe on the button to go back, which takes some time to get used to. The phone ships with 5 default home screen panes; though users can add more if needed. The handset we used had the panes named as A, B, C, and D alongside the home screen. We tried to find an option to change it but couldn't find it.. Like some other Chinese handsets, the MX5's Flyme OS also ditches app drawer and packs all the apps on the home screen. The OS offers users a lot of customisation options as users can opt to see Flyme-styled icons or can choose normal ones. Meizu has preloaded the MX5 with a number of apps including Instagram, Snapdeal, Facebook, and Gaana, among others. The handset also comes preloaded with some games such as Shadow Gun and Asphalt 8. After spending some time with MX5, we can say that users will take some time to get use to the OS on the handset.. During the time we spent getting acquainted with the Meizu MX5, we found that the smartphone was responsive to the touch inputs and was quick during multitasking. Under the hood, new MX5 smartphone packs MediaTek's 64-bit Helio X10 octa-core processor (Cortex-A53) clocked at 2.2GHz coupled with 3GB of RAM and PowerVR G6200 GPU. We will reserve our verdict on MX5 smartphone's performance until we get a chance to put it through the paces for our detailed review.. The company will be launching its MX5 in three storage variants - 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB. The smartphone ships with dual SIM support and both the SIMs support 4G network. Apart from 4G, the handset also supports 3G, EDGE/ GPRS, Wi-Fi, GPS/ A-GPS, Bluetooth, and Micro-USB connectivity options.. The Meizu MX5 sports a 20.7-megapixel rear camera with Sony IMX220 Exmor RS BSI sensor, laser autofocus and dual tone LED flash. There is a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture also on board. In our limited camera testing, we found the images clicked by MX5 in normal light conditions (artificial) to be crisp.. Even the low-light performance of the camera was impressive with good amount of details. The rear camera can also record videos at 4K resolution. The front camera performance in low light was average. But once again, wait for our detailed review when we will really get a chance to test the camera under varied conditions.. At a price of Rs. 19,999, the Meizu MX5 goes head-on with the OnePlus One ( Review | Pictures ), which is currently retailing at Rs. One of the biggest qualms with the MX5 is its limited storage as it doesn't support microSD cards.. The company at the event stressed that it is working to improve the after sales service of its handsets in India. Li Nan, Vice President - Marketing, Meizu Technology, at the event confirmed that the company will be unveiling 40 customer service centres across 20 Indian cities as well and will offer a doorstep service facility as well..

Meizu MX5 review Meizuâs latest is a fairly solid performer, though far from revolutionary. by Krystal Lora July 30, 2015. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. -very decent camera with lots of features. While not without issues, the Meizu MX5 is still a solid performer overall with its fingerprint scanner being one of its biggest standout features.. Display 5.5 inch AMOLED Full HD (1080x1920) Density: 401ppi. Processor Octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 8 x 2.2GHz. Software Android 5.0.1 Lollipop Flyme OS 4.5. Camera 20.7 MP rear camera with dual LED flash. Dimensions 149.9 x 74.7 x 7.6 mm. A big focus by smartphone manufacturers this year has been on offering consumers quality devices that donât break the bank, and weâve seen some fantastic new additions to this segment from the like of Asus , Alcatel OneTouch , and a slew of Chinese OEMs. The fact that high-end doesnât necessarily have to mean expensive was really brought into the spotlight just this week however, with the ZTE Axon Phone , OnePlus 2. and the new Motorola flagships, the Moto X Style and Moto X Play , bursting on to the scene. Joining this intensely competitive arena now is Meizu, with their latest flagship offering. Does this device manage to stand out in this ever-growing and impressive crowd? We find that out, and more, in this in-depth Meizu MX5 review!. The Meizu MX5 retains a lot of the design language of its predecessor, and as such, also continues to feature a very familiar look with an inspiration that is obvious. Unlike previous iterations of this flagship line though, Meizu has gone from using a metal frame and plastic backing to a full metal unibody design that curves around the sides to meet the large display up front, allowing for the premium feel that is expected from a current generation flagship.. One easily noticeable difference in the design between generations is the presence of a physical home button up front, with an integrated fingerprint scanner, in the case of the Meizu MX5, replacing the capacitive home button found with its predecessor, which also doubled as a notification light. With this feature not available anymore, a notification LED is now included, found in its more traditional location above the display. The home button can feel a little cheap at times, which isnât great, given all the different ways this button is used – as a home button, as a back button, and as a fingerprint scanner.. Taking a look around the device, on the right side is the power button below the volume rocker, placed to be within easy reach, and the dual SIM card slot can be found on the opposite side. The buttons may not be of the highest quality, but do offer a decent tactile feel and good responsiveness. The headphone jack is up top, and at the bottom is the microUSB port, flanked by a microphone and a single speaker unit.. While not the thinnest smartphone around, its 7.6 mm thickness makes it quite sleek, and its weight of 149 grams results in a device that feels substantial and comfortable in the hand. Despite its metal construction, the MX5 isnât particularly slippery and provides a secure grip, and the overall handling experience is far better than what you might get with other smartphones with a similar build.. The Meizu MX5 comes with a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with a 1080p resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 401 ppi, and the display is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 panel, to keep things scratch-free. Meizu decided to ditch the rather odd 16:10 aspect ratio seen with its previous devices for the more standard 16:9, which is a very welcome change.. While Quad HD is dominating the high-end Android smartphone scene, the 1080p display of the Meizu MX5 certainly more than gets the job done. The display is beautiful, with AMOLED technology bringing everything we love about it, including colors that pop and are nice and saturated, deep blacks, and high brightness. The color temperature does lean towards the warmer side of things though, resulting in a slightly pinkish hue on white backgrounds. It may not be the sharpest display around, but the difference is hardly noticeable, and the media-viewing and gaming experience is an absolute joy.. Under the hood, the Meizu MX5 packs an octa-core MediaTek MT6795 (Helio X10 Turbo) processor, clocked at 2.2 GHz, and backed by the PowerVR G6200 GPU and 3 GB of RAM.. MediaTek processors may not entirely match up with the Snapdragons of the world, but in the case of the Meizu MX5, there were rarely any problems with performance. Opening, closing, and switching between apps is a breeze, and the device flies through the various elements of the UI. The device also handles multi-tasking and gaming very well, which hasnât always been the case with Meizu devices and others that feature MediaTek processors. That said, a big contributing factor to this smooth performance is also the software optimization that Meizu has managed with the latest version of the FlyMe OS.. The phone is available in 16, 32, and 64 GB variants, but with the lack of expandable storage via microSD card, you will certainly be better off opting for the higher built-in storage options. The device also comes with a standard suite of connectivity options, along with 4G LTE support, but it is recommended to check for compatibility with your local network carrier first if you do decide to pick up this device.. As mentioned, the physical home button up front has different uses, with a press required for it to work as a home button, and a tap to make it function like a back button. Finally, the button also comes with an integrated fingerprint scanner, that is called M-Touch. The touch type implementation is certainly the one we prefer, and it works incredibly well on the MX5. It is really fast, making it very quick and easy to unlock the device and get into your homescreen. There have been no issues with the scanner failing to recognize the fingerprint, and it actually manages to feel faster than the implementations found with some of the other, more high-end, devices out there.. The single speaker at the bottom isnât the best sounding out there, but is far from the worst. The audio can sometimes sound a bit tinny, but overall, it allows for a decent audio experience, and can certainly get very loud. As is the case with any bottom-mounted speaker though, it is fairly easy to cover it up when holding the device in the landscape orientation, but the curve along that side does alleviate this issue to some extent, even if only a little bit.. On the battery front, the Meizu MX5 comes with a 3,150 mAh non-removable battery, that allows for some impressive battery life. Regardless of your usage, you can always manage up to 4.5 hours of screen-on time, and the battery should allow for a full day of use for most users. Something odd is the fact that the âPhone Idleâ mode seems to strain the battery a lot, which is very surprising. Since the battery life is still good, it isnât a big concern, but the battery life should get even better if and when this bug is fixed.. There are few different battery saving modes built-in as well, with the default Balance mode functioning very well for the most part. Graphic-intensive gaming may require a switch to Performance mode, but the default setting otherwise keeps everything running smoothly. There is of course, a power saving mode available that lets you get that little bit of extra juice out of the battery. If you do run out of battery life, the MX5 comes with fast charging capabilities, called M-Charge, that will allow you to charge the device to up to 60% in just 40 minutes.. The Meizu MX5 comes with a 20.7 MP rear camera, with an f/2.2 aperture, and found below the camera is a dual tone LED flash and a laser-guided autofocus. The camera app is very simple, clean, and easy to use, with quick access to a bunch of different modes, like a full manual mode, that gives you granular control over aspects like shutter speed, ISO, exposure, and focus. Other modes include panorama, and Light Field, that takes a lot of shots fast at different focus points, allowing you adjust the focus after the fact.. Shooting in Auto mode allows for some good looking pictures, and it is actually quite surprising how nice they can look, with saturated colors and good detail. Dynamic range is good, but it is up to you to cater the shot correctly, so even if Auto mode is supposed to automatically adjust to take the best picture, that isnât always the case.. Tapping on the viewfinder helps with the focus and the adjustment of light, but this can be very finicky. You have to make sure that you tap exactly on where you want the camera to focus, and adjust the light to that area. Being off by just a little bit can result in an image that is either too dark, or too bright, and it does require a few tries to get it just right, which can be frustrating. HDR helps in this regard, but does require a second or two to take the picture.. Overall though, when you do get it right, some great shots are possible. As expected, low light shots can be a little noisy and lacking in detail, but the images donât look too bad either.Â. Video recording is great on the MX5 too, recording at 30 fps, along with 4K recording available as well. Slow Motion video capture is also possible, at 100 fps, and even though that isnât as slow as some other flagship smartphones, the quality is certainly impressive.. The device also comes with a 5 MP front-facing camera, which allows for some decent self portraits. Pictures have a good amount of detail, but one thing you do have to watch out for is the fact that it tends to prioritize the primary subject, making anything that is even slightly in the background a little blurry. Taking advantage of the front-facing camera is Beauty mode, with settings that lets you change the size of your eyes, make your face a bit slimmer, and more. This mode may not be practical or useful for everyone, but can definitely be fun to play around with.. On the software side of things, the Meizu MX5 runs its own customized FlyMe OS 4.5, based on Android 5.0.1 Lollipop. Of course, youâll be hard pressed to find any stock Android and Material Design elements in this user interface, and overall, the software experience can take some getting used to.. For starters, there is no application drawer available, leaving users dependent on folders to stay organized and keep the homescreens from getting too cluttered. The Settings menu is very iOS-like in its implementation, which isnât necessarily a bad thing, but is of course, very different from what you may already be familiar with. Trying to get to the Settings app itself can be a pain, as there isnât a direct shortcut available in the Quick Settings menu in the notification dropdown, so you will have to make sure that the Settings icon is at placed at an easily accessible location on the homescreen.. The FlyMe OS may be one of the more simpler takes on Android, but it does pack some cool and useful features, like the ability to lock apps so that they require a pass code to get in to. As mentioned, the physical home button also doubles as a back button, but when it comes to opening the multi-tasking screen, it does get a little strange, since there is no dedicated Recent Apps key to be found. You will have to slowly swipe up from the bottom, to open what looks a lot like the iOS 6 used app dock. Previews of the apps isnât available, but you can close them with a simple swipe up.. One of the key aspects of a device like the Meizu MX5 is its affordable price point, with the device starting at $339 for the 16 GB iteration, and going up to $459 for the highest 64 GB storage option. Available colors for the Meizu MX5 include black, gold, and silver.. So there you have it for this closer look at the Meizu MX5! The device may have some cosmetic issues, like the somewhat cheap feeling home button, but it does what it is meant to do amazingly well.. The performance is smooth, the display is beautiful, the battery life is impressive, the camera is reliable, the fingerprint scanner is fantastic and the overall build quality is actually very nice, allowing for a great feel in the hand. In the end, the Meizu MX5 is definitely a worthy competitor in the affordable smartphone space, but it might be easy to miss in the crowd, especially with the latest flagship devices that have launched over the last few days..

Home > Topics > Smartphone > Android > Smartphone Reviews > Meizu MX5 Smartphone Review. Rating 1 to 10, top score 10. Thin display bezels, excellent display ratio Above average performance Simple and intuitive Flyme OS. Insufficient maximum display brightness Unbalanced color imaging Flyme OS details a bit unpolished. The exotic Meizu MX5 is a decent option for its price, should you be able to actually find it in the US.. Meizu’s MX5 separates itself from an upper mid-range smartphone market crowded with reasonably priced devices , with an exceptionally good ratio of display to product size. It comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD AMOLED screen that occupies 74.5 percent of the phone’s surface, offering an outstandingly elegant and ergonomic design that is easy to hold with one hand, despite the size.. The MX5 bears an uncanny resemblance to the iPhone , in both the body and software. The MX5 has a single physical key, with a built-in fingerprint reader, centrally located below the display. Meizu’s Flyme OS 4.5 is built off of Android 5 Lollipop, but the MX5 skin is very similar to iOS. The Meizu MX5 features an octa-core Mediatek Helio X10 chipset, 20.7-megapixel rear camera and a 3150 mAh battery, making it one of the most attractive a devices of the increasingly popular ‘Chinese wave’ of smartphones .. The Meizu MX5 looks an iPhone, but it’s all Android. The 7.6 mm (0.30 inches) thick metal unibody makes the MX5 equally elegant and comfortable. Not many MX5 competitors are able to combine a 5.5-inch screen that can be easily held with one hand, with a premium-class finish. The 5.5-inch screen is even more impressive when considering the 150 x 75 mm (5.90 x 2.94 inches) dimensions, meaning the display makes up 74.5 percent of the phone. The left and right bezels are exceptionally slim while there is just enough room above and under the display for the speaker, the selfie-camera, signal LED light and, the oval home key. The device weighs 149 grams (5.26 oz), which is also a rarity among 5.5-inch metal smartphones.. The bottom of the phone looks like the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s, but does not entirely lack originality: it comes with a secondary microphone (instead of an audio jack), a microUSB hub, and speaker perforations. The Meizu MX5’s audio slot is located on the upper side of the handset, while the power key and the volume rocker are on the right side. The left side includes two nanoSIM card slots, tucked away and accessible by pin key however, there is no microSD card slot, thus the memory of this handset cannot be expanded.. The rear side of the Meizu MX5 includes a 20.7-megapixel camera lens, which is impressive for a mid-range smartphone, and a LED flash under it. The only flaw of the MX5 design is the protruding rear-facing camera. The phone will not lie flat on its back and is more susceptible to scratches or stains of the camera lens. It is hard to blame Meizu for the aforementioned lack of originality in relation to Apple, as the success of the iPhone has bred many copycats.. The Meizu MX5 comes with a 5.5-inch (1080 x 1920) Full HD AMOLED display, with a Gorilla Glass 3 screen, resulting in a solid 401 pixel per inch density. The previous generation MX4 had a poor IPS display that had washed-out and cold colors. By introducing AMOLED to the MX5 the cold and pastel feel is no longer an issue. However this does not mean the images are perfect. AMOLED is famous for overly saturated colors, and these look very bright on the Meizu MX5. This is not a problem for many users, however, as some prefer such a screen on all smartphones. That being said, the MX5 still suffers from a slight color cast with a shift towards the greener part of the palette. No matter how bright and saturated the colors are, at the same time they are not “perfect” due to that unwanted green cast. Again, this will not be a major problem in practice for most people as the Meizu MX5 indeed offers very impressive image quality.. There are no issues when it comes to the contrast and a consistent image quality across the surface of the screen. This device measures up to high-end flagship models in these two criteria, as it offers excellent viewing angles, very dark black tones and solid visibility when directly exposed to sunlight. There is room for improvement when it comes to automatic display brightness, given the MX5 does not perform that well in dark rooms and tends to produce images that is too bright. Clearly, this is a software ‘issue’ that might be resolved with future OS upgrades. Contrast this with the fact that the MX5 also has an underwhelming maximum brightness, making it less than ideal in bright outdoor environments..

While we may be a bit late with this review it was certainly something we were looking forward to as Meizu devices usually tend to be nicer than expected. We were excited to see whether this would be the case yet again as the expectations for the Meizu MX5 were already quite high - shipping with a great display, blazing-fast hardware and a capable camera all that at a quite reasonable price point.. Instead of combining all the latest available tech, Meizu returned to its roots offering a balanced flagship with a reasonable price tag. The new MX5 is a thoughtful combination of premium design, capable internals and for the first time - an AMOLED screen.. Meizu smartphones are already easier to get outside of China and a quick search reveals Meizu listings on many popular online retailers. The 64GB models are still a rarity though, but we hope this will improve in time, too.. The only feature that will definitely be missed is the microSD card slot, which should have been an alternative of the second SIM. Then again Meizu isn't favorable towards expansion slots for quite some time.. The Meizu MX5 retail box awaits unpacking right after the break.. Camera, image quality, video recording and quality 9.

Hardware and design [ edit ]. The Meizu MX is a smartphone designed and produced by the Chinese manufacturer Meizu Technology , which runs on a modified Android operating system, dubbed as FlyMe OS. It is the company's second Android-based smartphone, after the Meizu M9. The MX is Meizu's first smartphone to be released outside mainland China , as its launch also happened in Hong Kong at the same time, on January 1, 2012. Since the development phase, Meizu announced that the MX would come in a dual-core and a quad-core model, the second being due to be released later than the first. This made Meizu the first company to announce a quad-core smartphone [3] and, later, the first to announce an Exynos 4 -based smartphone, [4] beating the Samsung Galaxy S III in marketing time (even though the latter went on sale first).. The MX was the first Meizu phone to achieve extensive coverage on tech blogs and websites outside China because of its features comparable to the flagship phones of major mobile phone manufacturers. Thanks to the good reception, rumors stated the MX could arrive on Western markets. 2.2 Hardware and design. The first rumors about a successor of the Meizu M9 leaked out in Q4 2010, even before M9's official launch itself, suggesting that a so-called M9II phone was in development, with a dual-core processor, 4-inch screen and 1 GB of RAM. [6] Initially, this phone was supposed to look almost identical the M9, [7] although with upgraded hardware, and some media thought it could have been a competitor in China to the iPhone 5, rumored to be in development, as happened with the Meizu M9. In mid-April 2011 Meizu officially confirmed [9] that the company was developing the phone, along with declaring that its name would be MX (M10, following the company's product name numeration). [10] In this period the MX was attributed a Retina -like display resolution (1280x854 or 1200x900 pixels), [6] which is not the one of the production models' display.. The device's final design [Note 1] , price and release date [Note 2]. were changed many times, as happened before with the M9 .. Pre-orders for the dual-core MX started on December 15, 2011 and granted a guarantee to receive the phone exactly on January 1, 2012, the day that official distribution started through the company's flagship stores (in China and Hong Kong). [17] On launch day many customers waited for their turn outside the stores, forming queues (not as long as the ones for the M9 though); some reports claim that Meizu wanted to avoid attracting big crowds (for a matter of public order), so the customers who pre-ordered the devices were invited to arrive at the store only after receiving a phone confirmation. Even so, people started arriving the night before January 1. Meizu assured that production and supplies would be able to meet customers' demand by 2012 Chinese New Year's Day (January 23), advising people to order the MX as soon as possible to receive it by that date. [17] Meanwhile, the quad-core version was rumored to be going on sale around mid-2012 [19] and on April 16, 2012 it was officially announced that it would start selling in June. Meizu, in partnership with PCCW Mobile , held a launch party in Hong Kong on June 25, 2012, formalizing the release date of the MX 4-core : June 30. [21] On that day many customers went to pick up their new phone at Meizu stores, resulting some cities running out of stock the same day. On July 14 a new, improved dual-core model was released, replacing the old model in Meizu's product lineup. nm SoC , a bigger capacity battery and an improved Wi-Fi module. The Meizu MX is available in two variants, differing primarily for the system on a chip they use: one model uses an Exynos 4 Dual 32. nm with a dual-core 1.4 GHz ARM Cortex-A9 CPU , an ARM Mali 400 quad-core GPU and 1 GB of RAM , while the other model, named MX 4-core, uses the Exynos 4 Quad 32. nm with a quad-core 1.4 CPU (the other characteristics being equal). Meizu declares that the Exynos 4 Quad used by the MX 4-core model has a CPU 60% faster and a GPU 50% faster, compared to the previous model, while at the same time consuming 20% less battery. [20] The dual-core model is equipped with a 16 GB flash memory for internal storage, while the quad-core model is available with either a 32 GB or a 64 GB memory. The current dual-core model was preceded by another one, currently discontinued, which used a battery 100 mAh less powerful than the one mounted on the quad-core model, had a display with lower contrast and a Wi-Fi module with poorer reception. The present dual-core model has been updated with the corresponding components from the 4-core variant. (See the Launch and sale section for further information). The Meizu MX has a plastic body with a Gorilla Glass display cover; it measures 121.3. It has a classic candybar shape , being rectangular with rounded corners, and presents only one central physical button at the front, like many modern touchscreen smartphones. The MX features also two situation aware capacitive keys (which are also haptic enabled ), a technology patented by Meizu; these soft keys have different functions based on the device's orientation and functions. The front of the phone, including the key and the metal border around it, is completely black, and so is the internal chassis , while the back cover is available in five different colors ( pure white , ivory white , misty pink , lilac purple and milky lime ). [25] These covers are made from double-layer plastics: the bottom one is colored and the top one is transparent, giving the back a glossy finish, similarly to other smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S III and the Huawei Honor.. The MX features a 4-inch diagonal, 960x640 pixel ( DVGA resolution) ASV multi-touch capacitive touchscreen display, with an aspect ratio of 3:2, supporting up to 16 million colors and with a pixel density of 288 ppi.. In addition to the touchscreen input and the front keys, the device has a volume/zoom control on the right side and the power/lock button on the top. The MX doesn't have a camera shutter key, but it is possible to capture a photo using the volume key or by swiping a finger on the proximity sensor (via a software update). The Meizu MX has a VGA front-facing camera and an 8.0 MP camera on the back. The main camera has a backside illuminated CMOS sensor with autofocus ; the optics have an aperture of f/2.2 and the macro focus is capable of clearly capturing objects as close as 5–10. The software settings includes support for geotagging , smile detection, panorama mode and wide dynamic range. The MX4 received generally positive reviews.. Engadget gave the MX a score of 74 out of 100 possible points and praised the sharp display, great audio quality and good build quality. ^ Initially, the MX design leaked from the Patent Office suggested a shape similar to that of the M9, but with a new back camera with and LED flash, a front camera and the SIM tray at the top. [11] Nearer to the final launch new photos unveiled a new, rounded home button and two touch buttons with LEDs that rotate according to the phone's orientation. ^ The first announced release date was a vague "September 2011", [13] then Meizu CEO delayed the date first to October 1( Chinese National Day ) [14] and later to December. [15] Most sources reported that both the dual-core and the quad-core models would be released at the same time, but the real announcement was referred only to the dual-core variant [16]. ^ "Meizu MX website". ^ a b Richard Lai (January 1, 2012).

Bước ra từ quốc gia phồn thịnh, nhà sản xuất Meizu tiếp tục khẳng định đẳng cấp từ lâu đã trở thành bản sắc của đất nước Vạn lý trường thành bằng “bom tấn” tầm trung Meizu MX5 – smartphone được kì vọng sẽ “làm nên chuyện” tại thị trường Châu Á nói riêng và thế giới nói chung.. Meizu MX5 được xem là "bom tấn" của phân khúc tầm trung. Trình làng với tư cách là quân át chủ bài của một thương hiệu lớn, Meizu MX5 ngay lập tức tỏa ra sức cuốn hút vô cùng mãnh liệt khiến làng công nghệ một phen xôn xao. Sở hữu vóc dáng đẳng cấp không thua kém gì siêu phẩm iPhone 6 , camera 20 MP tự động lấy nét bằng lazer, và cấu hình chip 8 nhân mạnh mẽ, Meizu MX5 rất có thể sẽ là vật cản rất lớn “ngáng đường” đến ngôi vô địch phân khúc tầm trung của các smartphone đến từ Samsung, HTC hay Sony.. Không hề thua kém các thương hiệu “đồng hương” như Xiaomi hay Huawei, Meizu MX5 được chăm chút rất nhiều ở tiểu mục thiết kế, hướng đến “khoảng trời” rộng lớn cạnh tranh trực tiếp với smartphone cao cấp đến từ Apple.. Sở hữu thiết kế kim loại nguyên khối sắc lạnh và sang trọng, các góc cạnh được bo tròn nhẹ nhàng và tinh tế, nút home bầu dục thon dài ấn tượng và mới lạ, màn hình có tiết diện rộng và độ phủ lớn, Meizu MX5 nổi bật hẳn lên khi đặt cùng các thiết bị tầm trung khác, nhìn sơ qua sẽ có cảm giác “na ná” iPhone 6, đẳng cấp và sắc xảo.. Meizu sở hữu thiết kế khá tinh tế, thanh lịch mỏng 7.6mm. Meizu MX5 chỉ mỏng 7.6 mm, trọng lượng 149g, yếu tố này giúp sản phẩm phù hợp với nhiều đối tượng khách hàng, dễ dàng bỏ túi khi sử dụng, tạo cảm giác dễ chịu khi cầm nắm. Hơn thế nữa, hai mặt trước sau được bao phủ bởi lớp kính cường lực Gorilla Glass 3 sang trọng, giúp Meizu MX5 trở nên bóng bẩy và cuốn hút hơn.. “Nối gót” các đồng đội đi trước là Meizu MX4 , Meixu MX4 Pro , điện thoại Meizu MX5 bứt ra khỏi ranh giới của một thiết bị tầm trung thông thường, hướng đến trải nghiệm tuyệt vời của người dùng, tạo sự tương tác tuyệt vời giữa người dùng và sản phẩm, chú trọng trang bị tiểu mục màn hình sắc nét, đẳng cấp.. Cụ thể, với màn hình 5.5 inch, công nghệ AMOLED hiện đại, độ phân giải 1080 x 1920 pixels, tích hợp cùng độ phủ màn hình rất lớn lên đến 74.5% và mật độ điểm ảnh 401 ppi, Meizu MX5 mang đến những góc cạnh tuyệt đẹp trong từng hình ảnh, biến những thời khắc thao tác lướt web, chơi game, xem video trở thành những khoảng thời gian tuyệt vời với cảm giác chân thực, hiển thị sắc nét, mịn màng, sáng rõ..

Với những thông số ấn tượng này, Meizu MX5 tự tin so găng cùng các đối thủ nặng kí trong cùng phân khúc, mang lại những góc hình ảnh có chiều sâu tốt, độ tương phản cao, giảm tối đa độ nhiễu, hướng đến sự hoàn thiện tuyệt vời.. Chỉ nằm trong phân khúc tầm trung, nhưng Meizu MX5 được trang bị tiểu mục camera vô cùng ấn tượng, nếu đặt lên bàn cân thì tương đương với các thiết bị cao cấp..

Với những thông số này, Meizu MX5 dễ dàng cho xuất xưởng những bức ảnh đẳng cấp, thời thượng và ấn tượng.. Bộ đôi camera của Meizu MX5 có thông số khá ấn tượng, sẵn sàng xuất xưởng những hình ảnh đẹp, góc cạnh. “Máy ảnh” trước cũng không hề bị Meizu MX5 “bỏ rơi”, trong giới hạn phân khúc tầm trung, camera trước 5MP, 1080p là yếu tố khá sáng giá, đáng được ghi nhận.. Được mệnh danh là “bom tấn tầm trung” hẳn nhiên nội lực của Meizu MX5 phải rất mạnh mẽ. Với bộ vi xử lí Helio X10 Turbo 8 nhân Cortex-A53 cho tốc độ xung nhịp 2.2 GHz, cùng con chip đồ hoạ PowerVR G620, tích hợp hoàn hảo với dung lượng RAM 3GB, bộ nhớ trong 32GB, cấu hình Meizu MX5 khá ấn tượng, đủ sức chinh chiến với các ứng dụng từ phổ thông đến đa nhiệm, hiệu năng đạt tốc độ cao, nhanh nhạy và ấn tượng.. Vận hành dưới môi trường hệ điều hành Android 5.0 Lollipop và giao diện tùy biến. Flyme 4.5 đặc trưng của nhà sản xuất Meizu, Meizu MX5 “đáng gờm” hơn rất nhiều, sẵn sàng nghênh chiến với mọi tựa game nặng nề, cồng kềnh, hoàn toàn xóa bỏ tình trạng giật, lag, không có độ trễ, không bị thoát khỏi ứng dụng khi đang chạy.. Meizu MX5 sở hữu cấu hình mạnh mẽ, thỏa sức vận hành các ứng dụng đa nhiệm nặng. Tính năng cảm biến vân tay cũng được kì vọng sẽ giúp Meizu MX 5 bứt phá mạnh mẽ hơn nữa trên con đường tranh đấu ngôi vô địch phân khúc tầm trung.. Thời lượng pin chính là “miếng đòn ” quan trọng của Meizu MX5 , với viên pin 3150 mAh tích hợp cùng công nghệ sạc nhanh mCharge, có thể nạp 25% năng lượng trong vòng 10 phút và 50% trong vòng 30 phút, Meizu MX5 không những bền bỉ khi hoạt động, mà còn lấy lại nguồn sức mạnh rất nhanh để tiếp tục hoạt động hiệu quả.. Với dung lượng pin này, Meizu MX5 có thể chạy tốt trong hơn một ngày dài làm việc tối đa hiệu suất, đồng thời đây cũng là một thông số khá hiếm hoi của dòng smartphone có màn hình 5.5inches, độ phân giải Full HD và chỉ mỏng 7,6mm.. mCharge giúp Meizu MX5 nổi bật và đẳng cấp hơn. Tiếp tục là một đại diện “đáng gờm” đến từ Trung Quốc, Meizu MX5 được đánh giá là smartphone tầm trung đáng mua nhất, đồng thời dự đoán sức càn quét thị trường của thiết bị này sẽ vô cùng lớn..

Author Bharadwaj Chandramouli Posted on August 11, 2015 August 26, 2015 Categories Android , Featured , Headlines , Meizu , Reviews. "Meizu MX5 Review" , 5 out of 5 based on 37 ratings.. A flagship is usually a company’s best product. It’s top-of-the-line, packed with a lot of new and innovative features, but is decidedly out of reach in terms of affordability. That was how things were until everything changed in the last year or so. Now we have flagship grade devices that are accessible, without many compromises that usually come with low price points. The Meizu MX5 is one of them. Announced a month back in China, the MX5 has all the features and aesthetics you’d look for in a flagship and is quite affordable, but should you buy it? The short answer is yes and the long answer for why, is called a review, read on.. Let’s talk about the brand first. Meizu is a well-known name in China. They’re not in the top 5 but are a substantial part of the crowded Chinese market. In the last two years, a lot of these Chinese manufacturers have expanded to India, with Meizu being one of the newest entrants. Why now? Well, India’s a natural choice, but it may also be because of a recent investment from Alibaba , triggering a new wave of change in company strategy. Meizu has been selling devices in India only for the past few months now, but our experience with the brand goes way back.. The first Meizu I tried was the MX2, which turned out to be surprisingly good. It was good looking and seemed to have the right priorities in design. The MX5 is three generations ahead and has become the first MX series device to sport a full metal body, so let’s start with design and ergonomics.. Read: A week with the beautiful Meizu MX5. The design of the MX5 closely follows the evolutionary path set by its predecessors. From a distance it looks like a combination of the Samsung Galaxy S6 and an iPhone 6 plus but up close, it’s pretty clear that the design is typically Meizu, except for the new home button that houses a newer fingerprint sensor, more on that later.. The glass on the front sits on a full metal frame with chamfered edges which are shiny enough to be visible on the front face of the phone. This full metal frame ends where the full metal body begins on the sides. The metal is curved from the sides to the back to fit your hands and has a smooth matte finish. This finish was highlighted by Meizu at their event for its meticulous 68-step 30-day process, which yields a 21g metal body. You can read more about the process here , but the point is, the effort that has gone into making the metal body shows.. The finish is beautiful and screams high quality, deserving of its flagship title. However, metal bodies interfere with signals, so as a compromise, there are two strips of high quality PPS plastic on the top and bottom of the phone. These strips were initially indistinguishable from the metal in terms of looks but after a month of use, they got shinier due to the many greasy human hands that handled it. There is also a small metal strip that divides the metal and the plastics and this is where the “bump” can be felt. It is small, but when you run your hands over it, there is a legitimate bump which is probably because the plastics are a bit thicker than the metal body.. A smooth metallic body, especially with a design that favors curves on the sides of the phone, is prone to slips and falls. That’s the case with the MX5 too. A number of factors are responsible for this, like thickness, weight and the size of the phone. At 7.6mm, the phone is quite slim, so there is not much metal to grip on the sides, which is also due to the design. The weight, at 149g, is not light enough to stop a slip. As a result, you would need a case or be ok with seeing scratches on the chamfered edges and may be a dent or two on the plastic parts of the phone. But even after a couple of hard unfortunate falls, there wasn’t a single scratch on the highly polished metal, which is great and yet again shows how much of an effort has gone into it. Now, the third factor is, of course, size, which is mostly mandated by the display.. The display and its small bezels dominate the front of the phone, leaving space for the notification LED, the front facing camera and sensors at the top and the home button at the bottom. The display is a 5.5 inch full HD AMOLED screen, which not only lets Meizu achieve a thickness of 7.6mm but is also simply great in most aspects. With infinite contrast, the AMOLED screen dazzles in nearly every lighting condition. It has no problems with viewing angles or outdoor use, and is magnificent in dealing with colors.. It can go to super bright levels of brightness or tone down to a pittance when needed and covers the full gamut of the NTSC color space. Not only that, it is powered by a Miravision image processing algorithm from MediaTek. It’s like the CABC that we have seen in other flagship phones. The laminated displays have been a mainstay in Meizu’s phones but the MX5’s properly tweaked, not-too-saturated AMOLED screen takes it to the next level, despite having a pentile sub-pixel arrangement that is pronounced when using it for the rare VR experience.. Talking of experiences, the camera on the Meizu MX5 is a Sony IMX220 20.7 MP sensor with a f2.2 six element lens. It’s almost the same camera as the one of the MX4 pro but Meizu claims that it is more refined, with better algorithms. As a result, you get great pleasing photos in daylight, but the 1.2 um pixel size and f2.2 aperture don’t help much in low light, as photos tend to be shaky most of the time. Here are some camera samples for a quick glance –. Download the full resolution samples here. As you can see, the daylight photos look great, with accurate white balance and colors. The sharpening might be a little over done, but that’s highly subjective because some prefer it sharp and some soft. But if you’re looking for options to reduce image properties like sharpening or even saturation, you’re out of luck.. That’s because the camera interface is very minimal, with quick access only to modes, toggles and of course, filters. HDR photography is good, but works best with ample light and steady hands. Same goes for macro, but in all cases, even in low light, focusing is accurate and fast thanks to the laser AF unit just below the circular camera lens. It sits alongside a two-tone flash which generates a neutral color or hot or cool flashes according to the scene. More than the features, the way the laser AF unit and the flash are designed into a single unit is commendable. Also commendable is that, like most other flagships these days, the MX5 lets you take manual control of exposure in the default camera app.. ( YouTube has some issues processing Meizu MX5’s sample videos. We will update our review soon .). In terms of video, the MX5 is capable of recording upto 4K video with the new HEVC H.265 codec and also records 100 fps 720p slow motion videos, apart from the other standard resolutions and frame rates. The video quality is pretty good in 4k and surprisingly good in the slow motion mode too, because it’s quite rare to have seen decent compression in a high-framerate video in any phone except the iPhone. The MX5 is surely an exception in this case.. The 4K mode with HEVC and slo motion video are enabled by the Mediatek Helio X10 powering the MX5. The Helio X10 powers the device with 8 A53 cores running at 2.2 GHz and a PowerVR G6200 GPU that handles all the graphics duties. With 3 GB of RAM, there are no problems with multi-tasking and the full HD resolution definitely doesn’t strain the GPU for normal work.. To understand how the new Mediatek chip fares, we ran some benchmarks, whose results tell you what to expect in terms of performance –. If you had seen all the results , the pattern is quite apparent. The Helio X10 is as powerful as a Snapdragon 805, except in some GPU tests, if you need a point of reference. In normal usage, you wouldn’t notice this much because most phones are highly optimized these days and the MX5 is no exception. Day to day usage never deteriorated and the system kept going with many apps open in the background. Gaming was as expected, and overheating is not much of an issue to worry about here. Sure, the phone heats up like any other phone, but it doesn’t turn into an oven despite the metallic build, so it seems to be under control even in stressful conditions, which is completely fine.. The Helio X10 is also responsible for the 4G dual nano SIM slots in the phone. The chip has support for both the FDD LTE band 3 (1800 MHz) and LTE band 40 (2300 MHz), so it is ready for the India’s 4G pockets, and of course, both SIM slots support 4G, with all the usual management options.. Internally, storage is a concern, by default, because the MX5 doesn’t come with an expansion slot, so the in-built mass storage is all you have. Around 14.56 GB is available for the system and about 11 GB is available to the user. If needs are not met, it is highly suggested to go for higher memory variants, which are indeed costlier than the base model that costs 1799 Yuan (approx Rs. Despite this low price, the MX5 has more flagship features on board like, for example, the fingerprint sensor. MX4 Pro was the first Meizu device to sport the “mTouch” feature, but it seems to have been improved and rechristened “mtouch 2.0” for the MX5. It’s a physical button that incorporates capacitive touch and biometric fingerprint recognition underneath the glass. Meizu devices always had a single home button, so replacing it with a fingerprint sensor must have seemed fine, but it also means that there is now a dedicated notification LED above the display instead of a circular one on the capacitive home button and this new hardware button gets more protection on the inside to prevent water or sweat from seeping into the fingerprint sensor. I did miss the now-extinct soft double tap/long tap on the glow-in-the-dark home button to lock/unlock the phone, but its replacement quickly changed my mind.. Mtouch 2.0 exceeds expectations when it comes to performance. It’s wildly fast and works well even with a smudge-ridden glass, but of course you would need to give it a second chance sometimes. The accuracy levels were high and we were able to get multiple fingers registered for the fastest unlock times on this phone except those rare few times. Security wise, Meizu says you are covered, with an encrypted TEE chip on-board that locally stores all the fingerprint data and is inaccessible, by all means.. The capacitive mTouch button also acts as a back button on a single soft tap, while the hard tap of the physical button takes you to the home screen. This dual-functionality is one of the many neat UX tweaks as a part of the Flyme OS, a completely custom UI running on top of Android 5.0 Lollipop. Flyme has gained a lot of features and design tweaks since the days of the MX2, and its good to see that consistency is now more prevalent across the UI than before.. Its launcher is screens populated with apps and a lot of these default apps are delightfully minimalistic. By default, the icons have a fresh look and most of them are custom according to the app, think of it as a pre-installed icon pack. And yes, there are tons of customization options and thankfully some of the necessary Google apps come pre-loaded unlike Meizu devices sold in China. The performance of the UI is fast and fluid, mostly maintaining a high frame rate throughout, but some of the default apps did misbehave now and then, most notably the default browser. But this is Android, so there is just way too much choice to complain about things like these. Music sounds great in-ear as well as on the loudspeaker at the bottom, and watching videos is effortless, made better by the display.. Watching videos, or even just doing things, involves the draining of the battery. With 3150 mAH of capacity, the MX5 lasts for a day, but with very little charge left at the end. This has been mostly the case over the course of usually medium-to-heavy usage. The screen-on-time hovers around 3-3.5 hours for one full charge of the device, with additional payloads like continuous use of mobile internet, tethering and Twitter. So, about 18 hours of standby time is what I consistently get with the same pattern of usage. And yet again, like a true flagship, it has quick charging technology called mCharge and with its supported charger, charges the MX5 from 0 to 25% in 10 mins and to 60% in 40 mins.. It achieved an One Charge Rating of 9 hours and 46 minutes. Check out the complete set of Meizu MX5 battery test results here .. So, that’s the whole theme here. The Meizu MX5 is truly a flagship device, despite the lowly price. It’s got great design, looks beautiful, takes decent pictures with fast AF, lets you use advanced tech like fingerprint authentication and basically gives you an easily accessible flagship experience, without too many compromises. Of course you will have to cover the phone up to safeguard the precious metal and glass and deal with limited storage options if you’re on a budget (sound familiar?), but at this price Rs19,999 for the 16GB variant, the Meizu is highly recommended and should definitely be in your list of choices..

Gone are the days of $600 flagships; the latest Meizu flagship (as of writing this review; the Pro version should be out soon) costs a ‘mere’ 1799 Yuan or US$289 in China. I remember only a little over a couple of years back did I pay what now looks like a hefty sum of $275 to have an MT6577 phone shipped to me. I like to believe I wasn’t foolish back then, but there’s one thing I’m certain about — it IS the age of mid-range flagships. The term, as you read it, is an amalgamation of ‘mid-range’ and ‘flagship’; ‘mid-range’ refers to the price and the latter, to the specifications (not so much the experience, unfortunately. Since we are dealing in Chinese tech, the price is even lower than what international or mainstream OEMs would offer. In this case, the MX5 comes with acclaimed Helio X10 CPU from MediaTek… along with 3GB RAM and other impressive specifications.. Let us find out how well that translates into a good phone.. I’ve been a fan of Meizu’s design since I was shown the Meizu M6 back in 2007 or so. Nothing out of the ordinary, but I loved the simpleness that the design had to it in an era when most companies churned out devices that were made to look as complicated (‘geeky’) as possible. The MX5 however happens to be the first Meizu phone I’ve used for more than 10 minutes… and it’d be unfair to say that it has disappointed.. However, what is certain is that the design won’t blow your mind. That isn’t to say that the MX5 is a ripoff of the iPhone — it sure isn’t — but it won’t make you go around preaching Meizu’s design theory. The home button on the MX5 is now a rounded square (rounded rectangle, anyone?), after Meizu was allegedly forced to give up the glowing halo which went hand-in-hand with any Meizu phone for quite some time.. There are obvious cues from other phones, which is most apparent around the edges of the MX5… especially when you catch a glimpse of the speaker grille.. While measuring the ‘goodness’ of a design is something that’ll forever depend on who’s using it, the build of a phone will usually be in agreement by most of its users. In the case of the MX5, the device seems fairly well built with an exception or two.. It is believed that the MX5 was a bit of a hurried device. Hurried in the sense that Meizu probably didn’t invest as much time as they would usually. But the consequence of that should’ve been in the design and features and not the build.. One major gripe that I have with the MX5 is that the buttons (volume and power, not the home button) feel slightly tacky. This is because of the play or the ‘rattle’ they have in them; running a finger over the buttons even makes a sound that you don’t want to hear from something you’ve spend udwards of $300 (for international buyers) on, let alone a flagship smartphone of 2015.. Thankfully though, the home button recites a different story. There’s virtually no play or anything like that, and the fingerprint reader works like a charm (more on this later).. Take a look at some pictures of the MX5.. After only recently having used the LeTV X600 (review), I had high expectations from the MX5. The X600 comes with the MediaTek MT6795 @2.0GHz, while the variant on the MX5 actually has 10% faster clock rates. Unfortunately though — probably because of an unoptimized ROM — the MX5 doesn’t perform as well as it should (and could).. With the same amount of RAM, ROM and a higher clocked version of the same CPU, the MX5 is usually second to the LeTV X600, which is in fact the one of the three first phones from LeTV. I guess the higher expectations were called for, given Meizu’s experience making phones. It makes one wonder if the pretty ROMs that Chinese phones often flaunt are backfiring with unnecessary resource hogging.. Nonetheless, there’s more to the MX5 than just UI transitions, and thankfully it only gets better from here.. In-app performance (that is, when the ‘unnecessary’ overheads don’t play a part) is top-notch as you would expect from the CPU. RAM-heavy apps like Chrome will hang every now and then, but that’s only when you’re pushing the phone’s processing limits (as I often find myself doing, with a tonne of tabs, apps, open all at once). Give the phone a few seconds (20, give or take) and it’ll resume to normalcy. Again, this isn’t something you expect from a flagship, but it is the ROM to blame.. Meizu are promising a lot with constant firmware updates, which hopefully will eradicate the apps not responding issues and improve the general performance.. Moving on, audio performance on the MX5 deserves a special mention. The output from the earpiece as well as the built in speaker is crisp and sounds like quality sound. Often phones will output audio that’s completely bass-less and too high on treble, but the MX5 gets all of that right!. The 5.5-inch display of the MX5 has a 1920 x 1080p resolution. It isn’t the resolution that is the talking point, but the fact that it is a Super AMOLED display. Users in China have been having issues with the display, but as I’ve said before and as I will continue to say, it is the way the display has been calibrated. What might be an issue for one might actually be a feature for another.. In short, the MX5 has a fairly beautiful display with a lovely color reproduction, which can be tweaked up to an extent from within the settings. It is beautiful per se, but has strong characteristics. That is to say, put it against another Super AMOLED and you’ll know from one look which one the MX5 is. It has a slightly warm tint, and lacks the over-saturation of other Super AMOLED displays. Picture isn’t as ‘fluid’ or crisp as an IPS LCD panel, but then there’s color going for this one.. Meizu X2 Is No More A Speculation. Meizu MX5 vs Gionee Elife S7 Super AMOLED display comparison:. In one word — forgive me for being informal — the camera on the MX5 is insane. It’s a 20.7 mega-pixel Sony IMX220 sensor from the previous Meizu flagship, but with improved software algorithms and laser autofocus that takes charge of imaging on the phone.. As usual for any phone, the MX5’s camera comes loaded with features such as HDR, macro (“microspur” in the menu), depth of field, and of course, beauty mode. The macros can’t be taken from as close up as you’d like, but apart from that the MX5 is, without a spec of doubt, the best camera phone I’ve used. As you read before, this includes the X600 (Andi still seems to swear by his LeTV X600, but I’m pretty sure as and when he gets his hands on the MX5, the X600 will be history).. Every mode does justice and then more to the picture. HDR isn’t overexposed, depth of field shots have shalloe depth of field… just the right amount, without the bokeh seeming manufactured. In all, the MX5 has the camera that will — I daresay — make the most demanding users happy with its capabilities.. I’ll let the sample shots do the talking. Forgive me for not having the best framing abilities!. Although the MX5 has a 3150mAh battery and a Super AMOLED display, battery life isn’t crazy good. It is only on the verge of satisfactory… a little short of that for some.. I hardly play any games on the phone, and as other reviews of mine will tell you, use my phone mainly for communication and utility purposes. I believe with the sort of usage my phones are subjected to, one day of battery life should be a bare minimum. And the MX5 almost does that.. 4.5hrs to 4.75hrs is the kind of SOT (screen on time) the MX5 manages for me. It isn’t the best clearly, but not the worst either. This is something I would again attribute to the ROM on the device, which doesn’t seem completely optimized to extract the best from what’s given to it in hardware terms.. It does make you let go of a percentage of the lack of great battery life. According to Meizu, the mCharge technology will take the MX5 from 0-25% in just 25 minutes; from my usage, I can say that Meizu haven’t wronged their buyers.. Flyme again is a heavily skinned Android variation. It does away with the ‘Smart Bar’ that used to be the star of the show (and from what users reported, was a major contributor to the steep learning curve). Since there’s only one button on the MX5 — contrary to three on most Android phones — the home button isn’t just a home button. It combines a fingerprint sensor, back and home button into one. Of course this is a hardware implementation, but all a part of Flyme, which is why you find it in this section of the review.. Here’s how it works: from anywhere on the phone, tap (and not press) the home button like any capacitive touch button, and it’ll perform a ‘back’ action. Press the button, and it’ll take you to the home screen. Of course, there is a learning curve to it, but once you do get a hang of it you will (like me) prefer this arrangement over the usual three button setup of Android.. In order to access recent apps, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen. This can be a little tricky at first… especially when you don’t know how to deal with the running apps. Tap on one to get into the app, swipe down from within the recent apps bar to kill all apps, and tap and hold on one to ‘lock’ it into memory.. Besides the parts where the OS feels a little low on optimization, it is something that I’d use and probably prefer over AOSP Android. There’s a lot of customization options, but at the same time Meizu seem to not have done things to the ROM just for the sake of it. Coming to the fingerprint sensor: along with the camera, this is my most favourite feature of the MX5. It isn’t just super secure, but also super fast (and very accurate). It is faster than having a ‘slide to unlock’ screen, and more secure than the most complex pattern you can set on the 9/16-dot grid of Android. But like I mentioned earlier, you will want to have dry fingers before attempting to unlock your phone.. The very impressive anti-fingerprint/oleophobic coating that is spread on the screen and around the home button seems to be missing from the fingerprint sensor, but I’m not complaining.. Buy the MX5 if you’re a photography enthusiast, you won’t be disappointed. Buy the MX5 if you’re looking for a fairly well built phone with a fingerprint sensor, and you’ll be happy. But don’t buy the MX5 (at least just yet) for the promise of the Helio X10. If possible, wait for a month or so until Flyme OS is tuned to give the SoC what it needs. And when that happens, I’m pretty sure the MX5 will blow every $289 out of the water.. Despite the couple shortcomings, I believe the MX5 will be my daily driver for quite a while. It’s sleeker than the X600, has a killer camera, and a bomb of a fingerprint sensor. We would like to thank the folks at CooliCool.com for providing the Meizu MX5 for this review!.
