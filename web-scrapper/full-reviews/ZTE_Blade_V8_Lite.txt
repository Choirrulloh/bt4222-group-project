The Blade V8 Lite is made of metal and is built around a 5" IPS screen of 720p resolution. The phone is powered by the MT6750 chipset, which may be aging and borderline mediocre, but is becoming quite a popular choice among the manufacturers.. The ZTE Blade V8 Mini is keeping the nice design, but brings a Snapdragon 430 chipset, a bigger battery, and a dual main camera with a secondary 2MP sensor for depth information.

Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 03/03/2017. While Chinese manufacturers are a commonplace in the android market space itâs quite surprising a brand name like ZTE doesnât seem to stand out outside of its home market unlike Huawei or even Xiaomi. That being said ZTE has some competitive offerings too such as the Blade V8 Lite which is a supposedly cut down version of the Blade V8. However, it still does have noteworthy specs for users who donât have unreasonable demands. Starting with its specs the ZTE Blade V8 Lite sports a Mediatek MT6750 SoC unlike its bigger brother which has a Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC, it also has 2GB of memory and 16GB of storage.. In terms of its chassis design the ZTE Blade V8 Lite is quite elegantly designed making it look and feel premium, because of its metal casing users can be rest assure that it will remain rigid without flexing too much. One noticeable thing most manufacturers seem to do these days is the awkward location of the fingerprint reader which is located on the back of the casing, never mind the non-removable battery but it does feel awkward to have a single indent on the back of the casing just for a simple feature. As this device is designed for the budget price bracket users shouldnât expect too much from it other than being sufficiently powerful enough for a typical user needs.. The equipped screen is of a IPS HD panel which is about expected for a device of this price. Brightness of the display is about satisfactory and so is color reproduction and vibrancy. Overall the display does its job without diminishing its purpose. While most budget phones these days are starting to have a rear dual camera setup this isnât the case for the ZTE Blade V8 Lite as it only has an 8 MP rear and a 5MP front camera which isnât really disappointing although what is disappointing is its relatively low megapixel count since even within this price bracket there are devices with 10 or 13MP rear and front cameras. As for the picture quality under good lighting conditions the ZTE Blade V8 Lite does perform substantially well however as with most budget phones low lighting conditions does affect its quality. Moving over to the battery the ZTE Blade V8 Lite is equipped with a 2500mAh battery which is about the average, itâs no large battery by any means but with hardware that barely sips power users can expect reasonable runtimes.
