Mobiles / XOLO Mobile Phones / XOLO Q710s Price in India. User Visits: 4 Launch Date in India: 30 November, 2014 Compare. Finally, Xolo has made the much-needed plunge in the budget segment with a direct competitor to Moto E named Q710s. It is such a needed step from Xolo as there is absolutely no alternative to Moto E, apart from Zenfone 4, that can compete against Motorola's offering on equal terms. Micromax did throw the unite 2 at Moto E, but it failed on build quality and fit and finish departmnets. Is Xolo able to do with Q710s what Micromax was unable to with unite 2?. The Xolo Q710s runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat and comes with dual-SIM support as well. A 1.3GHz quad-core processor does duties on the Q710s along with 1GB RAM. A 4.5-inch screen has been put up on the Xolo Q710s and it puts out display resolution of 960x540 pixels. An 8-megapixel camera on the back and a 1.3-megapixel snapper up front can be found on the Q710s. There is 8GB inbuilt storage provided by Xolo on Q710s and it can be expanded up to 32GB using a microSD card. A 2000mAH capacity battery can be found powering the Xolo Q710s and the smartphone should survive 22 hours of talktime before finally running out of juice. It is no surprise that only Xolo(for now) is able to compete against Motorola Moto E among the indian smartphone makers. It has focused on making devices which are great on build quality and fit and finish fronts while also being good on hardware front. Xolo has been hard at work to improve its reputation in the Indian smartphone market and it shows with Q710s as well. However, Xolo still stands to lose as Moto E has by now taken most of the customers to itself, leaving Xolo to contend with new smartphone buyers and those who are looking to change their old smartphones. Still, the Q710s holds a lot of promise for Xolo and should be taken seriously by customers and Motorola alike.. 3 /5 (34 User Reviews). 4,299 (Expected Price) XOLO Q710s is currently not available in any online store..

Want to give my old phone to my Personal Assistant, with the hope that if we both continue to synchronise and update BOTH phones to the account, we will they be able to maintain and update the SAME set of contacts. Really hope so, and if so Phone Copy is even better than expected!. as long as you both sync the phones against the same account, the contacts will be synchronized. The system is also able to handle collisions - changes of the same contact from both phones. You can easily review all changes on PhoneCopy website.

You can also use our Groups feature which is intended for advanced users and hidden by default (see Settings -> Groups, there is a short help for it).

Hello, we slightly changed the login screen in recent version of our application.. Now you have to check at least one local contact database to sync the contacts with. The most common choice is "Local Contacts" or simply "contacts".. If you do not see anything on the login screen, try to create one contact in the phone (choose the proper database) and repeat the login process. Sometimes app cannot detect empty contact database. PhoneCopy support team , 15/09/2014. Phone copy is syncing my gmail a/c contacts but not my local phonebook contacts from device and sim. Hi, in the application under Account & Settings button you need to select existing user and on following screen you can select or change contact database (also called provider). Then you will be able to synchronize other contact databases as well. PhoneCopy support team , 04/09/2014. Thanks for the reply but i am not able to figure out the Accounts & Settings button in android app. Sorry, exact name of the account is Advanced and Account. PhoneCopy support team , 04/09/2014. I accidentally said "yes" when phone copy asked me if I wanted to synch my SMS. I don't want to delete them from my phone but they send me over the limit for phonecopy...how do I remove the synch of just SMS?. Under Account and Settings you select Existing User and on next screen you can switch off SMS synchronization. Then you can delete SMS from the server to fit limits. PhoneCopy support team , 01/09/2014. I have been into account settings...there is no option to select existing user and I've looked everywhere for the SMS off switch...my only setting options are Basic settings Password change, Groups, Devices, Subscription, Account termination.. Would it be somewhere else? I looked under each and see nothing... Sorry, you have to user Account and Settings button in the android application. PhoneCopy support team , 02/09/2014. I recently "upgraded" to the latest version 2.4.10, but now it takes several minutes instead of less than one minute to sync. It seems to be trying to recreaate every text and contact every time I sync instead of just updating the ones that have changed. This is not really an acceptable performance degradation. The older version worked perfectly, and also told me what contacts/texts were added/deleted, which the latest version doesn't seem to do either. the thing you describe is "slow sync". This type of sync occurs only after login to app, it transfers all contacts and sms from phone and server and merges them. Because it transfers all items it takes a longer time. Next time, after the "slow sync" will be "fast sync" and it transfers only changes from phone or server, therefore it is faster then the previous one.. This behavior is the same as in previous versions of PhoneCopy.. We know that your last five synchronizations were "slow sync". But unfortunately, since you are the first user who this issue reports, currently we don't know the reason. We tested it, but for us it works on all devices.. Please, try to re-login ("Advanced & Account" > "Use existing account" > Select an account you want to sync and then press Login. First time sync will be "slow sync" and another one should be already "fast sync".. If your issue persists or not, please, send us your feedback. PhoneCopy support team , 01/09/2014. I somehow also synced that to phonecopy. So I have lost all contacts. How can I restore them from say.. visit deleted contacts page at https://www.phonecopy.com/en/contact/deleted. All removed contacts are shown, sorted by the time of deletion.. Just select all the contacts you want to restore. You can use the check-box in the upper-left corner of the list to change selection of all displayed contacts, also clicking with Shift or Ctrl works as expected.. Once all contacts are restored, sync your phone and they will be transferred back to the phone. PhoneCopy support team , 25/08/2014. I Wonder if i Upgrade to Premium, will that restore deleted and sendt sms before 30 days?. All sms stored in your account will be uploaded back to phone. 30 days limit is defined to Deleted items only and can be applied to reduce number of your deleted items. PhoneCopy support team , 20/08/2014. Forgot to say that after Upgrade, i only get error Message, and i se that there is 2 acounts With sms., can i add i now yoy only synk from espensjo. The problem that occurred was caused by the version PhoneCopy that you are currently using. The actual stable version 2.2.13 is not able to write SMS on phones with Android KitKat (4.4.x / your version is 4.4.2) because new restrictions were added in KitKat that were not in previous versions of Android. We have prepared a new beta version 2.4.9 which is ready for Android KitKat and already fully supports synchronization of SMS.. - from blue link on main screen (above the synchronize button in the PhoneCopy app). - or directly from https://www.phonecopy.com/android/download/PhoneCopy.apk. After install of the beta do relogin in app ("Advanced & Account" > "Use existing account" > Add an account you want to sync and then press Login button). PhoneCopy support team , 21/08/2014.
