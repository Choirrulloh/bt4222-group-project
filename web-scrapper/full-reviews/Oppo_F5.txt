The latest device in OPPO’s “selfie expert” series will be made available in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, though details of what the handset will offer are currently scarce.. OPPO has revealed only a few bits of information about that the F5 (which we received via email), most notably that it will feature a FHD+ display with 2160 x 1080 resolution and “AI beauty recognition technology.”. OPPO says the F5 will use the AI to “beautify” selfie shots, learning the “the unique facial features of a subject (for example: the nose, cheek, lower jaw etc.), to make the best enhancements for each image, regardless of the facial expressions or shooting angle.”. The AI component is also said to understand the differences between age and gender, to make the most appropriate tweaks for each subject, and will self-learn to improve future pictures. For those wishing to take high quality selfies with minimal effort, this sounds like it could be the device for you.. We’ll have more on the F5’s price, specs and release date details coming your way in a couple of weeks. For now, what’s your thoughts on the Oppo F5? Let us know in the comments..

CRITIC REVIEW Oppo F5 review: It’s all about the selfies. NEW DELHI: Let’s face it: there’s no escaping the selfie phenomena. No matter how much you may cringe looking at adults or teenagers – in public places especially – giving it their best shot to capture the perfect selfie, better learn to live with it. The selfie is here to stay and perhaps that’s why brands are catering to this “rage”. A brand which has consistently made selfie centric smartphones and carved its name in the smartphone market is Oppo F5 Design and Display The Oppo F5 is a big phone but surprisingly doesn’t feel that big once you start using it. It’s a smartphone that grows on you. The review unit we got was warm gold which comes with a matte metallic texture. To give it a premium look, Oppo has gone for a chrome ring which runs around the phone’s sides. There’s an iPhone 7 kind of look and feel to the phone. Even if you’re fussy about the looks of the smartphone, Oppo F5 should satisfy your need of a good-looking device. It’s not a phone which will make you go wow but it’s nothing to scoff at either. -Excellent front camera -Impressive display -Smooth performance. Oppo F5 User Reviews & Rating.

Few phone-makers are as selfie-obsessed as Oppo.. However, it’s more than just that. The Oppo F5 is one of the more affordable phones to feature the ultra-thin screen surround design now commonplace among top-end mobiles. Judging by its price in India, the Oppo F5 is likely to cost around £250, with its closest rival the Moto G5S Plus .. While it isn’t better than the G5S Plus all-round, this is a solid alternative for those looking for something a little different.. It’s the Oppo F5’s screen that you’ll notice first. Almost its entire front is display, similar to the. While there’s still some surround to the left and right of the screen compared to, say, a Samsung Galaxy S8 , you’re in effect getting a 6-inch display in a shell size you’d see with a 5.5-inch display.. The Oppo F5 is also slender at only 7.5mm thick and it’s quite light, too, at 152g.. Unlike the Moto G5S Plus, the Oppo F5 isn’t metal. It took me a few days to come to this realisation, however. The curved back of the F5 is silver nano-coated plastic. Nano coatings are generally used in phones to provide water resistance, yet the F5 has no official waterproofing, so it’s best to think of this phone as a particularly good plastic design.. In this regard it’s a little like the HTC U Life, whose back is acrylic plastic but doesn’t look or feel too bad next to its more expensive glass siblings.. The Oppo F5 also manages to squeeze in a few other features that are more commonplace on high-end devices. There’s a decent fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone (it may be a reach for small hands) and, like the iPhone X, you can unlock the phone with your face.. This is closer to the face unlock we’ve seen in Android for years than the IR-based approach Apple employs, relying primarily on the front camera. However, thanks to the high-quality sensor Oppo uses for the selfie camera, the feature works surprisingly well.. In general, it’s pretty fast and even handles dimmer lighting without falling over – although, predictably, it isn’t as reliable or secure as Apple’s version, seemingly struggling with glasses on occasion.. The Oppo F5 has a 6-inch screen. An older display design of this size would have resulted in a pretty sizeable phone. But here that diagonal is only so long because the panel is more ‘widescreen’ than that of your average budget phone.. This is an 18:9 aspect screen with 2160 x 1080 resolution. Most call this ‘Full HD+’, because it’s effectively standard Full HD with some extra pixels to accommodate the elongated shape.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Playing such games, there’s greater room for virtual controls, helping to keep them out of the way of the action. For movies it’s simply closer to the aspect ratios commonly used by films that end up in the cinema.. Play 16:9 content in, say, BBC iPlayer, and the Oppo F5 will just leave some black bars to the left and right of the image. Display quality is typical of a lower-mid range phone: very good but a level below the best. The Oppo F5 uses an LTPS IPS panel, and as such, colour depth isn’t at the level of an OLED or high-end LCD. However, after initially finding certain tones a bit washed out, my eyes adjusted to the style within a day or two. The Moto G5S Plus offers slightly better image quality, but has a more traditional 16:9 screen.. If you’re extremely picky about screens, you should mote that Oppo doesn’t include any kind of display customisation options.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

"Trendy" tends to get thrown around on today's mobile scene quite a lot. It is just one of those loose-fitting adjectives that, through overuse, has practically lost all meaning. Still, looking at the Oppo F5, we can't really think of any better way to describe the company's new "selfie expert".. It literally covers all the current trends: Trim bezels, ultra-wide aspect, AI-powered selfies, Apple-style face unlock and heavily iOS-inspired UI - all accounted for. All the while, concepts like a dual selfie setup have already been pushed to the side, just to stay in tune with the tone of the day.. We get it, being trendy and staying relevant is important, especially in an increasingly over-saturated market. The BBK Electronic Corporation really seems to take that idea to heart, as the Vivo V7+ and the OnePlus 5T can both testify, with their equally speedy adoptions on the trendy ultra-wide aspect ratio.. Still, we can't really fault Oppo for adapting and surviving as best it can. With its FullHD panels, slick design, new software and camera features and revamped UI, it still offers great mid-range value in its own right.. But, that definitely doesn't mean we can't frown at the phone's polycarbonate unibody - a clear downgrade over its F3 predecessor. Or be a little saddened by the constant sharp shifts in design direction within the "selfie expert" family, as well as the overpowering ambition to copy Apple's every step as close as copyright laws allow and perhaps even beyond.. One things is for sure, there are a lot of new aspects of the Oppo F5 to explore. So, without further ado, join us on the following pages as we tour the handset and see exactly what has changed..

The company practically kick-started the selfie phone craze with the F3, so people have a very high regard for its successor, the OPPO F5. But nobody stays on top forever. Can the newcomer, the Vivo V7+ , take on OPPO's pride and glory in the selfie expert range?. Left: OPPO F5 | Right: Vivo V7+. These two phones are definitely competing on the same battlefield. Both phones have a large 6-inch 18:9 "FullView" display, a selfie focus and similar pricing, so it'll be a very tight comparison. That said, there are some key differentiators between the two phones.. The OPPO F5 packs a 6-inch FHD+ display protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Its resolution is also greater at 2,160 x 1,080 pixels. This gives it an advantage over the Vivo V7+ which has a slightly smaller 5.99-inch display with a much lower resolution, 1,440 x 720 pixels. The V7+ is also protected by Gorilla Glass 3 only. This is clearly in the F5's favor.. The F5 packs a MediaTek Helio P23 processor, which is generally a better, more expensive chipset than the V7+'s Snapdragon 450. MediaTek actually had to slash prices on the P23 to compete with the Snapdragon 450, and generally the P23 has the faster CPU processor and the better GPU. That said, Qualcomm's Snapdragon line is more popular and gets better support from developers, and game developers prefer to optimize for the Adreno GPU the Snapdragon 450 has over the Helio P23's Mali-G71. So this part is a bit of a wash.. Left: OPPO F5 | Right: Vivo V7+. The real test though is in the cameras. The F5 has a 16-megapixel f/1.8 rear camera, while the V7+ touts a similar 16-megapixel f/2.0 camera. On paper the F5 has a slight advantage with its larger aperture, but the real test is in the selfie cameras. The F5 uses a 20-megapixel f/2.0 camera and has AI Beautification Technology filters, while the V7+ uses a 24-megapixel f/2.0 lens with Moonlight Glow. While the V7+ has the advantage on paper, in practice the F5 produces better shots with its software filters.. Left: OPPO F5 | Right: Vivo V7+. The rest of the specifications are generally in favor of the V7+, with twice the internal storage (64 GB to the F5's 32 GB) and a slightly larger battery (3,225 mAh over 3,200 mAh). But the final clincher is the price: the F5 goes for PHP 15,990, while the V7+ is significantly more expensive at PHP 17,990. In the end, that may be the true decider of this contest..

6-inch FHD+ display, 2160 x 1080 pixel resolution, ~402ppi. 32GB internal storage, expandable via microSD. Pricing and Availability of OPPO F5. OPPO F5 is the company’s entry to the growing population of smartphones with an 18:9 aspect ratio. And more importantly, this is the company’s way of gearing up for the upcoming holiday season, and not being dragged down by the competition.. Aside from its 6-inch FHD+ screen, the OPPO F5 also touts an AI-powered selfie camera, MediaTek’s latest midrange processor, and a facial recognition feature. Are these features enough to blow the competition out in the water? Let’s figure that out in our OPPO F5 review.. Right off the bat, the OPPO F5 a refreshing design — or at least, for an OPPO handset.. The seamless transition of the back panel to the sides, the shiny antenna bands, and the curved corners made it look a bit identical to the OPPO R11. But thanks to its unusual form and shape, the F5 looks a little less like the earlier OPPO devices before it.. Actually, the OPPO F5’s isn’t really one of a kind. The device looks very identical to its archenemy, the Vivo V7+. Besides having a tall, 6-inch display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, the two smartphones share a lot of identical physical features.. For one, the OPPO F5 is also made of plastic. Despite how gorgeous, and metal-like it looks, this thing’s rear cover is made of plastic which is painted to look premium. And just like in our Vivo V7+ review , I barely noticed its second-rate material construction. The device has this premium metal look to it, without the heavy metal weight.. Its sleek design, lightweight, curvy corners and edges make the OPPO F5 look beautiful in my eyes. It’s also really ergonomic to use. However, since it has a tall screen, reaching for the top frame is quite impossible to do single-handedly. That’s considering I have large hands and fingers myself. I can’t access the Notifications tab without using my other hand, or running my fingers all the way up.. Like I said earlier, the F5’s highlight feature is its tall screen. Its 18:9 aspect ratio display is almost borderless, which populates the front of the device with nothing but screen. OPPO was still able to cram in the 20-megapixel sensor on top, together with the other necessary sensors and the earpiece.. However, the space at the chin of the OPPO F5 isn’t roomy enough to house the fingerprint scanner, so it’s been relocated to the back. Meanwhile, the capacitive buttons were also shifted to be on-screen.. The fingerprint sensor at the back is placed right above the reflective and metallic OPPO logo. It is easily reachable by the index finger and it falls naturally once the user gets used to it.. On the left side, we have the volume controls while the right houses the lock/power button below the SIM tray. The buttons have an ultra-thin profile with great tactility and it still feels satisfying to press.. Moreover, there’s a noise-canceling microphone on top while at the bottom we have the other built-in mic, the 3.5mm headphone jack, and the loudspeaker.. Overall, I really admire the design of the OPPO F5. It would have been better if they used metal instead of plastic, though. But for me, personally, I like my smartphone light and easy to carry.. Another visual highlight of the OPPO F5 is its display.. What we’re seeing here is a 6-inch FHD+ IPS display, with a high pixel density of 402. The unusual screen resolution was due to its 18:9 aspect ratio, a display feat that more and more companies are starting to adapt.. The screen delivers a standard performance for an IPS panel. The colors are good with deep blacks and average whites. Saturation is just average so it doesn’t exaggerate nor downgrade the color fidelity.. Watching movies, playing games, or browsing through pictures on social media is good on this screen. Using the OPPO F5 on landscape mode delivers a more immersive experience. Also, reading materials from websites and what not is a joy on this screen as you don’t have to scroll a lot because there’s more content to be seen by default.. Moreover, the screen panel also delivers enough backlighting to make it still usable during broad daylight. Viewing angles are also not the best, but acceptable and more than enough.. Unlike the V7+, the OPPO F5 doesn’t have a dedicated HiFi chip that ensures impressive audio output. But that doesn’t mean that the sound that’s coming out of this device is terrible. In lieu of a hardware chip, the F5 is equipped with a Real Sound Technology which basically works like a native equalizer in the settings menu. It does improve the sound output, but it’s nothing like a built-in DAC.. Plugging in the included earphones delivers decent performance. The treble is acceptable, the bass is present, although they aren’t thumping. The volume is decent for listening in an empty room, although it might not be that audible when traveling or in a noisy environment.. I did plug in some decent pair of cans, and unsurprisingly, it sounded way better.. On the other hand, the loudspeaker of the OPPO F5 performed better than the bundled earphones. It has some really loud volume that can fill a small, quiet room. Both the treble and bass are acceptable, although the mids are a bit harsh.. Just this August, MediaTek announced their new midrange SoCs, the Helio P23, and P30. And now, we’re seeing the said Helio P23 chipset on the OPPO. This device is rigged with a 2.5GHz octa-core 16nm processor, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of expandable storage.. The chipset holds up pretty well during my test. The octa-core processor and 4GB of RAM handled almost any app really well. Browsing through the interface, social media apps, and Google Chrome were seamless. Although there were some very occasional stutters, those are to be expected for a midrange smartphone like this.. The OPPO F5’s multitasking capabilities are also impressive. You can switch between apps, from the basic to high-intensive ones, without breaking a sweat. You can also use some of them, side-by-side, with its Split Screen feature.. Moving on, gaming on the OPPO F5 is also satisfying. Besides the immersiveness brought by its display, the processor also assures that it will project games with good frame rates. Playing games like Stacks and Mario Run, up to some graphically intensive ones like UFC and NBA Live are pretty enjoyable without noticeable hiccups.. I did notice some stutters on UFC’s menu screen and home page, but nothing too alarming. And since it runs with an internet connection on, it might just be a latency issue on our network.. MediaTek Helio P23 is also said to be more efficient than its predecessors which contributes to a better battery performance despite the increase in power. CorePilot 4.0 technology helps a lot because it has Energy Awareness Intelligent Scheduling.. See also: OPPO A71 Review. Thanks to the iPhone X, facial recognition on smartphones are starting to go mainstream. The OPPO F5 has the said security feature, but it doesn’t have the elaborate sensors that the iPhone X has. But still, the feature works surprisingly well.. The OPPO F5 utilizes the 20-megapixel front camera for scanning the face. And despite that, it still worked well. The device instantly scans my facial features, without having to literally put the device straight up on my face. During my testing, it had a 90% success rate of recognizing my face correctly.. The scanning technology also works well in a pitch black room, for as long as the screen is bright enough to act and light up your face.. I also tried showing it a picture of mine, and it intelligently refused to recognize it.. But if you’re the traditional kind, you can opt for the fingerprint scanner at the back. And just like the previous OPPO devices that I have tested, the scanner on this thing is insanely fast. It can instantly unlock the device in a mere 0.2 seconds, even when the screen is off.. But if you cant choose what to use, you can have the facial recognition and fingerprint scanner security features active at the same time.. The OPPO F5 gets to have the company’s new ColorOS 3.2, with Google’s Android 7.1 at its core. The new interface brings new features that will utilize the F5’s characters, plus other subtle changes to mark its newness.. The ColorOS 3.2 still has that iOS look and feel to it, which is now more evident as the Control Center has been separated from the Notification tabs. With this version of ColorOS, you can now have access to quick controls by swiping upwards from the bottom of the screen, which is more ergonomic considering the device’s tall display.. It would have been nice to have the volume control slider on the Control Center, but we’re not seeing it here. Although, what we have here is a new feature called OPPO Share, which basically OPPO’s take on Apple’s Airdrop. It lets you send files to any compatible OPPO device 100x faster than Bluetooth (probably via WiFi). The feature also toggles the Bluetooth antenna, so you can still receive files from other Android devices.. Moreover, the OPPO F5’s ColorOS 3.2 also introduces new native apps icons and a “secured” keyboard when typing passwords. Unfortunately, the Split Screen mode only works on most native and Google apps. There’s also a game mode that lets you block distracting notifications to help you focus playing games.. You can also take continuous screenshots, clone apps for easier multi-account management, and have easy access to Night Mode to protect your eyes from extreme blue light exposure.. And since the OPPO F5 belongs to the company’s F-series of smartphones, the device has feature-packed selfie capabilities. OPPO skipped the dual front camera setup and focused on the new technologies working behind the scenes. The OPPO F5 has a 20-megapixel front camera, combined with an AI-powered beauty mode.. Together with MediaTek Helio P23’s Imagiq 2.0 technology, OPPO F5 was equipped with advanced photography features which enabled it to have significantly better imaging prowess when compared to its predecessor.. The Face Beauty mode had been present in previous OPPO smartphones and in other competing midrange devices. However, the company wants to separate the F5 by incorporating AI with it. When the said picture mode is activated, OPPO’s “complex algorithms” analyzes your face, so it can apply the right skin enhancement filters.. What’s more interesting is, it can also alter the contours of your face. And during my tests, the AI Face Beauty does work like what OPPO claims, although it’s still not perfect.. As you can see in the samples below, my face still looks a bit natural — as if no filter was added. That’s when the Face Beauty is in auto mode. But when its set to the highest level, you can already notice that it’s, indeed, just a synthetic effect.. I also noticed that my jaw is slightly more symmetrical. You wouldn’t notice it at first glance, but if you examine the image closely, you’d see the difference from the original.. The front camera of the OPPO F5 also has a Bokeh/Portrait mode. And unlike their previous attempts, it’s slightly better this time for as long as you set it correctly, and give the device a second or two to figure that out, it will result in a more believable effect. Your face will be separated from the background, but still with some minor lapses on sides, especially in the hair area.. But even when the AI Face Beauty is off, the selfie camera works really well. The images taken looks bright, with good colors and contrast, impressive sharpness, and decent dynamic range.. With its wide aperture of f/2.0 and an on-screen flash feature, taking pictures at low-light scenarios are also possible.. We also have the 16-megapixel primary camera at the back. During a bright, sunny day, the sensor can take great pictures. The colors appear natural, contrast is average, and just like most smartphone cameras, the dynamic range is nothing to write home about.. The device also has poor low-light performance. Noise and grains are just everywhere. But depending on your preference, the images taken are still fairly usable.. The OPPO F5 is also guilty of trying to oversharpen the images. It’s barely noticeable if you’re just looking at it on a smartphone. But zooming in on a large monitor shows the muddy evidence of oversharpening.. But overall, I’m pretty satisfied with the camera’s performance.. The OPPO F5 is powered by a 3200mAh battery. It might not be an ideal size to complement its large 6-inch FHD+ screen, but considering the power-efficiency promises of the new MediaTek Helio P23 processor, there’s really not much to worry about.. And during my tests, the battery did deliver impressive performance. In a whole day of casual use — internet browsing through 4G LTE, sending messages and listening to music — I ended up with about 25% to 35% battery juice left before the night comes to a close.. PCMark’s battery tests also garnered an average of 9 hours and 20 minutes of screen-on time before the battery reached 20%. That’s almost 1-hour shy than the V7+’s result. But that’s understandable since it has a slightly bigger battery and a lower resolution.. The OPPO F5 can run on two nano SIM cards. Both of which can support 4G LTE. I haven’t experienced any issues with while browsing the internet via LTE. For as long as there’s 4G reception in the area, the connection was fast and reliable on the device’s part.. With the help of the new MediaTek Helio P23 CPU, the device is capable of going to LTE on both SIM cards instead of a single one like on the previous models.. I also have no complaints when it comes to call quality. I can hear the voice of the person I’m talking to clearly from the earpiece, even when there’s considerable noise in the surroundings. It also appears that the dual microphone setup picked up my voice well as I didn’t encounter any complaints from the other party on the line.. The Bluetooth v4.2 antenna didn’t show any problems connecting to my wireless speaker and headphones as well. There’s no noticeable latency or distortion even from afar. The WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n also connected seamlessly on our wireless network.. The OPPO F5 is a refreshing product from the company, in many different ways. Unlike their previous releases, OPPO got pretty close on getting the right blend on this one. The OPPO F5 offers a pretty compelling and acceptable value for the price, despite falling short on some areas.. The huge 6-inch 18:9 screen with a sharp FHD+ resolution is probably the best display you can get for a midrange device. The freshly baked Helio P23 processor handles every task impressively as well. The Beauty Mode on its 20-megapixel camera turned to be a little less like a gimmick thanks to its AI accomplice. Images taken with AI turned on proved to be a little better as compared to the auto mode.. I also liked the new facial recognition feature. It introduced me to a new way of unlocking my smartphone, effectively. And of course, the impressive battery longevity is the icing on the cake.. However, the OPPO F5 is not without its flaws. For one, the use of plastic is a major turn off. For this price tag, we should already be expecting a top-of-the-line, premium-made smartphone. Also, it would be nice to see OPPO bring importance to their device’s audio capabilities.. Overall, the OPPO F5 is an interesting device. And if you’re shopping in the midrange section, this is one of the few smartphones that you should be looking at.. The OPPO F5 has a price tag of.

I used to be fan of Flipkart since last many years but now I shop only from OnlyMobiles if ever I want to buy mobiles. Their 30 days price guarantee is simply awesome. You can buy product, wait for some time to get the price drop and then claim it. I have got refund 3 times and I am very happy the way, they are handling customer queries. I have been using Oppo F5 since last 12 days and here is my little original customer review. F5 has full view display with very high resolution screen color quality. Watching 4k videos are breeze on this phone. Even while watching youtube videos on slower internet connection speed - I did not experience any performance lags. The display is protected by the gorilla glass but I still prefer to use 2mm tempered glass over it. Camera is super especially during day light. Though company has provided the selfie flash but I find that in low light pictures are having a little bit of noise in images. Selfies are pretty wide angle and the front 20MP camera is never fail to miss to take the perfect selfies. Another good thing about Oppo F5 is it also has a memory card slot. I am using Airtel and Jio sim cards and Sandisk 64GB memory card inside. Access to file manager is pretty fast and videos opening faster than any other phone. Oppo F5 has 3200 mAh battery. Which lasts for the full day and I did not have any problem and I can use the phone full day without any charging. Besides, the phone comes with 2A output fast charger which reduces the charging time and the phone does not take much time to full charge.. By himanshu thakur on 21 November 2017. I wanted to buy the black colour and only they have the black colour in stock - when I have ordered. After using it for almost a week - Below are my opinion about Oppo F5. 01) Pretty fast performance - 4GB RAM works very smooth. 02) Superb metal finish of the mobile - it creates a very nice impression on others also. Almost all my friends have asked me about the model and the brand. 03) Camera performance is just awesome and better than my last Sony Xperia mobile. 04) Fullview display is just great.

Between Vivo V7 Oppo F5 and the xiaomi MI Max 2 , I mean if you are a great selfie enthusiast go for the go for the Vivo or Oppo but if you are like me huh kinda don't like to spend more money and get a less value for money so. the Moto x4 is great purchase given the fact that Moto X4's. selfie camera is more than capable for most people out there and also to mention the ip68 water resistance which barely any phone have in this price segment. But the MI Max 2 is the different story I mean it is a very huge phone so if you want a huge phone with a huge battery in Moto X4 all the Oppo Vivo doesn't stand tall in front of this beast from xiaomi.

It is probably the best selfie camera for the price in current market of 2017. 16 MP back camera is of fine quality too. Another exclusive feature is its 6 inch full HD+ display which will surely provide some fine and comfortable viewing experience. 4 GB RAM together with 2.5 GHz octa-core CPU ensures fine performance. Both facial unlock and fingerprints are there for unlocking it which is a pretty cool security feature. However, Oppo F5 is missing some expected features such as Corning Gorilla Glass protection and fast charging. The battery backup is quite low as well which is probably the biggest disadvantage of Oppo F5. For such a device the battery feature is actually quite surprising and this can make the phone lose a lot of potential customers.. User Rating: 3.27 ( 108 votes).

Another exclusive feature is its 6 inch full HD+ display which will surely provide some fine and comfortable viewing experience. 4 GB RAM together with 2.5 GHz octa-core CPU ensures fine performance. Both facial unlock and fingerprints are there for unlocking it which is a pretty cool security feature. However, Oppo F5 is missing some expected features such as Corning Gorilla Glass protection and fast charging. The battery backup is quite low as well which is probably the biggest disadvantage of Oppo F5. For such a device the battery feature is actually quite surprising and this can make the phone lose a lot of potential customers.. User Rating: 3.27 ( 108 votes).

Mobiles / Oppo Mobile Phones / Oppo F5 Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 25,448 Compare. The Oppo F-series is popularly known as the Selfie Experts series, all thanks to the smartphones it offers with impressive front cameras. The Oppo F5 takes this goodness to the next level with an AI-powered front camera. It also becomes one of those premium smartphones which feature a thin-bezel design along with a tall form-factor. The F5 is a successor to the Oppo F3, which has already raised the benchmarks for the camera-centric phones. Does the Oppo F5 take those standards forward? Let’s see.. Impressive display: The Oppo F5 flaunts a 6-inch screen with a screen resolution of 1,080 x 2,048 pixels (Full-HD+), which makes it better than the Vivo V7 Plus in the display department.

A fingerprint sensor has also been provided for added convenience.. Loaded specs sheet: The Oppo F5 comes with a Tru-Octa Core processors clocking at 2.5GHz and placed upon a MediaTek MT6763T chipset.

AI-powered front camera: A 16MP rear camera with f/1.8 aperture and an LED flash has been provided at the back. But what steals the show is the 20MP front camera which comes with an AI-powered technology that drastically improves your selfies by using 200 positioning spots to enhance the symmetry between different elements of your face to create a perfect and natural selfie.. Facial recognition: Oppo F5 brings the facial recognition technology that lets you unlock the device using your face. Although it might not be as secure as the Apple's True Depth camera, but is a cool feature to have on your smartphone.. Awkward placement of the fingerprint sensor: The fingerprint sensor is placed at the back in the upper portion. Considering the tall design, it becomes a bit difficult to reach the fingerprint sensor while you are using the device with one hand..

Amid the crowd of journalists and tech bloggers, the Oppo F5 was unveiled, which happens to be the newest smartphone in the Oppo family. The Oppo F5 launch ceremony had Nepal idols and few celebrities from the Nepali film industry. Having them as the witnesses and with the performances from the Nepal idols, the program unveiled the specs and the price of the Oppo F5.. Oppo came with the tagline “Camera Phones”, which revamped to “Selfie expert” last year. Now boasting themselves as the expert in taking selfies and leader in the business, they have now changed their tagline to “Selfie expert and leader”. The new Oppo F5 features the most hyped AI-powered selfie camera and bezel-less display with 18:9 aspect ratio. But what more it has to offer? Let’s find out.. I get to have a quick play with Oppo F5 in the launch event and will share what I experienced so far with the device. With three smartphones stacked together, the red variant looked vibrant and catchy, which also happens to be the premium variant among the bunch with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. So I picked the device and used it for a while.. The device was thin and light with a streamlined body, which made it easier to hold and to have a grip on. The 6-inch display with narrow bezels was the feature that takes all the credit for its elegance. The phone was powered by Helio P23 chipset aided by Mali-G71 MP2 for the graphics portion. On my quick play with the device, I could not test the phone’s performance with the heavy games. However, with the light apps and games in play and multitasking with them, the phone was quite fluent.. Since Oppo F5 is the camera-centric phone, I concentrated on testing its camera for most of the time. The rear 20MP camera takes decent photos at times but lacked the consistency on providing good images in every scenario. The photos were washed out sometimes and sometimes the images turn out to be over saturated. And in the low light scenario, the phone suffered highly. In addition, while I tried to record videos, the phone lacked the 4K recording option. A camera-centric smartphone with such blemishes, is it tolerable? I think no.. Similarly, to experience the Artificial Intelligence on the selfies from the self-proclaimed selfie expert and leader, I took few selfies. On taking selfies, my brown-colored skin tone was whitened, which looked natural most of the times. However, the shots taken with the Bokeh mode lacked sharped edges almost all the time. Also, the background was unevenly blurred at times, which made them unnatural and unrealistic. So to be frank, the selfie expert disappointed me a lot while taking selfies.. That was quick hands-on experience with the newly launched Oppo F5. We will come up with the full review of the device. So stay tuned to GadgetByte Nepal and get subscribed to our YouTube channel .. Is the camera most important feature on a smartphone? Even if your answer is yes, Oppo F5, which happened to be a camera-centric phone struggled with taking good images at times. This is the most implausible and the most intolerable feature with the Oppo F5 and we have most features yet to overlook. So, in my personal opinion, the Oppo F5 does not deserve a price it is tagged with. So, I have short-listed few smartphones with the good cameras and overall performance that comes with a similar price tag and offers a great value for money.. onePlus 3 is the last year’s flagship of the OnePlus, which comes with the vibrant 5.5-inch Optic AMOLED display. The device is powered by a powerful Snapdragon 820 chipset aided by staggering 6GB of RAM.. Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro comes 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display, which outputs punchy colors with natural color tones. The smartphone also excels in the photography with 13MP cameras both on the front and back end with wide apertures and LED flashes to accompany them in the low light scenarios. The phone also enjoys a metal body with water-resistant built.. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro Review: The Flagship Midrange?. Xiaomi MI A1 is the smartphone which comes with dual-cameras at the back and also happens to be an Android One smartphone. Being an Android One smartphone it will enjoy the regular Android updates, which happens to be a privilege for its users. Also, it comes with power-efficient Snapdragon 625 chipset, which is great in terms of performance too.. Huawei Nova 2i is another camera-centric smartphone with dual cameras on the front and on the back. The phone also houses a powerful HiSilicon Kirin 659 chipset aided by 4GB of RAM. This phone also has the narrow bezels and has adopted the trendy 18:9 aspect ratio.. Previous article Apple will release three new iPhones Next Year.
