There's not much of a bezel around the display either, which means the body hasn't had to balloon out too much to accommodate its 5.2-inch display.. That display is bright and bold and while the 720p resolution isn't sharp enough to make details pop, it's fine for reading stories online and chatting with your friends. The fingerprint scanner below the screen works well and doubles as a home button too.. The phone runs Android Nougat, which Nokia has left completely untouched. It results in a clean, fuss-free interface that's easy to use and nippy to navigate thanks to the phone's octa-core processor. The Nokia 5 falls a little below the Moto G5 Plus in benchmark terms, but apps like Gmail load quickly and games like Asphalt: Xtreme are handled well enough for casual mobile gamers.. The 13-megapixel rear camera takes sharp shots, with a good exposure balance. Colours aren't very bold and the white balance can be hit and miss, but for quick snaps for Facebook, it'll suit fine. There's quite a lot of image noise in low-light shots, so wait until you're outside in the daylight to take your best shots. There's an 8-megapixel front camera, too, with an HDR mode that gives sharp, well-balanced selfies.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. 2 GB of RAM and Snapdragon processor aren't the fastest. Photos come out dark, blurry, or over-exposed. The Nokia 5 is a good choice if you care mainly about looks and don't want to spend an arm and a leg. However, if you care about performance, you should probably look elsewhere.. Processor Octa-core 1.4 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 Mobile Platform. MicroSD Yes, up to 128 GB. Cameras Rear: 13 MP sensor with PDAF, 1.12 Î¼m pixels, f/2.0 aperture, dual-tone flash. Front: 8 MP sensor with AF, 1.12 Î¼m pixels, f/2.0 aperture, 84-degree field-of-view. WCDMA: Band 1, 2, 5, 8. LTE: Band 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20, 28, 38, 40. Dimensions and weight 149.7 x 72.5 x 8.05 mm. Colors Tempered Blue, Silver, Matte Black, Copper. For a budget-friendly phone, the Nokia 5 looks and feels rather premium. But for many, itâs what’s on the inside that counts, and thatâs where the phoneâs lower price starts to become evident. The question with any budget phone is what compromises had to be made in order to achieve the price – and whether those compromises are ones you can live with.. Find out if this budget-friendly device is right for you in our full Nokia 5 review!. The Nokia 5 is sleek and doesn't feel 'cheap' at all in the hand.. The Nokia 5 is sleek and doesn’t feel “cheap” at all in the hand. Like many more premium models, itâs made entirely from metal (precision-milled aluminum) and has rounded corners for a very ergonomic feel. Itâs just the right amount of weighty too, giving the impression of quality as a result.. The look is also distinct, with nods to the design language of old Lumia devices. The metal chassis gives it a two-toned finish and a kind of ‘jacket’ that surrounds the front panel. My test unit has a matte chrome finish that looks very nice across the back. The device is also available in black, dark blue, and the in-vogue rose gold.. All in all, the Nokia 5’s aesthetics are not going to win any pageants against the likes of the Galaxy S8 , but itâs definitely a looker.. Speakers are located on the bottom of the device and are pretty loud, though not without occasional distortion when cranked up. Theyâre also located just where you donât want them for gaming. Thereâs a fingerprint sensor on the home button (which is an indent rather than a button) and it’s quite fast. Additionally, the phone is âdripâ resistant with IP52 certification, which means you won’t be able to take it swimming.. The Nokia 5 sports a pretty basic 720p IPS display. If you love crisp white web pages and photos that pop on the screen before you upload them to the PC, you might be disappointed here. Watching media is acceptable but not the best experience for gaming or watching YouTube. If you use your smartphone as a primary media consumption device, then it might be worth looking for something with at least a small bump up in resolution.. This probably isn't the best phone for people that watch a ton of YouTube videos. At 5.2 inches, you theoretically get a lot of screen real estate but this is somewhat neutered by the lower resolution. For instance, when you use Android’s multitasking feature (which does work fine in terms of performance), you won’t be able to resize apps and will be forced to stick at a 50/50 screen share. Likewise, apps feel a little squashed and claustrophobic at anything less than 100%.. The Nokia 5's performance depends heavily on which task you're trying to accomplish. Powering the Nokia 5 is an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor clocked at 1.4 GHz with an Adreno 505 GPU. We’ve seen the Snapdragon 430 perform well in other low-cost handsets, though the Nokia 5’s performance depends heavily on which task you’re trying to accomplish.. For instance, we rarely ran into any issues when multitasking, despite the device’s low 2 GB of RAM. However, we did notice a ton of lag when browsing web pages and gaming, and dropped frames became somewhat normal.. Itâs all perfectly serviceable, itâs just not the most pleasant experience. Whether this is acceptable to you will likely depend on whether browsing and consuming media on your phone is something you do often or particularly enjoy. If not, you may not need this to be the most polished experience.. Call quality, signal strength, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi all work just fine and I experienced no dropped calls or other worrying issues. I will say that YouTube seemed to occasionally downgrade my resolution even on home Wi-Fi, though I’m not sure if this was just a glitch for me or not.. You'll probably want to invest in a microSD card. Whatâs more likely to be a problem for the average user is the tiny amount of internal storage. You get just 16 GB, which will fill up fast if you take a few photos and install a few apps; especially as only half of that will be available when you first boot up the device. Fortunately, there is expandable storage (microSD up to 128 GB) but personally I find that to be a poor substitute and would much rather have both. I’m sure other users would feel similarly.. Battery life here is just fine. The device tends to last me all day, and I even consider myself to be a power user. In one day, I used Google Maps to navigate with the screen on during an hour-long journey, watched several YouTube programs, played Transformers: Forged to Fight ,Â. and had two long calls and it still made it well into the evening.. The device tends to last me all day, and I even consider myself to be a power user. Itâs no workhorse though, and when you consider the 720p display, one might expect better battery performance. It only has a 3,000 mAh battery, so any longevity here is likely coming from the innate software optimization found in Android. Quick Charge 3.0 is a nice addition for a budget phone, which will be able to get you around a 50% charge in an hour.. Additionally, the decision to go with a MicroUSB port over USB Type-C does feel pretty backwards, and means you can expect slower transfer speeds than other Android devices out there.. Another area where corners seem to have been cut is the camera.. There was a time when cameras were Nokiaâs âthingâ, but youâll be disappointed if you were expecting anything exciting here. There was a time when cameras were Nokiaâs âthingâ (Lumia 1020 anyone?), but youâll be disappointed if you were expecting anything exciting here. The megapixel count is respectable at 13 MP, but the main problem here is lighting. Most photos come out too dark, even in good lighting conditions. There is a hefty flash on the back, though it mostly leaves things with brilliant white spots and long shadows.. Daylight shots look fairly washed out most of the time, and other times theyâll appear overexposed or blurred â especially when shooting moving subjects. HDR is present and the autofocus works well enough, so you can get some nice shots with a little work and patience. Just know that youâll want to take another camera with you on holiday and that your Facebook albums arenât going to be the most dynamic among your friends.. Camera software is disappointingly basic too, with no fun or unique features to explore. For example, you won’t find any fun filters to play with, nor will you have the option to change settings manually. It really does feel rather stripped back.. The 8 MP front-facing camera is capable of recording video in 1080p. This ironically means you canât play them back at full resolution until you get them home and onto the computer!. The Nokia 5’s software experience is something that will make many of our readers happy though, and that’s because it’s basically running stock Android. With no bloatware or crazy customizations, things run as quickly as possible.. It’s also running one of the latest versions of Android, 7.1.1 Nougat , which means you’ll get access to the latest features from Google, such asÂ. As long as the device is on or plugged in, you can summon Google at any time to offer you conversions in the kitchen, or to start navigation while driving. Thatâs a pretty great feature in such an affordable device.. With no bloatware or crazy customizations, things run as quickly as possible.. While a lot of people love the bare-bones Android experience, it’s not going to be perfect for every user. For instance, to do something simple like displaying the battery percentage in your status bar, you need to navigate to the well-hidden System UI Tuner to do so. It’d also be nice to have a tethering shortcut in the quick settings panel. Things like this demonstrate that customizations arenât always a bad thing â and you may actually miss some of them when theyâre gone. Many people wonât notice these things are missing though, and there are apps to handle most of it. As it is, stock Android can sometimes feel a little empty.. I always find it tricky to review budget devices like this. When you spend this little –Â. you know that youâre not likely to get the very best design, specs, and camera. Instead you need to choose which of these things matters most to you and where you want the limited budget to go. The Nokia 5 is for those people to whom looks matter more than specs and performance. If you want a phone that will serve as a bit more of a fashion statement and look good when you use it, then this might be a solid choice.. If you want a phone that will serve as a bit more of a fashion statement and look good good when you use it, then this might be a solid choice.. But if youâre someone who loves mobile gaming and consuming media, then something with a better screen and a little more oomph may be your preference. Either way, youâll want to invest in a microSD card and youâll probably still need to bring a camera with you when you travel.. Like the Nokia 5’s look but want a little more screen resolution and maybe some stereo speakers? Then check out the Nokia 6. HMD Global , Nokia , nokia 5. Your source for all things Android!.

Battery life struggles when pushed, and load times can be lengthy.. Photos can be a little dark. Storage fills up fast, microSD card a must. The Essential Review Who’s it for and should I buy it? Nokia 5 price and availability Launch price (Aug 2017): £179.99 (around $200, AU$275), R13,499 Available in UK from August 16, India from August 15 - 3GB variant in November The best-looking phone in its price bracket Premium all-metal body oozes style HD display is clear, but lacks color pop Fingerprint scanner is nice addition at the budget end of the market Battery life A day of battery life from a single charge if you’re lucky Video and gaming really take their toll Charging is slow Camera Slow to load and focus Images can be muddy and lacking in color It suffices for the odd social post Anything else I should know?

Try these: Read our hands on Nokia 6 review Read our in-depth Moto G5 review Read our in-depth Honor 6X Want more options? Check out our best cheap phones rundown. This is TechRadar’s review summary that gives you all the key information you need if you’re looking for quick buying advice in 30 seconds - our usual full, in-depth review follows.. The Nokia 5 sits a little awkwardly, between the better-equipped Nokia 6 and eye-catchingly cheap Nokia 3 .. It’s not that it’s a bad phone, but its bigger brother doesn't cost that much more, so it would be easy to chuck in a little extra cash for the 6 – or, if you’re really looking to save the pennies, you might be better off with the 3.. Don't discount it just yet though. The Nokia 5 is the best looking smartphone in its price bracket, with its all-metal body providing a premium finish that could easily be seen a more expensive device.. The 5.2-inch HD (720p) display is crisp and clear, although the colors don’t exactly jump out of the screen, while the inclusion of a fingerprint scanner on the front of the handset is a big plus adding an extra layer of security and an easy way to unlock the phone.. We’d have liked to have seen a stronger showing from the battery, with considered usage gaining you a day of use from a single charge, but gaming, video playback or music streaming will see you running out of juice by early evening.. The 13MP rear camera looks great on paper, but in practice images tend to look dull and lack clarity – while the camera app itself is sluggish. The slow performance extends to the whole device though, and you’ll need to be patient to be able to live with the Nokia 5’s load times.. The Nokia 5 is aimed at anyone looking for an affordable smartphone from a brand they trust – and few manufacturers can boast the history and appeal to nostalgia that the Nokia name carries.. It's especially attractive to those with a keen eye for style, but without pockets deep enough for a flagship, or even sub-flagship, device. Just because you’re paying less doesn’t always mean you have to compromise on design.. You won’t find a more premium finish on a smartphone that costs this little, and as long as you’re willing to be patient, and are less into gaming and movies and more into emails and social apps, then you’ll certainly enjoy the Nokia 5.. The Nokia 5 has been on sale since August, landing for £180 in the UK with 2GB of RAM. However, in November 2017 a 3GB variant has been launched in India, for the price of R13,499 to give it a little extra power and more choice for those that want more from their Nokia 5.. The compact form factor of the Nokia 5 is something which may sway prospective buyers towards it, and away from the bigger Nokia 6.. It’s a more ergonomic design, with the curved edges nestling comfortably into the palm, and you can reach anywhere on screen with your thumb.. Screen size : 5.2inch Resolution : 720x1280 Battery : 3000mAh Front camera : 8MP Rear camera : 13MP Weight : 160g Dimensions (mm) : 149.7 x 72.5 x 8 OS : Android 7 CPU : Snapdragon 430 RAM : 2GB (3GB variant in India) Storage : 16GB + microSD. Crafted from a single block of 6000-series aluminum, the Nokia 5 has a surprisingly premium construction for a phone with such a low price tag. It feels like a more expensive phone when you pick it up, and that’s great.. Another bonus of the Nokia 5 is the presence of a fingerprint scanner below the screen, which also doubles as the home navigation key. Digit readers tend to be reserved for pricier devices, so it’s good to see the tech filtering down the tiers, and especially to a device as cheap as the Nokia 5.. You can pick the Nokia 5 up in four different colors: copper, black, silver and blue.. The 720p HD display is bright and clear, giving a good level of detail to images and text alike. You can comfortably read emails, watch videos and enjoy gaming sessions on the 1280 x 720 screen.. It’s not overly vibrant when it comes to color reproduction, and if you put this LCD panel next to an AMOLED screen you’ll notice it’s duller to the eye. In isolation though, and considering the price you’re paying, it’s hard to knock the screen on the Nokia 5 too much.. The Nokia 5 comes with a 3,000mAh battery, which if you’re someone who doesn’t tend to game or watch video on their phone should last you a full day on a single charge.. You’re highly unlikely to get more than a day from the Nokia 5 though, with a nightly plug-in required to see you through the next day.. And if you like to use your phone for streaming music and gaming, the Nokia 5 will require a top-up come mid to late afternoon if you want it to last until bedtime.. With an average daily usage of a couple of hours of Spotify streaming, around an hour of gaming, social networking, emails, messaging and a few calls we usually found ourselves plugging in before we left work to ensure the Nokia 5 lasted the commute home and the evening.. We ran our 90-minute HD video battery test on the Nokia 5, with Wi-Fi connected and screen brightness on full, and the handset lost a huge 37% of its juice.. While you’re unlikely to watch a movie at full brightness on this phone it’s a good indication of how quickly the Nokia 5 can drain when it’s pushed; by comparison the Moto G5 lost 22% in the same test.. The phone is charged via a micro USB port on the base of the handset, but there’s no fast charging here. It means the Nokia 5 takes a while to top up, so if you’re going out for the night you’ll want to put it on charge at least an hour before heading out the door to make sure you get a decent slug of juice.. The Nokia 5 has cameras, sure – two of them to be exact. But you’re unlikely to be winning any photography competitions thanks to them.. Round the back the main 13MP camera sounds promising on paper, but in practice it’s sluggish, and doesn’t always produce good pictures.. Even with HDR (High Dynamic Range) mode enabled we still found images could look a little dark, and a lack of detail and color was a common theme throughout our shooting experience.. If you’re patient, letting the app load up and the focus settle, you can get some decent shots if the lighting is good, and we found the Nokia 5 performed pretty well up close – but it’s far from a fluid shooting experience.. There’s no manual or pro mode to give you control over settings such as shutter speed and white balance, but at this end of the smartphone market that’s no surprise.. The app itself is simple to work out. There’s a large centralized shutter key, while quick settings at the top of the screen enable you to switch between the front and rear cameras and toggle the flash, timer and HDR settings.. You can also use the volume key to snap shots, which is sometimes much easier than hitting the on-screen button, especially when it comes to selfies.. The 8MP selfie camera on the front is good enough for the odd Snapchat and Instagram post, plus there’s a beauty mode built in if you’re not looking your best.. Even with HDR, areas in shadow can be darker than expected. Again, the sign here is darker than we'd like, even though that's where the focus is. Low light shooting is okay, but images can look muddy and lack detail. There's a basic brightness control on the Nokia 5, tweaking it can produce nice shots. Indoor shooting is also okay, but images tend to lack clarity. Colors can look a little muted in images from the Nokia 5. The Nokia 5 can struggle to pick out fine detail, such as the hair on this cat. Take your time and frame your shot with good light, and the Nokia 5 can take good photos. Up close the Nokia 5 performs well, with good detail on this figure. The Nokia 5 isn’t going to blow you away with slick performance, and that’s no surprise considering the price tag, but what it does offer is a pure Android experience.. It runs the latest version of Google’s software – Android 7.1.1 Nougat – which means it’s bang up to date, and with no heavy interface overlaid by HMD, owners of this phone shouldn’t have to wait too long for an update to Android Oreo when it launches later this year.. In fact, the latest version of Android is being offered as a beta test already, so it won't be long before you can get your hands on an updated version of the software for everyone.. The standard suite of Google applications are preinstalled, and that’s it. There’s no additional bloatware, so you have a clean canvas on which to install the apps and games you want, without ones you don’t want getting in the way.. Under the hood the Nokia 5 comes with a Snapdragon 430 chipset and 2GB of RAM, pretty much the expected setup at this price point. In terms of the performance this delivers… well, you’ll need to be patient.. Load times are noticeable, but during our review time with the Nokia 5 we didn’t find an app or game it couldn’t run. Sure, it’s not got the zip of a flagship device, but it’s a quarter of the price and it’s far from unusable.. We ran the Geekbench 4 app on the phone, and it turned in an average multicore score of 2,765. That puts it in the mix with the equally priced Moto G5 (2,377), Honor 6X (3,275) and Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus (2,073).. What this means day-to-day is that the Nokia 5 is perfectly capable when it comes to web browsing, messaging, social media and emails; and although you’ll need to be patient if you’re firing up more intensive apps or games, as this is a phone that goes at its own pace, it will still run them at a playable level.. The fingerprint sensor below the display is generally responsive, but there is a slight delay as it detects your digit and wakes the phone, and there were a few times when we had to present our finger more than once before it was recognized and the handset unlocked.. It’s good to see the biometric tech included in a low-cost handset though, and another nice addition on the Nokia 5 is Google Assistant, giving you a useful AI that can answer your questions, organize your day and update you on your commute. To launch it you press and hold on the fingerprint scanner/home key.. There is one big factor about the Nokia we need to address; the issue of storage on the handset.. There’s 16GB of space inside the phone, but 7.5GB of that is taken up by the Android system straight out of the box – leaving you with effectively half the space to actually use for your apps, games, videos, music and photos.. We had filled up this storage within two days of getting the Nokia 5, with a few large applications including Micro Machines, Spotify, Facebook and Pokemon Go all taking up a fair whack of space.. Thankfully the Nokia 5 does come with a microSD slot, a second tray on the left of the handset below the one for your nanoSIM. The phone can also ‘adopt’ the card storage, meaning it sees it as part of the internal storage of the handset, rather than an external resource, which makes saving data to the card easier and quicker.. In short, if you buy the Nokia 5 make sure you invest in a microSD card of at least 8GB.. The single speaker on the base of the Nokia 5 doesn’t produce particularly great audio, with a lack of bass and tinny sound meaning you’ll only want to use it for gaming or watching the odd video.. Its placement also means it’s easily covered by your hand when you hold the phone in landscape orientation, giving you even more reason to grab a pair of headphones and plug them into the 3.5mm jack at the top of the Nokia 5.. Video playback is passable, and you can comfortably watch YouTube videos and TV shows on the Nokia 5. You won’t want to watch a movie on the phone, though, as the smaller screen size and slightly muted colors won’t do them justice, and those who like full HD or higher resolution will be out of luck here.. You can also game on the Nokia 5, but again patience is required. Demanding games such as Micro Machines and Pokemon Go are playable, but load times can be lengthy.. Even more simple games, such as New Star Soccer and New Star Cricket, take a little time to load, but once you’re up and running the performance of the Nokia 5 doesn’t hamper gameplay – we didn’t feel like the Nokia 5 was ever negatively impacting our performance in online races in Micro Machines, for example.. The phone does get rather warm during extended periods of gameplay, and if you’re playing consistently for over an hour games can crash on the Nokia 5.. If the Nokia 5 isn’t for you, then we’ve picked three excellent choices for you to consider instead.. If your budget can stretch just a little, it's worth looking at the Nokia 6. It boasts a larger, full HD 5.5-inch display and more RAM under the hood for slicker performance.. It also comes with the same premium, all metal body as the Nokia 5, making it feel more expensive than it actually is.. Motorola's G series has been the gold standard for cheap smartphones for a few years now, and 2017's Moto G5 is no different packing a tidy selection of specs into a compact package.. The design isn't as premium as the Nokia 5, but overall performance and camera quality is superior here.. The Honor 6X is another handset that offers a larger, higher resolution display than the Nokia 5 (5.5-inch full HD) - although you will have to pay a little more for the privilege.. With an impressive power, a solid build and simple to use software the 6X is a good choice if you don’t want to spend much money..

The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Scenes.

The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 1400 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz.

Unboxing, 360-degree spin, hardware overview 3. Nokia 5 specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (90). Nokia Android Dual SIM. From left to right: Nokia 6  Nokia 5  Nokia 3. Body: Aluminum body, 2.5D Gorilla Glass display glass (unspecified version). Tempered Blue, Silver, Matte Black, Copper color schemes. Display: 5.2" IPS LCD 1,280x720px resolution, 282ppi. Rear camera: 13MP, 1.12µm pixel size, f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus, dual LED, dual tone flash; 1080p/30fps video recording. Front camera: 8MP 1.12µm pixel size, f/2.0 aperture, autofocus; 1080p/30fps video recording. Chipsets: Qualcomm Snapdragon 430: octa-core 1.4GHz Cortex-A53 CPU, Adreno 505 GPU. Memory: 2GB of RAM; 16GB of storage, dedicated microSD slot for expansion. Connectivity: Dual SIM version available (ours is single SIM); Cat.4 LTE (150/50Mbps); microUSB 2.0; Wi-Fi a/b/g/n; GPS; Bluetooth 4.1; FM Radio; NFC. Misc: Front-mounted fingerprint reader; single speaker on the bottom; 3.5mm jack. Low amount of RAM by today's standards; 16GB of storage is especially crippling. Part of the original trio announced in the spring to mark Nokia return to making phones, the Nokia 5 occupies the middle ground between the basic 3 and the slightly fancier 6. We've been arguing on what's the right way to break ties when rounding numbers (you know, the usual office quarrels) and Nokia's gone with the controversial 'round half up' .. You see, the Nokia 5 has the 3's display resolution on a slightly larger diagonal, but not as large as the 6. An aluminum unibody, not unlike the 6's, has been chosen instead of the 3's aluminum frame/plastic back combo, and while the entry-level 3 didn't get a fingerprint reader, there is one gracing the 5's face.. Inside the Nokia 5 you'll find the 6's more powerful chipset, but the 3's scant 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. The 5 matches the 6's battery capacity at 3,000mAh, but is denied the stereo speakers and it's a single bottom-firing unit this time - like the one on the Nokia 3.. But even those that insist on rounding to even have to agree that the 13MP rear camera makes a solid case for the Nokia 5 being a 5 and not a 4 - an 8MP camera on the Nokia 3, 16MP on the Nokia 6, and 13MP makes for a Nokia 4.875, so 5 then, alright, we concede.. The point we're trying to make with this math gibberish is that the new Nokia is doing a good job of segmenting its products, and is offering something to cater to varied target audiences. Maybe a Nokia 4 would be too much - let's not go there.. We have to praise Nokia for opting for a dedicated microSD slot that lets you have a memory card and two SIM cards in the phone at the same time - that is, if you get the dual SIM version of the Nokia 5, which our review unit isn't. But a microSD slot doesn't really make up for the 16GB of storage - we'd have been happier with 32GB.. Less of an issue, but still worth whining about is Nokia decision to go with a microUSB 2.0 port instead of the USB-C of the present and future. Sure, you probably still have a bunch of those microUSB cables lying around, but we do have to move forward eventually, right? Major phone makers should spearhead the change or we'll be left with two competing standards for quite a while.. Moving forward one step at a time with this review, we'll continue with the Nokia 5's unboxing and hardware overview on the next page.. Unboxing, 360-degree spin, hardware overview 3.

Good for the price but has prolems with GPS. The camera is very slow and bad in low light and very slow to focus, im used to much better quilty from a google pixel so its unfair to compare apples to oranges but this is my experience. I didnt expect a good camera for the price, but i thing the rating on this site clearly take into account overall value, if your on a budget.. The GPS doesnt work first time 9/10 times this is the case on mulitple GPS application, after resets etc. The only solution ive found is to stop navigation and start again and its kicks in instants after a few attempts. This is very fustraing is you use GPS frequently.. Battery life is fantastic! This is due to the size of the battery and the low powered processor.. Odd slowdowns when tried to multitask probs due to the 2Gb of RAM.. Nokia have promised an Oreo update before chrimstmas 2017, which i was hoping may fixed GPS issue, but this has yet to happen and staff/support can provide no update on the matter.. I really dont like the finger print sensor location. Due to the size of the phone i find myself having to shimy down the phone to reach it and over time this may contribute to RSI due to the strain, i do have small hand not big dad hands ;). If your not spoilt like me with previously using a Google Pixel then im sure you wont notice these things.. Rated 4 out of. I just recently bought this Nokia 5 from Carphone Warehouse to replace a Nokia 3 that I'd only had a couple of months as this Nokia 5 was on offer at the same price the Nokia 3 I bought the other month. This is actually the phone I had intended to buy do i bought the silver version a couple days before Christmas. My choice being it's snapdragon based chipset and the body is a beauty! And I only paid £100! Brilliant! It's been great so far for Netflix and Prime; also Spotify & gaming! And no signs of the Nokia 3's lagging when on "heavy" apps! All in all I am very pleased! FanQ. Rated 3 out of. Had this phone 5 months now. Great looking, near stock android, reasonably priced. Now the bad, it's glitchy, mostly non specific but I cant track my steps and navigation often doesn't work and despite adding a SD card as internal memory it refuses to save to it and keeps stopping activities due to low memory.. Rated 5 out of. Bought this about a week ago. Battery life is great performance is fantastic only noticed a little stutter at £100 tho you cant moa.

You’d be forgiven for wondering who HMD Global is, but the company has made a huge splash this year by launching four phones with the Nokia brand: the wonderfully nostalgic Nokia 3310 as well as three budget and mid-range Android phones with excellent price tags.. These phones represent the first Nokia phones to ever run Android, which is why it caused so much excitement. They’re called the Nokia 3 , Nokia 5 and Nokia 6. Here, we review the Nokia 5, which sits in the middle of the range when it comes to size, specs and price.. Since the Nokia 5 was unveiled, the Nokia 8 has also been released, sitting at the top end of the range with a higher price tag and better specs. And a new Nokia 9 is rumoured to be on its way. Find out more about the Nokia 8 here and Nokia 9 here .. On 6 November a version of the Nokia 5 with 3GB of RAM is being unveiled in India. We do not yet know whether this version will become available in the UK. It's an exclusive to FlipKart until 13 November.. The Nokia 5 is available now from Nokia, networks and resellers, after hitting the shelves in August.. It is priced at a surprising £179, which is a brilliant price for a. budget phone and sits it firmly alongside the Moto G5 , which is priced at £169. Another worthy rival is the Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus , which is also high in our budget phones chart and is priced at £189.. If you’re after the copper colour option of the Nokia 5 and you’re in the UK you’ll need to buy from Carphone Warehouse , which has the exclusive on that model.. We love the design of the Nokia 5. We were so pleasantly surprised when we first picked it up, already knowing how low the price tag is. It has a 5.2in display within a neat, compact body. It feels incredibly premium, with smooth, rounded edges that make it sleek and comfortable to hold.. It’s made from a single block of 6000 series aluminium, and uses Gorilla Glass to add durability to the display. It weighs 160g and measures just 8mm in thickness.. The bezels on either side of the screen are tiny, and seem to blend right into the chassis. The 5.2in display means the overall size of the phone is good for one-handed use and portability while still offering enough room for a good experience when watching videos or playing games.. The Nokia 5 is available in Matte Black, Silver, Tempered Blue or Copper. We particularly like the blue option, but all four colours look gorgeous. Show this phone to a friend and they’ll never guess the price tag. While we love the size of the screen, a downfall is that its display resolution isn’t as high as we’d have liked.. It’s 1280 x 720 HD at 282ppi, which still manages to be vivid and bright, but when compared with the likes of the Moto G5’s Full HD offering on a phone with the slightly lower. price tag it’s a bit of a shame that the Nokia 5 misses out.. Inside the Nokia 5 is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor, which is the same processor you’ll find inside the Nokia 6 and the Moto G5. That’s paired with Adreno 505 graphics and 2GB RAM.. The Nokia 5 managed to achieve a significantly better score than the Moto G5 in our Geekbench 4 processor tests, although it couldn’t quite live up to the Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus in every test.. In practice, we found the Nokia 5 plenty fast enough for day-to-day tasks such as sending messages, checking emails and browsing the web. Apps open without much lag, including the camera app, and the only time we found it a little too slow is when we needed to use the flash.. It also achieved much higher scores than the Moto G5 in all of our GFX Bench tests, which are designed to test the graphics capabilities.. There’s 16GB of internal memory with support for up to 128GB of additional storage via MicroSD.. There’s a non-removable 3000mAh battery that charges via MicroUSB, which we found could last for a full day on one charge with reasonably heavy use, and two days or more with light use, which we were suitably satisfied by.. Again, this beats the Moto G5’s 2800mAh battery, although the Nokia 5 misses out on the rapid charging capabilities. a few hours of battery life after just 15 minutes of charging.. Connectivity includes Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and LTE 4G, and there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top for your wired headphones.. A fingerprint sensor is built into the home button, and we found it to be easy to setup and almost always quick and responsive.. When it comes to cameras, the Nokia 5 has a 13Mp camera on the rear with a dual tone flash. Photos are captured in 4:3 aspect ratio, and if you want to capture 16:9 you’ll reduce the quality to 8Mp.. This is in line with rivals like the Moto G5, and we found that it could capture satisfactory photos in most lighting, perfect for on-the go shots to look back on or to share on social media.. You can see examples of the photographs we captured with the Nokia 5’s rear camera below.. The front-facing camera offers 8Mp for selfies, which is better than the Moto G5’s 5Mp offering.. Low light photos aren't great, but the flash makes up for this as you'll see from the photos above.. The Nokia 5 is among the first Nokia phones to run the Android operating system. It comes with Android 7.1.1, and fans of stock Android will be pleased to hear that Nokia has left it well alone.. This is one of the cheapest ways to get stock Android outside of the Pixel series made by Google itself so a big thumbs up from us. That means an intuative interface and no additional bloatware.. The Nokia 5 also offers Google Assistant, which is the Android AI assistant in the same way that Siri is Apple’s iOS voice assistant. You can read about Google Assistant here .. We’ve long been lovers of the Moto G series for the top pick in the budget Android category,. the Nokia 5 nearly knocks it off the top spot. performance and a stunning design, we are blown away by the low price tag offered here.. A downside is the screen resolution, but if you can look past this and you’re looking for an Android smartphone that costs less than £200, you can’t get much better than this..

Newly manufactured by HMD Global, modern Nokia smartphones will have a clean, simplified design language alongside stock Android software.. The Nokia 5 exemplifies this ideal, being manufactured from a piece of aluminium, with sculpted 2.5D curved glass. Pure Android 7.1.1 is installed out of the box and the phone will receive regular security updates and patches.. The Nokia 5 from Clove Technology will be provided SIM Free and ready to work on all compatible UK and European networks.. The phone uses a NANO SIM card. For LTE compatibility outside of Europe, please check the specifications with your local operator.. The Nokia 5 is being manufactured in Matte Black, Silver, Copper and Tempered Blue with 2GB of RAM and 16GB Storage.. Availability of all options will depend on global sales region.. Many of us will have owned a Nokia feature phone and may look back with fondness at handsets which were simple communicators.. With their 2017 smartphones, Nokia is looking to recapture that essence.. At a first glance, the Nokia 5 is a very simple smartphone, which was Nokia's intention. Look a little closer and you will see that philosophy of simplicity everywhere.. This includes the software, which is bare bones Android 7.1.1 out of the box. Without any modifications, you are free to use your Nokia 5 as you see fit.. Large screens are in fashion but aren't for everybody. Nokia acknowledges this and has fitted the mid-range Nokia 5 with an ample but not overwhelming 5.2" display.. Thanks to the slimline aluminium casing and narrow bezels, this size display is housed without creating a thick or heavy handset. The brushed aluminium chassis is lightweight and durable, able to withstand regular use.. The screen glass has been carefully constructed with curved 2.5D Gorilla Glass. This is sculpted specifically for the Nokia 5 dimensions, rather than simply cut to shape - an extra step in the manufacturing process that illustrates how much Nokia care.. Nokia has also moved the antenna lines to the corners of the phone where they are less likely to be obstructed. This placement also creates a seamless back panel without any distracting lines.. Affordable phones often stumble with their cameras; not so with the Nokia 5.. The main camera has a respectable 13-megapixel sensor with f/2.0 lens aperture and 1.12-micron pixels. Automatic scene detection and phase detection auto focus allow you to make the best out of any scene, indoors or out.. Several manual options also exist including HDR and panoramas for capturing beautiful landscapes.. An 8 MP sensor is located on the front of the phone for high-resolution selfies and video calls. This has a high 84-degree field of view for getting everyone in on a group shot.. Nokia is ensuring that the latest Android is available for the Nokia 6. Shipping with version 7.1.1, the system will be stock without any additional software or apps outside of Google's recommended suite.. Nokia has also stated they will provide regular updates which will keep you safe and secure.. Stock Android 7.0 has a number of new features, the full list can be found HERE .. A total of 1500 emoji is now available in Android 7 with several new icons being provided through updates.. Nougat also allows you to have more than one standard language saved to the keyboard. This lets you quickly switch between languages and dictionaries from the keyboard, without having to go deep into the settings.. Running two apps side by side is now built directly into Android. This is also useful for switching between apps. For instance, you could have YouTube running in one window whilst browsing through a relevant news article.. Google has updated the Vulkan API within Android 7 so developers can take advantage of new 3D techniques when creating games and other interactive experiences.. Virtual Reality is now built directly into Android 7 thanks to Android Daydream .. Pick up a Daydream ready headset and download VR content from the Play store to experience a new dimension of entertainment.. Android's Doze system will intelligently put background applications into a low power mode. Apps that require background processes will be left to operate normally, so you don't have to worry about closing down all your apps to improve performance.. Doze has also been updated with Android 7. If the screen is off and the phone notices movement such as you walking with it in your pocket, it will automatically switch to a low-power mode until lifted.. Notifications have been overhauled in Android 7. Groups of notifications from a single app (such as multiple conversations from a messaging app) are bundled into one icon. This can be tapped on and expanded for more detail.. You can also act directly from the notification shade. If you only need to make a quick reply, you can type directly into a mini conversation on the notification shade rather than having to fully open the relevant app.. The quick settings menu can also be rearranged to better suit your personal use of the phone.. New Android features include seamless updates. System updates will download in the background in a separate partition and are checked prior to installation. Background download lets you choose when to make the final installation, rather than being interrupted.. Find out more about Android security HERE .. Resolution 720 x 1280 (~282 ppi).

Nokia 5 Specifications Review, Features and Price In India. The Nokia 5 is a budget smartphone from the company which is trying to get back to its position of a top player in the smartphone market. Unveiled alongside three other phones at this year's MWC, the phone can be termed as a toned down version of the much in vogue Nokia 6. The Nokia 5 features a 5.2-inch HD display protected by a 2.5D sculpted Corning Gorilla Glass on the top and will boots the latest Android 7.1.1 Nougat OS out of the box. Along with that, the phone features the same processor as the Nokia 6 (Snapdragon 430), coupled with a 2GB RAM. On the optics front, phone features a 13MP camera on the back with features including PDAF, dual-tone flash and f/2.0 aperture, along with a 5MP one on the front that offers pretty much the same features, except for an additional 84-degree field of view. Along with that, the phone packs a 3,000mAh battery and features an in-built storage space of 16GB, which can be turned into a maximum of 128GB upon using a microSD card. Primarily being a budget phone, the Nokia 5 best price in India is expected to be around 13,299INR. You can subscribe to Smartprix to get notifications and alerts regarding the upcoming Nokia 5.. The Nokia 5 is very bright at its maximum setting, and you can get all 630-something nits manually, the automatic setting doesn't offer a boost on top of that but it's not really necessary. The Nokia 5 comes in singe and dual SIM versions, and the one we have on our hands is the single SIM one. The Nokia 5 is equipped with a 13MP primary camera that sits behind an f/2.0 aperture lens. The Nokia 5 produces surprising good panoramas for its class.. Low amount of RAM by today's standards No USB-C port No quick charge support. The Nokia 5 is a pretty smartphone that comes with a clean and up-to-date software but ultimately disappoints in terms of performance. Your alternatives: the Moto G5 can currently provide a similar package while also boasting a Full HD display, although its battery life is a bit inferior. Another handset that comes to mind is the Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017). It's a bit more expensive than the Nokia 5, but it has water and dust protection and superior cameras, while also lasting longer between charges.. Great design and build quality Good battery life Android software is clean and up-to-date Reliable fingerprint scanner Decent video recording. Performance is underwhelming, slow to load Hit and miss photo quality Limited internal storage. With a neat design, a low price and power enough for the essentials, the Nokia 5 is budget Android done well.. Nokia 5 is affordable Looks good and has a battery that won't quit on you before the day's done. It's only powerful enough for the essentials Camera doesn't take brilliant shots.

Nokia 6 first look: Latest Android software and security, sub-$200 price, excellent fit and finish Back in 2013, many wished Nokia had gone with Android to survive without the Microsoft takeover. Nokia-branded smartphones are back and the Nokia 6 gives us a glimpse of the greatness to come from HMD Global. Nokia 8: HMD Global's flagship smartphone is aimed at content creators With a new partnership with Zeiss optics, HMD Global brings a unique dual-camera experience with advanced audio recording capability that is designed to capture the world around you.. Nokia's return to the handset scene is now well and truly underway. The comeback started with the retro Nokia 3310 , and continued with the Nokia 3 , 5 and 6. The most recent development is the announcement of the flagship Nokia 8 .. All except the Nokia 3310 are Android handsets, rising in price and capability in accordance with their model number. The 5.2-inch Nokia 5 's key competitor is the five-inch Moto G5 , although there are plenty of other affordable options, including (in the UK) the Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus .. Nokia's partner HMD Global is behind the new handset range, and has given a lot of attention to the build of the Nokia 5 and its stablemates.. The 5.2-inch Nokia 5 is based on a Snapdragon 430 chipset with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal (MicroSD-expandable) storage. It comes in Silver, Matte Black, Tempered Blue and Copper, and weighs 160g.. The unibody aluminium back and sides ooze quality -- the metal is tough, and I couldn't bend this phone at all in my hands. My silver review unit was really great to look at; the black matte version is a little more humdrum, while the copper and tempered blue variants are both attractive.. The back is cool to the touch and isn't slippy in the hand. Its curve into the phone's edges, which then continue to curve into the front face, feel very comfortable to hold. The antenna band sits on the top edge of the handset, blending nicely into the overall design. It's mirrored on the bottom edge, making a nice design symmetry.. The raised lozenge on the back housing the camera lens and flash looks attractive in a minimalist way. The Nokia 5 measures 72.5mm wide by 149.7mm deep by 8.05mm thick, although that raised lozenge increases the thickness to 8.55mm at that point. The handset weighs a perfectly acceptable 160g.. The screen isn't quite bezel-free on its long edges: there's a 2mm strip of Gorilla Glass between the screen and the handset's edges. The top and bottom bezels are 15mm and 17mm respectively: if Nokia is aiming for a truly stylish mid-range design these larger bezels need to slim down.. The lower bezel is home to a fingerprint sensor, which was easy to set up and responsive in use -- although the pad is a little small. This is something Motorola has also squeezed into the £180 Moto G5, and so to have omitted it would have been a serious error.. However, Nokia's implementation is less sophisticated than on the Moto G5, which allows the fingerprint sensor to execute a range of navigation functions via sweeps and taps.. Motorola's handset supports these additional gestures via software add-ons. However, Nokia has stuck with pure unadulterated Android 7.1.1, which means no fancy additions. It also means no bloatware, filling the internal storage with potentially superfluous offerings.. For those who like to stay bang up to date with Android, the pure installation has another advantage: Nokia states quite clearly at its website that it will provide regular updates.. Even without an Android UI overlay or any bloatware, the Nokia 5's moderate 16GB of internal storage is considerably reduced right out of the box, with 7.49GB already consumed. Fortunately there's a MicroSD card slot for external storage expansion.. The Nokia 5 only offers 720p resolution (282ppi), and has sizeable top and bottom screen bezels, the latter housing a fingerprint reader.. The 5.2-inch IPS LCD screen has a resolution of 1,280 by 720 pixels -- lower than the five-inch Moto G5, which has a full-HD (1,920x1,080) screen. That translates to 441 pixels per inch (ppi) for the Moto G5 compared to 282ppi for the Nokia 5.. I wasn't able to compare the two handsets side by side, but didn't find the Moto G5 screen to be particularly special when I reviewed that phone. The same can be said here: the Nokia 5's display isn't fabulous, nor is it awful. The single speaker on the bottom edge of the handset is another matter. Audio quality is tinny, and distorts at higher volumes.. There's a 13-megapixel main camera and an eight-megapixel front camera, with a few bells and whistles such as a 'spirit level' and grid to help with framing pictures and the ability to add a text 'watermark' to photos. A double press of the power button acts as a camera quick launch.. Camera features and shooting modes are pretty sparse though -- you can't even adjust things like white balance or shutter speed. For the most part images were decent enough, but if you're looking for sophistication in your smartphone camera, you should probably look elsewhere.. The octa-core Snapdragon 430 chipset and 2GB of RAM do an adequate job, but the Nokia 5 is far from a speedy performer -- there's a definite wait between tapping an app's icon and it being fully loaded and ready to use, for example. That said, if you confine yourself to mainstream tasks and don't expect flagship-level performance, you shouldn't be disappointed.. Nokia doesn't give an estimate of how long the handset's 3,000mAh battery will last, but my experience during testing suggests that you might struggle to get through a full day without recharging -- although, as ever, battery life will depend on the screen brightness setting and the workloads you throw at the device. There's no fast-charge option, but Nokia has opted for a Micro-USB connector so a standard charge cable will work just fine with the Nokia 5.. To help meet its price target, Nokia has prioritised hardware design and robustness over processor speed and storage space, and also opted for a simple camera setup and a moderate-resolution screen. The inclusion of a fingerprint scanner is welcome the face of such compromises.. Performance isn't anything special either, although you'll notice the lack of speed more if you're used to toting a flagship handset with the latest chipset. What's more noticeable is the absence of software bloat and a regularly-updated vanilla Android implementation. VAT) Nokia has delivered a reasonably competitive mid-range handset, although we do have a slight concern over battery life.. Kick off your day with ZDNet's daily email newsletter.

more ... more .... more ... more .... Display The scientific display measurements allow us to inspect the quality of this extremely important component in such a great depth that is not possible with the naked eye. Armed with a colorimeter device and some specialized software, we study the various aspects of smartphone and tablet screens, such as their brightness, color temperature, gamma, color gamut and accuracy. Screen measurements Our ‘Screen measurements’ table is like a quick, yet very detailed overview of a display. With just a quick glance, you can discover a great deal of important data, including the maximum brightness, contrast ratio, gamma, color temperature, etc. Hover over each category to learn more about it and what makes it important!. Color charts Sometimes, it’s easier to get an idea of how good a display is by comparing its measured colors to reference ones. The ‘Color accuracy’ and ‘Greyscale accuracy’ charts will give you just that, with the latter providing a visual representation of the color temperature and gamma. The ‘Color gamut’ chart, on the other hand, will show you just how much of a deviation there is from the colors’ reference points. Performance Benchmarks If there’s one thing smartphone consumers value extremely highly, that’s lightning-fast system performance. But how do you tell if a device has the necessary power to carry you through the seas of demanding apps and beyond? The answer is simple - through synthetic benchmarking! Thankfully, there are now tools that are professional enough to give us a good idea about the punch our devices really pack. Camera Speed A good camera is the one that’s always there when you need it. Quality matters, but so does speed, and that is why we do a series of tests to determine if a smartphone’s camera has what it takes to be a reliable tool in your photographic activities. We measure camera speed by running the cross-platform benchmark program CamSpeed, and by performing our own proprietary speed test. Audio Output If power never feels enough when it comes to your favorite tunes, then you’ll surely find our audio benchmark quite useful, as it allows you to find the handsets and tablets with the strongest speakers. We also measure power of the earphones output, but hey - be careful with that volume control - you’ll need those ears!. Battery Life Nothing can replace a reliable, long-lasting battery that can easily carry you and your smartphone through at least a day of heavy usage. Of course, you can always get one of those chubby battery cases, but how uncool would that be? Instead, we’d suggest that you take advantage of our battery life ratings, which are based on our own, custom-designed battery test, to see how the phones compare.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Taking an HDR pic (sec) Lower is better. CamSpeed score Higher is better. CamSpeed score with flash Higher is better. Headphones output power (Volts). We measure battery life by running a custom web-script, designed to replicate the power consumption of typical real-life usage. All devices that go through the test have their displays set at 200-nit brightness.. Galaxy S9 vs iPhone X hands-on: A battle royale. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ hands-on: Worthy of celebrity hands.

Rajeev Suri (President and CEO). [ˈnokiɑ] , UK : / ˈ n ɒ k i ə / , US : / ˈ n oʊ k i ə / ) is a Finnish multinational communications , information technology and consumer electronics company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo , in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area. [1] In 2017, Nokia employed approximately 102,000 people across over 100 countries, did business in more than 130 countries, and reported annual revenues of around €23 billion. [2] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. [3] It is the world's 415th-largest company measured by 2016 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500 , and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. The company has had various industries in its 152-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill and had long been associated with rubber and cables , but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures , technology development and licensing. [6] Nokia is a notable major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM , 3G and LTE standards (and currently in 5G ), and is best known for having been the largest worldwide vendor of mobile phones and smartphones for a period. After a partnership with Microsoft and market struggles, its mobile phone business was eventually bought by the former, [7] [8] creating Microsoft Mobile as its successor in 2014. [9] After the sale, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business and on the Internet of things , marked by the divestiture of its Here mapping division and the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent. The company also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings ), [10] [11] and is the owner of scientific research organization Bell Labs. [12] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through a licensing arrangement with HMD Global. The company is viewed with national pride by Finns , as its successful mobile phone business made it by far the largest worldwide company and brand from Finland. [14] At its peak in 2000, during the telecoms bubble , Nokia alone accounted for 4% of the country's GDP , 21% of total exports and 70% of the Helsinki Stock Exchange market capital. 2.3 Nokia Bell Labs. 3.1.1 Former corporate officers. 5.1 NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran. 5.3 Nokia–Apple patent dispute. 5.4 Alleged tax evasion in India.

(August 2015) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ). Main article: History of Nokia. Rolls of toilet paper produced by Nokia in the 1960s, Museum Centre Vapriikki, Tampere. Nokia's history dates back to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere , Finland (then in the Russian Empire ). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia , offering better hydropower resources. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin , formed a shared company from it and called it Nokia Ab (in Swedish , Nokia Company being the English equivalent), after the site of the second pulp mill.. Idestam retired in 1896, making Mechelin the company's chairman. Mechelin expanded into electricity generation by 1902 which Idestam had opposed. In 1904 Suomen Gummitehdas ( Finnish Rubber Works ), a rubber business founded by Eduard Polón, established a factory near the town of Nokia and used its name.. In 1922, Nokia Ab entered into a partnership with Finnish Rubber Works and Kaapelitehdas ( the Cable Factory ), all now jointly under the leadership of Polón. Finnish Rubber Works company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply, and the cable company soon did too.. Nokia at the time also made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s. LV 317M military radio in Hämeenlinna artillery museum. Nokia license built PRC-77 (-1177?) with signal amplifier.. In 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Kaapelitehdas and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created the new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for Finland's defence forces ( Puolustusvoimat ), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios , telephone switches , capacitors and chemicals .. After Finland's trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics among others; by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield high profits. Nokia also co-operated on scientific technology with the Soviet Union. government became increasingly suspicious of that technologic co-operation after the end of the Cold War détente in the early 1980s. Nokia imported many US-made components and used them for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle , Nokia had a secret co-operation with The Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia. [18] However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.. In 1977, Kari Kairamo became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called "Nordic Japan". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker Salora , followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker Luxor AB in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind Philips and Thomson ). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.. In 1987, Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's Standard Elektrik Lorenz (SEL), which included its "Schaub-Lorenz" and "Graetz" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the "ITT Nokia" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE), the predecessor of Alcatel , in 1986. On 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of Ericsson 's Information Systems, [19] which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters , minicomputers and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.. Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond 's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically CEO Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.. In 1987, Kaapelitehdas discontinued production of cables at its Helsinki factory after 44 years, effectively shutting down the sub-company..

Jorma Ollila , who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006. Following Simo Vuorilehto 's appointment as CEO, a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres ( Nokian Renkaat ), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK -based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory , and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.. Vuorilehto quit in early 1992 and was replaced by Jorma Ollila. He saw that despite troubles in the economy, Nokia's cellular business was booming. As a result, he decided to focus on wireless telecommunications and to get rid of non-core assets. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years.. Nokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the Mobira Cityman 900 in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the GSM mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with Siemens , the predecessor to Nokia Siemens Network. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900. MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by Radiolinja. In November 1992, the Nokia 1011 launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone. Salora Oy as a Nokia subsidiary ended in 1989 when the division was merged into Nokia-Mobira Oy. The brand continued to be used for televisions until 1995.. On 12 June 1996, Nokia announced the sale of its television business to Canada/Hong Kong-based Semi-Tech Corporation. [21] The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included a factory in Turku , and the rights to use the Nokia, Finlux , Luxor , Salora , Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999. [22] Some of these brands were later sold to other companies.. Nokia was the first to launch digital satellite receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997. [23] In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with Common Interface (CI) support. [24] In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world's first digital terrestrial television set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as ONdigital. In October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand, [26] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone. [27] Nokia's mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake , which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company's most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100 , in 2003.. Nokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with stereo speakers and a sub-woofer. [28] In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first wireless LAN products. [29] In January 2000 ViewSonic acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making displays for personal computers. [30] On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with Telefonica to supply DSL modems and routers in Spain. In 1998, Nokia co-founded Symbian Ltd. led by Psion to create a new operating system for PDAs as a successor of EPOC32. In 2001 Nokia created the Series 60 platform on Symbian OS , later introducing it with their first camera phone , the Nokia 7650. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest smartphone hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd. [32] Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the Symbian Foundation as its successor. In 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people. A collection of Nokia mobile phones from the 2000s. The Nokia 3600/3650 was the first camera phone on sale in North America in 2003. The company would go on to become a successful and innovative camera phone maker. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker Carl Zeiss AG. [35] That same month Nokia introduced the Nseries , which would become its flagship line of smart phones for the next six years. [36] The Nokia N95 introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as "best mobile imaging device" in Europe in 2007. [37] Its successor the N82 featured a xenon flash, [38] which helped it win the award of "best mobile imaging" device in Europe in 2008. [39] The N93 in 2006 was known for its specialized camcorder and the twistable design that switches between clamshell and a camcorder-like position. [40] They were also well known for the N8 with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the 808 PureView in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the Lumia 920 flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced PureView technologies. In 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the handheld gaming market with the N-Gage. [42] Nokia's head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted " Game Boy is for 10-year-olds", [43] stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader Nintendo. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008. Nokia launched mobile TV trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster Yle. The services are based on the DVB-H standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen Nokia 7710 smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals. [45] Nokia partnered with Arqiva and O2 to launch trials in the UK in September 2005. In 2005 Nokia developed a Linux -based operating system called Maemo , which shipped that year on the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet .. On 1 June 2006, Jorma Ollila became the company's chairman and retired as CEO, replaced by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo. A flagship Nokia store in Sao Paulo , Brazil in 2009. In August 2007, Nokia introduced Ovi , an umbrella name for the company's new Internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the Nokia Music Store. [48] The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against Apple 's App Store when it was introduced in 2008. In October 2008 Nokia announced the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic , the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. In November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in Japan because of low market share. Nokia briefly returned to the computer market with the Booklet 3G netbook in August 2009.. A Nokia 9000 Communicator (1996) next to a Nokia E7 Communicator (2011). In April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8 , which would be the first to run on Symbian^3. [51] However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company's image, [52] especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and it was announced that Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history. The old Symbian OS became completely open source in February 2010. [54] However, in November 2010 it was announced that the Symbian Foundation was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing. [55] By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier NTT DoCoMo in Japan, after both Samsung and Sony Ericsson moved to Android. Meanwhile, in 2010 for Nokia's Linux ambitions, Nokia collaborated with Intel to form the MeeGo project, after the merger of Nokia's own Maemo and Intel's Moblin .. Nokia's Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of iOS and Android. To counter this, Nokia planned to make their MeeGo Linux operating system the company's flagship on smartphones. However, in February 2011, they scrapped MeeGo and announce a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone as Nokia's primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority. Although the MeeGo-based N9 was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia - apparently pressured by Microsoft [ citation needed ] - had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership. After the announcement of the Microsoft deal, Nokia's market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia's focus and attention would be elsewhere. [56] Nokia's first Windows Phone flagship was the Lumia 800 , which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012, with the company's stock price falling below $2, Nokia almost became bankrupt. On 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as "compensation for lost income from his prior employer," on top of his $1.4 million annual salary. [59] This was a turning point, since Elop has previously been a Microsoft employee in its Business Division. It later became clear that Microsoft was influential within Nokia, pushing forward its Windows Phone offering.. When the Lumia 920 was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly. [60] Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation: [61] the company had had huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft. [62] The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, as well as for Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer , who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company. [63] The sale was completed in April 2014, with Microsoft Mobile becoming the successor to Nokia's mobile devices division.. By 2014, Nokia's global brand value according to Interbrand fell to 98th place, [64] a sharp slide from the 5th place it was in 2009. Former Nokia plant in Bochum , Germany. A Nokia advertising sign in Dublin , Ireland. In July 2013, Nokia bought Siemens ' stake in the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture for $2.2 billion, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary called Nokia Solutions and Networks, [66] until being rebranded as Nokia Networks soon after. [67] During Nokia's financial struggles, its profitable networking division with Siemens provided much of its income; thus, the purchase proved to be positive, particularly after the sale of its mobile devices unit. After the sale of its mobile devices division, Nokia focused on network equipment through Nokia Networks. In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a US$970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015. On 17 November 2014, Nokia Technologies head Ramzi Haidamus disclosed that the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business as an original design manufacturer , licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. Haidamus stated that the Nokia brand was "valuable" but "is diminishing in value, and that's why it is important that we reverse that trend very quickly, imminently." [71] The next day, Nokia unveiled the N1 , an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn , as its first product following the Microsoft sale. [72] Haidamus emphasized that devices released under these licensing agreements would be held to high standards in production quality, and would "look and feel just like Nokia built it." [6] Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri stated that the company planned to re-enter the mobile phone business in this manner in 2016, following the expiration of its non-compete clause with Microsoft. According to Robert Morlino, the spokesman of Nokia Technologies, Nokia planned follow the brand-licensing model rather than direct marketing of mobile devices due to the sale of its mobile devices division to Microsoft. [74] The company took aggressive steps to revitalize itself, evident through its hiring of software experts, testing of new products and seeking of sales partners. [75] On 14 July 2015, CEO Rajeev Suri confirmed that the company would make a return to the mobile phones market in 2016. On 28 July 2015, Nokia announced OZO, a 360-degrees virtual reality camera, with eight 2K optical image sensors. The division behind the product, Nokia Technologies, claimed that OZO would be the most advanced VR film-making platform. [77] Nokia's press release stated that OZO would be "the first in a planned portfolio of digital media solutions," with more technologic products expected in the future. [78] OZO was fully unveiled on 30 November in Los Angeles. The OZO, designed for professional use, was intended for retail for US$60,000; [79] however, its price was decreased by $15,000 prior to release, [80] and is listed on its official website as $40,000. Nokia office building in Markham , Ontario , Canada in 2016 - originally Alcatel-Lucent's office. A Nokia Flexi Zone base transceiver station (2015). On 14 April 2015, Nokia confirmed that it was in talks with the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent regarding a potential merger. [82] The next day, Nokia officially announced that it had agreed to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6 billion in an all-stock deal. [83] CEO Rajeev Suri felt that the purchase would give Nokia a strategic advantage in the development of 5G wireless technologies. [84] [85] The acquisition created a stronger competitor to the rival firms Ericsson and Huawei , [86] whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. Nokia shareholders hold 66.5% of the new combined company, while Alcatel-Lucent shareholders hold 33.5%. The Bell Labs division was to be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand would be replaced by Nokia. [83] [87] In October 2015, following approval of the deal by China's Ministry of Commerce, the merger awaited approval by French regulators. [88] Despite the initial intent of selling the submarine cable division separately, Alcatel-Lucent later declared that it would not. [89] The merger closed on 14 January 2016, [90] but was not complete until 3 November 2016. From the acquisition Nokia is now also the owner of the Alcatel mobile phone brand , which continues to be licensed to TCL Corporation .. On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of BMW , Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group for €2.8 billion. [91] The deal closed on 3 December 2015. On 26 April 2016, Nokia announced its intent to acquire connected health device maker Withings for US$191 million. The company was integrated into a new Digital Health unit of Nokia Technologies. On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile sold its Nokia-branded feature phone business to HMD Global , a new company founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn 's FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017. [95] [96] At Mobile World Congress , HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, as well as a re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 feature phone. [97] [98] While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.. On 28 June 2016 Nokia demonstrated for the first time ever a 5G -ready network. [99] In February 2017 Nokia carried out a 5G connection in Oulu , Finland using the 5GTF standard, backed by Verizon , on Intel architecture-based equipment. On 5 July 2017, Nokia and Xiaomi announced that they have signed a business collaboration agreement and a multi-year patent agreement, including a cross license to each company's cellular standard essential patents. In 2017, Nokia's brand value jumped 147 places to 188th place compared to 2016 in the Brand Finance ranking. Its rise has been attributed to its health portfolio and new mobile phones developed by HMD Global. On 19 January 2018, Nokia signed a deal with NTT Docomo , Japan's largest mobile operator, to provide 5G wireless radio base stations in the country by 2020. On 29 January 2018, Nokia introduced the ReefShark line of 5G chipsets , claiming that it triples bandwidth to 84 Gbps. [104] It will be released by Q3 2018.

In 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks , a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG , reportedly provided Iran 's monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens. [160] The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use deep packet inspection to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes". During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009 , Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to use of deep packet inspection. In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging. Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a "lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls" and that it "has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran". In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking. [165] Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed. [166] The Finnish media dubbed the law Lex Nokia because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.. The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of Hämeenlinna had recently given the required notice. In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. District Court of Delaware claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer. [168] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers". [169] Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the iPhone , Macintosh and iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010. In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia. [170] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies. Nokia's Indian subsidiary has been charged with non-payment of TDS and transgressing transfer pricing norms in India. [173] The unpaid TDS of ₹ 30. billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company. ^ a b "Nokia" (in Finnish).
