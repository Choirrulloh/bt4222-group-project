Mine is 2.5 years old now and I'm still happy with its performance. I use Link2SD with a 64GB SD card. The only issue encountered was that the second partition had to begin within the first 32GB of.... A lot of the complaints on here seem to be about the G4 instead of the 4G! I like this phone a lot, very reliable. A combination of Lineage 15.1 for the Oreo experience, an SD card, a decent app-to-SD app and a decent RAM booster app is best. Its available for this phone, installed it on my old Moto G 4G and I should say, it completely feels like a new phone. Made the UI look just like the Pixel..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Motorola Moto G (4G LTE) review:. Best budget phone gets even better with 4G LTE, but a little pricier too. Motorola Moto G (4G LTE) - white. (Part #: Moto G LTE White). Motorola Moto G (4G LTE) - black. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Motorola Moto G has one of the best screens you can get for the price, plenty of power for the everyday essentials, an easy to use, near-stock version of Android KitKat and the addition of 4G LTE and expandable storage are extremely welcome.. The Bad The camera isn't up to anything more than the odd snap in good lighting, and the addition of 4G LTE means its once "unbelievable bargain" price is now only "good value".. The Bottom Line Although the Motorola Moto G with 4G LTE is a bit pricier than its 3G-only sibling, it still has one of the best displays in the budget arena, its processor makes operation enjoyably smooth and its rounded, compact body is both comfortable and attractive. If you're after an affordable all-round entrance into the high speeds of 4G, you've come to the right place.. Design and display Android KitKat software Processor and battery performance. Editors' note (September 5, 2014): Motorola has announced the sequel to this phone, the 2014 Motorola Moto G .. With the Moto G , Motorola threw a giant spanner in the works of the mobile world. Its lineup of mid-range specs were paired with an amazingly low price, making it the best value phone by a country mile. It made reviewing phones somewhat repetitive -- time after time I was forced to conclude, "This phone is fine, but the Moto G offers the same performance for much less money.". Its only downsides were a lack of expandable storage and no 4G LTE. In the UK, that wasn't much of a problem as 4G was still very new and still rather expensive. In the US, 4G was much more common, so its omission was more of an issue. Motorola has rectified both, adding 4G and a microSD card slot to this new revamped version of the Moto G.. It remains the same in every other respect, except price -- you still get the best screen at the price, a very capable quad-core processor, a 5-megapixel camera and the latest version of Android, 4.4.3 KitKat.. New Moto G shows off its 4G LTE and microSD slot (pictures). It's on sale now in the UK for free on contracts starting from £19 per month at retailers such as Phones 4U , or SIM-free for £149 with 8GB of built-in storage from Amazon. In the US, you can get the phone directly from Motorola's online store for $219 off-contract. In Australia, the Moto G is AU$299 -- just AU$50 more than the non-4G original.. That's a small increase on the 3G Moto G's price of £119 or $179 unlocked, with the older version continuing to be on sale alongside the new one. Motorola also has another new phone for you, though, and it's even cheaper: the $130/£90/AU$179 Moto E. You can read all about the Moto E here .. Although it now packs a 4G LTE radio inside, the Moto G remains physically unchanged. I found the older Moto G's 4.5-inch body to be very comfortable to hold, thanks to its curved back, which fits snugly into your palm. The new model is exactly as comfortable. It's also not so big as to make you dislocate your thumb every time you try to type with one hand.. The plastic back panels are interchangeable and there are a host of different colours available, along with ruggedised cases and flip covers that protect the screen. The Moto G is also now in white, although the white model is not quite as widely available. I was keen on the new hue at the launch event -- it definitely brightens it up, particularly when it's paired with a light-coloured back, so I'm hoping it becomes easier to get hold of soon.. Underneath the swappable cover is the microSD card slot. The lack of expandable storage was a disappointment on the older Moto G, as it was only available with 8 or 16GB. While 16GB is probably adequate for most people, if you were shopping on a budget and only wanted to spring for the 8GB model, you'd quickly find yourself running out of space once you've downloaded your favourite apps and songs. The new model comes with only 8GB, but with the option to pop in 32GB microSD cards (available for around £10, or $15), storage shouldn't be an issue.. The 4.5-inch display has a 1,280x720-pixel resolution, giving a really good density of 326 pixels per inch. Couple that with its high brightness, vivid colours and decent viewing angles, and the Moto G has easily the best screen available on a budget phone.. Motorola doesn't seem to have fiddled with the display on the 4G model, which still looks every bit as crisp and bold as before, outperforming similar budget 4G phones such as the EE Kestrel (which is UK-only) and the Nokia Lumia 635. Both those phones can be picked up for £100 (around $170, although US prices are yet to be confirmed), which is a decent chunk of cash.. The Moto G first launched last year with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean on board, but was updated to 4.4.2 KitKat in January. The 4G model comes with KitKat as standard, with new features such as the ability to display video and games at full screen without the navigation buttons taking up space. It also lets you search for local businesses directly from the contacts app.. Unlike most manufacturers, who like to put their own stamp on Android, Motorola has done very little to the interface. In fact, it's pretty much stock Android, so if you've ever used an Android device before, there'll be nothing new here for you to get your head around. The G does have a couple of additions, including Motorola Assist, which performs set tasks such as automatically silencing your phone when you have a meeting scheduled.. Thanks to the almost complete lack of any interface tweaks by Motorola, the Android experience is extremely easy to get to grips with, whether you're an Android veteran or completely new to the smartphone world.. The 4G Moto G has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor as the previous version. It's a 1.2GHz quad-core affair, backed up by 1GB of RAM, and I found it to be more than powerful enough for most common tasks. Instagramming food and sending horrific selfies over WhatsApp were handled without any issue.. It turned its hand to demanding games like Asphalt 8 fairly well, although frame rates did drop at times -- more basic games like Cut The Rope are well within its capabilities.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News.

Moto is one of the best phones considering its price tag.I have been using this phone for quite a while and I feel that this phone is awesome.The battery had some issues in the beginning but now it works perfectly fine.

Well, this phone is really superb as much as I know I researched a lot about it coz i want value for my money. I was looking for the phone that will suit my needed specifications. for more than 2 months I was looking and wasn't satisfied with any of the phone in the market. good phones are too costly and I was unable to decide which phone to choose. I am careless I usually carry keys in pocket with phone and scratches makes me feel that my phone is getting old. I am tired of charging my old phone 2-3 times a day. fast processor I am not that much into mobile gaming coz I prefer my PC for gaming purpose still I need a good response when I order my phone to open an app it should do it in blink of eye else its dead mister.. 4.I also needed a good display and good sound quality I love music and a little show off among friends,. 5 a camera good enough for casual use mostly for instagram and facebook. What I am getting is -. Corning gorilla 3 protection which is scratch proof even if you try to scratch it with keys. water resistant (oops I accidentally put my phone with my clothes to wash good lord its alive). snapdragon 400 1.2 gh (I saw reviews on youtube and its almost as fast as nexus 4 that is 25k sometimes it was faster than samsung s4 ). 4.display is awesome 326pixels per inch on a 4.5 inch screen and that on an apple iphone 4s its 329ppi on a 4 inch screen Impressive!!! moto g. 5.According to one of the reviews in youtube the call clarity in other phones is better but the noise cancellation in moto g is better so I guess it is for me coz i mostly work in noisy surrounding.. the camera is not the best but in good light it will give you decent images with bright colors and it records 720p hd so nothing to question.. customizable colored covers which will never let you feel bored the color options are really good bright and lively. 8.Dual sim - avail the best std and local offers by two service providers. the phone gives 50 gb google drive space for 2 years. 10 the phone is usb otis compatible you can connect a 32 GB pendrive if extra space is needed(although i don't need it I already spent 50k on my laptop and 5k on an external drive for storage. 13 GB that is available is decent for me ). I think in India we are getting charger and headphones i hope so. NFC(near field communication) only yesterday i came to know what nfc means and believe me you are not going to use it even if you get it so dont waste ur hard earned money unless ur dad is having an audi or a mercedes. 2.expandable memory (boy that really feels but why didnt they just add an expandable slot. rest everything is there as far as my requirements are concerned. As a whole I found what I was searching for 2 months and at a price less than what my budget, actually I was looking for a phone in the range 15-16k and I got this one in 14k so high cheer and Rs1000 for beer....

Processor same as last model, screen resolution hasn't increased. The Moto X4 is a pretty decent mid-range Android handset. Gallery: Motorola Moto G 4G review. Gallery: Motorola Moto G 4G review. The very latest Moto G adds 4G for fast internet downloads and streaming. But the other one's still available. The 4G -capable version of the Moto G looks pretty much the same as the other Moto G -- same sleek simplicity, same rounded back to offset its bulkiness made from tactile non-slip rubberised plastic. It's exactly the same size too, but around 6g heavier to accommodate a heavier battery and the 4G gubbins.. The screen, now expanded to 5in from the original Moto G's 4.5in has once again retained the same resolution of standard HD 1280x720, making it just a little less sharp as the pixels are spread over a greater area. It's still bright and sharp enough though, and absolutely no shame at this price point.. This version of the Moto G launches with Android 5.0 Lollipop (the non-4G version came with KitKat, though an update is now available) and we're fast warming to its flat 'n' fast style.. The Moto X4 is a pretty decent mid-range Android handset. The quad-core processor hasn't been beefed up any, it's still clocked at 1.2GHz which is a perfectly decent spec for a budget phone like this. Our AnTuTu benchmark test gave it a score of 19,122 which puts it comfortably in line with several midrange phones costing considerably more. It's light on its feet and showed no sign of slowdown when opening apps or even playing HD games, which it handled without any hassle.. It's nice to see an 8 megapixel on a budget phone, especially one with a wider than usual f/2 lens and which allows you to switch aspect ratio between 4:3 and widescreen 16:9. It includes autofocus and an LED flash, plus a few extras like touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama modes. Picture quality is pretty good overall, with a decent level of detail and the auto settings stand good for most snaps. There's also a 2 megapixel snapper on the front for video calls and selfies which is nothing exceptional, but it's certainly no embarrassment either.. There's 16GB memory on board, but you can bump that up by another 32GB via microSD card - a bit stingy all told, especially with other phones able to accommodate 128GB cards. Like the other Moto G it's available in both single and dual-SIM versions, so it's easy to keep work and play separate, or load a foreign SIM if you're going abroad.. The battery is a little bigger than the non-4G version but not by much. You can still expect to get more than a full day of steady use out of it.. The 4G version of the latest generation Moto G is pretty much the same phone but a teensy bit heavier and with a slightly bigger battery. Oh, and it's got 4G, for about the same price. It's a no-brainer, this is the one to go for, and despite no improvement to the original Moto G's processor, and the drop in screen resolution, it's still the budget phone to beat.. 8 megapixel with autofocus, LED flash; 2 megapixel front-facing camera.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 1.0 out of 5 stars Motorola Software Fail - No Repair as 15 days beyond 12mth Warranty. Colour: Black | Style: SIM-Free | Verified Purchase. I bought this phone on 14-Jul-14 and received it on 16-Jul-14, I used the phone without incident until 29-Jul-15 when the phone stopped displaying, the screen went blank, I went online and tried various restarts of the phone but none of these worked and I was advised to return the device to the Motorola Repair Centre which I did on the same day. On 04-Aug-15 I was advised that the phone was out of warranty (by 15 days) and that I would have to pay to have the phone repaired, and to expect a quote via email. Really...? The phone was otherwise in mint condition, it had a screen protector and was kept in a protective case, it had been lovingly looked after and had clearly failed due to Motorola's faulty software. What really stinks is Motorola hiding behind the phone being 15 days outside of their 12 month warranty period, would you choose to do business with such a company...? Not me, my replacement phone will not be from Motorola. I strongly recommend that you avoid purchasing any devices from Motorola, shame on them...!!!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Superb value. Colour: White | Style: SIM-Free | Verified Purchase. This phone has exceeded all my expectations. All the comparable phones I looked at cost considerably more. I just wanted a straightforward Android phone with a fair-sized screen for browsing the internet and the facility for adding more memory for any apps I might desire. Importantly, I wanted it future-proofed with 4G compatibility, a standard which will soon become the norm. Another item on my wish list was a physical keyboard; but I had to strike that one off, since they are obsolete these days. I had been used to texting with physical keypads, and so I was concerned that I would struggle with a screen keyboard. I found I could type almost as fast and as accurately on the Moto. The screen is responsive, the battery life is fair, the processing power is pretty good and the camera takes reasonable shots. I use maps quite a bit and the GPS sensor does not take long to locate my position. At the price this phone is offered, you cannot sensibly expect any accompanying accessories; and you won't get any. There are no earphones or charger. Unlike in the old days, chargers are now universal and you can find them anywhere. You can even charge it from your computer. This phone is one of the best buys I have made in a long time.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Can get better than this in the android world for the price!!. Colour: Black | Style: SIM-Free | Verified Purchase. I bought this as a stop gap to see out my contract when my flagship phone broke and the warranty wouldn't cover it. However a couple of months turned into well over a year of ownership, and I don't plan on retiring it just yet. It is a great size, big enough for the occasional game and reading ebooks, but small enough to fit in any pocket without noticing it is there. The memory is a little small these days with on 8gb total. But nothing that a 32gb SD card doesn't resolve. Great all round phone for a bargain price.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Could be brilliant if it lasts!. Colour: Black | Style: SIM-Free | Verified Purchase. I have had this phone for several weeks now and it seems to be spot on, better overall than my previous Galaxy S3 Mini in terms of performance, and it comes close in terms of features too. 4G is slick, occasionally slicker than say a pubs Cloud internet access, or average entry level home internet connection. The screen is good and the phone is quite light and not too bulky, but only just. As in other reviews I have seen, the camera isn't so hot, but 720p video is decent enough and a standard mugshot in good light is easily acceptable. Call quality isn't as crystal clear as it should be and neither does the phone come with a charger, so don't bin your old Samsung one! If you download a good File Manager (because there isnt one installed as standard) then amongst other things you can add custom ringtones very easily. I was also incredibly impressed with Motorolas Migrate software that transfers all your old phones info across to the new one using a wifi connection. Almost nothing was lost during transfer including texts or photos for me. Presuming that the Motorola G will last me ideally 18 to 24 months with average use across the board, then for the price I would say right now that this is a fantastic phone for someone like me who does not require a high end unit, and is certainly not addicted to texting, gaming or any other phone related activity :). Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars 8 gb internal memory isn't enough, SD card useless. Colour: Black | Style: SIM-Free | Verified Purchase. UPDATE: Some months later, with more apps and Android 5.1 installed, this phone is pretty much USELESS. Google won't let you move any of their apps to the SD card, and many other big apps (Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter...) can't be move either. Even among the apps that "can" be moved to the SD card, a lot of the data remains in the phone's internal memory. Right now my phone can't update apps because I don't have enough storage space, even though my 32gb SD card is almost empty. I simply can't use it because of how Android works. You NEED a phone with MUCH MORE than 8gb of internal memory if you want to use Android in 2015. ---------------------------------------------- [Old review, with fewer apps installed an a lighter version of Android installed] I had this phone for several months now, and it works perfectly. You don't get anything this good for this price in any other brand. All the apps that I need work ok, and even a few modern games (although I don't play with my phone much, but it can take Fifa 14 with no issues, in case you are interested). It's big but not so much that it becomes uncomfortable to hold, and it fits in my jeans pockets perfectly. I added a Kingston 32gb micro-SD card, and it worked with no problems at all. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Excellent purchase good value a good every phone.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Very pleased indeed.. The phone is slow, I'm not sure if this was pre-owned as there is apps on it that I think someone downloaded not factory done, I had one of these phones before and it was faster... 1.0 out of 5 stars wouldn't buy again. Good little phone Ideal for my wife.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good phone. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. an ok mobile , but im let down a bit with the headphone socket , only get sound from 1 cup & its erratic a lot , cant get rid of the problem at all , headphones work flawlessly... 3.0 out of 5 stars an ok mobile, but im let down a bit .... Great wee phone great price. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Cheap phone with expensive performance and most of all a great battery life. 5.0 out of 5 stars Moto G for people who want performance on a budget. I still use it, its got a tough screen and runs fairly well. I like to use it to browse and web surf + listen to music, the camera is kinda weak I can't get a good pic using it.. 4.0 out of 5 stars nioooce. Had high expectations on buying this phone but sadly the one I received suffered badly from the phantom key problem. 1.0 out of 5 stars Phantom Key Problem.

With 4G and speed boost the new Moto E is a better buy than Moto G 4G. SHOULD I BUY MOTOROLA MOTO E 4G?. Motorola has upgraded its super-budget Moto E smartphone for 2015. The new Motorola Moto E has received some useful hardware upgrades for faster performance, and comes in a version with 4G LTE, making it a better buy than the Moto G 4G. Read our new Motorola Moto E review. The new Moto E is one of the best budget phones you can buy right now.

Motorola Moto E 4G / New Moto E review: Connectivity. Motorola Moto E 4G / New Moto E review: Software. Motorola Moto E 4G / New Moto E review: Battery life. Motorola has upgraded its super-budget smartphone , the Moto E, for 2015. The new Motorola Moto E has received some useful hardware upgrades for faster performance, and comes in a version with 4G LTE, making it a better buy than the Moto G 4G. (Also see: Best budget smartphones 2015 .). Motorola's 4G Moto E is available now at £109. Note that many networks will also require you to buy a £10 top-up, however. For example, you can buy the Moto E 4G on O2's network from Amazon for £119. The non-4G model will be available in the US, Latin America and India from 3 March, with other countries to follow. That 3G version will cost $119.99 in the US, but a UK price is not yet known. (Also see new Motorola Moto E UK release date, price and specs .). At £109 this budget 4G phone. goes up against the likes of the EE Kestrel. and Doogee F1 Turbo Mini. With some useful hardware upgrades that we'll outline below, the Moto E is no longer just a cheap phone for first-time or light users, but a proper Android smartphone that is more than capable enough for day-to-day use. (Also see: Best cheap 4G phones .). Throughout this review you'll see how we've compared the new Moto E 4G to other budget phones such as the EE Kestrel and Doogee F1 Turbo Mini. The more obvious comparison is to Motorola's own Moto G, of course. (Also see: Old Moto E vs new Moto E .). The Moto G has had a bit of an odd history, first sold as a 3G phone ( mk 1, reviewed ), then upgraded to 4G ( mk 2, reviewed ), and then a second version was released without 4G ( mk 3 ). Motorola has since told our Mikael Ricknas that it would never again sell a (new) 4G version of the Motorola Moto G in the UK, which is weird, given that it's just added 4G connectivity to the entry-level model in the line-up.. So ignoring the fact the mk 2 Moto G, which comes with 4G, is now over a year old, is there any reason why you might choose to buy the Moto G 4G over the Moto E 4G?. Sold SIM-free at the Carphone Warehouse. for £139, this £30 cheaper Motorola Moto E matches or improves on many of its core specs. Placed on the desk in front of me the difference in size and weight is barely noticeable (the Moto G 4G is just 2g lighter and only 0.7mm thinner). The new Moto E 4G has a newer processor, faster graphics and a larger-capacity battery. Meanwhile, the Moto G 4G has a slightly higher-resolution still-4.5in screen at 1280x720 (326ppi vs the 245ppi of the new Moto E), and an LED flash at the rear. Worth an extra £30? No chance.. The new Moto E 4G is very similar in its design to the original Moto E , with the same curved rear, chunky design that feels good in the hand, and reasonably thin screen bezel. It's lost one of the two metal bars at the front, now with just the one at the top to hide the speaker. For a budget phone, it looks pretty good.. Whereas you could change the rear shell on the original Moto E, with this new version you can also change the grippy band that runs around its edge, allowing you to mix-and-match colours and create your own design. Motorola shells and bands are sold separately, though, and the Moto E ships with matching black or white shell and band. (also see Best smartphones 2015. and Best Android phones 2015 .). A key difference is the slightly larger screen. Now a Kestrel-matching 4.5in rather than the 4.3in we saw in the original Moto E, the Motorola offers slightly more screen space on which to watch videos and play games. The resolution hasn't changed, though, meaning this qHD (540x960) IPS display has a slightly lower pixel density of 245- rather than 256ppi. Show us the difference and we'll show you a liar.. The display itself is good for the price, bright and reasonably clear for a qHD screen. IPS tech means colours are true and viewing angles are good. The Moto E's screen is now splashproof; it also has an anti-smudge coating and is protected with Gorilla Glass 3.. Despite the increase in screen size, the new Moto E is just 3g heavier than the original. The reassuringly heavy 145g smartphone is the same width at 12.3mm, which is a tell-tale sign of its budget price, and just a little longer and wider at 66.8x129.9mm.. The new Moto E features several hardware upgrades. It still has a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, but the 410 chip seen here is quad- rather than dual-core. Memory is the same, at 1GB, while storage has doubled to 8GB. As before you can add up to 32GB via microSD. (Neither the memory or storage allocations would be anything to shout about with a flagship phone, but at this price they're very reasonable.) And where the original featured the Adreno 302 GPU, this new Moto E has the 306.. We ran the new Moto E 4G through our usual benchmarks and were pleasantly surprised with its performance. Whereas the original managed 608 points in Geekbench 3.0's multi-core component, the new Moto E recorded 1463. In the single-core component we saw 464 points. In terms of raw performance, that makes it significantly faster than the original Moto E, quite a bit faster than the EE Kestrel, and lagging only the Doogee F1 (but that's a grey-market phone, and you may prefer to stick with one intended for sale in the UK).. In SunSpider it lagged those phones with its 1301ms score, but again saw a marked improvement over the original Moto E's 1877ms. And it was the same story for graphics performance, with the new Moto E 4G turning in 6fps in Manhattan and 13fps in T-Rex (the original managed 5fps in Manhattan and 11fps in T-Rex). You can compare these results to all the phones we've recently tested in our article what's the fastest smartphone 2015 .. In actual use, the new Moto E feels pretty swift in general, but there can be annoying delays when opening apps. There's also slight hesitancy when navigating around Lollipop, but nothing you won't quickly get used to.. One of the additions to the new Moto E is a front-facing camera. It's only a VGA model, and not much cop for selfies (although you can set a timer), but those looking to Skype or video chat through other means will appreciate its presence.. As before the rear camera is 5Mp, here with a f2.2 aperture, 4x digital zoom and several features such as a burst mode, auto HDR, tap to focus and quick capture. HD (720p) video is supported at 30fps, and there's also a slo-mo video mode. There's no LED flash, which is not at all unusual for a budget phone, but it's a pain if you were hoping to use your phone as a torch.. The results are very much the same as we saw from the original Moto E. Images are generally well exposed, but lack detail and reveal heavy-handed compression when you zoom in and look closely. They're fine for sharing online, but won't produce good enlargements for printing to put on the wall.. A neat feature of this new Moto E is its ability to quickly launch the camera with a quick double-flick of your wrist, even if the phone is in standby. As usual, you'll need to change the default aspect ratio in the camera app from 16:9 to 4:3 in order to get the full resolution of the sensor, otherwise you'll be getting 3.7Mp images.. Here's our usual shot of St Pancras. (All are original 5Mp photos from the phone - unedited and not resized.). Video is understandably shaky since there's no stabilisation. However, it is captured in HD now - 1280x720 as opposed to the 854x480 of the old Moto E. It is much better than the old phone and colours are decent enough, but detail is lacking compared to the best smartphone video (possibly due to compression again) and it isn't particularly sharp, either:. Here's the key change in the new Moto E: for an extra £20 over the original it includes 4G connectivity, operating on LTE bands 1, 3, 7 and 20. You can learn more about 4G in our complete guide to 4G , but suffice to say it is the fastest mobile data standard, and both network coverage and pricing within the UK is getting better all the time.. Other connectivity specs remain unchanged, and the new Moto E 4G features Bluetooth 4.0 LE, 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and GPS.. Whereas the original Moto E ran Android KitKat, the new Moto E 4G has Lollipop version 5.0 out of the box. Amazingly, for such a cheap phone, Motorola is also guaranteeing an upgrade to the next version of Android. Read more about Android M. and what we want to see from Android M. It's a reasonably plain implementation of Lollipop, but with some unique Moto software features. It can show notifications without waking the screen, and monitor your activity to create useful new features and functions. Motorola Assist keeps your screen off while you sleep or in a meeting, plus there's the double-twist gesture we mentioned earlier to launch the camera. Motorola Migrate also features, easing the transition from your old phone, and there's Motorola Alert, which can share your location with your friends and family.. Motorola has also upgraded the Moto E's battery. Whereas before it was fitted with a 1980mAh battery it now has 2390mAh. That's perhaps not a big a jump as it sounds, given the faster hardware, although Android Lollipop *should* be more efficient than KitKat.. We've not had this phone long enough to thoroughly test the battery, but early indications are very good, and we're sure the 'E will last a full day with mixed use, just as Motorola claims..

Motorola's 5-incher finds the G-spot: Moto G 4G budget Android smartie. Does it all and does it respectably, unless you want a fat camera. Review Back in December 2013, I hailed the first generation Motorola Moto G as the best affordable smartphone on the market. If you want a reasonably compact 4.5-inch device, then, arguably, it still is the best, thanks to a midlife facelift that added a microSD slot and 4G reception.. A larger, Mk.II 3G-only version was released late last year and now a 4G incarnation of the same has rocked up. Time, then, to see then if the newcomer has tipped the old boy off his throne.. There is a strong sense of deja vu about the new 4G Moto G. The excellent build quality, water resistant coating, simple but elegant design and straightforward arrangement of the controls and ports are all still in evidence.. Nothing fancy about the controls but they work well. Yet there are some significant differences between both the first and second generation models and the 3G and 4G versions of the latter. The most obvious distinction between the original and new model is that the display is bigger, up from 4.5 inches to 5 inches.. Even so, the resolution remains the same at 720 x 1280 and, consequently, the pixel density has dropped from 326ppi to 294ppi. Don’t let that put you off. It is still more than sharp enough to my eyes. Side by side with a 4.5-inch Moto G there’s little, if any, discernible difference.. The panel itself is an IPS LCD affair and – like that fitted to the original Moto G – it delivers vibrant colours and supports very broad viewing angles. Strangely the maximum brightness is noticeably less than on the Mk.I Moto G, so it’s less easy to see what's afoot out of doors. To avoid shattering experiences, a sheet of good old Gorilla Glass 3 covers the display.. 3.5mm jack slap bang in the middle at the top. Should the Mk.II Moto G have been given a higher resolution screen? I imagine the engineers at Motorola thought that sacrificing a pretty marginal amount of sharpness was a price worth paying for a display that goes easier on the battery. The new 4G Moto G boasts a fixed 2,390mAh battery, up from 2,070mAh in the 3G version and the 4G 4.5-inch model. Granted, 4G communication is more power hungry but the extra capacity still gives the latest G longer endurance in everyday use.. Battery fixed and no second SIM-card slot. Looping a 720p video with Wi-Fi on and the volume at maximum drained the battery in nine hours. That’s and hour more than the KitKat-equipped Mk.I 3G Moto G managed. Getting a full day of heavy use from the new Moto G really wasn’t much of a challenge.. Minds Mastering Machines - Call for papers now open. Huawei guns for Apple with Mac-alike Matebook X.

Motorola Moto G 4G LTE Smartphone Review. Motorola's best-selling smartphone ever packs enormous value for a sub-$230 price.. Written and Tested by Chris Thomas. Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. Our picks and opinions are independent from any business incentives.. This review was published on August 29, 2014. Since then, this product may have been discontinued or replaced. Pricing and availability may differ from what is stated in the review.. It's hard to get excited by entry-level gadgets. Though some are truly praiseworthy, the bottom of the barrel isn't what you want to show off to your friends and family. Even those that succeed usually do so by being ersatz knockoffs of better devices; squint hard enough and you might not notice the cracks.. Until just recently a decent full-priced smartphone would run you $700, leaving you to stick with dumb, feature-less phones or sign up for a two-year contract. Phones like the Motorola Moto G with LTE (MSRP $219.99 unlocked) are here to change that.. Though it's not the best phone, the Moto G's got very respectable hardware with Motorola cutting only the slightest of corners. Not only does it have the performance to hang with higher-end phones, it's got killer battery life, a durable design, and a pretty nice screen.. This phone isn't cheap, it's affordable.. A no frills, fully-loaded bargain phone. The Moto G is as simple as it gets. A front-facing camera allows you to video chat.. When you first pick up the Moto G, you'll notice that it feels more solid than most cheap phones. It's plastic, but it doesn't bend or feel like it's going to shatter if you drop it. It has a soft-touch backing that's actually quite a joy to hold, even if it doesn't scream "premium" like aluminum phones from HTC and Apple. And bucking the trend of smartphones that are obsessed with their waistlines, the Moto G has some thickness and a few curves to it—which is just more of the phone to hold onto.. Running the latest version of Android 4.4—and getting fast updates to boot—you'll never have to miss out on the latest Google's innovative OS has to offer. On top of that, an LTE radio (you can shave the price down to $179.99 if you go without it), Bluetooth 4, an 802.11n wireless card, and a standard microUSB port all work together to ensure you have the latest connectivity options. There's no NFC chip, but it's not a huge tradeoff considering the price you pay for the phone—it's like buying a new car for one third the cost and only sacrificing power windows.. Behind a layer of the newest Gorilla Glass is a capacitive touchscreen and a 720p LCD. Considering that the screen is only 4.5 inches, that's good for a pixel density of 330ppi—basically identical to the iPhone 5S and easily surpassing the arbitrary "Retina" standard.. The lean hardware under the hood may not be all that inspiring, but the situation is much better than it sounds. For example, the Snapdragon 400 processor and only 1GB of RAM seems very underpowered, but operation of the device is still snappy. Google's "Project Svelte" initiative cut the memory usage of most Android apps in 4.4 KitKat, meaning the G can get by with a relatively limited pool of RAM. Having only 8 to 16 gigabytes of internal storage also is a bit of a drag, but the 4G LTE variant of the Moto G has a microSD card slot, letting you add another 32 gigabytes of storage.. Because the version of Android on the Moto G is almost as pure as you can possibly get, there's a very uniform interface. Controls and navigation are very easy, and it takes only a little effort to find what you need—even if you get a little lost. Additionally, all Google services and just about every app on the Play Store will work on this phone, so if you're looking for a phone that'll work well enough and never leave you wanting, the Moto G's got you covered.. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below. It's not good for the price. The Moto G has the best battery life we've seen so far under extreme web browser load.. Now, not to temper all the excitement we just built in the intro, but the Moto G doesn't have that crazy of a spec sheet. But like an experienced thrift store shopper, Motorola knows where the value is. Though it doesn't really excel in any one area, this phone is much greater than the sum of its parts.. Once you power on the phone, you won't find any carrier or manufacturer pre-installed bloatware. No redundant apps, no annoying system apps that can't be uninstalled, no wasted space on the drive. Considering the aforementioned lack of expandable storage, this is a godsend. It's exactly why in some ways, even the lowly Moto E performs better than the Samsung Galaxy S5 .. Of course, when the G is given a single, processor-intensive task, it just doesn't keep up with flagship-level hardware. If you're playing high-end Android games or streaming video, the G may not cut it. However, when it comes to things like basic graphics, web browsing, and low-load operations, the G hangs tough. Though it may never compete with the Samsung Galaxy S5 or LG G3 in overall horsepower, the Moto G runs pretty smoothly during everyday operations.. And while the processor and screen on the Moto G aren't perfect, there's a benefit to that: battery life. The G's 2070mAh battery is non-removable, but it lasts just as long as the much larger batteries in the LG G3 and Galaxy S5. In our labs, it took over 5 and a half hours of extreme load to run down the battery—more than a full hour beyond the LG G3 and on par with the Galaxy S5.. And while the processor and screen on the Moto G aren't perfect, there's a benefit to that: battery life. A big part of that is the smaller screen, just 720p, but is actually a high-quality HD panel. Not only does it have a very accurate color gamut along the Rec. 709 standard—the international standard for HDTV color performance—but it also has a near-perfect transition from black to white (2.21 gamma). The LCD isn't quite as bright as the iPhones of the world, though, so visibility in direct sunlight isn't the best.. If there's a catch, photography is where you'll find it. Tapping the screen in the default camera app snaps a picture, not autofocus. Don't let its aesthetics fool you, this camera is very bad.. The point-and-shoot camera market has been imploding in the last couple years because, for day-to-day snapshots, most people just rely on their smartphones. Despite this fact, smartphone cameras are still pretty poor compared to even basic dedicated cameras. That's usually okay, though; what makes for a good Instagram shot can still look terrible on a 4x6 or 8x10 print.. Even the best smartphone cameras have wild color error, terrible sharpness, abysmal dynamic range. Unfortunately for the Moto G, it doesn't even do well by the low standard other smartphone cameras have set.. Reds are overblown, driving down color accuracy. For starters, a color error (∆C00 saturation-corrected) of 3.55 is far beyond what we'd consider acceptable for a dedicated camera. Reds are pushed too far, while yellows and greens just don't pop as much as you'd expect them to.. Though it's not the worst smartphone camera we've tested—that honor belongs to the Moto G's little brother, The Moto E —you can expect to see a certain fuzzy quality to your shots if you ever check them out at full magnification. Only being able to resolve an average of 952.9 lw/ph even in ideal conditions is terrible no matter how you slice it.. The Moto G's camera doesn't add in much noise, but that's largely due to a sinister tradeoff. Shots you take with the camera will lack noise because the camera's software automatically applies a heavy-handed noise reduction algorithm, killing fine detail in the process. Considering how fuzzy the camera's photos are to begin with, low light will ruin nearly shot you take.. All these problems and more combine to ensure especially low quality video. Whether it's in low light or bright light, your clips will look fuzzy and out of focus with loads of compression artifacts. In general, the Moto G's shots will look fine on Facebook or in a quick Vine, but if you are capturing a special moment we highly recommend you use a better camera.. Being cheap is no longer an excuse. Android can use any one of several keyboards with innovative input methods.. I've said it before, and it bears repeating: The Moto G is far more than the sum of its parts, and there's good reason that it's the most popular Motorola handset of all time. Not only does it hang tough with the rest of the market, but it doesn't load you up with junk you don't need. It's perfect for anyone who needs a good smartphone and might be a little hesitant to make a huge investment into a device they'll wind up replacing in a year anyway.. Because this phone is offered off-contract, the sticker price might sting a bit at first. However, it does unlock the world of pre-paid contracts—which will let you pay far less a month for the service you need. When you consider that you're not locked into a carrier, or even have to pay off the device—that $219 winds up being the smart money investment in a short time.. Taken at face value, this smartphone has an awesome screen, outstanding battery life, and a simple-as-you-like user experience. It's one of those phones that you'll look back to in five years and wonder why they aren't still being made. Sure, it's not the best device out there, but it runs like a dream and won't put you in the poor house. It might be an entry-level phone, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great device.. Taken at face value, this smartphone has an awesome screen, outstanding battery life, and a simple-as-you-like user experience. To be perfectly blunt, there isn't a better value on the market today. That might change with new phones being announced in the coming days, but that might drive down the price of the Moto G even more. For what you're getting, the Moto G's price is a paltry sum to pay. If you really only need a basic phone to check email and browse the web, you might find the Moto E to be a better value. But it comes at the tradeoff of a near-unusable camera, worse performance across the board, and only a savings of about $50.. Obviously, if you need to have the latest apps, NFC, or best camera—you don't want the Moto G. However the line that distinguishes good smartphones from entry-level ones is really not that definitive. A great smartphone will still have a crappy camera for the time being, and the importance of practical measures like battery life can't be oversold. By that token, the Moto G is an incredible phone, and the one to buy if you need a basic smartphone sidekick.. Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.

Moto E, Moto G 4G, Moto X to Receive Android 5.1 Lollipop Update Directly. Ketan Pratap , 03 April 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Motorola's first-generation Moto E, Moto G 4G, and Moto X will not receive the Android 5.0 Lollipop update, and will directly receive the Android 5.1 update.. The news was confirmed by Motorola's Senior Director of Software Product Management, David Schuster, who in a Google+ post stated reasons for the direct update to Android 5.1 Lollipop. Schuster claimed that Android 5.1 Lollipop came with a lot of improvements compared to Android 5.0 update leading the company to upgrade the three devices directly to Android 5.1 instead.. He said, "As some of you might know, we've been testing Lollipop 5.0.2 upgrades on Moto X (1st Gen) , Moto E (1st Gen) and Moto G with 4G LTE (1st Gen) in several regions. In parallel we have started testing Lollipop 5.1 which was recently released by Google. Given the improvements in Lollipop 5.1, we have decided to move all efforts to upgrade these devices directly from KitKat to Lollipop 5.1.". A report from February suggested that the Android 5.0 Lollipop soak test for the budget Moto E was in process. However, it turns out that the company has moved its efforts to Android 5.1 Lollipop update straight. Motorola in the past had also detailed how it was struggling with hardware issue on the first-generation Moto X as it is powered by the dated dual-core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor.. Motorola has been one of the brands that have rolled out Android 5.0 Lollipop updates to most of its recent devices, including the Moto G (Gen 1) , Moto G (Gen 2) , and Moto X (Gen 2). The Moto E (Gen 2) came with Android 5.0 Lollipop update out-of-the-box.. Motorola is also expected to roll out the Android 5.1 Lollipop update to its Moto X (Gen 2) soon, as tipped by the changelog on the company's website.. Some of the features of Android 5.1 Lollipop include support for multiple SIM cards, Device Protection and HD voice on compatible devices. Other changes include easy handling of Wi-Fi toggles and Bluetooth from Quick Settings; fix for random app crashes; improved security in case the smartphone has been stolen or is lost; improved heads-up notifications that let users swipe up to collapse; better handling of system audio while playing a media file, and new 'No interruptions until next alarm' option in Priority mode..

Others pointed out that Apple's comparable model costs much more for the same storage, which doesn't include an SD card slot. In other words, they're wondering how he can complain about the price on the Moto G LTE when his favorite company's comparable model is higher and doesn't allow for expandable storage.. posted on 16 Jun 2014, 19:27. is this better than the window phone on cricket.

Another common feature which runs through all three handsets is the rear facing camera, which is rated at 5MP on each.. The Moto G and G 4G benefit from a single LED flash on the rear to help in darker situations, while the Moto E misses out on this illumination option.. There's also the option to capture slow motion video and change the aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9 on the Moto G 4G and G - neither of which are available on the Moto E.. Round the front and the Moto E is lagging behind again with no front facing snapper on show.. The duo of Gs do rock front facing cameras, although they're only 1.3MP offerings so aren't exactly going to produce dazzling selfies.. With a smaller chassis and less demanding components it's no surprise the Moto E sports the smallest battery here with a non-removable 1980mAh power pack under the hood.. That said the battery inside the Moto G and G 4G isn't a that much bigger at 2070mAh, and it's also non-removable.. Motorola quotes up to 24 hours of life on a single charge with "mixed usage" for all three handsets - although that will vary depending on how much you like to hammer your phone.. There's a battery in there, but you can't get to it. As the name suggests the Motorola Moto G 4G comes with LTE capabilities allowing you to access faster network connections, if your tariff allows.. The original Moto G and Moto E both make do with 3G support, while all three boast Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS.. In terms of storage the G 4G and E have the upper hand as they have microSD slots hiding beneath the removable rear shell as well as 8GB of internal space. The Moto G is available in 8GB and 16GB variants, but with no expandable option.. Only one of the three offers 4G. The Moto E comes in cheapest here with a SIM-free price tag of £89, or £79 on PAYG.. The 8GB Moto G can be had for around £130 SIM-free, or if you fancy a PAYG deal it can be yours for around £100.. Topping the bill is the Moto G 4G at £149 off contract, but considering it's only a touch more than the original Moto G and has the benefits of 4G and a microSD slot it should be the G of choice if you can afford it.. The Moto E (left) and Moto G 4G (right). If you can stretch the extra mile we'd recommend the Moto G 4G out of the three devices here, but if you're looking for a cheap second phone - perhaps one to take to a festival - the Moto E fits the bill nicely.. There are other options on the market if these Motos don't take your fancy with the excellent Nokia Lumia 520 offering up a Windows Phone experience.. The likes of the Samsung Galaxy Fame , ZTE Blade V and Blade Q Mini are Android-toting rivals, but are overshadowed by Motorola's trio.. Prev Page Design, screen, power and OS.

Moto G 4G (2nd Gen) review. Motorola's budget barnstormer gets 4G and a bigger battery. We are part of The Trust Project. The Moto G is the phone that changed it all. arrived in 2013, it showed us that a brand-name handset costing around £140 could give you an Android experience not a million miles away from that of a £300-£500 flagship.. And now Motorola has tweaked the formula with a 5in screen and 4G.. It’s up to speed on hardware. The only worry now is that Android Lollipop actually leaves the phone feeling slower than the original did two years ago. Part of what makes the Motorola Moto G formula so appealing is its apparent lack of ego and 'look at me' posturing. You get simple, fuss-free software and a pretty straightforward design here.. It comes in black or white, and it’s low on flourishes and fancy bits. There’s just the Moto logo on the back, the silvery bars on the front, and the little characteristic dimple on the rear to mark this out as a Moto phone.. It walks the line between pleasantly plain and boring well, but if anything I prefer the even more vanilla first-gen Moto G; now that really was a fuss-free phone.. This newer design is larger too. While its 5in screen isn’t huge compared with many of 2015's smartphone behemoths, it’s thicker than most at 11mm. But palm-filler or not, it feels good regardless, as the rear is smooth and curvy and has a finger-charming soft-touch finish.. The build quality here is a cut above what you'd get on a lot of cheap phones too. While the back is covered by a plastic shell, the rest of the Moto G frame is a solid chunk of plastic. No creakiness here, and the screen is swathed in good old Gorilla Glass 3 too. Also unusual for a cheaper phone, the Moto G has stereo front speakers. Don’t go expecting HTC One M9 -grade audio goodness, as audio quality is still within the smartphone norm, but you do at least get respectable volume. It can spar with your kitchen extractor fan, and that's the modern benchmark to beat.. What really makes the Moto G stand out among budget rivals from the likes of Sony and Samsung, though, is its screen. As with previous models, you get 720p HD resolution. While not quite enough to get you absolutely pristine sharpness, it’s close enough that, 90% of the time, you won’t notice what slight pixellation there is.. Sure, I’d be complaining if this was a £300 phone, but given that it costs half that it's totally justified here.. It’s the same with the display’s colours. While you won’t get the deepest, richest colour palette as you would on a Sony Xperia Z3+, the colour tone looks natural and the slightly warm white balance is very easy on the eyes.. This is an IPS LCD screen, so you get pretty good viewing angles, and outdoors visibility is also fine. While plenty of other phones have taken the Moto G’s lead in offering a nice 720p screen - the. Microsoft Lumia 640 and Honor Holly among them - we’re not at a point where we can really expect much more for the cash.. Sure, the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 gets you a bigger 1080p for even less cash (£125), but it’s effectively subsidised by Vodafone, so it’s not really a fair comparison.. There’s just one area where the Moto G lets itself down. As with some other budget Android Lollipop phones, it’s slow at times. This was never an issue when the Moto G had Android KitKat, but it is one now.. As before, gaming is just fine on the phone, and nor should you have any problems when you’re midway through a single task. But moving between apps can cause issues: apps are often quite slow to load and even the homescreen can take a while to appear if you’ve been away for a bit. What do we mean by "quite slow"? Well it can take up to five seconds to load Chrome, for example. Who can we blame? Well, that Android 5.0 Lollipop is slower than 4.4 KitKat is no secret. It aims for a smooth feel rather than a snappy one.. However, a lot of this must be down to the way the Moto G handles its memory. It has 1GB RAM, which used to be virtually a guarantee of quick-fire performance. Motorola could theoretically fix this with a software update. And we hope it will, as the Moto G hasn’t always been like this. I’ve tested two Moto G handsets for this review, and both suffer from slow load speeds of certain apps, with the aforementioned Chrome and WhatsApp being two of the worst cases.. While Motorola is reportedly going to update the Moto G with a slightly faster processor soon , it really isn’t raw power that’s the issue here. While the 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 CPU isn’t a beast, it has enough number-crunching power to handle pretty sweet-looking games without working itself into a sweaty, red-faced mess.. It’s almost as though the Moto G is better at the hard stuff than the easy: this is a 5-star phone with some real 2-3 star performance issues. After a week or so with it, there were a good few times when the load lag really got me quite annoyed.. It's even more frustrating given that there's no software bloat to slow the Moto G down. Like its daddy, it uses a virtually untouched version of Android, with a few bonus apps and a Motorola camera program being the only serious changes.. The apps are good too - not the usual excuses to get you to spend more cash in naff third-party software stores. Motorola Migrate helps you move content from your old phone, Assist simplifies the setting up of features such as Do Not Disturb (which turns alerts off at certain times), and Alert is a handy phone-tracking app that is just the ticket if you want to get a phone for one of your kids. Or an other half you don’t trust at all.. With a pretty tasteful apps menu, the only junk on the Moto G will be what you put there yourself. And on that front, there's a decent amount of space to fill, with a fair bit more than 2GB of the initial 8GB storage to play with, plus a microSD slot under the back cover.. Downloading apps, streaming media and so on is snappy too, thanks to the 4G mobile internet. This is another thing the Moto G has added since 2013.. The 30 best games on Android right now. The other big improvement here is the camera. Where the very first Moto G had a pretty terrible 5MP rear effort, this 5in version has a much more impressive 8MP sensor.. Sure, plenty of cheap phones are starting to use 13MP cameras now, but with a bit of work you can squeeze some decent photos out of this one. It's built around the Sony IMX179 sensor used in the good old Nexus 5, plus an f/2.0 lens.. Decent sharpness means you can still get a fair bit of detail in good lighting, and with close-up shots you even get a bit of the arty shallow-depth-of-field look thanks to the wide aperture glass.. The HDR mode is pretty effective too, generally getting you a much more striking photo. They often won’t look 100% natural, but it’s better than having a weakling HDR mode.. While I think some of you may find the Motorola camera app a bit fiddly, with its rotary dial menu, it does have the handy Auto HDR function, letting it switch between HDR and non-HDR shooting as needed.. The Moto G camera is no smash, mind. the colours get a bit lifeless. And at the best of times they don’t have the subtlety of a high-end phone camera.. The Moto G will do the job for casual everyday shooting, though. It doesn’t suffer from any huge image quality-skewing issues that’ll consistently muck up your shots without being your fault on some level. Video tops out at 720p quality, but there’s slo-mo on offer too.. Oh, and you get a 2MP front camera.. As with the rear one, it’s nothing special but not disastrous either.. Tips and tricks for great smartphone photography. The non-4G Moto G got this camera setup when it switched to a 5in screen, something that happened quite a while ago. With that move came much worse battery life. But that has been fixed in this newer 4G version.. Inside there's now a 2390Ah battery instead of a 2070mAh one, and that's just. the thing to power a 5in, 720p screen phone .. In fact, it gets you enough stamina that you can be pretty relaxed about charging. You still have to be pretty frugal to get two whole days’ use out of the Moto G, but it won’t be dead by bedtime unless you use it an awful lot. I’ve found I can generally get to midday on day two without me being too careful. This is actually just as good a reason to get the 4G version as 4G itself is.. The 2015 Motorola Moto G 4G is a 5-star phone with a software problem. Most of what we’ve loved about the phone for the last two years is present and correct: good price, great screen and tasteful design mean it’s not going to offend anyone, anywhere with its design and specs.. However, performance is let down by app load lag that just was not an issue before the series made the leap to Android Lollipop. Will it be fixed one day? We hope so, but bear in mind you’ll need patience, either waiting for the upgrade or to deal with the load lag itself.. Aside from this, though, the Moto G is still a smash, if one that has plenty of competition. The Microsoft Lumia 640 offers a similar idea but with Windows Phone, while the Vodafone Smart Prime 6 is similar but way cheaper (but also locked to Vodafone).. Would we buy it? If we weren't on Vodafone and wanted Android, then yes. But we'd be happier once those software issues are sorted..

Motorola Moto G 4G turned out a great smartphone on its own and an excellent upgrade over the original Moto G. It adds 4G LTE connectivity, a microSD card slot, a brighter screen backlight and a gyro sensor to the already well proven hardware mix of the 4.5″ HD display, Snapdragon 400 chipset, 5MP camera and 2,070 mAh battery.. The new smartphone is running on the latest available Android 4.4.4 KitKat revision, but so is the Moto G already. We didn’t expect much of a difference in the battery performance, but we were wrong.. As it turns out the Moto G 4G battery life is better than its successor’s. The phone has a brand new modem, which should be one of the main reasons for the altered battery performance. Our lab tests also confirmed the display unit is slightly different from the screen in the original Moto G, which should impact the overall performance as well.. So, the Moto G 4G lasted 14 hours and 17 minutes on our 3G talk time test before its battery ran out of juice. This is half an hour better than Moto G’s endurance.. The web browsing performance is also better and among the best we’ve seen at 10 hours and 52 minutes. This is almost two hours more than the Moto G and a great achievement.. Moto G 4G lasted 7 and half hours on our looped video playback test – and above average endurance and 50 minutes better than the Moto G.. Finally, the Motorola Moto G 4G squeezed a few hours more than the Moto G on our standby test and thus its final endurance rating went up to 64 hours. This is 10 hours more than the Moto G and means the Moto G 4G will last for well over two full days if you do an hour each of calling, video watching and web browsing a day.. We should also probably give the Motorola Moto G 4G a few extra brownie points as well as it’s notably brighter than most of its competitors at the 50% setting, which we use for our battery test.

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. While many of the specs on the Moto G and Moto G 4G have exceeded its price, the camera is an area where Motorola has clearly tried to save some money.. On the rear of the handset you'll find a 5MP camera and single LED flash, while on the front you get a 1.3MP snapper.. Motorola has done some work in the camera app on the Moto G, providing a minimalist interface which sees all the settings hidden from view and the whole screen made into a shutter key.. Now I've bemoaned the use of the whole screen as the shutter on other handsets, as the fiddly little app icons could be easily missed, leading to me taking many unwanted snaps.. Luckily this issue has been overcome on the Motorola Moto G, as the settings wheel is accessed by sliding your finger from left to right over the display - not once did I accidentally take a picture when trying to tweak options.. That might be partly due to the fact I rarely found myself accessing settings, because it's seriously slim pickings.. For anyone looking to tinker with various modes, effects and advanced settings such as brightness and white balance the Moto G / Moto G 4G is not the cameraphone for you.. All you get are flash, HDR mode, shutter sound and aspect ratio toggles along with a Panorama mode, the ability to attach location information to your snaps and a rudimentary focus & exposure control.. If you have plumped for the Motorola Moto G 4G you do get an additional option in the menu wheel, allowing you to save snaps to the microSD card (if you have one inserted) rather than to the internal storage.. Shutter speed is pretty swift, but if you fancy a burst mode just hold down on the screen and the Moto G will snap away until you release your finger.. There's a 4x digital zoom to boot which is controlled by sliding your finger up and down the display - although picture quality takes a serious battering, so it's best avoided.. The full screen trigger makes snapping photos easy as you don't have to aim for a small shutter button on screen, although once you see the results you may wish you never bothered.. That budget price tag really rings true here, and I found the majority of my photos were a pixelated mess. The Motorola Moto G struggled to focus properly and even with the focus & exposure setting turned on things didn't improve.. The Moto G performed better close up, as it was obvious what to focus on - but when looking at landscapes and situations with a lot going on it just couldn't make up its mind.. It's a real shame that the Moto G doesn't have even a slightly better camera offering, but at its rock bottom price point a concession had to be made somewhere, and this is it..

Moto E (2015) vs Moto G 4G (2015): What’s the difference?. We compare this year’s brand new Moto E and Moto G 4G , two bargainous phones that now pack LTE support and some great features for a price you can’t argue with. Check out our full comparison review to see what the difference is and which is best for you…. The Moto E and Moto G enjoy similar chunky designs, but there are a few key differences. Most obvious is the size difference. The Moto G is a 5-inch palm-filler which can just about be used one-handed, while the Moto E is a dinky 4.5-incher that slips easily into pretty much any pocket and is a breeze to operate with just one mitt.. Both phones can be customised and personalised too, but in different ways. The Moto G 4G’s entire back plate lifts off and can be replaced with one of a number of bright and bold colours, to make it stand out in a crowd. However, the Moto E limits customisation to a removeable edge, which again can be replaced with something a bit more vibrant.. If you’re after a serious portable media machine, the Moto G 4G is your best bet. The screen is more spacious and. also sports a denser HD resolution (720p) so your movies look nice and crisp, while colours are a little more vibrant.. The new Moto E has a smaller 4.5-inch screen that misses the HD visuals of its bigger brother. However, although the panel isn’t as sharp or as colourful, it’s still bright and perfectly fine for everyday tasks.. The Moto G 4G has another advantage with its dual front-facing speakers, which pump out a surprisingly crisp and clear sound. The Moto E makes do with a mono speaker and it’s commendable for a budget offering, and thankfully also points at your face.. With the Moto G you also get marginally more storage (16GB as opposed to 8GB), but both phones pack microSD memory card slots so you can easily carry around a massive collection of music, movies or whatever.. Both phones pack non-removeable 2,390mAh batteries, which give respectably long life between charges. We found we managed a full day and a half of use with the Moto E before it died and we’re expecting the same result from the Moto G 4G.. You can also stream video for almost seven hours per charge, a result that’s happily above average.. The Moto G 4G packs the better camera tech, an 8-megapixel snapper that proves dependable in everyday situations. Photos are sharper than those taken on the Moto E, which lack detail and often have a ‘hazy’ quality out of natural light.. The Moto G also boasts an LED flash on the back, something lacking on the Moto E. So if you’re always snapping your mates in the club, the Moto G 4G is the handset to stump up for.. Still, both phones enjoy a simple camera interface which is basically tap-to-shoot. And you can load up the camera on both the Moto E and Moto G by flicking your wrist twice, even when the handsets are hibernating, which is a great way to quickly take a shot.. If you’re planning on watching a lot of movies on the go (a good reason to have that 4G), or taking a lot of snaps, then you might want to consider spending the extra £50 on the Moto G 4G. The spacious HD screen and 8-megapixel camera are the biggest upgrades over the Moto E, which is better suited to those after simple, compact handsets..

Mobile Phones Home Theatre Home Appliances Wearable Tech Networking Coffee machines. Review: Motorola Moto G 4G Leigh D. Stark 3 years ago Google Android , Mobile Phones Conclusion. Positive marks have to go to the battery, with the Moto G 4G able to pull an impressive two days from its 2070mAh battery.. That’s a result better than a lot of bigger handsets, and we were amazed by what the G 4G could do here.. Our test includes making phone calls, sending texts, surfing the web, social networking, taking photos, playing the odd game, listening to music, capturing photos, and generally using a phone, and that pulled two working days for us, or a little over 36 hours from a purely on-and-working runtime.. If you use your mobile a little more than we will, you’ll likely want to charge daily, but most people should see close to two days usage, which is relatively impressive given that this is a 4.5 inch smartphone that runs on 4G networks with 4G speeds.. Those 4G speeds were equally excellent, with download speeds ranging from 25Mbps to just shy of 61Mbps in our tests, which should be plenty fast for most people.. Even the performance isn’t bad, though it does have some niggles here and there.. From a technical standpoint, the Moto G is an improvement on the hundred dollar less Moto E, upping the chip from a dual-core Snapdragon 200 to a quad-core Snapdragon 400, but it’s not a huge shift that most will notice, and there’s still a degree of lag here and there, especially when you look at some of the 2013 phones that can be found at reduced prices that this competes against.. The software, though, is probably the best part of the performance package, because like other Motorola Android phones made in the past two years, this is pretty much pure Android the way Google wants it, with Motorola’s own stuff sitting on top.. This implementation means Motorola practically delivers the most up-to-date Android experience ever, and while some phones struggle with Android 4.3 “Jelly Bean” and others have Android 4.4.2 “KitKat” on them, this $299 Moto G 4G was running Android 4.4.4 a day into beginning our review tests.. Mostly, at least not the sort a general consumer will notice, but it shows you how on the ball a Motorola phone is, and if you’re at all concerned by the speed of updates from other manufacturers, those concerns can be allayed here on the $299 Moto G 4G, because the latest version of Android is what you’ll get. But not all is great, and we take particular aim at the camera, because that’s where the Moto G just doesn’t feel as solid an experience as the rest of the handset.. Granted, there’s a flash on the back, so that’s something, but the camera quality isn’t good, at least not on the usable level that it is on the Moto X.. Here, the images are soft, blotchy, and generally lacking in light balance unless HDR mode is switched on.. At least the interface makes the camera easy to use, with the same simple camera software from both the Moto E and Moto X gracing the Moto G 4G.. But seriously, we’d only rely on it for the bare basics, because really, the camera is one of the weakest we’ve seen on a camera edging this close to the $300 mark..

It’s not the cheapest Motorola out there, but in terms of performance, the Moto G 4G ticks quite a few boxes, offering a great screen, fast 4G speeds, and impressive battery life.. There’s some pretty solid competition between this and Kogan’s BenQ-powered Agora 4G , a device which has half an inch on the Moto G 4G, but if you like devices small-ish and want to move from the iPhone 3 or 4 to an Android with more bandwidth, this is one phone we’d check out..

PS Interestingly, Moto G 2nd generation does work on 850 but is not 4G. With Vodafone turning its 850 frequency over to 4G over the next year(?), doe this mean that the Moto G 2nd generation is not a good buy?. Write a Comment view all comments.
