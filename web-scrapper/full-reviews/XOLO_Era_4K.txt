Once you buy Xolo phone and needs any service, it would be worst nightmare for you.

Ali Pardiwala , 22 March 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Lava's Xolo was initially launched to serve a more premium audience, with Lava itself taking care of the budget market. It launched India's smartphone with an Intel SoC, the Xolo X900 , and has recently been in the news for diverse products such as the Xolo Black ( Review | Pictures ) and Xolo Chromebook , which offer decent quality at competitive prices. (Tap to see full-size image) (Tap to see full-size image) Xolo Era 4K in pictures. It's then surprising that Xolo is pushing into the budget segment with the Rs. This budget phone promises reliable performance and good battery life, thanks to its 4000mAh battery. We get into the details of the Xolo Era 4K in our review.. Look and feel When you're shopping for a smartphone in the budget segment, you can't have very high expectations for aesthetics and build quality, and plastic is pretty much all that you will get. The Xolo Era 4K is understandably plastic in terms of material quality, and feels like any other low-cost phone. It has a comfortable shape and size, but isn't as easy to grip as we'd like, because of the smooth texture and slight curve near the edges.. That said, it's still a simple looking phone and is easy on the eyes. It's available in two colours: white and blue. Although our white review sample looked decent enough, we feel that the blue variant exudes more sophistication and style. The sides are silver with a dull finish. While the power and volume keys are on the right edge, the 3.5mm socket is at the top and the Micro-USB port is at the bottom.. The front of the Era 4K is plain, with a 67.1 percent screen-to-body ratio. At the top are the front camera, earpiece and proximity sensor, while the chin is plain because of the use of on-screen Android buttons. The 5-inch HD IPS LCD display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and is just about satisfactory when it comes to brightness, colours and sharpness. Although it won't thrill you greatly, it's entirely acceptable in all ways for the price.. The back is plain, with only the Xolo logo, speaker grille, rear camera and flash visible. You can pop off the plastic panel to get to the Micro-SIM and microSD slots. Fortunately, there are three separate slots, so you can have two SIMs as well as expandable storage of up to 32GB. Both SIM slots support 4G connectivity, but only one can run on 4G networks at a time.. Specifications and software The Xolo Era 4K runs on the MediaTek MT6735P SoC, with its four CPU cores clocked at 1GHz. It's a chip that we're used to seeing on budget devices, and is known to offer decent entry-level performance. There's also 2GB of RAM, 4G connectivity on both TDD Band 40 and FDD Band 3, and 8GB of internal storage, of which only about 4GB is user-accessible.. Android 5.1 powers the phone, with the standard Google Now launcher. This will appeal to a lot of users, because of the simplicity and ease of use that Google's stock launcher offers. There are of course some minor changes in the settings and menus, but the system is essentially a near-stock version of Android Lollipop.. The Settings menu itself is simple, with no major additions apart from a 'Smart Features' tab which allows you to use the Air Shuffle and Smart Wake features. Air Shuffle lets users wave a hand over the proximity sensor to control navigation of the phone, while Smart Wake uses gestures to wake the phone and launch specific apps directly from sleep mode. While the latter works fine, the former barely ever worked for us and was far too unreliable to bother with.. The rest of the interface is simple, although unlike typical stock Android, there are far too many apps pre-installed on the phone. They include Amazon, Citrus Cube, Gameloft Game Hub, Clean Master, Hike, Hotstar, Office Suite, OLX, Opera Mini, PayTM, Saavn and Fame, which is a lot of add-ons that you may or may not want.. Fortunately, all of the apps can be uninstalled, which will also free up a bit of space. Wallpapers, widgets and launcher settings are easily accessed, and there is also a useful 'Super Power' mode which shuts down all but basic phone functionality to stretch battery life. On the whole, the phone is well equipped for beginners and experienced users alike.. Camera The Xolo Era 4K has an 8-megapixel primary camera with LED flash, and a 5-megapixel front camera. The rear camera records video at up to 720p, while the one in front can record video at up to 480p. A handful of picture modes are present, including multi-angle view, live photo, motion track and panorama. There is also an HDR mode, as well as a QR scanner built into the app itself.. The camera app appears a bit cluttered, but is easy to use. All functions are easy to reach, and recording video is a one-step procedure. The Settings menu gives you access to manual controls, self-timer, resolution settings and more, and interestingly, you also have the option to mute the audio while recording video, by disabling the microphone. The main screen lets you control the flash, switch cameras, toggle HDR, and choose quick-capture modes such as Smile and V-symbol. There's a lot you can do with this phone's cameras for the price, and that's a good thing.. Picturesare bright and colourful, but suffer when it comes to detail. Outdoor shots are incredibly vibrant for a phone in this price range, but zooming in reveals the stark lack of actual detail. Close-up shots also manage to reproduce colours admirably, but zooming in will reveal noise and fuzziness. The front camera is just about adequate for the occasional selfie, while low-light photography is best avoided altogether because of the lack of detail and tendency to get fuzzy.. Performance With its MT6735P SoC and 2GB of RAM, the Xolo Era 4K is equipped for acceptable entry-level performance. The software is efficient as well, and the system works well on the whole. Most apps and games work comfortably, although there is some delay when opening apps. Additionally, having too many apps open will slow the phone down and cause lag. If you keep things light and simple, the phone won't let you down when it comes to performance.. On running our standard benchmark tests, we found that the Xolo Era 4K is strikingly similar in performance to the Lava Pixel V2 ( Review ), with nearly identical scores. This isn't surprising, considering both phones are in the same price bracket and come from the same stable. The Era 4K returned scores of 8.6fps and 3708 in GFXBench's T-Rex On-Screen test and 3DMark Ice Storm respectively, and 24,199 and 8,990 in AnTuTu and Quadrant.. The phone comfortably held on to 3G and 4G signals, but was a bit weak in maintaining stable Wi-Fi connections during our time with the device. Call quality was decent, and the speaker, while a bit weak and soft, is acceptable for the price. Sound quality through earphones is decent as well. The phone ran for 12 hours, 55 minutes in our video loop test, which is among the highest times we've seen for a device in this price range. In ordinary use, the phone would last well over a full day. The bundled 10W charger is quick to top up the 4000mAh battery as well.. Verdict The Xolo Era 4K has a rather amusing name, since it doesn't have a 4K screen, isn't the fourth Xolo Era, and apart from having four cores in its SoC, we can't see that anything about it has to do with either a 4 or a K. That aside, the phone is an interesting option for buyers looking for a budget phone. 6,499 gets you an inoffensive looking smartphone with dual-SIM support, 4G capability on either SIM, expandable storage, and a near-stock version of Android. Performance is acceptable for the price, and above all, battery life is among the best we've seen in phone in this price segment.. There are some let-downs though, notably when it comes to camera quality, Wi-Fi stability and the fact that there is only 8GB of internal storage on the phone, which is on the low side today considering that many other similarly priced devices offer 16GB. However, if your needs are basic and you're looking for a phone that is easy and user-friendly, the Xolo Era 4K will suit you just fine..

Technology Tech Reviews Xolo Era 4K #ExpressReview: A great deal, if you really need that big. Xolo Era 4K review: The budget smartphone with a big battery option. Xolo Era 4K is compact smartphone that weighs 157 gms, the large battery notwithstanding. Sample shot for Xolo Era 4K. Sample shot for Xolo Era 4K.. Published: March 17, 2016 11:41 am. Internet speed far below what service providers claim:. Study Xolo launches three selfie smartphones in India: Era 3, Era 2V and Era. 3X Airtel tops 3G, 4G speed scores; Jio in 4G reach:. The Indian handset market is now flooded with smartphones that offer big batteries. The list includes smartphone makers like Gionee Marathon M5 with 6,020 mAh battery and M5 Lite with 4,000 mAh battery.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is another option that comes with a 4050 mAh battery.. Now Xolo Era 4K with its 4000 mAh battery joins the ranks and is definitely the cheapest entrants here.. Xolo Era 4K is compact smartphone that weighs 157 gms, the large battery notwithstanding. But is the big battery enough to make this one stand out? Here’s our review.. Specs: 5-inch HD IPS Display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 | 64-bit quad-core processor | 2 GB RAM | 8 GB storage (expandable via microSD to 32 GB) | 8 MP rear camera + 5 MP front camera (software enhanced) | 4,000 mAh battery| Android 5.1 Lollipop. Xolo has again managed to keep its smartphones stylish, and Era 4K is no exception. The camera unit and flash is neatly placed at the top left corner at the back. This one has a plastic back, rounded edges and a silver metal frame completes the look. Also, the smartphone is very compact. A 4,000 mAh battery is packed inside this phone, that weighs just 157 gms. It feels fairly light, both in your hands and pockets.. Xolo Era 4K has a crisp display and reproduces good colours. The icons are sharp, vibrant and make for great viewing angles. It doesn’t work quite well in sunlight. Since, this one comes with on-screen navigation buttons, the thick bezel at the bottom could have been avoided for a bigger screen size.. The battery in Xolo Era 4K will not disappoint you. It will easily last for more than 2 days of charging from moderate to heavy use. Even with the device 50 per cent charged, one can use the phone for a day and a half. And if the battery levels drop dangerously low,there’s a Super Power Mode that you can turn on to get more out of the device.. Xolo Era 4K packs a decent 8 megapixel rear shooter, giving average results in proper lighting. The auto-focus is fast, plus it comes with dual-flash, a live photo mode, panorama, face beautify etc. The front camera isn’t a disappointment either. Given the price point, one couldn’t really ask for more.. Multi-tasking during our review period on Xolo Era 4K wasn’t much of a problem either.. I did encounter some heating issues with Xolo Era 4K during my review. Just within few minutes of playing games like Asphalt-8 on it, the device started getting warmer.. Also, I did not like the quality of the touchscreen. It feels like you are pressing too hard on the screen to get things done and at times the display doesn’t respond at all.. Xolo Era 4K, at this price-point is a packaged deal. The 4,000 mAh battery will ensure that you never run out of juice, the device is compact, packs a decent camera. Xolo Era 4k could make for a good choice for those on a budget.. Intex Aqua Power HD comes closest to this price range with a 4,000 mAh battery at Rs 6,699. It features a 13 megapixel primary camera.. For all the latest Technology News , download Indian Express App. © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 8 GB + MicroSD. Low pixel density screen (294 ppi). The Xolo Era 4K is a mid-range smartphone with Android 5.1. Its specs include 5" 720p display, 1 GHz quad core CPU, 2 GB RAM, 8 GB ROM, microSD card slot, 8 MP rear camera and a 5 MP front one for video calls. Dual SIM card support is also present.. Dimensions: 5.63 x 2.83 x 0.36 inches (143 x 71.8 x 9.2 mm). Weight: 5.54 oz (157 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor, Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3). Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, CMOS image sensor. Software Features: Face detection, Smile detection, Voice activation, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Quad-core, 1000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 32.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min).

Xolo Era 4K Review, Price and Specifications. Xolo Era 4K packs a capacious 4000 mAh battery and comes with an affordable price tag of 6,499 INR. For now, the Xolo Era 4K will retail via flash sales exclusively on Gadget360, which means the Xolo Era 4K Price in India is expected to stay put in near future. Talking of Xolo Era 4K features and specifications, there is a 5-inch HD IPS display with Gorilla Glass 3 protection, below which hums a 1GHz Quad-core MediaTek MT6735P CPU, aided by 2GB RAM and 8GB internal storage. That's not a lot to begin with but to make ends meet, you can also plug-in up to 32GB MicroSD card. The 4000 mAh battery pushes the thickness to 9.2 mm, but the weight of 157 grams is still quite reasonable. Xolo claims that the battery will last for 32 hours of talk time, 624 hours of stand-by time. Xolo is using wide aperture lens on both rear and front camera. The 8MP rear snapper features dual LED flash support and F2.0 aperture 5P largan lens. On the front there is a 5MP selfie shooter with F2.2 aperture lens. Other features include 4G LTE / 3G, WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, Dual SIM and Android 5.1 Lollipop. The Xolo Era 4K covers all basic but doesn't bring anything refreshingly new to the table. If you are basic user jumping ship from feature phone to Android, Xolo Era 4K could be a worthy option..

I am using this phone since last one year and trust me it neither hanged ever nor the system crashed..... before this I was using mi4i which was for 12000 but I had to throw that phone coz many times my apps got crash even with good memory and ram availablity.....xolo phones are reliable and tough best part is battery supports me full day with continue internet.. Best part is battery and 4g enabled.. Worst part is memory only 4gb and week wifi.. But it is money worthy phone.. 5 out of 5 star. Was this review helpful? Yes No. Perfect phone with longer battery backup at affordable price. By Supam CB | 24 Nov 2016. The name Era 4K (4K is short code for 4,000) itself says that this device is packed with a powerful 4,000 mAh polymer battery, with excellent power back up. When fully charged it gives backup for whole the day, and even before sleeping you will find it remaining more than 25% battery after a normal usage. Beside, this model comes with 4G LTE support in both SIM slots, and 8MP rear - 5MP selfie front camera - which I think is enough for a regular smartphone user.. Even though it lacks VoLTE feature, however one XOLO official confirmed that this phone's software will be updated with VoLTE support in the following days to come and indeed good news for those who have it or are planning to come.. I was astonished to buy this phone with such a low price of Rs.5,999 with the availability of almost every feature in an Android smartphone.. Finally, I strongly recommend this phone to anyone who is planning to buy a 4G phone with a reasonable price.. Please buy it to use the features !!!. 5 out of 5 star. Was this review helpful?

I bought 3 phone for my dad,friend and relative.. Around 30 to 40 minutes is enough to full battery charging.. 5 out of 5 star. Was this review helpful? Yes No. K Verified Buyer. By KARTIK UMASANKAR | 21 Jul 2016. Good features at an affordable price of rs.6000 when compared to vivo at 12000 this is almost half the price with the same features.. vivo has just an additional feature of 16gb rom and otg drive.. but this xolo era 4k battery lasts for 3days in full gaming/4g browsing/videos etc.. There is always a power saver mode option. Instead of all other android phones, this phone has a novel software inbuilt which has many features like gesture, smart features, etc.. Mainly I choosed this xolo era 4k for gorilla glass, 4000mah battery, Good camera 8mp rear and 5mp front and branded. By cheap prices we go for Chinese scraps mobiles and that does not even lasts more than 6 months as the display gets broken and batter drains within half a day. So for 6000 the price is best and worth for this mobile. Lava sister concern is xolo so, I enquired authorized service center available before buying. But none of the stores has xolo so, its better to buy online. It was my first time to shop in gadgets360 and I got it in a good deal, very speedy service done by them and neatly packed. The only drawback is, the mobile is not supporting 8gb memory card but rest of the memory cards such like 32gb, 16gb, 2gb are being supported. No idea whats the problem is. I checked the same with my friend mobile too.. 5 out of 5 star. Was this review helpful? Yes No. P Verified Buyer. By Parveen Taj | 10 Jun 2016. 5 out of 5 star. Was this review helpful?

XOLO has come up with their new device, called the XOLO Era 4K, which is a budget oriented smartphone that is available for a price of just INR 6,499. This phone was launched on 15th February 2016, and we’ve got our hands on the device. Today, let’s do the unboxing and quick overview of the device in this article.. The XOLO Era 4K comes packed in a plain and simple white Box with XOLO branding on the top, along with the Era 4K Branding. Other than this branding, the top of the box is empty.. At the back of the box, you’ll find a picture of the device itself along with the key specifications of the device listed there. The back of the box is filled with information that you may need about the device at any given point in time.. Upon opening the box, you find the phone sitting on the top in all its glory, and after removing the phone from the box, you get access to the accessories compartment. So, let’s get into the accessories and the items that come in the box.. In the box for the XOLO Era 4K, you find a quick start guide, a warranty information booklet, a wall charger, a microUSB cable for charging and data sync, a pair of headphones, and a screen protector to put on the display of your device. It is good of XOLO to include the headphones and the screen protector inside the box itself because at times people have to hunt shops to find a screen protector for their smartphone.. The device sports a plastic build overall, featuring a metallic rim on the edges. On the front of the device, you’ll find the 5-inch HD screen with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. Above the display, you’ll find the 5-megapixel front facing camera and the earpiece.. On the back of the device, you’ll find the removable back cover. Other than that, you’ll also find the 8-megapixel rear facing camera with dual LED flash. At the bottom on the back, you’ll find the speakers for the phone.. On the top edge of the phone, you’ll find the 3.5mm headphone jack and the secondary microphone for noise cancellation.. On the bottom of the phone, you’ll find the microUSB port for charging and data sync and the primary microphone for use during videos or calls.. On the right edge of the phone, you’ll find the volume rocker at the top and just below that you’ll find the power button to power on and off the device.. The XOLO Era 4K comes packed with a MediaTek processor clocked at 1GHz, coupled with 2GB of RAM. On the storage side of things, the phone has 8GB of internal storage, though out of this 8GB, only about 2.6GB of storage is available for the user to use. The battery on the XOLO Era 4K is a massive 4000mAh, but before making any claims about the phone, I will have to test the phone for a longer period of time.. For gaming, I installed Dead Trigger 2 and Modern Combat 5 on the smartphone and played both of them. The phone did not lag when playing Dead Trigger 2 as such, gameplay was smooth but I noticed that the touch response was struggling a bit in the middle. I switched to Modern Combat 5 and played it for almost half an hour, surprisingly there was no lag but the game felt very slow from the very beginning and I was not able to point the aim with ease. Gaming on this device is good for mediocre level games.. The XOLO Era 4K is powered by MediaTek MT6735P, a 1GHz quad-core CPU coupled with 2GB of RAM. While testing out the benchmark scores, I did not expect much from the device, but still the device manages to score some decent specs for the priceat which the phone is offered.. The XOLO Era 4K is definitely a decent phone for the price at which it is offered, but there are powerful phones in the market that are priced similar to this phone. Overall, by the first impressions, the phone looks decent and the performance is also good for the price. I’ll try and use the device for a longer period of time and then decide how the phone is. Stay tuned to the blog to know more about the XOLO Era 4K and the other devices that will launch in the future..

Is the smartphone worth the price? Let is find out in the complete review.. The phone has a 5-inch display with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels and a pixel density of about 294 ppi (pixels per inch). The display brightness could have been better, since it seems dull even when the brightness is set to 50%. It has decent viewing angles and the sunlight legibility is decent as well. It also has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. Black border around the display makes the white colored phone look weird. Overall the display is just average for a phone with a HD screen.. There is a 5-megapixel camera on the front with f/2.2 aperture, along with the usual set of proximity and ambient light sensors, next to the earpiece. The front camera is good for selfies and video chats. There is also a tiny notification LED that glows in Red, Blue and Green colors.. Even though the phone has on-screen buttons, there is a huge bezel below the display. The phone is 143mm, slightly taller than some smartphones with a 5-inch screen. It is 71.8mm wide so that you can hold it comfortably.. The phone has brushed metal finish. on the sides and is 9.2mm thick. The power button and the volume rockers are present on the right side.. On the back there is a 8-megapixel camera with dual LED flash. There is a Xolo branding below the camera and the loudspeaker grill is present on the bottom part of the phone. The plastic back doesn’t attract fingerprints, but it is prone to scratches when placed on a rough surface and also gathers dust easily.. Opening the back cover reveals two micro SIM slots and a microSD card slot.. It also has a huge 4000mAh battery that occupies most part of the back. The phone is bit heavy at 157 grams, mainly due to the huge battery. Even though the design of the smartphone is not impressive, the build quality of the smartphone is good for the price.. Coming to the camera, the 8-megapixel rear camera with dual LED Flash and f/2.0 aperture is average. It has the usual MediaTek camera UI with several modes and also has a built-in QR code reader. Daylight shots are decent, but it doesn’t focus properly. Macro shots came out well, thanks to the f/2.0 aperture. HDR shots are just average, and comes out blurry even if there is a slight shake. Low-light images have a lot of noise and images with flash are not overpowering even when shooting close-ups.. Check out some camera samples below (click the image to view full resolution sample). It can record videos only at 720p resolution at 30fps, mainly due to the processor restriction. Video quality is just average and doesn’t have much details. Videos are saved in .3gp format and not .mp4. Audio is not crisp since is lacks a secondary microphone. Check out the HD video sample.. Coming to the software, it runs on Android 5.1 (Lollipop), which is almost stock with few visual changes. The company did not reveal any details about Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) update for the smartphone. Google Now launcher is the default launcher. You can launch the dialer or camera directly from the lock screen. There are two additional Air Shuffle and Gesture toggles in the Quick Settings menu.. The Air Shuffle feature uses the phone’s proximity sensor so that you can. change music or FM stations, View gallery images, capture images using camera, silence alarm and also mute an incoming call, without touching the phone. The Gesture option has double tap to wake up and also lets you draw letters on the lockscreen to launch apps directly, even when the screen is off.. Out of 2GB of RAM, you get 1.92GB MB of usable RAM. About 1.4GB of RAM is free when the phone is idle, with just the default apps running in the background. Out of 8GB of internal storage you get just 2.95GB of usable storage that can be used for installing apps and for mass storage. Once you set the preferred install location to SD card, you get option to move apps to the SD card. Even though it has an option to move apps to the SD card, about 3GB of storage is very less.. The phone comes with a lot of pre-loaded apps, but these can be uninstalled manually. Other than the usual set of utility apps and Google apps, it comes with fame, Amazon Shopping, Citrus Cube, Game HUB, hike, hotstar, OfficeSuite, OLX, Opera Mini, Paytm and Saavn.. It has the default Android music player that can play different audio formats and the phone has FM Radio with auto search and recording. Audio through the bundled headset is decent and audio through the loudspeaker is average. The default video player can play videos at full HD 1080p resolution smoothly.. It has the usual set of connectivity features such as WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS. It has 4G connectivity with support for TD-LTE 2300MHz (Band 40) and FDD-LTE 1800MHz (Band 3) for India. Both the SIMs support 4G, but you can enable 4G only in one SIM at a time, while the other goes to 2G. We did not face any call drops or any other calling issues. It also has USB on-the-go (OTG) support so that you can connect OTG drives easily.. Coming to the performance, the smartphone has MediaTek MT6735P 64-bit SoC with four ARM Cortex-A53 CPUs each clocked at 988 GHz per core. The performance is good and there are no lags. 2GB of RAM is enough to run several apps in the background. It doesn’t have any heating issues even when using 4G or during intensive gaming. Check out some synthetic benchmark scores below.. It managed to score 20462 points in the AnTuTu Benchmark 5 test.. It scored 906 points in the Vellamo 3.1 Metal CPU subsystem performance test and grabbed the third spot.. It managed to score 3018 points in the 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited GPU benchmark. Check out the complete set of Xolo Era 4k benchmarks here .. The gaming performance is not the best and has average graphics. Some games didn’t perform well and did lag.. The 4000mAh battery offers brilliant battery life. It lasts for 2 days with average use and a whole day even with heavy use. It has standby intelligent power saving mode that lets you save the battery by reducing the device’s performance when the phone is not in use.. It achieved One Charge rating of 14 hours and 37 minutes, which is good for a smartphone with a 4000mAh battery. Check out the complete set of Xolo Era 4K battery test results here .. At a price tag of Rs. 6,499, Xolo Era 4K is a decent 4K smartphone, but it still faces a tough competition from Yu Yuphoria , Lenovo Vibe P1m and others that are in the similar price range. Even though the performance is good and it has 2GB of RAM, the gaming performance is average and the camera is also average. It has a lot of pre-loaded apps. Even though these apps can be uninstalled manually, user storage of just 3GB is less for an Android smartphone.. The smartphone was available only through flash sale initially, now it is available through open sale on Gadgets 360. To summarize, here are the pros and cons of the smartphone..
