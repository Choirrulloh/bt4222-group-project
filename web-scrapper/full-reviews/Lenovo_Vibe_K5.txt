Please ask the question in above box. How is the processor performance of this phone?. It's very good phone till you do not store movies and much data. The camera is not good at night and during daytime its average.. If your phone's internal memory is free, then it works very nice. Even, you can play high definition games.. Excellent performance, still now there are no problems.. The performance is nice, and the gaming is also good.. Speed is excellent, it has a good performance.. How is the software updates of this phone?. The bad system in this phone is to update software. Lenovo product is waste, its screen and battery have a lot of problems.. No new updates are available but had an update for VoLTE.. The software is limited to 5.1 and not upgradable.. How is the battery radiation level of this phone?. But I have 3 Lenovo mobiles, and already two mobiles have gone bad. One with display issue & another one has a software problem. So, don't buy Lenovo mobile better buy Samsung, Mi & LYF.. This is worst phone according to me as it created the health hazard and I went on serious illness due to the heat generated. Finally, I returned to Amazon within a month time.. This is an outdated phone with outdated software & hardware. It gets heated up on using while charging, for rest of time it is cool.. Lenovo has improved its battery radiation level than before. Now for this mobile, it is better, not excellent, but it suits well.. The battery was getting dried soon if we use internet for more than one hour.. Does it support dual sim and a memory card?. Yes, it supports dual SIM and there is a separate memory card slot. It is a 4G phone, VoLTE enabled and it is also HD capable. Means you can make calls when Wi-Fi is enabled and can use phone dialer of the phone itself. Go ahead it is a good phone.. It absolutely supports & is excellent mobile. I am using this from 1 year. Yes, it has dual sim slot and memory card slot separately.. Yes, it supports dual SIM and memory card upto 32 GB.. Yes, it supports dual sim card but one memory card.. Why this phone is not upgradable?. You can check your device setting, search about phone, check updates and upgrade your device there after you can see in notification bar that. Now you can enjoy VoLTE 4G calling without any data connection.. Once you go to settings in the bottom, choose option About phone and go to the software update. You will receive an automatic update, then you can download it.. It's the company's decision, so it's not worth talking about it. Even, I wanted to upgrade this phone but I couldn't.. I have wasted my money and time buying this version and at last sold it as second hand.. This is not capable like that of other higher series of Lenovo mobiles..

Frequent problem while accessing shortcut option to switch on mobile data. Ajay, 14 Oct 2017 Worst phone in my life battery is draining like hell without any use it's gone discharge in ju... more Wat to do if battery is drained in 3 hour itself?. If u just need smartphone for social media and chatting im reccomended this phone because its battery isvery good. If u need smartphone for gaming dont buy this one, this smartphone's specification is looked high but very suck for gaming.. I tried to play some of my favorite moba games like heroes evolved, arena of valor, and mobile legend but this smartphone get very laggy and overheating even though i tried on another phone with lower specification its run very smoothly... The best thing that I love about Lenovo devices is that they come with pre-installed Dolby Atmos. Hopefully, I have also installed it on my Nokia 6. Thanks to this guide https://techonation.com/install-dolby-atmos-on-a­ndroid-without-root/. No the above option backlist is not available in my lenovo k5 vibe. It shame on this no blocking feature at all. From some day I m getting spam calls but unfortunately this specific phone don't have this main feature. Soon will change this phone to some other brand. well i really loved this phone such good capacity for game/music fans also good ram i rarly get lag only one thing it takes more than normal time for full charge.. The hardware is okay for its price. Yes, overheating, at times, depending on usage. And H O R R I B L E software. I had to do lots and lots of adjustments on this thing. Piece of advice, if you're a Samsung user (KitKat OS or higher) and planning to grab this one, you will have a hard time getting used to this.. It's good phone for its price, I'm using it for 1 year and no problem. For me one thing that could be better is link speed between phone and router, no matter what type or brand router is, max link speed is 72 Mbit/s, and on that link speed real max download is about 50Mbit/s in ideal condition..

For shutterbugs, Lenovo has placed a 13-megapixel primary camera module with an LED flash whereas on the front, it has fitted a 5-megapixel selfie camera. The phone is supported by Dolby Atmos and comes with a dual stereo speaker at the back. There is still uncertainty over the Lenovo Vibe K5 price in India. Lenovo has priced Vibe K5 at $149 for the US customers. We expect the online price of Lenovo Vibe K5 in India to be somewhere around 9,800 INR. Stay tuned for more update on Lenovo Vibe K5.. Aluminum Finish Dual Speakers with Dolby Atmos Decent camera hardware. No Fingerprint sensor No Gorilla Glass protection. The Lenovo Vibe K5 is an entry level phone, but you can't tell by just looking at it or holding it in hand. Part of the reason is the metal back, which adds an unexpected touch of premium. The K5's rear panel isn't entirely metal, there are two plastic bits top and bottom. The plastic bits get cutouts for the camera lens and flash in the top one, and the speakers in the bottom. There are in fact too speakers, which is another surprising feature in a smartphone this inexpensive, when even many flagships still make do with just one.. Noise cancellation Rear-firing stereo speakers FM radio. Limited regional availability, vastly different pricing in different parts of the world No Marshmallow Effectively 48GB of maximum storage. Overal mobile is good looking,but 6 months after display has bubbles are came toch is not working. Speaker sound is very very good Looking good. Camera Display Battery Heating Don't chose this phone.

Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed.

Reviews for the Lenovo Vibe K5 Foreign Reviews Comment Qualcomm Adreno 405 : Integrated graphics card for ARM based SoCs.

Only some 3D games with very low demands are playable with these cards.. » Further information can be found in our Comparison of Mobile Graphics Cards and the corresponding Benchmark List. 415 MSM8929 : Mid-range ARM-SoC with 8 CPU cores (64-Bit Cortex-A53 with up to 1.4 GHz)» Further information can be found in our Comparison of Mobile Processsors. 5" : » To find out how fine a display is, see our DPI List. Lenovo : Lenovo ( "Le" as in the English word legend and "novo" (Latin) for new) was founded in 1984 as a Chinese computer trading company. From 2004, the company has been the largest laptop manufacturer in China and got the fourth largest manufacturer worldwide after the acquisition of IBM's PC division in 2005. In addition to desktops and notebooks, the company also produces monitors, projectors, servers, etc.. 70.75% : This rating is bad.

Hands on: Lenovo K5 review Source: Techradar Lenovo finds itself in a tricky position. Sure the K5 is a decent budget handset, but it's not a brand name people in the UK associate with mobiles. It's likely to be overlooked as people's eyes land on more familiar territory. Motorola and Samsung are safer bets. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 12/20/2016. 72% Lenovo Vibe K5 Review Source: Think Digit The Lenovo Vibe K5 is fairly impressive in terms of the camera it provides and the performance, and even presents decent battery life. The Xiaomi Redmi 3s Prime is admittedly better, but the Vibe K5 is fairly recommendable, too. Single Review, online available, Short, Date: 09/05/2016 Rating: Total score : 72%. Lenovo Vibe K5 review Source: GSM Arena It means a removable battery, two SIM compartments and another dedicated microSD slot, all of those underneath a removable metal back cover. A pair of booming stereo speakers is another area where the K5 delivers above its pay grade.. The K5 is about as dependable a photographic tool as you could expect for the money - good output when the light is right, less so in dim scenes. Video hasn't been fixed from when we reviewed the K5 Plus and its erratic focusing renders it unusable at times. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 08/10/2016. 70% Lenovo Vibe K5 Review Source: NDTV Gadgets You definitely don't get what you don't pay for, which in this case is performance. Of course you can buy a better product if you can spend even just a little more, but clearly Lenovo has identified a target audience and it's nice for everyone to have this option. The Vibe K5 makes sense if you're on a water-tight budget.

Lenovo K5 Source: Tech Smart Getting your hands on an entry-level device that sports the screen, camera, battery and price tag of the Lenovo K5 is a rarity. Add to that, the device is solidly constructed, equally good at multitasking, and looks a little different from your run of the mill Android smartphone. Single Review, online available, Very Short, Date: 07/27/2016. Affordable smartphone with metal design Source: Laptop Media All things considered, Lenovo Vibe K5 is a more affordable phone than its Plus version. At first sight you may notice several noteworthy differences but they arenât that significant. Perhaps most users will not notice the difference in screen resolution â HD in the affordable version, and Full HD in the Plus smartphone. In both cases you have a 5-inch screen and an image that is detailed enough. This combined with an IPS panel can make one more than happy. The same goes for the mobile CPU which is also different but our tests proved that there is no significant variation in performance and exterior temperatures. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 07/03/2016. Lenovo K5 Source: Trusted Reviews The Lenovo K5 isn't really a phone to get excited about, but it's a solid lower-end device that I'm sure will get the job done. I'd recommend saving up a bit more cash and plumping for the Moto G, but that's not taking anything away from the K5.. It's more important as a signal of intent from Lenovo which has, until now, had little presence in the UK phone market. Will this lead to a more high-powered device? I'd like to think so.

Lenovo Vibe K5 and Vibe K5 Plus Hands on Source: Android Authority At MWC 2016 we had the opportunity to go hands on with the Vibe K5 and Vibe K5 Plus, two new entry-level handsets from Lenovo, which were formally announced by Lenovo over the weekend. Priced under $200, what do Lenovoâs latest budget-friendly handsets bring to the tablet? Letâs take a quick look. Comparison, online available, Very Short, Date: 02/23/2016. Lenovo Vibe K5 and Vibe K5 Plus hands-on Source: GSM Arena Thankfully, we took note and returned to Lenovo's booth for some hands-on time with the units. First things first - a quick specs rundown. Both models have a 5-inch display the difference being in the resolution - 720p for the basic one and 1080p for the Plus. Both LCD panels look perfectly adequate, although not exceptional in any way. Sharpness and colors seem good, but glare is perhaps a bit too much for our taste. Still, it might be the show floor lighting and we won't rush to any judgment.

Jamshed Avari , 26 July 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Lenovo Vibe K5 is a more affordable version of the Vibe K5 Plus. It has a slower processor and lower-resolution screen. The camera and battery life are highlights of the Vibe K5. (Tap to see full size Lenovo Vibe K5 samples). Lenovo's popular low-cost K-series has had a bit of an identity crisis over the past year. The popular low-cost K3 Note was succeeded by the Vibe K4 Note ( Review ), which didn't really fit into the same category, and then by the Vibe K5 Plus ( Review ), which was more of a return to K-series roots. 8,500 , the Vibe K5 Plus actually addresses a lower-cost section of the market than the Vibe K4 Note, and is a viable competitor to similarly priced devices from Xiaomi , Asus , Coolpad , Honor, and others.. Now, Lenovo has decided to introduce two K5 variants in India; the premium K5 Note, and the budget Vibe K5. The former gains the familiar 'Note' suffix, it looks like it's going to be a higher-end all-metal device when it launches. On the other hand, the Vibe K5 is a stripped-down, low-cost phone designed to appeal to those on a tight budget, and this is the device we're taking a closer look at today.. Look and feel The new Vibe K5 looks pretty much identical to its sibling, the K5 Plus. It has exactly the same style and is available in the same three colours: silver, gold, and grey. We don't mind this at all because we were quite happy with this design the first time we encountered it. It isn't the slickest phone around, but it definitely doesn't look low-end.. The body is all plastic, except for a thin plate of metal in the middle of the rear. This helps the phone feel sturdy, for what it's worth. A shiny chrome ring runs around the front and protects the screen from scratches when the phone is placed face-down on a table. We're a little concerned that the finish will wear off, especially at the corners and edges, but a simple case will help it stay looking fresh.. Grip is pretty good, and one-handed usage is easy. The Vibe K5 is light with gently curved edges on the back. Sadly, the three Android navigation buttons below the screen are not backlit. The Micro-USB and 3.5mm ports are on the top, and the power and volume buttons are on the right. A status LED lights up in the upper right corner of the front when you have a notification.. In addition to the primary camera and flash, you'll see twin speaker grilles and a Dolby logo on the back. Unlike other phones which have symmetrical grilles for looks alone, the Vibe K5 actually does have stereo speakers, which is interesting for this price segment. The rear and sides are a single shell which comes off entirely, and you'll see a removable battery, two Micro-SIM slots and a microSD card slot underneath.. Specifications and software The Qualcomm Snapdragon 415 SoC is quite a step down from the Snapdragon 616 in the Vibe K5 Plus. The screen resolution is also a step down, from 1080p to 720p. However, most other things are exactly the same across both models. There's still 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage plus microSD card support. You get 4G support on either SIM, plus Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1. The rear camera resolution is 13 megapixels and the front camera can take 5-megapixel shots.. The battery has the same 2750mAh capacity and it should actually last a bit longer on this phone thanks to the less demanding screen and processor. We pointed out in our review of the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus that it lacked things that some of its competition offers such as a fingerprint sensor or an Infrared emitter, and while this model doesn't have them either, it isn't as big a deal considering the price difference.. You get Android 5.1.1 running a custom skin by Lenovo called VibeUI, which isn't very different from stock Android. It's neat and clean with everything where you'd expect it to be. We noted with the Vibe K5 Plus that there was no dedicated app drawer, but this phone does have one. It's possible that Lenovo added this functionality in an update due to feedback.. Just like with the Vibe K5 Plus, the capacitive Recents button on the front panel has actually been mapped to the deprecated Android menu function, which is only relevant on Lenovo's custom homescreen now and serves no other purpose. You have to long-press this button to see the app switcher.. Pre-loaded apps include Amazon, Evernote, GameStore, McAfee Security, Route 66 maps, Tap the Frog, Truecaller, Twitter, UC Browser, and WeChat, which are probably useful but uninstallable if you prefer. There's also Lenovo's SHAREit, a Dolby control app, Lenovo Companion for updates and diagnostics, and Theme Center for customising your phone's looks.. Performance While probably good enough for most people's casual usage, we found the Vibe K5 just a bit sluggish. There were momentary delays when launching apps, pulling up menus, and just generally getting things done. The display has poor viewing angles, taking on a definite tint when you aren't looking at it head-on. Brightness and colours are okay, and you won't find any fault with the 720x1280 resolution at this screen size. The rear-firing speakers can get really loud. While distortion isn't too bad, the overall quality is just about bearable for casual listening.. This is the first phone in a long time on which our high-definition video sample files did not play smoothly - in fact even a standard-def AVI file started dragging, leaving audio and video out of sync. We tried a few 3D games including Asphalt 8 and found performance to be okay, but not great. Thankfully, at least the Vibe K5 didn't get too hot in use.. We wouldn't push this phone beyond light social networking and a bit of Web surfing though. It's clear that this model exists for a reason, which is to serve basic purposes for entry-level users, for whom even the Vibe K5 Plus might be too expensive. There is no other reason to choose this phone over its relatively beefy sibling.. In terms of benchmarks we got 28,759 points in AnTuTu, 16,162 overall in Quadrant, 4,741 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme, and 19fps in GFXBench. These scores are roughly what we'd have expected from mainstream phones a year or two ago, and so they indicate that the phone is perfectly functional but not exciting in any way. Don't expect to run games or apps that push it too hard, either now or in the future.. The rear camera is actually not bad, if you're willing to take shots slow and steady. Focus locking isn't instantaneous but at least it's reliable. Details on plants and metallic objects alike came out looking quite nice, even in overcast outdoor conditions. We even managed to get some excellent depth-of-field effects. The main problem was objects in motion, such as cars. Nighttime shots depended heavily on the amount of light around us. This camera definitely can't pick out the same level of detail in the dark that more expensive ones can, but even a streetlamp should cast enough light for a usable shot. Videos came out alright, and selfies with the front camera are also decent enough.. Finally, battery life was a pleasant surprise, at 8 hours, 33 minutes. This isn't spectacular, but it reflects the low-power screen and processor in the phone. We were able to get through a day and a half without needing to recharge, but that was without playing games or watching videos.. Verdict You definitely don't get what you don't pay for, which in this case is performance. Of course you can buy a better product if you can spend even just a little more, but clearly Lenovo has identified a target audience and it's nice for everyone to have this option. The Vibe K5 makes sense if you're on a water-tight budget.. Thankfully, there's a lot to like about the Vibe K5. Despite its general slowness, this phone covers all the basics and is perfectly usable. The software is sensible for the most part, battery life is decent, and camera quality is impressive. There are no glaring flaws or compromises that you'd have to live with. Plus, it actually looks quite good and won't make you feel like you had to settle for less than you wanted..
