Sammy give such a weak perform.... And your point is....? You're basically repeating what I had just said, which is that people in low socioeconomic class can only afford wired headphones, hence why budget/mid-tier models always retain the headphone jack. That was my point all along. The pixel upscaling algorithm would naturally slow down the processor and GPU which would obviously result in poor performance of the device in games and video playback..

Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro – a resounding success in India. 0 386 1 minute read. Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn StumbleUpon Tumblr Pinterest Reddit VKontakte Odnoklassniki Pocket. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro joins the sales record. There are already new sales scheduled. Just a week ago, Xiaomi announced the launch of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (and its standard version) in India. Today was the first flash sale of the device, and as with the Xiaomi Mi TV 4 , the success of the Smartphone was unexpected. Xiaomi did expect some degree of success, but they did not plan on requiring so many units.. According to the latest reports from Xiaomi India , the 300,000 units set for the flash sale of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro would have been sold out in less than 3 minutes. However, consumers do not think so, who soon showed their discontent on Twitter as soon as the event was published, and is that many users claim that the stock of the Smartphone did not take even 10 seconds to disappear from stores, which caused the cancellation of many of the purchase orders.. This sales event was called by Xiaomi India as “the biggest sale in the history of smartphones”. A Twitter user was not so in agreement, responding with “stop fooling us” and later he explains that the shopping site became inaccessible in just a few seconds, attributing this to the limited availability of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro.. @yuvaraj3003 , a fan of Xiaomi who joined the nonconformity indicated that the sign “out of order” appeared in just 10 seconds .. The good news is that Xiaomi India has already scheduled new flash sales for the Redmi Note 5 Pro on the page mi.com and in the Flipkart stores for February 28.. We must remember that the success of this Smartphone is due to all the features it includes, among which we can highlight an elegant design with fingerprint scanner, 4 colors to choose from, a Snapdragon 636 eight-core processor, a dual camera configuration of 12MP + 5MP, a front camera of 20MP, a battery of 4000mAh, and two variants of RAM, one with 4GB (at a price of INR13,999 – $215 / €175) and another with 6GB (at a cost of INR16,999 – $261 / €212) .. 5 note Pro record Redmi Xiaomi.

Review Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Review: A big step up. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Review: A big step up. The affordable champion from Xiaomi now comes in two variants, with the Redmi Note 5 Pro offering power users serious value.. Published: February 14, 2018 1:06 PM IST. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Design. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Specifications and Software. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Performance and Battery Life. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Camera. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is priced at Rs 13,999 onwards.. The smartphone is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 SoC and sports up to 6GB of RAM.. You also get a dual-camera setup at the rear and a 20-megapixel front camera.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is undoubtedly a fantastic smartphone. It isn’t because the phone is special in any way; nothing about the Redmi Note 4 truly stands out and there are no trademark features. The reason for my calling it a fantastic smartphone and our rating it a strong 4.5 out of 5 is because at its price, it was the most complete smartphone you could buy when it launched back in early 2017. It’s why the phone sold in such huge numbers in 2017 and continues to sell till today.. Now, while the actual successor to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is the Redmi Note 5, that phone is a bit simpler in its approach and is positioned at a different set of users. There isn’t much different on that device, apart from a couple of key changes aimed at making it a better value-for-money proposition. The truly exciting launch from the Chinese smartphone maverick today is the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro.. Priced at Rs 13,999 onwards, the Redmi Note 5 Pro isn’t just an incremental update. The changes in this device are radical and hope to redefine the price segment and what it has to offer. From a new SoC to a dual-camera setup geared less for gimmicks and more for better pictures, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is a first shot fired from a charged-up Xiaomi that has just taken a leadership position in India. We’re excited to bring you our review of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and Redmi Note 5 aren’t very different looking, and indeed the only significant difference between the two is the larger screen on the newer device. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is practically the same size as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and almost looks similar, but there are some minor differences. The plastic antenna strips at the top and bottom are narrower, the 3.5mm jack is at the bottom, the front camera is to the left of the earpiece, and the dual-camera setup at the rear is vertically positioned in the top-left corner. These differences apart, there isn’t much else distinct about this phone. It sticks to the Xiaomi Redmi Note formula, looking and feeling as familiar as ever.. While the design at the back is just about as standard as it gets for a Xiaomi device, the front is where the real changes are. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and Note 5 Pro feature 5.99-inch 18:9 full-HD+ (2160×1080 pixels) screens, and both do away with the capacitive off-screen Android navigation keys. You now get on-screen navigation keys by default, and these have been designed to occupy as little screen space as possible.. Now, while most phones that go with the 18:9 screen tend to minimize non-screen space at the front, there’s a fair bit of it on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro. I would hardly classify this as a bezel-less design, since there are wide non-screen areas on all four sides. The phone itself is larger than its predecessor as well, so it does lose out a bit in terms of compactness and the larger screen doesn’t fit itself in the same form factor.. One of two significant differences between the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and the Redmi Note 5 Pro is in the specifications. Xiaomi has gone back to the philosophy it adopted with the excellent Redmi Note 3 when choosing the chipset for the Redmi Note 5 Pro. The device is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 SoC, and is the first smartphone in the world to adopt this chipset. It’s a pretty impressive option, to say the least – it’s fabricated on the 14nm process and uses custom Kryo 260 cores in an eight-core setup. You can think of it as a lower-clocked Snapdragon 800-series SoC with a lot of the qualities of the Snapdragon 820, which is a very good thing in a phone that costs Rs 13,999.. Other advantages of the Snapdragon 636 are its Adreno 509 GPU and the Spectra 160 Image Signal Processor (ISP). This helps the chipset process photos and video better, also optimizing the processes for dual-camera setups such as the one on the Redmi Note 5 Pro. You also get either 4GB or 6GB of RAM on the Redmi Note 5 Pro, along with 64GB of internal storage which is standard on both variants. You do of course also get a hybrid SIM slot, a rear fingerprint sensor and a 4,000mAh battery.. Unfortunately, Xiaomi hasn’t included USB Type-C or fast charging out-of-the-box on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro, despite Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 being supported by the Snapdragon 636 SoC. Included in the sales package is a standard 10W charger.. Another slight disappointment is that the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro launches with Android Nougat, although the MIUI version is the latest stable version of MIUI 9. While Xiaomi is working on the Android Oreo update for the device, we don’t have firm word on when this will roll out. It could be a while, as Xiaomi only recently rolled out the Android Oreo update for the Android One-powered Mi A1.. Xiaomi Mi A1 Review: Truly A1!. MIUI 9 itself isn’t anything new, and we’ve already seen in on some of Xiaomi’s recent launches including the Mi MIX 2. Like on the Mi MIX 2, the interface is tweaked to take proper advantage of the larger screen and tall aspect ratio.. Typical benefits of MIUI that we’ve praised in the past are also present, including dual apps, block list, second space and the excellent security app. It’s the same familiar MIUI experience with the benefits of boosted hardware, and will likely appeal to buyers who have wanted a Xiaomi device similar to the Mi A1, but with MIUI on board.. Xiaomi Redmi 5A Review: Entry-level, but capable. As I had mentioned a bit earlier in my review, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 that powers the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is a new chipset that debuts globally with the phone. The SoC has nearly the same components as the Snapdragon 660 platform, but is clocked a bit lower which means that it can’t quite achieve the same level of peak performance. However, it does have the advantage of the Spectra ISP, which helps improve the capability of the camera.. However, the lower clock speed does help it achieve a better level of power efficiency. Indeed, battery life on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is fantastic. However, the fact that it has the ability to push performance a bit means that it isn’t as efficient as the Snapdragon 625 on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and Redmi Note 5.. We tested the Redmi Note 5 Pro with a handful of graphics-intensive games including Riptide GP2 , Reckless Getaway 2 and Asphalt Xtreme , and results were impressive for the most part. Although I did experience a few issues with frame-drops and stuttering performance on the latter two games, for the most part performance was excellent for a Snapdragon 600-series SoC.. The Adreno 509 GPU isn’t quite as capable as even the Adreno 530 on 2016’s Snapdragon 820, it’s nearly as good. Even with multi-tasking, we found performance to be impressive; I was able to run about 20 apps simultaneously on the phone and didn’t face any performance issues. On the whole, the Snapdragon 636 offers a great mix of performance, energy efficiency and affordability that makes the Redmi Note 5 Pro an incredibly capable performer for the price.. Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 Review: When a smartphone becomes an experience. When it comes to the battery, the phone will go for anywhere between one and two days on a single charge, depending on how you use it. Light usage will let the phone draw on its efficiency and keep you going longer, while heavier usage will naturally reduce the amount of time you can get on a charge. That’s the beauty of the Snapdragon 636 platform; it can work efficiently as well as powerfully, depending on how you use it. Unfortunately, the only negative here is that charging is slow. It takes a little over two hours to fully charge the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro’s 4,000mAh battery, which is far too slow for a phone at this price today.. One of the key ways that the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro differentiates itself from the more affordable Redmi Note 5 is the camera setup. The Redmi Note 5 Pro has a vertically-placed dual-camera setup at the rear, with a 12-megapixel primary sensor and a 5-megapixel secondary sensor. The 12-megapixel sensor features a 1.25-micron pixel size, and both sensors are RGB. The only feature that the dual-camera setup enables is portrait mode.. When shooting in normal mode, Xiaomi states that the sensor gathers additional information to help the ISP process the images better. We did try this out by blocking the secondary sensor in some shots, and the differences weren’t very evidently visible. The phone’s front camera is a massive 20-megapixel shooter, which is supported with lamp flash for low-light selfies. The front camera is also capable of portrait shots, but since it’s a single-sensor setup, it relies on software-based algorithms to achieve the effect.. Huawei Honor 9 Lite Review: Four cameras and stunning looks. Starting with the front camera, the sheer resolution on offer ensures that pictures are excellent. Considering that Indian buyers value good selfies, Xiaomi has made an excellent decision to boost the capability of the front camera, and the results are up to the mark. The presence of lamp flash ensures good pictures in low light, while the software-based portrait mode works effectively as well. It is, of course, a fixed focus camera sensor and works effectively only with selfies. You’ll have to maintain ordinary selfie distance between yourself and the camera for best results.. (Camera samples shot with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro). The Redmi Note 5 Pro’s rear camera is where the difference is. It’s a vertically placed setup like the one on the Apple iPhone X, with the lower sensor doing the real work. The second sensor enables portrait mode, and additionally serves to capture additional image information during normal photos as well, according to Xiaomi.. However, pictures I clicked covering the secondary sensor looked no different from shots with the sensor uncovered, and I’m a bit unsure about what the sensor achieves in ordinary conditions. The camera does take good pictures in all lighting conditions nonetheless and is on-par with what we’d expect from a mid-range device such as this. The specific image signal processing abilities of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 SoC do show here, and performance is certainly better than on the Redmi Note 4.. (Camera samples shot with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro). Coming to portrait mode on the rear camera, performance is improved here as well. The Redmi Note 5 Pro effectively uses its dual-camera setup to sense depth in images, producing images with neat outlines for foreground objects and people. The blur effect is strong and effective, and we’re impressed with the results of the portrait mode on the Redmi Note 5 Pro. On the whole, camera performance is impressive for the price.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro represents a big step-up for the Redmi Note series from the Chinese smartphone maker. It brings the range up to date with the current trends of 18:9 screens and dual-camera setups, also going a step ahead with its excellent front camera. Power users and fans of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 will appreciate the choice of SoC on the Redmi Note 5 Pro too. Simply put, this is almost a complete package when it comes to mid-range smartphones.. Sure, there are some drawbacks here worth highlighting. The phone launches with Android Nougat out of the box, and does not have fast charging. Had Xiaomi gone with Android Oreo and bundled at least a Quick Charge 3.0 charger in the box, I’d have given the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro 5 out of 5 stars.. If you’re looking for a reliable mid-range smartphone today, Xiaomi offers you two options in the Redmi Note 5 and Redmi Note 5 Pro. However, the phone you choose depends entirely on your budget and what you’re looking for. The Redmi Note 5 is more affordable, offers excellent value-for-money and will serve regular users just fine.. However, power users will be more reliably served by the Redmi Note 5 Pro, thanks to its superb hardware and wholesome approach in catering to the needs of practically every smartphone user in India. Here’s a phone that has been designed and developed for the Indian smartphone user, and it takes the title of our favorite mid-range smartphone of 2018..

Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and Redmi Note 5 Pro reveal their full specs ahead of official debut. Adrian Diaconescu February 13, 2018 3:49 am. There’s been a lot of confusion surrounding Xiaomi’s first low-cost “full screen” smartphones, which went official in China back in December as the Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus , despite rampant Redmi Note 5 speculation at one point leading up to their launches.. Conflicting reports returned with company confirmation of a February 14 event in India, officially teased by using the “Give me 5” tagline. Some people simply expected the original Redmi 5 duo to expand to the world’s second-largest smartphone market , while others anticipated entirely new devices.. The truth appears to lie somewhere in the middle, according to a couple of very convincing spec sheets prematurely leaked on Twitter earlier today. These unusually detailed promotional materials confirm “all-new” Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and Redmi Note 5 Pro handsets are coming, although technically, the former is just a rebranded Redmi 5 Plus.. We can’t find any difference whatsoever between the China-only Redmi 5 Plus and “India’s all-rounder”, as the Redmi Note 5 packs a Snapdragon 625 processor, your choice of 3 or 4GB RAM, with either 32 or 64GB internal storage, also making “great selfies better” with a 5MP LED front camera. That single 12MP rear shooter is still there, and the 18:9 5.99-incher creates an “incredibly long lasting experience” thanks to a high-capacity 4000mAh battery.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is a different beast altogether, as the world’s first commercial product with a Snapdragon 636 processor under the hood. Its Kryo CPU cores are paired with up to 6GB RAM, and a 4000mAh cell is still in charge of keeping the lights on.. Without a doubt, the most notable upgrades come in the imaging department, where the 5.99-inch “full screen” Redmi Note 5 Pro offers a pretty remarkable 12 + 5MP dual rear-facing camera setup, as well as a 20MP front snapper with LED selfie-light.

Xiaomi is proudly claiming to be the number one smartphone brand in India, and understandably, Samsung doesn’t agree. While I’m not one to take sides, the fact that Xiaomi has even come close to challenging the Chaebol, a company which has been topping the charts in the country for a very long time, is no mean feat. And that too within just four years of entering the subcontinent. While there are quite a few reasons for Xiaomi’s phenomenal growth, its affordable range of smartphones that offer great value for money have contributed significantly of course. That said, Xiaomi hasn’t really been fast enough when it comes to following global trends. Till yesterday, it only had one phone with dual cameras and none with an 18:9 display in India. Also, it didn’t really have a single phone in its portfolio that could be called a complete package in the true sense. That changes with the new Redmi Note 5 Pro. This baby rocks dual cameras and an 18:9 display, apart from offering solid specs, a powerful selfie shooter and a capacious battery, and on the face of it, doesn’t look like it misses out on any of the essential features. Not only is the Redmi Note 5 Pro the first phone from Xiaomi that brings dual cameras and a near bezel-less display, it’s also the strongest selfie smartphone from the brand yet. The Redmi Note 5 Pro comes as a souped-up variant of the Redmi Note 5 , a smartphone that was announced for India on the same stage. While the Redmi Note 5 is basically the Redmi 5 Plus that was launched in China earlier, the Note 5 Pro is actually a global launch, going on sale for the very first time in India. This is one of the things that make it special, but I’m just getting started… Summary The Redmi Note 5 Pro ticks all the right boxes in terms of the most coveted features, follows global trends and more importantly, delivers on almost everything that it promises. It’s not without its share of quirks though. Despite that however, it comes across as one of the most compelling smartphones priced south of Rs 20,000. Interested in knowing more? Read on. The basics While the Pro model shares its dimensions, screen specs and design language with its Redmi Note 5 sibling, the two are actually as different as chalk and cheese. For one, the Note 5 Pro comes powered by the octa-core Snapdragon 636 chipset, in comparison to the Note 5 that utilises the SD625 SoC. Next, the Pro model also has a 6GB RAM variant, unlike the Note 5. Also, the cameras on the two phones are quite different – the Pro gets a dual camera setup (comprising 12MP + 5MP sensors) and a 20MP front cam with a selfie light. In comparison, the Redmi Note 5 sports a single 12MP camera at the back, and a basic 5-meg shooter at front, each with its own flash. Design and display Up front is a 5.99-inch display, with the slimmest bezels you have ever seen on a Xiaomi phone. The screen’s 18:9 aspect ratio means the front is almost all screen, and the overall device size is akin to a conventional 5.5-inch phone. While the front looks good because of the slim bezels and the dual cameras add a bit of character to the back, the Note 5 Pro may not turn heads for its looks. The metal unibody feels quite sturdy though. Because of the camera bump containing the vertically-arranged dual shooters at the back, the phone wobbles slightly when kept on a flat surface. With nicely rounded edges, the phone nestles well in the palm, and doesn’t feel too heavy or unwieldy. One interesting design difference between the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Note 5 is that in the former, the 3.5mm headset socket has been placed at the bottom. The IR blaster can be found on its usual place at the top though. Also, unfortunately, the Pro (and its sibling) stick to the older micro-USB port and miss out on USB Type-C. Cameras I don’t really need to tell you how important smartphone cameras are in this day and age, and the Redmi Note 5 Pro comes packed in this regard. The 20MP front camera comes with its own selfie flash, and in terms of resolution, is pretty much the most powerful seen on a Xiaomi phone yet. It comes armed with a software-based depth mode as well, and can take good selfies. The dual camera setup at the rear comprises a 12MP main sensor with 1.25 micron pixel size, aided by a 5MP depth sensor. And thanks to this implementation, it offers a portrait mode that can do bokeh. Overall, the rear cameras offer solid results across different shooting conditions. The images turn out crisp and natural, and you also get an HDR mode which is quite effective, without being too obtrusive or making the images look artificial. Low-light shots turned out quite good too, and don’t show too much noise. On the flip side, the default camera app on the Redmi Note 5 Pro doesn’t offer an option to shoot video at 4K, and this is surprising considering the chipset supports it. I wouldn’t really hold this against the Pro though. Here are some images shot using the Redmi Note 5 Pro. Software In terms of software, the Redmi Note 5 Pro runs MIUI 9 with Android Nougat as base. Expect the usual MIUI goodies, including complete customisability with themes, dual apps, second space for those who want to keep work and play (or wife and girlfriend) separate, a full-fledged security manager, permissions manager, a reading mode for the display, etc. I especially love the subtle features – such as the Copy OTP feature in messages and the option to turn off just one instance of a recurring alarm, useful for when there’s a mid-week holiday. Performance and battery life The Note 5 Pro holds the distinction of being the first phone in India to come powered by the new Snapdragon 636 chipset. The octa-core Kyro CPU setup is clocked at 1.8GHz, and comes with Adreno 509 graphics. In real-life usage, it churns out a solid and smooth performance, without any overheating issues even when stressed. It’s mated to 4 gigs of RAM in my review unit, but there’s a 6GB RAM variant available too, suitable in case you feel you’re a power user and need better multitasking capabilities. That said, I found the 4GB RAM model to be quite zippy overall. Out of the built in 64GB storage, around 53 gigs is available to use out of the box. Connectivity options on the dual-SIM hybrid phone are fairly standard, and include dual-band Wi-Fi, 4G with VoLTE, and GPS, apart from the aforementioned IR blaster that works hand in hand with the preloaded Mi Remote app to convert your phone into a universal remote. The 4,000mAh battery delivers on its promise of offering all-day battery life, and therefore, you probably won’t need to hunt for a power source during the day, unless your usage is really quite heavy. The 91mobiles video loop test ran for nearly 21 hours before the battery died, so that should give you an idea of the kind of battery life this phone offers. Verdict As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, the Redmi Note 5 Pro barely misses out on any feature. If I were to nitpick, I would list the lack of 4K video recording and the use of a micro-USB port instead of the newer USB Type-C as cons. In reality though, the only thing I’d really count as a negative is the missing support for fast charging. If you consider the competition, the Honor 9i ( review ), the Moto G5S Plus ( review ), the Infinix Zero 5 ( review ) and Xiaomi’s own Mi A1 ( review ) come to mind, but nothing really comes close to the Redmi Note 5 Pro when it comes to offering everything in terms of dual cameras, 18:9 display, performance and battery life. At the end of the day, it boils down to the question – which phone offers the complete package. And I’d say that the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro comes very, very close.

Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro preview: Possibly the best budget phone of 2018. Yes, the Redmi Note 5 Pro is that good.. Xiaomi played it safe with the Redmi Note 5 , offering the same chipset and a design aesthetic that's similar to the Redmi Note 4. Instead, the manufacturer is rolling out the Redmi Note 5 Pro for those looking to upgrade from last year's device.. The Redmi Note 5 Pro is the first device to be powered by the Snapdragon 636. Xiaomi says that it worked closely with Qualcomm over the development of the chipset, leading to a noticeable uptick in performance over the Snapdragon 625-powered Redmi Note 5. The phone also features a dual rear camera setup, as well as a 20MP front camera with an LED flash module.. Xiaomi is touting software tuning as a key feature as a key differentiator for the front camera, with the Redmi Note 5 Pro also relying on artificial intelligence to automatically tweak settings based on your environment.. As for the design, the one major change from the Redmi Note 5 is the dual camera sensor at the back. Otherwise, the rest of the design is identical to the standard Redmi Note 5, which is in turn similar to that of the Redmi Note 4. The Redmi Note 4 itself was based on the Redmi Note 3, so we're now looking at a third year of the same design, and it's starting to look stale.. I'm not a big fan of the design of the rear camera module either. It looks like something that was bolted on at the last minute, and doesn't really co-exist with the rest of the phone's visual aesthetic.. Then there's the fact that the Redmi Note 5 Pro has a Micro-USB charging port, which means you lose out on fast charging. With the device aimed at an enthusiast segment, it would've made more sense for Xiaomi to roll out USB-C and fast charging, even if that meant increasing the cost of the phone by a few thousand rupees.. What the Redmi Note 5 Pro does get right is the display — it is the same 18:9 panel as the standard Redmi Note 5, and it's one of the best displays in this segment. The Snapdragon 636 chipset — which brings Qualcomm's custom Kryo cores to the mid-range segment — is also a step up from what we've seen in this category over the course of the last year.. I'll get into detailed benchmarks and the performance side of things in my review, but the Redmi Note 5 Pro manages to hit a score of 113,000 on AnTuTu without breaking a sweat. For context, the Redmi Note 5 with its Snapdragon 625 chipset is in the vicinity of 78,000. Synthetic benchmarks aren't a true indicator of a device's performance, but in the five days I've used the phone, it didn't lag or slow down.. The Redmi Note 5 Pro has all the ingredients to be a budget powerhouse.. The Redmi Note 5 Pro is very well equipped elsewhere too — you can pick up a model with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory, and you get a 4000mAh battery that easily lasts a day and a half on a full charge. There's also an IR blaster at the top, a 3.5mm jack, dual-band Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 4.1.. Xiaomi is touting the camera capabilities of the phone, saying that the camera is the best it introduced in this segment. The 5MP shooter augments the primary sensor well, and does a decent job of adding depth to images. For what it costs, it is pretty great, and sets the bar high for other budget phones. And for videos, you get EIS.. The manufacturer is also stating that the front 20MP shooter is the best selfie camera in the budget segment, going so far as to say that it is as good as the front camera on the Pixel 2 XL. I'll be putting those claims to the test in a post later this week, but for now, here's a first look at the Redmi Note 5 Pro's rear camera:. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 review: The best just got better. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro vs. Xiaomi Mi TV 4 preview: The next big thing is here. The Redmi Note 5 Pro misses out in a few areas — Xiaomi should have differentiated the product more with a revised design and included USB-C along with fast charging — but as an overall package, it is one of the best options available today.. The phone is going up for sale starting later this month, with the 4GB option with 64GB of storage for ₹13,999, and the 6GB variant with 64GB of storage for ₹16,999. The model with 4GB of RAM is available at launch, with the 6GB model going on sale at a later date.. Interested in knowing more about today's launches? Read our extended coverage:.

Xiaomi Redmi Note 5/Pro vs Redmi Note 4: Specs showdown. by Mitja Rutnik 2 weeks ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Which one is right for you?. The Redmi Note 5 series is here , and itâs time to see how it stacks up against the Redmi Note 4 in the specs department. But first, letâs compare the Redmi Note 5 and 5 Pro to see what the differences between the two are.. > Redmi Note 5 vs Honor 9 Lite. The Redmi Note 5 sports a 5.99-inch display with Full HD+ resolution, which means it has an aspect ratio of 18:9. Itâs powered by the Snapdragon 625 chipset and packs a large 4,000 mAh battery. Xiaomi claims the battery is good for around 14 hours of video playback and eight hours of continuous gaming.. There are two variants of the handset available: one with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage and the other with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and Redmi Note 5 Pro. The Redmi Note 5 is equipped with a single 12 MP camera on the back with an f/2.2 aperture. The front-facing camera has a 5 MP sensor and LED flash that will improve your selfies in low-light conditions. The handset runs Android Nougat with the MIUI 9 skin on top, supports expandable storage, and has a headphone jack. Thereâs also a fingerprint scanner on board thatâs located on the back, below the camera.. As its name suggests, the Pro model offers more than the Redmi Note 5. Itâs powered by a newer Snapdragon 636 chipset that has a better GPU, an improved LTE modem, and supports Bluetooth 5 .. The smartphone also puts more emphasis on the camera experience. Youâll find a dual-camera setup on the back featuring 12 and 5 MP sensors that let you add the popular bokeh effect to images. The front-facing camera offers a higher resolution at 20 MP and also sports LED flash for better low-light performance.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and Redmi Note 5 Pro. The high-end version of the smartphone comes with 6 GB of RAM, which is 2 or 3 GB of RAM more than the Redmi Note 5 â depending on the model. However, a 4 GB version of the Redmi 5 Pro is also available. Both variants come with 64 GB of expandable storage.. Other specs of the device are the same as those of the Redmi Note 5. That means the Pro model sports a 5.99-inch Full HD+ display and packs a 4,000 mAh battery. The battery life should be similar to that of the Note 5, as the Snapdragon 636 is also a very power efficient chipset. The Redmi Note 5 Pro runs Android Nougat with Xiaomiâs MIUI 9 user interface on top, features a headphone jack, and has a fingerprint scanner on the back.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and Redmi Note 5 Pro. So, how do these two devices compare to the Redmi Note 4? The Redmi Note 4 sports a smaller 5.5-inch Full HD display with a 16:9 aspect ratio. Nevertheless, it still has roughly the same footprint as the Redmi Note 5 and 5 Pro because of its much larger bezels. Itâs powered by the Snapdragon 625, which is surprisingly the same chipset found in the Redmi Note 5. As a reminder, the Redmi Note 4 made its debut a year and a half ago.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and Redmi Note 5 ProYou can get the Redmi Note 4 with 2, 3, or 4 GB of RAM and 16, 32, or 64 GB of storage. The high-end version offers the same amount of RAM and storage as the Note 5 and 2 GB of RAM less than the beefed-up Pro model. But keep in mind that 4 GB is still more than enough these days, even for demanding users.. The smartphone has a 13 MP primary camera on the back with an f/2.0 aperture and PDAF, while the selfie snapper features a 5 MP sensor â but lacks LED flash thatâs present on the Redmi Note 5 series. Out of the box, it runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with MIUI 8 on top but can be upgraded to Nougat .. The Redmi Note 4 has a larger battery than its successors at 4,100 mAh (+100 mAh). It also supports expandable storage, features a fingerprint scanner on the back, and has a headphone jack on board.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Xiaomi Redmi Note 4.

If youâre looking for the best Redmi Note smartphone, the 5 Pro is the obvious choice. It has the best chipset of the three smartphones, the most RAM (depending on the model), and a dual-camera setup on the back. However, both the Redmi Note 5 and the Note 4 are still great options if the extra power and camera capabilities don’t mean much to you.. The differences between them arenât massive, especially if you compare the high-end version of each device. Both offer the Snapdragon 625 chipset, 4 GB of RAM, and 64 GB of storage. The major thing that sets them apart is the display.. The one on the Note 5 is around 0.5 inches larger, which makes watching videos, playing games , and browsing the web a lot more enjoyable. It also has an 18:9 aspect ratio that became the new standard for flagships in 2017. But the overall size difference between the handsets is minimal, as the Note 5 sports thinner bezels than its predecessors.. Which one to get comes down to the price. If you donât mind spending more, the Redmi Note 5 is a better option than the Redmi 4. But if you want to save some cash and donât care much about the extra screen real estate or the more modern design the Redmi 5 offers, the Redmi 4 is the way to go..

Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 vs Redmi Note 5 Pro: Which One to Buy?. Xiaomi has introduced two new smartphones in more or less the same budget. In such a case, you may wonder which one to opt for. Here is all that is different and everything that is similar on both the smartphones and if one should go for the step-up variant over the lower offering or not.. Updated: February 15, 2018, 4:10 PM IST. Sarthak Dogra | News18.com @SarthakDogra. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (L) vs Redmi Note 5 (R).. Xiaomi looks set to dominate the budget smartphone market this year as well with its recently launched offerings, the Redmi Note 5 and the Redmi Note 5 Pro. While Xiaomi claims to have improved upon the shortcomings of the Redmi Note 4 for its successor, the Redmi Note 5, the company has also aimed to cater to those seeking an extra boost of performance through the step-up variant, the Redmi Note 5 Pro. Both the smartphone are priced just Rs 4,000 apart and in this wake, it might be a difficult choice as to which one to opt for in a budget. To solve this dilemma, here is a comparison between the two smartphones in terms of specifications, features and more. There are a lot of features embedded in the smartphones which are similar. For instance, the Redmi Note 5 and the Redmi Note 5 Pro sport the same display, sized at 5.99-inch and offering a 2160x1080 pixels Full HD+ resolution with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Even the body dimensions and the weight of both the smartphones is pretty much the same, with a maximum difference of 0.1mm in the length and 1 gram in the weight. Other specifications similar on both the smartphones are the Android 7.1.1 based MIUI 9, 4000 mAh battery and the connectivity options including a hybrid (Nano) SIM slot. The smartphones are also available in the market in the same colour options. Watch: Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Review: Best Bang For Your Buck at Rs 13,999. The Redmi Note 5 Pro carries certain upgrades over the Redmi Note 5, the most prominent one being the camera capability of the smartphone. While the Redmi Note 5 carries a single camera setup at the back with a 12-megapixel (f/2.2) sensor, the Redmi Note 5 Pro comes with a dual camera setup with one 12-megapixel (f/2.2) sensor and one 5-megapixel (f/2.0) sensor for depth effect. Comparing the front cameras, the Redmi Note 5 is restricted to a 5-megapixel sensor, with an enhanced pixel size and aperture for better low light photography as compared to the Redmi Note 4. In contrast, the Redmi Note 5 Pro comes with a whopping 20-megapixel front sensor and AI-based computing for depth effect. Both the smartphones offer LED Selfie Light and are capable of shooting 1080p videos at 30fps. A core segment where the Redmi Note 5 Pro overshadows the Redmi Note 5 is the chipset. Xiaomi has used a Snapdragon 636 processor on the Redmi Note 5 Pro, making it faster, more capable than the Redmi Note 5 which is powered by a Snapdragon 6525 chipset. The Redmi Note 5 starts retailing at Rs 9,999 for the 3GB RAM, 32GB storage variant, while the 4GB RAM, 64GB storage option is available for Rs 11,999. In contrast, the Redmi Note 5 Pro starts at Rs 13,999 for 4GB RAM, 64GB storage options and extends to a 6GB RAM option that is available for Rs 16,999. Comparing the top variant of the Redmi Note 5 to the lower variant of the Redmi Note 5 Pro (for the same memory offering), the Rs 2,000 price difference would account for a better performance and a much-enhanced camera setup. In our experience with the smartphones, these two performance criteria are refined enough on the Redmi Note 5 Pro to make those extra Rs 2000 worth the spend. And if incase one is going for an EMI option with the smartphones, one should definitely go for the Redmi Note 5 Pro. For those strict on their budget, the Redmi Note 5 3GB RAM option is a good buy.

Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro review: The new budget smartphone king, but competition is inching closer. It may have appeared to many that Xiaomi was sleeping over the success of its budget smartphone beast, the Redmi Note 4. In the meantime, Huawei with its Honor sub-brand launched a plethora of smartphones towards the end of 2017 and almost convinced many, that they had won over the budget to mid-range smartphone segment, with their Honor 9 Lite , Honor 7X and the Honor 9i .. The reality? No! They weren’t sleeping, but Xiaomi was plotting another successful plan, and I finally was made aware of the same, the minute I got my hands on their newest contender from the budget to mid-range segment.. World! Say hello to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro and it’s “unbeatable”; with every single offering from every smartphone brand, in its crosshairs.. Here’s why it is hard to argue that it’s anything but that.. Presenting the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Image: Tech2/Rehan Hooda. The Redmi Note 5 Pro is the “Pro” version of the Redmi Note 5 , which is the successor to the Note 4. While many would expect Xiaomi to bring together bits and pieces of its predecessor, no, the Pro is anything but that.. The Pro is a proper mid-range device that going by appearance would let many to believe that it belongs to the sub-Rs 30,000 segment instead of the sub-Rs 15,000 mark.. The design was typically Xiaomi (rounded corners, straight lines, curved back), and seems more like the evolution of the Note 4, but a lot better. The device is far from bezel-less, but it does feature an overall slimmer profile (way slimmer than the chunky Note 4).. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro looks outdated in front of the cheaper Honor 9 Lite. In short, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro will not win any design awards and does not look half as good as the pebble-like Honor 7X , but it's practical and polished nonetheless. Again, considering how aggressive Xiaomi's pricing is, we cannot expect it to add anything to this beast.. One detail I did note, was that the device features a narrower display in comparison to the flagship Mi Mix 2. This along with the gradual curve of the back makes the smartphone a lot easier to grip and hold than the mostly flat Mi Mix 2.. That 2.5D glass screen fits nicely and feels polished. The fit and finish are top class, despite sporting plastic caps at the top and bottom on the back, with a metal panel taking up the majority of the centre. In short, the device is a delight to hold and did not slip out of my hand thanks to the thin shiny ridges that appear at the top and the bottom.. 3.5 mm jack is still there, but so is a micro USB port. Despite its abnormal heft at 181 grams (which also lends it a premium feel), what will catch your attention is that very iPhone X-like dual camera setup at the back.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro's camera looks like a copy of the Apple iPhone X.Image: Tech2/Sheldon Pinto. The camera protrudes much like an iPhone camera does. It protrudes far out from the rest of the back and this makes it annoying to type on when the device is placed on a table. However, you can remedy the same by using a case cover, but the camera is something you will want to show off because the Pro is more about the camera experience than anything else.. When it comes to features, the Pro once again seems to be ahead of the competition. Xiaomi debuted the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 SoC in India with the launch of the Redmi Note 5 Pro. This houses an 8x Kryo 260 CPU clocked at 1.8 GHz along with Adreno 509 GPU.. The new chipset is paired with 4 GB and 6 GB RAM modules along with 64 GB internal storage as standard. We received a unit with 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage.. The display is a 5.99-inch FHD+ unit featuring a resolution of 2,160 x 1,800 pixels in an 18:9 aspect ratio covered with 2.5D screen.. Moving to the cameras, Xiaomi offers a 12 MP + 5 MP dual setup at the back with a 20 MP Sony IMX376 unit for selfies on the front.. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 4G with support for VoLTE and a micro USB port (USB 2.0) at the bottom.. Powering all of the above is a 4,000 mAh with 5V/2A charging. As for the software, it’s the usual MIUI 9 with Android 7.0 Nougat as the base.. With my primary device being the large (and heavy) Apple iPhone 8 Plus , I often kept forgetting how large and tall the display of the Redmi Note 5 Pro really was.. To give you an idea, the 5.99-inch display fits into the footprint of the iPhone 8 Plus (5.5-inch display) with room to spare for the various sensors and earpiece at the top and a small chin at the bottom. Everything is well spaced out even though the display is not edge-to-edge like on the iPhone X or the Mi Mix 2 .. The FHD+ display is sharp and clearly, best in class with some polished, well- rounded corners. Another detail that Pro does really well, is around the corners of the display. They look pristine and polished and are not squared out like those on the Honor 9i , lending it a premium look. The well finished 2.5D glass screen with a rounded lipping, also adds to the premium feel when swiping in from the corners.. What I like about the display was how accurately it rendered colours without going overboard with the saturation and tone. These levels can also be adjusted using MIUI’s display mode customisations to a user’s liking.. The display was a sharp, sharp enough to render all those fine lines and text in Xiaomi’s MIUI 9 accurately without any jagged edges.. Rounded corners and accurate colours (Xiaomi claims its display is 83 percent NTSC) aside, I also liked the fact the display rarely caught fingerprints or dust.. While the brightness levels did drop from the steepest viewing angles, it dropped far less (not as noticeable) as compared to Honor’s displays. In short, Xiaomi engineers have done a fantastic job with the display and I feel sad that even the mighty Mi Mix 2 does can’t hold a candle in front of the Pro.. The software onboard was typically Xiaomi. You get the massive customisation options with an active theme store with tons of themes to choose from. new here to explore unless you are into split view multitasking.. The carousel-like selector for the split view function looks really cool.. As mentioned in the build and design, the Pro is taller than most other smartphones Xiaomi has launched in the past. It also features a higher PPI meaning that it can easily display more data than a Mi Max 2 as well. With that said, the display scaling works it favour and makes it ideal for split-screen multitasking. And I like how well Xiaomi has implemented it in the Pro, despite arriving late to(or falling behind) the game.. Software on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro needs an update to Android Oreo... I also liked, how smooth and fluid the animations and transitions were showing no signs of slowdown or lag.. With Xiaomi’s MIUI around, it was obvious that it fell behind with core Android software updates. Xiaomi’s latest and greatest mid-range buster sadly, still ships with Android Nougat 7.1.1 inside. Honestly speaking, it’s hard to find any other manufacturer that offers Oreo out of the box in this price range apart from the Honor 9 Lite. Xiaomi needs to work hard on this front, just launching new smartphones isn't enough.. Clearly, asking for software updates, on non-Pixel and Android One devices, is going to be a thing of the past, considering that just 1.1 percent of Android devices feature them. The Pro features a security patch level from 05 December 2017.. What I really liked about the Redmi Note 5 Pro was the vibration motor, that when set at the lightest level, gives a sharp and distinct feedback that is closer to the Pixel 2 (even if it's not as accurate). It feels refined and convinced me to leave the vibration on even when using the keypad (the sensation is usually too horrid on most smartphones save for the Pixel 2).. Vibrations aside, the performance is top notch as is easily the best in class, despite its worrying clock speed that is set at 1.8 GHz as compared to the Honor 9i’s 2.3 GHz. It’s clearly what you do with what you have that matters and the Pro offers the best we have seen in this segment.. Gaming quality here is more mid-range than budget. The shiny new Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 silicon fares well and surprisingly better than the Huawei’s Kirin 659 SoC. Graphic intensive games like Asphalt 8: Airborne and Xtreme ran smoothly with setting maxed out (High and HDPI, Better Quality) and the smartphone did not heat up even after extended gaming which is great stuff for a budget device as most out there usually do. More importantly, the battery kept up.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and Note 5 Pro performance Infogram. Audio quality through the headphones was great with the DAC giving greater emphasis to the bass notes. The speaker is loud and clear and very unlike the Honor 9i. I was bold enough to place a phone call on loudspeaker in the middle of traffic and crowded marketplaces and hear the caller not just loudly but also very clearly. More importantly, the speaker is placed at the top right corner when held horizontally, which did not see my palm block the speaker like most phones do while gaming or streaming movies. Things are indeed well thought off here.. Voice quality was on par with competition using both VoLTE and standard 4G networks.. Since the benchmarking tools were blocked during the review period, we will update this section with the benchmark comparison charts when available.. “OMG!” Is what everyone in the office had to say when they saw the photos this Rs 13,999 smartphone is capable of capturing.. Daylight, low-light, no-light, the Redmi Note 5 Pro seems to have added some AI to the mix, that lets it shoot in almost every perceivable condition you can throw at it.. Note that this does not only apply to the 12 MP + 5 MP rear facing camera setup, but the software driven front-facing 20 MP camera as well.. The device is so good, that I ended up clicking one too many photos for this review with pleasing results.. You can check them out in the Flickr gallery below.. Dissecting the images that I have clicked, the dual camera setup at back, does a brilliant job given the smartphone’s price tag.. In broad daylight, focusing is quick and same applies to the speed of clicking photos, which seems to offer zero shutter lag. The quality of the images are top notch for its class, delivering detailed images that were not overtly sharp (although sharpness levels can be modified in Camera Settings). Colours were spot on and better looking than the photos we clicked using a OnePlus 5T. They were very close to the actual scene. The dynamic range was really good and it's the reason why I rarely ended up turning on the HDR mode (but more about this later).. Moving to low light or dimly lit scenarios, the Redmi Note 5 Pro took them in stride. While you cannot compare these images to an iPhone X or a Pixel 2 , they are the best we could achieve in its segment, beating the Honor 9i’s low light performance by a mile. Focus was quick in low light as well, although the colours were a bit saturated for my taste.. With a single 20 MP sensor for the front camera I expected Xiaomi to play the usual numbers game, like every other Chinese smartphone manufacturer does these days.. To my surprise the performance, not just in daylight but even low light, was breathtaking.. With a software (more AI driven) Depth Effect mode on (small concentric circles icon in selfie camera mode), I managed to take some stunning low light selfies, something that every selfie smartphone, is incapable of (they perform better in daylight).. The Portrait mode on the rear facing camera too seems to have some AI smarts because it detects edges like no other camera smartphone in its class.. The camera on the front deserves an applause too! Image: Tech2/Rehan Hooda. All-in-all, the camera performance is top notch and sets new standards for its segment, more so given its price.. What I missed in comparison to the Honor 7X is the depth data which is not stored, meaning that the images cannot be fiddled with after you have clicked them. Another area where I would love to see an update is the HDR mode.. While I rarely ended up using it, it needs to be turned on manually every time when using the rear camera. The selfie camera has an option to keep it to ‘Auto’, which is great, but as expected I wasn’t able to use HDR with the Depth Effect switched on. Still, these are just my suggested improvements for what is an impressive set of cameras and camera software.. Video locked under 30 fps was a bit disappointing. The camera struggled to maintain a steady framerate while panning and given what Snapdragon 636 is capable of 4K 30 fps video recording , (120 fps Full HD) it's shocking that Xiaomi hasn't taken advantage of it.. With a 14 nm SoC and a lower clock speed, I expected the Xiaomi Redmi Pro to out do its successor and its competitors and it did so without breaking sweat.. Using it as my daily driver for almost a week I saw the Redmi Note 5 Pro deliver about 2 days of battery life. My usage included, the usual Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, two email accounts on sync, streaming an hour or two of video, some calls and about two hours of gaming each day.. For a power user (which should be over my above-mentioned usage), this should last a bit over a day.. All of this is impressive because it features a 5.9-inch FHD+ display. So kudos to Xiaomi’s software team for all the optimisations. Since Xiaomi only provided us with a review unit and no charger, I cannot confirm the charging speed of the device. Using a standard Oppo charger, I managed to get it from 0-100 percent in a little over two and half hours.. When I first got hold of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (that’s a long name), I assumed it was just another Chinese device with a tall display. After switching it on and then trying that camera, that impression quickly wore off as it was clear that Xiaomi is not just back in the game, but wants to be at the very top.. The new king of the budget segment!. The Redmi Note 5 Pro is the eventual evolution of the Redmi Note series. It may be priced a bit higher in the budget to mid-range segment, but its performance easily makes up for its price hike. Add to this is brand new chipset and it takes down the Honor 7x ,. Honor 9i , the Moto X4 , Vivo V7 Plus , Coolpad Cool Play 6 and even the Oppo A83 .. While smartphone brands had a tough time dealing with the Note 4’s success through 2017, there’s now a new headache for everyone else to deal with in the Rs 15k price segment.. If you love your Redmi Note 4, the Note 5 Pro is totally worth it. If you are looking for a budget to mid-range device, then look no further, a new king has been crowned!. #Redmi Note 5 Pro Battery Life.

The Redmi Note 5 offers everything you need from a sub-15K phone today - superior performance, excellent battery life and a good camera.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Rating 81/100. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is currently the best smartphone you can buy in the sub 15K segment. It offers excellent performance, has a two-day battery life, both front and rear cameras are good and it hasa sturdy build quality.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro: Detailed Review. In just a few years Xiaomi has outshined most of its competition in the budget segment. While the older Redmi phones were good, the tides turned in 2016 with the launch of the Redmi Note 3, which was a superb phone in all regards. It won our best phone under the budget categoryaward for the year and last year, the award was claimed by the Redmi Note 4. You can see a trend here, the phones were just that good. Hence, the new Redmi Note 5 Pro has a lot to live up to. Yes, there is the Redmi Note 5 as well, but this is the phone which is the true successor to last year's Redmi Note 4.. The new phone brings a dual camera and the Univisium display to the Redmi line, which thanks to Honor and many others, have become the norm in the category. However, that was more or less expected from a phone launching in 2018. That said, according to us, the newest aspect of the device is the chip that powers it. The Snapdragon 636 is not just a new chip, the Note 5 Pro is the first phone to bring it to India and combined with 4000mAh battery (again), Xiaomi might just have a winner at its hands.. Build and Design: New Design, same approach. With the Redmi Note 4 we had a small complaint about the width of the phone and with the Note 5 and the Note 5 Pro, that has been resolved. Xiaomi's solution is to provide a taller 18:9 aspect ratio display. The taller 5.99-inch 2160 x 1080p display is still not the best size for a comfortable fit, even though the width is now lesser than Its predecessor. That said, it is definitely an improvement over the last phone. The display has rounded corners and thinner bezels, which add to the whole design appeal. The curved back does make the phone easier to grip, but at the same time, it feels heavy and does take some time getting used to. There is no improvement as such in terms of materials used and unlike the Moto G5s Plus or the Mi A1, the Redmi Note 5 still doesn't have a metal unibody. It still has plastic inserts on both the top and bottom of the metal back to incorporate the antennas.. The dual cameras at the rear also comewith a rather pronounced camera bump, which means the phone rocks everytime you tap on the display if it's on a flat surface. Ideally, the rather large dual camera module at the rear should have been sitting flush with the body and notjuttingout. All that said, the Redmi series was never really about the looks. Over the years, it has maintained its utilitarian and accessible approach towards design and build quality, and this new variant is no different.. Display and UI: Nothing to complain about, except Oreo. Things get a little exciting as on this 18:9 display, the newer MIUI 9 feels at home. The 5.99-inch display here is just as good as we have come to see on Xiaomi devices. Xiaomi is still using an IPS LCD panel on the phone which has good viewing angles and goodcolourreproduction. Thecolourfidelity is not perfect, by default, the display is calibrated to push out slightly warmer tones, which looks quite pleasing to view in day-to-day use. We have no complaints about the touch response but, Xiaomi doesn't specify whether the Redmi Note 5 Pro has Gorilla Glass on top for that added safety. One could guess that it has some kind of toughened glass but not the latest gorilla glass protection.. MIUI looks just ascolourfulas it has been over the years. The first thing we should mention that you are not getting Android Oreo out of the box. This is somewhat disappointing as Oreo is thelatest version of the OS and brings not just added security but support for Contextual press-to-hold options, Adaptive icons, bundled notifications, better notifications controls, background app management, faster and better support for applications. Moreover, a recent poll done by Xiaomi itself suggest that customers not only prefer the latestAndroid,but the stock version of Android over MIUI. However, that poll was that taken down by the company.. On the Note 5 Pro, MIUI9 carries forward it's no app drawer approach and tries to offer some added features such as dual apps and second space. With dual apps, one can run separate accounts of the same service/app and the second space functionality provides separate user experiences for example for work and home. Both are available in the settings menu. Besides that, you get some pre-loaded apps such as Microsoft apps, Facebook, Amazon, Myntra and Amazon Prime Videos app. You still get the added tools (calculator, clock, file manager, etc) and Xiaomi also has its own app store on-board which seems completely unnecessary since Google Play store is already here.. The UI also seems to be optimised towards offering better battery life out of the box and keeps the brightness always a little lower than required. It works and we are happy for that, more on that later.. Performance: Pushing the envelope even further. The main feature as we mentioned earlier seems to be the new chip on the phone aka Qualcomm Snapdragon 636. Xiaomi told us that it is the "spiritual successor" to the Redmi Note 3, which got rave reviews thanks to the Snapdragon 650, which back in 2016 blew every other phone out of the water. Xiaomi wants to relive that success story and says that the company has been closely listening to its Mi fans and thus we have this phone. Manufactured on a 14nm process the SD636 uses eight Kryo 260 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and is more similar to the Snapdragon 660 which uses the same Kryo 260 core clocked at 2.2GHz. Qualcomm claims that the Kryo 260 allows for 40% better performance than the Snapdragon 630 powered by eight ARM A53 cores. Along with an Adreno 509 GPU, the Redmi Note 5 Pro just blazes past every other phone at the same price point in synthetic benchmarks.. The story is pretty similarinday-to-day tasks and we saw the phone outperform each and every budget phone we have tested at the same price bracket (currently available). Be it the loading times in Injustice 2, opening multiple apps or just switching between multiple heavy apps and games. We even opened all available apps on the phone which were more than 50 and even that couldn't bring the phone to a halt. However, during our use, the system always ran a little heavy with 600MB - 800MB free out of the 4GB of available RAM. The phone never felt slower in comparison to its rivals. When taxed to its limits, the Redmi Note 5 Pro does occasionally show signs of lag. Though the lag will only be perceivable if you have used a flagship class phone prior (for instance, OnePlus 5). Otherwise, you will be happy with the performance.. The other good thing we observed that the phone hardly gets warm after playing on the phone for an hour straight. Xiaomi says that the phone has a single pyrolytic graphite sheet which decreases the temperature by 1-degree celsius. The audio quality with the equalizer enabled is as good as any other phone under 25K and we have no issues with the quality and reception of calls.. Battery life: Still runs for two days straight. As we mentioned earlier, the UI on the device has a tendency to lower brightness slightly more than required and is more optimized to save battery life. That combined with a 4000mAh battery and a power efficient SoC means that you get up to two days of battery life out of this phone quite easily. The battery just won't die in a day. We tried draining the battery with multiple apps in the background and playing Injustice 2 with headphones on and after two hours gaming, the battery went down by just 20% percent. If you haven't calculated that yet, that is almost 9-10 hours of heavy gaming. Streaming videos on the larger display is a joy and the battery life will easily move into double digits, even if you are watching everything in full brightness. We liked the battery life on the Redmi Note 4 and with that big bump in performance, we are loving the battery life on the Note 5 Pro.. It seems like Xiaomi has been not just listening to its Mi fans, but had an ear open to the feedback most of us reviewers provided last year about the camera. The new dual camera setup, though looks inspired offers much better results than its predecessors. You have a 12MP primary camera (Sony IMX486) with a sensor size of 1.25um and an aperture of f/2.2. The secondary 5MP camera is used for depth sensing only and has a sensor size of 1.12um with f/2.0 aperture.. In ample lighting conditions, the camera captures a good amount of details and has a punchycolourreproduction. Thecolourreproduction is a little exaggerated, but it's not too far off and at the end of the day will looks pleasing to the normal user. Low light image capabilities are equally good and the camera has good dynamic range. The images captured in low light conditions, retain details quite well and keep thecoloursin check. If you ask us, this is as good a camera as the Mi A1 and in some areas even beats the Mi A1. For reference, Xiaomi Mi A1 has been ourtop ratedcamera in the 15K segment.. The secondary camera at the back does not offer optical zoom, the main purpose is depth sensing. That said, it does help in the image quality and offering better subject separation. From all the images we have taken so far, the portrait images look better than most of its competitors. They carry plenty of details and the background blur is also quite good for the price. We also liked the fact that there is no beautify settings in the portrait mode, which means you will be gettingnatural lookingportraits.. Compared to the camera quality, the video mode on the phone is rather disappointing. First, the video is cropped down to 8.3MP to produce a 1080p video, which is the max resolution the phone can shoot in and then the quality of the video is not great. Also, the phone cannot shoot in more than 30fps, even though the SD636 is capable of shooting up to 4K UltraHD capture @ 30fps and 1080p videos can shot @120fps. At the front, the phone features a 20MP IMX376 sensor which takes good images in all kinds of lighting conditions. There is a front-facing flash as well, which does blind you when you take the image, but the images do not look as burnt out as such. You also get software based portrait image, which lets you take that 'Bokeh' image with background blur and is decent at best, but not as good as the one you will get from the rear camera.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is quite simply the new king in its segment. It offers the sought after combination of performance (speed) and brilliant battery life. The display is good and both the rear and front cameras leave little room for any complaints. We just feel Xiaomi should have launched the phone with Android 8.0 out of the box and with USB Type-C. Xiaomi claims to be the number 1 smartphone brand in the country and has the ability to set the standard higher, so why not walk the talk?. That said, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro comes out as a winner and sets the benchmark for all mid-tier smartphones coming out this year. It is quite simply the best phone you can buy today at its price.. For more infographics please visit - http://www.digit.in/mobile-phones/xiaomi-redmi-5-note-pro-review-review-126065.html.

Redmi Note 5 Pro first impressions: This is the first smartphone that launching with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor and will comes in a 6GB RAM variant as well. Here's how it Redmi Note 5 Pro performed for us.. Technology Mobile & Tabs Redmi Note 5 Pro first impressions: At Rs 13,999 this is Xiaomi’s new ‘All-Rounder’. Redmi Note 5 Pro is priced at Rs 13,999 for the 4GB RAM version, while the 6GB RAM variant will cost Rs 16,999. It will go on sale on Flipkart, Mi.com on February 22. Here’s our first impression of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 5 Pro. Redmi Note 5 Pro comes with ultra-thin bezels on the side, though these are not completely invisible.

Redmi Note 5 Pro shot taken indoors. Updated: February 17, 2018 9:21 am. Xiaomi ’s Redmi Note series is back with the Redmi Note 5 being unveiled in the Indian market for a starting price of Rs 9,999. However, Redmi Note 5 is not the only device that the company is introducing; a new Redmi Note 5 Pro smartphone and the Mi LED TV 4 in 55-inches size with the company’s own PatchWall OS are also launching in India.. The Redmi Note 5 Pro is the first smartphone launching with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor. The original Redmi Note 5 series continues with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, which we also saw on the Redmi Note 4 from last year. The Pro variant sports a bigger 18:9 display which is 5.99-inches in size, a dual camera at the back, which is aligned horizontally and might remind some of the iPhone X. The front camera is 20MP on the Redmi Note 5 Pro and also has a selfie LED flash. There’s also a 6GB RAM variant as in the Pro series.. It would be fair to call the Redmi Note 5 Pro as the more beefed up variant of the Redmi Note 5 with a higher pricing as well. Redmi Note 5 Pro will cost Rs 13,999 for the 4GB RAM and 64GB variant, while the 6GB RAM and 64GB variant is priced at Rs 16,999. Redmi Note 5 Pro will go on sale on Flipkart from February 22. We’ve had the chance to use the Redmi Note 5 Pro for a few days ahead of the launch and here’s our detailed first impression so far.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Design, Display. Redmi Note 5 Pro sticks with metal unibody design that has become common on Xiaomi phones, but this time there is a big change. The display is 5.99-inches, but with an 18:9 aspect ratio and the buttons are now in-screen and not on the bottom bezel as was the case with the previous phones. This is not entirely a bezel-less display and you can see them on the sides, though they are very thin. On the top, there’s also the 20MP selfie camera with a flash along with IR blaster.. The fingerprint sensor remains at the back and this one still has a hybrid dual-SIM slot. Xiaomi has not gone for a dedicated dual SIM and microSD slot like we saw in the Redmi Y1 series. The dual rear camera is tucked away on one corner of the phone and it juts out quite prominently. The rear camera specification is 12MP+5MP for the Redmi Note 5 Pro.. This might be the Pro variant, but Xiaomi still sticking with the older micro-USB port. There’s also no fasting charging on this phone, though it has a 4000 mAh battery. The headphone jack and a single speaker are also placed at the bottom of the phone. Overall, the build quality of the Redmi Note 5 Pro feels premium and using this with one hand is not a problem. But, this is a bulky phone and not light given that it sports a 4000 mAh battery on board.. Also read: Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 review: Priced at Rs 9,999, the new budget smartphone to beat. Coming to the display and the quality, the Redmi Note 5 Pro’s 18:9 aspect ratio display means a lot more viewing space for video. The resolution is now FHD+ (2160 x 1080) and videos on this look crisp and the display works well even in sunlight. Colour reproduction is mostly accurate, and the viewing angles are not bad. However, the Redmi Note 5 also has a similar display, so I wish Xiaomi had offered something extra for the Pro here.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Performance, Specifications, Software and Battery. In terms of specifications, Redmi Note 5 Pro will have a 6GB RAM variant this time, though I have the 4GB RAM one for review. The smartphone runs Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor, which Xiaomi says comes with Kyro micro-architecture, which has previously been limited to the Snapdragon 800 series. The 800 series is usually seen on flagship phones. On Antutu, the Redmi Note 5 Pro scores around 100,000 plus for us, which is impressive for phone priced at under Rs 17,000. On the PCMark Battery test, Redmi Note 5 Pro last around 12 hours, which is expected given this has a huge battery on board.. Redmi Note 5 Pro has not given any cause for complaints in daily performance, though I am yet to play some graphics heavy games on this. When it came to video consumption, browsing multiple tabs on Chrome, the Redmi Note 5 Pro performed smoothly. Also it takes around 2 hours plus to get it to a full 100 per cent from under 20 per cent, which is not bad.. Redmi Note 5 Pro and Redmi Note 5’s biggest issue would be the software. Both phones are still on Android Nougat with MIUI 9 and this is 2018. Ideally I feel the company should have gone with Android Oreo for its customers, though there is no exact timeline on when an update will happen for both phones. Additionally, Xiaomi also plans to add features like Facial Recognition to the Redmi Note 5. This will be rolled out as a OTA update in March 2018.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Camera. Camera is supposed to be the highlight of the Redmi Note 5 Pro because it has two sensors at the back. This is also the first Redmi phone to sport a 20MP front camera, which also has a Portrait mode. Xiaomi even went on to bring in comparisons with Pixel 2 and iPhone X during the launch presentation. In my opinion, there are just one or two phones that can match the Pixel 2 in this department. I have used the Redmi Note 5 Pro’s camera and I would say the Portrait mode is impressive when I’m considering the price. The colours are definitely not as bright in some instances, I felt. In fact in my mind I kept comparing it to Mi A1’s rear camera which is fast and has an edge over this. Redmi Note 5 Pro’s camera could do with a few software tweaks to improve the performance.. The front selfie camera is not bad, and the Beautify mode now has customisations for India. For instance, it won’t blur out nose pins or bindis, when someone is taking a selfie. Still the Portrait mode on selfies works nicely when there is ample light, though in low-light, this is another story. The Redmi Note 5 Pro’s low-light performance is still not as good and details are missing from the pictures.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Early Verdict. There’s no doubt that for its price, the Redmi Note 5 Pro looks very promising. Performance will not be an issue considering the specifications, the display is excellent, and the camera should keep most users happy. Battery life is another highlight of the Redmi Note 5 Pro, and will easily last more than a day. But what Xiaomi has got right with the Redmi Note 5 Pro is the pricing. It is essentially offering the phone for under Rs 14,000 with sufficient RAM and storage and that could make a big difference in how people choose between this and Redmi Note 5..

Xiaomi is planning to unveil a new smartphone on 14th Feb at an event in India, and the highly anticipated Redmi Note 5 is expected to debut at that event. Interestingly a source on Twitter pointed out that along with the standard Redmi Note 5 variant; the Chinese OEM will also launch a more premium variant of the Note 5 namely the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which will have a mild spec bump over the conventional device.. Now according to this tipster, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro will feature a 5.7-inch or a larger 5.9-inch Full-HD plus display (1080 x 2160pixels). Along with this he also reveals the most noteworthy detail that’s its processor that takes the responsibility under its hood, it will be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 which is an absolute beast when it comes to power and efficiency. The Snapdragon 636 is based on Qualcomm’s Custom Kryo 260 cores and has 30% or more performance compared to the Snapdragon 630..

Another more interesting thing here is that the Redmi Note 5 Pro variant will also get an additional 6GB RAM option, but the storage remains the same at 64GB, which is more than enough for this price segment. However, the Hybrid solution for the SD-Card and Sim seems like its going nowhere with this one.. Unfortunately, the Redmi Note 5/5 Pro will run on Android Nougat 7.0 even in this age, but the custom skin version gets a bump to MIUI 9.5. Which should be updated to the MIUI 10 or MIUI X in the coming future. Lastly, Xiaomi is also expected to launch a new smart Mi TV as well along with its hero budget devices which are getting ready to hit another record in India.. TAGS Redmi Note 5 Redmi Note 5 Pro.
