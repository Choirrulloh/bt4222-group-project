Gionee W909 Flip Phone With Dual Touchscreens, Fingerprint Sensor Launched. Robin Sinha , 30 March 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. As expected , Gionee on Tuesday launched its W909 clamshell Android smartphone in China. Priced at CNY 3,999 (roughly Rs. 41,000), the handset is already up for pre-orders in the country. Its availability details outside China have not yet been mentioned.. It is worth mentioning that the Gionee W909 is also arguably one of the first flip phones in the market to come with a fingerprint sensor, USB Type-C port, and dual touchscreens as well. It sports a metal build and houses some high-end specifications under-the-hood.. The Gionee W909 runs Android 5.1 Lollipop and supports dual-SIM functionality. It includes two 4.2-inch HD (720x1280 pixels) resolution IPS display, with the outer display featuring a 2.5D glass. The smartphone is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6755M processor, clubbed with 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM.. The smartphone bears 64GB of inbuilt storage, of which 52GB is user-accessible. The built-in storage can be expanded via microSD card (up to 128GB). The Gionee W909 bears a 16-megapixel rear camera with phase detection autofocus (PDAF) and LED flash, along with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera.. On the connectivity front, the flip phone supports 4G LTE networks, along with Bluetooth v4.0, GPS, Wi-Fi, and USB Type-C connectivity. Backed by a 2530mAh battery, the W909 on paper can deliver up to 29.7 hours of talk time and 408 hours of standby time. It measures 124.1x62.8x16.5mm, weighs 207 grams, and features a fingerprint sensor at the back that can unlock the handset in 0.38 seconds.. Since the Gionee W909 carries a flip phone design, it also has T9 keypad with physical buttons to navigate, launch the camera and more, besides having an on-screen keyboard. It is only available in Rose Gold colour variant.. ( Also see: Gionee W909 vs. The last flip phone by a popular tech brand was seen by Samsung in November last year as it launched the W2016 smartphone in China. The Android-based dual-SIM smartphone features two 3.9-inch Super Amoled touchscreens, both with WXGA (768x1280 pixels) resolution. Although it sports nearly the same innards as the Gionee W909, it lags behind in terms of battery and RAM. It also misses out on a fingerprint sensor and USB Type-C connectivity.. LG too last year launched its flip phone, the Wine Smart but with less-powerful specifications..

Gionee shows that flip phones aren't dead with the W909. From Samsung to LG, smartphone companies still make flip phones geared towards particular. regions, regardless of how shocked you may be. Gionee is one such company, and its. recently announced W909 happens to be one such flip phone, reports GizChina .. through TENAA , China’s version of the Federal Communications Commission, the W909 features two 4.2-inch displays on the front and back of the phone, with both offering a 1,280 x 720 resolution. A 16-megapixel camera sits above the fingerprint sensor, which is. quickly becoming a common feature in modern smartphones but is incredibly rare for a flip phone. Meanwhile, a 5MP shooter sits above the. interior display, though it probably would have made more sense to have it sit above the exterior display.. Under the hood, the W909 packs an octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor, which is paired with 4GB of RAM, an amount of memory that. is still confined to the upper echelon of smartphones. The generous 64GB of built-in storage is supplemented by the Micro SD card slot, while the 2,530mAh battery should keep the lights on all day long.. The W909 even includes a USB Type-C port, utilized by a very small subset of products compared to the majority.. Finally, and most disappointingly, the W909 is stuck with Android 5.1 Lollipop, with Gionee’s custom Amigo UI layered. We’re not sure when, or if, the handset is supposed to receive Android 6.0 Marshmallow.. The smart flip phone may pack powerful internals, but its price tag of 3,999 Yuan — roughly $615 — certainly matches that power. As for availability, don’t expect the W909 to make its way outside of China, though you could certainly import one, if you really wanted to. Regardless, the W909 seems to put Samsung’s latest flip phone, the W2016, to absolute shame, for whatever that’s worth.. Samsung’s W2018 combines the best features of smartphones and flip phones.

Probably as a response to Samsung's W2016 and LG's Wine, Chinese brand Gionee takes a stab at the smart flip phone concept with the W909, a premium-specked Android 5.1 Lollipop clamshell equipped with two 4.2-inch HD screens, an eight-core 1.8GHz processor assisted by a whopping 4GB RAM LPDDR3 RAM, and a 16-megapixel PDAF primary camera.. This leather-clad phone's specs also include a fingerprint detector, VoLTE, a USB Type-C port, and a 64GB memory that you can expand by up to 128GB. It also sports a passable 5-megapixel selfie camera, but has a near-average 2530mAh battery capacity.. Rocking a rare (for a smartphone) clamshell form factor, and incidentally, two 4.2-inch screens, does the Gionee W909 pack enough features to contend with other 2016 flagship models? We flip through its pros and cons here. You Should Also Be Interested In These:. * Spec accuracy is not guaranteed. Please do a confirmation of the key specs before making a final choice.

Gionee Officially Launches Gionee W909 & S8 In China. March 29, 2016 - Written By Kristijan Lucic. Gionee is not exactly the most popular China-based smartphone manufacturer, but consumers in China and India seem to be quite interesting in their products.

The Chinese handset maker, Gionee , seem to be heading in the direction to set a new trend and it is apparent from its new launch. Gionee has come up with a new clamshell Android smartphone , which boasts of advanced features like fingerprint scanner. The handset has been slated for a launch later this month and the world is waiting with a baited breath for this one. It seems that the flip phones are going to make a comeback circa Samsung Galaxy Gold and Gionee W909. Here is a brief overview of the handset for those interested in the handset.. As already mentioned, the highlight of the handset is its clamshell form factor, which is unheard of in the Android smartphone market. The handset will therefore feature two displays, on the outer panel and one inside for the convenience of its user. It is to be expected that the device will come flaunting a fingerprint scanner on the sides. Also, the brand is more likely to have designed the device with a metallic chassis, thus making it a premium looking smartphone.. Both inner and outer display of the handset are expected to be small at just 4.2-inches, which is just barely ideal for anything multimedia and gaming. The display of the handset is expected to feature an HD resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels to make for a beautiful display clarity.. The performance offered by this handset is bound to be good as it comes with a powerful 1.8 GHz Octa-core processor. The processor of the handset is further accompanied by a massive 4 GB of RAM for enhanced smoothness and animations. However, details regarding its battery is not known yet.. The rear panel f this handset is home to a powerful 16 MP camera with a single LED flash, which is only found on high end flagship smartphones. Gionee has also kept the user interface of the camera quite simple for better focus on photography. On its front panel, there is a 5 MP camera module for those who like to click selfies.. The new handset is a single SIM smartphone that boasts of both 4G LTE and 3G bandwidth for a good Internet and browsing speed. It also offers other connectivity options like Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, microUSB and GPS.. Gionee is trying to chart a new terrain with W909, which is to bring back the clamshell handsets in vogue and it seems that W909 can definitely live upto the task. With dual display, fingerprint scanner, powerful processor and massive 4 GB of RAM , this is one handset to look out for.. 43,990 (Expected Price) Gionee W909 is currently not available in any online store..

I have recently aquired a Gionee W909 from China,. Since this phone is currently only available in China, the stock rom AmigoOS sv1.2 is the only rom I can find for it. and its based on lollipop 5.1. The phone comes without any gapps at all. Since I am using this in North America, I need all the gapps installed. Kingroot works on this phone, so my phone is rooted with kingroot, trying to install gapp. I have googled a few articles saying install google framework, login service, play service, and then install vending in system/app via RE, and then install play store. all the methods relating to downloading the service/framework apk, and then putting vending in system, have all failed catastrophically. all of these ends up with a "service" has stopped working, and "com.google.process.gapps has stopped", i've tried installing everything in system/app, or some in system/app, always made sure chmod is rw r r, and nothing worked. I have also been trying to flash tk gapps and open gapps, downloaded ver 5.1 tried both 32 bit and 64bit. The stock recovery menu has an option to flash a zip onto it, it just doesnt read the tk gapps or the open gapps, the installation always terminate after a few seconds. so i wanted to flash a twrp or a cwm recovery onto it, but there isnt one made for this phone yet, so i found another gionee phone, gn9007's twrp recovery which was on a chinese site, and tried to flash that in with its own one click flashing software. Which seemed to me that boot loader is locked. so I installed drivers and adb and fastboot. when i tried fastboot oem unlock, the phone did prompt me and ask me if i wanted to unlock bootloader, and i pressed volume up/yes, and it gives me an error saying unlock operation is not allowed. none of the other flash oem commands work, such as flash oem device-info or flash oem get_identifier_token or get_unlock_data. so now im stuck trying to install gapps on this phone. today i tried using flashfire to flash the gapps zip file, and it didnt work, flashfire just stayed black screen for hours, even though the phone is rooted, theres no twrp or cwm made for it, is there any other way? I have also tried google installer made for MIUI, and ended up with service has stopped working, and com.google.process.gapps has stopped.

I really want to buy this phone, just need those gapps.. Join Date: Joined: Sep 2012. My Devices: Sony Ericsson Xperia Play. i am interested in getting the same phone as well. but waiting till you, or someone else finds a solution to the Gapps Problem. the solution would be simple enough i guess, but needs a Dev to work a bit on it. i would like to ask a few questions to you though about the phone. If your phone is rooted, have you as a temporary fix tried connecting your phone as USB and downloaded apk files from the internet and installing manually ??. i have the Lenovo a588t flip phone and the selfie camera when the flip is open is inverted in all the apps example SnapChat/Instagram/Skype etc.. is it the same with the Gionee W909 phone as well. is 4G working well on your phone ?. How often do you need to open the flip or everything works well from outer screen only. are u able to run Dual Whatsapp and Dual apps for both the sims or only 1 app for the phone. and anything interesting about the phone also you can state.. while i try to look for someone who can help fix this problem. EDIT1 :: this was the link we followed to convert our phone rom (Lenovo a588t android 4.4) to a rooted rom and also create a CWM recovery for the phone. im sure this might lead you somewhere. as its for MTK related phones. EDIT2 :: try looking for a phone with a similar MTK chipset and try to install GAPPS on your phone that way. EDIT3 :: Atleast you can upload ur downloaded ROM on needrom .com so others can avail benefit of it ?? lol. Join Date: Joined: Jan 2012. I bought a w909, it just arrived this morning. The seller made sure I knew gapps wouldn't work on it, but I'm fairly comfortable with following online steps to flash firmware (have done it in the past with Motorola Droid versions). So I'm thinking it shouldn't be too difficult once someone figures out how to bypass the Chinese googlewall. It was quick and easy to root with Kingo. I'd be fine with a Cyanogen mod too! Subscribing to this thread for updates on whether anyone has managed to successfully install working gapps. Honestly I'd be fine without the Play store, just want gmail, calendar, etc..

Join Date: Joined: Jan 2012. I bought it from liaow dot com and the manager of that site was the most helpful and informative person I have EVER bought from. Most reassuring online buying experience I have ever had. The price wasn't the lowest I'd see across the internet, but it was fairly close... lower than Ebay and Aliexpress at least. If your phone is rooted, have you as a temporary fix tried connecting your phone as USB and downloaded apk files from the internet and installing manually ??. I tested installing the gapps apk just to confirm that it wouldn't work (it didn't). But manual install of a 3rd party appmarket .apk worked great, no issues. i have the Lenovo a588t flip phone and the selfie camera when the flip is open is inverted in all the apps example SnapChat/Instagram/Skype etc.. is it the same with the Gionee W909 phone as well. I haven't tried any of these yet but I haven't had any inversion on the inner screen. is 4G working well on your phone ?. I haven't tested a SIM card in it yet. I don't plan to until I can flash the ROM to something that will allow installation of gapps. How often do you need to open the flip or everything works well from outer screen only. You could get by without opening the flip phone at all. Everything works from the touchscreen and side hardware buttons. But flipping it open is pretty awesome for the physical camera button on the keypad and for dialing. are u able to run Dual Whatsapp and Dual apps for both the sims or only 1 app for the phone. and anything interesting about the phone also you can state.. while i try to look for someone who can help fix this problem. The stock apps are not great. Particularly the embedded browser is bad... it's got the Great Firewall built in (google 404s). Long shot is this phone will be AMAZING once it can be flashed with gapps. Until that time, it's not great.. i am interested in getting the same phone as well. but waiting till you, or someone else finds a solution to the Gapps Problem. the solution would be simple enough i guess, but needs a Dev to work a bit on it. i would like to ask a few questions to you though about the phone.

Hey and congrats on this amazing phone. where did u buy it from and for how much. can u please try to answer the above questions i have asked about the phone so i can make up my mind to get the phone.. Join Date: Joined: Sep 2012. My Devices: Sony Ericsson Xperia Play. any update on the phone usage.. what about Gapps ?? any luck on that. Join Date: Joined: Jan 2012. The worst thing was, I rooted the device, then was playing around with it and tried to install the OTA firmware update. I have had no success even finding a Gionee representative whom I can ask for a new ROM, in English. I tried getting some support at Hovatek paid forum, but to no success. It's hard to get Windows to recognize the device and use the MTK drivers required to allow MTK Droid Tools or other flashing tools to work with it. The support at Hovatek was getting pretty frustrated with me, and was looking for a ROM and not finding one.. any update on the phone usage.. what about Gapps ?? any luck on that.

Translate from Chinese to English the link www.amigo.cn. and go to firmware downloads and select your mobile.. im sure you need to register somewhere (no need to register i checked) .. but thats for you to do.. im not sure if the downloads are OTA updates or full ROMS as of now.. but 1.6GB of data should be a ROM. they have to be installed as a zip file from the SD Card.. Entering recovery is also mentioned in the Tutorial Link on the page. Edit/ you will also find the drivers etc for your model..
