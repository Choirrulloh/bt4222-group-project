Software Package Compels Smooth User Experience:. 13 MP Front Camera and Upgraded Selfie Cam:. Lenovo K5 Note is the next-gen offering looking to follow up from where the previous Vibe K4 Note left off. Also known as the Vibe K5 Note, it released in 2016 in limited markets and looks to hit the stores throughout the world within the upcoming month or so.. Lenovo has made quite a handsome share in the smartphone or rather, mobile device market over the past few years with a slew of strong products at an affordable price. But what their entry into the smartphone segment made it a success story is the sheer strength of their features.. Lenovo K5 Note comes in as an upgrade over the previous K4 iteration. And there are many upgrades to talk about. This is already rated as one of the better devices in this mid-ranging segment. And there are quite a few reasons behind that too.. Style comes together with utility with this Lenovo K5 Note. This is a completely metal body with above average dimensions coming in at 152 x 75.7 x 8.5 mm (5.98x2.98x0.33 inches) and with quite a hefty battery. But it still manages to weigh in at just 165 grams. A curved rear end with a matte finish is firm to grip and quite premium to touch. Still experts recommend a mobile case.. Lenovo K5 Note runs a Mediatek MT6755 Helio P10 chipset running on an Octa-core processor (Core Structure - Quad-Core GHz Cortex-A53 and Quad Core Cortex-A53). Maximum processing speeds of this device come in at around 1.8 GHz. A dedicated Mali-T860MP2 is integrated with this setup.. And there are two RAM configurations available in this model, separate 3 GB and 4 GB configurations. Antutu benchmarks for the 4 GB Lenovo Vibe K5 Note comes in at around 49442.. Lenovo K5 Note has a 1080p display with a native resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels with a strong 401 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) display. Ultra slim bezels, as has become the standard for high-end smartphones, put this display in the top bracket for sharing a strong 72.5% size ratio with the body.. Sharp colors, hue and saturation give buyers real-life like images with accurate presentation. It's a definite upgrade over multiple features such as better viewing angle and image degree.. An Android 5.1 Lollipop runs this Lenovo K5 Note, which is also likely to add an Android version 6.0 Marshmallow just that soon. It comes added with the latest version of Vibe UI with more intuitive accessibility add-ons.. As is a continuous trend, it comes with a more powerful 8 MP camera with an increased shot angle. Better unspecified aperture tech can be observed as it performs much better than what buyers might expect.. The primary front camera, the 13 MP ISOCELL shooter found in K4's, continues in this model with minimal changes. This is the model which will be found in this K5 Note. This is one feature where buyers would rather enjoy unchanged.. Settings and filters include among others Triaxial leveling which makes this quite a rare high-end module. But buyers would've been better off with an improvement in its f/2.2 aperture as low light images continue to be on the weaker side of things.. Lenovo K5 Note is powered by a 3500 mAh battery. Run-times for this device is expected to come in at around 27 hours 3G device.. Lenovo K5 Note will make an overnight release in the Philippines which has come up as one of the more important markets in the world. This upgraded K4 Note rates in at an average 5th among all mid-ranging devices. But it is a fact that it comes with an upgraded performance and better front camera. Comparing its price tag, the models above it in benchmarks such as Antutu, Vellamo Metal and Single-Core scores such as Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro or LeTV Le 2, come with a much higher price tag..

Top 10 4G Mobiles Below 15000. Review talking about - Read all Great camera Reviews. BASED ON 133,048 RATING(S). 22 Nov 2016 By Nayana Ramachandran On flipkart.com. Good phone; competitive price; HARDWARE issues BAD service. Short description: Great phone, great price, but be prepared to face touch-screen/hardware issues and a lousy customer service as well. :-(nnPhone (4 stars):na) The phone looks fabulous. It's got some nice features too - lot of internal space, 4 GB RAM, fingerprint sensor, VR compatibility, etc.nb) For the first couple of weeks, I didn't observe any issues with the phone, but after that there were severe touch-screen issues (explained below).nnHardware (2 stars): Looks like Lenovo have compromised heavily on hardware configuration.na) Turns out that the processor is cheap - hence they are able to sell the phone at low cost.nb) The touch screen went haywire after 2 months of use - screens moving rapidly; random apps being clicked; etc.nc) Basically, the touch screen sensors were detecting touch from various random parts of the screen simultaneously and continuously; hence the erratic behavior.nd) I ran some antivirus/malware detection apps and didn't find any viruses/malware. The service centre confirmed that this was a hardware issue and the touch panel needed to be replaced.nnService (0 stars): Lenovo service is the lousiest I have come across!na) First of all, you'll have trouble finding an authorized Lenovo service centre for mobiles, because there are just one or two per city (note: the service centres for laptops and mobiles are different).nb) Moreover, most service centres don't pick up calls ever (ref: Lenovo representative at Pimpri service centre).nc) Lastly, they'll try their best to get the customer to pay for hardware again (they quoted Rs 3900 to change top panel including touchscreen), even if the phone is in warranty and is not damaged or tampered.nnHope this helps.. 28 Oct 2016 By SURENDRA KUMAR MEENA On flipkart.com. I wont talk much about the specifications as it is already clearly mentioned on flipkart. I will share only my experience with this device.nnI am using the phone from last 1 and half month. Will break down my review in 3 parts. The pros, cons and what more could be done.nFirst let's see the pros that make it the best value for money phone currently in the market.nn* Battery : easily getting around 6 hours of screen on time. Battery is an issue with smartphones today. This phone is just a beast. It easily get overs a full day with quite heavy usage.nn* Screen Quality: easily one of the best screen we can find in the market at this price point. Very vibrant crisp and colours seems very bright. There is some kind of protection on the screen making it smudge free.nn*Build Quality: nothing sort of amazing. The metal body feels sturdy and give a premium feel. The phone is also very light weight and looks great.nn* Fingerprint Scanner: the scanner is blazing fast. The position is perfect for using your index finger to unlock. I tried it using 5 different fingers it without any hiccup.nn* processor: the Helio P10 64- bit is not the latest but is very smooth and amazingly powerful. I was bit sceptical about it at the beginning, but am really blown up by the processing speed and it's power handling whatever thrown at it. Heating is comparatively very minimal.nn* Clear voice calls: this is a neglected aspect but K 5 note has done a great job here. The calls are crystal clear without any distortion. VoLTE is an added functionality that is the future of the mobile networks soon. So you can be future proof with the device.nn*Heavy gaming: not an issue with the fast professor and ample RAM of 4GB. Can play any graphic intensive game easily. Also the device doesn't get heated up to an uncomfortable level. So that is a plus.nn* Sound quality speaker and headphones: the speaker is satisfactory. Theatermax technology with Dolby Atoms system makes it totally different from the other phones. The sound through headphones are really amazing and crisp. Use good quality headphones, I use sennheisers gives a great output. Love the sound output through the headphones.n*Sensors: all major sensors present in the device.nnSshhhuu. Let's check out the cons now.nn* Charging time: there is fast charge 1. But sadly that is not fast compared to today's standards where many devices are coming around with fast charge option. The battery is huge so it would really take a long 2 to 3 hours to charge from 0-100%.n* Camera: The Camera in this segment is one of the best (except Mogo G Camera). The Quality is great in ample lighting conditions. But little bit struggle in low light and complex lighting conditions. LED flash gives a better exposed picture in darkness. Hope it gets a little better with software updates. That can be done and it is also expected as the sensor is quite good.n* No water resistance: yeah that is a must now a days owing to the changing trends in the smartphones usage. You can live without it but it's good to have it .n*Still this cons doesn't take away the crown of best value for money smartphone in the market at present.nnI would like to make a special mention here about system lack which i am facing after getting OTA Volte update, Some times android systems stops working during gaming and even during the calls which needs to be addressed by the lenovo team. that's the main reason I have given only 4 stars to this phone.nnWhat Lenovo can improve in the device.n* Make the camera performance a little better especially in low light conditions. Hope that is coming soon in the next updates.n* Add functionality like scrolling, shutter button and app lock option to the Fingerprint Scanner and we can expect that very soon in the next updates. That is very handy and useful.n*Improve the RAM management.nLenovo should address the issue of above mentioned system lack during the calls and gaming which has occurred only after Volte update.nnSorry I guess I took a lot of time..nnHope the review is helpful. If you find it helpful rate it as helpful. That is appreciated.nnWish everyone happy Diwali. Lenovo Vibe K5 Note with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage launched for Rs 13,499. Feb 20 2017 By Akshay Kumar.

News Lenovo K5 Note vs Lenovo K4 Note: What's different. Lenovo K5 Note vs Lenovo K4 Note: What's different. Updated: January 26, 2016 10:22 AM IST. Lenovo launched the K4 Note in India earlier this month, which is available on Amazon India for Rs 11,999. Barely four weeks later, Lenovo has launched the K5 Note in China, priced at 1,099 Yuan (Rs 11,300 approximately). On the face of it, the K5 Note looks but an incremental upgrade over its predecessor, and it is a tad surprising that Lenovo launched the new phablet at such a short gap. We nonetheless pit the two phablets in a comparison to see how they differ.. One of the major differentiating factors is in the build quality. Where the K4 Note boasts a removable plastic back panel, the K5 Note features an all-metal body. With this tweak in design, the K5 Note features dimensions of 152×75.7×8.49mm, making it shorter, and slimmer than its predecessor (153.6×76.5×9.2mm).. Specifications : Both phablets flaunt 5.5-inch screens at full HD (1920×1080 pixels) resolution. Under the hood though, the K5 Note features a 1.8GHz MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core 64-bit processor paired with 2GB of RAM, while the K4 Note features MediaTek MT6753 octa-core 64-bit processor paired with 3GB of RAM.. On the storage front, it is all square with both phablets featuring 16GB internal storage that can be further expanded using a microSD card. As for the photographic chops, both feature 13-megapixel snappers at the back with dual-LED flash and PDAF support. Up front however, the K5 Note features an 8-megapixel snapper, as opposed to the 5-megapixel selfie snapper on the K4 Note.. The K5 Note also features a slightly bigger 3,500mAh battery with fast charging support. The K4 Note, on the other hand, features a 3,300mAh battery with fast charging capabilities.. On the software front, both Lenovo phablets run on Android Lollipop wrapped under the Vibe UI.. Features : Both feature the usual bevy of connectivity options like dual-SIM card slots, 4G LTE support, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The K4 Note has an added advantage of NFC support, while the K5 Note is future proof with support for VoLTE. Both also feature a fingerprint scanner placed at the back, and 1.5W speakers with Dolby ATMOS support.. On paper there is not a lot that differentiates Lenovo’s two new phablets. The K5 Note has the advantage of an all-metal body, 8-megapixel selfie camera, bigger battery, and VoLTE support. It will be interesting to see if Lenovo plans on bringing the K5 Note to India. If it does, the question is when and what would then be the fate of the recently launched K4 Note.. Android 5.1 Lollipop wrapped under Vibe UI. Mediatek Helio P10 SoC with 64-bit,1.8GHz octa-core processor. 13 MP with LED flash, auto-focus. Published Date: January 25, 2016 4:32 PM IST. Updated Date: January 26, 2016 10:22 AM IST.

I bought this on First sale and i used almost 13 days. So far there are no hanging, heating, lagging issues. Theatre Max is a great experience especially 3D movies with VR Headset. Battery is coming one and half day in normal use. Front Cam takes good pictures where as rear cam was not upto the mark.. Low light photography is a little bad. It has only one slot where you can use one sim and one Sd card or two sims at a time. This was not mentioned any where at the time of first sale. Display is good, Contact name sige are restricted to 10 letters. We can not store a name more than 10 letters. We have to note in short. This is not there in previous versions K3note. Audio is good but not provided earphones. Need to buy for extra cost. So far it has given overall good performance.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 8 out of 8 people found this review helpful. By Sohith Reddy | 29 Mar 2017. it lasts for 1/2 day.tHE phone is so good but it runs on android 6.0. I didn't get any update to 7.1 nougat version. I think at this price range it is suitable and i think u should alot dual apps feature. but coolpad at this price bracket coolpad note 5 is there even better than this. coolpad note 5 is 4010 mah battery where as 4500 mah. whereas lenovo is 3gb ram.i think u must upgrade.............

I bought Lenovo Vibe K5 note mobile from Flipkart.. after 10days "Battery Temperature too Low " error & Charging not happened".. Flipkart after sales service was very worst..They said cannot replace it refund after 10days..Worst Customer service... Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. By Ankan Debgupta | 26 Aug 2017. Having used the phone for the last 3 months...No problem whatsoever. Pretty powerful handset in this price range. Charges pretty fast ,though no fast chargeing ability is mentioned. Selfie freaks would be fine by the day,not so sure about night conditions. Sturdy body,feels solid to the hands. Graphics optimum for high end games,played almost all high end games. Sound is terrific,which I didnot expect to be honest,very crisp and clear. No earphones out of the box though. Battery goes on for almost a day with heavy usage,and I mean heavy .. Not sure if any security update will be provided for this handset. No IR blaster,so no changing tv channels and AC power.. Within this budget range highly recommended... Was this review helpful? Yes No. Flipkart Sale Cuts Lenovo Vibe K5 Note Price by Rs.

Metal unibody design Fingerprint sensor 4G LTE support Full HD display Capacious battery. It's time for a true review! It's a really awesome smartphone!. Audio 4GB RAM! Performance Screen (1080p) Looks are reqlly awesome! Price is affordable For me BETTER THAN THE REDMI NOTE 4 Enough Memory is a available (26GB). Option between 2nd SIM and MicroSD Camera focus is slow The VIBE UI isn't really great but you get the classic theme as well which seems easy to use.. buy a lenovo k5 note 4 gb ram and 32 gb rom. dt.9-7-17 goes to 9 day of use. My advice is go for it. Ram Fornt camera Osm sound Speed No hanging problem Looks smart Btry backup perfect uses 1 day Also sensor fast or mi phone and moto phone's Supported Vo LTE Smoothly tuch No heating problem Supported output tv with cast screen No lags in games upto 2.5gb Smooth performance without any settings in psp emulator. Littlebit about rear camera in low light. But 13 MP camera is enough for normal usage. Battery is perfect use as one day but should be around 4000 to 5000 mAH ! Than use to 2 and 3 days No fast charging full charjing complete time 2 and 3 hour use one time 1sim with memory card OR 2 Sim with not use memory card. so use otg cable as a recuriment. Not a direct video call use app to video call imo. SUPERB MOBILE...ITS A BEAST!!!GO FOR IT. I've been using this mobile from last 3 months.Iam satisfied with the experience..
