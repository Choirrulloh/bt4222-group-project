Amazing speed, unbelievable video quality, & great looks in low price. 1 GB RAM is more than enough for KITKAT 4.4. Battery life extends up to 2 days after Power Management get start. Power management app/service is inbuilt in this phone. Only the thing is it gets hot after playing heavy game, but it’s normal. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Not what I expected!!!!!!. Previously I have been using a Xolo Q600, and believe me- the former's quad core processor is almost the same as this one's octa-core. I'm quite disappointed with this mobile. Charging takes a lot of time (full charge takes about 3 hrs from 0 to 100%). Plus the battery drains very quickly. At least 3000 mAh was required for this type of mobile. Another irritating fact is that the phone lags a few times while starting a game, which is quite shocking for an octa core. And lastly, the fact which I hate the most- the phone gets heated up while playing certain games. At first I thought this was happening for playing large games like Asphalt 8, but it happens every time while playing any game of size greater than 100 MB. Also the sound quality of the loud speaker is not good and quite low. My Xolo Q600 was far better than this one. I gave this a 3 star for the specifications only; as performance-wise, it deserves only 2.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars truly value for Money. Its such a nice phone Brilliant in looks and performance And the speed is good too Battery and camera are also Fantastic..

Mobiles / XOLO Mobile Phones / XOLO Omega 5.5 Price in India. User Visits: 140 Launch Date in India: 20 December, 2014 Compare. The budget phablet market is a niche some Indian players have tried tapping into and Xolo happens to have joined them just in time to make a mark using its new smartphone range. With Omega range, Xolo is trying to make a mark with a new gimmick called HIVE user interface and the Omega 5.5 is aiming to conquer the budget phablet niche. Will Xolo be able to capitalise using the omega 5.5 and its HIVE UI trick? Spec talk. The Xolo Omega 5.5 runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat, which has been skinned with HIVE UI, and also has dual-SIM support. A 1.4GHz octa-core processor with 1GB RAM can be found on the Omega 5.5. A 5.5-inch screen does duties on the Xolo Omega 5.5 and it puts out display resolution of 1280x720 pixels. A 13-megapixel camera on the back and a 2-megapixel shooter up front can be spotted on the Omega 5.5. There is 8GB internal storage provided on the Xolo Omega 5.5 and it can be expanded up to 32GB using a microSD card. A 2600mAh battery can be found powering the Omega 5.5 but no performance ratings are available for the same. The question of buying a Xolo smartphone requires a careful thought, the reason being Xolo's history and its transformation into a force to be reckoned with in the smartphone market. However, the Omega range shows a lot of promise for Xolo's future and the HIVE UI trick is a pretty neat one and has not changed the look of the stock Android OS much. Instead, it has given Xolo a gimmick to rely on and a change that might just give it an upper hand over the rest of its rivals, be they from India or abroad. How will that translate into big numbers for Xolo would be interesting to watch out for and we will be doing exactly the same. The Xolo Omega 5.5 gets two thumbs-up from us..

Xolo Omega 5.5: A Worthy Competitor at an Affordable Tick. Xolo is one sincere company which has been focusing upon the expansive domestic market without usually going up in the budget segment. Be it the latest technology or the affordable handsets, Xolo is something which never ditches any competition while being pretty aggressive about the marketing strategies. The latest entrant is the Omega 5.5 which certainly belongs to the given class of Smartphones of which Xolo can be proud of. Be it the minutest of aesthetic nuances or certain hard-hitting features, the pricing does justify the way we look into the specs sheet. The Omega 5.5 from Xolo is no pushover and can compete with any international brand as for the affordability and even the included feature sets.. Pros: The screen size is pretty big and involves a lot of technological prowess into the mix. The display is quite crisp whereas the involvement of a pretty impactful camera is something which the customers might find interesting. Inclusion of a dedicated UI is something different and path breaking in terms of the domestic market.. Cons: Battery support isn’t great whereas the pixel density is certainly on the lower side. Internal memory support s pretty bleak while we expected the company to put in a bit more RAM.. The Xolo Omega 5.5 has a lot in store in terms of specs and features whereas this review would certainly fit into the varied user plans as we do into the minutest of details concerning this handset and the myriad options it is to provide.. The Omega 5.5 is certainly in sync with the latest design cues and innovative strategies. What stands out from the images is the inclination of the company towards the curved rear and the rounded edges which do look pretty good in terms of avoiding overall clutter. Be it the perfect arrangement of the physical keys or the availability of multiple ports and jacks, the Omega 5.5 is certainly one of the better looking gadgets to have made the cut. The best part still remains to the metallic linings or undertones which fit in perfectly with the budget whereas the entire look gets a refreshing makeover.. The layout is pretty sizeable as with the 5.5 inch screen which is certainly a better aspect associated with the gadget. The layout again is HD which adds a lot to the overall vibrancy associated with the gadget. The offered resolution stands tall at 720p whereas the color combinations are available in plenty as well. The actual pixel density hasn’t been given away as of yet but it seems to be on the lower side which might lead to a dull screen whereas the IPS panel fits into the scheme rather perfectly. The in plane switching technology has a lot to offer in tweaking the viewing angles rather seamless and the gadget looks pretty vibrant even when viewed across multiple orientations.. The platform looks pretty exhaustive in terms of intuitiveness added along. The KitKat v4.4 is on offer pertaining to the android OS whereas the Hive UI fits in pretty perfectly with the OS in hand. The perks involved range from better launcher to the availability of certain customizable options doing domestic rounds. Be it the innovative applications or awe inspiring widgets, this UI fits in perfectly with all the user requirements while providing the best possible viewing experience.. We are looking at a MediaTek chipset but of a different make as with the MT6592M. The chipset leads the way for the Octa-Core processor which is certainly a catch at the given price range. Offered clock speed is set at 1.4GHz which is certainly one of the more significant aspects pertaining to the gadget.. The RAM support extends up to a sizeable 1GB which fits in perfectly with the processor and the 8 cores in action. The internal memory allotment is set at 8GB whereas one can easily expand the same to a sizeable 32GB on adding the micro-SD card .. The rear camera features one 13MP module backed up by the Sony Exmor RS Sensor technology whereas the front snapper is fixed at 2MP to be precise. Be it the LED flashlight or the full HD recording schemes, the Omega 5.5 boasts of a great rear camera to bank upon.. At 2600mAh the battery unit is mere average and multiple connectivity features to drain a lot as for the 3G, Bluetooth and other specs included..

Description for Xolo Omega 5.0 (Black). The XOLO Omega 5.0 looks like a well-made smartphone, though nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to design. It has a pretty bland look, with a black plastic finishing coupled with a metallic silver trim running along the edges. We have the power and the volume rocker keys housed within these metallic strips, with the power button on the right and the volume rockers on the left. The bottom of the device is empty as both the micro-USB port and 3.5 mm headset jacks are housed on top. Meanwhile, the three capacitive physical buttons are located below the display, which are not backlit but would suffice in low light conditions as the icons are shiny enough..

Mobiles / XOLO Mobile Phones / XOLO Omega 5.0 Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 14 Launch Date in India: 20 December, 2014 Compare. Can you recall a smartphone maker from India which is trying to make a difference and does not command resources like Micromax? If not, we will give you a hint - HIVE. If you still can not recall, we are talking about Xolo and its effort to give users a new experience. Xolo had made the announcement a while back that it was working on HIVE user interface and would roll it out on its new range of devices soon. Here we are, with Xolo Omega 5.0 with HIVE UI. The Xolo Omega 5.0 runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat skinned with HIVE user interface and also sports dual-SIM capability. The Omega 5.0 sports a 1.4GHz octa-core processor along with 1GB RAM to keep the phone up to speed while you handle multiple tasks. There is 8GB inbuilt storage on the Xolo Omega 5.0 and it can be expanded further up to 32GB using a microSD card. The Omega 5.0 sports a 5-inch screen that puts out display resolution of 1280x720 pixels. Speaking of optics, the Xolo Omega 5.0 sports an 8-megapixel rear camera accompanied by a 2-megapixel front camera. To power all the hardware, the Omega 5.0 has a 2100mAh battery onboard but no performance ratings are available for the same. Xolo has come up with some amazing smartphones, the last one being confused as an Android One device. This time, Xolo has gone for something different yet again with the Omega 5.0. The highlight of this smartphone is the HIVE UI and that is what we have been talking about since the beginning. It lends the stock Android 4.4.2 KitKat decent look and feel. The transitions are smooth and a bit different from the stock Android OS as well. However, depending on your taste for stock or skinned Android OS, you may come to like the Omega 5.0 or hate it. However, when it comes down to purchasing it, the Xolo Omega 5.0 feels like a solid package and is worthy of being considered when purchasing a smartphone..
