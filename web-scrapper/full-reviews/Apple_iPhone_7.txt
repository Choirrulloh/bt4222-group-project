Good Stuff Good 12MP camera with OIS First iPhone to feature water and dust resistance Stereo speakers Extremely powerful & efficient quad-core Apple A10 Fusion chipset 7MP secondary camera Outstanding battery backup performance Bad Stuff Dual-camera setup is absent No 3.5mm audio jack Wired music listening, and charging at the same time is not possible. The new generation Apple iPhones always bring with them a host of new features that makes them the most technological advanced smartphones devices in the market. The Apple iPhone 7 intends to do the same, starting with its IP67 rated water and dust resistant all-aluminium metal body that makes sure that dust and rain don't stop you from doing things on your iPhone 7. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the iPhone devices to feature water and dust resistance.. The home button which doubles as a fingerprint scanner on the iPhone is now force-touch based button, meaning it does not press inside. Instead, it gives a sense of tap with the help of haptic engine which is a vibration motor.. The only disadvantage some may find is the omission of the 3.5mm audio jack, Apple iPhone 7 now uses the lightening connector to power the headphones, although Apple is providing lightening to 3.5mm connector with the device.. Talking about the new colour variants, the Apple iPhone 7 now comes in two more colour options jet black and black while older colour variants like silver, gold and rose gold are still present.. 4.7-inch Retina Display With Wider Colour-Gamut.

The 3D touch display further extends the usability and convenience by providing with multiple options and drop down menus based on the pressure applied to the screen.. The Apple iPhone 7 is the first non-plus variant of iPhone to feature OIS (optical image stabilisation) in the primary camera; it was a much-awaited feature in the iPhone. The OIS is helpful in a plentiful of scenarios, such as it corrects the shakes caused by the user while taking image and video, it helps in letting more light into the camera sensor that results in brighter photos in the low-light conditions and much more. The 12MP primary camera now also features dual-tone quad-LED flash which has two more LED’s than its predecessor that will result in 50% more light and it can cover 50% more distance. The surprising update to the iPhone 7 is the bump in the resolution of the secondary camera to 7MP from the 5MP on the iPhone 6s. The 7MP selfie camera now yields sharper, brighter and more detailed images..

Apart from that the iOS 10 comes loaded with plenty of features added to iMessage, Maps, search and camera.. The excellent software is driven with the help of Apple A10 Fusion chipset that now comes with quad-core configuration. The two cores among the four are high-performance cores which will only be working during heavy tasks and games while the other two cores are power-efficient cores that will take care of basic multitasking like calling and messaging. Apple promises 40% faster performance than the Apple A9 chipset found in its predecessor.. Talking about the battery backup, Apple promises 2 hours of increased web-browsing and video playback time compared to the iPhone 6s, while the standby time and the talk time remain the same. Note that the battery backup for video playback time, talk time, and music playback time are rated while using the Apple’s wireless AirPod earphones..

Please ask the question in above box. Does it have an inbuilt GarageBand app?. No, it doesn't have inbuilt GarageBand app.. How to use two sims and a memory card in this phone?. Unfortunately you can not use two SIM cards or a memory card with the iPhone 7. Apple does not offer dual SIM card slot or a memory card slot. That said, Apple is indeed working on a SIM solution that will allow using two mobile numbers with just one SIM card. The company has filed for a patent last December of working on such a solution. As of now, there is no timeline to expect it to be included in the coming iPhone model.. Can't use two sims and memory card because it has no slots for this.. You cannot use it as there is no dual SIM slot.. This is not a dual SIM phone.. Is it comfortable to hold in hands or is it slippery?. The phone is very comfortable to handle, not slippery. However, in case you choose to buy a back cover, then it won't matter much.. Which one is is good Google pixel or iPhone 7?. The Pixel might be overpriced for the brand, but it has a better camera. It's also by far the smoothest Android experience on offer. The iPhone has better design and build quality, and iOS on a whole has a better app ecosystem than Android. At the end of the day, it depends on which one of these parameters do you value the most.. Google Pixel has better camera and its Google Assistant is way better than Siri. But, if you see long term performance you should go with iPhone 7. If you have a used iPhone before and you want a change, then you can try Google Pixel.. Both are good.Google pixel for the best software,camera,best android experience.Iphone for best hardware,design, simplicity.. Is 32GB sufficient to use and what is the available storage limit of this phone?. In case you do not upload a lot of songs on your device, it should suffice your requirement!.

Experts have been constantly speculating about the features of this flagship smartphone from a long time from any update or rumor they came to hear. Based on such rumors and updates we have penned down this write up features all the speculations, rumors, specifications and aspects of this smartphone. The first model of every series of iPhone comes with major updates. Therefore, it is expected that iPhone 7 is going to follow suit and entice the world with its cool updates. Here are the speculated features of iPhone 7 that is going to make one of the best in the global market:. iPhone 7 (Gold, Silver, Rose Gold).

Traveling back time, we can see that since 2013 Apple has been releasing its product in the month of September. iPhone 5c and 5s were launched on 10 September(2013), iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were launched on 9 th September(2014) and iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were launched on 9 September, 2015. Therefore, we are expecting Apple to maintain this tradition next year as well. However, our close observation reveals that Apple prefers launching their product on Tuesdays. So the most probable days for releasing Apple’s phone will be either 6 th or 13 th September, 2016. And thereafter it will be released globally by the end of the month.. On the other hand, there are also rumors that Apple is going to launch. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7s in two different dates. This decision might have been taken to deal with the global competition. So we can expect iPhone 7 in coming spring and iPhone 7s in the next autumn. If these phones are not released simultaneously, then we are not expecting some major updates to be included in the two phones. However, these are mere speculations and we are not really sure about it. So mark the date for iPhone 7 Release date.. According to the latest update iPhone 7 is going to be integrated with hexa core A10 processor which is going to boost the performance of the gadget by manifold times. The iPhone 6s model is powered by a dual core processor and the flagship smartphones from other brands is integrated with quad core processor. Therefore, whether or not iPhone 7 is going to come with a hexa core processor is a big question to us. If it turns out to be true, then Apple is definitely going to create a bench mark in terms of the processor.. Along with upgraded processor, we are also expecting iPhone 7 to come with better RAM. The iPhone 7 is rumored to be incorporated with 3GB RAM to support the high end processor. However, some of the experts of the opinion that 3GB RAM will be present in only the iPhone 7 Plus model as it features the dual camera for processing image. We feel that iPhone 7 is definitely going to come with a better processor than its predecessor. If not a hexa core processor, a quad core processor is definitely on its way in iPhone 7 which will be comfortably supported by 2GB RAM.. iPhone 7 is going to be powered by iOS 11 which is coming with some tremendous updates like an improvised Siri that will be synced with the third party apps as well and some other updates.. We have been expecting an iPhone with edge to edge display from a long time and though our expectation has not been met still now, but we are keeping our hopes high even this time. Recently, a patent was submitted which showed a display with bumpers at the four edges. This will protect the screen from getting cracked if it accidentally falls off your hand. However, Apple keeps submitting different kinds of patents which are not in use still now, so whether this is going to be realized this time or not, we are not sure. 3D Touch feature which was present in its predecessors will be present in iPhone 7 as well and might be with additional features.. The two variants of iPhone 7 are going to come with screen measuring about 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch and sharper screen resolution of 1080p. There are also rumors that iPhone 7 is going to come with OLED display instead of the LCD display which is gathered from an update by the supply chain source.. Moreover, chances are there iPhone 7 and 7s will be made with a more durable material that will ensure that the phone has a stronger built. We were expecting iPhone 6 display to be made from sapphire glass, unfortunately we didn’t get to see that. So we would be happy to see a stronger and more durable sapphire glass display in the next generation iPhone.. There are rumors that Apple is going to do away with the home button in the next generation phone. This will help in making the screen bigger in size. However, iPhone 6s Touch ID is integrated in the home button of the phone, therefore removing it would mean that the touch id needs to be moved to either side of the phone or on the screen itself. Apple has lately submitted a patent were the touch id was present in the screen of the phone, so chances of our prediction turning into reality is high. check all information about iPad Mini 5. iPhone 7 series might come with a non metal body. The possible alternatives are ceramics, plastics or liquid metal. But what it will be, we are not sure. However, we must say that the metal body iPhone 6s looks really chic and we would be happy to see a redesigning of the phone with the same metal.. Every year Apple submits thousands of patents and 2015 is no exception. Lately it has submitted a wrap around display with a curved screen. Therefore, we can expect iPhone 7 to come with a curved wraparound display.. After all these years, chances of iPhone 7 to be water proof are really high. Patent has been submitted and though the research is still going on but we are expecting Apple to introduce this feature from the next generation phones.. Gesture passcodes are quite popular amongst the Android users and we might expect the same in iOS platform as well. In the iOS 9 platform we have to use a 6 digit passcode which the users are not at happy to use. Gesture entry technique patent has been already submitted by Apple and gesture passcode might be integrated in iPhone 7.. In the next generation phones, SIM card is expected to be integrated within the phone and it aligns with different carriers and has the same feature as the normal SIM card. Introduction of this feature in iPhone 7 is going to make the phone far more secured.. Wireless charging unit was expected to arrive along with iPhone 6s, however it was not introduced. So we are expecting Apple to introduce wireless charging option in the next generation phone.. It goes without saying that iPhone 7 will be powered by iOS 10 and therefore it will flaunt all the new features that are being included in the next generation iOS platform.. AirPort Extreme Base Station Wireless router last year and it is full for great features. we can connect all your Apple device to your network with the help of this router. if you want to check the other wifi router check this buying guide .. iPhone 7 is going to be integrated with a 12MP primary and 5MP secondary camera just as it is present in iPhone 6S. However, the main attraction as far as iPhone 7’s camera is concerned will be the performance booster that will be added to it. Firstly, it might be equipped with OIS. Secondly, the recent leaks suggest that it will come with a bigger lens that will let in more light and thus ensure better quality picture.. Chances of iPhone 7 coming with dual camera are remote. However, we might get to see iPhone 7 Plus or iPhone 7 Pro with dual lens which is definitely going to be a one of kind feature in iPhone.. iPhone 6S’s battery was not so good and in this genre we are expecting some good improvisations in the next generation iPhone. However, there are already rumors that iPhone 7 is going to be the slickest smartphone ever produced and therefore chances of it to come with a better battery are sleek. Nonetheless, tech geeks have dig out the news that though the battery will be sleeker but it will be stronger than the present one.. We have been requesting Apple to introduce expandable memory in iPhones from a long time. But our requests have remained unheard. So it is our earnest request again that iPhone 7 comes with expandable memory capacity that will allow us to buy the basic model of iPhone and then supplement it with a MicroSD card with greater capacity.. iPhone 7 base model should come with greater memory as the iOS takes away half of the space of the phone and when the phone gets updated, there is a lot more space crunch. So the base model of iPhone 7 should come with at least 32 GB memory.. As far as the price of this product is concerned, it is really difficult to speculate about this. However, previously we have seen the price of the flagship products have remained more or less the same. Therefore, we can guess that iPhone 7 will come with a price tag of $850 for 16GB, $1000 for 64GB and $1100 for 128GB. this is best valentine gift for your girlfriend .. Rumors suggest that iPhone 7 might come with a smart connector just like the one present in Apple’s iPad Pro range. The idea of iPhone 7 coming with a connector first appeared in a leaked image of the model of the phone. These connectors are basically used for connecting the gadget to a keyboard. Since these connectors have hardly any utility in the iPhone 7, we were wondering that it might not be true. However, there are chances that iPhone 7 Plus might be equipped with the connectors.. There are also rumors that the traditional home button of the iPhone might be replaced with a pressure sensitive finger print sensor. The pressure sensitive button can be used for different purpose.. The Chinese tech site Weibo came up with the news that iPhone 7 might come up with a range of new features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, multi force touch technology, wireless charging and USB type charging point that will be compatible with the earplugs as well.. These are the rumored features of iPhone 7 that the tech geeks are talking about right now. Apart from these here is a list of features that we would like to see in iPhone 7:. Firstly, it would be great if iPhone 7 comes with a wireless charger that will be compatible with iWatch as well. Wireless technology is widely available all over the world now, so it would be great if Apple introduces it this time.. Secondly, we would like to see iPhone 7 in different sizes suiting the needs of the different users. Along with the 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch sizes, we would also like to see iPhone 7 with 4 inch screen with all the same features.. Thirdly, iPhone 7 with an unbreakable screen will be a tremendous feature that will definitely enhance the number of fan following of iPhones worldwide.. Fourthly, iPhone 7 with a curve edged display is another feature that we will definitely like to see. We would love to see iPhone 7 with round edged display.. Fifthly, Touch ID was already introduced in iPhone 6S which helps us to unlock the phone by recognizing the finger print of the owner. In iPhone 7 we would like to see biometrics going to the next level so that if we just look at it, the phone will get unlocked.. We will also expect iPhone 7 to come with a QHD display. That will enhance the users experience while playing video games in it or while watching movies in it. QHD display is a common feature of all flagship smartphones, so Apple might just be in the league by introducing it this time with iPhone 7. Check Also Best Portable charger.

I bought an I-phone 6 plus a few months back not realizing how many issues it has. It's been malfunctioning since the day I bought it. To say the least! Terrible battery life, it crashes all the time, volume drops often on, the few apps that I have also crash on and off. Eveytime a problem occurs I have to switch off the phone and reboot it! These phones are way over priced for what they offer. Totally not worth it! Best, Monika Mahajan. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of Wirefly.com..

Best Smartphones of 2016: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.. RED iPhone: Should you buy or donate?. Expert Review User reviews. What's Good About the iPhone 7. Let's face it, no review or personal opinion is going to convince anybody to not buy the upcoming iPhone 7. We're pretty sure people are already packing a bag to stand outside the electronics store to snatch up the latest iteration. While they're standing in line, they'll probably speculate on features for the iPhone 23.. Despite the fact minds have already been made, it's still our job to let our readers know what to expect from the latest Apple phone. We are happy to say fans won't be disappointed. The iPhone 7 is an iterative and polished upgrade. While we do bemoan there's no headphone jack - and we'd really like to know what Apple was thinking - and that the new phone has no real standout features, it is indeed a better phone and deserves to shine.. Well, that depends on what you like about the iPhone. It looks and feels like the 6 versions of the iPhone. It may lack a headphone jack but it comes with some dual speakers (though we didn't get to fully explore its capabilities). This generation has a slightly improved screen and it's water resistant. If you want a smarter, better camera though, you'll have to go with the iPhone 7 Plus.. Personally, we're having a hard time deciding why anyone would need the latest iPhone. But again we don't think that's going to stop anyone from standing in line three days in advance.. Design-wise, Apple must be comfortable with the iPhone 6 because they've applied no new touches to the iPhone 7. The iPhones 4, 5 and 6 had drastic changes to their appearance. The iPhone 7, on the other hand, looks pretty much like the iPhone 6 in screen size and dimensions. This does mean if you have a favorite case, you can take your old iPhone out and plug the new one right into it.. Some have taken the argument that Apple's engineers were either lazy or took the "if it ain't broke" theorem to any change in design. Of course, the iPhone 6 was easily one of the best designs in its market.. The phone will be coming in Black and Jet Black. You won't really see the difference until you're comparing the two phones. We prefer the Jet Black ourselves. If Space Gray was your go-to, it's gone. Another big change is the iPhone 7 will be its water resistance. Now, we wouldn't go deep sea diving or swimming in the ocean with the phone tucked in our shorts, but if you fell into the pool and got out right away, you're on good ground. You can also finally take your iPhone into the shower and be that much closer to monitoring your notifications.. There is one other big change that's got everybody talking. That's the manufacturer's decision to remove the headphone jack. The debate includes practical theories like the removal allows for a thinner device and greater battery space, to conspiracies such as Apple's decision to make big bucks off licensing fees manufacturers will have to pay for producing Lightning port headphones. Apple has only officially announced they got rid of the "ancient" port.. The iPhone 7 will come bundled with a Lightning 3.5 mm headphone jack. This will alleviate the aggravation for consumers that resent the idea of giving up their Beats to convert to Lightning cables. There will also be a set of Earpods powered by Lightning.. There was a story going around that Apple planned to do away the home button. Instead, the manufacturer made the button haptic. Instead of clicking all the way in, it will vibrate under your finger. The iPhone 7 will still house a fingerprint scanner, but it will function in a new way.. We do like how the iOS 10 fires up just by picking up the phone, so we're a little disappointed that Apple hasn't done anything similar. This is probably due to their continuous efforts to not be like the competition. Missing a tactile click is going to take some patience, but we doubt it's going to be a deal breaker for iPhone users.. Apple has lagged behind the industry in screen resolution and doesn't seem to give a crap. Their decision to go with 720p screens in 2016 (!) felt almost Flintstonian. Still, Apple does incorporate LCD tech. Also, factor in the way their phone screens are bonded to glass and their overall color reproduction, and the iPhone still offers a great presentation, almost making up for the lack of sharpness. This is especially obvious if you do a side-by-side with something like the Galaxy S7.. We're still hoping Apple decides to join us the in 21st with 1080p, especially considering its target audience's interest in virtual reality. (This is on Apple's drawing board). But the iPhone 7 isn't about resolution. It's about a standard that's designed to make things on the screen pop. That's not going to stop us from hoping for greater resolution and larger screens.. Apple diehards like to argue they prefer an increased battery life, which the 7 boasts (see below). This is the result of a lesser need to generate higher graphics. But considering the competition and the tech, it doesn't make sense why Apple has chosen to not improve these productions.. Well, guess there should be something to look forward to in the iPhone 23.... Many imagined with the removal of a headphone jack, Apple would go gangsta on sound, putting music at the top of its lists of things to improve. Well, Apple has taken into account the power of Lightning ports and its ability to carry large amounts of data to headphones. They've boosted their latest phone's capacity to deliver tremendous sound to match Lightning tech.. Apple has dispensed with the single mono output, replacing it with dual speakers. They will be positioned at the top and bottom of the phone to create stereo sound, giving tune listening and film watching a new perspective.. Unfortunately, a full preview of the phone's internal sound quality wasn't available at the time of this review. We do have high expectations that Apple is doing serious work on output quality. Some rumors rumble about Apple adding support for hi-res audio files. This would be sweet considering a Lightning port can produce better audio quality in its data transmission alongside Apple's announcement that there is no better way to get sound from a phone to your ears.. The iPhone 7 will also see another radical feature: proprietary standard wireless functionality. It's wireless capability that's similar to current EarPods, apart from infrared sensors which can sense when they are in ears.. After all the hoopla, it would be a great disappointment if Apple chose to not include hi-res audio support, especially after amping up output on the iPhone 7. Otherwise, users will not really be able to take advantage of the power of the Lightning port.. Apple has not put a lot of effort into the iPhone 7's picture taking. There are minor tweaks, at best. The camera's pump is more prominent now. We found this bothersome because now you can't place the phone down without some wobbling. The snapper will still be 12MP so that you can take good shots without burdening phone engines. Combined with the larger sensor (and the bump), expect better low light pictures, faster shutter speeds and richer day-to-day photography.. The front facing camera has been pumped to 7MP. There are some smart features for light enhancing brought over from the iPhone 6S that enhance the faculty for taking selfies.. Tack on the dual camera installation at the rear of the iPhone 7 and there's not much else to put this model on the picture-taking map.. The iPhone's battery life has been significantly increased compared to the iPhone 6 and 6S. There's a new A10 Fusion chip which accommodates low power efficiency and a boost to four cores. While we didn't have time to test it, Apple has announced the iPhone 7 has the potential to last at least two hours longer in its "day-to-day use" compared to the phone's previous iteration and an hour longer than the 6S.. Pricing is fairly similar to past generations. You will be able to get models with storage capacities of 32, 128 and 256 gigs. Respectively, models are going to cost $649, $749 and $849. Steep prices but not unusual to the iPhone fan.. Preorders will start being taken on September 9th and you'll be able to have one in your anxious paws beginning September 17th.. Apple is certainly happy with what it had, explaining why the iPhone 7 is so similar to the iPhone 6. We already said the iHard fans aren't concerned. So we will say the upgrades will make them happy, especially the water resistance and dual speakers.. Get $100 off iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. Get $100 off iPhone 8 or 8 Plus.

Listed Price : 50,810. Apple launched the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus back in September, and they have both gone on sale in India. Let's focus on the iPhone 7 for now, with its prices starting from Rs 60,000, and going up to Rs 80,000. It is available in three storage variants -- 32GB, 128GB and 256GB -- and users can choose from five color variants -- rose. Let's start with the design first, and Apple's new iPhone 7 looks very similar to last year's iPhone 6s. In fact, put a case and you will be hard-pressed say if it is the iPhone 7 or its predecessor. Having said that though, there are enough tweaks to keep buyers happy. One of the most important bits is the tweaking of the antenna lines, which have now been pushed to the very edges of the device, leaving the back panel nicely minimal. Another major change is at the bottom, where the 3.5mm audio jack is missing, and now the Lightning connector is used for charging and for audio. In its place, Apple has added what looks like an extra pair of speaker grilles. But as the teardowns revealed, they are actually barometric vents.. The Touch ID sensor too is different this time around. For one, it is not clickable anymore. Apple has added its Force Touch technology, so it simulates the feel of a button via haptic feedback.. Another major talking point is the IP67 certification both new iPhones come with. What this certification means is that the iPhone 7 is protected against harmful dust, and secondly, it can be submerged in one meter of water for up to 30 minutes without harming it.. The iPhone 7 flaunts a 4.7-inch HD (1334x750 pixels) LED display with 326ppi. Apple says that the display on its new iPhone is up to 25 percent brighter than the iPhone 6s, and comes with a wider color gamut to deliver vibrant, cinema standard colors. 3D Touch feature from the iPhone 6s is also present here.. Under the hood is Apple's latest A10 Fusion 64-bit quad-core processor paired with M10 co-processor, and 2GB of RAM. The company proudly said that its new processor is up to two times faster than the A8 chipset on the iPhone 6. The hexa-core GPU boosts graphic performance by up to three times compared to an iPhone 6.. These internals helped the iPhone 7 score an impressive 178,397 on AnTuTu benchmark tests.. As is the case with every iPhone launch, Apple has again focused on pushing the boundary of what a smartphone camera is capable of. Though there's been a lot of discussions about the dual-camera setup on the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 7 camera is no slouch. Though with the iPhone 7, Apple has stuck with a 12-megapixel snapper, it is now going for a larger f/1.8 aperture for improved low-light photography. The camera also comes with optical image stabilization (OIS), 4K video recording support, and is accompanied by a True Tone quad-LED flash -- two cool and two warm tones. For selfie lovers, there is now a 7-megapixel front-facing HD camera with f/2.2 aperture. It also lets you record 1080p videos at 30fps.. The Apple iPhone 7 now also boasts stereo speakers. With the main speaker at the bottom, the earpiece acts as the second speaker when playing music or watching videos. Apple says that the new speaker system is twice as loud as the iPhone 6s.. Apple doesn’t usually reveal the size of the battery inside the new iPhones. But different listings online have revealed that the iPhone 7 features a 1,960mAh battery, which is up from the 1,715mAh battery on the iPhone 6s. Apple says the bigger battery and the efficient processor helps in getting up to two hours more battery life when compared to an iPhone 6s. It claims the battery is good enough for up to 14 hours of talktime on 3G, standby time of up to 10 days, up to 14 hours of internet usage on Wi-Fi, up to 13 hours of video playback and up to 40 hours of audio playback.. The iPhone 7 comes with the usual bevy of connectivity options like Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac with MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2, and NFC. Apple has also included an advance LTE chipset on the iPhone 7 with speeds up to 450Mbps for faster data downloads, which is up to 50 percent faster compared to iPhone 6s, and three times faster than iPhone 6. It also supports VoLTE support for HD voice calling, and includes support for up to network 25 bands to offer best worldwide roaming experience across countries. On the software front, the iPhone 7 runs on the iOS 10 out-of-the-box.. Apple iPhone 7 Long Term Review: Most of the goodness, for a fraction of the price.

So, now Apple has launched their iPhone 7 flagship that includes 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch smartphone. These phones are announced on September 7, 206 and are going to be available by September 16. Apple has made some major changes with this flagship like exclusion of 3.5 mm audio jack, dual camera, A10 fusion chipset, water resistance and many more.. This year Apple has launch it’s mini smartphone with iPhone SE which exceptionally well manufactured as it have all the features that we have seen in iPhone 6S. iPhone SE comes with 4 inch large display and comes at a price of $399 which is really affordable. Apple is now working on its 2016 flagship. Last year company has launched iPhone 6 Smartphone and also bought an S version which is just an upgraded iPhone6. The next iPhone is expected to be named as Apple iPhone 7 and will be expected to release in Q3 of 2016. So, this year also we are looking for two variants. Here we are going to talk about specification and features of next generation iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Pro.. 1 Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. 1.1 Apple iPhone 7 Specifications 1.1.1 Water and Dust proof iPhone: 2 Apple iPhone 7 Release date 3 Apple iPhone 7 Price. Apple has filed many new patents in 2015 which are clear signs of innovation. Apple has announced iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and airpods with IFA 2016. Pre-orders are going to start from September 9 and both devices will be available in market by September 9, 2016.. The iPhone 7 is rumoured to have large display with 4K resolution. Also this time Apple is going to upgraded 3D touch and pressure sensitivity if iPhone. It reported to features an upgraded ISOCELL camera which can shoot crystal clear images even in low lights.. According to macrumors , the next iPhone is going to have all-new design with better camera and multi tasking performance.. So, far Apple has not revealed any sign of iPhone 7 Specifications and features. But here we are going to see some expected specs of iPhone7 and most likely you will see these features in next iPhone.. Apple is not fan of increasing it’s hardware more as they believes more in optimising. The iPhone 6 and 6S has launched with just 2GB RAM but one of the best device when it comes to multi tasking. Apple iPhone 7 can have 3 or 4GB RAM (not confirmed) with Apple A10 SoC. Before we go in details of iPhone 7 let’s check out some major highlights for next Apple iPhone:. So, these features looks like perfect for iPhone7.. Apple has launched iPhone 6 with 4.7 inch and 6s with a 5.5 inch large display. As per the rumours, Apple is working in adopting OLED displays for Smartphone and also working on liquid crystal Micro LED for mobile but iPhone 2016 is not going to have that. Well some reports are also stating that iPhone can have in-house Retina display.. According to recent reports Apple can stick with same display sizes for next iPhone as well. But there may be possibilities that Apple can bring slightly large iPhone this year. We are expecting a 5-inch large iPhone and 5.5 of 5.7 inch large iPhone 7S Smartphone this year with having 4K resolution. This year Apple is rumoured to have sapphire glass protection instead of conventional Gorilla Glass. Apple has already using Sapphire glass protection for iWatches and this glass is unbreakable.. It seems like Apple is working on A10 processor. Apple iPhone 7 will have 2GB RAM while iPhone 7 Pro variant is rumored to have 3GB LPDDR4 RAM which can give major boost in performance. Apple A10 chip-set is going to a Octa-Core 10 nm architecture. As per the reports A10 is going to be 70% faster than present SoC’s. This means Apple iPhone7 and 7S are going to perform really well.. See: Apple iPhone 8 Concepts and Specifications. The iPhone 6 came with 12 MP camera and there is huge possibility that Apple will uplift its camera sensors to at least 13 MP this year. It’s going to have upgraded ISOCELL sensors. In 2016, iPhone Smartphone will features some amazing features like HDR, upgraded autofocus, face and smile detection and light sensors. This device will also have a powerful front camera with 8 mega pixels.. This year we are expecting a more powerful device from Apple. It will have large battery life with fast charging features. We also studied patent filed by Apple last year. So, there may be possibility that Apple may use few of them for this iPhone. Its going to have dual camera, improved data transfer and fast data connectivity.. Yeah, iPhone 7 is going to be water and dust resistant Smartphone. As per the recent rumours it can have IP68 Standard water proof which means you can submerge it in 3 meter water up to 30 minutes.. The release date of iPhone 7 is going to not tough one to guess here. In 2015 Apple has announced iPhone 6 on 9th September. For now they are not likely to announce another flagship in MWC 2016. So, it pretty common to guess that Apple will release iPhone in Q4 2016. Some of websites also coined September 13 as announcement date but this is just guess. We are expecting an official announcement of iPhone 7 around 2 nd week of Sept, 2016 .. We all knew when its Apple price doesn’t matter a lot as we are going to have something incredible. The iPhone 7 price will be around $900 to $1000 USD. This price is can varies according to your iPhone 7 variant. Apple is going to come with 32GB, 64GB and 128GB Smartphone this year. Meanwhile we are also getting rumours for one more iPhone phablet that can be named as iPhone SE which is expected to get announce in May-June 2016.

iPhone 7 Review: Apple's Best iPhone Ever, But Just Barely. iPhone 7 Review: Apple's Best iPhone Ever, But Just Barely. The good : Improved camera, Long battery life, Fast performance, Cheapest option starts at 32GB instead of 16GB The bad : Takes longer to charge than rival devices, Lack of a headphone jack can be inconvenient Who should buy: Apple fans upgrading from an older model and anyone interested in mobile photography. Save a few tweaks, Apple’s new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus look plenty similar to their predecessors — at least on the outside. But internal changes are abound, from an amped-up processor to an upgraded camera .. This year’s iPhone marks a turning point for the Cupertino, Calif. Apple has long followed a “tick-tock” pattern for its iPhones. In a “tick” year, the company reveals a dramatic redesign, as it did with the iPhone 6 and its larger screen in 2014. In a “tock” year, Apple offers an incremental update to the previous model, like it did with the iPhone 5s, which looked like the iPhone 5 but with a new fingerprint scanner.. Apple is now straying from that cycle, introducing an iPhone — the iPhone 7 — that looks remarkably similar to the iPhone 6 and 6s. Rather than giving the 7 a complete exterior makeover, Apple improved characteristics like battery life, camera quality, and physical durability. That’s a risky move for the company, which has until now been able to count on big, easily noticeable upgrades every two years to juice sales of the iPhone, its best-selling product.. Read more: We took Apple’s iPhone 7 to Zion National Park. So what’s noteworthy about the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus? For one, they’re the first Apple smartphones officially certified as water resistant. Their upgraded cameras take in more light, while the larger Plus model features a second lens for zooming. Under-the-hood processor improvements mean faster performance and better battery life. In these ways and others, Apple is catching up to its smartphone rivals, notably Samsung, which makes some of the best Android phones available.. I’ve been using the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as my primary phone for the past several days. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use them.. An Apple iPhone 7 is seen during a launch event on September 7, 2016 in San Francisco, California.. Yes, the iPhone 7 looks very similar to the iPhone 6s. But there are some subtle changes. Most notably, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come in two new finishes, Black and Jet Black. The standard Black model is similar to Apple’s other finishes, but in a darker shade than the Space Gray variant. It has a clean, matte look that feels fresh alongside Apple’s gray and silver options. Meanwhile, the Jet Black finish is a striking departure from Apple’s usual style. It has a glossy, piano-like look that vaguely resembles the iPhone 5C’s shiny aesthetic. It’s nice, but there’s a drawback: The Jet Black model is a magnet for fingerprints and other smudges, meaning buyers will probably want to add a case that largely hides the finish anyway.. Flip over the iPhone 7 and you’ll notice another physical change. Gone are the antenna lines that stretch across the back of the phone. Apple has instead embedded them in a less noticeable location toward the top of the device. (They’re practically invisible on the new Jet Black and Black finishes.) It’s a subtle tweak that distinguishes the iPhone 7 from many similar-looking rivals. But again, if you plan to use a case, you won’t notice this change.. The real trick to telling the iPhone 7 apart from its predecessor is flipping it upside-down in search of a headphone jack, because the new iPhone doesn’t have one. Anybody who wants to bring their old, wired headphones to this particular party will need to use Apple’s included adapter, which connects them through the iPhone 7’s Lightning port. (Apple also includes a pair of its wired earbuds that connect the same way; it’s separately selling a pair of wireless earbuds we’ll discuss separately.). A new Apple iPhone 7 is seen during a launch event on September 7, 2016 in San Francisco, California.. How big of a deal is headphone jack’s disappearance? Music fans who’ve splurged on high-end headphones may be peeved about keeping track of an additional adapter that might be easily lost; replacements will cost $9.99. And iPhone 7 users won’t be able to listen to songs through wired headphones and charge their phone at the same time without an optional dock. But for people who just want to listen to music on their morning commute or during a jog, Apple’s included earbuds will do just fine.. Another difference becomes apparent only when actually using the iPhone 7. The home button that sits below the screen isn’t a “button” in the most traditional sense, meaning it doesn’t depress when pushed. Instead, it’s powered by Apple’s “Taptic Engine,” a vibration device also found on the latest MacBooks and the Apple Watch. When you click the iPhone 7’s home button, the Taptic Engine produces a clicking sensation mimicking an actual press.. The button takes a little getting used to, especially if you haven’t used the Taptic Engine on other Apple gear. And it doesn’t necessarily make it easier to unlock your phone or launch Siri. But it does make the iPhone experience feel more consistent overall, as the iPhone’s “3D Touch” provides a similar sensation. Since Apple no longer uses a mechanical button for the home key, there’s also less of a chance it will malfunction after extended use.. Why get rid of the headphone jack and a “true” home button? The changes helped Apple reach a larger goal: Water resistance. Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus can be submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes, which should mean an accidental drop in the pool or a sudden rainstorm will no longer put the device’s life in jeopardy. After dunking my iPhone 7 in roughly one foot of water multiple times, the device continued to work flawlessly. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 has a slightly higher tolerance level; it can survive in five feet of water for up to 30 minutes.. Michael Bucher and Marisa Gertz (gif) for TIME. Both of Apple’s new iPhones have gotten a noticeable boost when it comes to photography. This is especially apparent in three specific areas: low-light performance, color capture, and, for the iPhone 7 Plus model only, zooming.. To be blunt: Yes, the camera on this year’s iPhone is definitely an improvement over that of the iPhone 6s. The new phones’ cameras shoot beautifully vibrant photos, making those taken with the iPhone 6s almost look dull in comparison. This was a much needed boost, as rivals like Samsung have been steadily improving their cameras.. We Tested the iPhone 7's Camera in Zion National Park.

Jane Horth climbing Namaste Wall in Zion.. Two Bighorn sheep spotted from highway 9.. Rappelling 300 feet into Englestead Hollow on Sept. Apple’s approach towards photography has long been different from that of its competition. iPhones typically capture scenes more in tune with how they look in real life, instead of exaggerating colors for an easy but less accurate “pop.” This year, Apple has upped the colors just enough to make the iPhone’s photos appear more vivid without going too far.. Apple fans serious about mobile photography will probably want to opt for the iPhone 7 Plus model, which features a big benefit missing from the smaller model: A second camera lens. This extra lens, which is telephoto instead of the typical wide-angle glass, is designed to take better zoomed-in photos, long an Achilles’ heel of smartphone cameras. The lens can physically zoom up to 2x, with digital zoom taking it the rest of the way to 10x. Apple’s other iPhones can only zoom up to 5x, and that’s all digital zoom. (Physical zoom typically offers a better-quality photo than digital zoom, which is effectively equivalent to cropping a photo after it’s been taken.). The iPhone 7 Plus’ telephoto lens offers an unprecedented level of detail while zooming. Below, you can see the photos I captured of a chalkboard sign outside a local restaurant while zoomed in as far as possible. You’ll notice the text in the image taken with the iPhone 7 Plus looks much crisper. That’s not to say you’ll achieve perfectly sharp photos while zooming — there’s only so much you’ll get from a smartphone compared to a telephoto lens on a high-end camera. But it’s impressive nonetheless for a smartphone.. Apple’s new iPhones are also much better at taking photos in low light, thanks to a wider aperture (f/1.8, instead of f/2.2) and a new four-LED flash that’s 50% brighter than previous models. In my testing, the improved flash felt better at lighting subjects more evenly and capturing accurate skin tones compared to past iPhones. But the flash didn’t light scenes as evenly as Samsung’s Galaxy S7 did under the same conditions — though the iPhone 7’s flash was brighter.. For the selfie-takers out there, Apple’s latest iPhones also pack improved the front-facing cameras. Both devices come with a new 7-megapixel front camera, a modest improvement over the last model’s 5 megapixels. The difference isn’t too noticeable compared to the iPhone 6s, but it outranks both Samsung and Motorola’s latest phones when it comes to taking great selfies. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 makes the colors in selfies look bolder, but its images aren’t as detailed as the front-facing photos taken with the iPhone 7. The Galaxy S7’s front camera also struggled with lighting in my testing scenario, resulting in a photo that had a yellowish tint compared to the iPhone’s.. Apple’s new iPhones are powered by the company’s latest processor, the A10 Fusion. The new hardware packs four cores, double that of the A9, with two designated for high-performance tasks and an additional pair optimized for efficiency. The two performance cores alone are 40% faster than the A9 chip inside the iPhone 6s and twice as speedy as the iPhone 6’s A8, according to Apple. The improved performance is somewhat noticeable in everyday tasks: the iPhone 7’s camera launches slightly faster than that of the 6s, and the phone unlocks just a hair quicker as well. These enhancements are more prominent when using more resource-greedy apps, like Prisma , which uses artificial intelligence to edit photos in the style of famous artists. With the iPhone 7, the Prisma app was able to work its apparent magic a few seconds faster than it does on the iPhone 6s.. The new A10 Fusion chip also contributes to the new iPhones’ improved battery life. While you’re chatting, snapping and gaming away, the iPhone 7 is busy determining which core should be used at any given moment, making it better at power management.. Indeed, Apple claims the iPhone 7 can last up to two hours longer than the iPhone 6s on a full charge. I’ve found that to be generally true, although battery life will always vary depending on how you use your phone. The iPhone 6s usually gets me through a full day and can just scrape by until the early morning if I don’t plug it in overnight. By contrast, the iPhone 7 provided a full work day’s worth of use and survived until around 10:30 am the next morning, which falls about in line with Apple’s claims. (My daily smartphone usage typically consists of streaming music, sending text messages, checking Facebook and Twitter, sending and reading email, browsing the web, occasionally playing games, streaming video, and using Bluetooth accessories. If this sounds like your routine, you can likely expect similar results, but those looking for more battery power might want to opt for the 7 Plus and its beefier battery.). It’s worth noting here that while Apple has managed to improve the iPhone’s battery life, it hasn’t sped up the charging process itself. Some Android smartphones, like the Samsung Galaxy S7 and OnePlus 3, support quick charging technology; OnePlus says its phone can recharge up to 60% after being plugged in for just 30 minutes. (Samsung, it should be said, is currently embroiled in a massive recall involving battery issues with its Galaxy Note 7.). EarPods headphones with lightning connection is displayed next to an iPhone 7 Plus during an event in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. If you often listen to music or watch movies on your phone without headphones, you’ll be happy to know the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the first Apple smartphones with stereo speakers. Audio from TV shows, games and music all sounds deeper and richer here compared to the iPhone 6s. Still, you’ll get better sound out of almost any pair of headphones.. The Taptic Engine powering the iPhone 7’s home button is also front-and-center in Apple’s new smartphone software, iOS 10. The refreshed user interface is loaded with elements that take advantage of the engine’s vibrations — switching on an alarm in the Clock app produces a subtle but satisfying click, for example. Android phones have used vibrations in similar ways for years, especially for on-screen keyboards and navigational buttons. And for the first time, Apple is opening the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus’ Engine to third-party app developers, so they can use it in their apps and games. How useful this becomes largely depends on the developers.. Speaking with CNBC earlier this year, Apple’s CEO teased that the company would “give you things that you can’t live without that you just don’t know that you need today.” Do the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus live up to that statement? Not quite.. If you’re already carrying an iPhone 6s, there’s little need to upgrade, unless you’re a photography nut or desperately need better battery life. And many of the most exciting changes Apple has in store are actually part of iOS 10 , the software upgrade that will also be available for older iPhones. That said, the modest improvements make these the best iPhones Apple has made to date — but it’s nowhere near as big of an upgrade as the iPhone 6 was compared to past models.. The iPhone 7 may be evidence that gone are the days when a new smartphone could truly wow the world. After all, there’s only so much functionality you can pack in these devices before you enter the realm of the superfluous. Apple’s rivals are experimenting features that represent brilliant feats of engineering, like eye scanners that let you unlock your phone by looking at it, curved screens, and virtual reality support.. But perhaps what Apple realizes is that what most people want from their phones is simpler than all that: Long battery life, durability, and a great camera. There’s certainly room for improvement — quick-charging would be nice — but the iPhone 7 delivers on these vital points. It doesn’t “wow” like so many Apple products have. But then again, maybe it doesn’t need to. It’s not a huge upgrade, but it helps Apple’s smartphone remain one of the best around..

Besides, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus the Cupertino tech giant also sells refurbished versions of the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus .. As far as selling refurbished iPhones in India is concerned, Apple hasn't been given a go ahead yet. Last year, the Indian Government had rejected its plea to introduce refurbished iPhones in the country for environmental reasons.. The refusal coupled with the recent increase of the import duty from 15 percent to 20 percent hampers Apple's plan of capturing at least 3 percent of the Indian smartphone market share. It, however, remains to be seen how Apple will play its cards in the future to gain traction in the hitherto ignored Indian market.. Read more news on this product. Surprise appearance from Mario and leading FeliCa contactless technology is available. On-site Report: We get to spend some time with the new iPhone 7!. The new Jet Black color variant. Although the new iPhone 7 may look similar to the previous generation iPhone, details and internals were the places Apple spent their time on.. In the launching of the new iPhone 7 event, the creator of the popular Nintendo game "Mario" Shigeru Miyamoto introduced the new Mario game "Super Mario Run" for iOS. Aside from that, Japanese users rejoice, thanks to the announcement that the new iPhone is coming with an IC card technology "FeliCa" which has been a common means of payment in Japan specially in its transit. We had the chance to spend some time with the new iPhone 7 and we would like to report everything in the detail.. * This is a translation from the original Japanese article from kakaku.com.. Mario and FeliCa are now available on the new iPhone 7!. New color, waterproof, new home button, dual camera and the absence of the headphone jack. There were many special guests scheduled to appear for the iPhone 7 launching event in San Francisco, but the first one out of the bat was the creator of Mario, Shigeru Miyamoto. Mario has been busy recently, even appearing on the Rio Olympic Games closing ceremony, now it also finds its way to the iOS. Named as the "Super Mario Run," it shares similar game play as of the traditional Mario game but this, aside from accumulating gold coins, Mario needs to avoid holes buy jumping, where in this case users' need to tap their screen (Temple Run like game). "The Super Mario Run is just like the Super Mario game, easy and simple for everyone to play," said Shigeru Miyamoto, the game can be operated by just using one hand to tap the display, he even added that "People can enjoy playing the game while riding the train or even while eating a hamburger or an apple.". Every gamer possesses individual skills and they can apply it very easily in the new Super Mario Run game. They can speed thru the game with Mario's B dash or collect plenty of coins to build their own kingdom. It's pretty simple and fun which could possibly be very addictive to play. Tim Cook, Chief Executive (CEO) of Apple, expressed his gratitude for bringing the new Mario app in the iOS first, followed by other smartphone platforms. The new game is scheduled to be available in the App Store for free in December.. Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto was the first guest to appear on stage. Super Mario Run is a simple and easy game to play, users just have to tap the screen in order to avoid the obstacles.. Aside from the presentation of the Super Mario Run app, the sensational location-based augmented reality game that got more than 500 Million downloads all over the world, the Pokemon GO app will be available for the Apple Watch by the end of the year. Thanks to this, Pokemon trainers won't have to check their iPhone at every PokeStop or when a Pokemon appears. In addition, they can also enjoy playing the game while doing their normal routine like walking or jogging, safer with the added benefit of hatching eggs without losing too much attention on their exercise.. The popular game Pokemon GO app showcased to work on the Apple Watch which shares similar features as the "Pokemon GO Plus" accessory.. The Japanese market is very excited about the new FeliCa feature on the iPhone 7. This was one of the main reasons why the iPhone didn't appeal that much to the consumers in Japan. Japanese consumers use contactless payment a lot. Aside from using it as a commuter pass on public transits, contactless payment is also widely used in convenient stores, supermarkets and even on vending machines. Apple has already published details on their official site and has cooperated with Japan's JR East line to make contactless payment in conjunction with Apple Pay. This is certainly great news to faithful iPhone users and who are planning to get the new iPhone 7 in Japan since all this time, they've been placing their reloadable NFC-cards inside their iPhone case' just to make up for that one feature iPhone didn't provided before.. A large applause from the crowd was heard once the "FeliCa" logo was displayed on the slide. The new feature will work with JR East's NFC card "Suica" and is scheduled to be available in Japan from October.. The Map app can also explore and search routes related to Japan.. The star of the main event was none other than the new iPhone 7. Even though the overall design did not significantly change from the previous "iPhone 6s" series, the new iPhone 7's antenna parts were relocated and was brushed up to have a more simple design. In addition to the Black, Silver and Rose Gold, Apple also introduced a new color variation the "Jet Black" which features a very glossy finish that certainly adds more class to the overall design.. The Jet black is very shiny especially when it hits the light. Surely it'll attract plenty of marking from the users fingers but to our surprise, it didn't quite get that much than what we initially expected Thanks to the relocation of the antenna parts now located at the top and bottom of the device, the back of the new iPhone 7 now looks more refreshing than ever. Another surprising feature for the new iPhone 7 is that it now comes with a water and dustproof IP67 standards. It also comes with a new solid-state Home button, that uses the same Taptic engine found on the Apple Watch and MacBook to give a more precise and customizable tactile feedback. Thankfully, chances of breaking the Home Button is also reduced since it was one of the issues encountered on previous iPhones devices.. Thanks to the new IP67 certification, there's no need to worry when you accidentally drop your phone in water.. Here's the new pressure-sensitive Home button which still works like your previous Home Button but is better and has less chances of breaking down. The feedback from pressing the Home Button is now more precise and accurate thanks to the Taptic Engine mounted on the device.. Users can also customize the feedback with three different settings.. Many were excited to see the changes made with the new iPhone 7's camera. Going on the standard model first, although it may not seem to have a big update compared to the previous model, the standard iPhone 7's rear shooter is far more than better compared to its predecessor. The standard model now comes with Optical Image Stabilization (which in the previous model was only available with the Plus variant) and has a clearer outcome in low light scenarios thanks to the new f/1.8 lens. The 12MP main camera is also capable of taking 4k videos. Moving on, in the front, from 5MP on the standard iPhone 6s, the standard iPhone 7 comes with a 7MP "FaceTime HD" camera. And with the new "A10 Fusion" chip, Apple says that color balance and image processing is now more enhanced than ever before.. If you want the biggest upgrade, then the iPhone 7 Plus is the variant you opt to look out for. It comes 2 12MP cameras, a 12-megapixel wide angle camera and a 12-megapixel telephoto camera dual-camera system that the company claims can provide x10 optical zoom on photos and 6x optical zoom on video shooting. In addition, the new dual-camera has a sharper, deeper colors and wider dynamic range. It can also take DSLR like portraits and who doesn't love that blur effect in the background.. The new dual-camera system on the iPhone 7 Plus, better low light photos and x2 optical zoom. Thanks to the telephoto lens, image quality is not compromised even when performing double the optical zoom level.. By tapping the "2X" on the screen, you can zoom in on the image. There may be more features, but it is simple and easy which is what iPhone devices are known for. The dual-camera system learns the depth and field in real time which enables it to shoot DSLR portrait-like images.. When it comes to the iPhone 7's sound system, you won't be disappointed since it now comes with 2 built-in stereo speakers. Surely you won't be humiliated with the quality and loudness it provides when playing music or when you're enjoying watching videos or movies. Before the launching of the new iPhone 7, rumors had it that Apple will finally be eliminating the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of a Lightning port only system. Phil Schiller explained, that by eliminating the 3.5mm headphone jack, not only did they achieved a slimmer design but by using the Lightning port as a connector, users can now control and enjoy a better audio system. Apple is also known to make courageous decisions in order to innovate and provide consumers the necessary technology fitted in the era we are living.. If you're worried about not being able to use your favorite headphone on the iPhone 7, forget about it. Apple has also included a dongle in the package which serves as a converter for regular headphones if you prefer to use them over Apple's Lightning headphones.. Apple also released its new Bluetooth earphone called the "AirPods" and it's not your ordinary wireless earphones. Design aside, it comes with a dedicated rechargeable case that works in sync with the iPhone which can be paired very simply and doesn't need to be paired countless times when once you've paired it with other devices such as Macs, iPads or iPods.. It also comes with an optical and motion acceleration sensor. It can automatically play music once you place them inside your ears, stop the track or play it on speaker when you put them off. You can also activate Siri by double tapping, and speak through the built-in microphones located on the bottom edge of the unit. It can play tracks for 3 hours and only takes 15 minutes to recharge.. Gone is the 3.5mm headphone jack. Speakers on the right side and the microphone is located around the center portion.. The AirPods comes with a dedicated charging case and battery status can be easily monitored on the screen. It slightly wiggles around when fitted, but it's very easy to use especially when activating Siri.. The AirPods is equipped with a "W1 chip" in order to achieve both connectivity and sound quality. If you're wondering why the AirPods is designed that way and why does it looks like a regular Apple earphone without a wire, well, the battery and the antenna are too blame for that. The AirPods is scheduled to release in late October for the price of USD 159.. When it comes to Performance, both the Phone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus comes with a Quad-core "A10 Fusion" chip that features 2 high-performance core and 2 high-efficiency core for more efficient processing and battery life. The new iPhone 7 also has the highest level of graphic performance and longest battery life out of the series which should be no surprise at all given that it's the latest offering from the company.. A10 Fusion features a Quad-core consisting of two high-performance core and two high-efficiency core. Apple has been taking a complete product life cycle of the iPhone for every 2 years. Though a lot of great features have been added to this year's iPhone, we're quite disappointed about the lack of changes made with the design. But Apple clearly made it up with the new water and dust resistance IP67 certification, Contactless payment (FeliCa) feature, stereo speakers and dual-camera set up.. Spec and features wise, everything seems pretty great, but sadly we can't say we're very thrilled about the dropping of the 3.5mm headphone jack, indeed Apple made a bold move here, but only time can tell whether this decision is a success or a failure..

Updated with our thoughts on the new Product (RED) version. We are part of The Trust Project. There’s only one thing that matters about the Apple iPhone 7, and that’s its lack of a headphone port. That missing hole is a big deal, sure, but so are the improvements to the camera, the blistering speed of the new A10 processor, and the changes to the home button. In fact, to let any one feature dominate this review – whether good or bad – would be entirely out of keeping with the phone itself, which is the archetypal sum of its parts.. Some of the additions here may seem quite minor, but added together, they equal a surprisingly different beast from last year’s iPhone 6s.. Apple iPhone 7 audio: Hit the road, jack. Let's tackle the big issue right away. As you might have heard, the 3.5mm headphone port is no more, taken out back like Old Yeller and given both barrels by (presumably) a symmetry-obsessed Jony Ive.. You’ve got to switch to a pair of headphones with a Lightning adapter if you want to pump music directly into your ears now, or invest in some pricey Bluetooth buds. Sure, there’s a pair of Lightning EarPods in the box, but when have Apple’s bundled ’phones ever been the last word in critical listening?. So, just how big a deal is this? Well, let’s do a little fence sitting.. On the one hand, it’s a typically arrogant move by Apple which will definitely annoy millions of people who already own standard headphones and are quite happy with them really, thank you very much. We imagine there’ll be one or two upset headphone manufacturers too.. The change doesn’t really seem to bring many benefits and while Apple has at least included an adapter in the box so you can keep using that decent pair of in-ears or cans, it’s both pug-ugly and another thing to carry around (and lose) while you’re on the move.. On the other hand… so what? Wireless has been the future of audio for some time now and, in ditching the port, Apple has simply brought that reality forward by half a decade or so. Yes, it’s an arse if you feel the need to buy a new pair of quality headphones, but if you’re set to spend £40 or so a month on a new iPhone the reality is you can probably afford the switch. When it works, wireless feels genuinely new and exciting.. Apple does its thing, the world complains, Apple ignores the world, the world gets bored complaining and realises it still wants to buy an iPhone and yadda yadda yadda.. What you do get in place of the headphone port is a second speaker grille - however it doesn’t actually have a speaker behind it, instead just pumping out sound generated from behind the first grille. However up on top of the phone there is in fact a stealthy second speaker hidden behind the earpiece grille. It’s a first for Apple, and it really packs quite a lot of loud for its size. With both speakers pumping, it’ll easily overpower most other phones. Cover up one speaker and you’ll be amazed by how wide the stereo effect can be, too. Netflix in the bath just got a whole lot more immersive. And hey, this time your phone won’t drown if you don't fish it out quickly enough.. Apple iPhone 7 design: (Oil)Slick Rick. So, does anyone actually like rose gold? Nah, us neither. And the good news is that this year Apple’s colours du jour are black… and black.. You can still buy the Rose Gold model, and the Gold and Silver versions, but Space Grey is gone, replaced with a darker matte black hue. It’s joined by Jet Black, which is so glossy it’ll rival the sheen of any shampoo ad. Seriously, it’s so reflective you could use it as a mirror.. It’s undeniably gorgeous, stealthily hiding the phone’s matching antenna bands, but it’ll only stay that way if you can keep your hands off it. Once it’s in your paws, it’s on a one-way trip to Smudge City (population: Jet Black iPhones). Unless your hands come miraculously oil-free, or you’re fine with rubbing it on your clothes from time to time, you’re probably better off putting a case on it as it’s prone to tiny scratches too. That’s a shame, because that shine looks hella fine - when it’s untarnished.. Otherwise, the overall look hasn’t changed. The antennas don’t dominate the back any more (they’ve been shunted closer to the curved top and bottom) but with only a few exceptions, the shape basically stays the same as last year’s model.. It has picked up a new party trick, though: the iPhone 7 is IP67 water resistant, meaning it’ll shrug off a spilled drink, and even survive a dunking down the loo. You won’t take one swimming (and you shouldn’t because Apple’s warranty doesn’t cover liquid damage), but there’s now there’s no need to run for cover when the heavens open.. As with the colour, waterproofing is a real-world feature that will make millions of iOS devotees happy. Alright so this merely brings the iPhone in line with most Android flagships, but it’d be churlish to criticise it for tardiness when we’re just glad it arrived at all.. If you don’t like the idea of slipping a Jet Black fingerprint magnet into your pocket, but still want to stand out from the rest of the iPhone-owning world, Apple’s latest release could be just what you’ve been waiting for.. This Product (RED) special edition phone is supposed to raise awareness (and some much needed cash) for HIV and AIDS in Africa. Apple has raised a whopping £130 million to date, but this is the first time it has turned an iPhone red for the cause.. On the back, you get a metallic crimson hue that looks simply gorgeous, glinting in the light and staying smudge-free, even after a day of fondling. On the front, it has the same white glass treatment as the silver, gold and rose gold versions - not the black glass you’d find on a matt black or Jet Black iPhone 7.. Honestly, we would have preferred a black front, but the knowledge that some of your hard-earned cash will be going to a good cause will hopefully soften the blow.. Apple iPhone 7 features: No place like Home. The Home button has had a major overhaul - in fact, it’s not actually a button any more. Psych! Instead, it’s now one with the phone and uses Apple’s new Taptic engine (Apple’s fancy word for haptic feedback) to mimic the feel of a button.. It works just like the fancy new MacBook trackpad, which means you can customise how ‘clicky’ you want it, but even so it still takes some getting used to. That’s mainly because clicking isn’t isolated to the button - rather, it feels like you’re clicking the entire bottom of the phone and feel it through the rest of the phone.. This is hardly a deal-breaker, but might throw off long-time Apple fans when they first try it. Still, once you get used to it there are good reasons to be pleased about the new Taptic Home. Apps, for instance, can use the Taptic engine to add force feedback; the. demo I tried had different vibrations for different weapons, which really adds another dimension to gaming on the go.. You even get that nice clicky feedback when you scroll through your list of contacts within WhatsApp.. There are going to be a lot more missed bus and train stops once the iPhone 7 arrives.. The button might be new, but there’s still a TouchID fingerprint sensor underneath. This plays nicely with Apple Pay and secure online banking apps, and will unlock your phone just as swiftly as last year’s model.. Apple iPhone 7 software: A perfect 10. The Taptic Home button is a gateway to familiarising new iPhone owners with 3D Touch - something they’ll be seeing a lot of in iOS 10. There are a ton of pressure-sensitive opportunities in the new OS, such as the ability to adjust the intensity of the flashlight or quickly jump into the camera app’s selfie mode.. Little timesavers such as being able to answer a message directly from your notifications are further welcome upgrades.. Widgets have been moved to the lock screen, so you can get a lot done without actually unlocking your phone, and the Messages app has been overhauled with doodling capabilities and a Panini football sticker factory’s-worth of interactive emojis and animated adhesives.. There are other small improvements too, such as finally being able to listen to music while taking a photo. Hardly life-changing, but still a nice addition. We’ve gone into (a lot) more detail in our full Apple iOS 10 review .. Apple iPhone 7 display: Light up, light up. With no screen size or resolution bump, the 4.7in, 1334x750 iPhone 7 is on paper light years behind the Android competition. Get one in your hands, though, and it’s easy to agree with Apple’s view that 326dpi is plenty for something you hold a few feet in front of your face: s mall text is easy to read and pictures show plenty of detail.. QHD phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5 win out on pixel Top Trumps, but Apple fans don’t have to feel too bad about it. That’s partly because it’s now rocking a wider colour gamut, which makes everything look more vibrant and lifelike from the injection of light and colour. It really makes images pop that little bit better - even if shadows and blacks aren’t quite as deep as they look on a Samsung OLED.. It’s also had a major brightness boost, so it pumps out 25% more light than an iPhone 6s. That means sunshine addicts won’t have to squint or shield the screen whenever they step outside - perfect for anyone that likes to hang out by the pool or the beach in order to take advantage of the fact that a bit of water or sand now won’t cause your phone to throw a fit.. No more tapping the home button every few minutes to check if your latest Tinder crush has replied to your pitiful pickup lines, either: the screen automatically springs into life whenever you pick up the phone.. Apple iPhone 7 camera: Snappier than ever. There’s a reason six of the most popular cameras on Flickr are iPhones: they take great pictures. Not just “great for a phone” pics, but great pictures - period.. That trend looks set to continue here, but not because of a major megapixel increase. Apple’s sticking with 12MP, which means surface detail can’t quite match the higher pixel counts seen in top-spec Android phones, but pairing it with an f/1.8 aperture and OIS makes a big difference.. Optical Image Stabilisation used to be reserved for the larger Plus model, but the anti-shake stability tech is now found in the vanilla iPhone 7 as well; a lack of light won’t throw this snapper off its game. In our tests, the iPhone 7 turned out detailed pics that retained their true colours, instead of distorting reality with overly-saturated hues. Even when magnified, detail isn’t lost - although things can get a little fuzzy around the edges. And when the flash is eventually needed, the two extra LEDs keep things looking natural instead of bathing your subject in a ghastly glare.. It might not have the dual camera setup seen on its bigger brother, but the iPhone 7 still proved its prowess at taking photos on the go. It focuses on subjects a lot faster now, even in challenging light conditions, which made it a breeze to take crisp and clear shots in the middle of a laser-light filled music festival.. That’s partly down to the sensor saving pics with a wider colour gamut, something you’ll spot straight away on the phone’s colour-calibrated display. It gives things more vibrancy and gradation, without edging into unrealistic territory. You won’t get the same effect when you share your snaps to Facebook, but you’ll still be impressed you got quality shots from something that slips into your pocket. Even if, deep down, you’ll know the iPhone 7 Plus is still superior.. The front-facing FaceTime camera has also been bumped up from 5MP to 7MP, which will keep the selfie-loving Snapchat crowd happy.. Apple iPhone 7 Performance: Need for speed. Apple has finally gone quad-core in 2016, doubling up on CPU power for the A10 Fusion chip. And as you might expect, the iPhone 7 easily matched our fast and furious tapping, swiping, and double pressing without breaking a sweat.. Even after half an hour of continuous Riptide GP2 racing, the phone handled the heat well. No amount of notifications could create any visible lag or stutter, proving just how capable Apple’s silicon is when it comes to gaming.. On the other hand, battery life hasn’t improved all that much from last year - something Apple seems to recognise given that an iPhone 7-friendly version of the bumpy Smart Battery Case is launching day and date with the phone.. It’s definitely got more staying power than the iPhone 6s, but this isn’t quite the all-day endurance champ we were hoping for. In day-to-day use, it hit 20% after 10 hours - adequate, seeing as Low Power Mode will eke out a few precious extra minutes when you’re nearing empty, but you’re still going to have some battery anxiety towards the end of the day.. Android phones might have more powerful hardware and higher-resolution-screens to power, but they’ve also got room for bigger batteries. If you need longevity in the same size, there are better options out there running Google’s OS. if you can’t bear to leave iOS?. Then you'll want the larger-everything Apple iPhone 7 Plus.. Apple iPhone 7 storage: sayonara, 16GB. Struggling on with a phone that’s run out of storage space is no fun at all, and that’s a scenario all-too familiar to anyone with a 16GB iPhone. Thankfully, Apple has finally seen sense this year, bumping the basic iPhone 7 to 32GB.. There’s a colossal new 256GB option as well - perfect for anyone that absolutely has to have all their photos, music and movies with them at all times. And a fair bit of disposable cash to afford one, too.. It’s a real shame the 64GB version has been put out to pasture, though. With apps growing in size and an uprated camera taking better photos than ever, it’s not going to be long before you’ve maxed out 32GB. 64GB seems to be the sweet storage spot for many of the Stuff team - a figure that’s easy to get on an Android phone with a microSD card, but one that’s now out of reach if you’re committed to iOS.. This phone really shouldn’t feel like a major update. Standout features here, such as waterproofing, are long overdue in Apple land, the design has barely changed bar a few skin-deep tweaks, and some of the upgrades fans have been crying out for (more storage, for instance) come at the expense of mid-range models.. We’ve been stung by a Brexit-related price spike here in the UK, too. Buying into the iPhone way of life was never cheap, but you’ll be forking over £800 for the top-spec 256GB model.. It says a lot about the overall package, then, that we’re happy to put up with the shortcomings. The iPhone 7’s modest upgrades all come together to make a much more significant whole than you’d expect; in typically Apple fashion, the whole experience is just so polished.. The old “skip a year” mantra still holds true for anyone with an iPhone 6s, but for everyone else running iOS on older hardware, this is a very worthy upgrade and you’ll feel the substantial difference. Losing the headphone port, though? That’s going to sting for a while.. The 10 best smartphones in the world right now. Apple iPhone 7 review The iPhone 7 is polished enough to feel new all over again, headphone port or not. No longer as allergic to water as a Mogwai. A screen that isn’t defeated by bright sunshine. Camera quality takes another step up. That Jet Black finish is a total fingerprint magnet. Where to buy Apple iPhone 7:. Where to buy Apple iPhone 7:.

Author: David Pierce David Pierce. The new iPhones don't look different, because what they look like doesn't really matter anymore.. More and Less DSLR.app A Blank Slate Update, a few months later. Remember when the iPhone was exciting? When every new design and app was an event in itself? When copy-paste was a feature to line up for? Those days are gone. Now, each year's unprecedented combination of incredible technology feels ordinary, even expected. That doesn’t mean the magic’s gone. It’s just harder to see when it’s everywhere.. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are out this Friday, starting at $650 and $770 respectively. They're the best, fastest, strongest iPhones yet. They also indicate, nine years into the iPhone experiment, that we're nearing some platonic ideal of a smartphone, the device in its final minimalist form. This is happening everywhere, by the way, not just in Cupertino. All the wildest ideas about smartphones are actually wild ideas around smartphones: hardware and software that connect to us and each other through our phones. For the smartphones themselves, there's forever thinner, faster, stronger, and maybe curved-screenier, but that's about it. At least, until the next world-bending material sciences breakthrough.. The iPhone 7 may look like the iPhone has for years , but it works better. It's more seamless, more open to third parties, and more connected to the rest of the Apple ecosystem. More than anything, this phone is Apple's acknowledgement that how an iPhone looks is increasingly beside the point. What matters is what an iPhone can do.. As always, the new iPhone is a better iPhone. Its new A10 Fusion processor is ludicrously, outrageously fast, somehow even more so than last year's (already crazy fast) A9. It's a quad-core processor, with two cores dedicated to running simple tasks and two to more taxing ones. That means if you don't really game or watch high-res video on your phone, your battery life is going to be extraordinary. When I used the iPhone 7 for only simple things, I got more than 24 hours of life from the 7, and nearly 48 from the 7 Plus. As soon as I fired up Riptide GP: Renegade and streamed Halt and Catch Fire , I had to charge once during the day or be left stranded by 9pm.. The 7's screen is brighter than the 6S, but for the life of me I can't imagine why you'd ever use your phone at full brightness. The earpiece now doubles as a speaker, so you get surprisingly decent stereo sound out of the phone itself. It's not great, or even good, but it's much better than the 6S. Really, the best news on the spec sheet is that the iPhone 7's internal storage starts at 32GB and goes up to 256GB. No more "Storage Almost Full" messages while I'm trying to take pictures of my dog! Or at least, it'll take a lot longer to get there.. The basic frame of the iPhone 7 hasn't changed a bit from the slim, metal rectangle you already know. The 7 Plus still has a 5.5-inch screen, and 4.7 for the iPhone 7. There are a few subtle ways to tell the new model from the old, like the more subtle antenna lines and the sloping edges around the camera hump that now rises like a volcano rather than protruding like it was hole-punched. The two new colorways, jet black and black, are also a dead giveaway. Or, as I call them, I Already Scratched It Glossy Black and Awesome Secret Agent Matte Black .. Of course, the easiest way to figure out what phone you're holding is to try and plug in headphones. If you can't, congrats! You've found a new model. There's really nothing to say about the absence of the headphone jack except that it's not there, which really is annoying sometimes. Like when I'm on the train, and can't charge from an external battery and listen to music at the same time.. Apple's solution to these gripes is a pair of wireless, $159 AirPods, but your answer will probably be to buy yet another awkward dongle that lets you still plug your wired headphones in. That's another gripe; any time I left the tiny white connector at work, I couldn't use my preferred cans. I'm into the idea that wireless is the future, but getting there is going to be painful and adapter-filled.. It’s Fine If the iPhone Looks the Same. With the iPhone 7, Apple Makes Dual Cameras the New Normal. With iOS 10, Your iPhone’s Basically Just a Lockscreen Now. Switching to Wireless Headphones? Here Are 13 Great Options. After a week, I've stopped trying to plug things into my phone's phantom headphone jack. But I cannot, for the life of me, get used to the iPhone 7's new home button. It's not a button anymore, just a capacitive surface that uses haptic buzzes and taps to provide feedback. That's great for the longevity of your phone, since the home button tends to break before anything else. It's even really cool in some places on the iPhone, lending a certain physicality to on-screen stuff by buzzing when you get to the end of a list or rattling like an actual machine gun when you fire upon the unsuspecting enemy. But when I press to unlock my phone, my thumb vibrates like it's about to dent the glass. It's not like it ruins the phone, but I miss the click.. Honestly, though, I'm happy to trade both headphone jack and home button to get a water-resistant phone. (Not that I should have to, as Samsung and everyone else have proven.) Being able to use my phone in the shower, or at least inside the Toothbrushing Splash Radius, is wonderful. Even more than that, knowing my IP67-rated iPhone 7 can handle a light rainstorm or splash of tequila brings a wonderful peace of mind. The iPhone 6S was already sort-of mostly waterproof , but the iPhone 7 is the real deal.. So far, unless you have a bad history with phones and toilets or an intense goth streak, there's nothing about the iPhone that would make any 6S or even 6 owner jump at the upgrade. The thing Apple's hoping will push you over the top is staring out the back of the iPhone 7 like a Wall-E robot: the new and improved camera.. The iPhone 7 camera is the easy one to review. The 12-megapixel sensor now comes with an f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization, which all together means you'll get brighter, sharper photos and video even in terrible lighting. (If that's not enough, the flash is now much brighter as well.) Apple made hay about the 100 billion calculations the camera does every time you shoot a photo, and how fast the new processor is, but I didn't notice a big difference in the actual shooting experience over last year's model. The photos and video are the important part, though, and they're much better now. You can even shoot in RAW and process photos later. And for selfies, the 7-megapixel FaceTime camera takes Kardashian-ready shots every time.. The 7 Plus is the more interesting camera, mostly because it's actually two cameras, both 12 megapixels, each with a different focal length. The wider camera, at 28mm, is basically the same you'll find in the iPhone 7. Next to it there's a similar lens at 56mm, and the camera app lets you switch between the two instantly.. What they offer is real, true, actual zoom on a smartphone. It's only 2x optical zoom, plus digital zoom up to 10x, but it makes a big difference. Hiking in the redwoods, I'd take a snap from the ground, then zoom in and appear to be shooting from among the branches. I could also take portraits without standing creepy-close, which made friends and loved ones happy. Both cameras capture data every time you hit the shutter, and the images stitch together to achieve even more noise reduction and quality assurance.. The iPhone 7 Plus can't match a truly professional-level camera, but I've gotten more detail and richness from my photos than I can ever remember getting off a smartphone.. The iPhone really isn't a single device at all. When you buy a phone, you decide what it becomes by downloading apps. Your iPhone could be a Snapchat machine, or an Instagram factory, or a universal remote for your TV. The smartest thing Apple ever did with the iPhone was to imagine it as an empty vessel, waiting for users and developers to fill it with their homes and dreams and email apps.. All these years later, Apple's taking the blank-slate approach that led to the App Store to the rest of the iPhone. It's opening up APIs for RAW and wide-color image capture, which means photo apps could totally rethink how they process images. Developers can use the taptic engine to make games and apps more responsive and interactive. iOS 10 gives developers substantial access to Siri (and thus AirPods), along with Messages, Maps, and more. The iPhone's role is increasingly to be a blank canvas, one that developers can fill however they please.. It's a strategically smart move that makes for boring hardware. A phone that's meant to be tweaked and twisted can't cause problems by breaking or dying prematurely. It can't turn off buyers with controversial or complex design. It needs enough power and versatility to live up to a developer's most outrageous dreams. In other words, it's the iPhone 7.. So, no, the iPhone 7 won't blow your mind with its design or features. And philosophically, it feels like Apple is throwing open a door. The iPhone 7 might not be a revolution, but it might be the catalyst for lots of them. Your phone will be better in a few months, and even better a few months after that. You know what I don’t miss anymore? The headphone jack. I keep a bunch of dongles with me just in case, but I hardly ever need them. My car has a USB port, my headphones have no cables, and the iPhone 7 charges so fast that the whole “I can’t charge and talk at the same time” problem hasn’t really been one. Besides, there are at least two handfuls of really good wireless headphones, and you won’t regret making the leap when you do.. There aren’t many surprises to the iPhone 7, really. I’ve had my phone in the shower, been caught in a rainstorm, and had it poolside, all without a problem. Lots of apps have updated to add widgets, goof around in iMessage, and make 3D Touch useful. iOS still feels like a more modern app ecosystem than Android. (Super Mario Run is out!) Since September, the other big change has been to the iPhone 7 Plus, which got a software update that enabled the soft-focus features from the dual cameras. I’m sure you’ve seen it on Instagram. Personally, I think the effect looks fake and bad, but lots of other people love it.. Surprise! But not long after it came out it met its steepest competition in years, in the form of the Google Pixel , the best Android phone ever made. For the first time in a long time, I suspect Apple is looking over its shoulder. Meanwhile, 2017 will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and the rumor mill is already flying. This year’s update was excellent but sort of unexciting, but next year’s might change that..

They were announced on September 7, 2016, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco by Apple CEO Tim Cook , and were released on September 16, 2016, succeeding the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as the flagship devices in the iPhone series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus on September 22, 2017, and the iPhone X on November 3, 2017.. The iPhone 7's overall design is similar to the iPhone 6S, but introduces new color options, water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, and removes the 3.5. The device's internal hardware also received upgrades, including a heterogeneous quad-core system-on-chip with improved system and graphics performance, and upgraded 12. megapixel rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models and an additional telephoto lens on the iPhone 7 Plus model to provide enhanced zoom capabilities.. Reception of the iPhone 7 was mixed. Although reviewers noted the improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, they also stated that the iPhone 7 did not make significant changes to the display or build quality, where competing flagship smartphones surpassed the quality of the iPhone 7. Many reviews highlighted the controversial removal of the 3.5. mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary Lightning connector and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for Phil Schiller 's statement that such a drastic change required "courage".. The iPhone 7 has been the subject of several reported issues, most notably a hissing noise during heavy usage of the phones and significant differences in performance between device variants. Apple has not released sales numbers for iPhone 7, but multiple U.S. carriers reported that it was in high demand on launch. Subsequent reports at the end of 2016 stated that Apple had reduced production of the models due to "sluggish" sales and decreasing demand, though sales research after the first quarter of 2017 placed the devices as the best-selling smartphones in the world.. 3.1 Removal of the headphone jack. 4.3 Explosions and smoke emissions. 4.4 Perception of slogan in Cantonese-speaking regions. 4.5 Replacing the home button. 4.6 Failure to connect to cellular service. 5.1 US carrier trade-in deals. 5.2 Reports about trimmed production. 6 Timeline of iPhone models. Prior to its official announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumored. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5. mm headphone jack received significant media attention. [15] [16] [17] [18] Other rumors included a flush camera, stereo speakers, a thinner Lightning port, [19] a 256. gigabyte storage option, and a larger 3,100 mAh battery. On August 29, 2016, invitations to a press event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco , California on September 7, 2016 were sent out to members of the media, prompting immediate speculation of the iPhone 7's upcoming announcement. [21] [22] The iPhone 7 was officially announced at that event, with pre-orders beginning September 9, and general availability on September 16. iPhone 7 launched in 30 new countries later in September, with further international rollouts throughout October and November 2016. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Indonesia was the last country to release the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with availability starting on March 31, 2017, following Apple's research and development investment in the country. On March 21, 2017, Apple announced an iPhone 7 with a red color finish (and white front), as part of its partnership with Product Red to highlight its AIDS fundraising campaign. It launched on March 24, 2017. In September 2017, Apple announced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as direct successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, [36] alongside the iPhone X. As of February 4, 2018, the NYPD has been rolling out about 600 phones per day to its officers, who get to choose between an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 7 Plus, switching from the failed Windows Phone. Currently, officers in Manhattan are taking part in the transition, but once that is complete, the rollout moves to Brooklyn and then Queens. The iPhone 7's exterior is similar in shape and volume to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. Alongside the existing silver, gold, and rose gold colors, the device is offered in new matte black, "jet black", [23] and red colors. [34] [35] The "jet black" color is a dark shade, high-gloss black finish. It is created through a multi-step process, beginning with an anodization phase to make the surface of the casing a porous aluminum oxide , and then using a machine to sweep the casing through a powdered compound, absorbed by aluminum oxide. The process is concluded with an "ultrafine particle bath" for additional finishing; the entire process takes less than an hour. iPhone 7 is rated IP67 water and dust resistant , [40] although tests have resulted in malfunctions, specifically distorted speakers, after water exposure. [41] The warranty does not cover any water damage to the phone. iPhone 7's home button uses a capacitive mechanism for input rather than a physical push-button, as on previous models, meaning direct skin contact (or a capacitive glove) is required to operate the device. [43] [44] Physical feedback is provided via a Taptic Engine vibrator, and the button is also pressure-sensitive. [45] iPhone 7 retains the "3D Touch" display system introduced on the iPhone 6S, providing pressure-sensitive touchscreen input. Comparison of ports on iPhone 6/6S (top) and iPhone 7 (bottom). The iPhone 7 does not feature a 3.5. mm headphone jack ; it was replaced by a second speaker grille that serves as a vent for the internal barometer. [46] A Lightning -to-3.5-mm-connector adapter, as well as in-ear headphones that use the Lightning connector, are bundled with the device, [23] and the adapter is also sold separately as an accessory. [47] The adapter is also compatible with other iPhone, iPad , and iPod Touch devices running iOS 10. iPhone 7 uses the Apple A10 Fusion 64-bit system-on-chip , which consists of two low-power cores and two high-power cores (only two cores are used at any point in time [49] ). The A10 chip also features a hexa-core graphics chip capable of "console-level gaming". [50] As with prior models, iPhone 7 is available in two sizes: one with a 4.7-inch screen, and a "Plus" variant with a 5.5-inch screen. [51] The displays have identical sizes and resolutions to iPhone 6S, but with a wider color gamut [23] and increased brightness. [52] The screen-to-body ratio is about ~66% and ~68% for the 7 and 7 Plus, respectively. Both device variants also contain a new iteration of Apple's motion coprocessor , the M10. [55] Unlike previous iPhone models, internal storage options for iPhone 7 begin at 32. GB, and max out at 256. [56] iPhone 7 Plus offers 3. GB of RAM, more than any other previous iPhone; [49] the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 has 2. iPhone 7 Plus with dual-lens camera. The iPhone 7 includes a 12- megapixel rear-facing camera with a quad-LED "True Tone" flash; its aperture was widened to f/1.8, and the standard-size phone model adds optical image stabilization. – a feature that was previously exclusive to Plus models. [58] The iPhone 7 Plus includes a second 12-megapixel telephoto lens , which can be used to achieve 2× optical zoom , and up to 10× digital zoom. The front-facing camera was upgraded to a 7-megapixel sensor with automatic image stabilization. See also: iOS version history , iOS 10 , and iOS 11. iPhone 7 ships with iOS 10 pre-installed. [60] The iPhone 7 Plus received an exclusive portrait camera mode in the iOS 10.1 software update. [61] This camera mode is capable of producing a bokeh effect using depth of field analysis. Headphone jack adapter with an iPhone 7 Plus beside it. iPhone 7 unboxed set in Silver. Each iPhone 7 comes with a Lightning-to-3.5-mm adapter. [23] Apple sells the adapter independently as well. [47] Apple also unveiled several Bluetooth wireless headphones ostensibly intended for use with iPhone 7, including AirPods , wireless in-ear headphones, and three new Beats headphone products. All four products utilize an in-house wireless chip known as Apple W1 , which is designed to provide low-power Bluetooth operation and integration with iOS and macOS products (though they are still compatible with other Bluetooth-supported devices). Back and side detail from a standard iPhone 7 in "rose gold" finish. Back and front detail from a standard iPhone 7 in "RED" finish. Dual cameras on the back of the iPhone 7 Plus. Reception to the iPhone 7 was mixed. Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that rival smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 , had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and Nexus 6P. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S , was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that "the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display". Nilay Patel of The Verge described the devices as being "full of aggressive breaks from convention" despite their design continuity with previous models (going as far as dubbing them "a prototype of next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign disguised as an iPhone 6"), citing the headphone jack removal (which he felt was an attempt to encourage the use of wireless headphones ), heterogeneous CPU, and home button redesign. The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit "not as insane" as the quad HD displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the "first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years" (as opposed to the "gimmick" of 3D Touch ), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a "step" above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple "took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem." Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were "legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal. And the batteries last longer." [66]. John McCann of TechRadar wrote that for the first time, the phablet-sized iPhone 7 Plus was "markedly better" than the smaller model. He highlighted improved battery life and praised the camera, calling the Plus' dual cameras "excellent" for point-and-shoot, and "much improved" for low-light performance. McCann wrote that the lack of a headphone jack was "initially frustrating", but noted that it was a "positive step forward for the mobile industry", despite the "short-term effects ... making the most noise for now". Criticism of the iPhone 7 centered around the removal of the headphone jack, including the inability to use wired headphones with the included adapter and charge the device simultaneously. In a particularly scathing article, Nilay Patel of The Verge wrote that removing the headphone jack - "ditching a deeply established standard" - would be "user-hostile and stupid". He goes on to list reasons why removing the port is negative, concluding with "No one is asking for this" and "Vote with your dollars". Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that wireless audio technology was immature at the moment, with Bluetooth audio quality being inferior while Lightning audio reliability was still in question. The removal of the headphone jack meant "you’re being pushed into an era where you will have to pay more for decent headphones due to their need for an integrated DAC and/or Lightning licensing", and pointed out that "the only company to profit from this situation is Apple, who will now be charging licensing fees to millions of headphone companies". In particular, Apple's vice president Phillip Schiller , who announced the change, was mocked extensively online for stating that removing the headphone jack took 'courage'. [71] [72] An online petition created by the consumer group SumOfUs , that accuses Apple of planned obsolescence and causing substantial electronic waste by removing the headphone jack, [73] reached over 300,000 signatures. Some users have reported a strange hissing noise during heavy usage of the phone. CNET reports it as "faint buzzes and hums coming from the backside". [75] The Daily Telegraph speculates that the iPhone 7's new A10 Fusion processor is the source of the noise, linking to tweets that compare the phone's hissing sound to "hearing the fans spin up loudly whenever your Mac’s CPU gets used to its actual potential." [76] The issue has been referred to as Hissgate. The Guardian reported in October 2016 that storage tests from Unbox Therapy and GSMArena showed that the 32 GB iPhone 7 is "significantly" slower than the 128 and 256 GB versions, measuring data write speeds of 341 MB/s on a 128 GB iPhone 7 model versus 42 MB/s on a 32 GB model. [79] October 2016 network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A1660 and A1661 with Qualcomm modems had "a significant performance edge" over models A1778 and A1784 with Intel modems. Inspection of the modems also found that the Qualcomm version's ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off, likely to "level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel variants". The report concluded with the statement that "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone". [80] [81] Bloomberg reported in November 2016 that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U.S. cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing ... In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models". Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that "[Apple] don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better" and that "This may not impact the fanboys , but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product". In a similar manner with the now-discontinued Samsung Galaxy Note 7 , there have been reports of the iPhone 7 exploding or emitting smoke. In September 2016, one device reportedly exploded while in transit, [83] [84] while another one had a "malfunction that caused the battery to blow up internally". [85] Another report about an iPhone 7 emitting smoke and "melting" was published in October 2016. The iPhone 7's "This is 7" slogan has been misunderstood when translated to certain other languages. The slogan in China translates to "7, is here.", while it becomes "Exactly is 7." in Taiwan, and "This, is exactly iPhone 7." in Hong Kong. In the Cantonese language, the slogan becomes "This is penis ", due to "seven" pronounced tsat , a slang for "penis". In the iPhone 7, Apple added a software lock that prevents individuals from attempting to replace the home button on their own. Users are now required to go to an Apple Store to have repairs done, with "recalibration" of the button being necessary. This is a step further than Apple went with iPhone 5S, 6 and 6S, where only Touch ID functionality would get disabled but the "return-to-home" functionality still worked. Some iPhone 7 devices with the model numbers A1660, A1780 and A1779 suffer from a problem where they show a "No service" message even when cellular reception is available. Apple will repair those devices for free within two years of the first retail sale of the unit. Apple has deliberately withheld pre-order sales numbers, citing that these are "no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers". [92] Without releasing specific numbers, T-Mobile US stated that the iPhone 7 had broken the carrier's all-time record for first-day pre-order sales. The following weekend, T-Mobile US stated that iPhone 7 was its biggest iPhone launch ever, being "up nearly 4x compared to the next most popular iPhone". On September 14, 2016, two days before the iPhone 7 went on sale, Apple announced that due to high demand, they had sold out of all "jet black" iPhone 7's, and all colors of the iPhone 7 Plus. [94] This caused issues for customers in the iPhone Upgrade Program , who were unable to reserve new phones. [95] After customer complaints and a class action lawsuit, [96] Apple made changes to ensure members of the program could get new phones as soon as possible. In May 2017, analytics research company Strategy Analytics announced that iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were the best-selling smartphones worldwide during the first quarter of 2017, selling 21.5. sales of the iPhone 7, all four major wireless carriers announced trade-in deals. Under the deals, the monthly installment plan cost of the iPhone 7 is negated by a monthly credit on consumers' bill, but consumers who cancel their service with the carrier or pay off the phone prior to the installment contract completion will not receive credits for the remaining months. [100] Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge noted that the deals effectively constituted a return to two-year phone contracts, in which the deals "essentially lock you into that carrier for two years". In the wake of these deals, Verizon announced they had seen an increase in sales over the release of the previous year's iPhone 6S, AT&T said that sales had exceeded its expectations, and T-Mobile and Sprint announced "huge increases in sales", with T-Mobile seeing a demand roughly four times higher for the 7 than the 6. In December 2016, DigiTimes reported that Apple had reduced production of the iPhone 7 because of decreasing demand for the product after the initial surge of interest waned. A reason cited was consumers and suppliers turning their attention to next year's iPhone model. A new report from Nikkei at the end of December included details on sales and production of the iPhone 7. The report, "based on data from suppliers", stated that Apple would trim production of the iPhone 7 by 10% in the first quarter of 2017, following "sluggish" sales. Nikkei reported that Apple previously trimmed production of the iPhone 7 by 20% due to accumulated inventory of the previous model , but that the new models had "sold more sluggishly than expected". Additionally, the report notes that the "iPhone 7 Plus, which features two cameras on its back face, remains popular", but "a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the phones".

The iOS10 upgrade is no expected (expected to work well) on old iPhone handsets. We have seen this trend in past when Apple user were able to update iPhone 4 to iOS 7 but iPhone 3GS iOS 7 update was not supported. Some users were able to get iOS 7 on iPhone 3GS through jailbreak method but it failed to perform well. Everyone from MacWorld , AppleInsider and iPhone7buzz to GSMarena and Forbes is busy publishing iPhone 7 rumors and iPhone 7 news. Let's go through the iPhone rumors and know when when is the next iPhone coming out with its specifications, features, price and availability:. iPhone 7 Release Date, Price, Specification Rumors Reviewing Apple iPhone 7's release dates and price, the first million dollar question is obviously about the new iPhone 7 release date that when does iPhone 7 come out? then comes the new iPhone 7 specifications and price or anything else. iPhone 7 Release Date Traditionally, Apple releases new cellphones versions, every year in 3rd quarter. With other factors remain normal, Q3/16 will the time when one should expect next iPhone 7 and may be iPod touch 7th generation too. The iPhone 7 confirmed release date is only know to Apple, as officially disclosed through iPhone 7 ad/commercial advertisement. But it is safe to say that the expected iPhone 7 release date in USA is first Friday of September , 2016. iPhone 5S release date with iPhone 5C was 10 September 2013. iPhone 6 release date with iPhone 6 Plus was 19 September 2014. iPhone 6S release date with iPhone 6S Plus was 9 September 2015. iPhone 7 release date with iPhone 7 Plus is 9 September 2016 ( expected ). Apple iPhone 7 Preorder tracker is up online on iPhone 7 apple website, right after the official unveiling event. The upcoming iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus public release on Apple Stores is expected on 25 September, 2016. The iPhone 7 availability on Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and few other online stores are also expected soon. iPhone 7 Price After iPhone launch date, the second question arises about the next iPhone 7 Cost/Price. Apple is known to have an almost consistent price model over the several iPhone generations. We expect the same for iPhone 7 pricing. Apple iPhone 7 price in US is going to be $649 for the base model. Whereas, an iPhone 7 Plus will cost $649 USD. Compared to iPhone 7 price in US in dollars, iPhone 7 price in UK comes out to be expensive. Apple iPhone 7 32GB model cost in UK is expected to be £539 for a factory unlocked phone.Below are the expected iPhone 7 prices in other countries:. iPhone 7 Price in United States is 649 US Dollars (USD). iPhone 7 Price in Canada is 899 Canadian Dollars (CAD). iPhone 7 Price in United Kingdom is 539 Pounds (GBP). iPhone 7 Price in France is 749 Euros (EUR). iPhone 7 Price in Germany is 739 Euros (EUR). iPhone 7 Price in Australia is 1079 Australian Dollars (AUD). iPhone 7 Price in New Zealand is 1199 New Zealand Dollars (NZ). iPhone 7 Price in Japan 86800 Japanese Yens (JPY). iPhone 7 Price in China 5288 Chinese Yuans (RMB). iPhone 7 Price in Hong Kong is 5588 Honk Kong dollars (HK). iPhone 7 Price in Singapore is 1048 Singapore Dollars (SGD). iPhone 7 Price in India is 49999 Indian Rupees (INR). iPhone 7 Price in Pakistan is 69999 Pakistani Rupees (PKR). iPhone 7 Price in Bangladesh is 51499 Taka (BDT). You can see that best iPhone 7 price is United States with France being the most costly one. Apple has begun accepting iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 pre-orders before it becomes available on stores. iPhone 7 Specification and Features When you thought you had seen it all with iPhone 6 and the yet to be released iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S plus release in 2015, then you are sure to be even amazed with iPhone 7 features that Apple is going to offer you with its 7th generation iPhone in 2016 when it will hit the market. Larger Display with Home Button iPhone 7 big screen is least expected. Apple iPhone 7 compared to iPhone 6 is far better device but not on display size. There are several manufacturing quality complaints received regarding poor manufacturing of iPhone 6 with bendgate issues. Apple will surely work on this and get your more user friendly screen options with better build quality in next generation iPhone display technology. With Apple iPhone 7, an edge to edge screen can be on cards, as most of phablet surface to be a screen leaving slight room for the physical home button below. However an iPhone 7 all glass build is an unlikely to be true rumor. Next Gen i Phone 7 with 16MP Camera Apple iPhone 7th generation is expected to feature a 16MP iSight camera with 4K recording and a 5MP front facing camera might not be a big deal for iPhone 7 camera specs. Apple iPhone 7 A10 Processor As the storage capacity and technology of the Apple iPhone 7 increased you will also need a fast iPhone 7 CPU to carry on your activities, hence we are expecting apple to use much advanced processor for example quard core A10 chip or better. iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Sizes Few iPhone 7 rumors suggest Apple is aiming to make i iPhone 7 thinner, by removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack and the implementation of a thinner Lightning port. Some other Apple leaks suggest that company want device to go wireles for music using iPhone 7 bluetooth headphones. But these rumors are not confirmed. 256GB Memory with iPhone 7 Storage capacity of Apple iPhone 7 is expected to increase up-to 256 GB model, which is much more than current versions on iPhone. You never know, apple may come up with the technology which allows you to do unlimited storage. Apple iPhone 7 5G Connectivity With the release of any new Apple iPhone device new iPhone features and functions has always been the end result and this is sure to be with aiPhone 7. Apple iPhone 7 going to include support for telecommunications standards beyond the current 4G/IMT-Advanced standards. Apple iPhone 7 will support 5G network both on Verizon and AT&T 5G networks. iPhone 7 Projector iPhone 7 is the future Smartphone with Futuristic features and specs. This is even more exciting with rumors suggesting it will include an integrated projector. This is a possibility as Apple was thought to be working on building an in built projector to feature in its iOS devices like iPhone and iPad. Building of a projector inside a device is sure to bring lots of reactions from experts and fans due to the sole reason of the amount of power the device will need to have so as to run it. The fact remains; it will be a cool feature if Apple is able to perfectly install this feature while still maintaining the viability and efficiency of the device in terms of power. If it becomes a reality then it is sure to be the appealing feature with many people. The rumors even get ripe with Apples filling patent for the Projector. Detailed diagrams surfaced clearly showing Apple devices iPhone and iPad projecting directly onto a wall while laying flat on a table.. The diagrams also indicated that Apple must be working on an external projector to be used solely in MacBooks. The external projector will be USB Based. iPhone 7 Waterproof Apple has been ahead of the rivals most of the times when it comes to bring innovation with every new iPhone. Samsung had already delivred waterproof and dust-proofing in Samsung S7 edge release and other devices. Therefore, some analyst believe, the next-generation iPhone 7 will be waterproofed and dustproof to IP68 standards. iPhone 7 Flexible Display IBTimes published some Apple iPhone 7 images and video with crazy flexible widescreen display and curved edges. While a flexible iPhone 7 concept sounds amazing to girls, the idea is very unlikely to see the light of the day. No offense, just kidding ladies! good news is that iPhone 7 accessories partners are coming up with awesome iPhone 7 Cases for Girls , may be as consolation ;-). iPhone 7 battery Capacity iPhone 7 with be powered by the new longer battery technology that make use of organic materials to replace Li-On batteries. Apple iPhone 7 battery capacity will be extended with a new and highly capable battery that is sure to accommodate all the additional features that iPhone 7th generation is to feature. iPhone 7 iOS 10 with More Applications You can surely expect another thousand of very useful features and updates in Apple iPhone 7 thanks to iOS 10. As the With iPhone 7 announcement date With iPhone 7 announcement date is approaching, Apple developers are working really hard on iPhone 7 clone devices, doing iPhone 7 beta testing and bug fixing, to make more useful applications which will make your iPhone better than other similar brands. Most of the new Apple iPhone 7 features come from iOS 10 software. As seen in iOS 10 beta, the iOS 10 features list includes improved Siri with voice mails features, improved 3D Touch, Apple's Home app and Customizable Control Center. Siri can tell a caller why you can't pick up the phone and even transcribe voicemail messages so you can read them on the go or in loud venues. Apple's Home App will transform for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV into remotes for smart bulbs, door locks, thermostats, door bells and all sorts of gadgets that fall into the Internet of Things classification. Apple Music gets rockstar facelift of its user interface with black-and-white menus and bigger artwork that stands out among the muted colors. Features realted to song lyrics in the new iOS 10 are also on cards. Apple 3D Touch or force touch technology gets expanded to control center, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on-screen button too. Sliding opaque menus into view without requiring to exit apps will also expand to Control Center buttons. Customizable Control Center is possible. Instead of forcing use to have the fixed icon shortcuts, user will be able to arrange icons based on his/her preferences. Multi-User Support long given by Android, was still missing on Apple devices. iOS 10 is the time to do it. Smartphone products draw inspiration from community ideas. Consumer products made in isolation without taking market flavors into consideration, are unlikely to become success. Some of you guys, regularly following apple thing, might still remember the huge buzz created by the wonderful iPhone 5 infographic in 2012, by Düne and Soso from French blog NoWhereElse. It summarized all the iPhone rumors and possibilities in a single image with percentage of likelihood. Therefore, all the sensible iPhone concept images, creative infographics,rumors and apple leaks somehow play their role in shaping and sharing of user expectation. Which in turn influence that tech product development. Apple has consistently set the pace and trends in the smartphone business with iPhone 5S, making it even bigger and better with iPhone 6. This trend is expected to stay consistent beyond iPhone 7 arrival, even with next iPhone 7S and iPhone 8 releases.. iPhone 7 Release Date, Price, Specification Rumors. Working for top HealthIT solution provider in US; I'm an IT expert, Webpreneur, Tech blogger, Avid reader and dreamer. With more than a decade of experience in Software, Web and Mobile development; these are my two cents. Please feel free to share yours !. Jio dth registration, dth online booking. Bsnl toll free customer care number. Bob, do you seriously consider iPhone 7 an impossibility? Come on dude, its not fiction, we are taking about some this which is very much there. Every science graduate knows that for a technology company there is no survival without Research and Development. Let take a very basic idea of the Product Life cycle. Be it Software or Hardware, if one version is in the market, next is in manufacturing pipeline and next to next is in the Lab under R&D. That’s how the miracles of technology work. A cell phone in also a miracle of technology. It takes years in Lab, months in Manufacturing and Quality Assurance and weeks in Supply Chains before reaching your hand. So let’s wait with our fingers crossed, after iPhone 5 launched, Apple iPhone 7 is a near future reality I would again humbly say!. hey you guize hear about duke nukem forever 2?. do you have any idea of how much it will cost now ??. iPhone 7? This is so 2011. I'm reporting on iPhone 12 already.. I really wanted the iPhone 5, but it turns out that my dad was right. Every year, there will always be a new version that I want. But I saw a picture of an iPhone and it was like invisible, until you touch the screen. I saw a video on YouTube and I KNEW it had to be true. I saw it with my own eyes! So I was just wondering which iPhone has that invisible feature? And which iPhone is coming out this year (2012)? And does the iPhone that's coming out in 2012 have this invisible feature? Someone please answer!. All those videos are 100% fake its called special effects. Unlimited memory will be impossible unless the cloud is used. but the cloud is too insecure for that. that geeky scientists are already carrying around iPhone 7, 8, and possibly 9. This article is so last year. I'll live to see more than 50 more iPhones. I Guess! The next generation u or I phone will be the first and last outcome of human intellectual. Because developers and top scientist thinking to make it easy and integrate all that need for public, private and Government in one touch without making trip to concerned office or organization or even shopping. In my perspective, this is my qualified thinking. In addition, super-fast and handy ecological and pollution free equipment and software are going to be useful for children, youths and elders overall population of the world keeping in mind of all religions, casts and sects along with Entertainment, Education, Spiritual and ignorance around the world also. better apple can create an application of hologram the same in iron man or in g.i joe,. can you tell me the release date of iphone 7. Have it all and get it fast with the Samsung Galaxy Rush. Android 4.1 and Google Play™ make customizing a snap. I've been talking with people who work at Apple. The said they are definitely keeping the cell screen, so it won't be possible for it to be "see through".. "Apple has consistently set the pace and trends in the smartphone business with iPhone 5S, making it even bigger and better with iPhone 6." No they haven't. As a matter of fact, they have been playing behind the 8-ball consistently, but thanks to a crack marketing team, they've been able to act like they've got the best thing since sliced bread. Need proof? NFS was released in the iPhone 6, paving the way for Apple Pay. It was a huge leap in the way we will be doing business, and Apple was the first to use it! Oh, wait, it was out for a year from Samsung (Galaxy S5) and in a few other smartphones before then. There were already apps out there to handle payments like that. But the iPhone 6 can have up to 128 GB of memory! Well, so could the Galaxy S5, with 32 GB internal, and max supported 128GB with SDcard. But, the iPhone was the first commercial smartphone! Well, not really, since technically Blackberries were in heavy use, and performed many of the same functions that the iPhone did. In fact, until iOS 4, the iPhone was much more limited than the BB. Also, the Palm Treo was in the market since 2002. Also, it took Apple three iterations of the iOS to integrate copy/paste, something that even the Motorola V60, a flip phone, had in 2001. Also, not to mention that we didn't have LTE on our iPhones until the iPhone 5, after LTE had been around for 3 years already. The Motorola Droid RAZR came out well before the 5, and it had LTE. The only truth to the new specs will be that it will be an A10 processor. It will probably ship with iOS 10, but the rest of the rumors are bogus. Want to see what the iPhone 7 will have? Look at the Galaxy S6 with a worse screen and less battery life. Oh, but the corners will be *nice.*.
