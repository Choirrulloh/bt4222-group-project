CNET también está disponible en español.. A new contender for the midrange crown. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Oppo R9s' 16-megapixel front and rear cameras are all-star performers. It'll go for days on a single charge, and has custom gesture controls.. The Bad You'll feel the phone's midrange design in its sharp-edged aluminium body and some clunky software navigation.. The Bottom Line Oppo's R9s battery life and camera make it a great midprice buy, even if it isn't as buttery-smooth as more upmarket phones.. Key specs 5.5 inch, 1,920x1,080-pixel screen 16-megapixel front and rear cameras 4GB RAM Dual SIM Android 6.0 with ColorOS 3.0 64GB ROM, expandable to 256GB Fingerprint scanner. There are some good reasons to look past the Oppo R9s' alarmingly Apple-ish design. First, this follow-up to the Oppo R9 has got killer battery life. Second, the front and rear 16-megapixel cameras are serious business. And third, you can pick up the R9s for a fraction of flagship prices -- AU$600 (around $435 or £350, converted).. The phone does have some shortcomings, like actual rough edges and a needlessly complicated interface, but it's hard to beat the R9s' excellent camera, long battery life and price.. Both front and rear 16-megapixel cameras are some of the R9s' biggest selling points. Developed in conjunction with Sony, the zippy shutter speed, admirable low-light performance and full slew of features and camera modes hit all the sweet spots. Beauty Mode, which is Oppo's custom selfie filter, warrants special mention for making you look amazing. Honestly, don't take selfies without it. Join me in lying to yourself.. The R9s' battery life is outstanding. In testing, it clocked in at just under 16 hours of continuous video playback, which puts it on par with our pick of the midrange, the OnePlus 3T , and hours ahead of the Pixel and iPhone 7. Anecdotally, even an obsessive watcher of battery life like me got a very comfortable two days before I was scrambling for the charging cord.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Camera lives up to the hype. Super fast VOOC charging provides a 75% charge in 30 minutes. Unlocked dual-SIM support is great to have. Sloppy software with inconsistent design language. Ships with Marshmallow and is moderately unlikely to be updated. Strange display coating makes cleaning off fingerprints difficult. Not sold in the United States. Although its camera is the best we've seen at this price point, the OPPO R9s has too many other issues for us to recommend it over competing options. If you're looking for a great camera, we suggest that you either compromise a bit with an alternative mid-range smartphone or pay more for a true flagship.. Processor 2.0GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625. Cameras Rear: 16MP with f/1.7 aperture, 1.12µm pixel size. Dimensions and weight 153 x 74.3 x 6.6mm. OPPO may not have the same level of brand recognition in the West as Huawei or ZTE , but they’ve long dominated the Chinese market. That should come as no surprise too, given their track record of launching impressive smartphones like the R7 , N3 , and Find 7 .. Best unlocked Android phones (February 2018). Now that an increasing amount of smartphone manufacturers are selling their phones at cheaper price points, it's much easier for consumers to afford an off-contract device rather than purchasing one with a two-year contract. Best cheap phones ($500 and under). There are a lot of great phones out there, but the reality is many of them cost well over $500. In 2017 we even saw flagships reach the $1,000 mark. So what if you want …. It’s quite evident that OPPO is hoping to continue their successful trend with the comfortably mid-range OPPO R9s, a follow-up to last year’s R9. The question is, should you consider the OPPO R9s over similarly priced options like the ZTE Axon 7 , the Honor 8 , or the OnePlus 3T ? Now is the time to take a closer look with our OPPO R9s review!. It that really an Android? It looks a lot like an iPhone!. During my time with the R9s, I was frequently asked questions along the lines of “It that really an Android? It looks a lot like an iPhone !” Perhaps I shouldn’t criticize the phone identification skills (or lack thereof) of others in this case. The R9s does look a lot like the iPhone, from its identically-shaped body to its unmistakably similar speaker grill.. There’s also an iPhone-esque silver ring around the home button, and, yes, to truly take inspiration from Apple means to also include the notorious rear camera bump. Don’t fret too much, though, as that bump is only mildly annoying when tapping the top left part of the display on hard flat surfaces.. Oddly enough, the antenna lines on this model are a notable departure from the preceding R9’s solid lines. OPPO’s intention here may have been to distance themselves from Apple. In any case, OPPO isn’t fooling anyone with their design tactics.. In any case, OPPO isn't fooling anyone with their design tactics. Joking aside, the R9s’ design is indeed quite nice despite its derivative nature. It’s remarkably thin and light at 6.6mm and 145g, both of which measures undercut comparable iPhone models.. The R9s’ build quality is where this design truly shines. The all-metal body is well tried-and-tested to say the least, as it offers both a premium look and premium in-hand feel. This is becoming increasingly important for mid-range devices like the OPPO R9s, as consumers demand even more for their money.. Thankfully, the small touches appear to have received the same high level of attention. The sides buttons are nice and tactile. Small details like these are sometimes overlooked but are perhaps just as important, so OPPO’s level of focus here is great to see.. Since the R9s’ capacitive home button includes an embedded fingerprint reader, you can simply touch the button to unlock the phone or authorize certain apps or purchases. It seems that the R9s is using the same reader as the OnePlus 3T , given that both OPPO and OnePlus are owned by parent company BBK Electronics.. The R9s' fingerprint reader is really fast. Regardless, the R9s’ fingerprint reader is really fast while maintaining a high level of accuracy. This is one of the best experiences available to date, which is especially impressive when considering the R9s’ price.. To the sides of the home button are two illuminated keys: multitask and back, respectively. The illumination could be a tad brighter, but certainly does the job in most situations. Although the layout is the opposite of the back-home-multitask standard layout, some prefer having the back button on the right side, including myself.. Thankfully, excellent displays have become the norm for anything priced more than about $300. And, for the most part, the OPPO R9s’ display lives up to my expectations. This model’s screen is sized at 5.5-inches, although if you’re looking for something slightly larger, the 6.0-inch OPPO R9s Plus might be worth considering.. The display size translates to an average handling experience, helped marginally by the remarkably small side bezels. Those bezels are quite stylish too, although it’s worth mentioning that the black border around the display does detract some of that beauty.. Colors appear very punchy and oversaturated. Since it is an AMOLED panel, colors appear very punchy and oversaturated. Many people prefer this look, however, as it makes everything look quite vibrant. There’s also a bundled “eye protection mode” accessible from either the quick toggles or the settings, which adjusts the color temperature to be warmer or more yellow.. This thereby reduces the amount of blue light, which is said to be bad before bedtime. While I’m unaware of substantial research that concludes that this actually improves sleep, it certainly seems that it couldn’t hurt.. The display’s brightness level range is about what I expected. It’s low enough for darker environments, and high enough for some outdoor environments. If it’s blue skies and sunny though, you might have some trouble reading the display. For reference, it’s brighter than the Axon 7’s display , but falls short of the OnePlus 3T’s display .. Also read: ZTE Axon 7 review. OPPO has implemented Corning Gorilla Glass 5 , which provides protection against both scratches and drops. Sadly, I found the display to scratch surprisingly easily.. The display coating is dangerously close to being a deal-breaker. I also noticed a very strange display coating on both of my review units, which makes the glass an absolute fingerprint magnet. This is the worst display for fingerprints that I’ve used in recent memory, as smudges linger even after cleaning. While this will surely annoy people to varying degrees, I personally find this to be dangerously close to being a deal-breaker.. With the R9s, OPPO has made a switch from the Mediatek Helio P10 to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625. Although I never had the chance to use the R9 specifically, I have used several smartphones with the Helio P10. Based on my experiences with both chips, I think this is a small but certainly welcomed upgrade. There’s also 4GB of RAM, so you should have no trouble with moderate to heavy multitasking.. Day-to-day performance is good, but not great. During my time with R9s, I didn’t really take issue with its minor sluggishness, but I definitely understand that some may be looking for something a bit snappier. The Snapdragon 625 is a firmly mid-range chip, so it’s expectedly not as impressive as the high-end Snapdragon 820 and Snapdragon 821 in both day-to-day performance and benchmark scores.. If you’re doing enough research to be reading this review, chances are that you’ll see this as a considerable drawback. Since the ZTE Axon 7 and the OnePlus 3T ship with the 820 and 821, however, this puts the R9s behind of the pack in the performance category. It’s a somewhat minor difference, but if you’re doing enough research to be reading this review, chances are that you’ll see this as a considerable drawback.. Good news for travelers or anyone wishing to use multiple phone numbers: similar to many options coming out of China, the OPPO R9s is an unlocked dual-SIM smartphone. If you don’t plan on taking advantage of this feature, you can instead use the extra slot for a microSD card, up to 256 GB. The R9s does include 64GB of storage out of the box though, so you may end up not having to worry about storage at all.. Unfortunately for many of our readers, the OPPO R9s has limited 4G LTE support. In the United States, for example, you’ll be stuck with 3G on both AT&T and T-Mobile (and their MVNOs), which is possibly this phone’s biggest drawback for Western users as the R9s’ primary competitors all include support for US 4G LTE.. It is important to keep in mind, though, that this phone will work wherever it is officially sold. The United States sadly just isn’t one of those markets.. The side-firing speaker on the OPPO R9s is reminiscent of the OnePlus 3T’s. The sound is about the same, but the audio quality does seem ever so slightly better here. It’s not nearly as good as the ZTE Axon 7’s dual stereo front-facing speaker setup, but it gets the job done.. Fortunately, OPPO has included a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you won’t be needing to transition to that dongle life with this device. There’s also a neat equalizer included, dubbed Real HD sound. OPPO states that this feature was developed in cooperation with Dirac Research AB, “the world’s leading audio technology company.”. several profiles to switch between based on the genre of music you’re playing, but it would be even cooler if it included and switched to a video profile automatically. Currently, you have to dig fairly deep into the settings to turn it off, so if you’re like me and you’re switching between Spotify and YouTube frequently, you might be tempted to just turn it off completely as it does not sound very well when listening to normal speaking voices.. There's also a strange YouTube audio sync issue. There’s also a strange YouTube audio sync issue, which affects both headphone and speaker output. It could be worse, but constantly having audio delayed by even a split second might just drive you crazy.. I was a bit worried that the 3,010mAh non-removable battery wouldn’t be enough to power through a full day of use. However, it seems that OPPO has added effective battery life optimizations, as I was consistently able to get either one and a half days of usage with around four hours of screen-on time or one day of usage with around seven hours of screen-on time. Those are some pretty impressive numbers regardless of how you frame it.. My testing was performed while connected to 3G networks. Do keep in mind, however, that my testing was performed while connected to 3G networks, which is easier on the battery and therefore inflates these tests results. For what it’s worth, I also used the phone while connected to my college’s Wi-Fi network, which covers the entire campus very well with few “dead zones”, even outdoors. During these days, battery life was more or less the same, which is to say it was excellent.. When you do need to charge the R9s, you can take advantage of OPPO’s proprietary VOOC Fast Charging , which OPPO claims charges the phone from 0 to 75 percent in just thirty minutes. That’s a really impressive charge rate, especially when you consider how well VOOC handles heat dissipation. Much of the heat generated stays in the wall adapter, rather than making its way to the phone’s internals. Although Qualcomm Quick Charge has the advantage of being way more ubiquitous, it’s hard to argue with VOOC’s features.. Oh, MicroUSB, it seems like you just won’t go away; despite many smartphone manufacturers having already made the transition to the new reversible USB Type-C standard, OPPO is evidently still living in early 2015 with the R9s.. I suppose you might find this nice if you don’t wish to purchase new charging cables, but if you’ve already made the transition or would like the features that USB Type-C has to offer, you’ll be out of luck here. The phone's 'now, it's clear' tagline is a sort of a double entendre. OPPO has focused much of their marketing on the R9s’ camera. The phone’s “now, it’s clear” tagline is a sort of a double entendre, implying that the R9s offers clear photos which makes it the clear choice. It’s arguably a bit cheesy, but what’s much more important is whether the claim holds water.. The camera setup certainly looks pretty killer on paper. OPPO states that the R9s features a customized Sony IMX398 1/2.8 inch sensor, which is the second latest sensor from Sony at the time of writing. The IMX398 is actually making its debut with this phone, which is quite impressive for a mid-range smartphone. Anyway, this particular camera is a 16MP f/1.7 shooter. The pixel size is larger than average at 1.12µm, which translates to more light per pixel, which should help in low-light conditions.. So, what’s the verdict? Well, our sample images reveal that the R9s is somewhere in between the OnePlus 3T and Google Pixel XL. It’s better than everything we’ve seen at around $400 thus far, but doesn’t quite beat out the best shooters.. Most images shot in good lighting are quite impressive with natural-looking colors, balanced levels of saturation, and minimal noise and distortion. And, oh, are these images sharp! Combined with the sharp sensor and dual phase detection autofocus, it’s quite difficult to capture a blurry photo. The amount of detail that the R9s offers is spectacular, something which you can fully appreciate when viewing the images on a larger high resolution display. In this sense, OPPO’s marketing is well justified.. Dynamic range is only about average though, and HDR doesn’t really help in getting balanced shots of extreme highlights and shadows. In addition, the true to life color nature inevitably means that some images exhibit muted colors. Within perspective, however, these are some pretty minor complaints.. The camera holds up reasonably well in low-light conditions. Of course, the sensor has to deal with much less light, and as a consequence has to find a balance between sharpness and noise levels. That’s why many of our sample low-light images appear soft and slightly noisy, despite the fast aperture and larger pixel size. Perhaps optical image stabilization would have helped here by allowing for longer shutter speeds.. Perhaps optical image stabilization would have helped here by allowing for longer shutter speeds. Although the rear camera does support 4K video capture, I found the quality to be slightly below average. That’s a bit disappointing, so if you plan on doing more videography than photography, you may want to consider other options.. The front-facing 16MP f/2.0 camera is capable of delivering some very nice selfies. The built-in Beauty mode is also surprisingly balanced. The skin softening is kept at a reasonable level, therefore producing semi-natural looking shots.. Unsurprisingly, OPPO’s camera app takes a lot of inspiration from Apple’s. The interface makes it easy to quickly shoot images and the primary camera modes can be accessed directly from the main view. There are a few extra modes available too: Ultra HD, GIF, Expert Mode, Various Filters, and Double Exposure.. The “expert mode” is a bit quirky though; you can’t toggle back to autofocus without exiting and then re-entering the mode, you can only increment shutter speeds by seconds, and you can’t adjust processing levels like contrast and saturation.. OPPO’s desire to imitate Apple is heavily emphasized with their software. The R9s ships with ColorOS 3.0 over Android 6.0 Marshmallow , which provides a very iOS-like experience. In fact, any of the colors and design attributes are recognizably from iOS. OPPO’s software is also disappointing in the sense that it includes very few extra features and customizations compared to stock Android. It even strips some features like multi-user support and the ability to change different audio levels from a single menu.. The overall experience is decently polished, but I noticed a number of minor issues during my time with the phone. For example, when do not disturb is enabled, the time at the center top of the screen is replaced with “do not disturb”. In order to see the time, you have to first swipe down for the quick toggles and then swipe right to see the notification panel.. This decision was quite frankly idiotic. This decision was quite frankly idiotic, as I’m more likely to want to see the time during nightly do not disturb hours than I am during the day. The software already adds a moon icon next to the battery icon when do not disturb is enabled, so I’m perplexed by the reasoning behind this.. A few more minor complaints: you can’t see black text previews in notifications since the phone sets the color to dark gray instead of the default white, the settings icon appears “broken” near the bottom right, and putting the phone into developer mode can be a nightmare. You’re required to complete captcha each time you’d like to use it and you’ll be constantly reminded that it’s on with a flashing yellow banner at the top of the screen.. The cumulative look is quite frankly confusing. Thankfully, the phone doesn’t ship with any bloatware and only a standard set of system apps. Like the rest of the software, those apps are mediocre. My main gripe is the amount of design inconsistency between apps. It sometimes seems as if OPPO assigned each app to different teams and minimized communication between those teams. The cumulative look is quite frankly confusing and inevitably gives a strong impression of sloppy work.. It’s not that I don’t like Android skins. I’ve praised both MIUI and FlyMe quite extensively in the past for offering commendably polished experiences. For Western users, those skins are already a difficult sell, so it’s hard to imagine why anyone would choose this over OnePlus’ stock-like OxygenOS. OPPO’s ColorOS just doesn’t have the same amount of polish that other Android skins have.. Based on OPPO’s Android update history, we estimate the probability of the R9s receiving an Android 7.0 Nougat update to be moderately unlikely. Unfortunately, it looks like you’ll be stuck on the nearly one and a half year old Marshmallow for the lifetime of the phone.. The OPPO R9s is now available in either Gold or Rose Gold. In China, it retails for 2800 yuan or about $405. In Singapore, it can be picked up for a slightly more expensive S$680 or about $481. As mentioned previously, each model includes 64GB of internal storage which is expandable up to 256GB. It’s not officially available in the U.S., though you can pick one up from a third-party retailer like OPPOMART.. The OPPO R9s has an excellent camera, offers impressive battery life, and features a nice display. However, the number of compromises here is staggering. Among derivative design and software, the R9s has sloppy software, offers below average performance, and has a bleak software support outlook. For Western users, the strange display coating, YouTube audio sync issue, and limited availability are even bigger issues to consider.. While we greatly appreciate OPPO’s efforts to bring an excellent camera to this price point, we simply cannot recommend the R9s when options like the ZTE Axon 7 , the Honor 8 , and the OnePlus 3T are available at similar prices. If you’re looking for a great camera, we suggest that you either compromise a bit with one of these alternatives or pay more for a true flagship..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Apple face with an Android booty. Offering a flagship feel at half the price of its competitors, the Oppo R9s is one of the best mid-range handsets on the market, though don't expect stellar game performance.. Steadily climbing its way into the number one position among smartphone makers in China, Oppo has made a name for itself by offering customers premium-feeling handsets at half the price of the competition. With this strategy, it’s perhaps no surprise that the company owns 23 percent of the market share in its home country (by comparison, Apple currently holds a 6 percent market share in China).. Now, its latest handset, the Oppo R9s, has just launched in Australia, and we got our hands on one for review.. Looking at the Oppo R9s in its naked form, it’d be easy to mistake it for an iPhone 7 – its thin, rounded aluminium body, slightly-protruding camera bump, matte finish and similarly-placed buttons seem clearly modelled after the Apple flagship (though its pill-shaped capacitive home button gives its Android status away), as does its new iOS-aping ColorOS 3.0 software.. But what the phone may lack in design originality, it makes up for in sheer value. Though it has a retail price of AU$599 (around US$457 and £365), many of the hallmarks we’ve come to expect from a premium phone are present here.. With the R9s, Oppo has produced its most polished phone to date. Though its success in China is a given, does the Oppo R9s have what it takes to become the king of mid-range phones in the western world? Though it’s only non-Asian market is Australia at present, its success here could open up wider avenues for Oppo in the future. And if it doesn’t happen, it won’t be for fault of this impressive handset. So far, there's no word on when the Oppo R9s will arrive in the US and UK, but we'll keep you updated on any developments. However, it is currently available in Singapore at a price of S$679.. As was mentioned earlier, the iPhone 7 was a clear touchstone in the Oppo R9s’ design. Smooth and rounded, the only sharpness you’ll find here is in the screen’s edges, which aren’t quite as close to the handset as they are on Apple’s flagship. the Oppo R9s is 6.6mm thick, compared to the iPhone 7’s 7.1mm. It’s rather slippery in the hand, but thankfully, Oppo has included a clear silicone case and an already-applied screen protector with each handset.. Like the iPhone 7, the Oppo R9s has a capacitive touch home button which doubles as a fingerprint sensor, and while it doesn’t provide the faux ‘click’ sensation of Apple’s handset, it does offer a slight tremor when pressed. Where it does have Apple beat, however, is in its speed –. the Oppo R9s offers one of the fastest sensors we’ve ever experienced, seemingly unlocking the phone instantly. It’s also got a hydrophobic membrane over it which helps the sensor register your prints, even when your digits are moist.. Whether this means the sensor offers less security than its rivals is unknown, though after numerous attempts, no one other than myself was able to unlock the handset. Joining the home button are two capacitive ‘recents’ and ‘back’ buttons, which are set in that order from left to right –. Again, like the iPhone, the device’s power button sits on the right edge and two volume buttons on the left.. A dual SIM tray offers space for (you guessed it) two nano-SIM cards, or one SIM card and a microSD card up to 256GB to join the device’s 64GB of onboard storage. On the bottom of the phone, you’ll find a speaker grille, a micro USB port and, thankfully, a 3.5mm headphone jack.. At first glance, you might not notice the antenna lines across the R9s’s back. Though the R9s shares the iPhone 6’s antenna placement, its ultra-fine “six-string” antenna layout is almost invisible from certain angles, giving it more of an iPhone 7-like appearance..

I use if on one plus 2 that is not listed, it also work well. Fitbit Community Council members are a select group of volunteers who share support knowledge on the forums and advocate for the betterment of Fitbit products and services. Message 4 of 11. Unfortunately, if it is not a supported device, you may experience this issue quite frequently. Just because a device is not listed doesn't mean it won't work, it just means that Fitbit will not guarantee it will work 100% of the time and that it will work the way it is supposed to work.. Kelly | Oklahoma Alta HR, Blaze, Flex 2, Charge 2, Charge, and Aria * IPhone 7+. Message 5 of 11. Anyway to check if they are working on supporting this phone? I have the same phone and same issue..

No worries I sold oppo away for another phone that works without issue. Fitbit Staff are here to listen and engage with the community on behalf of our larger teams.

It's great to see you here. thanks for the update, I am glad to hear that you will be buying a new phone, you can take a look at our list of compatible mobile devices to see which ones are compatible with our trackers.. about the notifications, as mentioned, your phone needs to be compatible in order to work properly with the Fitbit. You can always try and follow the instructions provided in the My Tracker isn't receiving notifications (Android App). post but I don't guarantee it will work 100%.. Alejandra | Community Moderator, Fitbit. If you like something I recommended, vote for that post and mark it as a solution. Message 11 of 11. Great! Spend hundreds of dollars buying a new phone to get the fitbit to work properly - what a great outcome????. Fitbits' lack of response on the issue of OPPO R9 compatibility is really very poor customer service..

4.4 from 69 reviews. Your trust is our top concern. Companies can't alter or remove reviews from ProductReview.com.au.. 5 out of 5 ,. Super good camera, both front and back. Unfortunately, the screen attracts a lot of dust, because of static. and the screen looks very vibrant for a 1080p display. The Fingerprint scanner works flawlessly and the phone is a pleasure to use.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. I bought this phone about 3 months ago from JB HiFi and really love it since then. After my Samsung Note3 gave up on me, I was looking for a replacement. I no longer wanted to spend top bucks on top of the line after seeing how quickly a top model becomes a mid spec phone in less than a year. I was looking for a 6" phone with 64GB storage and a decent camera around $500 mark. After some research , this OPPO R9S Plus was the only one meet my criteria. The battery last two days with normal use. The inbuilt 64GB storage is huge for my needs. The fingerprint sensor is lightning fast. The low light performance is much better than my daughter's iPhone 7. There are couple of things don't bother me at all but might bother other people:. The interface is more IOS like. I have used iPhone, Windows Phone and Android phones. So this dose not bother me. It might not work for you if you use mobile payment. I always disabled NFC on my previous handsets anyway. Over all, this OPPO R9s Plus is better than either similar priced my wife's Samsung A5 or double priced my daughter's iPhone 7 ,which were all purchased within 6 months, in almost every aspect I value: the screen size, the camera,the storage, the speed, the battery life and value for money..

A very good, cheap phone with pretty good specs and a decent camera that actually ended up surprsing me with it's pictures. Only drawback is that it's will sometimes become slow due to its processor not being able to handle games but it's good for day to day performance. But it's good for it's price. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Excellent phone at a great price.. 4 out of 5 ,. Had this phone for a couple of months now, its been awesome. Great battery life, VOOC fast charge lives up to its expectations, phone build quality is great (looks soo much like an iPhone). Only negatives are that it doesn't have NFC and you cannot change the default messaging app like you could on other Oppo models.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. This phone is worth the price. Its like a Samsung and iPhone in one, since buying it i haven't gone back to either Samsung or iPhone. has great cameras front and back for those who love to take selfies. I highly recommend this phone for people!. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. Love this phone! Wanted a phone with all the fancy features on it, but could not justify paying for an iPhone. Uses a similar interface to Apple, but a fraction of the price. Lightning fast charging, great battery life, easy to use. Planning on buying another OPPO phone next time.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. I have got this phone as a birthday gift from my wife. this was the first time I have used any other brand phones than big brands like apple, samsung and google phones. this phone works well above my expectation. It's icons and home screen looks like I phone home screen. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Oppo R9S Plus - oh so close. 4 out of 5 ,. This is a great value phone. You get a lot of phone for your buck and that cannot be disputed. Aside from the screen size the Plus has 6GB RAM compared to the smaller phones 4GB and a slightly bigger battery. What difference this makes I'm unsure but my review is for the Plus. - camera and other features may not be the top level but are of high standard. - looks like an iPhone so people might think you have an actual iPhone not a Chinger knock off - if that is important to you. - cases etc are hard to come by but I just got mine for $12 on eBay and it suits me fine. - camera ok, not up to iPhone or Samsung standard but ok. - updates and support are uncertain. - native apps are not up to par eg Messaging and Phone apps are sub standard, manageble but not good enough really and they cannot be changed to default to another - they keepp changing back - Oppo did this deliberitely and it is enough for me not to buy another Oppo. All in all a good phone if you dont require the latest and greatist.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. Hesitantly purchase Oppo R9s mobile after my Samsung phone became too slow for me to use. and definitely not regretting the move. The phone is ideal for me. The processing speed cannot be faulted. Got it in a very reasonable mobile phone plan for 24 months. A very good and affordable mobile alternative to high-end mobile.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 3 out of 5 ,. I bought one from Harvey Norman in Gold Coast and the issue I have with it is that it does not always respond when you click on things and when scrolling, other than that for the price its good. So if you are looking for a cheap smartphone it is a good option.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Great camera but OS is a step down from an iPhone. 4 out of 5 ,. Purchased as a replacement for an iPhone because OPPO is way more affordable and has a great camera. I did really miss free iMessage between iPhone users but use FB Messenger more now. Haven't tried dual sim but put an SD card in second slot. 1 No sound for sms and haven't worked out how to fix it! Phone rings though and lots of ringtone. 2 Step counter or pedometer apps don't work because the phone kills all apps in the background. I found only one that would stay on but it drained the battery. 3 Be warned that the "optimize" resets "locked" apps and kills the alarm clock so I slept in until I learnt not to do that!. 4 No forward swipe in internet browsers (might be an Android thing). 6 Selfies flipped (mirror image) unless you figure out how to change the settings. 7 Hard / impossible to get support from the online forum as it's a Chinese phone. 8 Google Play sometimess starts by itself in the car on Bluetooth. 1 Good battery and super fast charge (20mins). 2 Great camera although you need a steady hand. 3 Works with FB Messenger, WhatsApp & instagram. 6 takes micro SD card for extra storage. 7 Bluetooth works in car for calls and audio. 8 Comes with screen protector already stuck on and you get a clear case.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 1 person found this helpful, do you?. 4 out of 5 ,. Build quality is excellent and very much in the spirit of the iPhone 6s. Camera is excellent and takes very decent pics. Finger print reader is the one of the fastest ive ever used. Runs its own version of Android which has an iPhone type experience. If you're looking for an iPhone alternative id highly recommend this phone.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 3 out of 5 ,. It sucks that the phone does not resize photo so you can send them through mms.if you take a photo you have to screen shot it before you can send it as a mms that is the only thing I can fault with my oppo r9s other then that it has been a good phone with its own anti virus system. December 10th 2017 Update: Oppo r9s. Only a few problems with oppo over the Samsung the oppo does not automatically resize photos to send by mms. You can not send videos by mms if you screen shot the photo you have taken with the camera some times it you let you send it by mms that is the only thing I am not happy with.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 1 person found this helpful, do you?. Best phone i have ever had. 5 out of 5 ,. Love the OppoR9s honestly it is better then an iphone or a samsung. So easy to use big screen. Comes with its own case and is dual sim. Runs android softwear but oppi has its own store you can get new themes and stuff from. I will never go back to having an iphone.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. As good as my old Samsung but half the price. Easy to use, great camera takes high quality photos, I can't fault this phone. Service support is very helpful also. Comes with cover and screen protector. Love the fingerprint touch lock and unlock function great security feature. I would highly recommend this phone.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 2 out of 5 ,. I bought R9S with very high hopes, but after six months, it's has become a just a pathetic phone. No "Near Field Communications", NFC ,which really sucks.. Even with huge memory of 6gb it still gets non responsive very often, (even though I keep my phone memory clean of any junk). The best thing about this phone was it's long lasting battery n super quick charging ability, but now it's battery drains very quickly, still better, I would say. Very hard to copy paste a number, if you want dial a number from text msg. I would say it's not a very user friendly phone. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Great phone at half the cost of the big names.. 5 out of 5 ,. As good as a Samsung but at a fraction of the price. Easy to use, great camera, can't fault this phone. Service support is very helpful also. Hard to find accessories, recommend you buy them with the phone. Love the fingerprint touch lock and unlock function.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. Ove owned apple and samsung and love this phone more than any of them. I love that it comes with a screen protector already installed, with is great quality. Very happy with this value for money phone. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 5 out of 5 ,. I have owned Samsungs and Iphones. This phone is the best phone I have purchased. It also is light weight and the battery lasts for a long time compared to my other phones. I can definitely recommend this phone.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. 4 out of 5 ,. It takes a bit of playing around with if you are not tech savvy. Has a good screen but it is a larger mobile so this would be expected. It has been dropped a few times and has not cracked. I have found the internal antenna is not very strong so I sometimes need to position myself differently to pickup our wi fi signal. Value for money wins hands down over more expensive mobile phones on the market.. Similar opinion? Write a review on ProductReview.com.au!. Does the camera hype on this phone live up to its media advertisment or is it just not good?. If you zoom in from a distance, the image results slightly blurry.. The cameras on the phone are very good for the price point. They just lack optical image stabilization. Mariana: Using zoom on most phone cameras results in a blurry image due to it being digital, not optical.. I own an Olympus OMD 10 mk2 camera with many lens and great resolution but since I renewed my phone to the OPPO R9S I am taking most of my shots with it. The results are excellent and any short comings which are fairly minor when they occur I usually can fix with my Photo imaging software without any problems. A guy once said this to me ...."The best camera is the one you have with you at the time". I think the OPPO is a pretty good unit and is with me 24/7 so most shots are done on it unless I have planned for a photo outing which is an infrequent thing for me.. What is the price of this phone?. $40.00/month on Virgins 2GB plan over 24 Months.. I got it for $550 a few weeks ago from officeworks.
