The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. One step closer to the mainstream. This is Oppo's best phone yet and well worth considering if you have a limited budget, but still want something that looks and feels special.. Low price for what you get. Design Premium and super slim metal design Protective case included in box. The Oppo F1 Plus is an expensive-looking smartphone that's actually half the price of the current crop of flagships. If you'd like an iPhone 6S , but your budget won't stretch, this could be a contender.. At a cost of £299 (AU$599, around US$430), you get a lot of phone for your money. A decent battery, a 5.5-inch 1080p display, and an impressive 16MP selfie camera are just the beginning.. There's also a lightning fast fingerprint sensor, a whopping 64GB of internal storage (with microSD support for more), and a sexy, svelte, metallic body, which may leave you wondering where the compromises have been made.. Weight : 145g Dimensions : 151.8 x 74.3 x 6.6 mm OS : Android 5.1 Screen size : 5.5-inch Resolution : 1080 x 1920 CPU : MediaTek Helio P10 RAM : 4GB Storage : 64GB Battery : 2,850mAh Rear camera : 13MP Front camera : 16MP. If you've never heard of Oppo before, suffice to say it's a Chinese manufacturer that has done well at home and in emerging markets.. It has gradually drifted toward the premium end of the budget market and is now looking to tempt Europeans with the best of its line-up.. And the F1 Plus definitely is tempting, but we also have to consider the MediaTek processor, Oppo's Color OS on top of the aging Android 5.1 Lollipop operating system, and the 13MP main camera. There's a whiff of style over substance here.. When you first lay eyes on it, the Oppo F1 Plus looks a lot like an iPhone 6S Plus. It has a curvy metallic body and a comfortable feel.. Flip it over and you'll see a protruding camera lens at the top left and two horizontal bands breaking up the metal body that are there to improve antenna performance and ensure you can get a signal.. The F1 Plus also has exactly the same sized 5.5-inch display with a full HD 1080p resolution, as the iPhone 6S Plus, though Oppo's display is AMOLED. It's bright and vibrant, with good detail, but the colors definitely look oversaturated at times.. Oppo has managed to outdo Apple on the slim stakes; the F1 Plus measures just 6.6mm thick compared to the positively chubby 6S Plus at 7.3mm.. The lozenge design on the home button, which also houses a fingerprint sensor, is more reminiscent of Samsung. You have to actually press it to bring the F1 Plus to life and have it read your fingerprint and unlock, just like the last few Galaxy phones.. It's also on a par with them in terms of performance, only occasionally failing if your finger or thumb is wet or dirty.. Regardless of where the design cues originated, this is a lovely-looking phone and it feels reassuringly solid, though it weighs in at just 145g, which is very light for a handset this big. Consider that the Samsung Galaxy S7 weighs 152g and only has a 5.1-inch display.. There are no surprises in the button placement, with separate volume controls on the left spine and a power button on the right. You'll find the micro USB port and the 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom edge.. The SIM slot is above the power button and it can accommodate either two nanoSIMs or a nanoSIM and a microSD card of up to 128GB in size.. The Oppo F1 Plus feels very comfortable to hold and, if your hands are big enough, it's pretty easy to use one-handed. The matte metallic finish gives way to a gloss, chamfered edge when it meets the display and this actually adds some grip, too.. Oppo also provides a simple, transparent gel case in the box to give it an extra layer of protection.. My F1 Plus review unit is gold, but you can also get it with a rose gold finish.. The Oppo F1 Plus makes a very good first impression and there's no arguing that this is a very polished design for a £300 (AU$599, around $430) phone.. Next Page Key features.

Pop quiz: Which phone company launched big and small versions of its gorgeous, all-metal, flagship smartphone? It’s most likely you’ll say, “Apple,” but in this case, you’d be wrong. We’re talking about Oppo and its flagship twins the F1 and the F1 Plus. Oppo isn’t terribly subtle about the mimicry, either, because its F1 Plus could very well be the doppelganger of Apple’s iPhone 6S Plus .. Although the world really doesn’t need another iPhone imitator, we’re prepared to forgive the F1 Plus its visual sins if the rest of the package is great. We’ve spent some time with the phone, to see if it’s more than just another wannabe iPhone.. What have we got? Slick, curvy sides, a 2.5D sheet of glass over a 5.5-inch display, and a slightly raised camera lens in the top left corner on the back. There’s a fingerprint sensor inside the home button on the front, and a pair of antenna breaks top-and-tail along the smooth, metal rear panel. The F1 Plus is gorgeous, slim, lightweight, and very well made. However, it’s derivative as hell, and that’s going to put people off.. It’s a shame, because it’s a joy to hold. The phone measures 6.6mm thick, weighs146 grams, and the rounded sides sit in your hand comfortably. The sleep/wake key and the volume buttons are perfectly placed for my hand and require almost no readjustment to press them. The perfect button placement is terribly unusual on a phone with a 5.5-inch display. That metal rear panel has a pleasing texture too, and the phone isn’t as slippery as it looks.. Oppo may not be the best-known smartphone brand, but we have absolutely no concerns over build quality or sturdiness. There are no creaks from the body, no flex, and no worrying gaps where parts join together. We’ve used several Oppo phones over the past months, and each has been up to the same high standard. Buy the F1 Plus, and you’ll wonder how such quality is possible for the low price.. Despite the obvious iPhone comparisons in design, this phablet doesn’t come with an Apple price tag. The F1 Plus can be purchased for around 300 British pounds.. What’s the catch? After all, that’s cheap for any good-looking smartphone, regardless of the specifications. Let’s take a look at the inner workings, which is where corners are traditionally cut. The 5.5-inch screen has a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution, which is in-line with the iPhone 6S Plus, the OnePlus 3, and Huawei P9, but less than flagships from LG and Samsung. However, Oppo has chosen a stunning AMOLED panel that looks beautiful, so the screen isn’t the weak link.. Inside, there’s 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage space, a MicroSD card slot, and the option of using the same slot for a second SIM card if you’d prefer. There’s nothing wrong with any of those specs either. If there’s a downside to the phone’s specs, then it may be the MediaTek processor inside, which although reliable, often has problems when playing the latest and most graphically intensive games.. Buy the F1 Plus and you’ll wonder how such quality is possible for the low price.. Running an AnTuTu benchmark test returned a score of 51,710, less than half that achieved by the OnePlus 3, the LG G5, and the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Geekbench 3 gave a 3,333 multi-core score, and 3DMark turned up 342, which hinted the F1 Plus would have the guts for games.. Playing Danmaku Unlimited on Hard mode with the HD graphics was excellent, without any slowdown or touchscreen inaccuracy to hamper progress through the bullet-hell shooter. Crossy Road was similarly excellent. Riptide GP2 suffered more, and the app repeatedly crashed with the graphics and shadow detail maxed out. Mid-level shadows and the graphics at around 80 percent resulted in a frame rate drop and the phone getting warm to the touch.. A Qualcomm Snapdragon chip like the ones found in most Android flagships would undoubtedly improve the F1 Plus’s gaming performance, but overall, the experience is good, which suggests the MediaTek chip has been optimized inside the phone. It’s definitely more than adequate for everyday use and casual gaming.. Oppo F1 Plus Compared To. Oppo’s fingerprint sensor is inside the home button, which actually functions as a button as well just like the one on Apple’s iPhone. It promises to unlock the phone in just 0.2 of a second. While we didn’t time its reaction speed, we can confirm it’s really, really fast. The sensor is also very accurate and steadfastly refused to give a false reading, or require more than a single touch. We love the ability to press the home button and go straight to the home screen from a black lock screen in double fast time. Annoyingly, although there’s a fingerprint sensor, the F1 Plus doesn’t have NFC so can’t be used with Android Pay.. Oppo’s gone contrary with the cameras on the F1 Plus. On the front is a whopping 16-megapixel ISOCELL lens with an f/2.0 aperture, while the rear camera has 13 megapixels and an f/2.2 aperture. That’s right, you’ll take higher resolution pictures with the front cam than the rear. Like the smaller Oppo F1 , the F1 Plus is billed as the narcissist’s dream.. The front camera certainly lets in plenty of light, but oddly the image it produces isn’t that impressive, and selfies appear more washed out than those shot with lesser front cams. There’s an effective beauty mode that compensates for the errors slightly. It uses two adjustable settings to change skin tone and smooth out lines.. Putting it side-by-side with the iPhone 6S Plus in exactly the same environment, the iPhone’s front camera produced a more realistic portrait of my face — but that’s not necessarily what we want from a selfie. The moment I’m capturing doesn’t need to be spoiled by the fact I hadn’t bothered to shave, for example. Oppo’s front cam and the beauty mode made short work of prettying up my face, abandoning realism for wrinkle and blemish-free fantasy.. How does the rear cam perform? Respectably, but little more. The f/2.2 aperture is the problem, it simply doesn’t let enough light in to take brilliant pictures, and those that do look decent still require some editing. It’s possible to improve them with a few tweaks, but not everyone is going to bother. Show it mixed conditions, or overcast days, and noise is introduced in the depths of the image. There’s an HDR mode, but the aperture doesn’t help it balance images out, and still left shots washed out where other sensors would have managed better.. The F1 Plus is a really slim phone, and we all know what that means: A small battery. Sure enough, it’s a 2,850mAh cell inside the phone, and that has to power Oppo’s ColorOS 3.0 user interface placed over the top of Android 5.1. Another hint the MediaTek processor has been treated with respect inside the F1 Plus is the two-day use we’d get from the battery before a recharge was required.. Even better news is the presence of Oppo’s VOOC fast charging system, which is missing from the smaller F1. Provided you use the included charger and Micro USB cable, some clever circuitry keeps the power flowing and the temperatures low, resulting in a more efficient charge. We took the F1 Plus from 2 percent to 100 percent in an hour and 11 minutes. Yes, you’ll still need to find a wall socket, but not for all that long — You can grab a 60 percent charge in just 30 minutes.. Android 5.1 is hidden underneath ColorOS, Oppo’s own interpretation of how Android should look and operate. It’s not drastically different from Google’s vision, and nowhere near as awful as that on the F1. However, there are a few key alterations that Android fans will notice. There’s no app drawer, like many Huawei and ZTE phones, and while the notification drawer still has shortcuts for brightness, Wi-Fi, and other settings, they’re accessed with a left swipe. It doesn’t add anything except another step to the process, and is completely superfluous.. Oppo was sensible and didn’t install much bloatware, but it did add the Opera browser, its own security center, sound recorder, file manager, plus a music and video player. The only exception is WPS Office, but this can be uninstalled.. Oppo loves its gestures, and you can draw shapes on the lock screen to activate certain apps. Tracing a V opens the music player, for example. The most useful of these is a double-tap to wake the lock screen, just like on LG’s smartphones.. There’s no doubt the F1 Plus would be improved by having stock Android, but that’s true of almost every Android phone with a manufacturer’s user interface over the top. However, it’s not the hateful, irritating mess that many may have experienced using the F1. The F1 Plus’ interface is a considerable improvement over the UI running on its little brother. The UI runs fast, smooth, and any alterations aren’t really that intrusive.. That doesn’t excuse Oppo for not updating the F1 Plus with Android 6.0, though, and it’s a black mark against the phone. We’re concerned that if Oppo hasn’t updated the software yet, it likely won’t do so in a timely fashion. That’s bad news in terms of security. The other problem is a bug that stops the Wi-Fi reconnecting with known networks automatically. Wi-Fi will only reconnect when you open the settings app. It’s a very annoying bug, and a potential drain on your data plan.. The Oppo F1 suffered from limited band support, meaning it can connect to 4G LTE networks in Europe or China (where it’s called the R9 Plus), but not in North America. It’s the same problem with the F1 Plus, sadly, as the all-important LTE bands 20, 13, 12, and 25 are missing, meaning it’ll mostly miss out on 4G connectivity across the four major U.S. The warranty period is a single year for the hardware and six months for the battery in the U.K., but doesn’t cover accidental damage, water damage, or anything caused by you taking the device apart.. We really like the Oppo F1 Plus. It’s attractive, powerful, and well built, but there’s a massive problem. No, it’s not the limited LTE band support, although that is a concern in the U.S., or even the iPhone-like style. It’s that the OnePlus 3. has come along and spoiled the party for Oppo and other cutthroat budget phone makers.. SanDisk Ultra 64GB microSDXC UHS-I Card. The OnePlus 3 looks sweeter, has a stronger processor, more RAM, and a better rear camera than the Oppo F1 Plus, but costs only a little more. OnePlus’s OxygenOS Android user interface is more pleasing to use than Oppo’s ColorOS too. If you want a smartphone with panache, power, and a low price, then OnePlus 3 has the F1 Plus beat. However, Oppo’s phone is lighter, more dainty to hold, and has a MicroSD card slot, plus the two phones share similarly fast charging times for the battery.. We get the impression Oppo is still searching for exactly the right formula for its smartphones. It’s so nearly there, and while the F1 Plus is our favorite Oppo device in recent times, the company has yet to give us a breakout, runaway hit that we can truly recommend. It’s a shame it looks like the iPhone, because underneath, there’s a device that deserves recognition for being a great bargain and a stride forward for Oppo.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

Oppo F1 Plus review: iPhone-esque, but Oppo's best yet. Oppo has seen massive growth in the last 12 months, and this is its best phone yet.. Oppo is a name still alien to the smartphone masses in the West, but that hasn't stopped it from working hard in the East. It's been steadily putting out better and better phones in the last year or so, culminating in the F1 Plus —. It looks a bit too much like an iPhone for some tastes, and the software is a big departure from the Android many know and love. But there have been so many steps forward it's hard not to be impressed. If only it wasn't running Lollipop.. Oppo F1 Plus Full review. One of the fastest fingerprint sensors around. Color OS still has some flaws. While Samsung and Apple still account for the largest share of the smartphone market, from there the Chinese brands are starting to make their mark. Some, like Huawei and Xiaomi are well publicized, but Oppo has quietly become a major player.. It's been adopting something of a Huawei approach in recent times. The hardware has been pretty good. Well made, decently designed and for the most part, fairly priced.. Oppo is already making its mark in its native China, but with a big push planned for India in 2016 as well as starting to push for a presence in Europe, it could well become a name we begin to get more familiar with.. The F1 Plus is the latest to bear the badge, and it's the so-called "selfie expert." The 16-megapixel front facing camera is very much the marketing focus. Hopefully there's a good smartphone behind it all, and that's what we're here to find out.. We've been using a Southeast Asia model F1 Plus for the purposes of this review provided by Oppo, on both EE and Vodafone in the UK. There was also a spell where the phone was roaming in China and Hong Kong on local networks.. During the course of the review period of two weeks, the F1 Plus received a software update to build number X9009EX_11_A.13_160413. The software has been Color OS 3.0 throughout, based on Android 5.1 Lollipop.. The phone we've been using (X9009) is in most regards identical to the European spec F1 Plus, with the exception that it doesn't support LTE Band 20. The retail models made for sale in Europe will have this we're informed by Oppo,. Color OS 3.0 based on Android 5.1. Yes VOOC Flash Charge at 4A. 151.8 x 74.3 x 6.6 mm. The F1 Plus follows recent Oppo trends in a sense that it's metal, metal, metal. But while Chinese phones are often criticized for being to Apple-esque, here it's fairly warranted. Whether that's a bad thing or not depends on your personal outlook. Either way, it's a good looking, well put together phone.. It's slim, sleek and yes, looks a bit like an iPhone. The F1 Plus is very slim, and yet doesn't feel awkward to hold as can be the case when things go on too much of a diet. The metal back and sides meet the front of the phone with a chamfer, and creates just enough of a lip not to be too slippery. Oppo includes a TPU case in the box, if that's something you're worried about.. It's fairly well balanced, too, with the almost non-existent side bezels keeping the width of the phone in check while it's quite tall. That's mostly down to the fingerprint sensor, which for the F1 Plus comes around to the front and marks Oppo's first phone with a physical home button.. In the hands-on video above I criticized the fingerprint sensor, as out of the box it just refused to work. After some better time with it that opinion has changed dramatically. This is one of, if not the fastest around. The key is in the setup.. During my first out of the box set up I didn't move my finger around that much. And I noted that it only worked with the finger dead straight. Turns out if you move your finger around and change the orientation to horizontal when you're recording the print, everything works just fine.. Huawei has been the recipient of significant praise for the speed of its fingerprint scanners, but Oppo may have taken the crown. It's definitely faster than the iPhone. You still have to tap the home button to wake the screen, but the scanner is so fast you never see a hint of the lock screen.. Oppo's fingerprint scanner is insanely fast. The display is nice, if unremarkable. Oppo has stuck with full HD at 5.5-inches, and anyone who says that isn't perfectly fine is probably lying. This isn't a top of the line phone, anyway, but even so, it's good. The AMOLED panel is vibrant and still plenty sharp enough to make the pixels disappear. The rest of the F1 Plus bares regular phone parts. You have a charging port down the bottom, microUSB for now, with support for Oppo's own VOOC quick charging. Along the bottom edge you also get the solitary speaker and the 3.5mm headphone jack. Yes, it's on the bottom, where it belongs.. The one design choice I'm not so fond of is splitting the power and volume controls across opposite sides of the phone. It might be muscle memory on my part, but I've turned the display off way too many times when I actually wanted to turn the volume down. The positioning is at least very handy for taking screenshots. Using two fingers with either hand wrapped around the phone you can snap them with ease, which is pretty good for a fairly large phone.. The other thing I really want to point out is the internal storage. The F1 Plus has a microSD card slot, which is great. But what's even better is the 64GB that's built in. More than the LG G5, the Galaxy S7 or the HTC 10. Ultimately what we have in the F1 Plus is a nice looking, well made, slim and light phone with an amazing fingerprint scanner. On the hardware side it ticks most of the boxes, especially if you're looking for a solid mid-ranger. There's lots to like, and nothing that sticks out as being something to dislike.. Remember when we collectively drew a line in the sand about phones launching in 2016 and not running Marshmallow ? The F1 Plus does not run Android Marshmallow, so consider a line drawn.. That's not it, though, review over, because there's a lot to talk about. And believe it or not, a lot of good that Oppo has done with its custom version of our favorite mobile operating system, Color OS.. The first is with the overall performance. Previous versions have been pretty bad in places, with the sort of lag and jerky behavior that you'd have found back in 2011. But with version 3.0, that's all gone. Hello Smooth City, population Oppo F1 Plus.. It could also be the extra hardware found in this phone over previous ones, but whatever it is, it's now a smooth, speedy experience. And one that makes Color OS mostly enjoyable to use.. As with EMUI and MIUI, the appearance of Color OS will split opinions. There's lots of white, lots of color and a whole heap of themes to download and change it even further. There continues to be no app drawer, and that'll either bother you or it won't.. You can't see notifications that have black text. One of the changes over regular Android, and one that takes Color OS down the iOS rabbit hole, is how the stock apps' settings can all be found within the main settings menu on the phone. You might not use any of them, but it's still a little confusing to see. It affects basically everything except the stock browser.. That's probably because the stock browser is Opera. It's not labelled as such, more that it's "powered by Opera" but it's the exact same app you'd get if you downloaded Opera from the Play Store. I like this, partly because I use Opera anyway, but the approach is better than Oppo making its own, sub-par experience. You still get Chrome pre-installed as ever, but for once the stock browser isn't some hideous app you'll never want to touch.. Both looks and how it behaves. It suffers from the Huawei problem of being a dark, translucent background, which means any apps pushing notifications with dark text (like Gmail and Slack) become unreadable.. The bigger issue is that sometimes you just don't get notifications at all or when you do, tapping on them does nothing. I do like the split-screen approach where all the quick settings are together, a swipe over away from a full screen of notifications. But, there are definitely bugs to be worked out.. But issues aside, Color OS 3.0 is a big improvement on what came before it, especially as we wait to see what happens with Project Spectrum. But it's hard to hide our disappointment at Android Lollipop in April 2016. Especially since that excellent fingerprint scanner on the front can't be used with apps that make use of the APIs in Marshmallow.. Oppo F1 Plus Front camera. As it's the main marketing focus for this phone, I'm going to break from the norm and talk about the front facing camera first. It's a whopping 16MP sensor, larger even than the one on the back of the phone. While this just means larger, higher resolution selfies, it's still unusual and impressive.. For the ultimate selfies, you could still argue something like the OIS HTC included in the 10 is more beneficial. Especially holding a phone at arm's length. The F1 Plus does give you screen flash, though, for those darker moments.. Beauty mode just makes you an awful lot smoother. The F1 Plus also includes, the now seemingly standard, beauty and panorama modes, to smooth out your features and add some rosy cheeks or include all your friends in your snapshot. Nothing too fancy, but as with other phones with the so-called beauty mode, your mileage will vary. Some of us just look like much smoother beasts.. The panorama mode is very easy to use, it just takes three images and stitches them together. Take a picture of yourself first, then turn one way, then the other, and get a big happy group selfie to remember your super fun times.. What of the actual pictures? (Since that's what matters the most.) They're very good, but in my experience there's nothing that really wows me. I'm no selfie aficionado, but I don't see anything that really stands out as being groundbreaking. Maybe that's a side product of the marketing hype.. It takes nice-looking shots, but at the edges they can become a little blurry. Sure, the focus is supposed to be your face, but perhaps I expected a little more. And the British filter is misleading. I expected tea and crumpets, or something.. One thing that does frustrate me is that the front camera shoots mirror images, i.e. And there doesn't appear to be an editing tool built in to flip it back around. That might not be a problem for you, but I like things the right way around. At least it is when you shoot video.. Oppo F1 Plus Rear camera. When you're done taking pictures of yourself you can turn things around and use the 13MP rear camera. You get a few added options over the front camera, like HDR and an actual flash, but much is the same.. There are a few additional things you can do with the rear camera. Like the front-facer you can shoot GIF animations and use filters as well as take double exposure shots. But for the back you get an "Expert mode" which lets you fiddle with some manual settings, including the ability to save RAW files.. There's also one labelled "Ultra HD," which isn't what you might think it is, especially since it doesn't relate to video. For all intents and purposes you get the same looking pictures as just snapping in auto, but the picture itself is larger. Useful perhaps if you're going to be cropping in a little.. The camera app is pretty easy to use, everything is well laid out and nothing tries to be too complicated. The F1 Plus is quite fast to focus and shoot, and takes fairly nice looking photos. This sample gallery was taken with everything on default settings.. It leaves something to be desired in lower light situations, but when it's not so dark there's not a lot bad to say. And it does have a tendency to over saturate, most noticeable in my testing when shooting greens.. Oppo F1 Plus Battery life. The battery in the F1 Plus isn't the largest of a phone this size, but the important thing is that it can make it through a day. That seems to be the case, with even the usually taxing roaming not dropping usage below the end of a working day.. The F1 Plus support's Oppo's VOOC fast charging which means that if you are finding yourself short and you can find an outlet, a quick plug in will top you up quite quickly. Sadly since my review unit hasn't come with a UK or even European VOOC adapter, I've not been able to put it to regular test. But using it while in China, it seems to be the real deal.. Oppo showed us its next generation of fast charging at MWC , claiming to be able to go from 0-full in just 15 minutes. While it's not jumping in with a standard like QuickCharge from Qualcomm, it is serious about fast charging.. Where there is a little confusion is in how Oppo handles reporting what's using your battery. It'll give you apps and percentages and what not, but it doesn't seem to just give you a graph and the screen on time like pretty much every other Android phone does.. This will only be an irritation if you're the kind of phone buyer who looks into this stuff and cares about screen on time, but still. It's a little odd that something so simple would be made so much more complicated than it needs to be.. Oppo F1 Plus: The bottom line. Should you buy it? Sure. The F1 Plus is Oppo's best phone yet. While the 'R' series is typically the higher-end offerings, the more mid-range 'F' is currently the one to beat. It's a combination of things, not least that the software is now, well, usable.. That's more important than anything on the hardware sheet. Previous versions of Color OS were not pleasant to use. They were slow and janky and tarnished any kind of positives. But that's all gone away now, and for the better. Even if it does still run on Lollipop.. You may criticize that it looks too much like an iPhone, which it does, but that would be doing it a disservice. It's also a good phone at a great price. It'll cost around £300 in Europe when it goes on sale in May, and you get a lot for that. A pair of good, if not exceptional cameras, fast charging, solid internal hardware and a whopping 64GB of onboard storage with a microSD card slot. Phone's that cost almost twice as much still only have half that amount of storage.. Oppo's tale of recent success has been mostly down to the Asian market. But you can buy this phone without a carrier for £300, and you'll probably be very happy with it.. While we're not definitively saying that this is the phone to buy, especially as the mid-tier, unlocked market is stronger than ever, there's no real reason to say you shouldn't buy it. So long as you're happy with a phone that currently runs Lollipop.. If you like what you see then go for it and be very happy with your choice. Huawei's non-Honor branded phones are plenty more expensive, Xiaomi still doesn't exist in Europe and we've still to see where OnePlus goes this year, likewise with Motorola.. The Oppo F1 Plus is a fine choice in this price range.. The Oppo F1 Plus is due to go on sale in Europe some time in May. It can already be purchased in retail stores in India, as well as at Snapdeal.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

Press enter or click on the search icon. What is the Oppo F1 Plus?. The Oppo F1 Plus is one of the most “normal” phones made by Oppo to date. This is a company that caused some fuss with the release of the Oppo N3 and its rotating camera, so with that in mind, “normal” isn’t meant as a dig.. It’s one of the more impressive phones you’ll find for £300, netting you a truly premium-feeling handset with a decent camera and a screen on which you can easily watch films. However, disappointing gaming performance means it loses out on a full recommendation.. Video: What’s the no.1 phone right now?. The Oppo F1 Plus is a sizeable phone – with its 5.5-inch screen, it was never going to be small.. Elegant, high-class design stop this from being an issue – unless you don’t want a handset of generous proportions, that is. Taking a few design notes from recent iPhones, the Oppo F1 Plus sports an aluminium shell, a one-piece housing that curves around at the sides and is bevelled where it meets the glass of the screen.. Its design isn’t original but it’s attractive nonetheless, and there’s barely any redundant space to the left and right of the display. Unlike the Oppo F1 I reviewed recently, there’s no plastic on show aside from the thin strips on the back that are used to let the wireless antennas breathe.. Like its cheaper sibling, there’s a hint of gold to the finish – but it’s of a tone that almost anyone should be able to swallow. This is not smartphone design via Moschino. The Oppo F1 Plus is remarkably simple and clean.. It’s also one of the first Oppo phones I’ve used to have a fingerprint scanner. As with this handsets overall design, it isn’t out to make waves; it sits in the same “central soft key” position favoured by the likes of Samsung and Apple. It rest on top of a clicky button rather than a static pad, and its response is near-instant.. Like other handsets with fingerprint scanners, its main purpose is as a means to unlock the F1 Plus.. The Oppo F1 Plus is supplied with 64GB, so few people will need to worry about getting a microSD card. For a £299 phone, this is a major bonus. The Oppo F1 Plus’ slick design may give it mainstream appeal, but Oppo hasn’t forgotten its original geeky following. A SIM tray holds the usual SIM slot and a second slot that can be used to hold either a second SIM or memory card.. The Oppo F1 Plus isn’t cheap, but you do get plenty such hardware extras for the money.. Oppo hasn’t piled its budget into conspicuous spec upgrades, however. The Oppo F1 Plus has a large 5.5-inch display, but its resolution is a conservative 1080p. You’ll notice when viewing the screen from around 15cm away, but this remains a sharp display..

Outdoors visibility is a notch below the best, and while the screen is capable of going bright enough to make the display pretty clear, it’s only with the Auto brightness mode is maxed out.. As I found with the Oppo F1, the Auto brightness algorithm needs work. It’s only an issue outdoors on those sunny days, though. In less challenging conditions it’s perfectly fine.. Colours are a little more saturated and lively than the sRGB standard, but I get the sense that – like headphones with extra bass – Oppo is responding to what the public wants. I’d appreciate some screen controls for temperature or saturation, however; there’s no such control on offer in the Oppo F1 Plus.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

Roydon Cerejo , 04 April 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Oppo recently created a new category within its smartphone lineup, called the F-series, with its central focus being camera quality. The Oppo F1 ( Review ) was the first model to kick-start this series back in January and today the company has launched the F1 Plus, which was teased a few months back.. As it turns out, the F1 Plus is the same as the Oppo R9 , just rebadged for our market. The latter was announced last month alongside another variant called the R9 Plus for the Chinese market. The F1 Plus is also billed as a "Selfie Expert" smartphone owing to its high-resolution front camera. However, this is not merely an Oppo F1 with a better camera and bigger screen - the company has added many more creature comforts that were missing in the debut model, which makes this an interesting product on its own.. Look and feel There's no getting around the fact that the design of the F1 Plus has been heavily "inspired" by the current iPhone design. It's not the first time companies have drawn inspiration from popular smartphones and it certainly won't be the last. Oppo seems to have made efforts to ensure that the F1 Plus is not a direct ripoff, and the end result is quite satisfying.. The phone feels incredibly premium in your hands thanks to the metal chassis and the rounded glass edges in the front. It very light too at 145g and is surprisingly comfortable to use with one hand thanks to very narrow bezels on either side of the screen. The display is a 5.5-inch full-HD Amoled panel which produces vivid colours and good levels of brightness. You even get Gorilla Glass 4 for protection. We noticed that the top half of the screen takes on a light blue hue when you tilt it forward, which is most noticeable on white backgrounds like web pages. At first we thought it was due to the screen guard that comes pre-installed but it is in fact the display.. We have backlit capacitive buttons beside the home button, which has an integrated fingerprint sensor. The sensor works extremely well and is easily one of the fastest we've used. It manages to register your fingerprint just before you release the button, making it nearly instantaneous. You also get a white notification LED on the top.. The volume and power buttons are placed on either side of the phone and are comfortable to reach. We would have liked a bit more spacing between the volume buttons but as far as tactile feedback goes, we didn't face any issues. The hybrid SIM tray is on the right, and can accommodate either two Nano-SIMs or a single SIM and a microSD card (up to 128GB).. The back of the phone has a very nice texture that's smooth to touch but can get a bit slippery. We have a very familiar camera bump for the 13-megapxiel sensor, and an LED flash below it. The speaker grille, Micro-USB port and headphones socket are all on the bottom.. We love the attention to detail in the design of the F1 Plus, right from the chamfered edges to the metal ring around the home button. It looks and feels a lot more premium than the F1, and is slimmer too at just 6.6mm. The phone comes nicely packaged, and you get a cable, charger, headset, manuals, soft plastic case, and a SIM ejector tool in the box.. Specifications and software The F1 Plus is powered by MediaTek's MT6755 octa-core SoC, which is also known as the Helio P10. It's a 64-bit chip built on the slightly older 28nm fabrication process and packs in a Mali T860 GPU. Coupled with 4GB of RAM, the overall performance is quite a bit faster than say, a Snapdragon 616. In AnTuTu, we got a score of 51,022 points while GFXbench returned 16fps in the T-Rex test.. The phone also has 64GB of storage, Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, Wi-Fi Direct, Miracast, and USB OTG. NFC and FM radio are two features that are sorely missed. Also, it wouldn't have hurt to throw in support for Wi-Fi ac too. The F1 Plus supports 4G for Indian bands and VoLTE.. Colour OS has a slick new look in v3.0 when compared to previous Oppo smartphones, and no prizes for guessing what inspired it. We have a new set of icons, some of which are straight out of iOS. Hitting the Recents capacitive button lines up all your apps as cards, which you can slide sideways to flip through, or flick upwards to close. The notifications shade is split into two tabs; one for notifications and the other for all your toggle switches.. It's a single-layered interface and you can add widgets and change the animations by pinching the home screen. The F1 Plus runs Android 5.1 Lollipop which works just like it should. Marshmallow would have been nice to have out-of-the-box, and we hope that Oppo will release an update soon.. Jumping into the Settings app, we have the usual options along with toggles for gesture-based actions. You also get O-Cloud integration for backing up messages and data to the cloud. Just like iOS, additional settings for apps like the camera, photos or contacts are now placed in the main Settings app rather than within each respective app.. Oppo preinstalls Google's suite of apps, a file manager, a weather app, Kingsoft Office, and Security Center. Theme Store gives you access to a good selection of wallpapers and themes, which are free to download. The stock browser has Opera Max's data saving feature, which can be toggled in case you're running low on your monthly data plan.. Performance The F1 Plus runs very smoothly for everyday use and you'll usually have about 2GB of RAM free for apps. We didn't face any noticeable lag during our time with the phone. The fingerprint sensor is blazing fast and almost never skipped a beat. We did find the ambient light sensor to be a bit slow to react to changing light. 4G works on both SIM slots and a new SIM is registered quickly without the need for a reboot. Call quality is good too, and the speaker is fairly loud for conference calls.. The phone does a good job of handling media files. The music player get a sound enhancement called Dirac Power Sound for the speaker and headphones. We were impressed with the volume level from the mono speaker, which is sufficiently loud without sounding tinny and hollow. The video player didn't support some of the codecs in our test files but it did handle high bit-rate videos pretty well. The bundled headset offers good audio quality for calls but didn't sit very comfortably in our ears. Our 4K test files struggled to play smoothly.. The F1 Plus prides itself as a selfie phone and for that, Oppo has fitted it with a whopping 16-megapixel, fixed-focus front camera with a decently wide f/2.0 aperture. Selfies taken under natural light are sharp with very good detail. Picture quality starts dipping under artificial lighting and sharpness dips further at night. Screen flash and palm gesture features are also present, just like on the Oppo F1. A dedicated flash is something that's missing, and the screen flash is a bit too weak to give you sharp images in low-light scenarios.. Around the back, we have a 13-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture which manages to capture some pretty detailed landscaped and macros. It also performs decently in low light although the level of detail takes a hit, and noise is visible when you zoom in. The quality of recorded video is also good during daytime, but it gets quite grainy in low light. The maximum supported resolution is 1080p.. The camera app has been redesigned to be used in portrait mode rather than landscape. You can swipe left or right to switch between basic shooting modes, and even more modes can be accessed through an icon next to the shutter button. There are fewer modes in this version of Colour OS, however all the important ones are still present, such as Expert mode which now lets you toggle saving in RAW. We found the Panorama mode to be a little unpolished since it only works with the phone held in portrait mode, and only moving from left to right. The new app looks nice but still needs a lot of polish.. Battery life The F1 Plus packs in a 2850mAh battery which lasted for 13 hours and 3 minutes in our video loop test. Under regular use, we had no trouble going beyond a day with 4G. The phone also supports Oppo's VOOC fast charging system, which managed to juice the battery up to 56 percent in just half an hour. One thing to keep in mind is that along with the special charger, you need to carry the specific USB cable that ships with the phone. A standard Micro-USB cable will not work for fast charging.. Verdict Oppo has created yet another good-looking smartphone with the F1 Plus. Yes, the new hardware and software look very much like Apple's iPhone and iOS, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. There are people out there who would love to own an iPhone but don't have the means to do so, and it's smartphones like this that help fill the void. 26,990 the F1 Plus is certainly a lot more affordable than an iPhone 6 as well.. That resemblance aside, the F1 Plus is beautifully crafted and extremely well built. It's slim and light weight, has a super-fast fingerprint sensor, vibrant display, good battery life and two very good cameras for daylight photography. Like any tech product however, there's always room for improvement. For instance, the screen's viewing angles aren't the best, and it takes on a bluish tinge if you veer too far from the sweet spot. We would also have liked better connectivity features too such as NFC and Wi-Fi ac. Also, despite the large 16-megapixel selfie camera, it doesn't fare terribly well in low-light situations. The screen flash is nice touch but it's no substitute for an LED flash, especially if you're taking a group selfie.. Overall, the F1 Plus is good smartphone that would be even better at a lower price considering its limitations..

Oppo’s F1 Plus wants to be generation selfie’s dream phone, has a 16-megapixel front cam. Smartphone brand Oppo has launched the R9 and R9 Plus. in China, and the F1 Plus internationally. phones embrace the cult of the selfie even further than existing Oppo devices, by putting a giant 16-megapixel ISOCELL camera, custom made by Samsung, above the screen. The rear camera? That’s only got 13-megapixels. Oppo’s really targeting generation selfie with the R9.. While the R9 and R9 Plus are for China, the F1 Plus will be released in Europe, the U.K., India, and other countries around the world. Despite the name, it’s the equivalent of the R9, so it has a 5.5-inch screen, the MediaTek Helio P10 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage space. are all the same, plus the Android operating system has Oppo’s ColorOS 3.0. When the R9 launched, and we were told by Oppo that it would be sold internationally under a different name, we wondered if it would be. It fits with the brand, as the smaller F1 has an outstanding selfie camera already.. Set for release in May through Amazon in the U.K. and Europe, it’s priced at £300 and 390 euros respectively. Oppo calls the camera the Hi-Light, and here are some more specs. It has an f/2.0 aperture for brighter shots, and a 120-degree wide-angle lens, that in conjunction with Oppo’s Selfie Panorama mode will get your friends into the picture as well. The software also has an updated version of Oppo’s effective Beautify mode, which has been worked on for six months, ensuring it makes you look your best. The result of all this tech is pictures with four times less noise, twice the dynamic range, and improved low-light and nighttime photography over those without the special Hi-Light cam.. The phone around the high-spec selfie cam has definitely been inspired by the iPhone 6S Plus. The curved body, defined horizontal antenna breaks, top left-mounted camera lens, and familiar gold hue gives the R9 and F1 Plus an unmistakably iPhone-esque style. It’s very thin at 6.6mm, light at 145 grams, and should feel great in the hand if previous Oppo phones are anything to go by. Around the front is a 5.5-inch AMOLED screen with 1.6mm bezels, and a 1080p resolution. Underneath is Oppo’s first front fingerprint sensor, built into the home button, that will operate with dry and damp fingers.. Oppo’s chosen the MediaTek Helio P10 processor with 4GB of RAM to power the R9 and F1 Plus, and installed Android with its own ColorOS 3.0 interface over the top. The phone has 4G LTE connectivity, a versatile SIM tray that will take a second SIM or a MicroSD card to increase the 64GB of internal storage space. Finally, Oppo’s low-voltage VOOC fast charging is onboard, providing two hours of talk time after five minutes of charging, but the 2850mAh battery sounds a little smaller than we’d hoped.. The R9 Plus is a larger than the R9. It has a 6-inch AMOLED screen, and swaps the processor for Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 652, upgrades the rear camera to 16-megapixels, and increases the battery size to 4120mAh.. Both the R9 and R9 Plus phones are only sold in China, where prices start at 2799 yuan, or around $430.. We’ll bring you a review of the F1 Plus very soon, so check back in the near future for more on Oppo’s latest phone.. Here’s everything we know about Hideo Kojima’s mysterious….

News Oppo F1 Plus vs Apple iPhone 6s Plus: Design comparison. Oppo F1 Plus vs Apple iPhone 6s Plus: Design comparison. OPPO's new F1 Plus looks similar to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus. We put them through a design comparison to see just how similar they look.. Updated: April 15, 2016 5:27 PM IST. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and seems like OPPO’s designers have taken that to the heart. When OPPO launched the F1 Plus in India earlier this month, many remarked just how similar it looked to the iPhone 6s Plus. To see just how similar the two devices looked, we put them under the lens in our design comparison.. At first glance you will be hard pressed to tell the two devices apart. There is hardly any difference up front with the display turned off, and only the shape of the home button/fingerprint scanner tells which one is the iPhone and which is the Android device. But look closely and you will see the subtle differences.. With dimensions of 151.8×74.3×6.6mm, the F1 Plus is smaller and slimmer than the iPhone 6s Plus (158.2×77.9×7.3mm). The bezels on OPPO’s phone is also extremely thin. Up top, the placement of the selfie camera and the ambient and proximity sensor too differs. Both devices have a physical button surrounded by a metal ring, and an embedded fingerprint sensor. But where one is shaped like a pill, the other is circular.. The similarities are at the back as well, and if you were to hide the logos, it would make it difficult for a layman to tell the iPhone apart from the OPPO. That said, the differences at the back are much easier to detect. Both devices have a protruding camera at the top-left corner, plastic antenna bands, and the logo at the center.. The plastic bands on the iPhone though are much broader, and the LED flash is placed adjacent to the camera. There is a mic on the right of the camera. On the F1 Plus, the flash is placed below the camera lens, and the mic has been pushed to the top of the phone, leaving the back panel Spartan.. The similarities are again carried over to the sides and the bottom of the phones as well. Both devices have the power button and the SIM card tray on the right edge, and while both look similar the placement is different. On the left edge, the iPhone 6s has the volume rocker and the slider button, while the OPPO smartphone only has the volume rocker. At the bottom, both devices have the same combination of speaker grille, charging port, 3.5mm audio jack and a mic. In fact, both even have two screws on either side of the charging port.. There’s little differentiating the OPPO F1 Plus from the Apple iPhone 6s Plus on the design front, and one is clearly a carbon copy of the other (we are looking at you OPPO). Though we don’t mind companies taking inspiration from each other from time to time, there is a limit to how much you can borrow. We wonder what Apple feels about this.. That said, another way of looking at it is that you can own a device that looks and feels as good as the iPhone at nearly half the price. Which camp do you fall in?

Oppo , the second-largest smartphones manufacturer in China, announced the Oppo F1 as the first selfie-centric smartphone. The company is now trying to capitalise on the same concept with the new Oppo F1 Plus; offering a larger screen size and a bezel-less design.. Oppo F1 Plus is the second camera-centric smartphone in Oppo’s F series. The F1 Plus houses a 16 megapixel front camera, and 13 megapixel rear camera. So the phone is clearly aimed at the youth who want a great selfie camera. But does Oppo F1 Plus live up to its hype of being a ‘selfie-expert’? Does the smartphone deliver on other aspects as well? We find out in our review.. Specs: 5.5-inch full HD display | 2GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 (MT6755) | 4GB RAM | 64GB internal storage | 16-megapixel front camera + 13-megapixel rear camera | 2,850 mAh battery | Android Lollipop 5.1. Watch: Oppo F1 Plus Video Review. There are quite a few things that impressed me about the Oppo F1 Plus. First up, the Oppo F1 Plus has a great design and is super light-weight. Plus a crisp display, which makes for great viewing angles. Oppo F1 Plus features a design, quite similar to iPhone 6 series. The gold colour variant that we got for review looks pinkish gold, though not really rose gold in the true sense.. Oppo F1 Plus first impressions: This one is all about great selfies. The smartphone is super thin at just 6.6 mm, and is surprisingly light weight too. The F1 Plus has metal unibody design and comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 on the front for extra protection. The camera unit and flash are placed on the top right corner at the back of the phone, which looks very neat. The smartphone is sleek with round edges, and a thin silver metal frame running along it.. For a person like me, who loves smartphones with large display, this one scores an eight out of ten. The 5.5-inch full HD display is a delight to look at, play games and even use in bright sunlight. Also, F1 Plus has got very thin bezels on the sides, which makes for a wider display.. The home button doubles as a fingerprint scanner, and is one of the fastest I have used. It’s pretty accurate too, and unlocks the phone almost instantly.. But the USP of this phone is undoubtedly the 16MP front camera. Oppo calls this the ‘selfie expert’, and we have to agree. The front camera is one of the best on any Android phone.. This one can click detailed pictures and reproduce great colours. As we pointed out in our first impressions of Oppo F1 Plus can definitely handle reds well. The results in bright outdoors are pretty good. Pictures, however, tend to get a little grainy in low light, though better than some of the other cameras.. Also, the front camera comes with a number of tweaks, which will make you want to go on a selfie spree. I had a great time using various filters and patterns, while shooting numerous selfies with my friends.. Oppo F1 Plus houses a 13 megapixel rear camera with LED flash. The rear camera was not a disappointment either, and gave pretty good shots, especially while clicking in places with ample light. Again, the reds do not bleed and you will end up capturing decent pictures using the same.. Oppo F1 Plus is powered by a 2.0 GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 (MT6755) coupled with 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage. And believe me, this smartphone can handle multi-tasking very smoothly. While playing games is a delight because of the large and vivid display, F1 Plus is equally good when it comes to performance. I watched a couple of videos back to back, played games and used it for multi-tasking without any lags or crashes.. Oppo F1 Plus manages to remain cool most of the times, except when playing graphics-heavy games on it. The smartphone tends to get a little warm within the first few minutes, at the top half, but not annoyingly hot, like most other metal phones.. Oppo F1 Plus packs a decent 2,850 mAh battery, which will easily last for a day from moderate to heavy usage. Plus, it comes with VOOC flash charge, that helps you get over 50 per cent in 35 minutes, which is great.. Design is one of the best things about Oppo F1 Plus, but the build quality left us a little disappointed. Just within a few days of use, the phone’s back got dirty with marks and I couldn’t wipe them off. Also, the smartphone feels really delicate and slippery. F1 Plus needs to be handled carefully, or it might just fall out of your hand, while taking it out of the pocket.. Remember, the Oppo runs the Color OS 3.0 on top of Android Lollipop 5.1 and it should be getting a Marshmallow update for the F1 Plus soon. For those who haven’t used an Oppo phone before, Color OS might seem to be a bit of a change. For me, swiping right for notification settings, while they could very well be placed on top of notifications didn’t quite work.. The Oppo F1 Plus comes with a great design, a decent battery and an amazing selfie camera. I would strictly recommend this one to everyone who likes to post a new selfie every hour on social media, and wants a great camera and a stylish smartphone for the same.. As far as other specs go, several other smartphones at lower prices offer the same package, but compromise on the camera front a bit. Xiaomi Mi 5 at Rs 24,999 is a great option right now, which features a great design and performs pretty well.. Oppo F1 Plus has a 16 mp front camera that rocks.
