Huawei Y5 (2017): Full, in depth review. Huawei Y5 (2017): Full, in depth review. 81 Users want this. 2.00 / 5. Camera is feature rich and decent for the price. The Y5 is Huawei’s cheapest smartphone of the year, and it’s got the look, feel and performance to match that mantle.. While the steady encroachment of fresh Chinese brands like Huawei and more-recently OnePlus into the territory usually reserved for Apple and Samsung has been fascinating to watch unfold, it’s been equally tantalising to watch these brands shake up the budget space.. Here: the lower the asking price, the more valuable even the basic box-ticking features become. Of course, cut too many corners - or make one too many compromises - and you could sour customers on your brand for years to come. Unsurprisingly, lots of customers like the idea of saving money on buying a new phone but very few are excited about paying the price in performance that can come with it.. It’s into this space that Huawei has their launched their latest bid for the attention of the budget-conscious with the 2017 versions of the Huawei Y5 and Huawei Y7 smartphones. Here’s what we made of the former:. Priced at an RRP of $199, the Huawei Y5 is pretty much the lowest price-point Huawei have on offer within Australia.

Let’s see the Huawei Y5 – 2017 Review in detail.. Huawei Y5(2017) is 5.0 inches device with super touch screen that supports the resolutions of 1280 x 720 pixels. It is 4G supported device furthermore the system has Quad-core 1.4 GHz processor. ROM is 16GB and RAM is 2GB while powerhouse has 3000 mAh removable battery.

Huawei Y5 features a 5.0 inches IPS LCD screen and comes with the dimensions of 143.8 x 72 x 8.4 mm with 66% approx. Whereas the device weighs around 150 grams- a light weight device comparatively.. Talking about the front design of Huawei Y5, we have of course an ear piece in the center. To the left side, there’s a front camera and that’s it.The front side is all covered with silver layers on all four edges.. On the right edge, the device has a volume and power buttons where as left edge has also one button. Down side has micro-usb connector and speakers whereas top side has audio jack of 3.5 mm on it.. Back Body is totally simple and plain, it has just back camera lens of 8MP on it with LED flash light. Rest of the body has only Huawei name on it otherwise it is totally simple.. With all other great features, Huawei Y5 gives us an 8MP back camera. This 8 MP camera also features a LED flash light. The camera is however satisfactory, but it captures great pictures in low light. The camera can flexibly adjust itself to capture photos at night and produces stunning pictures.. It can record videos in 1080 pixels quality. Additionally, the camera comes with some built in modes like HDR and panorama etc.. Talking about the front camera it has a 5 MP result and captures amazing images in low light as well as high light. It automatically detects your face and adjusts itself accordingly. You can take benefit of this amazing camera and talk to your loved ones on Skype or take selfies anytime, anywhere you want.. Moreover, you can further beautify your pictures with the help of the face beauty feature. Let’s check out some pictures taken from front camera of Huawei Y5 – 2017.. As far as the memory is concerned, Huawei Y5 comes with a 16 GB ROM and a 2 GB RAM. Giving a benefit to the users as they can easily take as many pictures as they want and store a lot of data.. However, excessive storage of data will exhaust the space up. But for that, the expandable memory option is there which can be expanded up to 128 GB. So if you are a person who loves downloading videos or playing games you can take advantage from the expandable memory with the help of the SD card.. Huawei Y5 is a 3G/4G supportive device so you can enjoy a faster internet speed. It also has other connectivity options like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB.. It also supports some other connectivity’s such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and FM Radio. Wi-Fi supports the standards of b/g/n while Bluetooth version is 4.0.. Y5 is dual SIM supportive smart phone with dual standby function while place of memory card is separate from both SIM places. We can expand its internal memory up to 128GB with the access of memory card.. Huawei Y5 best point is its big and removable Li-ion big battery of 3000 mAh which is present inside the removable back cover. It has 2A charger with it which will completely charge the device in almost one and half hour.. Battery will easily provide us the standby time of 8-9 hours consecutively. Excessive usage of 4G/3G/2G or game play will reduce the battery quickly otherwise it can provide you better time for normal usage.It has media tek chip set which also works for battery saving function.. The Huawei Y5 runs android version 6.0 (Marshmallow) with the interface of. It should have latest android version 7.0 (nougat) and up til now we have not received any update regarding nougat version. Still its interface is one of the best and organized interfaces as compare to Infinix and QMobile devices.. The main screen has date and time widget at its top while below to it we have Google search bar. After it some applications are arranged in the form of rows and columns. It doesn’t have any application manager separate just a slider bar is available to acess all the applications.. Many bloatware applications are already installed on it such as files, phone manager, mirror etc. Themes application is also available via which we can change the color and display of Huawei Y5.. Huawei Y5 has a 1.4 GHz Quad-core processor and contains a chipset of Media Tek MT6737T. This chipset is based on the architecture of ARM Cortex-A53. Furthermore, it has a 2 GB RAM which might make it a little hard to perform multitasking. While doing so, the phone might get stuck.. Antutu comprehensively tests all aspects of a device, including UX, GPU, RAM, CPU, I/O and more. Each item is individually assessed and given a score. Therefore, we ran a test in Huawei Y5 and got to the results where the device scored 40040 points. On its multi-touch test, the device scored 5 points.. In our Vellamo Benchmarking, where three tests were carried out, the device scored 1490 points in multicore test, 1034 in metal test and 1615 in chrome browser test.. In my opinion Huawei Y5 is just another smartphone with the same features and specifications. There is nothing really outstanding about this phone which we think will make this phone a successful one in the market. Especially the fact that there are already a lot of smartphones out there which will give it a tough competition. There was a severe need of some new and unique features to be brought up by Huawei..

Huawei Y5 2017: Design and Hardware. Huawei Y5 2017: Connectivity, Memory and Battery. This app acts as a central monitor for your phone. It gives you an overview of the security status, storage usage, and functions to clean up your phone. The Y5 2017 comes bundled with a Files app for you to easily browse through your internal storage. It sorts data into categories for easier view-ability while also giving you the classic method of browsing folders. Huawei Tools App Bundle: On your Huawei Y5 2017, you would find a tools folder which includes some very useful apps. These apps include the compass, weather, calculator, notes, HiCare etc. All of these apps have been designed in cordination with EMUI and they fit seamlessly. This is one of the highlight features of the Huawei Y5 2017. The extra key on the left side of the phone can be easily modified to perform a certain action or open an app. You can access it through the Settings app. This review of Huawei Y5 2017 was originally published on. Huawei Y5 2017 is the latest offering from the manufacturer under its budget-phones category. This brand has always been the go-to brand in the budget class and we find out if that still stands true with the new Huawei Y5 (2017) smartphone. For starters, Huawei announced the Y5 (2017) just recently at a very competitive price of RS.15,999. This puts the phone directly in competition with budget smartphones. The phone comes in a single storage variant, that is 16GB. For expand-ability, it comes with a dedicated microSD card slot.. As we posted the unboxing experience of Huawei Y5 2017, it is evident from the box that the key feature is 4G capability. Many users think that 4G has become a standard on all phones but that isn’t the case. Most budget phones from small companies do skip on this functionality to keep the price down but Huawei thinks offering high speed data connection will help them sell the new Y5 2017.. You can read the technical specifications of the phone right below.. Right as you hold the Y5 2017, you would feel the plastic back cover, reminiscent. of old days where glass and metal was a fantasy. The plastic, however, serves a good function, it helps make the back removable. However, then again, you find out that the battery is not user replaceable rather you would need a set of tools to get to it. This kind of defeats the purpose of having a removable back and leads us to believe that this decision was made for cost savings. cover almost extends to the front, there is no space for a rim. However, there is a sleek silver line bordering the phone which tries to replicate metal.. The screen forms the major part of the front side. It is a 5.0 inch panel with minimal borders on the side. As our unit was white, we could see the black panel gap found in the display however, in the black variant, this might not be just as visible. The resolution is 720p and that is what we expect for the price. The only gripe was the sharpness as it felt a little less. On the colors end, it felt good. Rest, you would find the Huawei logo at the bottom and your normal array of sensors on top of the screen. There is an extra addition of flash light for the front camera.. Moving on to the right side of the phone, here is where you would find your power and volume buttons. The power button is placed near the thumb and the volume buttons fall on top. This arrangement was easy to get use to.. On the left side, there is a surprise button. This is called the Easy Key. I think this is a very good feature. Similar to old BlackBerry phones, this key is left for the user’s discretion. You can either set it to perform certain actions on a single press, double press or hold or set it to open an app. For the purposes of this review, I set the Easy key to take a screenshot when I single pressed it. It performed quite well and the ease of use was amazing. No extra menus or options, all worked great.. On the top side of the phone, you would find the headphone jack. Which, in these days, is regaining its place towards becoming a feature rather than being a standard. The bottom half houses the single speaker and microUSB. There are two cut outs on the bottom which might lead you to believe that there are two speakers. but one is dedicated to the microphone.. As mentioned earlier, the back cover is plastic and wraps all over the phone. So much that the buttons are housed in the plastic shelf as well. It comes off to help you access the dual SIM slots and the microSD card slot. We expected a removable battery but that isn’t so and we think this defeats the purpose of having a plastic shell in the first place.. Camera, something that not many similar priced smartphones shine in, isn’t anything to write home about in the new Y5 2017. It is a 8.0MP shooter with a f/2.0 aperture. It lacks sharpness, colors aren’t as accurate. What we take away from this is, the module on the Y5 2017 isn’t going to top charts or rock instagram but then again it isn’t supposed to. Camera modules are expensive and users know that. If you are into photography, you wont be relying on your Y5 2017. And for the average user, the output of the smartphone is just enough.. The front shooter is a 5MP shooter with an added LED flash. For video calls, it is quite enough. In terms of front cameras, this one falls in the good category when compared with the competition. The camera app comes with some extra modes that help even further refine the photo. Lowlight conditions do result in a lot of noise hence, the addition of the LED flash. I didn’t find it that much useful but for others it might be different. Also, I think there might be some research demographic that is saying yes to this feature as we see it again and again on only budget phones and not the flagships.. Here are some sample shots from the main camera of the Huawei Y5 2017:. Y5 2017 is a dual SIM smartphone which supports 4G LTE on one slot. For developing markets like Pakistan, users usually have multiple SIMs. One serves as a data SIM for internet while other is dedicated for calls and messaging. This gives the Y5 2017 a good advantage. Furthermore, speaking for the internal storage, the phone comes in one variant that is 16GB storage and 2GB RAM. The RAM is ample but internal storage might raise some eyebrows. However, the Y5 2017 covers it up with an expandable microSD card slot.. The battery capacity is rated at 3,000mAh which translates to a day’s worth of heavy usage. Huawei should have extended the battery capacity as we have even seen 4,100mAh battery fitted in a smaller phone. The Mediatek MT6737T processor is efficient enough that it makes the best out of the battery and provides performance. On benchmarks, it doesn’t show as much but it handles apps well and can keep up with multitasking.. The software is the key distinction with budget phones coming from brands like Huawei who have years of experience developing their Android skin. The Huawei Y5 2017 ships with Android 6.0 Marshmallow and EMUI 4 (Emotion UI). Yes, the phone ships with the older generation of Android. As Android O is just round the corner, once it gets released, this phone will be two iterations backward. This is probably the only issue I have with Huawei on the software department of this phone.. Taking a look at EMUI, you would see it is quite refined and ships with no bloat. There were two extra apps that were sorted away in a separate folder. EMUI quits the App Drawer and puts all the apps on your home screen. Also, I had my device set up with 5×5 grid which gave me a lot more icons on a single screen and made the phone seem bigger in size than it actually was.. EMUI is focused around user customization. You can download themes and apply them, modify the on-screen buttons and their orientation, and more. Also, small additions such as the double tap to unlock the phone work well as the phone doesn’t ship with a fingerprint sensor.. Lastly, the selection of Huawei stock apps is quite large. It comes with all the necessary apps to have your phone running and more. The extra apps include Huawei HiCare, Mirror app, Compass etc. All of these are sorted in a folder, out of your way but you have access to them once you feel the need..

Huawei Y5 2017 What’s it good at?. Huawei Y5 2017 How’s the camera?. Huawei Y5 2017 What’s it not so good at?. Huawei Y5 2017 Should you buy one?. We are giving up the very low-end devices because the margin in this is extremely low, and it’s not making enough profit for us. Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group. For a company that has made it’s name on low end and mid-range devices it is a strange decision but the figures must speak for themselves. Huawei have made some great mid-range and low end phones over the past few years but with that set to end soon we may be looking at one of the last low-end phones from Huawei; the Y5 2017.. The Y5 2017 is most definitely a low-end phone coming in at a sub-$200 price. Huawei have made a habit of packing in some impressive specs and features into lower end phones in recent years. Read on to see how they fared with the Y5 2017.. The packaging of the Huawei Y5 2017 (henceforth to be known as the Y5), comes in a fairly plain box which is reminiscent of the GR5 2017 box from earlier this year. The phone itself is most definitely marketed at the low end range of the smartphone market so nothing fancy should be expected.. The box includes the standard charger, microUSB cable, earphones and of course the phone. Nothing special but for a sub-$200 phone it is important that the buyer knows that they are still getting all the standard inclusions and nothing is left out.. As with so many low-end phones the processor included is a Mediatek processor, the Mediatek MT6737T Quad-core 1.4GHz processor. The processor is a cheap low end processor as is expected but seems to function well enough without breaking any records.. The Mediatek processor is paired with 2GB of RAM, really the minimum an Android phone should have in 2017. The phone is really the minimum of everything that is and should be included in a smartphone in 2017. There is just 16GB of onboard storage which fortunately can be expanded using the microSD slot with cards up to 128GB in size.. The front camera is a decent 5MP shooter and the main/rear camera is an average 8MP camera. It just takes photos without any frills.. The connectivity is as basic as it gets with Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0 LE. In a nice addition there is an FM radio. I do like how so many manufacturers include an FM radio in their software, and most of the times they work fairly well. The radio on the Y5 worked very well indeed with it picking up a surprising number of FM radio stations — sure there is always online streaming radio apps but they cannot stream AFL and many other events.. The display is a 5 inch IPS LCD display with a 1280 x 720 pixel resolution. The display was decent at producing colours but was one of the lower nit displays I have used. It’s maximum brightness was a long way off many other displays I have used.. The phone is powered by a 3000mAh battery. We are seeing some flagships with high end specs come in with battery sizes at this mark while at the same time having much higher specs. The battery life on the Y5 did not exceed most other phones I have used which may be due to the processor or any of the other cheaper components being less power efficient. The battery was big enough to last a full day on heavy usage but people buying a phone in this range are not normally heavy users so they would expect to get a lot more battery life than I did.. One thing to keep in mind though is that there is no fast charging on this phone. The charging is super slow — possibly how charging was before fast charging came along but it has been a long time since I have used a phone that charged this slowly.. The Y5 is decent without being dazzling in any one area. Reliable is what I would call it. It is slow and steady; not slow and laggy. You can see that it is doing something it just takes a bit longer than usual to do it. It still gets it done without any major holdups; it’s like your drunk Uncle talking to you at the end of a big night. He gets where he wants to eventually just takes a while to reach the destination.. One big plus for the Y5 is what I like to call the “Useful Bixby” button. It is a blank button called the “Easy Key” that can be mapped in multiple ways. The button is located on the left hand side of the device and can be mapped for three different functions, one each for a press, double press and a press and hold. Any app can be opened using the button as well as some shortcuts designated by Huawei. Samsung really should look at this implementation. Sure, make one of the functions always Bixby but surely they can make the button do other things that could actually be useful.. The phone is made of plastic, well, the backing is. The back is removable to be able to insert the SIM card and microSD. The plastic backing means that it is less likely to break than one of the glass-backed phones that so many manufacturers opt for these days. So while plastic is cheaper to make and definitely feels cheaper in the hand there are some positives to it.. Quick disclaimer before discussing the camera — the phone is a sub-$200 phone. Don’t go into it expecting to acquire Pixel or Galaxy S8 quality pictures.. The photos taken were ok while not being breath-takingly stunning. In good light I was able to take decent shots at the park with the kids, while as with most cameras in phones that are NOT flagships it struggled in low light conditions. As Huawei and many other manufacturers like to do the default setting for the selfie camera was with super-beauty mode. Sure I may need it to get a decent selfie but the resultant image looks incredibly fake.. For a person looking at purchasing this phone the camera is good enough. No one buys a cheap phone like this expecting to take DSLR-quality pictures. I hardly think Huawei will be putting billboards up everywhere with Y5 pictures with the tag line “#shotonY5”.. I hate sounding like a broken record but while manufacturers keep attempting to ruin Android I am going to keep calling them on it. Huawei have done a fairly decent job with EMUI on the P10 and P10 Plus but seem to have forgotten the advancements they have made when it comes to the software on their lower end phones. You would think that once the hard lifting is done with the software on the high-end, bigger margin phones the changes could be implemented along the entire range. Whether the lack of software enhancements included are a cost saving measure or related to the non-Huawei CPU inside (Mediatek don’t have a great record with their lower end chips for any type of ongoing support), it is very disappointing.. The launcher is even worse than on the P10 Plus and offers very few options and does not allow an app drawer to be implemented. Sure Nova Launcher, or any other third-party launcher can be used to fix this but the fact that Huawei continue to persist with such shoddy launchers is very disappointing. They are the third highest smartphone-selling manufacturer in the world and this is the best they can do?. There is also the common issue with many Chinese phones where it automatically turns off your accessibility settings after a random period of time or if the display has been turned off. For someone who uses SideControl, Pie Control and Last Pass which all require this accessibility access it is extremely frustrating. The Huawei P10 Plus does not do this anymore so possibly it has been fixed in the latest EMUI version; another reason it is annoying that they haven’t put the latest EMUI on the phone.. Continuing on with the software theme — the software is pure Huawei circa 2015. There are very few tweaks to Android in this incarnation. I’m not sure how much work it is to port some of their more useful tweaks to a lower-end phone but the cost of hiring someone to work on the software for that long is obviously inhibitive. The software was possibly the slowest I have used but having used mostly high-end phones my standards are quite high. While it was reliable, it was also reliably slow.. There is the standard Huawei Battery Manager that seems to work fairly well on the lower end phone but I still stand by the statement that Android in 2017 does (should?) not need such a thing — this is assuming Android has not been “messed with” too much.. Speaking of 2015, the software is based on Android 6.0. Not good enough Huawei when you have phones running 7.0. It’s not like the Y5 would have been in development that long — why not start with an Android 7.0 base?. That’s enough about the software, how about the hardware?. The display is one of the less touch-sensitive phones I have used. It definitely required a firmer touch for that touch to register; there is a setting within “Smart Assistance” to turn on “Touch screen high sensitivity mode” and is recommended “if you are using a screen protector that reduces screen sensitivity”. The only screen protector on is the one it ships with. Turning on this option does alleviate most of the display touch issues so much so that I wonder why they just do not make the setting permanent. The display’s accuracy wasn’t as good as most other phones either. Once again, sub-$200 phone will get you sub-$200 phone parts.. The is no fingerprint sensor on the phone which is extremely rare these days. It has been a long time since I have used a phone without a fingerprint sensor but it was something I got used to (although I would rather not). Yet again, sub-$200 phone, sub-$200 parts (or lack of).. While I seem to have mentioned a lot of negatives in the review sometimes that’s how a review rolls. It does not mean that we do not recommend a phone but we feel that you, the buyer, should be informed of the negatives we found.. The Huawei Y5 2017 is a plastic-backed phone which is slow, the display is not overly sensitive, and is without a fingerprint sensor. The software leaves a lot to be desired but much of it can be fixed with a third party launcher but the software is far from the worst I have used.. The phone, while slow, is reliable and just chugs away, doing what it needs to be doing. The camera is half decent without and the battery life should be enough for a full days use in those that this phone is targeted at. The display is a comfortable 5 inches and although it has a plastic back, feels good in the hand.. In the end it’s a sub-$200 device and I really cannot go past that. It may not be flagship quality but it doesn’t have to be at that price. If you, or someone you know, just wants a REALLY cheap phone that just keeps on chugging along getting the job done and takes half decent pictures then I can recommend the Huawei Y5 2017. One warning though, temper your expectations — it costs under $200.. The Huawei Y5 is available from The Good Guys now, and will be available from Coles, Australia Post and Big W from August 26th..

That’s funny because Huawei have an even worse record of never updating carrier gimped versions of their 2016 flagship phone, the P9. Anyone buying a Huawei handset should expect it will never be updated, low-end or flagship. Most P9s are probably getting dumped on eBay, etc by now due to Huawei’s refusal to address the update issue. Abandoning the low-end and refusing to keep their flagship customers happy, let’s hope they slip from 3rd place pretty quickly.. Share On Facebook Share On Twitter Share On Google.

Home Reviews Mobiles Huawei Y5 2017 Review – The Budget Phone. Huawei Y5 2017 Review – The Budget Phone. By Noaman Rasheed. microUSB cable for connectivity and charging. Huawei Y5 2017 - Hands-on | Image KA/TechProlonged. Huawei, like most brands, wants to target all segments of the market by providing access to smartphones to type of customers. Budget to lower and upper lower range of smartphones, mid-range and then lower/upper classes in the mid-range segment, then of course the high-end and upper high-end devices.. When talking about budget and lower-range of smartphones, you can find a real big lot in the market from various companies. Most recent one that also got famous is of course Infinix , but the company only offers within the lower and lower mid-range segments. OPPO has also taken its part in the mid-range and upper mid-range segments only. Nokia has also entered back into business with the lower mid-range segment while having plans to launch high-end devices soon .. The two – Huawei and Samsung are the ones who almost have really wide range of segments. The difference lies at the quality and performance of the handsets both ship in lower and budget range. It’s only a matter of fact that you get to know which company offers better quality and performance in a certain lower price bracket.. Huawei Y5 is the budget smartphone lineup Huawei has been offering and the new Huawei Y5 2017 is the most recent successor of the model after Y5 II of the last year. The new Y5 2017 costs only PKR 15,999/- (~$150) in Pakistan and offers a double-up in the processing performance.. Huawei Y5 2017 – Image KA/TechProlonged. The phone is powered by the MediaTek MT6737T, clocked at 1.4GHz the quad-core processor is improved and boosted version of the original MT6737. This budget phone also has a 2GB RAM and 16GB of internal storage.. Y5 2017 features an 8-megapixel autofocus camera on the back with f/2.0 aperture lens and dual-LED flash. On the front, there’s a 5-megapixel selfie camera.. The box is simple in a red color with a pop-out style. The retail package brings along everything you’ll usually look for when you buy a new smartphone. Huawei Y5 2017 Unboxed – Image KA/TechProlonged. Huawei Y5 2017 maintains on its size from the predecessors. The 5-inch screen features an IPS LCD display with 720p resolution which is quite acceptable for the price. However the design of the phone is just a regular one and doesn’t impress at all. The same wider bezels with extruded boundary wall raised above the screen.. Huawei Y5 2017 – Image KA/TechProlonged. The plastic frame is too fragile that you might need to take care of the phone more importantly from drops or you might want to add some extra protection with a back cover may be? I only recommend using those added protections if you do not care about the bulk to carry in hands. I’d better try to keep such things carefully rather adding them into protective boxes. On the front, you can see that the lower portion of the screen is just printing the brand name “Huawei” while on the upper portion, there are standard components – an earpiece in the middle, proximity and ambient light sensor, and a front facing camera.. Huawei Y5 2017 – Full View. If you are wondering about an extra white/yellowish component on the right upper corner, it’s the LED flash. Yes! the front facing camera features full fledged LED flash with auto and manual fire along with continuous light bulb option.. Other common components include the micro USB port on the bottom side of the phone along with the speaker grill. Another grill hides inside the primary mic – the mouthpiece. On top, there is only a 3.5mm audio jack.. Likewise on the right side of the phone, you will have the power button and the volume rocker. But interestingly, Y5 2017 also features an additional button on the left side of the phone. This is custom function button, they call it “Easy Key”.. The Easy Key offers quick functions to perform on three different events, single press, long press and double press. This key works even when the phone is in sleep mode or locked. When password locked, the key will only perform the functions which do not require password.. The plastic back cover is textured grid of small dot squares that you can easily feel with hand and it makes the grip good. The upper portion of the back hosts the camera module with dual-LED flash on the side. Above the lens, there’s secondary mic for noise cancellation and also for stereo audio recording.. The phone is more standard with removable back cover. I opens right with the finger nail from one corner easily. However like few other devices, Huawei Y5 2017 only allows you to remove back cover but not the battery. You just have to remove the cover to replace SIM card(s) or the micro SD card.. Battery is fully secured with with screws and you can not open it without tearing apart the warranty seal. That’s little overly packed phone in the price range. A full unibody form factor would have been more pleasing instead of just an un-useful opening of back cover.. Huawei Y5 2017 features a 5-inch screen with IPS LCD display serving at the HD resolution of 1280×720 pixels. The screen is pretty much flat across the frame and the glass on top of it is just not impressive. It captures fingerprints very easily – I liked it on Nokia 3 though .. The phone also has a auto brightness feature just like any other Android device but it seems to be handling the feature badly. It hardly worked out for me with a better adjustment of brightness relative to the available ambient light. Even it would fail detecting the bright light outdoors until you make it face towards some real bright part of the light – software update might fix this issue though .. The display is also not so good when viewing from different angles as well as it’s too reflective to look at it in bright sunlight and shadows. You can see the difference in the following video clips which were shot besides Nokia 3.. Huawei Y5 2017, as alone, doesn’t seem to be as bad as many other in this range would. The phone’s display mostly works fine in less bright environments. However auto brightness control indeed is an issue to be taken care of.. Huawei Y5 2017 runs Android 6 Marshmallow out-of-the-box like almost every smartphone in this range – except the Nokia 3 that runs Nougat. There is also no words about if an official Android 7 will be coming to this budget phone or not. But for now, you have to stick with Android 6. If you ask me, I am not among those who hate the Huawei’s 4.1 just for lacking an app drawer.. Sure the new EMUI 5 has a lot to offer which in turn impressed many out there – I am not denying that as well. However within this price range you will mostly end up with the older software, no matter what brand you are looking at. Android 7 on these budget phones will be big plus, take Nokia 3 for example but you won’t chose that either for hard performance with older chipset – read review .. User interface of Huawei’s EMUI 4.1 is pretty straight forward with absolutely no app launcher. Everything you install on it, appears on the home screen with its app icon. Multiple home screens, you can add. Organize apps into folders and add widgets to home screens. Mostly people refer Huawei’s EMUI as clone Apple’s iOS on Android.. The lock screen features a magazine style background delivery which you can even interrupt right between when the system is managing them on the lock screen. Thanks to quick short buttons which you can pull out from the bottom edge on lock screen.. The home screen can be customized with different widgets and wallpapers as well as the icon grid can be set according to your desire. The status bar has the same pull-down behavior that reveals two separate tabs for Notifications and Shortcuts.. Notification panel lists all the allowed notifications you receive on your phone which are interactive as well. They can be expanded by dragging within the item. Shortcuts on the other hand is 3×3 grid with switches and toggles that can also be customized to choose as you want but can not exceed nine buttons.. The “Easy key” as mentioned above in the design section provides three custom behaviors to interact with – Press, Double press, Press and hold. You can set these behaviors to allow the system to function accordingly. Such as setup “Double Press” to fire a flashlight, or “Press and hold” to open up the camera app.. Phone Manager is a must in Huawei’s EMUI like always. The built-in app comes with the features which include system optimization, data and traffic management, harassment filter for restricting numbers to call you or send you text.. The app is rich with more features – battery and power management, notification center dropzone management and protected apps which allow you enable/disable apps from running in the background. More importantly you can use app locker right from the Phone manager to secure from unauthorized usage of certain apps.. Huawei Y5 2017 features a MediaTek MT6737T system-on-chip with improved and boosted processor clock speed than the original chip. The phone is powered by a quad-core 1.4GHz processor with Cortex-A53 cores. To handle graphics and gaming importantly on the phone, the chip features Mali-T720 MP2 GPU. On the memory side we have 2GB of RAM.. What you should concern about is the storage. Sure in this price range, you are going to get more than 16GB of internal storage which this Y5 2017 or any other in the class would offer you. In addition, 6GB of the storage will be fixed for system firmware. Remaining 10GB will just end up in a matter of time when you were installing apps and taking photos and recording videos. You will have to take care of you social apps which usually download stuff automatically – you might want to turn off auto-downloads.. Performance wise, Huawei Y5 2017 was the best among its class fellows. Even though the similar hardware based Galaxy Grand Prime Plus of Samsung didn’t compare well. Let alone the Nokia 3 which practically did good most of the time but when tested on benchmark tools, it could achieve not more than half of what we have with Huawei Y5 2017. Gaming on the phone is also good but do not take it as your gaming phone, you will be disappointed.. So you can easily chose Huawei Y5 2017 among these if you prefer to have smooth experience. But do take a note that you might end up with software stuck at what it is now. On the other hand Nokia 3 is bound to receive security patches and even Android O is supposed to hit Nokia 3.. When you look at the numbers, Huawei Y5 2017 takes the lead from fellow Galaxy Grand Prime Plus and the Nokia 3. Look at the benchmark scores we noted from AnTuTu, Geekbench, Basemark OS II and Basemark X.. Battery performance of the Huawei Y5 2017 is also quite good and didn’t disappoint while doing great job throughout the day and even half more on a single full charge. But it’s not a fast charging phone, it can take hours to a full charge and that’s what a real issue.. Huawei Y5 2017 features an 8-megapixel autofocus camera with dual-LED flash. The camera comes with the features like HDR mode, beauty and Panorama mode. You won’t have other photography features which usually ship with upper mid-range and high-end Huawei smartphones.. The camera app opens with a viewfinder set to take still photos, while you can swipe left/right to switch to video mode or additional time-lapse and beauty modes. A hamburger icon on top right corner brings up options like panorama, HDR, and All focus.. 8 megapixel camera takes shots of 3264×2448 maximum resolution at 4:3 aspect ratio. The phone records up to 1080p video recording at 12Mbps bit rate. 720p video is recorded at 5Mbps. 30fps frame rate only possible in bright light while the indoor footage mostly ended up at maximum of 20fps.. On the performance side, the camera struggles with the focusing as only a bit of camera-shake may loose the focus. Noise levels are also high and noticeable in dark spots while the HDR mode brings some detail but the overall image looks over sharpened. Highlight clipping is too often as dynamic range is poor.. 5-megapixel front-facing camera also comes with its own single LED flash to brighten up your selfies. In good ambient light, front camera also manages to take some good shots. But in most cases when you’d want to take photos in your room or in limited lights, you may lose interest in those photos. The photos completely lack image detail and comes out with heavy noise – even flash couldn’t do any better. One thing – it’s too slow to capture steady shots unless you give it a few seconds and a fully stable standing.. The low-budget phones have various factors that do not impress at once but when you compare them with the competitor’s offering, this might help you a bit to chose one over another. Infinix has pretty much better software updates compared to QMobile and in fact has delivered Android Nougat on its lower cost Infinix Hot 4. Unlike that, you won’t have the Nougat flavor on Samsung’s Galaxy Grand Prime Plus or any other low-cost Android smartphones.. Nokia 3 is probably the one and only that comes out-of-the-box with Android 7 Nougat on board but that’s an exception. Putting an old and bad chipset in the phone is something I won’t recommend even if liked the phone’s build quality.. Remains is the Huawei Y5 2017 that according to its performance, I can tell that it’s better than the lot in its class. But it remains a quite old design as you’d see on every budget phone. It seriously do not attract your eyes when put together with Nokia 3.. It all depends on your preference if you want better performance for Rs. 15,999/- Huawei Y5 2017 is the option go..

Una duda porque cuando veo videos ya sea en google o whatsapp y los pongo en pantalla completa se ve un ratito ya luego miniminiza el video lo hace en pantalla pequeña y aparece el resto en verde alguien me puede ayudar gracias. El celular lo tengo dos meses, era buenoal principio pero ahora se demora en cargar como todo él día, se recalienta así no lo use y se descargue súper rápido. Y no sólo él mio, el de mi hermana también. Hace 8 días compré pero no tiene para conectar pantallas múltiples o tal vez está desactivado alguien sabe de eso?. Buen día, llevo alrededor de un mes de uso de este teléfono, me parece excelente, es un muy buen equipo. Recomiendo al cien por ciento su compra. El único problema que he tenido, y que espero alguien pueda sugerir que es lo que ocurre, es que en tres ocasiones ya, me ha borrado carpetas de fotos, creo una carpeta, y en cuatro o cinco días ya no está. No queda ni rastro de esas fotos. Como digo, eso ya ha ocurrido en tres ocasiones, sin embargo, hay carpetas a las que no les ha pasado nada de nada. Lo tengo hace como 6 meses , el teléfono me funciona perfectamente, el único problema que he tenido es que demora demasiado en cargarse.. yo compre un Huawei Y5 hace 20 dias estoy ocupando como 12 dias estaba bien hasta este fin de semana ,desde el domingo no habre ninguna foto,videos ni lo que llega por whatsapp ni tomando fotos no guarda absolutamente nada,alguien podria ayudar que pasa con el telef.oque se ase????. Hola una consulta,he leído todos los comentarios y todos conocen este celular como el y5 2017 o pro pero aquí en Perú ha llegado como el y6 lite y es el mismo teléfono con colores y todo con la diferencia de que la cámara principal es de 13 megapixel es resto igualito,y el único vídeo que existe en youtube de este terminal es justamente de Perú pero no hay mucha información en internet,me lo voy a comprar, pero también se que esta escaso cuando he estado preguntando saludos... Hola, tengo una duda y es que apenas compré este celular y la batería me dura solamente unas 4 horas, por qué pasa eso?.
