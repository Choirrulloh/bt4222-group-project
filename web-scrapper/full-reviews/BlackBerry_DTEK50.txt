The Good The BlackBerry DTEK50 is a slim, lightweight phone that's easy to use with a single hand. BlackBerry's software tweaks mostly improve the Android experience.. The Bad The camera struggles in low light, performance is a bit lacking, and BlackBerry's security claims are seriously overblown.. The Bottom Line In a crowded mid-range smartphone market, the DTEK50 doesn't stand out. It's a $300 phone that feels like a $200 one.. The new BlackBerry DTEK50 is sold as a BlackBerry phone that will make your personal information incredibly secure.. It isn't made by BlackBerry, doesn't run a BlackBerry operating system and doesn't really make your phone secure. And another thing: It doesn't come with BlackBerry's trademark physical keyboard, so fans of button-punching don't even walk away with that satisfaction.. Basically, it's your standard Android phone with a few tricks up its sleeve, and a lot of BlackBerry software tweaks. Does that add up to a phone worth buying? Probably not for many.. There's nothing explicitly wrong with the BlackBerry DTEK50, because there's nothing wrong with the Alcatel Idol 4 -- the phone which BlackBerry unapologetically cloned .. In fact, the new DTEK50 is better than recent BlackBerry phones in one important way -- it's an unlocked LTE smartphone that costs just $299 or £275 (roughly AU$390 converted). The BlackBerry Priv , its predecessor, originally sold for $750.. For the comparatively small amount of money, the DTEK50 isn't bad. It's surprisingly thin (at 7.4mm) and light (at 4.76 ounces, or 135 grams). While it's partially made of plastic, a black aluminum band with shiny silver beveled edges catch the light quite nicely and make it hard to drop. It's easy to use with a single hand, unlike many modern smartphones.. The 5.2-inch, 1,920x1,080-pixel IPS screen is perfectly competent, even if it's not a stunning AMOLED display, while a pair of stereo speakers (they face front and back) make it a pretty decent phone for the occasional Netflix session.. There's also a dedicated programmable button on the side of the phone to launch any app you want. While you can't use it when the phone is locked, it's decent as a quick flashlight or camera toggle.. Even the battery life is OK for a phone this small. It ran roughly 11 hours in our standard video streaming drain test. In my personal use, I usually make it home after a full day's work before the battery dies -- unless I play Pokemon Go .. For $300, the DTEK50 feels a good bit slower than I'd hoped. It always feels like there's a slight delay before the phone opens the app, summons the keyboard or loads the link I want. Our benchmarks bear that out, too. Raw performance numbers show the DTEK50 performing at about the same level as the Moto G4 , a phone that costs $100 less.. And it's a shame that BlackBerry's camera is so weak in low-light settings: I get super noisy, smudgy photos most places that aren't outdoors. I also found it much slower to focus or shoot HDR images than today's high-end phones.. It took more than dozen shots to get a flower photo this sharp from the DTEK50 camera. My Samsung Galaxy S7 did it on the first try..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. The world's most secure Android smartphone isn't half bad. If privacy and security are crucial when it comes to selecting a smartphone the DTEK50 will be right up your street, but for those just looking for solid performance at a reasonable price there are better options out there.. Super security Security built in from the ground up, with full data encryption Handy DTEK app pre-installed to give you complete control over privacy Design BlackBerry's thinnest-ever phone, but it's the same mid-range chassis as the Alcatel Idol 4 Practical, not premium, and easy to hold with a grippy soft-touch rear. The BlackBerry DTEK50 is the world's most secure Android smartphone.. So says the Canadian firm at least. It's a compelling claim too, as concern over personal security on mobile devices has never been higher – and the DTEK50 looks to play on that insecurity in people's minds by offering solid specs with enhanced protection.. The rather awkward DTEK50 name – taken from the DTEK security app which is pre-installed on the handset and its big brother, the BlackBerry Priv – doesn't do anything for the phone's appeal and gives it a decidedly business tone from the outset.. And wondering where the 50 comes from? It's a continuation of BlackBerry's numbering scheme – Q5 , Q10 , Z10 , Z30 – and it's deemed a jump to 50 the next logical step.. While BlackBerry calls the DTEK50 the world's most secure smartphone, the truth is that it has the same level of protection as the Priv – which means the firm actually has a pair of world-leading secure handsets.. Short on time? Check out our BlackBerry DTEK50 hands-on video:. The BlackBerry DTEK50 price is an attractive $299, (£275, around AU$400) considering its solid-looking spec list, and the phone finds itself rubbing shoulders with the OnePlus 3 , Nexus 5X and Moto X Style as it makes a case for your pocket.. The BlackBerry DTEK50 release date has been and gone – it went on sale back in July 2016 – and the phone is now widely available online and in some stores in key territories around the world, including the US and UK.. Those looking for a solid, affordable smartphone with added security could well be in luck – and the demand for this type of device is on the up.. The bold claim of "the world's most secure Android smartphone" is always going to come under quite a bit of scrutiny, but BlackBerry has a strong case with the DTEK50.. The firm has built in additional security at every level of hardware production, and enhanced Android's already robust defenses with its years of privacy and security know-how, as well as adding full data encryption of all your content.. That encryption prevents thieves gaining access to your personal details such as photos, banking information, emails and contacts.. To top it off the BlackBerry DTEK50 (like the Priv) comes with the DTEK app pre-installed, which makes checking and improving your phone's security status, and managing the permissions individual applications have, super-easy.. Don't like the fact that a particular application has access to your phone's microphone for no good reason? You can easily revoke access to just the mic, without uninstalling the app.. For its part Google releases a security patch update for its Android operating system every month, ensuring your phone is protected against the latest threats – but for many manufacturers it usually takes a few weeks to filter these patches to users.. Not with the DTEK50 though, as BlackBerry promises same-day updates whenever Google pushes a security patch – preventing hackers taking advantage of any newly-highlighted vulnerabilities. That's great news, and something we hope more firms will adopt going forward.. One surprising omission on "the world's most secure Android smartphone" is a fingerprint scanner – something we'd expect to be a nailed-on inclusion for an added layer of protection when it comes to mobile payments and unlocking the device.. Alas, though, BlackBerry wanted to keep costs down on the DTEK50, so the finger scanner didn't make the cut, but it feels like a missed opportunity to hammer home the security aspect of this phone.. Question marks are already being raised over the DTEK50's security claim, with Samsung claiming its new Galaxy Note 7 – complete with both finger and iris scanners – is more secure, thanks to its Knox platform.. This is likely to be an argument that rages on – but even if the DTEK50 isn't the most secure phone, it has a whole host of defenses to protect you and your data.. The BlackBerry DTEK50 isn't a flagship device. It slides in below the keyboard-toting Priv in spec and price, but with the removal of the iconic physical keys emerges a handset which will likely appeal to a much wider market.. It's no secret that BlackBerry has failed to do anything special in the design department. The firm has confirmed it used an off-the-shelf reference device from manufacturer TCL, and then tweaked the hardware and software to give it the BlackBerry look and feel.. In fact, the DTEK50 is a modified Alcatel Idol 4. It may not be the most appealing phone around, but it means BlackBerry can keep costs down while still delivering on performance.. Getting into the design, the DTEK50 features a grippy, soft-touch plastic rear which gives the handset a slightly rugged feel in the hand.. It won't be winning any awards for cutting-edge design or premium appeal, but the metal frame feels solid, and the manageable 147 x 72.5 x 7.4mm dimensions means it nestles nicely into the palm.. This is the thinnest BlackBerry ever, so if pocket bulge is a concern of yours the DTEK50 shouldn't worry you, and at 135g it's also surprisingly light.. Spend just a bit more, though, and you can bag yourself the supremely more premium OnePlus 3, which also has a stronger lineup of specs – which takes the shine off the DTEK50's offering a little.. Meanwhile the slightly cheaper (and older) Moto X Style has a similarly solid design with a touch more class about it.. The power/lock key resides on the left, while the volume rocker on the right is joined by a centralized round button, which BlackBerry calls the Convenience Key. It's reminiscent of Sony's power/lock key on its Xperia devices, and at first it's a little confusing, as it looks to be the more obvious power option.. Instead, this is a programmable button that enables you to access an oft-used app, task or function of your choosing. If you find yourself constantly firing up Instagram to check your follower count, or regularly diving into your email inbox, the Convenience Key provides a useful way of quickly accessing that feature.. However, we found ourselves reaching for this button a little too often for our liking when attempting to wake/lock the screen during our time with the DTEK50, which was rather annoying..

mAh Li-Ion non-removable battery. 13 megapixels , 1080p video capture, autofocus, Digital Image Stabilization. JerryRigEverything Durability Test (YouTube video). 1920x1080 pixels , 424 PPI. Wi-Fi : ( 802.11 a / b / g / n / ac ). BlackBerry DTEK50 is an Android smartphone co-developed and distributed by BlackBerry Limited , and manufactured by TCL , being a modified and rebranded variant of TCL's Alcatel Idol 4. Unveiled during a press conference held on July 26, 2016, [1] it is BlackBerry's second Android device after the BlackBerry Priv slider. As with the Priv, the DTEK50's Android operating system is customized with features inspired by those seen on BlackBerry's in-house operating systems, and with hardware and software security enhancements (such as the titular DTEK software). The DTEK50 received mixed reviews, with critics noting the quality of the phone's display and BlackBerry's software enhancements, but felt that BlackBerry's claimed security enhancements were redundant to security features included in the base Android OS, and that the device was not sufficiently competitive in comparison to other mid-range devices in its class. Currently the picture password is still lacking despite being available on Priv, DTEK60 and Key One.. The DTEK50 is manufactured by TCL , is similar in design to the Alcatel Idol 4 , although with a rubber backing instead of glass. [4] It is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 system-on-chip with 3. GB of RAM, and features a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS LCD display. GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD card, and a 2610. The device features a programmable "convenience key" on its bezel, which can be used for different features. [3] [4] [5] It features a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera with digital image stabilization and a dual-LED flash, an 84-degree wide-angle f/2.0 lens, and phase detection auto focus as well as an 8-megapixel front-facing camera with an f/2.2 aperture and flash. The DTEK50 ships with Android 6.0 "Marshmallow" , customized with additional features and BlackBerry-developed apps, similarly to the BlackBerry Priv, such as BlackBerry Hub, DTEK—which serves as a dashboard for notifying users of the security and privacy status of their device, and pop-up widgets. [5] [7] [8] BlackBerry has committed to releasing regular security updates to the DTEK50's Android software. The DTEK50 received mixed reviews, with critics suggesting that the device did not sufficiently differentiate itself from other smartphones in its class. Engadget positioned the DTEK50 as a " fleet device " meant to be purchased in bulk for adoption by a company's employees due to its low price and focus on security. The device was described as being "respectably well built and even sort of handsome (in an understated sort of way", and being thin and light yet not feeling "cheap". The DTEK50's display was considered to be "pretty damned good" for a mid-range device and only "fell short" in comparison to the similarly-positioned ZTE Axon 7 (which features a 1440p display). The convenience key was panned for not having as many supported features as the equivalent on the Idol 4. The lack of a fingerprint reader (especially given the device's wider focus on security) and inconsistent battery life was also panned. In conclusion, it was argued that the Moto G4 Plus was a better value at the same price point due to its larger amount of storage and inclusion of a fingerprint reader, and that "as a ploy to appeal to those crucial business customers, it's brilliant. For them, the DTEK50 is a solid, not-very-expensive option with the security chops to put IT paranoiacs at ease. As a phone for regular people, though, the DTEK50 is a much a tougher sell." [9]. The Verge felt that the DTEK50's display was "pretty nice for a $300 phone", but the overall hardware was described as being of average specifications. The DTEK50's Android software was praised for maintaining the user experience introduced by the Priv, but with fewer bugs and additional refinements. The camera was appraised as being decent "under ideal conditions", and poor in low-light situations. The phone's performance and battery life was also criticized. In regards to security, it was noted that Android "Marshmallow" had already implemented security features such as mandatory device encryption and finer control of permission grants, but that the DTEK software helped to promote privacy best practices, and that BlackBerry had consistently delivered Android's monthly security patches to its devices. However, the DTEK50 was panned for not including a fingerprint reader despite this focus on security. In conclusion, it was argued that while BlackBerry had "identified a market need and theoretically could do a great job filling it" with its security-oriented focus, the DTEK50 "fails to stand out in a competitive field of midrange smartphones." [10] [12]. CNET similarly pointed out that many of BlackBerry's claimed security enhancements "seem to either be placebos or functions already found on stock Android devices", such as device encryption (mandatory on Marshmallow) and boot verification (which is strictly enforced on Android Nougat , but with notifications on Marshmallow), [13] [14] and that the device as shipped was vulnerable to the Quadrooter exploit (which was patched on unlocked models at the time of the review). After receiving the heavy backlash about the price of DTEK50 in emerging markets like India, the Indian distributor OPTIEMUS have dropped the price and make it inline with the desired price tag of $300. ^ BLA1ZE (July 26, 2016).

Press enter or click on the search icon. BlackBerry has seen its influence rapidly decrease over the past few years, but I retain a soft spot for the company’s devices. I was a fan of BlackBerry’s first Android phone: the Priv may have been rather big and bulky, but it benefited from clever software features and a nice-ish keyboard.. It appeared to be BlackBerry conducting an experiment, to see whether or not people were still interested in physical keyboards. It turned out that they probably weren’t. As a result, BlackBerry’s follow-up ditches the keyboard and slips below the Priv on price. The DTEK50 showed promise, but it’s hugely let down by slow performance and terrible battery life.. With competition from the likes of the Moto G4 , OnePlus 3 and Vodafone Smart Platinum 7 , the BlackBerry DTEK50 ‘s issues will make it a difficult sell.. The BlackBerry DTEK50 isn’t an original design. In fact, it isn’t made by BlackBerry at all – the Canadian company has opted to save costs by basing its latest device almost entirely on a reference design by TCL, the parent company of Alcatel OneTouch.. As a result, the DTEK50 is basically a rebranded Alcatel Idol 4. Vodafone went down a similar path with its Smart Platinum 7, which is a slightly tooled up Idol 4S. It’s fair enough that BlackBerry doesn’t want to plough huge sums of cash into designing and building its own phone, but it almost suggests the company is tentative as it knows the device is doomed to fail.. Related: 12 Best Android Phones. Design-wise the DTEK50 is one of the dullest phones I’ve seen in a long time. It’s your typical black slab of plastic, with a dodgy faux-metal chamfer running around the edge. It’s neither eye-catching nor pretty, and it doesn’t have that feeling of durability seen with the Bold or Curve. Those phones were dense; the DTEK50 feels as though it might implode if dropped on a hard surface.. Above and below the display are speaker grilles that add a degree of flair – but it’s minimal.. There are a couple of redeeming features though. The dimpled, rubbery back seems odd at first, but I have grown to appreciate its grippy feel. In addition, a new “Convenience Key” sits right where you’d expect the home button to be. During my first three days using the DTEK50 I constantly hit this when trying to unlock the phone, but it’s actually a user-programmable button that I’ve since assigned to quickly bringing up my email inbox.. The buttons themselves are clicky and responsive and I like having the volume rocker and lock switch on opposite sides; this is a rarity these days. There’s no fingerprint scanner, which I assume was missed off to cut costs.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

It isn’t as small as the iPhone SE , but it’s much trimmer than the chunky Moto G4. Its 5.2-inch display helps, but the bezel is slim and it’s as thin as an iPhone 6S , making it very easy to use in one hand.. For the price, I’d expect a slightly more interesting design for the DTEK50, but at least it’s functional.. The BlackBerry features a 5.2-inch screen. Not long ago this was considered huge, but now it feels decidedly small. I like it though, it feels big enough for gaming and watching the odd YouTube video – certainly not films – but small enough that you can easily move your thumb from one side of the device to the other.. The screen’s overall quality is also good – but don’t expect to be blown away. The 1080p, IPS LCD panel is bright and is colourful without oversaturating reds and yellows. Viewing angles are decent, too, and it manages to stave off reflections when it’s sunny outside.. The DTEK50 features a temperature slider in Settings that enables you to make the screen warmer or cooler – and I’d suggest using it. By default it was the display was a little cool and everything felt a bit blue, but warming things up helped no end.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

BlackBerry's first Android phone was a curious, ambitious machine, so it's funny that the company's second turned out to be so ... The $299 DTEK50 is affordable from the get-go, lacks a physical keyboard and was basically tailor-made for corporations to buy in bulk. Seriously: BlackBerry has been pretty candid about the fact that this is a "fleet" device, a supersecure phone it hopes will attract companies trying to trick out their mobile workforce. BlackBerry is trying to pitch this to regular people too, though, and in the process, it's hurling the DTEK into a crowded, crazy-competitive pool of midrange phones. Spoiler alert: It's probably not for you.. BlackBerry's second attempt at an Android smartphone lacks the ambition of last year's Priv, but don't get hung up on that. The DTEK50 is a solidly built device with a super-secure foundation, and the company's take on Android continues to impress. Still, the competition among mid-range phones is fierce, while the DTEK50 has its share of rough edges. Think: underwhelming battery life and sometimes pokey performance. Altogether, the DTEK50 is a respectable phone that will have a hard time standing out to people who don't really care about security.. If you're reading this, there's a good chance you already know BlackBerry didn't design the DTEK50 by itself. Instead, the company chose a reference design from TCL -- the folks behind the Alcatel brand -- that offered the level of performance it was after. CEO John Chen has long said that BlackBerry would stay in the hardware game as long as there was money in it , and by customizing an existing design, the company just saved heaps of money on product development. The flipside is that the finished device doesn't really feel like a BlackBerry.. I'll be the first to admit that sounds a little silly, but still, I was a little worried when I first heard the news. BlackBerry has historically taken pride in designing its devices, from pint-size beauties like the Pearl series to last year's delightfully bonkers Priv. Pulling an existing design off a shelf and adding BlackBerry accents like a logo and a textured rubber back didn't sit right with me at first, even though the company maintains it's a pretty common practice.. Ultimately, though, it's safe to say that these concerns only really matter to mobile wonks like me. Once I got down from my high horse, I was met with a device that's respectably well built and even sort of handsome (in an understated sort of way). The company also says the DTEK50 is the thinnest BlackBerry ever, which helps explain the mediocre 2,610mAh battery squeezed in there. I'll dig into that a little later; for now, just know that the DTEK50 manages to be very light without ever feeling cheap. Gallery: BlackBerry DTEK50 revew | 29 Photos. Display and sound Software and security. Unlike last year's premium Priv, we're working with a midrange list of specifications: an octa-core Snapdragon 617 chipset with 3GB of RAM and an Adreno 405 GPU. Alas, there's no physical keyboard this time; you'll be typing your messages on a 5.2-inch, 1080p IPS LCD touchscreen. Flanking the display is a surprisingly capable pair of stereo speakers, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera and a notification LED up top. But don't get too excited, BlackBerry loyalists: It only blinks white. Meanwhile, the DTEK50's backside is home to a 13-megapixel camera (with phase-detection autofocus, no less) and a two-tone LED flash.. For a phone that's so focused on security, it's a little odd that the DTEK50 doesn't have a fingerprint scanner. The reason is purely practical: BlackBerry had to keep costs down. That's probably also why the DTEK50 comes with only 16GB of internal storage. (Thankfully, you can add up to 2TB of storage by way of a microSD card slot.). What we got instead of said scanner is a convenience key that sits below the volume rocker on the phone's right edge. The premise is simple, enough: You can set it to launch apps or perform specific actions like calling someone or turning on the flashlight. Alas, the convenience key isn't always very convenient. It won't work while the phone is locked -- something its distant relative, the Idol 4S, does just fine -- and you can't use it to snap a quick photo or take screenshots. More important, that key sits where most phones have their power buttons, and it took me an entire week to get used to that tricky placement. (If you'd rather not reset your muscle memory, you can make the convenience key unlock the phone too.). The Priv's fancy, curved AMOLED panel obviously wasn't going to make the jump into a midrange phone, but -- surprise, surprise -- the 5.2-inch LCD we got on the DTEK50 is pretty damned good. It runs at 1080p (that's a pixel density of 424 ppi, if you didn't feel like doing the math), making for plenty of crisp text and visuals. It lacks the sort of punchy colors and deep blacks we got from the Priv, but who cares? They're accurate, and the screen and scratch-resistant glass covering it are laminated together, so viewing angles are great. (If the color temperature doesn't do it for you out of the box, you can tweak it in the device's settings.). In fact, the only time the DTEK50's display seems to fall short is when you look at it next to other devices that cost about the same. ZTE's Axon 7 will cost only $100 more when it launches in the US in September, and it features a beautiful Quad HD screen. Would it have been nice to get a higher-res screen on the DTEK50? Sure. Would it have made any sense, considering BlackBerry is trying to sell these en masse to businesses? Not even a little.. The audio quality another pleasant surprise, given that BlackBerry has never paid much attention to it in the past. I always feel a little twinge of giddiness when a phone I'm reviewing has stereo speakers, and the DTEK50's offer crisp highs and decent channel separation for immersive sound. Even better, the speaker setup is replicated on the phone's back so the jams won't stop even when the DTEK50 is lying face down. Still, they're far from perfect: Most songs I tried sounded hollow. What's more, the DTEK's maximum volume isn't terribly loud, though it'll do fine for podcasts and YouTube videos. The DTEK50 also comes with Waves' MaxxAudio tuner, but your mileage may vary. The app's presets usually succeeded in making my songs sound different, but not necessarily better.. Now that the company is willing to almost completely outsource hardware design and production, BlackBerry's soul boils down to two things: software and security. Unless it nails both of those things, then, there's little reason to buy into the company's vision. As far as the former goes, there's no point in hiding it: I dig BlackBerry's take. Things haven't changed dramatically since the Priv's days -- the company didn't mess with Android 6.0.1 itself. Most of the same tricks are back and they still focus on getting things done fast.. Swiping up from the bottom of the screen, for instance, brings up shortcuts to the dialer, the Device Search app and BlackBerry's Hub. Long story short, the hub acts as a one-stop shop for your messages, be they emails, BBMs, texts, Facebook messages or Viber pings. I typically prefer the rush of pseudo-productivity that comes with jumping in and out of multiple apps, but it didn't take long to appreciate having a single place to triage all the stuff that flew into my inbox. (As a bonus, you can now download this app from the Play Store and use it on other Android devices too.). Gallery: BlackBerry DTEK50 software tour | 22 Photos. Meanwhile, peer closely enough at the screen and you'll see the edge of a tab all the way on the right. Swiping on that opens the Productivity tab, where you'll find a rundown of the day's calendar events, unread messages, tasks that need completing and favorite contacts (you know, just because). Just like Samsung's Edge UX, it's easy to forget the feature even exists, but it's handy when you do remember it's there.. If that wasn't enough swiping, you can view an app's widgets in a pop-up window (as opposed to finding room for them on your home screens) by swiping up on them. It's a neat touch that gives you extra context without having to fully open the app, but I never really use widgets in the first place. That swiping continues when you use BlackBerry's software keyboard. Fan that I am of Google's in-house keyboard, I love what BlackBerry has come up with: It's perfectly sized, it's precise and swiping up on word suggestions to complete messages is actually pretty fun. It's easily one of the finest keyboards available on an Android phone, which is only natural considering the company that made it. Curiously, though, one of the BlackBerry's neatest software touches didn't make the leap here: You can no longer set a Picture Password, which is puzzling because it worked fine on the Priv.. Obviously, the DTEK50's biggest selling point is security, and I haven't dwelled on it until now is because it's almost completely invisible to the person using the phone. You can't tell that a hardware root of trust was baked into the phone during manufacturing, just like you can't tell the phone is fully encrypted by default. The only real reminder that the DTEK50 is more locked down than most is the namesake DTEK app, which offers an at-a-glance look at how secure the phone is. But here's the rub: DTEK is what you make of it. You'll get a rating and a checklist of things that are or aren't going well on the phone upon launch, but after you take basic precautions like setting up a PIN, the app mostly just says everything is excellent.. It's when you dig a little further that DTEK's value really becomes apparent -- it outlines which apps have access to certain parts of the phone and counts up how many times those apps try to gain access. As of this writing, for instance, Facebook Messenger has tapped into my device's contacts nearly 500 times. In certain cases, you can even see where you were when an app tried to gain access. More important, permissions can easily be revoked and apps can be quickly uninstalled from within DTEK, making it yet another one-stop shop for functions that would normally be buried in settings menus.. I wasn't expecting much from the DTEK50's 13-megapixel camera. After all, BlackBerry hasn't had the best track record with imaging performance, and on at least one occasion it didn't bother with a camera at all. It turns out that fretting was for nothing: The DTEK50 won't win any photography awards, but both its main and front-facing cameras were respectable performers. That main sensor around back has a f/2.0 aperture lens and a phase-detection autofocus system; too bad it lacks the optical image-stabilization offered on last year's Priv.. Even so, my photos contained plenty of detail, with nicely balanced colors in good lighting conditions. Don't expect too much from the DTEK50 in low light; you'll see grain and soft edges everywhere (even after the phone applies it multiframe low-light enhancements). I really shouldn't have been surprised at the DTEK50's performance here -- midrange phones have become more impressive on all fronts, cameras included. That said, I still preferred the photos I took with the similarly priced Moto G4 Plus, which packs a 16-megapixel sensor and an additional laser auto-focus module.. Gallery: BlackBerry DTEK50 camera samples | 20 Photos. Performance and battery life The competition Wrap-up. BlackBerry still gets some credit for piecing together a good camera app, though. A shutter button lives on the right edge of the screen, with a handy exposure slider, mode selector and a panel of photo filter effects nearby for easy access. More serious photographers will get some mileage out of the included manual mode, which allows for finer control over focus, white balance, shutter speed, exposure compensation and ISO. It's not the most polished camera app, but it's enough to get the job done.. This is where things start to get hairy. The octa-core Snapdragon 617 (with four 1.5GHz cores and four 1.2GHz cores) is a well-known chipset at this point and has landed starring roles in phones like the fourth-generation Moto G line and the HTC One A9. For the most part, that combination of CPU cores and 3GB of RAM keep the DTEK50 running without issue. It's certainly not flagship level, but launching apps, multitasking and generally just getting things done generally aren't a problem. Graphically intense games sometimes threw the DTEK50 for a bit of a loop, but I could usually log plenty of time in Asphalt 8 with the visual settings cranked up before noticing any slowdown.. Once in a while, though, the phone would start to stutter, even during pretty basic tasks, before eventually returning to normal. I didn't see hiccups this frequently while playing with other 617-powered devices, though that's not to say they were immune to the occasional slowdown. I could usually clear things up by closing all running apps, and I suspect at least sometimes the problem was caused by using the DTEK50 out in the summer heat. Thankfully, these issues didn't crop up every day, and with any luck a post-launch software patch will help smooth things out a bit.. BlackBerry DTEK50 Moto G4 Plus BlackBerry Priv HTC One A9 AndEBench 5,758 16,371 7,505 7,570 Vellamo 3.0 2,741 2,819 3,461 2,585 3DMark IS Unlimited 9,529 9,851 19,200 9,076 GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan Offscreen (fps) N/A 6.6 15 6.6 CF-Bench 59,170 60,998 56,206 61,789. The battery, meanwhile, has been awfully hit-or-miss. BlackBerry and TCL fitted the phone with a 2,610mAh nonremovable cell that typically saw me through a full workday and then some before giving up the ghost. That's about 14 hours of pretty consistent, mixed use -- my days involve lots of phone calls, emails, Slack messages and card-slinging in Hearthstone , for the record. That's in line with what we've seen from other midrange phones, which makes the DTEK50's lackluster performance in our standard video rundown test so surprising. The phone looped a 720p video with screen brightness set to 50 percent and WiFi connected for just under eight hours, putting it well below the LG G5 (with a similar size battery) and either of this year's new Moto Gs. In fairness, that's not exactly a natural use case -- I don't know many people who'd watch videos on their phones for eight hours straight -- but it's still sort of a let-down.. BlackBerry clearly wants to sell tons of DTEK50s to businesses, and among corporate buyers, the company's storied brand and devotion to security might give the phone an edge. The thing is, BlackBerry is trying to sell these to regular people too, and on that front, the DTEK50 faces a much tougher fight. Consider this year's Moto G Plus, an enhanced version of the fourth-generation Moto G that launched alongside it. For $299, you'll get a phone with the same Snapdragon chipset as the DTEK50 but with more RAM (4GB), more storage out of the box (64GB), a better camera (16 megapixels), a fingerprint sensor and an almost-stock version of Android. Motorola's tight focus has wavered a bit -- there are more Moto models now than ever -- but the brand can still put out an excellent cheap phone.. The problem is, you could do so much better if you'd be willing to spend just a little more cash. ZTE's Axon 7 and the OnePlus 3 can be had for as little as $399, and they offer full-on flagship performance in impeccably built bodies. None of these options offer the same level of hardened security as the DTEK50, but if you're dead-set on a BlackBerry, you could find a Priv online for around $300. It might be a little older, but the Snapdragon 808 chip inside it is still no slouch, and you'll get a great physical keyboard, to boot.. It's been more than a week, and it's still hard to judge the DTEK50. As a ploy to appeal to those crucial business customers, it's brilliant. For them, the DTEK50 is a solid, not-very-expensive option with the security chops to put IT paranoiacs at ease. As a phone for regular people, though, the DTEK50 is a much a tougher sell. Make no mistake: The DTEK50 is a perfectly good handset, and I'll always appreciate BlackBerry for trying to keep security in the front of people's minds. Still, it takes more than that to make a smartphone great, and BlackBerry's approach won't be for everyone. Unless you're a BlackBerry loyalist or you take your security very, very seriously, you're better off setting your sights elsewhere.. blackberry , gear , mobile , review , uk-reviews , video.

A fine balance between hardware and price. DTEK50 is BlackBerry's second Android-powered smartphone offering unique security and connectivity features BlackBerry is known for.. The release of the Priv was BlackBerry's first trip into the Android world, and it was not without some bumps in the road. The BlackBerry Android software, at the time, still had room to grow and pricing was a little on the high side for a lot of folks. Now, the DTEK50 is here, BlackBerry's Android software has had time to grow and improve, and we're once again taking a look at what BlackBerry brings to the Android world.. For their second Android offering, BlackBerry sought out a balance between hardware and pricing and personally, I think they might have found it with the DTEK50. It offers BlackBerry's security, privacy and productivity coupled with the Android ecosystem and it's priced to move for its intended audience of enterprise fleet deployments and price-conscious consumers.. Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 out of the box. Bigger battery would have been appreciated. Before we get right down to the nitty gritty, let's just go ahead and address the elephant in the room. Yes, the DTEK50 is based off a reference design produced by TCL. Most folks reading this will likely know it better as the Alcatel Idol 4. Does that take away from the experience or hinder the offering in any way? Not in my opinion. In fact, the combination of TCL's design with BlackBerry's changes may have helped improve the device in some ways.. Yes, the DTEK50 is based off a reference design produced by TCL.. When you take the DTEK50 out of the box, the first thing you're likely to notice is the weight, or perhaps I should say lack of weight. Coming in at only 135 grams or 4.76 ounces, DTEK50 is the lightest smartphone that BlackBerry currently offers in their line up. Plus, it's also the thinnest as well coming in at 7.4 millimeters or 0.29-inches deep. There's an argument to be made there that, maybe they should have added a bigger battery instead of making it as light and as thin as it is but we'll get there further on in this review.. On the front of the device, you'll find the scratch resistant, and smudge resistant 5.2-Inch LTPS IPS display is coming in at a resolution of 1920x1080 and 424ppi. As expected, colors on the DTEK50 display are nice and vivid, the text is clear and even close up there's no fuzziness to the icons and viewing angles are where they should be. Even in sunlight where some displays end up useless, DTEK50 is still viewable. One thing I did notice during some comparisons with my Priv was that the DTEK50 display turned out to be much brighter when the settings were maxed out on each and placed side-by-side. Obviously not a bad thing for prospective DTEK50 owners, just an interesting observation. Also on the front of the device is where you will find the proximity and ambient light sensors as well as the 8MP front-facing camera and finally, LED notification light which doubles as a front-facing flash. There have been a lot of questions and concerns surrounding that LED light, so let's just be clear. It's not an RGB LED, and the only color you will see it produce is white, but still there's a notification light there. For me, it's not that big of a deal but there are certainly plenty of folks out there who feel as though not having that blinking red light is a downside to owning a DTEK50. Look carefully on the front and you will also spot the integrated dual speakers and dual microphones.. It's not an RGB LED, and the only color you will see it produce is white, but still, there's a notification light there.. Start making your way around the DTEK50 and on the right-hand side is where you will find your volume up and volume down rockers in chrome accents, though unlike Priv, there is no separation between the buttons. The volume up and volume down are one big button so you have to be precise when tapping them otherwise you will just hit somewhere in the middle. Also on this side is where you will find the BlackBerry convenience key, which is customizable, and provides quick access to your most used applications, tasks, and more. Additionally, below the convenience key and well hidden is the NanoSIM and the expandable up to 2TB MicroSD Card slot.. Head to the left-hand side of the DTEK50 and all you will find is the power and reboot button also with chrome accents. Priv users will be familiar with the placement of this button but on DTEK50, it moves a little bit higher to the top. Personally, I don't mind it being on the left-hand side, even as a right-handed user, but for some this is a bit of odd placement for the power button.. On the top and to the left is where you will find your 3.5mm headphone jack and at the bottom of the device to the left is where you will find your MicroUSB 2.0 charging port. No USB-C found here and much like the Priv, and I am once again OK with that. Also keep in mind that MicroUSB port is Quick Charge 2.0 enabled so that you can charge your device to around 50% in approximately 51 minutes, according to BlackBerry.. No USB-C found here and much like the Priv, and I am once again OK with that.. Flip the device over and this is where you will spot the first sign of the DTEK50 being a BlackBerry. Save for the software with BlackBerry branding loaded onto the device, the back side is the only spot where you see the BlackBerry logo, and it looks pretty great combined with the carbon grey that surrounds the device along with the chrome accents and chamfered edges. For those concerned about whether or not the DTEK50 is slippery to hold, I don't think you'll have to worry. The edges have a nice rubbery texture to them that helps with grip, and the non-removable backplate has a nice soft touch finish with a criss-cross pattern on it. Sure, it's not as 'sticky' as the back on the BlackBerry Priv, but it does the trick and looks pretty damn good. Also on the back is the 13MP camera that boasts features like Phase Detect Auto Focus, Dual Tone LED Flash and more.. Mostly stock Android with some BlackBerry love. As noted earlier, for DTEK50 BlackBerry sought out a balance between hardware and pricing and because of that, we got a device that is considered to be 'mid-range' when it comes to the specs. For some, that might be an instant turn-off, but there are plenty of folks out there who need these sort of devices.. ƒ/2.0, Phase Detect Auto Focus, Dual-LED flash. Contextual auto-correct, word prediction, and learning engine. Like most mid-range devices on the market, the DTEK50 doesn't tick off every checkbox on the spec sheet checklist but overall, for what you're paying and what you get, it offers a pretty compelling package.. Back when the Priv was released in November of 2015 , one of the biggest observations was the how little BlackBerry screwed with stock Android, and that's something that carries over to DTEK50 as well. Since then, though, BlackBerry has had the chance to improve their Android software and those BlackBerry touches, whenever you see them on DTEK50, are now more refined and improved upon from when the Priv first launched. Not going to lie, if you already own a Priv, you may find this software run down a bit boring to read because you already know how this works but for the uninitiated, here are some of the highlights from BlackBerry's version of Android.. Widgets on Android are a great way to get information quickly from an app or take action without actually jumping right into the app itself but often those widgets take up a lot of space on your home screen, and that can be annoying. On the DTEK50, you have the option of enabling BlackBerry pop-up widgets, which allow you to view any app widget by simply swiping up or down across the icon on your home screen, giving you fast and private access to the information you need, when you need it.. Not all apps support widgets, unfortunately, but those that do will have a thee-dot indicator beneath the app icon. When you first swipe up or down on the icon, you can then choose which widget to set as the pop-up widget. If the app provides multiple widgets, you are presented with the widget options and from there you can choose which to go with, and it will remain set on that unless you wish to change it. Changing the widget once decided is easy as well, just when the widget is open, look in the top right for the three dots again. From there, you can disable the widget or change which it is using. Keep in mind not all apps offer widgets and in order to use pop-up widgets, the app icon must be on your home screen.. As part of the process of improving their Android software, the BlackBerry Hub has improved a lot from when Priv was released, though, its core function of being an irreplaceable tool for consolidating all of your messages in place remains the same. Initially, out of the box, the Hub supported Email, Twitter, Facebook, Text Messages, Call Logs, LinkedIn and of course BBM but recent updates have now added even more to the mix including WhatsApp, Slack, Instagram, Viber, Pinterest.. Additionally, the most recent update has now brought the fan-favorite 'pinch to filter' functions over from BlackBerry 10. With a simple, familiar gesture, Hub will filter to your choice of snoozed items, unread items, emails marked as high importance, flagged emails, or muted conversations. By default, the pinch gesture filters to unread messages, including both email and integrated social / instant messaging content, which can be customized by visiting Display and Actions in BlackBerry Hub and tapping Pinch Filter Criteria.. The most recent update has now brought the fan-favorite 'pinch to filter ' functions over from BlackBerry 10.. Having the ability to triage your inbox quickly is a key function of the BlackBerry Hub. Customizable left and right swipe gestures allow you to delete, snooze, flag, file, mute and mark read or unread messages while custom views allow you to personalize what you see in the Hub based on specific criteria whether it be unread messages, flagged messages, important messages or only those with attachments. These are all options you can change, so how you set it up is entirely up to you and everyone loves options when it comes to controlling how you get things done.. The BlackBerry Hub also includes the ability to define account colors, customize quick responses, conversation view, the option to show sent and filed emails, and of course, the option to delete on Hub only or Hub and server plus the option to have it prompt you each time for a choice. Additionally, you can still download images automatically and set up custom alerts for different contacts and messages based on user defined rules. Last but not least, the calendar peek option allows you to drag down all your calendar appointments from the top of the Hub for quick viewing or even for adding to your calendar.. All in all, the BlackBerry Hub is awesome but truthfully I was genuinely concerned about how the DTEK50 would handle it given the Snapdragon 617 processor. As it turns out, my worries were rather unfounded because, in my testing, the lower-specced processor didn't really seem to have an effect on how well the Hub handled the load of information coming into it and to be fair, the recent updates to the Hub have cleaned up a lot of what I can only sum up as 'code' that was causing it to act perhaps slower than it should have in the past.. On the go and need to find some files on your device quickly, no matter where they are? BlackBerry Device Search is a powerful software inclusion that can help. You can find what you need by searching your Contacts, Calendar, BlackBerry Hub email, documents, media files, and more. The BlackBerry Device Search app also offers a remote search option if the info you are looking for is not found on your device.. You can also type what BlackBerry calls Instant Actions into device search. Instant Actions are shortcuts that allow you to perform tasks quickly. In the search field, type a command such as phone, dial or call to place a call or email, mail to send an email. Other options include sending text messages, playing music or even getting directions.. As part of offering the full package of BlackBerry tools, BlackBerry has included their own contacts app on both Priv and DTEK50. Of course, there is no requirement to use BlackBerry's offering if you wish to use a third-party app but with features such as remote search, recent contacts management that allows for blocking recent contacts, plus smart filters and contact groups, BlackBerry's contacts application is there and works just fine.. In fact, if your contacts are messy from using other apps, BlackBerry's contacts app just might be able to help you clean that mess up. Such was the case when I moved from BlackBerry 10 to Priv and DTEK50 maintained those changes for me. My contacts list is starting to look like those you would see in phone demos, all neat and organized in a way that makes you wonder how they even managed that.. As with the Contacts app, BlackBerry has also included their own calendar app and to too has had many improvements since its initial release on Priv. With the BlackBerry Calendar, you can view and respond to your meeting invitations directly from the BlackBerry Hub and by using the Join Now feature, you can instantly dial into your meetings directly from your event reminder. Additionally, you can use Google Now voice commands to book meetings and schedule appointments. Like everything else, though, there's no requirement to use it if you prefer to use something else, but it does enhance the overall experience of using DTEK50.. With the introduction of the Priv and its dual-curved edge display, BlackBerry also introduced the BlackBerry Productivity tab, which, provides glanceable views of the most pertinent info from Hub, Calendar, Tasks, and Contacts. Just tap on any of the four icons and ideally, you get a quick look at everything that is happening.. Interestingly, though, the Productivity Tab has not seen the same level of improvements as other areas of BlackBerry's software. For example, you still can't change any of the apps which appear on there and as such, you're stuck using only what BlackBerry offers. There's nothing wrong with that if you use those apps but if you don't, then chances are you're going to go ahead and disable it. BlackBerry doesn't force its use on you.. Truthfully, I never really used it on my Priv because I just wasn't that into using it and on DTEK50, it feels as though it has become more of a nonessential feature to me because it's a bit harder to trigger if that makes sense. On the Priv, there's that curved edge there to help you 'push' it out, but DTEK50 is flat and has no curved edge. Although it might all be in my head, it feels as though it's harder to swipe it over and use the Productivity Tab.. Still, it has a place on the device, and it is an added feature that I'm sure a lot of folks are using. It just so happens that I'm not one of those people who uses it on a daily basis, and there's nothing wrong with that.. As a part of BlackBerry's Android security offerings, the Priv and DTEK50 come preloaded with BlackBerry Password Keeper. For the uninitiated, the BlackBerry Password Keeper application allows you to keep all of your passwords, login information, and important records safe and secure. Your information is encrypted using AES-256 and protected by a single password of your choice.. Additionally, you can use the Password Keeper app to create secure passwords. If you're using the BlackBerry Keyboard, you can easily insert your saved login info into apps and web pages, and save your login info straight to BlackBerry Password Keeper with autofill.. As part of their suite of apps, the DTEK50 also includes the awesome BlackBerry Intelligent Keyboard. For anyone who has used a BlackBerry since the release of BlackBerry 10, everything here should be familiar but in case this is your first Android BlackBerry, here's what you need to know about the BlackBerry Keyboard. The keyboard learns and provides suggestions as you type and let's you 'flick' them into place.. Swiping horizontally from right to left anywhere on the keyboard will delete previously typed words one-by-one. Swipe vertically from top to bottom and you can toggle between letters, numbers and characters. If that's not enough, you can also slide your finger from letter to letter to quickly type with one or hand without even lifting your finger off the keyboard. Plus, the keyboard can handle up to 3 languages of your choice all at the same time.. All-in-all, the virtual keyboard is a keyboard you would expect from BlackBerry and is one of the best keyboard apps out there in my opinion. Worst case, you don't like it and prefer to use something else. No big deal, you can do that. Just grab your favorite keyboard app from the Google Play Store and use it but at least give the BlackBerry Intelligent Keyboard a go. There's a reason BlackBerry is still keeping it to themselves .. Hardened Linux Kernel : We reduce the Android attack surface with numerous patches and configuration changes to improve security. Hardware Root of Trust : During manufacturing, we establish a Hardware Root of Trust that adds security keys to the processor on every DTEK50 and Priv as it is built. Those keys track, verify, and provision each device – meaning that the authenticity and integrity of your device is guaranteed, as is the safety of the data it holds. A Better Bootloader : Because of our secure boot process, you can trust that only an untampered, BlackBerry-signed OS can be loaded. Each stage of the secure boot chain must first verify that the next component is fully intact before proceeding. FIPS 140-2 Compliant Full Disk Encryption : U.S. Government-grade encryption protects your private information, like personal pictures or banking info, if your phone is lost or stolen. Ongoing Security Patching : Many popular smartphones put the user's private information at risk of being hacked due to slow security updates – weeks, months, or even years after a patch is released. BlackBerry's record of being the quickest to deliver Android security patches minimizes your vulnerability. BlackBerry Integrity Detection (BID) : We continuously monitor Priv and DTEK50 for events or configuration changes that indicate a compromise to device security, then we trigger real-time actions if a threat is detected. Dedicated Security Research & Response Teams : We bring our world-renowned security experts and testing to our line of BlackBerry secure smartphones powered by Android.. When BlackBerry released the Priv, it was introduced as a secure smartphone powered by Android and BlackBerry laid out a ton of reasons as to why they were in the best position to create such an offering. Now, with the release of DTEK50, we're once again hearing that message from BlackBerry only this time around it's much louder.. Rather than just stating the DTEK50 is a secure smartphone powered by Android, the DTEK50 was introduced as 'the world's most secure Android smartphone' and BlackBerry has made no bones about telling anyone that. In fact, they've wisely made it a core selling point for the DTEK50 while also explaining what they've done and continue to do to make their Android offerings secure. So what is it that they do above and beyond others? Here's a list:. Arguably, the biggest highlight there is the ongoing security patching. When Priv was released, BlackBerry committed to monthly Android security updates, and they have done an outstanding job sticking to that. So outstanding in fact, the monthly security updates often show up even before Google releases them for Nexus devices and if you're a BlackBerry Beta Zone member, there's a good chance you have the updates even before Google officially announces what has been addressed. In a world where some Android OEM's are flat out telling customers they won't be sticking to regular security updates, BlackBerry keeping pace here is worth noting. Monthly security patches are important to everyone and for some this part of Android is certainly broken.. This is one area where those who say the DTEK50 is just a re-badged Alcatel Idol 4 are very wrong. Sure, the DTEK50 may look similar to an Alcatel Idol 4, but the software on the inside has been revamped by BlackBerry and is subject to BlackBerry's current update schedule for their Android devices. This should be an important factor when deciding if the DTEK50 is a device for you or if you want to go with some other device that might not have the commitment to security and updates that BlackBerry does. I like updates and I like knowing that my device is secure as possible and I like knowing that if something happens in between updates where it might not be, BlackBerry will be issuing a fix to correct it as soon as one can be released. Even if some of the latest exploit news is a bit blown out of proportion .. Given the name of the device, it should come as no surprise that one of the security highlights of the DTEK50 is BlackBerry's DTEK app. As I noted in my Priv review, DTEK felt a bit premature when it was made available on Priv with Lollipop because there was very little you could do by way of adjusting the device and app permissions when DTEK found something to be suspect. Now though, with DTEK50 and Priv being on Marshmallow, not only do you get the visual representation of what is happening on your device with your OS and apps, you can take action by adjusting the permissions as you see fit.. Overall, DTEK is a great way to monitor, control, track and be alerted of the security rating of your device but it's not perfect either. For example, it's great for finding intrusive apps that are pinging your contacts, accessing your microphone, snooping into your files and more but you need to consider that some of those apps are doing those things for a reason, and if you revoke some permissions, the app might not work.. Plus, sometimes the Android way of doing things with apps may look intrusive or abusive, but there's generally a good reason for it looking or behaving that way. Still, adding another layer of protection to your device is never a bad thing, and that's where DTEK comes in. Personally speaking, I think folks should consider DTEK a guide for helping them make better security decisions – not count on it to make the decisions for them.. Just enough to get you through a day. This one of those areas where I'm still being spoiled from having owned a BlackBerry Passport and the battery efficiency that BlackBerry 10 afforded. With that being said, the DTEK50 packs a non-removable 2610 mAh battery which according to the spec sheet should get you up to 17 hours mixed battery life. In my testing, those claims are pretty accurate for the most part.. That's not to say I don't wish BlackBerry had given up some of the thinness of the DTEK50 for a bigger battery because I certainly wish that was the case. These days, I gauge my battery performance based on whether or not it can last me a whole day or more and with the DTEK50, I found myself reaching for that MicroUSB cable near the end of my night or having to 'top up' the battery before calling it a night.. For the sake of testing, I 'forgot' to plug my DTEK50 in before bed as most people do these days, just to see if it would have enough juice to get me going in the morning and I was unsurprisingly disappointed. Luckily, the DTEK50 does include Quick Charge 2.0, which makes up for it a bit by being able to take in 20% battery life in around 10 minutes but there's a bit kicker there as well. You'll need to pick up your own Quick Charge 2.0 compatible cable if you don't have one already as one is not included in the box.. In all of the documentation for the DTEK50, BlackBerry calls the camera 'dazzling', and while the cameras are not terrible on the DTEK50, I don't know if I would call them dazzling either. For me, the 13MP rear shooter turned out to be one of those cameras where when settings were ideal I could get some great results. Anything less than ideal and you just end up with acceptable images. One highlight, though, is the 8MP front-facing camera that makes the Priv's 2MP front-facing camera look even worse than we already know it is. On the DTEK50, it's not really an issue. I was genuinely surprised by some of the results from the front-facing camera. Plus, there's also that front-facing flash that really helps improve your selfie game even in low-light, if you're into that sort of thing.. For snapping photos, the DTEK50 does come pre-loaded with BlackBerry's own camera app which has been updated and improved multiple times now. The BlackBerry built camera app offers a wide array of built-in features such as filters, quick access to advanced settings like the flash, aspect ratio, and HDR, and you can slide your fingers apart or together on the screen to zoom in.. One newer item on that list is manual controls but on DTEK50, those manual controls are not simply confined to the BlackBerry Camera App. Unlike on Priv, where manual controls are left to BlackBerry's Camera app, DTEK50 supports Camera2 API opening the doors to other camera apps such as the fantastic Manual Camera if you wish to use that instead.. In the video department, DTEK50 can record up to 1080p video at various frame rates. There's no 4K recording here as on the Priv, but that was expected. Overall, the video results are on par with that of the camera results. Great under ideal conditions but anything less than ideal and you just once again end up with acceptable offerings.. To put this section to bed, I think the camera is perfectly fine and capable for most situations and at times might even surprise you in the quality it can produce. Just don't count on being surprised every single time because that won't happen.. Not having a dedicated camera button to fire off the shutter kind of sucks, but on the flip side you can set your convenience key to launch the camera or use the Marshmallow feature of hitting the power button two times to launch it, so that's cool.. Plus, if a photo doesn't turn out as great as you had hoped, well, chances are you're just going to fire it through Prisma, Snapchat, or Instagram and add a filter to it anyway. Don't be mad at me for saying that. It's the same thing I do. Have a look at some sample shots.. So what's the rest of the experience like using DTEK50? It's not bad at all. The Snapdragon 617 processor backed up by the 3GB RAM handles mostly everything you toss at it and should be adequate for most people in my opinion. Now and then when you're doing something processor intensive you'll catch a slight bit of lag but it never really sticks around, and it's never while using basic apps. Only heavy apps and games seem to cause a hiccup here and there.. When it comes to using the DTEK50 as a phone it does come in a little weak. While calls and speakerphone sound great in a basic room or office when you step outside and place some calls things start to sound a little soft and less clear. Overall, it's fine just not great. Keep in mind, my comparisons here are pretty much based on Priv and Passport as I still frequently use those two devices. The call situation wasn't related to network signal either.. I tested the device on the T-Mobile network in Arizona and always had great signal with fast LTE. Traveling back to Canada, I made use of the Rogers network in Halifax and staying attached to the networks wasn't really an issue either. All around, the network and connectivity on the DTEK50 is pretty good, from the network to WiFi (802.11b/g/n/ac) to GPS and NFC. PS: Don't expect a CDMA version. That's probably a good thing, considering Verizon can't even manage to roll out Marshmallow to the Priv as it is when every other North American carrier has managed to do so, nevermind giving them another device.. For you folks who believe USB OTG is the best thing since sliced bread, you don't have to worry about losing that option on the DTEK50. Provided you have an adapter to use; you can connect your USB drive, and it will be detected just fine.. If you like jamming out to music on your phone, you'll find the speaker situation similar to that of speakerphone calls. The DTEK50 sounds great in a room or an office but anything beyond that is a little weak. Through headphones, it's adequate as well. Just do yourself a solid and skip using the included headphones, they'll do you no favors.. Interestingly, BlackBerry decided to leave two things from the Idol 4 base here. An audio application called Waves MaxxAudio which acts like an equalizer app for the whole device and there's also an FM Radio application that works when headphones are plugged in. Such a small thing to include but I know a lot of folks like having one so it's certainly worth mentioning.. When the rumors BlackBerry was going to release a mid-range Android device started to appear, I wasn't really sure what to expect as an end result. As it turns out, the DTEK50 is a nice looking device that is pretty much up for anything you throw at it and while it doesn't include all the latest and greatest features, some are really bummed out that there's no fingerprint sensor , that was never BlackBerry's intent.. Their intent was to find a nice balance between the hardware and pricing and when you consider a DTEK50 only sets you back $299 USD, it's a pretty complete package and one that I can recommend picking up should you be in the market for a smartphone that does a lot of things well but won't break the bank while doing them.. DTEK50 is available to order from ShopBlackBerry.com in the US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and The Netherlands. Over the next few weeks, DTEK50 will be available in a number of channels around the world, including more than 40 partners from electronics stores and carriers. This includes Rogers, Bell, TELUS, WIND, Videotron and SaskTel among others in Canada. In the U.S., DTEK50 will initially be available in Best Buy, B&H and Amazon and additional global channels and countries will be announced soon.. Careers: Writer | Dev.

Sony will sell its wireless 'open-ear' buds in the US. A day with BlackBerry's all-touch DTEK50 smartphone. What, exactly, does $299 get BlackBerry customers?. BlackBerry pulled back the curtain on its new DTEK50 smartphone a few days ago, and soon after gave hungry journalists units to play with. I'm still working on my full review of BlackBerry's $299 Hail Mary pass, but since I spent a day playing with it, here's a peek into an evening of nutso, BlackBerry-centric thinking. Long story short, it's all at once a perfectly adequate phone with serious security chops, a shrewd business move and a lesson in lousy marketing.. 1 PM: After a handy Q&A session, I'm given a DTEK50 of my phone to play with. First impressions: Yep, this feels like an Alcatel phone. In case you missed it the other day, the DTEK50 is based on the TCL reference design that ultimately gave us Alcatel's (still-unreleased) Idol 4. Both share a 5.2-inch, 1080p screen, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 chipset, 3GB of RAM, a 13-megapixel main camera, a 2,600mAh battery and even a convenience key on the phone's right side to which you can assign shortcuts. (Alcatel called it a "boom" key, but BlackBerry's naming choice was the right one.) If you're like me, though, you'd keep trying to wake up the phone using that button, which doesn't work unless you specifically set it to.. There's no fingerprint sensor, and it only has 16GB of internal storage. (You can at least you can beef it up with a microSD card.) The DTEK50 is startlingly light, too, lacking the reassuring density of the high-end BlackBerry Priv .. It's a BlackBerry in name and in functionality, but this is the first time I can remember the company leaving hardware design almost entirely up to someone else. Even the low-cost Leap we first met last year felt more substantial. There was a certain level of aesthetic pride that went into BlackBerrys, but the company's shift in strategy has given us a phone that doesn't feel special in the way the company's older phones did.. Gallery: First look: BlackBerry DTEK50 | 14 Photos. 2:30 PM: Ran down to St. Marks to get some footage of the DTEK50 for our hands-on video. Setting up the phone was business as usual, but the phone got noticeably warm for reasons that weren't readily apparent. At the same time, battery drain kicked into high gear for a spell, even though few apps were running at the time. My hopes for this phone start to sink a bit.. 4:30 PM: Hustled back to the office to give the DTEK50 a much-needed charge. Thankfully, Qualcomm's QuickCharge 2.0 tech got the phone back on its feet within minutes and I let it regain about a half charge. I fiddled with it more in the meantime; it's a pretty smooth little machine, and the DTEK50 seemed like a decent, slightly underpowered workhorse. It would've been nice to see BlackBerry choose a reference design with a beefier chipset like a Snapdragon 652, but the company wanted to keep costs down. I haven't yet gotten a great feel for the camera but early test shots seemed in line with other devices that cost the same, and the screen's pretty decent, to boot. Meanwhile, my boss Dana says the DTEK50's textured back reminds her of a cat's scratching post.. 6:30 PM : My latest meeting ends and I'm back at the office contemplating the DTEK50 again. BlackBerry insists that the DTEK isn't a rebranded device -- it's a standalone smartphone with security as its biggest selling point. From security keys baked into the processor during manufacturing to the full-disk encryption that's enabled by default, It's clear that BlackBerry's security know-how is one of its most powerful assets.. You won't notice much of that in practice, though. The phone's namesake DTEK app gives you a quick look at how secure your device is and how you can lock it up even further, but that's really all the insight you'll get. On the plus side, though, DTEK also gives you the option to manage your apps' permissions from inside it, which is a nice touch made possible by Android Marshmallow.. If you've used a Priv before, you'll feel immediately at home with the DTEK50's software features. As usual, you can manage your messages from the BlackBerry Hub and swipe up on app icons to see their widgets. The DTEK50 is another mostly-stock-Android affair, and I'm warming up to it more because of that. It certainly doesn't hurt that the company's secure-software approach hasn't impeded performance; it's as fast as the new Moto G4, but I wonder if there's anything here regular consumers would respond to.. 8:30PM: After a beer -- fine, a few beers -- the DTEK50 makes perfect sense. As a business move, it's a great idea: BlackBerry gets a new device on the market without spending loads of money on product development. It's also an appropriate follow-up to the Priv, if you think about it. BlackBerry's first Android phone dealt with some serious scrutiny from critics and security buffs alike, and for the most part, the company is pleased with how it all turned out. Now that it had a better sense of how the response to an Android-powered BlackBerry, the company was free to take that formula and apply it to a device that was meant to be sold in bulk -- to businesses, say, or governments. The DTEK50 is, as company spokespeople called it, a "fleet" device. If the DTEK50 finds a foothold with regular people, great! If not, so be it. As long as those corporations snap them up.. 11 PM: It's late, I'm tired and the DTEK50 is still hanging on -- 15 percent battery to go. And seriously, this thing is actually called the DTEK50? BlackBerry says it's meant partially to evoke the numbers used by BB10 devices -- the company topped out with the Z30 before switching back to proper names, so "50" was the next logical step. Still, it's straight-up gibberish without a nuanced understanding of BlackBerry's recent history.. I'm growing fonder of this thing, though, partially because it's a solid little phone but also because it's a symbol of John Chen's shrewdness. He's said countless times before that BlackBerry will bail out of the hardware business if it's not profitable, but dang it, the company just keeps trying anyway.. blackberry , dtek , dtek50 , gear , hands-on , mobile , preview , smartphone.

You wouldn’t put money in a bank that didn’t lock its safe, or leave the doors of your home unlocked at night. Having a smartphone that doesn’t take your privacy seriously is the equivalent.

The BlackBerry Convenience Key: With the press of a button, gain quick access to your most-used applications, tasks, and more.

How to disable an ad blocker on Business Insider. Tech Insider The affordabl.... The affordable new BlackBerry phone is safe in every sense of the word. Jeff Dunn , Business Insider US. The DTEK50 is a nice, utilitarian piece of hardware. It’s pleasingly thin (0.29 inches) and light (4.76 ounces), and it doesn’t feel loose. Its textured back is grippy, and its aluminum sides are cool and sturdy. Those materials, along with the gray-and-black look, come off a bit boring, but the whole thing is easy to hold. On the right side of the DTEK50 is a “convenience key,” which you can program to quick launch various apps. This isn’t a new idea, but being able to jump into your settings or email with the press of a button is, well, convenient. What isn’t here is a physical keyboard. Though BlackBerry says it’s not done with the old-school keys altogether, the DTEK50 suggests that it realizes most people don’t need one. Personally, I didn’t miss it — then again, I never relied on them in the first place. The big caveat is that nothing here is original. The DTEK50 is based on the same reference design Chinese firm TCL supplies for the Alcatel Idol 4, another recently-released Android phone. Aside from the material on the back, the two are virtually identical. It’s a 5.2-inch 1080p panel that has no problems with sharpness or viewing angles. It can also get very bright, making it readable outside. Its colors don’t “pop” the way they would on a good OLED display — like that of the Samsung Galaxy S7 — but they are accurate. For a $300 phone, it’s pleasant. Less pleasant is the DTEK50’s performance. The Snapdragon 617 chip here is the same one used in cheaper phones like the Moto G4: It’s good enough to get by, but never comfortably smooth or speedy. It doesn’t take much to heat up, either. The DTEK50’s 13-megapixel camera is similarly mediocre. It’s a familiar story for an affordable Android phone: okay in good conditions, sloppy at night. Even at its best, light tends to bleed in, and colors can look muted. You can get through a full day with the DTEK50’s 2,610 mAh pack, but it takes a little effort. If you spend all day on there, you’ll run out of juice faster than with most phones. So, why would you buy this again? Security. BlackBerry’s entire value proposition hinges on the idea that you care deeply about keeping your data private. Since the specs aren’t great, it’s assuming you’re willing to pay a premium for them. What you’re most likely to use is the DTEK app, which gives the phone its name. This breaks down the state of your device’s privacy into a simple checklist, topped by an overall grade. The rest of the software is a mostly clean take on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, peppered with various BlackBerry-made apps. There’s the Hub unified inbox, the predictive Keyboard, BlackBerry Messenger, and so on. These have their audiences, but they aren’t much more convenient than what Android offers by default, and none of them are uninstallable. The DTEK50 won’t “save” BlackBerry, and really, it’s not trying to. It’s just a competent, unsurprising mid-tier Android phone that focuses on the few advantages the company can still claim. If you don’t prioritize security, the DTEK50 won’t convert you. In fact, it borders on bad value. If you do, and you’re on a budget, it’s fine. Physical keyboards are a relic. People don’t talk about it anymore.. This, I imagine, is how you end up naming a phone the DTEK50 – you see the writing on the wall. And indeed, the Waterloo, Ontario company’s latest handset feels like it’s coming from a company that’s been stripped for parts.. This isn’t a moonshot like the Priv ; it’s an inoffensive and altogether safe stab at a certain sect of privacy-conscious users, most of whom would already consider BlackBerry in the first place.. At $300, though, it’s also affordable. That opens it up to a much larger potential audience than the $700 Priv ever could. Let’s see if it does enough to tap into that group.. You might initially mistake that key for a power button – that’s on the top left side here – but I got used to it without too much trouble.. The pic above shows the DTEK50 with the Idol 4’s bigger sibling, the Idol 4s, but you get the idea. This doesn’t make it any less usable, and it makes the DTEK50 less of a financial risk, but having that knowledge drives home just how unremarkable BlackBerry’s pitch is here.. As an aside: There’s no fingerprint scanner. That’s an odd omission for a device focused on security – especially since cheaper devices like the Moto G4 Plus include one – but there isn’t much you can do when you’re using somebody else’s stuff.. This is budget-level power at a mid-range price. It won’t stop you from checking your email or firing through apps, but there’s a persistent hint of choppiness regardless of what you’re doing. This is particularly iffy when it comes to gaming. For $200 – the Moto G4 and Idol 4’s going rate – it’d be fine. At $300, it’s a ways behind something like a Nexus 5X .. That the phone only has 16GB of storage by default is also underwhelming, but the included microSD slot negates that a bit.. On the plus side, the 8-megapixel shooter on its front is sharper than average for a phone this cheap.. It’s also worth noting the phone uses microUSB instead the newer USB-C. There is support for Qualcomm’s Quick Charge (2.0) standard, however, so it doesn’t take forever to refill the DTEK50 once it’s been used up.. That security focus comes in a few ways. On a fundamental level, BlackBerry says it’s equipped the device with full disk encryption, a hardware root of trust, a hardened Android kernel, and other measures that effectively mean “We made the phone less vulnerable.”. The company also promises to quickly and continually patch the device with regular security updates. It’s hard to see these things on a day-to-day basis, but they’re easy to appreciate.. Much of that list is obvious – simply setting a screen lock is one – but it makes it particularly easy to track and change what permissions you’ve allowed each app. It was eye-opening for me to see just how many apps quietly access my microphone or camera, for instance. Normally, I’d turn a blind eye to these things for fear of digging through settings menus. DTEK makes it legible and accessible.. Now, is all of this enough to make up for the issues above? For me, no. There’s also a certain level of paranoia you have to subscribe to see the appeal here. Regardless, I’ll take this over a wholesale reskinning of Android. Actually getting around the device isn’t that different than using a Nexus phone.. In other words, BlackBerry is playing to its enterprise-focused base. You’ll have a much easier time forgiving the DTEK50’s middling performance and battery life if you live in that sphere.. Head outside of it, though, and the DTEK50 becomes just another phone from just another company. After using it for the past week, I can’t really see it gaining much traction outside of the BlackBerry niche. It’ll do the job for a little while, and you’ll eventually forget it existed..

BlackBerry’s New DTEK50 and PRIV Are the Most Secure Android Devices on the Market: Here’s Why [VIDEO, PICS]. blog comments powered by Disqus. Four Reasons Why DTEK50 may be the Best Cameraphone You’ve Ever Owned. Five Features in DTEK50’s Custom Android UI that Let You Get Twice as Much Done for Half the Effort. DTEK50 by BlackBerry | Android | PRIV by BlackBerry | Security ›. BlackBerry’s New DTEK50 and PRIV Are the Most Secure Android Devices on the Market: Here’s Why [VIDEO, PICS]. 07.26.16 / Sonia Moniz Bennett. Device Security That’s Built in From the Start. Hardened Linux Kernel : We reduce the Android attack surface with numerous patches and configuration changes to improve security. Hardware Root of Trust : During manufacturing, we establish a Hardware Root of Trust that adds security keys to the processor on every DTEK50 and PRIV as it is built. Those keys track, verify, and provision each device – meaning that the authenticity and integrity of your device is guaranteed, as is the safety of the data it holds. A Better Bootloader : Because of our secure boot process, you can trust that only an untampered, BlackBerry-signed OS can be loaded. Each stage of the secure boot chain must first verify that the next component is fully intact before proceeding. FIPS 140-2 Compliant Full Disk Encryption: U.S. government-grade encryption protects your private information, like personal pictures or banking info, if your phone is lost or stolen. Continual and Fast Security Updates, Long After Your Purchase. Ongoing Security Patching : Many popular smartphones put the user’s private information at risk of being hacked due to slow security updates – weeks, months, or even years after a patch is released. BlackBerry’s record of being the quickest to deliver Android security patches minimizes your vulnerability. BlackBerry Integrity Detection (BID): We continuously monitor PRIV and DTEK50. for events or configuration changes that indicate a compromise to device security, then we trigger real-time actions if a threat is detected. Dedicated Security Research & Response Teams : We bring our world-renowned security experts and testing to our line of BlackBerry secure smartphones powered by Android. Total Control and Visibility of Your Privacy and Security. DTEK by BlackBerry: Our DTEK security application, installed on all PRIV and DTEK50 devices, automatically monitors your OS and apps and lets you know when your privacy could be at risk. With just a quick glimpse you can see the overall security rating for your device – excellent, fair, or poor – and what you can do to improve it. DTEK also tracks your applications and notifies you when someone is taking pictures or videos without your knowledge, turning your microphone on, sending a text message, or accessing your contacts or location. Our DTEK50 launch overview (with video);. DTEK50’s excellent ability as a camera ;. DTEK50’s sharp, smudge-proof (and secure) screen ;. In years past, security has been the Achilles’ heel of Android. Its status as the most popular mobile OS on the planet belies the malware, adware, hacks, and other threats that plague the platform. Don’t put the blame on Google – some carriers and device makers have been ridiculously slow to push software updates from Google that would patch the flaws.. There are good reasons behind Android’s popularity: Phone makers love Google’s Linux-based (read: open source) mobile operating system because they have more freedom to adapt it for their own brands and devices. Users love the variety of devices on the market, the openness of the platform, the integration with Google services, and the huge array of apps available in the Google Play store.. Still, many Android users have unwittingly traded their privacy and security away. Watch the video to hear what they say.. But BlackBerry knew it didn’t have to be that way.. When we decided to enter the Android market with PRIV last year, we knew the most important thing we could bring was our laser focus on privacy and security.

Announced on July 26, 2016, the DTEK50 is BlackBerry's second Android phone after the PRIV , and is "the world's most secure Android phone," according to the company.. The phone is actually built by TCL, the parent company of Alcatel, and is based around the design of the Alcatel Idol 4 , but features a number of BlackBerry-specific software improvements, including a hardened kernel and plenty of first-party apps. One of those apps, DTEK, is how the phone got its name: it is the lynchpin of the BlackBerry experience on Android, providing surety that the phone is secure from both physical and software-based intrusion.. The DTEK50 features a 5.2-inch 1080p LCD display with a 424ppi pixel density, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor paired with 3GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, expandable with microSD, a 2,610mAh battery, a 13MP rear camera with PDAF and f/2.0 lens, an 8MP selfie camera with a flash, all running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.

Security-focused smartphone confirms company's software-first ambitions. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The BlackBerry DTEK50's hardware is almost irrelevant, as the magic lies in the software.. Pleasing screen, camera provides good results, hardened security, price. Unremarkable design, so-so performance, confusing button placement, poor battery life. THE BLACKBERRY DTEK50 is the company's second Android smartphone, and, according to the firm, the most secure Android-powered device available today .. Our initial BlackBerry DTEK50 hands-on review poured scorn on the clunky name and, a couple of weeks on, our opinion hasn't changed. Sure, it's just a name, but this underpins a lot of what's wrong with BlackBerry's latest effort. Software lies at the core of the DTEK50 and that's also the handset's undoing.. Crucially the DTEK50 is a BlackBerry in name only, and if the firm's transition to becoming a software-only company wasn't already clear, this latest device confirms it.. Design We know it's something of a stereotype, but BlackBerry has always been synonymous. The company had an image all of its own and, as well as being a hit with enterprises for its hardened stance on security, released a clutch of great devices.. It is still is a trusted brand, but the allure is waning thanks in part to not putting out a handset worthy of its heritage for years. The last truly great BlackBerry was arguably the Bold 9700/9900 series, one of which dates back to 2009 and the most recent to 2011.. By our reckoning, the BlackBerry DTEK50 isn't likely to buck that trend. BlackBerry has taken what was already a fairly unremarkable handset, the Alcatel Idol 4, given it a textured rear, and then pumped it full of its own software.. The BlackBerry DTEK50 is impressively thin and light, which is no surprise considering the plastic and glass construction. It measures 147x73x7.4mm and weighs 135g, and is described as the thinnest BlackBerry ever. That might actually hold some weight if this was a bona fide BlackBerry and not a rebadged Alcatel Idol 4.. The textured rear feels good to hold despite being all plastic. We were half expecting a squidgy and somewhat rubbery finish but it's hardened instead, so not exactly the premium feel we'd have once expected from its creator. The dark grey anodised front and sides are broken up by a sliver of silver, which is a nice touch.. We stop and take notice when a phone gets the audio right. That's because it is so often overlooked, and we wouldn't have pegged the DTEK50 as the exception to this rule considering BlackBerry's track record in this area.. Suffice to say we were quietly blown away by the quality. It uses JBL's Waves MaxxAudio to great effect, and there's a pleasing thrum from the 3.6W speakers. You won't get the best experience straight out of the box, so turning off the Auto select mode and tweaking the levels is recommended.. There are dual front and rear speakers, and the BlackBerry DTEK50 doesn't blast the sound everywhere thanks to the phone's orientation sensors.. We'll cover BlackBerry's impressively accessible software suite in detail later, but it's a shame that the same effort hasn't been put into the phone's exterior. reverse just about everything any seasoned Android owner might be used to. For instance, the power button is on the left side, while the right has a volume rocker and a programmable 'Convenience Button'.. The Convenience Button is largely superfluous, and we often found ourselves instinctively reaching for it to wake the phone or to put it to sleep. Of course, it can be assigned to a favourite app or shortcut. The BlackBerry DTEK50 lacks a dedicated camera button, so this could serve as a sensible alternative.. The lack of fingerprint scanner on a device so obsessed with security also jars..

BlackBerry takes the full Android plunge with the DTEK50.

For all the speculation as to why BlackBerry has failed to keep up with the best. smartphones, one thing is certain – it should have done so, so much better. It’s too late for it to assume the throne once more, the throne it sat on back in the days when everyone from West Wing to Wall Street was bashing out emails on a BlackBerry Bold.. Also see: Best Black Friday Phone Deals. Now, after the company tried to change tact with the square BlackBerry Passport and the high-end Priv ,. it has released the BlackBerry DTEK50. It’s a mid-range (in terms of specs and price) Android handset with no physical keyboard and a penchant for security. Surely this is something the company should have done several years ago? Here’s our BlackBerry DTEK50 review.. The BlackBerry DTEK50 is available to order now direct from BlackBerry for £275 .. It's a good price, but if you're considering the DTEK50 because you want an Android smartphone for about £300, you can pick up the flagship OnePlus 3 for £329, or the similarly high-end Vodafone Smart Platinum 7 for £295.. The DTEK50 is quite plain looking, and bears a close resemblance to Alcatel’s Idol 4. This shows the design sacrifices BlackBerry has had to make, to the point of sharing designs with other manufacturers, to produce what is essentially a mid-range, stock Android smartphone. Having said that, the DTEK50 is good looking, if in a strictly business-like way.. It’s pleasant to use and hold, with metallic edges but it’s not quite heavy enough to have the. reassuring heft of flagship devices, and the back is a rubberised crosshatch. This stops the DTEK50 slipping out of your hand but it doesn’t scream high quality. The DTEK50 measures 147mm x 72.5mm x 7.4mm and weighs just 135g. With a 5.2in screen it’s right on the edge of easy one-handed use. If you’ve got smaller hands you’ll struggle still though.. It’s charged over microUSB, and a fast charger is supplied in the box, which is great to see because it works very well. Slightly confusingly, the power button is on the top left edge, while the silver button on the right edge where you’d expect it to be is a ‘convenience’ key. You can assign one of a number of uses to this button to launch an app or command of your choice. We used it to open the camera app, as there’s no camera button. The camera itself is 13Mp with single LED flash, while the front facing camera is a respectable 8Mp.. The right side edge of the DTEK50 also has a volume rocker, and there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top. Like we said, it’s not unattractive but there’s no escaping that this is not a very exciting phone to look at or to hold.. on the UK Tech Weekly podcast. Listen here from 15 minutes in:. Here's our round up of the best Android smartphones 2016 .. Things picked up a bit after our first impressions though when we turned the DTEK50 on. It’s a shame that the casing is a bit dull (it is a BlackBerry after all) because the specs are actually quite good. The DTEK50 has a 5.2in full HD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. Colour reproduction is solid, and videos display surprisingly well. The glass is supposedly scratch and smudge resistant, but the latter is impossible on smartphones at the moment. The speaker grills at the top and bottom of the screen are welcome; not only is the design subtle but it means that for video viewing you have two front facing speakers that are pleasingly decent. For those Netflix sessions you’ll still want headphones though.. With mid-range price comes mid-range processing power. The DTEK50 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 powering it, but in everyday use it actually zips along very nicely. For web viewing, social media, email and the like it is not noticeably slower than many flagship Android devices. Once you put it under some pressure (multiple app jumping, graphically intense gaming) then it starts sweating a bit, with occasional screen freezes and lag.. What is great to see, and probably helps with the speedy day-to-day performance, is 3GB RAM. This is more than the 2GB in Apple’s flagship iPhone 6s – this doesn’t mean the DTEK50 is as good at multitasking as that phone, but goes to show that if a manufacturer finely balances the processor and RAM specs it can achieve above average performance. So it is frustrating that our usual methods of benchmarking simply wouldn’t work on the DTEK50. Both Geekbench 3 and GFXBench refused to connect to their respective servers, so for now we can’t bring you any benchmarks. Although in average use the BlackBerry was good, you can be sure that it will fall behind flagship models in these sorts of tests.. We wondered if the DTEK50 is so secure it doesn't connect to what it considers unsecure servers. Hopefully this won't extend to stopping consumers doing simple tasks in daily use, though we didn't encounter any more stumbling blocks like this.. You might see a pattern emerging here, with the cameras on the DTEK50 firmly in the mid-range. A rear facing 13Mp camera takes great close up images but tends to struggle with detail in wider-angle shots. Take a look at the example photos here for an idea of the quality. The front-facing 8Mp camera can cope with Skype calls but it isn’t one to go for if you’ve got a strong selfie game – pictures are just too grainy.. The DTEK50 is pleasingly strong in terms of battery life. 2610mAh non-removable battery that teams up well with the bundled fast charger. After taking the device off charge at 8am, it lasted a whole working day with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on, receiving push notifications from several apps. Come 11pm it was on about 15%, which represents good stamina.. The DTEK50 runs near to stock Android Marshmallow 6.0.1. It’s a pleasure to use, as ever. One thing to avoid is the BlackBerry Intelligent Keyboard – an onscreen monstrosity that tries to make typing easier with pop up predictions. Google Keyboard is infinitely better, so make sure you use it instead. It improves the experience of using the device no end.. Where BlackBerry is trying to differentiate the DTEK50 is in its concentration on the privacy and security of the device and its user. The marketing for the phone even calls it ‘the world’s most secure Android smartphone’. This is a bold claim given the Android operating system’s open nature. What’s more, BlackBerry doesn’t really, properly explain quite what it’s done to the DTEK50 to make it so secure.. Aside from the claims that BBM is super-encrypted (so is WhatsApp), all the DTEK app actually does is make you aware of potential security flaws and then prompts you to do something about it. It won’t stop you sending your credit card details to a spam email, for instance (then again that's pretty much impossible). Instead the DTEK app gives you an overview of your device set up and points out where you might be vulnerable.. As you can see from this screenshot, we purposefully didn’t set up a PIN code to unlock the phone – the phone dutifully lets you know this is bad.. It’s good that the app shows you how to fix the problem and gives you menu links straight to where to do it, but we couldn’t help but feel the marketing is a tad misleading by claiming the DTEK50 is the world’s most secure smartphone. Anyone with a bit of know-how will already have set up any other Android smartphone to be just as secure.. What’s more useful is the ability to granularly monitor and change the permissions third party apps have. If you’re worried about an app accessing your microphone, for instance, you can set DTEK to notify you when it does so. Or, you can stop it doing so altogether. This is more useful and pleasingly discreet if you don’t want to use them. The company also claims it will deliver the DTEK50 Android security patches faster than any other handset, aiding security.. all amounts to one question about the DTEK50. – who is this phone for? Businesses may welcome the Android BlackBerry if they are reluctant to let go of the older BlackBerry models, but in reality they will probably just buy in a ton of iPhones.. 5.2in 1920 x 1080 full HD touchscreen, 424ppi. 16GB storage, microSD up to 256GB. 13Mp main camera, single LED flash. 147 x 72.5 x 7.4 mm. 5.2in 1920 x 1080 full HD touchscreen, 424ppi. 16GB storage, microSD up to 256GB. 13Mp main camera, single LED flash. 147 x 72.5 x 7.4 mm. The BlackBerry DTEK50 is a good phone. But we can’t fully recommend it because of the way BlackBerry is marketing it. The perhaps incorrect status quo is that people don’t want to worry about security; they just want a phone that works. Security flaws on huge scales are largely down to external database hacks, not device vulnerabilities. The DTEK50 is a good phone at a good price, but it isn’t different enough to drag BlackBerry back into smartphone relevance.. Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices.
