Subject Comments. 
In a short time, Lenovo has emerged as a force to reckon within the affordable smartphone market in India. The latest one from the company, the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus packs in quite a punch for a budget smartphone and doesn't look bad, but you'd have to make a few trade-offs here and there. You'd be inclined to, because the price is just right.. The budget segment in India is crowded, and a decent package just doesn't cut it. I spent a couple of weeks with the Vibe K5 Plus reviewing the smartphone, while simultaneously using a Huawei Honor 5X, a Redmi Note 3, and a LeEco Le 1S (yes, it's insane!) to put my experience in perspective.. Back panel is prone to scratches. Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus specifications. Android 5.1 Lollipop with Vibe UI. 5-inch Full HD (1080 x 1920) IPS LCD. Qualcomm Octa core Snapdragon 616 | Quad core 1.5 GHz + Quad core 1.2 GHz. 16GB internal memory, expandable up to 32GB via microSD card. 142 x 71 x 7.9 mm. I used the Indian retail variant of the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus that ran Vibe UI running on top of Android 5.1 out of the box. For most of the time, I used it with an Airtel 4G SIM in Delhi NCR. Out of the 16GB internal storage, a little over 10GB was available out of the box. During my usage, there was an OTA update too for performance improvements.. Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus design. At first glance, the Vibe K5 Plus looks okay for a budget device. The built is sturdy, but it won't win any design contest. The K5 Plus does away with the all-plastic build of A6000/A6000 Plus, and goes for a hybrid design. The removable back panel features an aluminum plate in the middle flanked by two plastic strips. It's flimsy, and is prone to scratches.. Yet the phone is compact, and feels great in the hand, not once slipping out. The navigation keys at front are unfortunately not backlit, and you might fumble once in a while in dark.. The neatest touch on the Vibe K5 Plus is the twin speaker grilles at the back with the Dolby logo. Big props to Lenovo for including stereo speakers in a budget device.. Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus display. The K5 plus sports a 5-inch Full HD IPS display which is pretty good for its price. I would've been contended with 720p display, but a 1080p display with 441ppi for a budget device is impressive.. It's sharp and vivid, and also offers great viewing angles. The text is sharp and the images are crisp. The colors are a bit dull and the accuracy too is only middling, especially when looked at an angle. The brightness and contrast is at par or better than most sub-₹10,000 smartphones in the market, although if you have a good eye, you'd rate Redmi Note 3's display better. The K5 Plus though has better color accuracy.. There's no Gorilla Glass protection but that's understandable for a budget device. For a budget LCD panel, the Vibe K5 Plus also does good enough in bright sunlight.. Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus hardware. Powered by a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus does well on the specifications sheet for a budget device. The performance though is middling, and once you've got a few apps on and are multitasking in real-life usage, a few lags start creeping in.. Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus battery life. Yet, the Vibe K5 Plus chugs along well for graphic-intensive gaming titles, although it does heat up within minutes. It doesn't get uncomfortably hot, but is annoying since it happens not just while gaming, but even while watching a local video or streamed from the Web.. The Vibe K5 Plus also misses out on nifty extras like a fingerprint reader or an IR blaster. Several other low-cost smartphones do offer these features, so Lenovo is betting big on its overall package to steer clear of these. Of course, it supports Lenovo's AntVR headset for an immersive media experience via TheatreMax technology.. One of the lesser appreciated highlights of the Vibe K5 Plus is the Dolby audio enhancement. The Dolby Atmos speakers offer crisp, clear sound and the twin speakers really do make a difference. The audio quality is brilliant – better than even several higher-priced smartphones.. In the age of unibody smartphones, the Vibe K5 Plus sports a modest 2750 mAh removable battery. As the battery life turns out, you'd thank Lenovo for the swappable battery. I started the day with full battery, and a few social apps and email on 4G had me going to about 15 percent battery by the afternoon.. While the battery life is just about okay for a light user, even on a moderate usage, you'd have to reach for the charger before end of the day. It's pretty inexcusable even for a budget device. The charging too is pretty slow which is a bummer considering the battery life.. The Vibe K5 Plus is no marathon runner, although it does well for the moderately sized battery it packs. Several smartphones with a bigger battery don't go significantly longer. However, if you play games and watch a lot of videos on the move, the Vibe K5 Plus is not for you.. Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus software. The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus runs the company's proprietary Vibe UI on top of Android Lollipop 5.1.1. Interestingly, the budget device doesn't come with the revamped Vibe UI that shipped with the Lenovo Vibe X3 earlier this year. While Lenovo smartphones have found a lot of takers, I'm yet to meet a Vibe UI fan and it's no different with the Vibe K5 Plus. It works, and that's about it.. The phone comes with the usual Lenovo software additions. There's the Lenovo Companion app which lets you check for software updates and perform system tests, as well as the familiar SHAREit and SYNCit for transferring files and backing up data respectively. There's a limited Theme Center too with a tacky collection of themes and wallpapers.. Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus camera. The Vibe K5 Plus comes with a lot of bundled apps like Game Store, Twitter, Skype, WeChat, UC Browser, Flipkart, Myntra, Evernote, McAfee Security, and Truecaller, but thankfully these all can be uninstalled if you are not interested. Still, the amount of out of the box bloatware on a device with limited hardware is awkward.. The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus is equipped with a 13MP primary camera with f/2.2 aperture and LED flash, as well as a 5MP front shooter. The front camera is okay for this price segment and allows you to click decent selfies in outdoor lighting, although only manages noisy shots indoors.. The rear camera is decent too for a budget device. For close-up shots and when the subject is right in front of lens, the photo quality is pretty good with plenty of details. Landscape shots are inconsistent though, and low light shots turn out to be quite dark and grainy.. The camera app is standard UI fare, and apart from the HDR and Panorama mode, there is range of filters you can apply to your photos in real time.. Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus The bottom line. The Vibe K5 Plus wouldn't shatter any sales records, but makes for a good enough, compact device that won't break the bank. It sports Full HD display, brilliant audio output, and a decent camera, but middling performance and a terrible battery life lets you down.. Should you buy it? Probably. All budget smartphones require you to compromise on one thing or the other, and you'd have a to make a few for the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus. At a price of ₹8,499 ($127) in India, the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus is a decent buy. It could, no, it should've been better because it sits between very capable entry-level budget phones and phones with better specifications that you can get by spending just a little more dough..

Jamshed Avari , 04 April 2016. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Just a few short months after launching the impressive Vibe K4 Note ( Review | Pictures ) Lenovo has unveiled another low-cost phone called the Vibe K5 Plus. The new model, which launched in India before any other country , does not replace the popular K4 Note. In fact, priced at just Rs. 8,499, the K5 Plus is below the K4 Note in Lenovo's hierarchy. This awkwardness is apparently due to internal reshuffling as the company gears up to integrate Motorola's popular mid-budget offerings into its lineup .. Naming aside, it's pretty clear where the new model's aspirations lie. There are a lot of great phones to be had for Rs. 10,000 or less today, and Lenovo wants in on that action. In that sense, the K5 Plus is more of an update to the extremely popular K3 Note ( Review | Pictures ), bringing a more premium look to an even lower price point.. Look and feel The Vibe K5 Plus looks great for a low-cost phone. We received a silver unit for review, but this phone is also available in gold and grey. There's a front camera and sensor window above the screen, and capacitive navigation buttons below. These buttons are sadly not backlit so you might wind up fumbling a bit in the dark. There isn't much wasted space to the sides of the screen, which makes this phone pretty easy to use with one hand.. The rear and sides are formed into a single shell that pops off with relatively little effort. It might look like there are strips of plastic on the top and bottom with metal in the middle, but it's only a thin plate over an all-plastic structural frame. Still, it feels cool to the touch, which is part of its premium feel.. The camera is in one corner, with a single LED flash next to it. More interesting are the twin speaker grilles and Dolby logo lower down - stereo speakers are rare on phones in general, let alone budget ones. The 3.5mm audio socket and Micro-USB port are both on the top, and the power and volume buttons are on the right, leaving the bottom and left blank.. The battery is removable, and you'll have to pop it out in order to get to the two Micro-SIM slots and the microSD slot. You get a 1.5A charger, USB cable, and adhesive screen protector in the box, but no headset.. Specifications and software The Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus has a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 processor running the show. There's 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage along with LTE support on either SIM. The battery has a capacity of 2750mAh and all the usual standards, including Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi b/g/n, AGPS, and USB-OTG are present and accounted for.. The display measures 5 inches diagonally and has a resolution of 1080x1920 which pretty good for this price range. The phone also supports Lenovo's AntVR headset for immersive media experiences. The rear camera has a 13 megapixel sensor and the front camera has a 5 megapixel sensor. Video recording goes up to 1080p. There's also Dolby audio enhancement, as the logo on the back suggests.. Other than that, there are no extras such as a fingerprint reader or IR emitter. Other low-cost phones do offer these as unique selling points, and it seems that Lenovo is going with the metallic body as the Vibe K5 Plus's main advantage.. Lenovo has decided not to give budget segment buyers all the benefits of the revamped Vibe UI that shipped with the premium Vibe X3 earlier this year. There's no dedicated app drawer or even an option to switch one on. The base OS is Android 5.1.1 but yet again, we see a manufacturer overriding the standard Android Recents button and turning it into a useless Menu button on a low-end phone.. There's a Lenovo Companion app which lets you check for software updates and perform basic subsystem tests, as well as the familiar SHAREit and SYNCit for transferring files and backing up data respectively. Theme Center offers six options and a variety of wallpaper images, but nothing close to stock Android which we would have liked. You also get an assortment of apps including Game Store, Twitter, Skype, WeChat, UC Browser, Flipkart, Myntra, Evernote, and Truecaller, which are thankfully all removable.. Performance We found the Vibe K5 Plus a pleasant phone to use, on the whole. The screen is sharp and bright, though colours are just a tiny bit dull. Audio, on the other hand, is loud and clear. The twin speakers really do make a difference - we only wish they had been pointing forward. The Dolby Atmos controls do make a difference, but only in supported apps. Our biggest complaint with this phone was that its upper back got quite hot when doing relatively simple things such as streaming YouTube videos.. Benchmark tests showed that performance is on par with other budget phones. We recorded scores of 35,727 in AnTuTu and 20,227 overall in Quadrant. 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme gave us 5,596 points and GFXbench ran at 12fps. Curiously though, these scores are overall lower than what the Lenovo K3 Note managed.. Photo quality was mostly okay - there's a bit of grain on anything that isn't right in front of the lens, and only close-up shots are really good. Focusing was an issue in all kinds of light - we had to hold very steady when taking shots or the results would be unpredictable. However, most of these things aren't really problems unless you're zooming in to photos at full size. You get a small number of filters, but not much else. Video was smooth at 1080p, but we did notice the phone heating up again when recording, There's also a 30-minute hard limit on video length, which we found unnecessary.. Battery life seemed just about okay in day-to-day use, with the phone making it through the day if usage was relatively light. Our video loop test went on for 6 hours, 46 minutes, which is below average. The phone seemed to last well when in standby, but on the other hand, charging was pretty slow.. Verdict It seems that Lenovo has the makings of another winner on its hands. It could be as popular as the K3 Note was, bringing similar features and even better looks to a lower price level. The only real objections we have with this phone are its weak battery life and tendency to become uncomfortably warm when anything serious is running.. In terms of performance, the Vibe K5 Plus edges out the more expensive Honor 5X ( Review | Pictures ) and seems like a better deal that similarly priced phones such as the Karbonn Quattro L50 HD ( Review | Pictures ). However, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 ( Review | Pictures ) is just one step up in terms of pricing, and you might be a lot happier spending just a little more..

Тhe Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus, which aims to go easy on your wallet, seems to be audio-centric devices with Dolby Atmos support and two speakers on board. The phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 SOC, 2 gigs of RAM and 16GB native storage. There is 13MP camera on the back, as well as 5MP front snapper. Dimensions: 5.59 x 2.80 x 0.32 inches (142 x 71 x 8.2 mm). Weight: 5.01 oz (142 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor.

Esto también se puede leer en español.. Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus shows just how little a decent smartphone costs these days. For just $149, the Lenovo K5 Plus and its slightly cheaper sibling the K5 boast a list of specs that would have cost you a bundle just a couple of years ago.. by February 21, 2016 10:00 AM PST. Lenovo Vibe 5K and 5K Plus give us value vibes (pictures). We're getting a value vibe from the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus. Key specs 5-inch screen Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor 8.2mm thick Weighs 142 grams 16GB built-in memory 2,750mAh user-replaceable battery 13-megapixel rear camera with autofocus and LED flash 5-megapixel fixed-focus front camera Dual SIM. It seems like only five minutes ago that a 4G LTE phone with a high definition screen and an eight-core processor was a top-of-the-line model that would set you back a small fortune. But the phone world has moved on and now you can get all that for just $149, in the shape of the new Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus.. The Vibe K5 Plus and its slightly cheaper sibling the K5 will be on sale in emerging markets, so you won't be able to buy it in the US or most of Europe. And while $149 (directly converted, that's around £100 or AU$210) sounds pretty wallet-friendly in western markets, it might be less affordable in Asia, India or South America. But if you do have the cash, the K5 and K5 Plus look like solid Android all-rounders.. Both phones have octa-core Qualcomm processors running Android 5.1 Lollipop software, with a fairly light Lenovo skin on top. The K5 Plus boasts a Snapdragon 616 chip and full high definition 1080p screen, while the K5 knocks off $20 with a Snapdragon 415 chip and 720p screen, taking the price to $129 (roughly £90 or AU$180).. The differences are all on the inside. The two phones are identical from the outside, clad in silver, grey or champagne gold metal. That does make the K5 pair look an awful lot like an iPhone. OK, you can argue that all phones look basically the same -- and someone probably will in the comments -- but with its chrome band round the edge, horizontal speaker at the top and the horizontal lines across the back the K5 looks almost like it wants to be mistaken for Apple's baby.. Lenovo Vibe 5K and 5K Plus give us value vibes (pictures). The K5 siblings have a few advantages over the iPhone, however. The back comes off so you can swap out the battery, for a start, and while the battery is out you can add a 32GB memory card to top up the built-in 16GB storage. On top of that, it's dual-SIM, so you can have two SIM cards and two numbers in one phone. One could be for business and one for personal calls, for example, or one could be for your other half and one for your bit on the side.. Another bonus feature is Dolby Atmos surround sound, which sends the nuances of the sound from your movies and music moving from ear to ear. This works with any headphones .. It's worth noting that different regions will have different apps -- for example, if you buy it in China you won't have access to the Google Play store to download official Android apps..

The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time 32.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Talk time (3G) 15.10 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (4G) 13.4 days (322 hours) the average is 23 days (549 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus User Reviews. BASED ON 45,437 RATING(S). 27 Mar 2016 By siddhartha tewary On flipkart.com. camera is averagenlokss is owsomen but it not the worth money product. lots of heating when using phone and battery is so poor. 02 Apr 2016 By Bhagabati Pr. The specification is good, but it heats up immediately even after 2 video plays on YouTube. I asked fro return and Flipkart rejected the request saying 38 degree battery temperature is OK and they don't think it's hot enough for a return. Apparently phone has a aluminum case and the battery/internal heat get transmitted immediately to outside and makes the phone very hot and you have to literally put it down on a table or sofa and use it! nnIt's just a mockery all about easy returns and ads on TV. Probably this is my last purchase from Flipkart and a very setback for online shoppers.. Lenovo VIBE K5 Plus variant with 3GB RAM and new UI launched for Rs 8,499. Aug 01 2016 By Akshay Kumar.

Please ask the question in above box. What is the difference between 2 GB RAM or 3 GB Ram?. The difference between the 2GB and 3GB is all about how you keep all the apps running in the background which you have opened. More the RAM more the performance-oriented phone but it is not true in every case. Some mobiles also perform well because of their software and UI (user-interface). An iPhone with a 1GB RAM can easily beat an Android device. My suggestion is, if you are a normal Android user then you go for 2GB RAM or else if you are a hardcore gamer or you load your phone with lots of apps then go for 3GB or more.. GB is Giga Byte, unit of memory. RAM is Random Access Memory i.e., memory required at the time of execution of any process. With less RAM, in multi processing i.e., performing more than one process at a time like downloading a video, same time checking SMS, etc., will be slow. Also some apps require huge memory to execute. With more RAM, the execution will be faster.. You may go with 2 GB RAM, if you are going to use the mobile only for call purpose or for surfing internet like social media. If you are going to use it for gaming purpose, editing or livestreaming, then you must go with 3 GB RAM.. The performance of the phone is good, and you can install some big games and apps in 3GB RAM which can't be installed in 2GB RAM.. If RAM is more then mobile works faster. 3 GB RAM mobile works faster than 2GB RAM mobile. What do you mean, you can make a call with your SIM. Internet is required for making video calls and internet enabled calls like through Whats App and Messenger etc.. Yes, with new update the device is HD capable. But video calls are not allowed.. Yes, we can call without Internet.. Is this a 4G phone? How is the battery backup of this phone and does it have dual sim option?. It has dual SIM slots and dedicated microSD slot and sim 1 alone has 4G. Battery backup is good but not great it does not last long on gaming and videos. Battery backup is ok and lasts upto 4.5hrs. It supports dual SIM and a memory card.. Average battery backup, up to 1 day.. Yes, it has the dual SIM option.. Yes, you can use dual 4G sim, and it's battery backup is around 2 days in normal use.. Yes, it has dual SIM and is a 4G mobile. The battery backup is ok, I think.. Is there any heating problem with this device?. A lot, you can't even hold it. Definitely, you will need a case and leave the phone open i.e. remove back cover so that temperature reduces whenever possible or it might deplete battery and processor.. Every mobile during heavy usage it'll create heat except aluminum covers .. When it's new, it will heat upto 6 months this is not a problem.. Getting heated after continuous use of half an hour.. Yes, in case of low internet speed.. What type of battery it has?. I guess it is 2850 mAh lithium polymer battery. Please go for Vibe K5 note. It is much better than K5 plus. It has 3500 mAh battery, with no lags, upgradeable OS and a better processor.. fully charged Battery reaches 15~20% in 24 ~25 hours with 3G/4G on for all throughout and using normal talktime.. I am using this phone since December and as of today, it lasts for one and a half days with normal usage.. Removable but in less than 1 month it is not working.. It has a removable battery with 2750mah. User Reviews of Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus. 7 Ratings 5 Reviews. 5 2. 4 0. 3 5. 2 0. 1 0. Rate & review this product and help other customers.

You really need to rollout bug free update for VIBE K5.. Internet connection drop in any network,. Heating Issue (let me clear, all users and other moble owner keeps the backround apps on, why can't We). No double tap option (seems using prior version of andorid). Google launcher always get delselected once restarted (why I can't be with another launcher If I not like VIBE Launcher). No adjusment optinos for long press key for home button (to make swipe between apps, or to make any other use). some more are there which is not getting reminded, thus requesting you to kindly release the new software update before phone expires..
