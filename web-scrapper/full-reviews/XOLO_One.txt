more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 8 GB + MicroSD. Too little RAM memory (1 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (218 ppi). The Xolo One is a low-end smartphone. Running on Android 5.0, it features a 4.5" display, 1.3 GHz dual core processor, 1 GB RAM, 8 GB storage, microSD slot, 5 MP rear shooter and VGA front camera.. Dimensions: 5.04 x 2.53 x 0.37 inches (128 x 64.3 x 9.3 mm). Resolution: 480 x 854 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Smile detection, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 19.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 17.9 days (430 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 8.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 15.7 days (377 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Data: HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Updated On: 26th February 2018. 3.6 123 Ratings 0 Questions & Answers. Xolo One is a dual-SIM device that runs Android 4.4 KitKat. The device has a 4.5-inch IPS OGS display with a pixel density of 218 PPI. It comes with a 5MP rear camera with LED flash and a VGA front camera. The phone is powered by a 1.3GHz quad-core Mediatek processor and 1GB RAM. It has 8GB internal storage which can be expanded up to 32GB via microSD card. Connectivity options include 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and microUSB 2.0. The device is powered by a Li-Ion 1700mAh battery .. Best Price: ₹ 10,299. Key Specifications 1GB RAM 8GB internal storage 1700 mAh battery 5 M.Pixels rear & 0.3 M.Pixels selfie 4.5 inch screen Dual SIM (Micro SIM) Android OS, v4.4 (KitKat). Xolo One Price starts at Rs. The lowest price of Xolo One is at Amazon. One is not available in other online stores. This phone is available in 8 GB, 16 GB storage variants.. It is not hard to see the segment Xolo is targeting with the Xolo One. Micromax, Spice and Karbonn got on-board the Android One bandwagon, and it looks like the One is Xolo s answer. In terms of the hardware, the Xolo One doesn t differ much from what is being offered with Android One, but the advantage lies in the fact that the device is being sold for lesser than what the Canvas A1 and others currently command.. Coming to the hardware, Xolo One comes with a 4.5-inch display with a resolution of 854 x 480, same as that of Android One handsets. Under the hood, there s a 1.3GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6582M CPU, and in terms of memory you get 1GB RAM and 8GB internal memory, along with a microSD card slot that allows you to extend memory by an additional 32GB.. One point of differentiation with Android One is the capacitive buttons at the bottom of the device. Google has been advocating on-screen buttons for a while now, but most manufacturers including Samsung are unwilling to move away from physical buttons. For what it s worth, there aren t any issues with the buttons on the Xolo One.. Other hardware on the device includes a 5MP camera at the back with LED flash, VGA shooter, 3G connectivity , Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and a 1,700mAh battery. Another point that distinguishes the Xolo One is its faux-leather back cover, which gives the design a more premium look. The device is also available in a multitude of color variants, including red, brown, white and black. Software-wise, the handset runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat, and is scheduled to make the switch to Android 5.0.. There s a lot of contention in this segment. On the one hand, we have the Android One initiative, with the three devices currently on sale offering decent hardware. Then there s the Chinese contingent, through which you get better hardware, but a heavily tweaked user interface that s not bound to be as lightweight as what s available with local vendors..

It has a powerful 1.3GHz quad core Mediatek processor, which is best at this price. Processor makes it fast and responsive. It has 1GB RAM which is enough, your phone would not hang and you can play heavy games like Dead Trigger 2 or Asphalt 8. It also has Mali-400MP2 GPU, so it's more better. It has only 8GB ROM which is the best in t his price range and you can store your apps in it. This can be again expanded up to 32GB, so no complaints. It has a 5MP autofocus rear camera with flash and front VGA (0.3MP) camera for video calling. It has a 4.5 inch IPS display with 218 ppi density. It is capacitive and touch response is good. 256K colors (sharpness would be better). It runs Android 4.4.2 Kitkat out of the box but it is upgradable to Android 5.0 Lollipop. It only has few sensors on board namely accelerometer and proximity sensor (It also has G-sensor). Connectivity options like 3G, bluetooth and wifi are present. It's at a lower price online. It has a 1700 mAh battery, which should last up to 1 day with light use and some hours with heavy use. Playing games, listening music, using whatsapp, facebook, seeing movie, etc. I prefer this smartphone and it's really very nice. I give 9/10 (for sensors, battery and some other reasons).

BASED ON 544 RATING(S). 17 Nov 2014 By Sanjeev Kumar On flipkart.com. A perfect phone for budget lovers.. I bought this phone as a gift for my dad. He was using Nokia Asha earlier and was struggling with the screen size and usability. I planned to buy a phone but with some conditions.nn1) Screen should not be too big, so that it fits in pocket comfortably.n2) Phone should not be bulky, so handling will be easier.n3) Price should not go more than 7K.n4) No Karbonn or micromax or chinese mobiles as he had a bad experience with these mobiles.nnWith these conditions in our mind, we decided on these mobiles.nn1) Xiomi Redmin2) Lava mobilesn3) Xolo mobiles.n4) Moto Ennsince he doesn't want china mobile, we ruled out Redmi. Moto E was bulky for him so ruled out that too.nWhen we went for Lava mobiles we dint get a suitable or convincing mobile in our price and when we looked for solo, we saw Android one mobile available there.nnSince android one promises upgrade for minimum 2years, we finalised on Xolo one and we bought it on a experimental basis.nnWhen we received the phone, my dad was very happy with its thin profile and the performance. nnXolo one is too good for him. Wifi is excellent in device and its very fast.nnWe are still checking out the battery backup and display in broad day light etc. nWill update once we come up with something.. :)nnPS: In the initial usage, we found it super cool and i added this device in my recommendation list for my friends.nnI have a Nexus 5, iPhone 5s and Moto g2 in my family.. 17 Nov 2014 By Pankaj Gupta On flipkart.com. if not best then better than the rest!.

No Expert reviews found for this mobile.. Overall a nyc phone except in battery backup and sound quality... Nice performance but battery drains fastly and sound qualiy is not satisfactory and it is below avg.. Smooth touch Performance Gaming Look stylish Not hangs too much but a bit Video quality super. Earphones are good 2 sims supports 3g. Battery draining is highest disadvantage of this mobile. Sound quality not nyc Little heating on too much work. Its Better Than Android One phones. Except for the camera, each n every feature of the phone is very nice.. Thats not to say that camera is bad, but it lacks autofocus yet its camera response is very fast when compared to android one phones. Decent camera with fast photo capture decent battery back up very good vivid screen. apps can be downloaded to sd card directly and also can be moved from internal storage. Very compact design when compared to android one 8 gb internal storage(1.97 for apps + 4.07 gb for media + rest used by system) Most Important - Android L update soon. Front VGA camera screen resolution could have been better though even this is not pixelating Overall i would say one of the best choices available in the market at this price point.

Freeware Squad- Home of Freeware Daily Dose of Freewares. Home » Mobile Phones » XOLO One Review. Reviews Xolo One 2014-11-17. in Mobile Phones , Reviews. When Google launched the Android One platform with few Indian OEMs including Micromax, Karbonn and Spice, XOLO couldn’t get on-board. But XOLO has made sure that there is a good device to compete the Android One Platform by launching the XOLO One. The XOLO One has similar specs as that of Android One phones and comes with 4.5inch FWVGA display and is powered by 1.3Ghz Quad Core MediaTek processor with 1GB RAM. The phone supports dual SIM and comes with 8GB internal storage which is expandable.. The device runs on Android 4.4 KitKat, but is upgradable to Android Lollipop. It also comes with a 5MP rear camera and a VGA front camera. Here is the detailed review of the device and we check out whether this device is a better buy than the Android One phones.. Related Reading: XOLO One Unboxing. Here is the video review of the device.. One thing striking about the XOLO One is the design. Unlike the normal budget or low end devices with uninspiring design and quality, the XOLO One stands out with a unique slim design and great finishing. The device is designed such a way that bezels are made small and you get a feeling that the device is pretty small even though it has a the same display size of Canvas A1 and ASUS Zenfone 4 (A450CG).. The device comes with power button on the right side and volume keys on the left. The micro USB charging slot and the 3.5mm audio jack sits on the top. The rear panel has the 5MP fixed focus camera with LED flash. The rear cover has a leather finish giving good grip on the device. It also gives a premium feel.. The front panel has the 4.5inch FWVGA display and three capacitive touch buttons at the bottom. There is also a front facing VGA camera on the top. Overall, we were impressed with the design and build quality of the device.. The device comes with a 4.5inch FWVGA IPS display which has a pixel density of 218 PPI. While the resolution of the display is pretty low, it doesn’t really look like one. The display is pretty vibrant and has good colors and gives a good feel while using it. One of the main issues with the low end devices is that the display feels dull, but not the case with XOLO One.. The viewing angles are also pretty decent and so is the sunlight readability. The phone also comes with ambient light sensor. The touch response of the display is fairly good although at times when pulling the notification center, you have to pull it twice.. XOLO One runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat and is meant to compete with Android One platform, which means it will get the latest update. XOLO has promised that the XOLO One will get the Android Lollipop or Android 5.0 update, but there is no mention on the time frame. The software on the phone is more or less like stock UI with very little customization. The phone has two different types of launcher, one with the looks of KitKat and one with the UI of Jelly Bean.. The notification center has the same set of options you would see on a device powered by MediaTek processor.. There isn’t any customizations in the device and the phone feels pretty fast. Powering the device is MediaTek 6582M. 1.3 GHz Quad Core processor with 1GB RAM. The performance is pretty good and we didn’t see any sort of lag while using it. Multitasking was also fine on the device. The gaming experience although was not the best, it was better than Micromax Canvas A1 as the display was more vibrant.. The phone comes with 8GB internal storage out of which internal storage makes up for 1.97GB while phone storage comes to around 4.07GB. This is one good advantage of the device as most of the Android One offering gives only 4GB storage. The storage is expandable via microSD card.. The call quality on the device is pretty decent and we didn’t have any issues with dropped calls or signal strength. The speaker quality is just average and there are other devices with better audio output. The phone comes with dual SIM card support and has dedicated section to manage the SIM cards. XOLO has added two useful apps- Xolo Power and Xolo secure.. Xolo Power helps you get the better out of the battery with different modes and the secure app protects your phone by backing up data to the cloud.. The phone comes with 5MP rear camera with fixed focus and LED flash. There is also a VGA front facing camera. The camera is the weakest aspect of the phone. Although many of the entry level phones have only 5MP camera, devices like Redmi 1S, Honor Holly have better camera and now it is really difficult to sell a phone with a fixed focus camera.. The photos taken using the phone looks washed out and colors are out of sync. With the fixed focus, macro shots are totally out of focus and they are blurred. The low light and night photos are also not impressive. The interface of the phone camera is similar to any other phone with a MediaTek processor and has good set of options. It can record videos in 1080P, but the quality is again not impressive. If you are looking for an entry level phone with decent camera, you should be skipping this one.. Here are some of the samples from the 5MP fixed focus camera.. The phone comes with 1700mAh battery which is similar to any other entry level phone in terms of capacity. With average usage which includes few calls, SMS, browsing, casual gaming and also using social networking apps, you should be able to get a day of usage. Along with this the XOLO Power app should help you get a better battery life from the device.. Priced at Rs 6599/- MRP, the phone is a decent competitor to Android One devices. While XOLO One excels in design and build, the camera is one of the weakest links on the phone. If you are not worried about the camera, XOLO One is a decent buy with good performance and guaranteed Android Lollipop update.. When Google launched the Android One platform with few Indian OEMs including Micromax, Karbonn and Spice, XOLO couldn’t get on-board. But XOLO has made sure that there is a good device to compete the Android One Platform by launching the XOLO One. The XOLO One has similar specs as that of Android One phones and ….
