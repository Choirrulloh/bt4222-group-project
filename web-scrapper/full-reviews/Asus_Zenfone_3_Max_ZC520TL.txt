Is there a possibility to downgrade the phone? Your answers is highly appreciated.. heyy thats good, still are u using this pone?. Ron, 23 Jul 2017 Good guys! Just want to ask if the android version of this model is upgradable into Nougat? Better dont upgrade to nougat. screen capacitive button so it can look like flagship phone. nice 4G and fast one but wifi average speed often drops. often slow procesor and huge ram usage. must shot 5 times and blurry image still compare to my samsung a5 2015. better without front logo just black gloss front. im using it 6 months already and better choose phone with snapdragon one and 13MP with f 2.0 / bigger 16MP. u can choose redmi 5 / 5plus instead this phone.. can't believe i bought this phone! its very slow. hi..i used this phone for several month, now i have notification reverse charging...i already factory reset but this message always pop up reverse charging...anyone can help me ?. Anonymous, 02 Dec 2017 can this phone play 2k17? yes. My son has had this phone for 1 year & always works perfectly. I have the ZC553KL for 9 months & that is perfect too. Both seem excellent phones with really good features & we've been very happy with them. Sorry you guys have had problems, just bad luck I guess.. Sometimes it overheats, so I have to turn it off. Now I have big problem with the antennae. Can't call and text, can't receive calls and messages either. Worked OK, camera is just OK and it is slower than high end Samsung's etc but that I expected at this price. After a couple of months though WiFi stopped working rendering it quite useless. After reading some of the other reviews here this is obviously a larger issue and may need to be recalled. ASUS will not even troubleshoot the issue which again leads me to wonder. The RMA process is long and involved you will be without your phone for weeks possibly. Then there is no guarantee you will not get a phone with the same and other issues. This is my first experience with ASUS I am disappointed.. Pages: 1 2 3 … 64 65 ». Total of 1288 user reviews and opinions for Asus Zenfone 3 Max ZC520TL ..

I lost my ZenFone 3 Laser and decided to "step down" to the MAX. Found it's a far better choice for me. I wanted a reasonable phone with good camera. This phone's camera is superior to the Laser, which they market as "fast", and it's everything but. The MAX is missing features (slo-mo video, manual control, DoF) the Laser had, but it shoots beautiful, tack-sharp images in a rich and realistic color range. It comes (only) with the following pre-sets: Auto, HDR, Beautification, Super Resolution, Low Light, QR code, Night, Effect, Selfie, Panorama, Time Lapse. Images are 2304 x 4096 px (16:9) on 'Fine'.and it supports a 4160 x 3120 (4:3) ratio as well. Video Stabilization, Self-timer, Focus mode, WB, and other features are available in Settings. This is by no means a good low-light camera, and has a tendency to wash out (halo) overexposed areas. But for a budget phone, and especially compared to the ZenPhone Laser, this phone a very good choice for those who want/need to take decent pictures.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Broke spontaneously, shameful customer service.. Color: Glacier Silver | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. I was out running one day with the phone strapped in my arm band when it suddenly started vibrating and wouldn't stop. I rebooted it, factory reset all that jazz, would not stop. I contacted customer support and they brainlessly sent me a form response saying to 1) Try a factory reset and if that doesn't work 2) Try removing the battery and doing a battery reset. After trying to open the case in vain and scratching it all up I looked online and OH, BTW, THEIR OWN SITE SAYS NOT TO DO THIS WITH THIS MODEL OF PHONE. Not only is it not designed to, but doing so would VOID THE WARRANTY. The support clerk obviously didn't even bother checking the model of phone I had noted. So I wrote explaining this and did not get a response for two days. Finally, I got angry and wrote back that this is unacceptable, I am without my smartphone, and I want a new one in the mail. Then I found their "Instant RMA" form on their website and decided to try that. It claims you can get automatic return authorization so long as you are under warranty. I submitted the form and got an automated e-mail response saying I would have to contact customer support either by phone or online chat to initiate step two of their instant but not instant RMA process. So I went to the ASUS site and looked under customer support. Oh, lovely, the English phone support lists all the products they offer phone support for. So I went to the site to do a chat support. The clerk was polite in tone and "Happy to help", but responded by chat once every five minutes on average. After 45 minutes he suddenly DISAPPEARED and ended the chat. So three days later I had time to try again. It took 1.5 hours to tell the clerk I wanted to do the RMA step two, answer two or three questions, and have her say "OK here is your RMA number". This time, I got a chat response once every seven minutes, on average. At the end she gave me my RMA # and said to expect shipping instructions in my e-mail within fifteen minutes. Well, that was about a week ago. They never came Checked my spam. I have owned an ASUS Zenbook for years and so I bought this phone but greatly regret it. At this point I've kind of given up and will never buy an ASUS product again. Even if they offered me a brand new one I might not even take it because of all the pain and frustration this has caused.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Starts with great battery, but unfortrunately doesn't hold up like it should. Keep looking for a better phone. Color: Glacier Silver | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. Great battery, but unfortrunately I need to downgrade my rating. Had 40% on the battery, so I pwered it down to charge it for a little while before headding out the door. Unplugged it and powered it on. It turned on, asked for my code to boot android then showed the asus logo with spinning symbol for the next two hours while plugged in. So it apperently bricked itself whilst turning on. Cue factory reset and it works again. Then they rolled out nouget, which requires a few updates of other apps and services to unbreak most of the apps. After the nouget update the completely awesome battery life is merely great. So while the phone is a pretty good one, I have some reservations about recommending it and some trust issues as to if it will work after turning it off. Finger print scanner has quit working. After almost a year this battery sucks. For something that started only dropping to 50% after a whole day of moderate use im down to 20% by the end of the day. Lithium batteries should have a better lifespan especially when not using them hard. Wife's identical phone develped bluetooth connection issues and a wifi issue thst would shut down the phone when WIFI would connect. Easily one of the worst longevity of a phone I've had.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars I do not recommend this phone at all. Color: Glacier Silver | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. Two months ago I bought this phone, and without any reason stopped working, I froze the screen and then did not want to boot more, I tried to reset it, to reload the operating system using an SD and is not possible as the system is not available On the ASUS page, the US version (US_Phone-13.1.4.17-20161011) does not exist on the page. Totally disengaged from ASUS, I had always trusted the brand but with this problem without any reason and to not have a support I feel cheated. I do not recommend this phone at all. Was this review helpful to you?. This phone lasted only 13 months. For the first months, the battery lasted more than 3 days. 1.0 out of 5 stars battery runs out fast!. I bought this phone as a back-up. When I've had to use it, it is extremely slow. And I don't even have any apps on it besides work email. 3.0 out of 5 stars It's cheap but not that great. Bought this phone mid-September 2017 for my mother to replace her BLU phone. The 16GB of storage agrees with her far more than 8GB. 5.0 out of 5 stars Mom Approved!. This smart phone is good and useful for a low budget phone but is also a piece of crap because it is slow and the UI is unresponsive a lot and for 2 gb of ram more crap. 2.0 out of 5 stars It's crap. Speaker is located in such a weird spot. If you make a call, your hand covers up the speaker. Also, the camera is so slow (lags). 3.0 out of 5 stars It's okay.. It's a good value, but it does tend to drop its Wi-Fi connection. Didn't have that problem with my previous, very basic, ASUS zenfone 2e.. 4.0 out of 5 stars Good value, questionable wi-fi (for me). The speaker stop working within one week. 1.0 out of 5 stars Stop working. Very long lasting battery life! I average about 7-9 hours with heavy usage with this phone in typically remote areas where phones have to work harder to get signal so this is a... 4.0 out of 5 stars Long battery life!. 1.0 out of 5 stars I return it. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars.

Asus ZenFone 3 Max ZC520TL Smartphone Review. Florian Wimmer ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 01/09/2017. Android ARM Smartphone Touchscreen. Asus' ZenFone 3 Max aims to impress with its high-capacity battery and satisfy all runtime-junkies. However, they will have to make compromises in other aspects as our test shows.. Â» Multimedia , Â» Gaming , Â» Lightweight Gaming Â» Budget Office , Â» Business , Â» Workstations Â» Subnotebooks , Â» Ultrabooks , Â» Convertibles. Top 10 under 300 Euros , Â». Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here .. Even cheap smartphones should now also convey some premium-range feeling. Since this cannot be implemented everywhere for logical reasons, the manufacturers concentrate on individual aspects such as good cameras, high performance or long battery life as in our review sampleâs case, Asus' ZenFone 3 Max ZC520TL. It is priced at around 200 Euros (~$210) and has a screen diagonal of 5.2 inches and a 15.6-watt hour battery, which is quite impressive. was a 5.5-inch handset, which allowed incorporating an even larger battery.. LG has also specialized in affordable devices, each having. one outstanding feature in its X series.. is the handset with the largest battery here.. Huawei's Y6 II Compact , and. are also in the same price range, but they have a "standard" capacity battery.. Test device courtesy of Asus Deutschland. (download rating image as PNG or SVG ). Zenfone 3 Max ZC520TL ( Zenfone Series ). 5.2 inch 16:9, 1280 x 720 pixel 282 PPI, capacitive touchscreen, IPS, glossy: yes. 1 USB 2.0, Card Reader: micro-SD max. 32 GB, 1 Fingerprint Reader, Brightness Sensor, Sensors: accelerometer, proximity meter, compass, USB OTG. 802.11 b/g/n (b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0, GSM (850/â900/â1800/â1900), UMTS (850/â900/â1900/â2100), LTE (B1/âB2/âB3/âB5/âB7/âB8/âB20); bandwidth (download/âupload): 150Mbps/â50Mbps (LTE); SAR rate: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.86 W/kg (body), Dual SIM, LTE, GPS. height x width x depth (in mm): 8.55 x 149.5 x 73.7 ( = 0.34 x 5.89 x 2.9 in). 15.6 Wh, 4100 mAh Lithium-Ion, Battery runtime (according to manufacturer): 30 h.

Compared with the bulkier predecessor, the ZenFone 3 Max is now much slimmer and at a height of 8.55 millimeters (~0.3 in), no longer stands out from the masses of mid-range smartphones.. is even slimmer, even though it is equipped with an equally sized battery. The weight of 148 grams (~5.2 oz) has also been reduced by over 50 grams (~1.8 oz) compared with the predecessor. ZenFone Max was a 5.5-inch device, the weight loss is impressive.. The casing is metal, and the glass that is lightly curved at the edges covers the front. The design is round and ergonomic, but it does not stand out from other mid-range smartphones. The colors are also traditional: Silver with a white front, dark-gray with a black front or completely gold.. Pressure on the front is seen slightly in the liquid crystals, but the casing is very rigid and cannot be twisted otherwise. The antenna stripes on the rear are lowered into the casing and the resulting edges are obvious but not unpleasant. Transitions can also be felt between the glass and the metal bezel on the front, and they could feel rather rough. Overall, the quality impression is slightly above category standard; only the metal casing distinguishes our review sample from many equally priced devices.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage capacity are decent and the comparison devices cannot compete with that. They have only 2 GB of RAM and 16 of storage to offer. The huge battery can also be used as a mobile power bank, i.e. friends' devices can be recharged, for example. Data sharing with external storage devices is just possible.. Two SIM cards are supported, but the user will have to choose either a second SIM card or a micro-SD card. An FM radio is also installed.. We performed a system update during our test. However, the Android version remained at 6.0. The security patches are dated August, which is already quite old. Asus has adapted the user interface's appearance with its ZenUI 3.0. The system looks rounder, more colorful and has larger buttons. The modifications are mainly on the surface. The system memory is locked, and Android can only be loaded after entering the correct PIN.. Asus provides animated widgets for the lock screen. The smartphone can be customized with themes and an overlay that enables optimizing the performance or searching for information regarding the game while playing it. Some apps for photo editing are also preloaded. Basically, this could have been omitted since corresponding, mostly free apps can also be found in the Play Store..

The ZenFone 3 Max supports LTE Cat.4 and comes with four bands in both the GSM and UMTS networks, as well as seven bands in the LTE network. This is quite impressive since most competitors offer less. However, connecting the smartphone to a network outside of Europe could get difficult. The reception in an urban area via the well-developed Vodafone network was good, and we usually had at least 3/4 of the signal indoors.. The user will have to be satisfied with the 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi standards. Consequently, browsing in the 5 GHz network is not possible. Users who have a fast 802.11ac network at home will not be able to utilize it either. Data is transferred at speeds that are normal for an 802.11n device, but more would have also been possible here too..

The GPS/GLONASS module could not track us indoors, but we were located quickly with an accuracy of 3 meters (~10 ft) outdoors.. We take Asus' ZenFone 3 Max alongside Garmin's Edge 500 professional navigation system, developed specifically for cyclists, on a bike ride. The professional device had a bad day in the crossing area; we have seen considerably more accurate route data from the system. The ZenFone recorded our route fairly accurately. Some dropouts occurred while crossing the bridge, but the ZenFone traced our route relatively accurately otherwise. Thus, it can definitely be recommended for non-professional navigating..

Asus has redesigned the phone app, but it still functions very much like Google's standard app. The keypad opens when the app is launched, the recently called and incoming phone numbers are displayed at the top. Contacts, favorites, and groups can be accessed via tabs, and numbers can be easily blocked.. The earpiece transmits the contact's voice quite clearly, but not excessively loud. On the other hand, the microphone's voice transmission is rather tinny. The contact sounded slightly muffled via hands-free mode, and the microphone transmitted even more noise to the contact. Overall, it is possible to make relatively intelligible calls using Asus' ZenFone 3 Max, but its call quality will not win any awards.. Asus' ZenFone 3 Max is exactly on category average with a 13-megapixel camera on the rear and 5-megapixels on the front. Nothing has changed compared with the predecessor, at least in terms of megapixel count. It has actually been slimmed down: The laser auto-focus and dual-LED flash found in the predecessor have been omitted here.. We tested the rear-facing camera on an afternoon walk. Since the sun was already setting, the scenario was quite demanding. The primary camera in Asus' ZenFone 3 Max hardly convinces here: Barely any outlines are visible in dark areas, color surfaces look blotchy, and the photo is overall relatively blurry. presents its much higher quality here. Hardly any outlines in dark areas are visible in very high-contrast photos, such as our candlelight test shots. At least the flames are not overexposed. The colors, however, look much too cool here.. The rear-facing camera records videos at a maximum of 1080p at 30 frames per second. The exposure adapts very quickly, and releasing the auto-focus manually, which is also fast, helps when photographing nearby objects. The color reproduction is decent and the image sharpness is good.. The front-facing camera shoots decent photos at a maximum of 5 megapixels. The dynamics could be a bit higher in dark areas and a slight color noise is also visible. However, the front-facing camera is overall satisfactory.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. The primary camera in Asus' ZenFone 3 Max produces decent photos that are relatively sharp under defined light conditions in the test lab. The blurred edges of text are noticed on a red background, but then the edges are too sharp on a green background. The photos also look quite dark here.. A look at the color chart also confirms this. Many color tones are too dark and yellow tones are too bright compared to the reference color space.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. In addition to the power supply and USB cable, a USB OTG adapter that, for example, allows connecting another device via USB for charging or connecting an external storage device, is found in the box of Asus' ZenFone 3 Max. A SIM tool for the slot is also included.. Some general accessories for Zenphones are listed on. Asus' website , but product-specific accessories are only available for the premium models. The ZenFone 3 Max is unfortunately not one of them.. is limited to only 12 months.. The ZenUI keyboard developed by Asus is preset. Personally, we like the more basic GBoard by Google with fewer double assignments and larger keys. However, it first has to be downloaded from Google's Play Store. Asus only preloads its proprietary keyboard app. However, it also allows fast typing and offers many input modes.. The fingerprint scanner is situated on the rear. It allows unlocking the smartphone quickly and it can be used for waking up the smartphone from standby. The sensor can also be used for taking pictures, launching the camera or accepting calls.. Asus has also installed a gesture and touch control called ZenMotion. It allows waking up the smartphone via double-tap or launching apps by inputting letters on a turned off smartphone. However, activating it is rather complicated since it is not enough to turn the slider to "on" in the settings menu. The item itself has to be tapped and the individual gestures have to be enabled manually.. The volume control and standby button are readily accessible and their roughened surface make them easy to feel. They have an accurate pressure point.. A 720p-resolution screen is standard in this category, and only. stands out with its Full HD panel here. The screen's average brightness of 474 cd/mÂ² is quite bright, even though the. The illumination of 85% is not very homogeneous: A difference of over 70 cd/mÂ² is measured between the darkest and the brightest area in maximum brightness. This is visible on large color surfaces when looking closely.. 431 cd/m² 500 cd/m² 476 cd/m² 434 cd/m² 507 cd/m² 476 cd/m² 464 cd/m² 502 cd/m² 479 cd/m². 85 % Center on Battery: 507. cd/m²) ΔE Color 4.7 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 4.8 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.25.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. The black level of 0.53 cd/mÂ² is acceptable, but. can display much blacker areas with 0.2 cd/mÂ², not to mention the AMOLED panel in. The contrast ratio of 957:1 is rather mediocre. We did not ascertain any image flickering due to pulse width modulation.. The screen's color accuracy is satisfactory when compared with the sRGB reference color space. However, the color space coverage is only just below 85%. A very light greenish tint can be seen in brighter grayscale levels when looking closely. A blue light filter (a warmer white balance) with 5 levels is also present..

This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Although the screen is quite bright, it has problems defying reflections in bright surroundings outdoors. The ambient light sensor does a good job, but it is nevertheless difficult to recognize something on the smartphone in bright sunlight.. The viewing angles are good, and the image is clearly visible from all sides. The camera is more sensitive to the slight color shifts than the human eye.. The SoC in our review sample is MediaTek's. It is built in the 28-nanometer process and has four CPU cores based on the 64-bit capable Cortex A53 architecture. Although it is an entry-level SoC, it always ensured smooth navigation in, for example,. We cannot say this is always true for Asus' ZenFone 3 Max. Stutters or waiting times occurred time and again. They were not dramatic, but Asus' ZenFone 3 Max did not convey a quite as smooth impression as most competing devices. We assume that this is due to the Asus' modified interface. The processor part of the SoC is roughly on par with the comparison devices in the benchmarks. with its upper mid-range SoC has a clear lead.. The graphics unit in Asus' ZenFone 3 Max is an. that clocks at 650 MHz and supports OpenGL ES 3.1, which is a slightly older version.

The graphics unit cannot render games such as " Asphalt 8 " smoothly even in low details. Visible stutters are seen in high details. This might also be due to the fact that Asus fades in an overlay during the game, which probably also draws on performance (small gamepad in the upper left of the screenshots).. More basic games, such as " Angry Birds " can be played on the smartphone without any issues. Users who play 3D-games with high graphics requirements will have to opt for a higher-performance smartphone.. Control via touchscreen and position sensor was very accurate in all games in our tests.. A slight temperature increase is noticed during load with a maximum temperature of 40.4 Â°C (~105 Â°F), but it is not unpleasant and it is also very much limited to one area. The idle load temperature is hardly felt.. We check whether the system can maintain its performance with the GFXBench battery test.

The speaker in Asus' ZenFone 3 Max is situated on the rear and muffles audibly when the smartphone is placed on a table. In fact, not much sound is heard at all. The sound can be adapted in several preset profiles via the audio assistant. Furthermore, a button for an outdoor mode appears when changing the volume via the volume control. It increases the high tones and supposedly increases intelligibility in the outdoors.. This does not contribute to the speaker's already relatively thin and treble-heavy sound. At least the other profiles provide a somewhat more balanced sound. Smart mode selects the suitable profile automatically. Overall, the sound is not very convincing. Although it is fairly loud, it does not present audible basses and is very treble-heavy.. The 3.5-mm jack and Bluetooth provide a balanced audio signal.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 41 25 25.4 41 31 25.3 35.4 40 32.9 30.5 50 33.6 33.3 63 31.6 27.7 80 28.4 29.6 100 27 27.5 125 20.8 24.2 160 22 29.2 200 21.3 26.7 250 20.8 34.7 315 21.2 42.9 400 19.4 49 500 19.5 55.3 630 17.7 60.8 800 17.9 67.4 1000 17.8 74.8 1250 17.3 79.1 1600 17.4 79 2000 16.7 77.3 2500 17.2 76.2 3150 18.2 74.1 4000 17.9 73.5 5000 17.6 76.6 6300 17.7 75.4 8000 17.8 78 10000 17.9 79 12500 18.1 66.5 16000 18.2 58.6 SPL 30 88 N 1.3 68.5 median 17.9 Asus Zenfone 3 Max ZC520TL median 67.4 Delta 1.3 16.6 31.6 53.4 25.4 32.9 25.3 30 32.9 37.2 33.6 40.6 31.6 40.4 28.4 32.4 27 29.2 20.8 23.8 22 22.5 21.3 27.7 20.8 34.6 21.2 40.6 19.4 48.9 19.5 55 17.7 60.4 17.9 69.2 17.8 74.9 17.3 80.1 17.4 77.1 16.7 73.7 17.2 75 18.2 75.5 17.9 74.2 17.6 74.9 17.7 78.7 17.8 82.7 17.9 77 18.1 66.8 18.2 64.8 30 88.5 1.3 71.5 median 17.9 LG X Power K220 median 69.2 1.3 15.5 37.7 27.7 32.4 37.7 22.3 30.6 31.3 22.3 26.5 29.1 31.7 26.5 29 31.4 26 29 32.3 37.2 39.4 32.3 29 27.7 36.2 29 24.6 27.6 28.6 24.6 23.2 23.4 25.4 23.2 28.3 21.8 21.3 28.3 30.8 23.2 23.3 30.8 34.5 24 22.5 34.5 37.2 22.9 22.4 37.2 42.1 26.9 21.3 42.1 47.4 28.2 18.4 47.4 56.2 36.1 17.5 56.2 62.6 41.5 17.5 62.6 70.8 48.6 17.2 70.8 75.8 53.7 16.8 75.8 72.4 50.2 17.3 72.4 70.5 48.1 17.4 70.5 68.1 46.7 16.6 68.1 67.2 45.1 17.3 67.2 68.5 47.2 17.6 68.5 70.9 49.4 17.6 70.9 74.9 53.2 17.7 74.9 76.5 54.4 17.4 76.5 76.3 54.7 17.7 76.3 65.2 42.6 17.9 65.2 51.3 30.7 18.1 51.3 46.8 26.1 18.1 46.8 84.1 62.2 29.8 84.1 56.7 14.7 1.3 56.7 median 65.2 Samsung Galaxy J5 2016 median 42.6 median 17.7 median 65.2 13.9 11.2 1.6 13.9 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Thus, the good battery life is mainly due to the high-capacity battery. The battery can provide 4100 mAh or 15.6-watt hours. This allows our review sample to last 13:34 hours in the Wi-Fi test.. with an equally sized battery, however, achieves 16:27 hours thanks to its considerably lower consumption.. Nevertheless, the runtime of Asus' ZenFone 3 Max is impressive and is easily enough for two workdays when games are not played. When the smartphone is not used frequently, it might have to be reconnected to an outlet after four days. Super savings mode extends the battery life when it gets tight.

In review: Asus ZenFone 3 Max. Review sample courtesy of Asus Germany.. Asus' ZenFone 3 Max keeps its most important promise: Its battery life is really extremely long. As pleasing as this is, we have to say that. We like the review sample's casing; it is very high-quality for this price range, but it does not stand out from the masses of smartphones. More positive qualities are found in the decent screen, low idle power consumption and low temperature development.. We did not like the performance as much. The device is rather slower than its competitors in all aspects. Perhaps this is due to Asus' ZenUI interface? The device is only conditionally suitable for 3D games, but more sophisticated websites could also be a problem.. The ZenFone 3 Max offers a good memory configuration for this price range, can handle two SIM cards, and is light and slim. The handset will be a good deal for anyone mainly focusing on battery life.. Compared with its direct predecessor, the. ZenFone Max , our review sample does many things better, but it has lost some of its runtime. Asus' ZenFone 3 Max is a successful update and seen on its own, it is primarily suitable for runtime-junkies. Everyone else will have to make compromises in camera, speaker, and call quality. But this is not unusual in this price range.. Asus Zenfone 3 Max ZC520TL - 2017-01-02 01/02/2017 v6 Florian Wimmer. Read all 2 comments / answer.

ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC520TL Reviews. Featuring 5.2 inches display, Android 6.0 OS and, 1.5 GHz processor.. 5.2 inches, 720 x 1280 pi... 2G, 3G, 4G (LTE), 32GB, 3GB ... Please feel free to post your review on this product.. Is it inferior to the first model?. I am a first generation MAX user. Along with iPhone 5S, I have been using the first generation MAX, and when I first heard about its successor model, I got excited and went to have a look. I tried for about 30 minutes, and decided not to make an impulse purchase. Well, actually, it seems to be degraded, so I decided not to. I would like to show my disappointment here.. Well, the body made of metal did have a high-end feel. But other smartphones are doing it, too, and it felt colder than the body with leather grain. It was more angular than the first generation, and honestly, I found it boring.. It is big like the first generation, but it cannot be helped as it is MAX.. The first generation had a electrostatic physical button, but probably to cut the cost, it now has buttons on the screen. It is difficult to use, and It feels like a waste of space.. I only have tried Google map and web browsing, but it's not that different from the first generation. So it shouldn't be a problem.. UI is tiny bit cooler than the first generation. It is well done to the details.. In terms of the specification, it is worse than the first generation. This made me not to go for it. The first generation had 5000mAh, so it is totally different. Reverse charge function is expected to be used with this.. I have to tell myself, ""Right, this is a totally different product; this is Max of ZenFone 3."" I just couldn't bring myself to get this.. 5000mAh battery of the first generation MAX is amazing. I think there should be other options if you go for this not that fast MAX with not so big battery capacity.. It's been two weeks since purchase.. I don't say it looks luxurious, but it doesn't look cheap. I use it in a diary case. It fits easily in my pocket without a case.. It only has a power button and volume button. Both the feel when I press it and the response are good.. I don't play games, but my children who play games with this (they use the same model) seem happy with it, too.. There are not much choice in ringtones. Well, I am not fussy with ringtones, so I don't have any complaints.. I got it on the 14th January at 10 in the morning. Since then, I only have charged four times. If you use it heavily, you might need to charge it every day, but for my usage, it lasts for four days once I charge it. I am very happy with it.. I think it has high cost performance. I got this for 17,284yen, so considering how much I paid, I have no complaints at all. I am very happy with this.. Sometimes it feels hot with heating issue.. It somehow fits in my pocket. 5.2inch might be the biggest it can be for me.. It sometimes gets jumpy with games and browsing.. Because my previous phone was worse than HD, I can see small characters.. It is not as good as it is said on its ad.. What I use this smartphone for. -Puzzle and Dragons (for 2 hours). -voice calls (for about 20 minutes). I chose this for the battery capacity and price. For using this phone for above, it used about 50% of the battery. So it goes flat in 2 days. I played Puzzle and Dragons for 5 hours on my day off, it used battery in one day.. This is my first device with a fingerprint sensor. Sometimes it fails or takes time to recognize.. LED notification has two different colors; red and green. It is a pity that it doesn't have blue. When I get a notification while charging, it remains red. Green flashing light is not prioritized.. Personally, I am happy with this.. I got this for waiting for calls and for Google Play Music. The previous phone was 5.5inch and was thick, so I didn't go for it.. After using voice calls and SMS, it goes back to LTE very quickly from 3G.. It is a pity that it doesn't support aptX, but BT doesn't get disconnected easily and it sounds loud, too.. Color and resolution of the display and the camera are good enough for my usage.. Battery doesn't last as long as I expected, so I turned power saving mode on. It cannot be helped, though, because I leave Google Play Music on all the time.. As for voice call sound quality, as I am used to VoLTE, I cannot evaluate it highly. But it is unexpectedly convenient that it can record all the conversations of calls and has a function of notifying how long I am on the phone.. It has a lot of preinstalled apps. Possibly because this is my first Android 6.0, some apps I had been using regularly like MX Player Apex Launcher cannot be used with this.. This phone is good in gaming!. Playing game soft no lags no bugs, so adorable and nice spec'! Love ASUS forever!. Maganda pang gaming ang phone kung ito kasi naman ang bilis nito at hindi din ito hang ap kaya maganda ang dali lang e operate hindi din ako palaging nag charge na kasi hindi ito madaling ma lowbat kaya okay talaga ang ganda pa ng design elegant talagang tingnan so far sa pag gamit ko nito wala akung issues kaya sulit ang pera ko sa phone na ito.. Ang kunat ng battery life! Tiyak magsasawa ka kakalaro, etc then hindi mo pa kailangang mag charge ng madalas.. I would want to have the speakers at the bottom because if you are listening to music or talk with somebody while you lay your phone on the table, you wont be able to hear a thing or it would be muffled. Not impressed considering they claim to have 13mp and 5mp. Nonetheless, it's better than nothing phone.. My second hand smartphone thanks to my Ate cause she gave me her android phone to me and I like it much. I really like the design and display of this asus phone cause it was so great and also it was portable and handy phone it was not hassle to bring this and all the functions are working will. The battery life of it has a long long life. I will love this new phone of mine thanks to my Ate.. this smartphone has a elegant and presentable phone. The handy and not hassle phone so its best to have a phone like this for me its perfect. I like it because it can access the internet connection quickly and great, All the functions of it are functioning will. The camera also has a good quality of the image and the speaker is loud also so nice and the battery have a long long long life so I enjoy using this smartphone.. as of now no negative thoughts.!.

Information about the type and size (form factor) of the SIM card used in the device.. Information about the number of SIM cards, supported by the device.. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) was developed to replace the analog cellular network (1G), therefore it is referred to as a 2G mobile network. It has been improved with the addition of General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and later via the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology.. TD-SCDMA (Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access) is a 3G standard for mobile networks. It is developed as an alternative to the W-CDMA standard in China by the Chinese Academy of Telecomunications Technology, Datang Telecom and Siemens AG, and combines TDMA and CDMA.. UMTS stands for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System. Based on the GSM standard, it is deemed as a 3G mobile network standard. It has been developed by the 3GPP and its major advantage is the provision of greater bandwidth and spectral efficiency, due to the W-CDMA technology.. LTE is deemed to be the fourth generation (4G) of mobile communications technology. It has been developed by the 3GPP based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies in order to increase the speed and capacity of wireless data networks. A further development of the technology is called LTE Advanced.. There are several network technologies that enhance the performance of mobile networks mainly by increased data bandwidth. Information about the communication technologies supported by the device and their respective uplink and downlink bandwidth.. Information about the operating system used by the device as well as its version.. Name and version of the user interface (UI) used by the operating system (OS).. The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. Similar to the CPU, the GPU consists of processing units called cores. They handle the computation of graphics in various applications.. The frequency is the clock rate of the graphic processor (GPU), which is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. RAM (Random-Access Memory) is used by the operating system and all installed applications. Data in the RAM is lost after the device is turned off or restarted.. Information about the type of RAM used by the device.. Information about the number of RAM channels integrated in the SoC. More channels mean higher data transfer rates.. RAM frequency relates directly to the rate of reading/writing from/in the RAM memory.. Information about the capacity of the built-in storage of the device. Sometimes one and the same model may is offered in variants with different internal storage capacity.. The various types of memory cards are characterized by different sizes and capacity. Information about the supported types of memory cards.. One of the main characteristics of the display is its type/technology, on which depends its performance.. In mobile devices display size is represented by the length of its diagonal measured in inches.. The ratio between the long and the short side of the display. The display resolution shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical side of the screen. The higher the resolution is, the greater the detail of the displayed content.. Information about the number of pixels per centimeter (ppcm) or per inch (ppi) of the display. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed and clearer is the information displayed on the screen.. The color depth of the display is also known as bit depth. It shows the number of bits used for the color components of one pixel. Information about the maximum number of colors the screen can display.. The estimated percentage of the screen area from the device's front area.. Information about other functions and features of the display.. Sensors vary in type and purpose. They increase the overall functionality of the device, in which they are integrated.. Digital cameras use image sensors for taking photos. The sensor characteristics are some of the main factors determining the quality of the camera integrated in the mobile device.. Aperture (f-stop number) indicates the size of the lens diaphragm opening, which controls the amount of light reaching the image sensor.

ASUS follows up the original ZenFone Max with a new entry-level phone with the same battery pedigree and a cutthroat price.. ASUS has just released a huge crop of shiny new ZenFones as a huge push to follow up its popular ZenFone 2 line last year. But the sleek new smartphones perhaps came with a price: all that beautiful shiny glass and metal with state of the art technology has to come with a price. Last year ASUS was competing mainly in the budget market with their affordable ZenFone 2.. But this year, ASUS' ZenFone 3 and ZenFone 3 Deluxe are fighting in the PHP16,000 and PHP30,000 range, a far cry from last year's sub-PHP10,000 ZenFone 2. ASUS hasn't forgotten the segment that got them this far, and they're here with a wonderful treat for the budget crowd: the ZenFone 3 Max. At just PHP8,995, the ZenFone 3 Max fits right into the entry-level market and delivers quite a punch while it's at it.. The Max has a full metal body with antenna lines and a slightly-curved display with 2.5D arc glass. It has a 5.2-inch HD 720p IPS screen, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. On the rear is the 13-megapixel main camera with autofocus and LED flash, supported by a 5-megapixel front-facing selfie shooter. It has all the usual LTE, WiFi and other connectivity options of a modern smartphone, but ASUS sweetens the deal with a fingerprint sensor, which is unusual for a device at this price range.. Moreover, the ZenFone 3 Max has one other important trick up its sleeve: a massive 4,100mAh battery. The "Max" refers to maximum battery life, and while the phone is a bit heavy and doesn't have the same elegant design as its other Zenvolution siblings, the Max makes up for its relatively chunky design with long battery life. It has enough current inside that its micro-USB port works with an OTG adapter to allow you to charge USB devices that don't need 2.1A to charge.. So while ASUS may have decided to up its game moving up to the mid-range and flagship levels with its other ZenFones, they haven't forgotten to provide a strong offering at the budget-level, and the ZenFone 3 Max may end up to be the best-selling phone in their lineup with its aggressive pricing..

ASUS Zenfone 3 Max quick review â when battery life is of utmost importance Source: Laptop Media As we expected, the available 4130mAh battery is Zenfone 3 Maxâs key advantage in its battle with the competitive models in this price range. Apart from ensuring high durability, it is also complemented by several battery saving modes which can significantly increase battery life between separate charges. They are part of the feature-rich Zen user interface by ASUS which complements the Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS in the best possible way. Additionally, you get an HD display which ensures good enough image detail plus high brightness levels allowing easy use when outdoors.

So, if you are ready to spend 18k then itâs a perfect choice. Single Review, online available, Short, Date: 12/02/2016 Rating: Total score : 100% price: 90% performance: 100%. Asus Zenfone 3 Max ZC553Kl Review: Mid-Range Dilemma Source: Unbox If youâre looking to grab a member of the ASUS ZF3 family and have limited funds, then you canât do any better than the 5.5-inch version of the ZF3 Max. It has many of the same features that both the ZF3 Laser and the smaller ZF3 Max have â big battery, fast performance and insane battery life â at a price thatâs hard to beat. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 11/30/2016. Asus Zenfone 3 Max 5.5 Review Source: Yugatech The Asus Zenfone 3 Max 5.5 (ZC553KL) is yet another quality smartphone from Asus. Although, itâs already above the Php10k mark making it a bit difficult to suggest among budget consumers who prefers long battery life. At Php10,995, itâs a good balance for what youâre getting and this makes it the second cheapest Zenfone 3 member you can purchase. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 11/30/2016. ASUS ZenFone 3 Max (ZC550KL) Review Source: Mobygyaan People already wants a phone with longer battery life and you are the one, consider it if you like the brand value. There are some alternatives to it like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 which also comes to play when itâs a showdown for the battery runtime, but only if you want a phone without a recognized brand and yes, the camera of course. Even though its smaller sized form factor, I like the design, the camera, and its battery life. What I would expect here would be a better CPU at this price range. Overall, the long battery run is a deal breaker. Not to mention it can charge other phones, consider it also as a 4,100 mAh pocket power bank. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 11/26/2016. Asus ZenFone 3 Max Review: Big Battery, Low Price Source: Mobile and Apps If you need a smartphone that packs a great battery, you might need to look at the Asus ZenFone 3 Max. It is one of the many phones that Asus has released in its lineup and promises steady performance on the user end. Single Review, online available, Very Short, Date: 11/24/2016. Asus Zenfone 3 Max 5.5-Inch Zc553Kl Unboxing, Initial Review: Zf3 Laser Replacement? Source: Unbox The only thing missing now is price â thereâs no pricing for the 5.5-inch ZF3 Max in the Philippines yet unfortunately, but if India pricing is anything to go by, itâll probably retail close to the SRP of the Zenfone 3 Laser. Thatâs why we think that ASUS may discontinue the ZF3 Laser, since their prices are so close to each other anyway. The 5.5 ZF3 Max having an almost identical feature set with the ZF3 Laser means that the two phones will cannibalize each other in the market if theyâre both available. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 11/22/2016. 70% Asus Zenfone 3 Max Review- The Latest Premium Smartphone under 20K Source: Tech Magnifier The Asus Zenfone 3 Max impresses when it comes to gaming performance, video playback and battery backup. The battery lasts more than a day in average usage and about a day in heavy usage. The screen is visible in direct sunlight and color is rendering is also appropriate. But considering the price there are better options available such as Le eco Le Max 2, One plus 3 and Mi Max Prime.

Asus ZenFone 3 Max review: Long-lasting battery, dependable hardware Source: The Indian Express Yes, if your pain-point is battery and you just need good performance overall on other fronts, then this is among the best bets in the market at the moment. Given the price, the Asus ZenFone 3 Max seems good value for money given that it offers a dependable piece of hardware that will keep most users happy. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 11/11/2016. ASUS ZenFone 3 Max (ZC520TL) Hands on [Images] Source: Mobygyaan Given that the hardware is relatively low powered along with the display, the 4,100 mAh battery should offer a plenty of uptime. It is priced at â¹12,999 and available on online and offline stores. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 11/10/2016. 70% Asus Zenfone 3 Max review: The prowess lies in battery Source: Gadget Show The Asus Zenfone 3 Max is no doubt one of the best handsets in the particular series I've come across so far. It has a huge battery capacity of 4100mAh, which is not the highest but good enough to keep the device running for over a full day of use. There are other battery-focussed handsets too in the market but are priced higher. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 11/10/2016 Rating: Total score : 70%. 60% Asus ZenFone 3 Max 5.5 review: Good build, great battery; but for Rs 17,999 look elsewhere Source: Tech2.in.com I canât for the life of me figure out why Asus has priced the ZenFone 3 Max as they did. I appreciate the battery life and the build quality at this asking price of Rs 17,999, but that sluggish SoC completely ruins the experience for me. The elephant in the room is, of course, the Redmi Note 3, and that device sells for about Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000 less than the ZenFone 3 Max. It also offers a massive performance bump, a better camera and the same battery life. Why would anyone in their right minds pick a ZenFone 3 Max over the Redmi Note 3, at the current pricing?

The ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) will cost buyers Rs 17,999. It's mighty expensive and easily forgettable. Especially, when a phone like the Redmi 3S Prime offers so much more (even equally good battery life, at just about Rs 9,000) in actual usage. Not to forget, phones like the Moto G4 Plus and the Lenovo Vibe K5 Note are equally competitive. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 11/09/2016 Rating: Total score : 65%. ZenFone 3 Max Review: Maximised the battery experience Source: The Mobile Indian ZenFone 3 Max Review: Maximised the battery experience. The Zenfone 3 Max comes out as a decent smartphone to keep in your wish list. The battery output and camera performance are impressive. Even the performance will not disappoint.. The only issue that Asus needs to sort out at the earliest in to remove bloatware they need to give users freedom to choose what they want to download. Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 11/09/2016. 70% Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) Review Source: NDTV Gadgets The ZenFone Max name no longer means you're getting a one-trick pony, as this new model aims to offer a well-rounded solution to aspiring smartphone buyers. This shows in the new aesthetics, improved display and cameras, and of course, solid battery life. It would have made a perfect rival to Xiaomiâs Redmi Note 3, but Asus has priced the ZenFone 3 Max in line with higher aspirations. Keep in mind that the ZC520TL variant does fall in the Redmi's price range but it doesn't seem to match up to it, at least on paper. It's also important that you check the model number behind the box carefully as its easy to confuse the two versions.

ASUS Zenfone 3 Max ZC553KL Review Source: Fone Arena The Zenfone 3 Max is quite a decent smartphone and this is something that can be said for the entire Zenfone range. It however lacks a differentiating factor. In fact even within itâs own product lineup, Asus would find it hard to set the Max aside given that phones like the Zenfone 3 Laser too have really good battery life. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 11/08/2016. 60% ASUS ZenFone 3 Max review: Battery capacity isn't everything Source: Hardware Zone The ASUS ZenFone 3 Max will have a tough time measuring up to its own past model and rivals. For an extra S$50, you get a 1080p display and better battery life with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, but the same price will net you the older ZenFone Max that comes with a larger battery capacity and significantly longer battery life - exactly what we expect out of a "Max" class ZenFone product.

ASUS Zenfone 3 Max Review Source: Yugatech The Zenfone 3 Max is more of an update rather than an upgrade for the Max series of the Zenfone. The smaller screen size is the culprit behind the shrunken battery capacity. While itâs still above the standard Android phone battery life, itâs not as impressive as before or even when compared to its Zenfone 3 siblings.

ASUS Zenfone 3 Max Battery Benchmark Results Source: Unbox The ZF3 Max is shaping up to be a promising smartphone on its own right â weâre in the middle of the review process of the phone and the review should be out by next week.

ASUS Zenfone 3 Max Review: More Than Just A Glorified Powerbank Source: Unbox While the original Zenfone Max delivered insane battery endurance, it sacrificed everything else to get that legendary battery performance. Thatâs not the case with the Zenfone 3 Max â while it performs a little worse in the battery department because of the smaller capacity, itâs a better phone in almost every other category. ASUS compromised a little bit on the battery to give users a phone thatâs not just a glorified powerbank, and theyâve succeeded. Single Review, online available, Short, Date: 09/12/2016. ASUS Zenfone 3 Max Unboxing, Initial Review: Big Battery, High Fashion Source: Unbox Thatâs pretty much it for this initial review for the Zenfone 3 Max.

Model : Asus has just introduced the new Zenfone 3 Max, which focuses on delivering best possible battery life without making too many compromises. The result was a decent package that balances performance and price well enough, while still delivering its key objective. The phone is encased in a 149.5 x 73.7 x 8.6 mm sand-blasted aluminium alloy body, and weighs about 148 g. With a thin 2.25 mm bezel and 75% screen-to-body ratio, it allows for more display and less bulk. Its 5.2-inch IPS touchscreen is covered by 2.5D protective glass with oleophobic coating, so fingerprints will not be an issue. The screen has a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels, 16M colors and a brightness of 400 nits for easy viewing under direct sunlight.. The Zenfone 3 Max runs on Android v6.0.1 Marshmallow with ZenUI 3.0 out of the box. The ZC520TL variant is powered by a quad-core Mediatek MT6737M SoC clocked at 1.45 GHz. This variant comes with the option of either 16 GB storage with 2 GB RAM or 32 GB storage with 3 GB RAM, but both have a microSD card slot which allows adding up to 358 GB. But the crowning jewel of the Zenfone 3 Max is its considerably large 4100 mAh battery. The phoneâs ZenUI 3.0 brings super saving modes, which allows the phone to squeeze out more juice from its battery. The super saving modes are pre-configured to maximize every last milliamp, and, when enabled, can extend ZenFone 3 Maxâs standby time by 36 hours â even when itâs as low as 10%. The Zenfone 3 Maxâs ability to perform reverse-charging is what truly sets it apart from other devices on the market. Thanks to its large battery capacity, the Zenfone 3 Max can double up as a power bank to charge other digital devices.. The Zenfone 3 Max has a 13 MP primary camera with f/2.2 aperture, autofocus, and LED flash. It can take high-resolution photos with zero shutter lag, and record 1080p videos at 30 fps. It also has a 5 MP secondary front camera with f/2.0 aperture, which shoots sharp selfies and is able to produce clear video chats. It is also notable that in one of the Zenfone Max 3âs PixelMaster modes, i.e. the Super Resolution mode, the device can capture multiple shots simultaneously for a single photograph with stunning 52 MP detail. The other two PixelMaster modes are HDR mode, which can see clearly through daytime shadow, and Low Light mode, which takes clear and bright photos, even in poor lighting conditions. Just below the rear camera is the phoneâs fingerprint sensor, which unlocks the phone in 0.3 seconds. Swiping down the fingerprint sensor will summon the selfie camera, and the sensor also acts like a second shutter button, which can be tapped to snap a photo. The Zenfone 3 Max is truly one of a kind. It offers a good design and great battery life for just a fraction of the price.. This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. In the notebook sector, Asus had a global market share of about 11% from 2014-2016, making it the fourth largest laptop manufacturer. In the smartphone sector, Asus is not among the Top 5 and has only a small market share (as of 2016).. Similar devices from a different Manufacturer. Prestigio Muze C7 LTE Mali-T720 MP2.
