Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro review – only thing to talk about is the battery. By Gogi Rana on July 15, 2016 16 Comments. Antutu (32bit) – 25896 | 3D score –3321. Internal storage Speed – Read (161MB/s), Write (81MB/s). Galaxy On5 Pro Battery Performance (time / battery % drop / estimated battery temperature). Running Benchmark app – 10 minutes / 3% / 32 degrees. Asphalt 8 game play – 14 minutes / 4% / 33 degrees. FHD video playback with full brightness (WiFi /4G on) – 46 minutes /10% / 33 degrees. Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro video review. 720p video shot using On5 Pro handset. Samsung Mobiles recently launched the Galaxy On5 Pro in India with a price tag of Rs. This handset comes with a TFT screen, loaded with 2GB RAM and powered by Exynos quad core processor. Read this Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro review to get an idea about the overall performance.. Inside the box : Handset, user guide, warranty card, data cable, standard quality earphone, travel charger 5V/1A and removable battery of 2600 mAh capacity. SAR value : 0.551 W/Kg head.. The On5 Pro looks exactly similar to the On5 handset that was launched last year. Galaxy On5 Pro is using a plastic body with metallic finish sides and the rear panel has got leather type texture. Build quality and finishing is good.. Weight with battery is 146 grams and dimensions are 72.02 x 142.06 x 8.30 (mm). Power button is on right side, volume rocker on left and audio jack, mic and micro USB port is at the bottom. This handset comes with a single microphone.. There is no LED notification and there are just 2 sensors – accelerometer and proximity. This is a dual SIM handset with 2x micro SIM slot and a separate micro SD card slot. On5 Pro sports a 5 inch screen (it’s a TFT screen) supporting 1280 x 720 pixels resolution. Viewing angles and color reproduction are good.. This handset is running marshmallow Android 6.0.1 out of the box.. There is 2GB RAM and 16GB ROM. On the first boot you will get around 11GB free space and 1.1GB free RAM. Users can also use micro SD card.. On5 Pro is powered by Samsung Exynos (3475) quad core processor clocked at 1.3GHz it’s 32 Bit cortex A7 hardware coupled with Mali T720 GPU. This hardware is not that powerful, occasionally you will feel the performance slowing down, lagging. In fact when it comes to gaming performance is no good.. I played the asphalt 8 game in high, medium, low and very low quality mode. The game was better, playable in very low visual quality mode but even in that mode it was lagging at times. This hardware is not for gaming users.. Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro comes with an 8MP AF camera on the rear with flash and 5MP camera on the front. There is an option to shoot FHD videos but the handset is recording videos in max 720p resolution.. Check the sample images and video at the end of this review.. Sound is loud and clear, incall sound is also very good. I did not find any issues with 4G, WiFi, GPS and Bluetooth. I did not face any issues with network quality. This handset supports 14 Indian regional languages, ultra data saving mode and S-Bike mode (press and hold power button to get the S-Bike mode option).. The 2600 mAh battery does a impressive job, in fact that is the only good thing on the On5 Pro to talk about. On a full charge you can expect 5 to 7 hours of non-stop moderate to heavy usage.. With mixed heavy usage the battery will last for up to 1 day.. It took me 2 hour 14 minutes to charge the handset using wall charger from 22% to 100%. For a full charge it will take under 3 hours.. Avoid the Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro, there are better options available in the market , but if you really want to buy a handset from the Samsung brand it is better to go with sAMOLED screen and avoid this On5 pro..

September 22, 2017 at 7:13 pm. Whats the SAR for head and body ?. June 22, 2017 at 10:44 pm. it’s a good phone from Samsung…but it’s not made for heavy gamers…it’s sound is good and loud.. battery is also good…..but if you have low brightness on flash light…then get any flash light app and use it to see the brightest flash light….thank you. May 13, 2017 at 9:52 pm. One of the worst product, worst amazon service. The outgoing call was not heard, lot of disturbance. I tried to remove the battery for 30 sec, I did factory reset, still problem persist. I even tried to install smartchk which is an absolute cheat app. It just cheats and tells the device is working fine… No help or technician came from amazon.. Today i.e., 13th may, I even went to Samsung service center they took 4 to 5 hours and said problem is resolved. However the problem still persist and outgoing calls are not at all heard. I have not even installed any app. I humbly request all customers not to purchase this product from amazon..

Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime Review- Old Wine, Old Bottle!. Honor View 10 Review- An Excellent Flagship Experience for the Price. Mobile Phones Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro Review. Design and Build: Display: Software: Performance: Camera: Battery Life: Verdict:. Published on July 28, 2016. Last year Samsung announced two devices under the On series, the On5 and On7. Now Samsung has upgraded the specs of the device and launched them as On5 Pro and On7 Pro. The On5 Pro is Amazon exclusive and comes with 5 inch HD display and is powered by Exynos Quad Core processor with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage.. It also comes with 8MP rear camera and 5MP front camera along with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. So how does the On5 Pro perform in the segment? Let’s find out in this detailed review.. There hasn’t been any design changes in the Samsung’s mid range and budget segment for quite some time now. Samsung has been maintaining the same design for almost all of its budget and mid-range phones and same is the case with Galaxy On5 Pro. The device looks dated in terms of the design and the build quality also looks average. It has almost similar design as that of Galaxy On5 released last year and there isn’t any change. The phone comes with chrome finishing on the sides similar to the J series. The power button is located on the right side while the volume keys are on the left panel. The audio jack and micro USB charging slot are located at the bottom. The front panel houses the 5-inch display, three buttons with the physical home button.. The rear panel has faux leather like finishing which was first found on Note 3. The 8MP rear camera, flash, and speaker is located on the rear panel. The phone comes in gold and black variants. While the device is pretty good to hold for the form factor, the design and build quality is pretty average considering the competition is offering better design and build in the price point.. The phone comes with a 5 inch HD display (1280 X 720p) with a TFT LCD panel instead of the regular IPS LCD panel found on most of the phone today. The TFT panel provides a decent display for the device. While the brightness levels are sufficient, the colors are not impressive, particularly when you see the AMOLED display on Galaxy J5. Samsung has opted for the cheaper TFT panel and the display looks out-dated. There is no additional protection offered on the display. Similar to J5, the On5 Pro also misses out on ambient light sensor and it comes with an outdoor mode.. Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro runs on Android 6.0.1 which is the latest version of Lollipop and has the custom Touchwiz UI from Samsung. The skinned UI offers a good amount of features including a custom notification center which is customizable. The phone comes with an app drawer and Samsung has not bundled any bloatware with the phone and hence you don’t have unnecessary apps taking up space or running in the background. The UI is pretty similar to what we see on other Samsung devices.. The phone also comes with theme manager, where you can download themes using a Samsung account and customize the phone. There are a quite a lot of themes available for download. Samsung has also included few useful apps like calculator, Memo, voice recorder, radio, S Planner and Smart manager.. The phone also comes with Smart Manager which can manage the battery storage, RAM and also make the device secure. It also has the new S Bike mode introduced with J3 (2016) which is basically a do not disturb mode when you are driving or riding a bike. The phone also comes with ultra data saving mode and ultra battery saver mode which are quite handy.. The Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro runs on Exynos Quad core processor with 2GB RAM. Samsung has improved the RAM from 1.5GB on On5 to 2GB on On5 Pro. The overall performance of the device was fairly good on moderate usage and we did not notice any issues. The software is optimized for the hardware. The gaming performance of the device was not that great and we encountered lag and frame drops when playing graphic rich games. The heat generated while playing games was considerably low.. Multi-tasking was decent on the phone, we ran multiple apps in the background including games and there was close to 1GB of RAM available.. The phone supports 4G LTE and has dual SIM card support. The call quality on the phone was decent and we didn’t notice any issues with calls. The speaker output was decent for a mid range phone.. The phone comes with 16GB of internal storage and out of which close to 10.5GB was available in first boot. Samsung has again upgraded the storage on this device. While you can expand the storage via micro SD card, but you cannot install apps directly onto the SD card. One of the missing features on the On5 pro compared to competition is the fingerprint scanner.. While most of the OEMs are concentrating on providing great camera experience even in budget segment with 13MP camera, Samsung has opted for an 8MP sensor for the rear camera and a 5MP front-facing selfie camera. The camera interface is exactly the same as that of J series and comes with auto mode, pro mode, panorama, continuous shot and beauty shot.. You can also take photos with effects. The interface offers decent features for a budget smartphone.. Now talking about the camera performance, it was a mixed bag. While some of the daylight shots came quite good with decent colors, few others had poor color reproduction. So basically the camera quality isn’t consistent. The low light images had lot of noise and weren’t great. The phone can record videos in 1080P and the quality is again average. Here are some of the samples taken with the device.. Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro features a 2600mAh battery and this is good capacity for a 5 inch device in the mid-range segment. The phone does give good battery life in normal usage which includes calls, browsing, email, casual gaming and social networking apps. We tested the battery on multiple instances and found that if you are an average user, you can easily get a day or more with the battery on this device.. Priced at Rs 9190, is the Galaxy On5 Pro value for money? It is tough to recommend the Galaxy On5 Pro at this pricing when the competition offers much better devices in the form of Redmi Note 3, Coolpad Note 3 Plus, Le1S and many more. The On5 Pro is an upgrade over On5, but still lacks many features including the TFT display, lack of sensors, lower MP camera and also poor build and design. If you are looking for a Samsung phone below Rs 10,000, then the Galaxy On5 Pro is worth buying, else you should be looking at better options.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Review- The Beast!.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 3.0 out of 5 stars Good Pack but Annoying Software Bugs!. Good Camera, Processor fine, Keyboard is good as per the size, and the phone is handy! All software related problems, bugs are copyrighted to this phone by Samsung I guess. Sometimes it's won't remove the headphone profile even after removing headphone jack, you have to do a lot of hard work to put it back into general outdoor mode if you have by mistake put headphone jack into it. Its gallery will stop displaying videos and when you click on them it will be thrown to some random photo, You might have to reset to get rid off of that. Samsung's annoying notification, no matter what privacy you put, it always comes once in a while in the notification area.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good phone at a cheap price. First of all I would like to thank Amazon for the quick delivery. I ordered the phone on Thursday and got it delivered on Saturday. 6570(including 80rs for delivery within 2 days). So, 5 star for their quick delivery. Now coming to the phone, I bought the Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro for my mother. She is a very basic user and needed a decent phone for her day to day use. So, I searched a phone for her in various online sites. Considering her needs I was not that conscious about a great performer phone that can run heavy apps and games. I was more concerned about a phone with good built quality which would be durable enough to survive a few drops and a phone from a good brand having a good brand value. Hence, I ended up deciding to buy the Samsung On5 Pro after a bit of research. Although there were various choices across the sites of different phones from different brands like Mi, Motorola, Lenovo, Asus, etc. to name a few, but the name Samsung is enough which would require no new introduction. Moreover the availability of service center is a great plus point.Thus due to these points I bought the Samsung On5 Pro for her. The phone have got decent specs like 5 inch HD display(Which fits in hand perfectly unlike the large screened phones available in market), 2 GB of RAM of which 0.9 GB remains free, 16GB of ROM which is expandable to 256 GB through Micro SD Card, really decent cameras (8mp & 5mp), Exinos 1.5 ghz Quad core processor, good built quality and great screen quality,Good battery backup (Although only 2600mah seems to be less on paper but in real life it performs quite well and would survive for a whole day or more depending upon the use.), Moreover it is a decent performer at this price without any notable lags as it handles apps like Whatsapp, FB with ease (Haven't tried any games so can't comment on that) At the end I would like to summerise that someone who is in the need of a good mobile from a good brand and is not a cellphone geek should consider buying this phone if he/she want to get a phone of less price point. For the heavy users and youths like me I would definitely not recommend to buy it and its better go for other phones from brands like Mi, Moto, Samsung's high range phones Lenovo, etc. (But not the phones from brands such as Vivo, Oppo and Gionee as I feel that these phones are over rated due to the advertisement which provides no value for your money wih outdated hardware and software, looks and user interface copied from i Phones. I personally feel these brands are fooling people in he name of look with old hardware which are no value for money).. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Best for average use. I am using it for last one month. Bought it for 6500/- (addition 10% cash back) Pros: 1. Good signal strength for both the sim 5. Best phone for this price 6. Good rare camera in day time Cons: 1. No screen protection (temper glass recommended) 2. Full plastic body, chrome may wear down 3. Touch is not so responsive 4. Power and volume bottoms very hard to press 5. Worst cameras at low light 6. Average display (dull colours, not so good as other smartphone of same price). Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Its A good phone from samsung. Its A good phone from samsung and its been one year i didnt faced any problem. It has got 2gb ram and 16 gb internal storage which is enough. Also i got android nougat update too. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars GOOD PHONE GO FOR IT!!!!!!. I am writing this review after using the phone for around one month. The phone has a very good build up, a very slim and fits to hands perfectly. The camera quality is better as both the cameras gives the decent pictures. Speed is fast as it is powered by 2 GB RAM and the best processor. Battery gives a back up of 1 day after heavy use. No Noughat update for this phone by Samsung. Rest the phone is excellent and is a good choice if someone looking for budget phone. I got this phone at 6999..

Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars A Samsung Basic!. Let's divide this review between Pro's and cons Pro's 1- The build quality is very good, though the back is plastic with a leather like finish, it feels really good in hand. 2- Screen looks good 3- Battery life is amazing, will easily last a day with moderate use. 4- Camera is better than its Chinese competitors. 5- S clean feature is good CONS 1- Touch response is just average, many times you'll find yourself tapping multiple times on the screen for a single task. 2- Not for heavy users, will start lagging! REVIEW If you need a smart phone just for calls and other light tasks like using whatsapp/ Instagram, go for it If you want the most of your 7/8 thousand rupees, look for Chinese brands!.

Home / News / Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro and Galaxy On7 Pro review. Design and Display Camera Software Performance Battery Life Audio Quality Wrap Up Pros Cons Better hardware than any other Samsung device at this price Average performance on the On5 Pro Good battery life Unimpressive rear cameras Respectable selfie cameras Run-of-the-mill LCD displays Latest Samsung software No ambient light sensor Themes support Poor loudspeakers. Last year, Samsung launched the Galaxy On series. of smartphones in the Indian market. Unlike all its other smartphones, the Galaxy On5 and Galaxy On7 were exclusive to online retailers, in a bid to compete with the feature-packed affordable smartphones that Chinese manufacturers were selling through the online-only model. As the On5 and On7 were sold online, Samsung managed to save on costs associated with offline retailers and stores. As a result, the Galaxy On5 and Galaxy On7 had slightly better specs that what were expected from Samsung phones at those price points.. Fast forward to 2016, and Samsung has launched the On5 Pro and On7 Pro, which bring more RAM, storage and an upgraded version of Android. The Galaxy On5 Pro and Galaxy On7 Pro, like their predecessors, are targeted at those who like to be online all the time (hence the “On” in the phones’ names). At roughly $140 and $160, the On5 Pro and On7 Pro offer the best specs Samsung has ever offered in the segment. In fact, the Galaxy On5 Pro is priced lower than the Galaxy J2 (2016), which has abysmal hardware and only has its cool notification ring to boast about .. We have had both new On handsets in our possession for the last couple of weeks; we thought about doing a full review, but given their limited availability and the fact that they are minor upgrades over the original lineup, we’ll be doing a quick one to see how these handsets fare. Don’t worry, we did use these devices as our main phones for a couple of days, and we will just be keeping the review’s word count short.. (2016) and Galaxy On7 (2016) are the actual true successors to the On5 and On7 and were launched as the Galaxy J5 Prime and Galaxy J7 Prime in the Indian market.. The On5 Pro and On7 Pro are pretty similar to their predecessors in terms of design. That is to say there is nothing impressive to be seen. The phones are made of plastic, with a soft touch material on the back for enhanced grip. The back curves at the sides to allow for even better handling, similar to what we have seen on Samsung’s flagship smartphones. Both devices have notable heft but never felt heavy, which is to say their weight feels just right whether you’re using the devices with one hands or two.. Samsung has used 720p LCD panels on both phones, with 5-inch and 5.5-inch-inch displays on the On5 Pro and On7 Pro respectively. These panels are slightly above average in terms of color contrast but are otherwise quite run-of-the-mill.. The On5 has the sharper display here,. as 720p stopped being enough for 5.5-inch screens a long time back. A Super AMOLED panel would have gone a long way in improving the viewing experience, and Samsung is thankfully rectifying that with the Galaxy On8. Brightness levels are quite high, but the lack of auto brightness means you will have to use the Outdoor mode when you’re trying to use the device on a sunny day.. The On5 Pro and On7 Pro have 8-megapixel and 13-megapixel rear cameras, and a 5-megapixel sensor at the front. As one would expect at these price points, the cameras do an unimpressive. The rear camera on the On7 Pro captures slightly more detail thanks to the high-resolution sensor, but even this detail is something you will only notice when you zoom in on a photo. sharp in good lighting conditions, but indoors and in low-light situations there’s a considerable amount of noise and very less fine detail. The front camera on both devices takes nice selfies; they come out a tad soft and dark indoors, but there’s a sufficient amount of detail when there’s enough natural light around you.. The camera app is the same one we have seen on other recent Samsung devices, with the option to launch it quickly by double pressing the home button even when the device is locked. You get regular camera modes like Panorama, Beauty Face and. Burst; the Pro mode offers general customization like white balance, ISO and exposure adjustment and nothing more. There’s no option to shoot in HDR. A variety of effects come preloaded for both front and rear cameras. For selfies, the phones support holding out your palm in front to automatically initiate image capture with a timer, and there’s also a Wide Selfie mode for when you need to fit in more people in your front-facing shots.. The On5 Pro and On7 Pro run Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box, with the latest iteration of Samsung’s TouchWiz interface. You don’t get all the features seen on high-end Samsung devices, but there are a few additional things on top of what Android offers. There’s full support for the Theme Store, so you can change the look of the user interface by selecting from thousands of third-party themes. Other features include S Bike Mode ( check our detailed guide on how it works), Ultra Data Saving Mode for data savings, and Samsung’s advanced power saving modes.. Both the On5 Pro and On7 Pro come with a one-handed operation mode, which downsizes. the entire interface and makes it shift to one side of the phone. The On5 Pro doesn’t really need this option with its 5-inch screen, but it’s a welcome feature nonetheless for those who want to consistently operate the device with a single hand in a particular situation. Smart Manager also comes preloaded for managing memory and storage; you can download Samsung Smart Switch from the Play Store to transfer data from an existing device.. The On7 Pro might have a more pixelated display, but it manages to offer a smoother and faster experience thanks to the Snapdragon 410 chip inside. The Exynos 3475 in the On5 Pro is less powerful and results in animation stutters and some delays in launching apps. Multitasking is fine on both devices thanks to the 2GB of RAM, although gaming performance leaves something to be desired when you try playing any high-end title. Asphalt 8, one of the most optimized high-end games available on Android, is a stutter fest at anything but the lowest graphical setting on the On5 Pro and the medium setting on the On7 Pro.. Thankfully, Samsung has provided 16GB of internal storage, so you can at least install more apps and large games instead of running out of space like you do on other budget Samsung phones. The 2GB of RAM is also welcome and is what keeps the phones from stuttering too much when you’ve been using them for a while and have a few apps running in the background. It’s clear that the online-only sales model lets Samsung refrain from compromising on basic specs like the memory and storage. You also get support for USB OTG for connectivity external storage devices and accessories like mice and keyboards.. Long-lasting battery life was one of the best features of the original On5 and On7, and it has carried over to the Pro editions. The On7 Pro – with its 3,000 mAh battery and low screen resolution – can easily last a day and a half with general usage that involves social media, taking a few photos, listening to music and even going about the day on a 4G connection. The On5 Pro can get you through the day, too, but you will have to charge it overnight. Charging times are nearly 2 hours on both devices thanks to the lack of fast charging support, which means the long battery life becomes an additional advantage.. Audio quality on the On5 Pro and On7 Pro is. The loudspeakers on these devices produce somewhat hollow sound, although the beats come off with considerable depth. The supplied earphones don’t particularly focus on either the lows, mids or highs; the volume levels are high, although your ears can start hurting after a few minutes of listening to music at the highest volume. Oh, and Samsung’s default music player isn’t installed on either device and cannot be downloaded from the Play Store or Galaxy Apps store, so you will have to make do with the pre-installed Google Play Music or a third-party alternative.. Call quality through the earpiece is pretty good, if not really stellar.. For regular Samsung devices, it makes sense that the company can’t offer the greatest of hardware at budget prices. After all, there’s profit to be made, advertising to be done, and funds to be allocated to research and development.. Chinese manufacturers offer smartphones ten times better than Samsung’s offerings at the same prices, but since most of those are only available online, Samsung’s devices give consumers the benefit of walking into any local retail stores to pick one up.. But for the Galaxy On series, which, like the Chinese competition, isn’t sold offline, it becomes a completely different ballgame. Samsung’s smartphones lose all value here, except for when it comes to good after sales support. The Galaxy On5 Pro and Galaxy On7 Pro just don’t have any unique feature that would make us give them a recommendation. Again, after sales support is where these devices will give you peace of mind, but there are just too many Chinese smartphones that are a better proposition for your hard earned money..
