Ponsel pintar asal Negeri Tirai Bambu ini diberitakan akan segera dipasarkan secara global pada 18 Juni 2016 mendatang. Di sisi lain, kehadiran smartphone besutan Oppo yang menyasar pada segmen kelas menengah ini tentunya siap menjadi pesaing smartphone kelas atas garapan vendor-vendor yang lain. Selain itu, sebagai smartphone kelas premium atas, tentunya Oppo A59 tersebut dipersenjatai dengan spesifikasi yang terbilang mumpuni dan hadir dengan gaya desain yang lebih stylish memperlihatkan tampilan aura kemewahan dan semakin memperkuat kesan kelas premiumnya. Selain itu, yang jelas bahwa munculnya Oppo A59 di tengah-tengah persaingan dunia smartphone yang begitu ketat, tentunya akan semakin membuat persaingan kian ketat, terutama pada segmen kelas menengah. Namun, bagi calon konsumen, kehadiran Oppo A59 akan semakin menambah pilihan bagi mereka untuk mempertimbangkan pilihannya.. Terlepas dari hal tersebut, kehadiran Oppo A59 ini pun tentunya dengan membawa spesifikasi yang mumpuni. Mulai dari desain bodinya yang terbungkus dari bahan full metal yang semakin terkesan lebih premium. Lalu, Oppo A59 ini pun juga mengusung layar seluas 5,5 inci dengan resolusi 720 x 1280 pixels dan mengusung teknologi layar IPS LCD sehingga akan memperlihatkan tampilan layar yang lebih memukau dan menarik. Lalu, menginjak pada sektor dapur pacunya, Oppo A59 dibekali dengan chipset MediaTek MT6750 dan prosesor Octa Core dengan kecepatan hingga mencapai 1,5 GHz Cortex-A53 yang tentunya akan memberikan performa kinerja mesin yang lebih optimal. Bahkan, untuk lini fotografinyapun, Oppo A59 ini juga dipersenjatai dengan kamera beresolusi tinggi, yaitu 13 MP untuk kamera utama. Sedangkan, untuk kamera depan menggunakan resolusi 8 MP. Melihat spesifikasi pada sektor kamera tersebut, pastinya tak perlu diragukan lagi bahwa pasti akan memberikan hasil jepretan foto yang jernih dan tampak lebih nyata.

Pasalnya, tidak berbeda jauh dengan beberapa smartphone Oppo sebelumnya di mana Oppo A59 ini memiliki bodi yang terbungkus dari bahan yang berbahan full metal dengan ukuran dimensi 154,5 x 76 x 7,38 mm dan memiliki bobot 160 gr yang menjadikan smartphone ini lebih tipis atau slim. Selain itu, Oppo A59 ini juga memiliki layar yang berbentang 5,5 inci beresolusi 720 x 1280 pixels dengan kerapatan hingga 267 ppi di mana akan memberikan kesan tampilan yang tampak cukup jernih dan jelas. Selain itu, pada sektor layar, Oppo A59 ini juga akan dibekali dengan tipe layar IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen 16M colors sehingga akan menampilkan tampilan yang lebih memukau. Tampaknya, memang spesifikasi Oppo A59 ini sengaja dibuat untuk mengentalkan desain yang stylish dan mewah ala Oppo.. Dapur Pacu Andalkan Chipset Mediatek MT6750 dan RAM 3 GB. Lanjut pada pembahasan berikutnya, kali ini Begawei akan membedah secara detail mengenai sektor permesinan dari spesifikasi Oppo A59. Oppo selama ini memang dikenal sebagai salah satu vendor asal China yang sering meluncurkan smartphone kelas menengah atau premium, termasuk Oppo A59. Pada smartphone terbaru garapan vendor asal Tiongkok tersebut, selain memiliki gaya desain yang stylish dan terkesan premium, tampaknya pada sektor permesinannya juga tak luput dari perhatian. Pasalnya, Oppo A59 ini bakal dipersenjatai chipset Mediatek MT6750 yang akan dikolaborasikan dengan prosesor (CPU) Octa Core 1,5 GHz Cortex-A53 yang pastinya akan menjadikan Oppo A59 ini memiliki sistem kinerja yang cukup gahar. Bahkan, kedua komponen dapur pacu dari Oppo A59 tersebut akan dibekali dengan RAM yang berkapasitas 3 GB sehingga akan sangat mendukung aktivitas multitasking yang lebih responsif dan cepat. Tak sampai di situ saja, untuk tampilan grafisnya, Oppo A59 akan mengandalkan kartu grafis (GPU) Mali-T860 yang pastinya akan memberikan grafis yang lebih menarik, memukau, jernih dan tampak lebih nyata. Kemudian, dapat dipastikan pula bahwa sseluruh spesifikasi Oppo A59 tersebut akan berjalan di atas sistem operasi OS Android Lollipop v5.1 dengan user interface Color OS 3.0.. Dilengkapi Ruang Penyimpanan Longgar dengan Memory Internal 32 GB. Setelah desain luar dan dapur pacu kita bahas secara detail, saatnya kita membahas pada sektor berikutnya, yaitu sektor ruang penyimpanan dari spesifikasi Oppo A59. Oke, langsung saja, untuk sektor ruang penyimpanan dari Oppo A59 ini terbagi dalam 2 kategori, yaitu memory internal dan memory eksternal. Untuk memory internal dari Oppo A59 ini memiliki kapasitas hingga 32 GB. Menengok kapasitas dari penyimpanan internal tersebut tampaknya memang dirasa sudah cukup besar untuk sebuah smartphone kelas menengah. Selain itu, jika memory internal Oppo A59 ini dirasa masih kurang, pengguna bisa menyimpan beberapa file pribadi yang berukuran besar ke dalam memory eksternal yang bisa disisipi micro SD hingga batas kapasitas 128 GB. Nampaknya kedua memori tersebut menjadi bagian penting dari spesifikasi Oppo A59 ini.. Sektor Bidik Membidik Foto Andalkan Duet Kamera Utama dan Kamera Depan. Untuk pembahasan berikutnya, pada sesi ini Begawei akan mengulas secara rinci mengenai sektor fotografi dari spesifikasi Oppo A59. Sebagai smartphone yang hadir dengan spesifikasi kelas premium, tentunya sektor fotografi juga tak ketinggalan mendapatkan perhatian. Oleh sebab itu, Oppo A59 dibekali kamera utama yang memiliki resolusi 13 MP lengkap phase detection autofocus, LED flash yang siap memberikan hasil bidikan gambar atau foto yang memukau dan menarik. Selain itu, untuk kamera depan mengandalkan kamera yang beresolusi 8 MP yang tak akan kalah dengan kamera utamanya mengingat kamera depan dari Oppo A59 bisa digunakan untuk video call dengan hasil yang baik. Di sisi lain, lini fotografi dari Oppo A59 ini juga dilengkapi dengan berbagai macam fitur menarik dan lengkap, antara lain Geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, dan HDR serta panorama yang siap digunakan untuk olah data setiap foto atau gambar yang diambil sesuai dengan selera atau keinginan pengguna. Tak hanya itu saja, spesifikasi Oppo A59 inipun juga bisa digunakan untuk merekam video dengan kualitas [email. protected] yang tampak lebih nyata.. Koneksi Internet Dijamin Cepat Berkat Jaringan 4G LTE. Sebagai smartphone kelas premium, spesifikasi Oppo A59 ini sudah mendukung jaringan 4G LTE sehingga pengguna akan semakin dimanjakan dan berselancar bebas di dunia maya dengan kecepatan akses yang gesit dan handal. Selain itu, Oppo A59 dilengkapi juga dengan beberapa fitur konektivitas, antara lain untuk konektivitas jarak dekat didukung WiFi, WiFi Direct dan Hotspot. Sementara itu, untuk aktivitas transfer data, Oppo A59 dilengkapi dengan berbagai macam fitur, antara lain Bluetooth, port micro USB dan USB Host yang siap mentransfer setiap data dengan akses yang cepat. Tak sampai di situ, saja, untuk urusan pemetaan lokasi, spesifikasi Oppo A59 sudah dilengkapi dengan sistem navigasi A-GPS yang akan memberikan hasil pemetaan lokasi yang cukup akurat.. Suplai Tenaga Disokong Baterai Li-Po 3075 mAh. Nah, pembahasan kali ini merupakan pembahasan terakhir mengenai spesifikasi Oppo A59. Pada ulasan terakhir ini, Begawei akan mengulas bagian terpenting yakni seputar suplai daya baterai yang akan digunakan untuk menghidupi segala aspek operasional dari Oppo A59. Pada sektor suplai baterai ini nampaknya memang telah dipertimbangkan dengan masak. Pasalnya, Oppo A59 ini mengandalkan baterai dari jenis Li-Po (Lithium Polymer) yang memiliki daya kapasitas hingga 3075 mAh. Kapasitas tersebut tampaknya telah sesuai dan dijamin mumpuni untuk menghidupi seluruh spesifikasi Oppo A59 tersebut.. Masih mengusung branding A, Oppo A59 ini bisa dibilang emmiliki nilai A untuk segala aspeknya. Mulai layarnya yang berukuran 5.5 inci yang berteknologi IPS LCD, tentunya sudah dijamin lebih cerah ketimbang layar LCD biasa. Selain itu, untuk urusan performa, ternyata Oppo A59 ini sudah menggunakan Mediatek 6750 yang memiliki 8 inti CPU dengan denyut nadi 1.5 GHz. Kesangarannya masih ditambah dengan benaman RAM 3 GB yang dipastikan akan meluncurkan performanya secara maksimal. Selain itu, sebagaimana jargon marketing Oppo, kamera yang digunakan dalam Oppo A59 ini sudah memiliki ketajaman 13 MP. Walaupun demikian, ponsel ini masih saja iseng dengan menempatkan slot MicroSD sebadan dengan slot SIM Card 2. Artinya, pengguna Oppo A59 ini perlu melakukan pengorbanan terlebih dahulu sebelum menikmati salah satu dari fitur tersebut. Namun, untuk lebih jelasnya berikut Begawei berikan tabel kelebihan Oppo A59 dan kekurangan Oppo A59 ini.. Nah, akhirnya sampailah kita pada pembahasan terakhir di mana pada pembahasan terakhir ini kita akan mengulas tentang harga Oppo A59. Seperti kita ketahui bersama bahwa Oppo A59 ini merupakan smartphone kelas premium dengan mengusung spesifikasi yang canggih. Pertama pada sektor luarnya yang mengusung gaya desain yang tampak lebih elegan dengan layar 5,5 inci beresolusi 720 x 1280 pixels yang tidak diragukan lagi akan memberikan tampilan yang berkelas dan memukau. Apakah tampilan layar tersebut akan sama memukaunya dengan harga Oppo A59. ini? Tunggu dulu! Masih banyak yang perlu dipertimbangkan. Sebagi contoh, pada sistem dapur pacunya, Oppo A59 ini juga disematkan chipset Mediatek MT6750 yang akan didukung RAM 3 GB sehingga kinerja sistem operasional dari Oppo A59 ini akan lebih optimal dan tentunya lebih responsif. Tak hanya itu saja, pada lini fotografinya pun juga tak kalah canggihnya. Pasalnya, sektor fotografi dari Oppo A59 tersebut dilengkapi kamera utama 13 MP dan kamera depan 8 MP yang pastinya akan memberikan hasil jepretan gambar yang lebih memukau. Lantas, dengan spesifikasi yang cukup mumpuni tersebut, berapa ya harga Oppo A59 ini?. Langsung saja, berdasarkan data yang diperoleh dari para intelijen Begawei, harga Oppo A59 ini akan terlebih dahulu dipasarkan di China dengan harga $274 atau sekitar Rp 3,6 jutaan. Selain itu, Oppo A59 ini juga memberikan 2 pilihan warna kepada para calon konsumen, antara lain Gold dan Rose Gold. Hingga saat ini belum ada kabar bahwa warna tersebut memberikan dinamika harga Oppo A59 ini. Namun, yang perlu diperhatikan bahwa Oppo A59 ini telah dirilis di negara China yang menyasar kalangan menengah dan sampai sekarang belum ada informasi mengenai ketersediaan Oppo A59 di pasar global termasuk di Indonesia. Jika melihat segmennya, melalui harga Oppo A59 yang hanya sekitar 3 jutaan seharusnya ponsel ini wajib masuk ke tanah air.. Melihat harga Oppo A59, tentunya akan sangat disayangkan apabila produk bermutu ini hanya terdapat di negeri tirai bambu tersebut. Namun yang jelas, dari kabarnya saja yang sudah menyeruak ke permukaan mampu membuat pasar gadegt menajdi panas. Tentunya, akan menjadi semakin panas lagi jika Oppo A59 ini nantinya diluncurkan secara global. Apalagi, saat ini Oppo disebut-sebut sebagai salah satu vendor raksasa yang setara dengan Samsung dan Apple. Dengan harga Oppo A59 yang berada di kepala 3 juta rupiah, tampaknya kehadiran ponsel ini bisa menjadi sebuah ancaman bagi kedua vendor pesaing terberat Oppo tersebut. Itulah tadi pembahasan mengenai spesifikasi dan harga Oppo A59 yang Begawei sampaikan. GSM 900 / 1800 / 1900 - SIM 1 & SIM 2.
