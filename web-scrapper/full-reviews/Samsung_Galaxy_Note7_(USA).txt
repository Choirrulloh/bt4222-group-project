In an SMS missive from US Cellular obtained by The Verge, Samsung has decided to initiate its firmest measure yet in getting Note 7 users to exchange their phones — by sending out an update that will prevent the device from charging. “THE PHONE WILL NO LONGER WORK,” the message concludes. Since US Cellular is placing the responsibility of this software modification squarely on Samsung, it is likely that the outstanding recalled phones on all other US carriers will get the same update. This goes beyond the pale of limiting the battery’s charge to 60 percent and is closer to what was thought to happen to French Note 7 units — a kill switch. Samsung declined comment on the issue. US Cellular did not respond to a request for comment. **************************************************************** Related Phrases - samsung galaxy usa - samsung galaxy note7 usa specs,features & details,price. unlock gsm samsung galaxy s7 sprint g930p usa. samsung galaxy a9 edge ( usa official trailer ).

Impara come riparare il tuo Samsung Galaxy Note7 con questo video.. Samsung's line of phones-that-don't-fit-in-your-pocket is back! And in a Microsoftian move, they're going from Note5 straight to Note7. On the surface, it looks like an S7 Edge with a bigger screen and a fancy stylus, but we know better: no guts, no glory. Update: We added some sweet X-ray imagery, from our friends at Creative Electron .. Do you enjoy the odd teardown? We’ve got three (way cooler than two) ways to stay up to date with the latest repair news: find us on Twitter , join our inner circle on Facebook , and check out our Instagram !. Questo smontaggio non è una guida di riparazione. Per riparare il tuo Samsung Galaxy Note7, usa il nostro manuale di assistenza .. It's a mix of new and familiar as we peruse the Note7's specs:. Curved panel 5.7" Super AMOLED display with 2560 × 1440 resolution (518 ppi) and Gorilla Glass 5. Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor with 4 GB RAM + Adreno 530 GPU. 12-megapixel, ƒ/1.7 rear camera with OIS, dual pixel autofocus, 4K video; 5-megapixel/1080p selfie camera. 64 GB internal storage, with an additional 256 GB available via MicroSD expansion. S Pen stylus, USB-C, and headphone jack (phew). IP68 dust and water resistance rating. As we boldly go where no tinkerer has gone before, we come across some star ports hiding out near the bottom edge. From left to right we observe:. That last one's not a port at all, it's the illustrious S Pen. Removing the S Pen is as smooth as slicing warm butter.. Building off the Note5's mid-production design modification , the S Pen doesn't fit into its slot backwards. Our teardown hands are itching to get down to business, but we take a moment to test out the S Pen.. First impressions: this stylus stacks up pretty well against Microsoft's Surface Pen and Apple's Pencil .. The S Pen is smaller (and more stow-able) than either, but still has a scan rate of 360 Hz and senses 4,096 levels of pressure compared to the Pencil's 240 Hz and the Surface Pen's 1,024 levels of sensitivity.. In an additional level of customization, the S Pen comes with two interchangeable tips: a soft tip for writing on smooth glass, and a hard tip for use with screen protectors.. If opening stubbornly adhered Samsung devices was an Olympic sport, our teardown room would be filled with gold medals .. We take a minute to stretch while the iOpener works its magic, softening the adhesive under the rear glass.. We fly off the starting blocks, iSclack and opening pick in hand. Pop ! The rear glass dislodges from the chassis. Whoosh ! The rest of the adhesive didn't stand a chance. This is something of a delicate procedure, and we still miss the days of plastic peel off rear cases.. Seeing these good ol' familiar screws draws our focus down to what they're securing: a sweet wireless charging coil.. Samsung states that "once you've had wireless charging, there's no going back. " It's like having the event horizon of a black hole right in your phone, with all the convenience that entails.. We suspect the NFC antenna is also bundled into this wafer-thin assembly. NFC is no stranger to Galaxy Phones .. With that, we get our first full reveal of the Note7. We come across an unusual battery cable design. At first glance, this is most definitely a slide. We're getting a little motion sick just looking at all of those winding curves.. Fortunately for us, a flick of a spudger is all it takes to pry the (off-kilter) battery connector cable off the motherboard.. With battery disconnected we delve deeper.. First victim: the single speaker, with built in antenna.. Of note, the speaker pass-through has a gasket and mesh liner, in addition to the grille punched into the case (likely a waterproofing measure).. Nuova batteria = iPhone più veloce. Kit di riparazione a partire da $16.99. We could almost hear the battery laugh in our faces when we tried to pluck it out bare-handed—but our inner Hulk emerges as we muscle with all the might our spudger can muster.. This 3500 mAh, 13.48 Wh battery is significantly more powerful than the 10.45 Wh one found in the similarly sized iPhone 6s Plus , but it falls just a bit short of its smaller sibling, the Galaxy S7 Edge , which comes in at 13.86 Wh.. Curiously, the Note7's battery is fortified by walls carved from the rear case, providing extra structural integrity, and maybe even some water protection.. Dongguan ITM Electronics Company LTD, interesting that this name never appears in all the news stories about the exploding batteries.. That's because Samsung designs their new phones not to have replaceable batteries. It's starting to seem like a guaranteed way to make (most) people buy new devices every couple of years or so.. Out comes the motherboard, with three little cameras in tow.. Front and rear cameras are familiar fare on smartphones, so what's the third camera for?. That would be the Note7's trick iris scanner. It's actually a two-part system: a nearby infrared blaster invisibly lights up your eye, while the sensor captures an image that's said to be more secure than a fingerprint.. For comparison we have the iris scanner (right) with the Note7's 5-megapixel, ƒ/1.7 selfie cam (left).. And for the X-ray comparison, here we have the two cameras still in the device.. With the motherboard deftly extracted, we take our tweezers to the hefty main camera and line him up for closer look.. It's déjà vu all over again as we pull out what appears to be the same Sony IMX260 -based main camera that we uncovered in the S7 and S7 Edge.. And the similarities go further, all the way down to:. the Winbond Q32FWXGIG serial flash memory. and OIS-enabling gyroscope, likely the next generation of the one found in the S7 Edge. what is the GPS chip this device is using. We're down to the meat and potatoes of this teardown, and it seems like Samsung unified more than their product numbering—this chipset is nearly identical to that found in the S7 and S7 Edge .. Samsung K3RG2G20CMMGCJ 4 GB LPDDR4 SDRAM layered over a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820. Samsung KLUCG4J1CB-B0B1 64 GB Universal Flash Storage 2.0. Avago AFEM-9040 multiband multimode module. Qorvo QM78064 high band RF fusion module, TQF6260 front-end module and QM63001A diversity receive module. Qualcomm WCD9335 audio codec and DSP DBMD4 audio/voice processor. Murata FAJ15 front-end module. More note -worthy chips hide on the backside:. Samsung 3420S7 G707A3 Wi-Fi module (most likely contains a Broadcom Wi-Fi SoC). Qualcomm QFE3100 envelope tracker. Qualcomm WTR4905 and WTR3925 RF transceivers. IDT P9221S wireless power receiver (likely an iteration of IDT P9220 ) + MPB02 603PD9 1625ELn + MAX77838 power IC. Heading south, we hit the modular headphone jack—ready to let the music flow while keeping water out, with a nice sealing gasket.. This phablet ships with an IP68 water resistant rating, meaning it is dust tight, and can survive under 1 meter (or more) of water.. The USB-C port is new to the Note line—and while reversibility is handy, change is hard. Samsung kindly includes a micro-USB-to-C adapter to keep your cables relevant.. Out goes the daughterboard array ! Unlike the one found in the S7 , this board used rigid PCB interconnects. This keeps the spidery cable from being flimsy. If you like tiny heat pipes, Note7 has you covered. This looks like the same "liquid cooling" copper heat dispersal apparatus we pulled from the vanilla S7 and S7 Edge .. Nearby, a note -able amount of glue secures this plastic cover over the S Pen chamber. It's probably there to help ingress-proof the stylus' slot.. We're not normally fans of glue—but this waterproofing effort doesn't seem to hinder repair much.. Inside, a simple clip grabs the S Pen notches, and a gray rubber bumper protects the nib.. The volume buttons look pretty complicated, but that doesn't slow us down. Braced with years of experience plucking our unibrows, we dive in, a pair of tweezers in hand.. First out are the microswitches, followed by a reinforcement bracket full of rubber gaskets. Not quite the same, but similar to another waterproofing approach we've seen.. But...what's this? The button covers are oddly trapped within the outer case. Could this mean the case is double-walled? Is this a waterproofing feature? Perhaps a structural feature? Your guess is as good as ours.. We're down to slim pickings, and the last component to surrender is this front-facing sensor array containing:. IR blaster to enable iris scanning. We saw the iris scanning sensor earlier—this component provides the infrared illumination to really make your eyes pop.. And here's the moment you've been waiting for—the exploded (edit: no pun intended) diagram of the Note7.. Many components are modular and can be replaced independently. Improved cable routing means the charging port board can be removed without disassembling the display. The battery can be removed without first ousting the motherboard, but tough adhesive and a glued-on rear panel make replacement very difficult. Front and back glass make for double the crackability, and strong adhesive on the rear glass makes it very difficult to gain entry into the device. Because of the curved screen, replacing the front glass without destroying the display is probably impossible.. Riparabilità 4 su 10. (10 è il più facile da riparare). would you think its worth upgrading from the s7edge to the Note 7?. I would get the iPhone 7 :). Yeah I would, that stylus is so %#*@ sexy.. For sure, note 7 is a beast of a phone, you wont regret it. Is it possible to keep the water resistance after opening the phone for something simple like battery replacement. I will take my chances with this device to replace my note 4. I just did that and I dont like it.... The screen is not as wide because of the curve. Can you verify whether the phone will support 4x4 MIMO for LTE?. Some versions ll support 4*4 MIMO with qualcomm 820 chipset.. I see no home button :/. MacArthur Lingenfelter -. First picture in step 2 has it. The ones that support 4x4 mimo are the qualcomm 820 ones not the exynos powered note 7s. 4/10 repairability for the Note 7, and 7/10 repairability for the 6S? Come on Samsung, give that corruption money to iFixit so they can give you good scores arbitrarily.... do you even see an open iphone ? or you are just a troll that wants to say anything...I changed my iPhone screen without any knowledge about phone repairing.... dude iphone 6s doesn't have adhesive to open the phone, so yeah they have higher score in that.. beside see iphone7 which has a lot of adhesive for protect from water and dust. I wouldn't call going from Note 5 to Note 7 the same as what Microsoft had to do. Do you realize how many websites and web based software apps rely on OS detection? It would make all the systems looking for windows9x break, badly. Samsung just want their version to start matching to help prevent confusion with the consumers.. Is it possible to see what brand the fingerprint sensor is?. Can this phone make a call from Ireland to Northern California? What about from Portland, OR to Portland, ME??. Yes and yes, if you have international calling.. Anyone k now if taking off the back cover messes up the waterproofing in any way? On my Note 5 I took the back cover off (very easy) and was able to repaint it a nice black with no logos and also put in small pieces of tin paper so it stuck on my magnetic car holder. But I'm hesitant to remove the Note 7 back. The process looks as easy as the Note 5, but I'm afraid of ruining the waterproof design.. Is it possible to tear down the iris scanner? How many lenses does the iris scanner have?. The Power Management is MAX77838 not MAX77830. I think you're right, good catch! Thank you!. Unfortunately they've all been recalled because of exploding batteries...... Well the note 7 battery explodes. It reads "Li-ion battery" on the battery label, so is it actually Li-ion cell using liquid EL or Li-polymer cell?. Because ifixit is a website of USA.... how about a tear down for the replacement unit?. I would get the note 7. So I wanna buy a Galaxy Note 8. Did anybody try using external lipo battery with this device (or even a few 18650 cells in 4p1s configuration) :-)?. (instead of internal combutible one), or just slot in 1.5 AH 20C cell from the RC lipo pack instead of 3.5AH combustible one?. If coupled with good BMS circuit it would make this device safe instantly :-).. Perhaps you can add a battery from a different Samsung phone. Or only fast-charge from the wall and place the charger on a timer, 15m on and 15m off to prevent battery heating.. And something Samsung can do with the people that refuse to turn over their phone is to ask them politely if they want battery logging data stored on the phone to help find the cause of the problem, turn it into a research project (using a new app I guess). This would prevent their next phone doing the same thing. The app could send a SOS (known from the phone’s rising temperature) and the collected data as the phone is combusting if it is WIFI/4G connected at the time. If the problem is found, the recall could be halted if it can be solved with a software patch (even if it is a battery problem – although liion tech is susceptable to insulation peircing from crystal growths in the battery and that is not avoidable).. when's the date of this teardown article?. It's so challenging to translate these articles, so only English and French versions of iFixit are available, and there's much less contents in French version..
