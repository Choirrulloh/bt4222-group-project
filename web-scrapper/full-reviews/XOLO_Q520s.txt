Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 19.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min).

Mobiles / XOLO Mobile Phones / XOLO Q520s Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 5 Launch Date in India: 06 January, 2015 Compare. When even the best of smartphone makers can commit mistakes, then why penalise those who are pretty new to the market? When we look back at 2014, we feel Xolo brought to us some great smartphones in budget and mid-range smartphone segments. So, when it brought out the Q520S, we thought as to what kind of a smartphone Xolo brought to us. It seems the Q520S is here to accomplish different goals than what may seem to us. As far as the hardware of the Xolo Q520S goes, it sports a 1.3GHz quad-core processor which is accompanied by 512MB RAM. There is Android 4.4.2 KitKat on Q520S and it comes alongside the capability of the smartphone to handle two SIM cards. As far as storage space goes, the Xolo Q520S has 4GB internal capacity and it can be expanded up to 32GB with the use of a microSD card. Display-wise, the Q520S has a 4-inch screen and it throws out 800x480 pixels resolution. On the photography front, there is a 5-megapixel camera on the back of Xolo Q520S and it is accompanied by a 0.3-megapixel front-facing unit. Lastly, all this hardware on Q520S is powered by an 1820mAh battery that has been rated to last for 19 hours of talktime. The Q520S feels overpriced as far as the specs and its competitors go. With almost every spec to be the same, you can save a cool few bucks by not opting for the Q520S. But the offering from Xolo does make us stop for a second and think whether that would be the best thing to do. While the Q520S does not seem worthy of the price premium that Xolo markets it for, there is the flip side to the scenario. The flip side states the Q520S does everything better than its rivals and that is what justifies the price premium. What we can say is that you need to be either a fan of Xolo or a tech guy to opt for the Q520S.. 6,499 .00. 4,499 .00.
