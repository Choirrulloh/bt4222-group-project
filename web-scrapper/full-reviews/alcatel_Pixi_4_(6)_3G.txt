Alcatel Pixi 4 6", toda la información. Recibe un email al día con nuestros artículos:. Compartir Alcatel Pixi 4 6", toda la información. Alcatel Pixi 4 6”, precios y disponibilidad. Los Pixi 4 fueron los equipos elegidos por Alcatel para llenar su espacio en la pasada edición de la feria CES y hoy vamos a hablar del grandullón de la gama, el Alcatel Pixi 4 6” , o dicho de otro modo, su phablet de gama de entrada.. La experiencia visual es primordial en este equipo, por eso en Alcatel lo han dotado de una enorme pantalla de 6 pulgadas que lo pone en el límite de la manejabilidad y es que, por más que se empeñen las marcas, los móviles tan grandes no son fáciles de manejar con una mano. Estará disponible en una versión 3G con especificaciones ligeramente más modestas y un modelo 4G más completo.. El Pixi 4 6” lo apuesta todo al tamaño de su pantalla, mientras que el perfil técnico queda relegado a un segundo plano con características como 1 GB de RAM y Android 5.1 Lollipop para el modelo 3G.. Enorme, así es el Alcatel Pixi 4 6”. Monta una pantalla IPS de 6 pulgadas en diagonal con resolución HD , combinación que da como resultado una densidad de 245 ppi. La configuración no es para tirar cohetes, pero tampoco se le puede pedir más a un teléfono de su gama.. Alcatel ha apostado por un diseño de esquinas redondeadas muy sencillo, que combina un frontal en tono negro cubierto de cristal, con una carcasa trasera en acabado oro o plata. Las dimensiones se quedan en 165 x 83,8 x 8,3 milímetros para el modelo 4G, que alcanza un peso de 186 gramos , mientras que la versión 3G tiene un perfil de 7,9 milímetros y consigue reducir hasta 180 gramos.. Ver galería completa » Alcatel Pixi 4 6" (6 fotos). Los teléfonos de antes tendían a miniaturizarse, pero el juego cambió con los smartphones. Ahora el tamaño importa cada vez más, y el Alcatel Pixi 4 6” es un claro ejemplo. Sin embargo, todo tiene un límite y ha quedado demostrado que las pantallas de 6 pulgadas no siempre son un acierto. Aunque, para ponérnoslo más fácil, el Alcatel Pixi 4 6" cuenta con una función que reduce la pantalla para que podamos alcanzar bien todos los botones cuando lo usamos con una sola mano.. En el punto medio está la virtud, dicen, y la prueba está en que la mayoría de marcas prefieren moverse en torno a las 5/5,5 pulgadas. Con todo, los móviles de gran formato tienen su mercado y este en concreto tiene un precio muy atractivo que le podría hacer destacar en el escaparate, pero eso lo veremos más adelante.. Como ya hemos adelantado, el Alcatel Pixi 4 6” viene en dos versiones. El modelo 3G es el más modesto en especificaciones con 8 GB de capacidad interna, 1 GB de RAM y un chip Mediatek MT8321 (un cuatro núcleos a 1,3 GHz). Por su parte, la variante con conectividad 4G sube a 16 GB de ROM y 1,5 GB de RAM, con un procesador Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 (cuatro núcleos a 1,1 GHz).. El sistema operativo es otra de las diferencias. El Alcatel Pixi 4 6” 4G sale de serie con Android 6.0 Marshmallow, pero su hermano pequeño 3G sale con Android 5.1 Lollipop y tiene pinta de que la cosa se va a quedar ahí. Por más que lo intentamos, no le vemos sentido a eso de lanzar una pareja de móviles al mismo tiempo y que uno de ellos venga con una versión que data de octubre de 2014. La fragmentación del sistema es un problema inherente en Android , pero sería un error echarle toda la culpa a Google cuando las marcas siguen haciendo cosas como esta.. Por lo demás, ambos modelos comparten el resto del perfil técnico, con una batería de 2.580 miliamperios que soporta 5 horas de vídeo, una pareja de cámaras de 8 y 5 megapíxeles respectivamente, las dos con flash LED, opción de ampliar la memoria a 64 GB adicionales usando tarjetas MicroSD y opción Dual SIM. Pero mejor que contarlo, vemos los detalles en una tabla:. Modelo 4G: 165 x 83.8 x 8.3 mm y 186 gr. Modelo 3G: 165 x 83.8 x 7,9 mm y 180 gr. HD 1.280 x 720 píxeles, 245 ppp. Modelo 4G: Snapdragon 210 Quad-core (1.1 GHz Cortex-A7). Modelo 3G: Mediatek MT8321 Quad-Core (1.3 GHz Cortex-A7). Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, Hotspot. Trasera: 8 MP con AF, flash LED, filtros Polaroid y vídeo FullHD. Frontal: 5 MP con flash LED. 5 horas de reproducción de vídeos. Alcatel ha diseñado este dispositivo pensando en los más jóvenes, usuarios que buscan un equipo amplio y solvente, pero no disponen de un presupuesto muy holgado. El Alcatel Pixi 4 6” 3G ya está disponible por 129,9 euros , un precio muy competitivo que como decíamos es un punto a su favor a la hora de destacar entre otros androides del escaparate. Por cierto, el modelo 3G sólo se vende en color dorado.. Para el modelo 4G se puede elegir entre acabado dorado o plata y su precio es de 169,9 euros en formato libre, pero en este caso tendrás que esperar a junio para hacerte con él..
