HTC Launches the One M9+ Supreme Camera Edition. by Joshua Ho on September 29, 2015 4:51 PM EST. HTC One M9+ Supreme Camera Edition. MT6795 2.2GHz 8xA53 MediaTek Helio X10.

Today, HTC launched the One M9+ Supreme Camera Edition. The rather verbose and mildly surreal name probably gives away what this phone is, which is a variant of the One M9+ with some significant changes to the camera. The spec sheet below should give a pretty good idea for what to expect.. As you can see, the big change here is the camera. Instead of the 2.1MP secondary camera, HTC has added an IR laser rangefinder for short distances, which should dramatically speed up auto-focus in low light and macro shots. The sensor is now a Sony IMX230 with phase detect auto focus, so in conditions with good light it should be possible for the sensor to traverse straight to in-focus instead of bracketing the in-focus point with contrast detection. However, the optical characteristics are unchanged from the One M9 and M9+ with an f/2.2 aperture likely to keep edge distortions under control. OIS is also added to improve low light performance for still photos and improve video stability.. The One M9+ Supreme Camera edition will go on sale in Taiwan on October 6 th for $630 USD in gunmetal grey and two-tone silver/gold. This is likely to remain an Asia-only variant, although we may see a similar camera in future devices.. Please log in or sign up to comment.. danbob999 - Tuesday, September 29, 2015 - link. ??? They added only 1MP to the camera? From 20 to 21? Or is it an error in the table?. olafgarten - Tuesday, September 29, 2015 - link. I think the main changes are the OIS, Laser Auto Focus and a new sensor. mczak - Tuesday, September 29, 2015 - link. Dude, it's not about the megapixels - it could have less than the "old" version and still be much better. Albeit I'm not sure it's really worth a new device for just a different camera - while AF should be better (faster) and OIS is always nice I don't think the old camera was particularly bad. danbob999 - Tuesday, September 29, 2015 - link. I know I just expected a bigger difference on a "supreme camera edition" phone. NXTwoThou - Tuesday, September 29, 2015 - link. I read the headline and thought "Smart move, coming out with a Lumia 1020 spiritual successor three days before MS reveals their non-successors to it". icrf - Tuesday, September 29, 2015 - link. While they are improvements, they're not nearly as significant as the model name suggests. EddyKilowatt - Tuesday, September 29, 2015 - link. PDAF and OIS are the new hotness and will deliver more usable shots under conditions of marginal light or excessive motion. But the real determinants of image quality are still numbers they're not publishing (dynamic range and SNR) or things that can't be reduced to a number (quality and "artfulness" of the image processing chain). SeventyFive - Wednesday, September 30, 2015 - link. You would consider adding megapixels an upgrade?? I actually expected them dropping the pixel count in half, or nearly in half while upping the sensor size in order to up the pixel size. And the fact that the pixel size stayed the same or even gotten smaller, I see nothing but IR & OIS as a real upgrade to the camera and not really a truly "supreme" upgrade. LordConrad - Wednesday, September 30, 2015 - link. I would much prefer 8 or 10 Ultrapixels with OIS. damianrobertjones - Tuesday, September 29, 2015 - link. The Nokia 1020 needs an update.

HTC One M9+ Supreme Camera and Butterfly 3 Launched. Gadgets 360 Staff , 29 September 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. HTC on Tuesday made its HTC J Butterfly (HTV31) available for markets outside Japan with a new moniker - HTC Butterfly 3. Notably, the device was launched in Japan back in May this year , and the international variant is identical in terms of specifications. The Taiwanese company also launched the HTC One M9+ Supreme Camera , which is almost identical to the One M9+ smartphone but with a few upgrades in the rear camera setup.. The HTC Butterfly 3 runs Android 5.0 Lollipop, sports a 5.2-inch QHD (1440x2560 pixels) IPS LCD3 display, and is a water and dust resistant device with IPX5/ IPX7 and IP5X certification. It runs on 64-bit octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 MSM8994 (quad-core 2GHz + quad-core 1.5GHz) SoC coupled with 3GB of RAM and Adreno 430 GPU. The smartphone comes with 32GB built-in storage and supports expandable storage via microSD card (up to 2TB).. The handset sports a 20.2-megapixel rear camera with dual-LED flash, while it also houses a 13-megapixel front-facing camera. Notably, the Butterfly 3 also sports a dual rear camera setup.. It supports 4G LTE connectivity apart from Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS/ A-GPS, GPRS/ EDGE and 3G connectivity options. The HTC J Butterfly (HTV31) or the Butterfly 3 comes with a 2700mAh battery, which is same as the one found on HTC J Butterfly launched last year. The Taiwanese company notes that the smartphone also features Qualcomm Quick Charging 2.0 tech. The smartphone would be launching in Taiwan on October 20 with a price tag of TWD 19,900. The global availability and price details are yet to be known.. Moving on to the HTC One M9+ Supreme Camera, the smartphone shares all the same specifications with that of HTC One M9+ except the new laser autofocus system and better rear camera. The new variant now features a 21-megapixel autofocus rear camera with OIS and an f/2.2 aperture. It still boasts a dual-lens design but now the secondary rear camera on top acts as the laser autofocus system. The front-facing UltraPixel camera remains unchanged. For reference, the One M9+ includes a 20-megapixel shooter (f/2.2) rear camera with the secondary camera acting as the depth-sensor.. The handset features the same 5.2-inch Quad-HD (1440x2560 pixels) display and is powered by 2.2GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6795T Helio X10 processor coupled with 3GB of RAM. The inbuilt storage on the device is 32GB, which is further expandable by a microSD card (up to 128GB). It is also backed by a similar 2840mAh non-removable battery.

HTC - HTC + Android - Android +. The revised HTC One M9+ Supreme Camera Edition has been benchmarked on AnTuTu. Unveiled earlier by HTC along with a version of the HTC Butterfly 3 for Taiwan, the device keeps the specs of the original HTC One M9+, which is to say that it has a 5.2-inch screen , and a 1440 x 2560 QHD resolution. It also features the MediaTek MT6795 SoC under the hood, with an octa-core 2.2GHz CPU and the PowerVR G6200 Rogue GPU. 3GB of RAM is inside, along with 32GB of native storage. Those requiring additional memory can turn to the micro SD slot. A 2840mAh battery keeps the power on. Where the handset is vastly improved is with the rear-facing camera, which now has a 21MP sensor (vs. More importantly, the camera adds OIS to eliminate the shaky videos that often take place when recording on a smartphone. Also added is phase-detection autofocus, plus laser AF. The front-facing camera remains the same 4MP Ultrapixel camera that used to be on the back of the HTC One (M7) and HTC One (M8). The phone is going to be available in Taiwan starting on October 15th, priced at the equivalent of $630 USD. A run through AnTuTu resulted in a score of 51,336 for the revised handset, which is a pretty good score. Compare that to the 40,698 allegedly scored on AnTuTu by the upcoming mid-range HTC One A9. Powered with a Snapdragon 617 SoC and carrying 2GB of RAM, this model is expected to be unveiled on October 20th and feature Android 6.0 pre-installed. Thanks for the tip! source: TechGrapple.

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. HTC One M9+ Supreme Camera Edition detailed with 3x kinds of AF. Chris Burns - Sep 29, 2015. Smartphone maker HTC reveals the HTC One M9+ Supreme Camera Edition with three forms of autofocus in a feature called “3-in-1 fusion focus”. This system replaces the secondary camera present on the last couple HTC One releases with a laser autofocus. This device also has phase detection and traditional autofocus, as well as optical image stabilization (OIS). This is all coupled with a dual-LED flash and a 21-megapixel camera at its back. Other than its camera, this device is largely the same as the HTC One M9+ as previously revealed.. The camera system on this device combines its three autofocus technologies to bring what HTC suggests is focus speeds as fast as 0.1 second. With the already well-made front and back-facing camera suite on HTC’s devices released over the past several months, we’ll be looking forward to checking the quality on this machine sooner than later.. Beside the “Supreme Camera” nature of this device, the specifications of the One M9+ remain the same. This device has a 5.2-inch QHD display (that’s 2K), as well as 32GB internal storage and 3GB of RAM. This device has a MediaTek MT6795T Helio X10 SoC inside and a 2,840 mAh battery, as well as a pair of front-facing BoomSound speakers.. For now this device’s release will be limited to Taiwan. HTC’s Senior Global Online Communications Manager Jeff Gordon suggests that although this device is for Taiwan only, we should still assume HTC will have “more news later today.”.

HTC Debuts One M9+ 'Supreme Camera' Version With 21-Megapixel Shooter: Here's The Deal. 30 September 2015, 12:05 am EDT By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times. HTC just announced a new version of its One M9+ smartphone: the "Supreme Camera." This updated model comes with a more powerful 21-megapixel shooter and additional camera features.. Just hours before Google's big Nexus launch, HTC took the stage at its own September 29 event and introduced a new Butterfly 3 smartphone for China and a new camera-centric version of the HTC One M9+.. The HTC Butterfly 3 is essentially the HTC J Butterfly that launched in Japan earlier this year, while the new HTC One M9+ Supreme Camera targets photography enthusiasts.. As the name itself suggests, the Supreme Camera version of the HTC One M9+ basically brings a camera update to the existing model. The updated version now boasts a larger 21-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization (OIS) and laser auto focus. The smartphone retains the dual-lens layout for the rear shooter, but the upper camera is now the laser auto focus system instead of a secondary camera. The HTC One M9+ Supreme Camera also sports phase detection which, combined with the laser AF system, should deliver blazing-fast focus speeds of 0.1 seconds.. Aside from the changes in the camera department, the HTC One M9+ remains virtually unchanged compared to the original model, as all other hardware specs are the same.. This means that the smartphone features a 5.2-inch QHD display (2560 x 1440), an octa-core MediaTek MT6795T Helio X10SoC, 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal storage and a 2,840 mAh battery. Other highlights include a fingerprint scanner embedded in the home button and front-facing BoomSound stereo speakers.. HTC is also expected to launch an upgraded camera app to go along with the updated One M9+ Supreme Camera version. The smartphone, meanwhile, should hit retail in Taiwan on October 6, sporting a price tag of roughly $630. It remains to be seen when or if this model will make it to other parts of the world as well.. Recent rumors suggested that HTC might unveil its highly anticipated One A9 (Hima Aero) smartphone at its September 29 event, but the handset was notably absent. The company may be saving the announcement for a later date to avoid competing with Google's Nexus announcement.. HTC , HTC One M9 Plus Supreme Camera , smartphone camera , Photography.

Information about the type and size (form factor) of the SIM card used in the device.. Information about the number of SIM cards, supported by the device.. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) was developed to replace the analog cellular network (1G), therefore it is referred to as a 2G mobile network. It has been improved with the addition of General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and later via the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology.. TD-SCDMA (Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access) is a 3G standard for mobile networks. It is developed as an alternative to the W-CDMA standard in China by the Chinese Academy of Telecomunications Technology, Datang Telecom and Siemens AG, and combines TDMA and CDMA.. UMTS stands for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System. Based on the GSM standard, it is deemed as a 3G mobile network standard. It has been developed by the 3GPP and its major advantage is the provision of greater bandwidth and spectral efficiency, due to the W-CDMA technology.. LTE is deemed to be the fourth generation (4G) of mobile communications technology. It has been developed by the 3GPP based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies in order to increase the speed and capacity of wireless data networks. A further development of the technology is called LTE Advanced.. There are several network technologies that enhance the performance of mobile networks mainly by increased data bandwidth. Information about the communication technologies supported by the device and their respective uplink and downlink bandwidth.. Information about the operating system used by the device as well as its version.. Name and version of the user interface (UI) used by the operating system (OS).. The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. The frequency is the clock rate of the graphic processor (GPU), which is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. RAM (Random-Access Memory) is used by the operating system and all installed applications. Data in the RAM is lost after the device is turned off or restarted.. Information about the type of RAM used by the device.. Information about the number of RAM channels integrated in the SoC. More channels mean higher data transfer rates.. RAM frequency relates directly to the rate of reading/writing from/in the RAM memory.. Information about the capacity of the built-in storage of the device. Sometimes one and the same model may is offered in variants with different internal storage capacity.. The various types of memory cards are characterized by different sizes and capacity. Information about the supported types of memory cards.. One of the main characteristics of the display is its type/technology, on which depends its performance.. In mobile devices display size is represented by the length of its diagonal measured in inches.. The ratio between the long and the short side of the display. The display resolution shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical side of the screen. The higher the resolution is, the greater the detail of the displayed content.. Information about the number of pixels per centimeter (ppcm) or per inch (ppi) of the display. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed and clearer is the information displayed on the screen.. The color depth of the display is also known as bit depth. It shows the number of bits used for the color components of one pixel. Information about the maximum number of colors the screen can display.. The estimated percentage of the screen area from the device's front area.. Information about other functions and features of the display.. Sensors vary in type and purpose. They increase the overall functionality of the device, in which they are integrated.. Information about the manufacturer and the model of the image sensor used by the camera of the device.. Digital cameras use image sensors for taking photos. The sensor characteristics are some of the main factors determining the quality of the camera integrated in the mobile device.. Information about the dimensions of the image sensor used in the device. Usually cameras with larger sensors and less pixel density tend to provide better image quality despite the lower resolution.. A smaller pixel size allows the image sensor to use more pixels thus providing better image resolution. On the other hand, this may negatively impact noise levels and decrease image quality at high ISO settings.. Crop factor is the ratio of the dimensions of a full frame camera's sensor (36 x 24 mm, which equals the frame size of a 35 mm film) and the dimensions of the image sensor of the device. The number shown is the ratio between the diagonals of a full frame sensor (43.3 mm) and the device sensor.. Aperture (f-stop number) indicates the size of the lens diaphragm opening, which controls the amount of light reaching the image sensor.
