CNET también está disponible en español.. Nothing could be simpler than this one-track cheapie. The Good The Nokia 215 is ultra-affordable and immensely pocketable. FM radio and a camera are useful extras on such a basic phone.. The Bad Since the 215 only works on two bands, you won't be able to use it everywhere in the world.. The Bottom Line There's no need to hold back from buying this cheap, simple Nokia 215, which does exactly what it promises.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Design and build The Nokia 215 comes in white and black as well as this screaming green. Navigation and apps There's a flashlight up top, a useful addition. Being told you have a one-track mind isn't usually a compliment, but that's the Nokia 215's entire reason for existence. It's a phone whose primary objective is to make calls and it costs just $30, which translates to £19 or AU$35, not including tax. The barriers for success for this kind of handset are ridiculously low: achieve good call quality, have sturdy construction, be cheap.. Unfortunately, the 215 isn't a truly global device because it only works on the 900 and 1,800MHz bands, frequencies found predominantly in parts of Asia and Africa, as well as the Middle East and Europe. The phone may also get signal in select countries in Latin America, but not North America. It will work in the UK and Australia, but it's unlikely to be widely available there as it doesn't even have 3G, let alone 4G LTE.. Folks in the regions where it does go on sale could use the 215 as a starter device they can give to kids or elderly people, out-of-town visitors, or simply keep as a spare if they don't want it as their primary device. There's definitely room in the market for the most basic of handsets.. $30 Nokia 215 lasts a month (pictures). Design-wise, the Nokia 215 has just about everything you'd want in this type of phone: a short, thin profile and sturdy build. It measures 4.6 inches tall by 2 inches wide by 0.55 inch thick (116 by 50 by 12.9mm) and weighs just 2.8 ounces (78.4 grams).. The back pops off to reveal the battery and microSD card slot within, but apart from that, the 215 has a sturdy polycarbonate plastic build that tucks easily into pockets and purses. Rounded edges make it easy to palm and carry around. The slippery, matte finish isn't a problem for a phone this small and easy to contain in one hand.. A 2.4-inch screen with a 320x240-pixel resolution adorns the face; and I do mean basic. It does support 262,000 colors, which is admittedly better than black and white. You navigate through two soft keys and a four-way directional pad you can press down on to select. There are a few other keys on the alphanumeric keypad you should know, like the power/end button and one to silence the phone. The buttons themselves are rubbery and responsive.. You will find a camera on the back; it's the most basic resolution, a 0.3-megapixel lens. There's no flash, but there is a flashlight (torch) up at the top, next to the 3.5mm headset jack and Micro-USB charging port.. In keeping with Nokia's modern use of neon colors, you can get the 215 in bright green; otherwise, it comes in two more sedate shades, white and black.. The proprietary OS is dead simple to get around. The Go To soft key can launch a few features, like the camera or flashlight. For more apps, the Menu button pulls up your call log and contacts, along with apps for your music player and alarm clock. The Opera browser will load pages slowly over 2G and compress data and images to accommodate the slower speeds.. You'll find a messaging app as well, and the ever-useful FM radio. For entertainment, there are a few apps and games you can download through the app store. Microsoft makes its presence known in the Bing search tool you find preloaded. Separate apps let you view your photos and videos, and you can pull up the weather through a dedicated program.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News.

The first Microsoft-branded Windows Phone rolls out: The unremarkable Lumia 535. [ Further reading: The best Android phones for every budget. So Microsoft’s new $29 Nokia 215, a Series 30 phone that runs Facebook, Messenger, and Twitter is what, a phone of Homer Simpson-like intelligence?. No, Microsoft’s new Nokia 215 isn’t anything to write home about. But since you can access the Web via its Opera Web browser, you can email your parents and send them a picture.. Unfortunately, Microsoft chose the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to announce a phone that Americans won’t likely see. The Nokia 215 will ship initially to the. Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Europe in the first quarter of 2015, Microsoft said, at just $29 before taxes and subsidies.. Compared to a phablet, the Nokia 215 is. Some of the specs, however, are admirable. Charge it once, for example, and the single-SIM variant will remain in standby for 29 days, according to Microsoft. The dual-SIM version has a standby time of 21 days. Talk time is up to 20 hours, with MP3 playback up to 50 hours. Microsoft didn’t quote more modern metrics, such as the time the phone can stay powered up while surfing on 3G, or playing back videos. That’s not part of the phone’s vision.. The phone itself is relatively tiny, hearkening back to the old days of candybar Nokia phones. It measures just 116 mm long by 50 mm wide by 12.9 mm deep, and weighs just 78.65 grams, or 2.77 ounces. Nevertheless, there’s a 2.4-inch QVGA screen, so surfing the Web is going to be at least tolerable. There’s even a camera, although Microsoft didn’t disclose the resolution of it.. Nevertheless, it’s not quite a dumb phone, either. Yes, you can surf the Web, and access Facebook and Facebook Messenger—even with notifications. Twitter, which was designed from the get-go for SMS-like communications, works too. The Nokia 815 isn’t for modern smartphone lovers, and that’s okay.. Microsoft still has a strong legacy business in emerging markets, where the Nokia brand name still carries cachet. (The phone is branded Nokia, with no Microsoft logo.) In those markets, what the Nokia 215 can do is perfectly suitable for the task at hand.. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed..

How Microsoft's $29 Nokia 215 Could Actually Sell More Windows Phones. Microsoft likely hopes that getting users hooked on Facebook, Twitter, Bing, and other apps will encourage them to eventually upgrade to low-end Windows Phones.. Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) recently unveiled the Nokia 215, a smarter "dumbphone" that will launch for just $29 in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe in the first quarter of 2015. Although the Series 30 phone is powered by bottom-end hardware, it comes loaded with Web apps like Facebook , Facebook Messenger, Twitter ( NYSE:TWTR ) , Opera, Bing Search, and MSN Weather.. According to Microsoft's announcement at CES, the Nokia 215 will come in single and dual-SIM versions, have a talk time of 20 hours, play MP3s for up to 50 hours, and last 29 days on standby. Microsoft didn't disclose how long the 215 lasts for 3G browsing or video playback.. The Nokia 215 might not initially seem like a major device for Microsoft, but it actually reveals a lot about its long-term mobile strategies.. Why the Nokia 215 matters People often forget that Nokia's handset division, which Microsoft acquired last year, remains the second-largest cell phone manufacturer in the world after Samsung ( NASDAQOTH:SSNLF ). However, most of the division's sales were generated by Nokia's low-end feature phones instead of Lumia Windows Phones (which Microsoft rebranded as its own last year).. Last year, Microsoft discontinued its Nokia X Android phone and the low-end Asha Series 40 smartphones to clear the way for lower-end Windows Phones to enter emerging markets. While many people believed that Nokia-branded feature phones would also be discontinued, Microsoft kept the business alive and launched the $25 Nokia 130 last September.. However, the Nokia 130 was as spartan as a phone could be -- it lacked a camera or 3G connectivity, and its only "extra" features were a Bluetooth antenna, an FM radio, a media player, and a microSD card slot. The 130 might generate a little extra pocket change for Microsoft, but it didn't fit into the company's low-end Windows Phone strategy of tethering more users to its mobile ecosystem.. Therefore, selling the Nokia 215 for just $29 represents a way for Microsoft to wean more "dumbphone" users onto "smarter" feature phones with Web connectivity. Microsoft likely hopes that getting users hooked on Facebook, Twitter, Bing, and MSN apps can encourage them to eventually upgrade to low-end Windows Phones.. The shrinking business of feature phones Between the third quarters of 2013 and 2014, Microsoft Mobile (Nokia)'s global handset shipments fell 23% from 64.6 million units to 49.8 million units, according to Counterpoint Research. That decline will likely accelerate as lower cost smartphones render feature phones obsolete. In 2013, Gartner reported that smartphones outsold feature phones globally for the first time in history.. Feature phone shipments are declining, but their margins are surprisingly decent. IHS iSuppli estimates that the Nokia 105, which launched for $20 in 2013, was sold with a hardware and manufacturing margin of 29%. Therefore, it makes sense for Microsoft to milk those profits before the feature phone market completely dries up.. Leaping from platform to platform However, it would be foolish to let the feature phone market simply dry up without converting some of those users to the Microsoft ecosystem.. The first step is to launch Microsoft's Bing in developing and emerging markets via phones like the Nokia 215. Net Market Share currently ranks Bing as the second-largest search engine in the world,. of the global search market compared to Google 's 66%. If Microsoft introduces Bing to first-time smartphone users with Bing-powered feature phones, that market share could keep rising.. The second step is to bridge the price gap between feature phones and smartphones. That's why Microsoft recently launched the cheapest Windows Phone ever, the $81 Lumia 435, which undercuts Google's Android One devices. and Samsung's new India-only Tizen Z1, which each cost around $100.. An uphill battle Looking ahead, the odds are still stacked against Microsoft in the smartphone market. Windows Phone only accounted for 2.7% of smartphones worldwide in 2014, down from 3.3% in 2013, according to IDC. That tiny market share causes many developers to bypass the platform, which convinces consumers to buy iOS and Android devices instead.. However, smarter Nokia-branded feature phones like the Nokia 215 could help Microsoft carve out a reputation in developing and emerging markets, which might increase dependence on Bing as a default search engine and fuel fresh Windows Phone sales..
