What is a hands on review?. The K10 looks is a serviceable smartphone. It doesn’t do anything that really makes it standout, but it offers the features you’d want from a mid-to-low tier device in a package which is highly usable, if not a looker.. Early verdict New year, new tech – check out all our coverage of CES 2017 straight from Las Vegas, the greatest gadget show on Earth. LG’s K series is back with an updated selection of mid-to-low range phones, and the LG K10 is the most premium of the line-up for 2017.. It boasts a 5.3-inch HD display, 1.5GHz octa-core processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, microSD slot, 13MP rear camera, 5MP front snapper and a removable 2,800mAh battery.. Design wise the K10 has an all plastic build, but a metallic effect border does at least give it a little bit of premium appeal – pick it up though and you’ll be well aware this isn’t a flagship device.. The noticeably plastic finish isn’t really much of a problem, and it feels solid in the hand – you can also pick between black, grey and gold finishes.. It’s nice to see a fingerprint scanner on the rear of the K10, as the digit reading tech continues it proliferation down the tiers and into more affordable handsets.. In the hand the fingerprint scanner is in an ergonomic location, but place the LG K10 on a flat surface and you can’t access the scanner – forcing you to pick it up. It’s a little frustrating, but not the end of the world.. The scanner doubles as the power/lock key too, with the volume key located on the left side of the handset – falling nicely under thumb or finger.. The HD display is bright and clear, although the 720p resolution isn’t going to blow you away.. On screen you’ll find Android 7 Nougat – the latest version of Google’s software – skinned with LG’s overlay which sees the removal of the app draw by default.. It can be enabled in the settings though, if you don’t fancy dealing with all your apps on home screens.. The K10 runs smoothly, but it lacks the slickness of more expensive handsets and apps don’t load as quickly as some rival devices. It’s not slow though, and still very usable.. The rear facing 13MP camera is a solid offering and during our brief time with the K10 on the LG booth at CES 2017 we were able to take a couple of decent snaps – it won’t blow you away, but it’s a capable snapper.. Things are a little more interesting round the front with the wide-angle 5MP camera. It was an ultra-wide 120 degree field of view, allowing you to cram in more buddies to your selfies.. You can easily switch between this wide view and a normal portrait mode at the touch of a button in the camera – perfect when you’re having a solo pout session.. Removable batteries are a rare thing in today’s smartphones, but LG is one of the few manufacturers which continues to allow users to easily pop their phone’s power pack out – and that’s exactly what you can do with the LG K10.. Under the peel-away plastic rear of the K10 you’ll find a 2,800mAh battery which we hope will be good for a day’s use on a single charge – but you’ll have to wait for our full review to find out.. Also behind the plastic back is the SIM slot and microSD slot – and the latter will likely be required as the K10 comes with 16GB of internal storage and a fair chunk of that will be filled up by the Android system.. The K10 can support microSD cards up to 2TB in size, so you can easily get yourself enough storage.. There’s currently no information on the LG K10 release date and price, but we’re hoping for an attractive price tag otherwise the K10 may struggle to really make a mark.. The LG K10 looks to be a serviceable smartphone. It doesn’t do anything that really makes it standout, but it offers all the features you’d want from a mid-to-low tier device in a package which is highly usable, if not a looker.. The K10’s success however will hinge on its price tag – too high and it’ll find itself losing out to better, cheaper opposition.. What is a hands on review?. 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 32 GB + MicroSD. View all photos (7). Low pixel density screen (277 ppi). The LG K10 2017 is equipped with a 5.3-inch HD screen, 1.5 GHz MediaTek octa-core processor, 2 GB of RAM, 16/32 GB of storage, 13-megapixel main shooter and 5 MP wide-angle front-facing camera.. OS: Android (7.0), LG UX UI. Dimensions: 5.85 x 2.96 x 0.31 inches (148.7 x 75.2 x 7.99 mm). Weight: 4.87 oz (138 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass, Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Effects. Features: Continuous autofocus, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 1500 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 4.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 4.2 days (100 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 7, 8, 20. Data: LTE-A Cat 6 (300/50 Mbit/s), HSDPA+ (4G) 42.2 Mbit/s, HSPA, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: NFC, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS..

I would recommend this mobile,just has good as the Samsung Galaxy range.... Rated 5 out of. I was pleasantly surprised with this phone. Coming from an iphone didn't know what to expect, very surprised and pleased with this phone much better than iphone loaded with features easy to use and much much better than previous androids I've had in past. Well done LG, my wife has one too and she is very pleased.. Rated 3 out of. The handset is a low end device and could not expect anything great, it was a complete disappointment that the back camera did not have a wide angle option like the front does, the images are just acceptable, have seen worse, the good points is I have yet to experience any lag anywhere on the handset, its fairly fast, the sound is a bit low, and the volume buttons are not in the best place, the screen is another good point, not bad for a low end handset! the battery is acceptable, the case is cheap plastic, I would want LG to offer an update to get a wide angle effect for the back camera and give this handset Dolby for music support like they did back in the day for the LG Optimus 3D.. Rated 5 out of. Only downside is it could do with a better battery.. Rated 2 out of.

Florian Wimmer ( translated by Mark Riege), 04/17/2017. Android ARM Touchscreen Smartphone. The LG K10 (2017) brings considerably more power than its predecessor and provides an even better quality casing. A polished performance for slightly over 200 Euros (~$217), but of course we will take a more careful look at the smartphone in the test.. Update: New build brings general improvements and security updates.. Â» Multimedia , Â» Gaming , Â» Lightweight Gaming Â» Budget Office , Â» Business , Â» Workstations Â» Subnotebooks , Â» Ultrabooks , Â» Convertibles. Top 10 under 300 Euros , Â». Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here .. The LG K10 gets a successor, just as LG reissues its complete K-series as affordable entry-level smartphones. The LG K10 (2017) is again the most expensive and best-equipped device of the series. For a price of a little over 200 Euros (~$217), it brings LTE, a wide-angle selfie camera, and a fast processor. At the time of testing, the smartphone can be purchased on the Internet far below its suggested retail price. Therefore we use smartphones that you can currently get for between 150 and 220 Euros (~$162-238) for our comparison: the Samsung Galaxy J3 for example, the HTC One A9s , the Asus ZenFone 3 Max with a large battery, and the Lenovo Moto G4 Play .. Update 08-22-2017 : The new build NRD90U brings general improvements and increases the security. Please refer to the Software section for detailed information.. Update 12/03/2017: a new firmware brings general improvements and improves security. Details can be found in the Software section.. Test device courtesy of LG Deutschland.

There is still just a plastic casing in modest black or a little more daring rose-gold. Only the earpiece grill, the ring around the camera, the bottom edge of the smartphone, and a small band around the casing are colored. However, especially because of this sparing use, the rose-gold coloring looks very premium. The 2.5D glass on the front has remained, so the edges also seem to continue to curve around the corners, where a gap to the frame weakens this effect. Just as in its predecessor, the rounded form results in a very ergonomic smartphone that lies comfortably in the hand.. At 138 grams (~4.8 oz), the LG K10 (2017) became 2 grams lighter compared to the predecessor. The smartphone is also lighter than the other smartphones in the comparison. The silhouette was also slimmed considerably at 7.99 millimeters (~0.32 in), but there is still a removable battery and removable back. Talking about the back: it is now smooth, but there is a discreet stripe pattern that looks very sophisticated. Aside from a standby button, the controls on the back have also now been removed.. The stability is okay, but pressure on the back and front quickly becomes visible in the liquid crystal of the screen. Moreover, the smartphone can be twisted a little. However, an overall impression of a rather high quality remains, especially considering the price.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Like its predecessor, the LG K10 (2017) is also not a dual-SIM smartphone. 16 GB memory storage and 2 GB RAM are no surprises in this class, but the. prove that in the meantime more storage can also be had at this price. The storage can be extended via microSD card, which can also be used as internal storage. However, when using it as removable storage, apps cannot be moved onto the storage card.. Bluetooth 4.2 is supported, a standard that is quite current and furthermore the LG K10 (2017) can communicate via NFC like its predecessor before.. Bottom: USB port, 3.5-mm audio port. LG installs Google's current Android 7 operating system on the smartphone and overlays it with its own user interface. At the time of testing, the current software version was installed, and the security patches were from February 1, 2017 and therefore fairly current. Other than the quite useful Evernote app, there are no third-party apps on the smartphone in the delivery condition, so no bloatware or advertising either. However, LG installs its own app store called "LG SmartWorld," which can be used alternatively to the Google Play Store but offers the same content. Data can be transferred to another device, or a local backup can be created via LG Backup.. LG's own launcher changes the structure of the settings by ordering them into categories. There is no separate app drawer that provides an overview of all apps, but the apps end up on several home screens that are placed next to each other. The notification center looks different as well and is also controlled differently. LG's own apps for telephone, SMS, and email are installed. However, overall the LG K10 (2017) can be operated without problems by anybody who has held a smartphone in their hands before.. Update 08-22-2017 : LG distributes the OTA update to build version NRD90U (version: V10g-APR-20-2017, 521 MB). It is supposed to improve "user friendliness and functionality of the phone". The manufacturer does not describe details however. Google's security patches as of 04-01-2017 are implemented.. Update 12/03/2017: LG has released firmware V10I-SEP-27-2017 (203 MB) with general improvements and Googleâs security patches as of 09/01/2017.. Anyone who pays 200 Euros (~$217) for a smartphone can assume that their device includes LTE capabilities at this point. The LG K10 (2017) does not disappoint here, either. Like its predecessor, it offers four GSM, four UMTS, and five LTE frequency bands. The maximum download speed has increased: data can now be downloaded via LTE at up to 300 MBits per second. In inner-city areas, the reception is good inside as well: we had mostly a 4/5 signal strength at least in the well-established German Vodafone net.. In terms of WLAN, you have to be content with 802.11 b/g/n, as the less congested 5-GHz band will not be accessible. The transfer rates are in the expected ranges, so they are okay. shows that considerably faster speeds are possible. The reception is strong near the router, but the page rendering is fairly slow. At a 10-meter (~33 ft) distance and through three walls, the reception remains good at 4/5 of the signal strength, but the pages render quite slowly here as well..

When activating the GPS module of the LG K10 (2017), our location is not found when inside. Outside, the signal is sufficiently strong to locate us down to six meters (~20 ft) - an average result.. We took the LG K10 (2017) on a bike tour to check the precision of the GPS. Also in our gear: the Garmin Edge 500 professional navigator, which serves as our reference device. On the 12-kilometer route (~7.5 miles), the measured distances differ by 400 meters (0.25 miles), which is a slightly higher deviation than usual. Yet, the LG K10 (2017) does not perform badly: though some corners are cut, and the device does not always place us on the exact path, all in all, the location is more exact than with some other comparison devices. The predecessor could score here before as well.. The telephone app was reworked by LG, but overall offers a similar structure to Google's standard app, with tabs at the top for each function and a large key area. Something special: Optionally, a mini-version of the app can be placed floating on the start screen, the function is called "QSlide.". On our side, the call quality is decent, that is to say, through the earpiece our conversation partner can be heard clearly, intelligibly, and without greater disturbances. However, the microphone of the LG K10 (2017) produces considerable distortions in the voice, so that our partner has to live with a rather moderate voice quality. At least we are able to speak with a quiet or loud voice and the microphone still transfers the voice always intelligibly. In hands-free mode, the call quality decreases considerably on our side: our partner's voice sounds thin and tinny. The microphone has trouble when we speak with a low voice, and our voice still sounds unnatural to our conversation partners. Overall, calling on the LG K10 (2017) is passable, but the microphone has a rather poor quality.. On the back of the LG K10 (2017) is a 13-megapixel camera without any spectacular technical highlights. It does not need them: under normal light conditions, the camera takes good pictures with accurate colors and decent sharpness even in enlargements. Details such as distant trees seem very muddy in enlargements; here higher quality camera modules such as in the. Otherwise, we can recommend the camera for photographs, as long as the light conditions are right: In dark situations the camera brightens too little, a strong noise becomes apparent, and the autofocus does not work right anymore as well.. LG's camera software offers many adjustments and filters (which are treated as different film material); you can activate an HDR mode and take pictures per voice command.. Videos can be recorded with the main camera in Full HD. The exposure adjusts quickly and without apparent steps to the new situation. However, we often had to readjust the focus, and the image appears quite dark. In addition, colors could be a little more vibrant.. The 5-megapixel front camera offers a 120-degree wide-angle lens. In dark areas, color reproduction, sharpness, and dynamic are quite decent. The camera can take good selfies, where you can choose between a wide-angle and narrower perspective. Optionally, if you hold the smartphone still, look into the camera and smile, the LG K10 (2017) can take a selfie automatically or triggered by gesture.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. Under laboratory conditions with controlled exposure, the back camera also shows good sharpness of the details. Text in front of a colored background is always sharp; the edges do not appear quite clean, however. While the sharpness decreases slightly on the edges of the image, it is still good. However, the colors appear a little dull, the photo of the. ColorChecker card shows a slightly spotty representation in many tones, and many color tones are clearly brighter than in the reference image.. We displayed the original color in the bottom half of each patch.. With the included power supply, charging cable, and earphones, t he LG K10 (2017) offers a conventional accessory package. LG's website does not offer any specific accessories.. The manufacturer offers a 24-month warranty on the smartphone and six months on the battery.. Although the standby button on the back suggests a fingerprint sensor, it is just an ordinary button. The LG K10 can only be unlocked with ordinary methods such as PIN or password, and by a KnockCode, a sequence of knocks where the pattern is simply tapped on the screen. This can also encrypt the smartphone.. The touchscreen is very precise, including into the corners. The menu keys are displayed on the screen and can be hidden when necessary. As is the convention, the volume rocker is on the case side, however here it is on the left side instead of the right as on most smartphones.. The keyboard was developed by LG in-house, but other keyboard apps can be downloaded and installed anytime. There is a separate number row, and the language can be switched quickly. The keys are doubly occupied, which makes them a little more cluttered. The keyboard height can be adjusted variably up to some limits. Swipe input is possible as well. Pressing the volume buttons twice with switched-off display will trigger specific functions: Volume Up starts a note function and Volume Down, the camera.. At 1280x720 pixels, the resolution of the IPS display exactly matches the standard for this class. T he brightness is in mid-field a t 350 cd/mÂ²; the. Asus ZenFone 3 Max , for example, glows considerably brighter. The brightness distribution is slightly uneven at 85%, which visibly illuminates large color areas unevenly.. 332 cd/m² 366 cd/m² 338 cd/m² 338 cd/m² 384 cd/m² 348 cd/m² 328 cd/m² 362 cd/m² 351 cd/m². 85 % Center on Battery: 384. cd/m²) ΔE Color 6 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 5.9 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display.

At 1067:1 the contrast is also good; however, the HTC One A9s. once again has a clear advantage. The colors on the display give the impression of a good balance between vibrant and natural.. The detailed analysis with the spectral photometer and the CalMAN software shows a pronounced blue tint. However, the LG K10 (2017) offers a so-called "Comfort mode" for the screen, which removes the blue spectrum from the image. But then the display appears with a strong yellow tint. The deviations of the color values in comparison to the reference sRGB color space are also of average height, but with blue colors, the deviations are especially strong. The color coverage of 71.4% is not particularly high; colors that cannot be displayed must be replaced with similar color tones. Note though, that the CalMAN measurements of the color-space coverage are not particularly exact but show more of a tendency, which in this case is obvious, however. Thus you should not rely on this display too much when judging colors, for example in photographs..

Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Outside, the display is very reflective and the mediocre display brightness often makes it difficult to recognize anything on the screen. The brightness sensor works quite reliably and selects a high brightness outside.. The viewing angles are very good, the screen content can be seen from wide angles, but slight shifts in brightness are visible.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Most games run fluidly, even if they are more demanding. A fluid 30 frames per second cannot quite be reached in. run without stuttering and do not present any problems. Since the control via touchscreen and position sensor works very well, gaming on the LG K10 (2017) is quite fun.. Under load, the casing temperature of the LG K10 (2017) reaches a maximum of 41.3 Â°C (106 Â°F). The area of the back camera especially heats up while the rest of the back remains noticeably cooler. In the front, it is mostly the center area that warms up. During idle operation, the temperatures are considerably lower, in parts by more than 10 Â°C. There is thus a noticeable warming, but it does not become uncomfortable or critical.. During the stress test with the battery benchmark of GFXBench, we cannot discern any throttling of the CPU and GPU, so apparently even during longer load the full power remains available.. 39.6 °C 40.1 °C 35.1 °C. 39.2 °C 40.1 °C 35.6 °C. 37.2 °C 37.7 °C 33.8 °C.

The small speaker on the back has the problem that it can be covered up when the smartphone sits on a table and especially on a soft surface. Even if it can project freely, it does not have a particularly powerful sound: While the maximum volume is still okay at over 84 dB(A), the sound must do completely without bass, and we always have the feeling that the music or voice comes from far away. So the sound is not direct, and during maximum volume, it seems like we hear a slight booming. Even if we cannot expect much in this price range, most of the comparison devices offer a sound that is at least slightly better than the LG K10 (2017).. The sound output via Bluetooth and the 3.5-mm headphone port is good. The included earphones sound reasonable but possibly might not fit all ears.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 45 25 25.4 40.6 31 25.3 34.9 40 32.9 31.8 50 33.6 32.8 63 31.6 32.5 80 28.4 28.2 100 27 28 125 20.8 28.8 160 22 27.8 200 21.3 25.5 250 20.8 26.6 315 21.2 26.6 400 19.4 36.2 500 19.5 43.3 630 17.7 50.4 800 17.9 57.4 1000 17.8 64.8 1250 17.3 71.9 1600 17.4 75.3 2000 16.7 76.7 2500 17.2 76.5 3150 18.2 73.7 4000 17.9 72 5000 17.6 68.3 6300 17.7 66.9 8000 17.8 69.9 10000 17.9 67.3 12500 18.1 60.2 16000 18.2 54.7 SPL 30 84.3 N 1.3 48.9 median 17.9 LG K10 2017 median 60.2 Delta 1.3 17.9 27.6 28.8 27.6 26.6 26.4 26.6 25.7 26.3 25.7 27.7 25.1 27.7 27.9 24.8 27.9 22.8 25.4 22.8 24.2 23.2 24.2 27.1 23.5 27.1 36.9 30.9 36.9 35.1 20 35.1 41.5 19.9 41.5 46.9 21.7 46.9 53.1 24.2 53.1 55 21.2 55 56.4 21.1 56.4 57.6 17.9 57.6 59.3 20 59.3 62.5 20.4 62.5 67.9 18.1 67.9 68.4 14.8 68.4 70.5 16 70.5 72.9 14.9 72.9 74.8 14.4 74.8 75.2 13.9 75.2 72.2 13.3 72.2 67.9 12.8 67.9 68.8 12.9 68.8 58.3 12.9 58.3 50.6 13.2 50.6 44.9 12.8 44.9 82.6 29.2 82.6 48.7 1.2 48.7 median 58.3 HTC One A9s median 17.9 median 58.3 10.8 3.6 10.8 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

NOTE: Due to the curved-edge screen of the LG K20 Plus, our screen protector is made to be smaller(~1/8th inches) than the actual screen of your device.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 2.0 out of 5 stars Far from ideal for the LG K20+. Review for LG K20 Plus phone. The screen protector has two failings. First the screen protector size is woefully inadequate. Top to bottom it is a little short but workable. But left or right it is significantly not wide enough to cover the screen. This results in an insufficiently protected surface area but more importantly (so far) it means that if you try to click or drag something on the edge of your phone's screen, you have problems with half your finger being on the screen and half being on the screen protector. Moving or dragging things becomes more problematic at times. Second, the clarity diminishes as you tilt the screen front to back or side to side away from perpendicular from your face. I don't know if it's an issue with the thickness or what but it's harder to see at different angles.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars NOT for LG K20 Plus Phone. I agree with the other reviewers ... it does NOT fit the LG K20 Plus screen.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Did not fit the LG K20 plus. 1/8 inch to small both sides.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Will NOT fit K20 phones!. Don't buy this for a K20 phone. Seller says screen protector is smaller due to curved screen. It is way smaller than the curved edge. It only partially covers the app icons on the sides, so you can't drag or use the touch screen effectively along the sides.. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Short sided, but still effective.. Great glass, but as previous reviewers stated, it is very short sided. There's easily a quarter inch of the screen of your phone exposed all the way around. Even with a case on there's a significant edge of unprotected screen. However, the glass is very good, goes on simply, and does protect your phone. It takes a bit of getting used to because you can clearly see it and it's a bit of a distraction at first. But, it does cover the displayed area meaning that when you're viewing a web page, playing a game, or managing documents, you aren't looking at a display that projects beyond the edge of the screen protector. Glass goes on much easier than film in my opinion. After cleaning your screen and clearing it of lint, peel off the backing and, keeping your fingers only on the very edge of the protector, line it up by "hovering" over the phone's display and ease down one end to the phone face, then, the other end, and with your finger, press and smooth it down from left to right. If there are bubbles, they easily smooth out simply by rubbing them to the outside edge. 5/15/17 I added a photo to show the edge of the glass vs. the edge of the phone, and this phone has an Otter box case.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Says perfect fit for my LG K20 actually is 1/4" too .... Says perfect fit for my LG K20 actually is 1/4" too short. We'll see how well it protects but is cumbersome when you use the outer edge of your screen.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Does not fit Tmobile LG K20 Plus. They get 1 star for shipping. Unfortunately for me, their description is inaccurate since it DOES NOT fit the Tmobile LG K20 Plus phone. Its too short and not wide enough to protect the entire screen. I should have read the reviews before I purchased.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars DOES NOT FIT K20 as advertised. This product is advertised for the new LG K20V phone, but it only fits the smaller K10. Purchase this at your own risk. Suggest you wait until stores have them to check size physically before you buy.... Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Where for Iphone. Not sure what kind of phone this fits but its way to small in all dimensions, cut-outs for the camera and ear peice are on point just to small for k20 plus. 2.0 out of 5 stars Was not for a LG k20 Plus. 3.0 out of 5 stars Three Stars.

LG K10 (2017) looks slightly better than its predecessor thanks to 2.5D curved glass and metal frames. Technology Tech Reviews LG K10 (2017) review: Wait… what’s. LG K10 (2017) looks slightly better than its predecessor thanks to 2.5D curved glass and metal frames. I didn’t not like the design of LG K10 (2017). Even with metallic frames and 2.5D glass design, the phone failed to impress me in terms of design, especially when I look at competition like Moto G5 , Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and Lenovo K6 Power. LG K10 (2017)’s review unit came with smart cover, which now has an Indianised design, and looks great. Battery is another area where LG K10 (2017) lags. LG K10 (2017), on the other hand, comes with just 2,800mAh battery, which is a disappointment given the price point. The smartphone has a plastic removable back and though it doesn’t look cheap, we expected a lot better on the design front. The power button in LG K10 (2017) now doubles as a SOS button when pressed thrice.. Updated: May 16, 2017 5:45 pm. MWC 2018: LG V30S ThinQ with AI features and 6GB RAM. announced LG K8 (2018), K10 (2018) mid-end smartphones launched ahead of MWC. 2018 LG ‘Judy’ flagship phone to feature 6.1-inch MLCD+ display, likely to launch in. LG is back with a mid-budget device – the K10 (2017). The smartphone is a successor of LG K0 (2016), which was priced at Rs 13,500. The new K10 has undergone a few changes in terms of design, though the price remains nearly the same. LG has added Indianised prints on the smart cover to make it look more stylish, which now comes in several colours.. The power button in LG K10 (2017) now doubles as a SOS button when pressed thrice. The new phone runs Android 7.0 Nougat of the box. Previously, LG launched its K7 smartphone along with the K10 as well. However, the company has not revealed plans to bring K7 (2017) to India.. LG K10 (2017) looks slightly better than its predecessor thanks to 2.5D curved glass and metal frames. The smartphone comes with a bigger battery and runs Nougat. However, the rest of the specifications remain the same. We reviewed LG K10 (2017) for a week, and here’s what we thought of the smartphone.. Specs: 5.3-inch HD in-cell display | MediaTek MT6750 octa-core processor | 2 GB RAM + 16 GB storage space | 13 megapixel rear and 5 megapixel front camera | 2,800 mAh battery| Android 7.0 Nougat OS | dual-SIM with 4G, VoLTE support. LG K10 (2017)’s review unit came with smart cover, which now has an Indianised design, and looks great. The cover has a textured back, which makes the phone less slippery and easy to hold. However on its own, the K10 is slippery, so a cover is must.. The smart cover displays calls and notifications from apps on a horizontal strip. It is pretty convenient to use, as it allowed us to answer calls or switch off the alarm even with the cover closed. However, with the cover on, I faced problems accessing volume rocker keys which are present on the left side of the phone.. The rear camera produces good results when used in bright outdoors. The colour reproduction is fairly accurate, and images appear sharp as well. In low-light, pictures tend to have a lot of noise with missing details. Also, it is quite difficult to focus in low-light with rear camera.. The front camera, just like Oppo F3, comes with a group selfie mode along with the usual single selfie mode. It comes with strong beautification filters, something you realise as soon as you open the front camera app. The soft glow can be reduced to zero to click normal, real life selfies. There are other filters as well. Even in well-lit outdoors, the selfies lack detail and appear grainy, though the colour reproduction is good.. LG K10 (2017) is good with multitasking. You can easily work with 10-15 tabs open at any given time and switching between them is easy as well. I didn’t face app crashes or lags during the review period. However, the phone starts to get warm starting upper back within 3-4 minutes of playing graphic heavy games like Asphalt-8.. Just like its predecessor, the K10 (2017) comes with a host of handy customisations, which I like. Some include the ability to set up to five on screen navigation buttons on the home screen and capture option in the drop down menu that allows for taking quick notes. Additionally, it comes with SOS button that lets you send distress messages to pre-set contacts by pressing the power button thrice.. I didn’t not like the design of LG K10 (2017). Even with metallic frames and 2.5D glass design, the phone failed to impress me in terms of design, especially when I look at competition like Moto G5, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and Lenovo K6 Power. The smartphone has a plastic removable back and though it doesn’t look cheap, we expected a lot better on the design front.. Battery is another area where LG K10 (2017) lags. LG K10 (2017) comes with just 2,800mAh battery, which is a disappointment given the price point. Plus, it takes three hours or more to fully charge the smartphone.. The display in LG K10 looks washed out, and colours don’t look so great either. I had to turn the brightness levels to maximum to view the display in bright outdoors. This is a bit of a letdown given a lot of smartphones in the same range offer a Full HD display.. The fingerprint scanner is not the quickest I’ve come across in a smartphone. It took me at least two to three attempts with the sensor, almost every time I tried to unlock the phone. Plus, if you are a new LG user, you might take a little time getting used to the power button at the back.. LG K10 (2017)is hard to recommend given there are a lot better options in the same price range. For Rs 13,000, you can easily get a bigger battery, Full HD display, and definitely a better design (that’s subjective though) in a smartphone. For instance, there’s Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, Moto G5, Lenovo Vibe K5 Note or even Honor 6X that offers a dual rear camera setup means that for LG K10, convincing potential buyers will be very hard..

Florian Wimmer ( translated by Mark Riege), 04/24/2017. Android ARM Touchscreen Smartphone. The 2017 LG K8 is a little more affordable, a little smaller, and less powerful than the LG K10. But is it perhaps the better deal for all those who are just looking for an affordable smartphone? We find out in our test.. Update: A new build version brings general improvements and security updates..

In its K series, LG combines an affordable price with decent cameras, a removable battery, and an appealing design. This worked well in the LG K10 (2017) , and now we take a look at the slightly smaller, slimmed down sibling, the LG K8 (2017). Besides the smaller display size, it is equipped with a slower LTE module, weaker processor, and less working memory, but currently costs around 50 Euros (~$53) less on the Internet than his better equipped sibling, the LG K10 (2017). At first glance, there seems to be no difference in the cameras.. Asus Zenfone Go ZB500KL , Gigaset GS160 , Huawei Y6 II Compact , and Lenovo K6. are used, which are all within a price range between 140 and 200 Euros (~$150-214). We did not have the predecessor, which is also called LG K8, in our test laboratory, but it is still widely available as well. Is the slightly more expensive 2017 model worth buying, or can you save the extra charge? Or, should you perhaps put a little more money on the table to get the LG K10 (2017) ? We clarify those questions in our test.. Note that in the US, the LG K8 (2017) is currently only available from US Cellular ($50 prepaid).. Update 08-22-2017 : The new build NRD90U brings general improvements and increases the security. Please refer to the Software. Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 Qualcomm Adreno 308.

Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. As in the LG K10 (2017). before, we can attest that the smaller sibling has a good-quality plastic case that sits in the hand ergonomically. Despite its smaller dimensions, the LG K8 (2017) brings slightly more weight to the scale and is also minimally thicker than the. LG K10 (2017) , though at 8.1 mm (0.32 in) it is still quite slim. There are two case colors: Titanium and Gold. However, these relate only to the color of the back and the frame, the front is always black. In our test unit, the back can be removed and the battery can be exchanged. This is not completely unusual in this price class, but in the Lenovo K6 , for example, the battery cannot be removed.. The smartphone can hardly be warped, but it creaks when we try. The front and back are quite pressure sensitive; even with light pressure we can see waves forming in the liquid crystal display..

With its 1.5 GB of RAM, the LG K8 (2017) is similarly on a good level, even though nowadays there are many devices with 2 GB. With USB-OTG, the relatively current bluetooth 4.2, WiFi Direct, and NFC, the list of features is quite comprehensive for this price class. Although a fingerprint sensor is nowadays often praised as a highlight in this class, the LG dispenses with it.. In addition, the storage can be expanded, that is to say, via microSD card. The manufacturer specifies up to 32 GB, but in our test, a 64 GB card was also recognized, therefore it must be a question of marketing, rather than an actual limit.. It is good that LG bets on the current Android 7 even for an affordable smartphone. The security patches are from January 1, 2017, and with that are not really that current anymore. At the time of our testing, an update was not available, and in affordable devices it is rather unlikely that the manufacturer will still deliver on that. LG does not use stock Android, but installs its own user interface, which is different in some details and offers some extended functions, such as the knock-code for unlocking, and slightly expanded setting options.. There are several pre-installed apps that support the management of the smartphone and provide extended functions. LG subsidizes the affordable price by installing a few apps, like Facebook, for example. However, since these are just three apps, we can live with that.. Update 08-22-2017 : LG rolls out an update with build number NRD90U (version: V10e-EUR-XX, 673 MB). The manufacturer summarizes the changes with improved "user friendliness and functionality of the phone". Google's security patches as of 06-01-2017 are implemented.. Although the SoC supports WLAN 802.11ac, with the LG K8 (2017) you have to be content with 802.11 b/g/n. In our WLAN standard test, the LG K8 (2017) achieves customary results and its reception is even a little faster than most comparison devices. In no way does it reach the excellent transfer rates of the Asus Zenfone Go ,. Subjectively, all the pages are loaded quickly near the router, and even when scrolling, images hardly need to be reloaded. A ten-meter distance and three walls between the smartphone and access point, however, are giving the LG K8 (2017) some noticeable trouble: Although the reception is still decent at 3/4, the pages load noticeably slower, and when scrolling, the pictures are often not displayed for a long time, until they are finally reloaded.. The LG K8 (2017) supports LTE, which nowadays is standard even on cheap smartphones. The maximum speed that can be reached is slower than the LG K10 (2017) : 150 MBit/s for download and 50 MBit/s for upload. However, even these speeds are just theoretical and in most cases the network cannot reach anywhere near that, so that a speed difference probably will not be noticeable. The reception is decent, inside inner-city buildings we always had at least half the signal strength in the well-established German Vodafone net..

In enclosed buildings, the location detection by satellite doesn't work. Outside however, we are quickly located with a precision up to 9 meters, which is only an average result. In our bike-tour with the LG K8 (2017) and the professional Garmin Edge 500 navigator, we notice many inaccuracies in our location detection: Often there is just a straight line if locating is not possible for a while, or we are placed clearly off to the side of the path. During navigation, you should therefore not rely to much on the precision of the smartphone.. The Telephone app was slightly adjusted by LG, but mostly corresponds to Google's standard app in terms of functions.. The call quality is surprisingly good and better than on the LG K10 (2017). as well: The earpiece clearly transmits the voice of our conversation partner, and the microphone is sensitive and even transmits words spoken in a lower voice well. However, when speaking in a loud voice, it easily becomes slightly distorted. Our partner is also clearly understandable in hands-free mode, and our voice is also transmitted well, even when speaking in a low voice.. With a 13-Megapixel camera on the back, there is camera of similar quality than the in the LG K10 (2017) , at least on paper. There, we were positively surprised by the sharpness of the image, and also here on the LG K8 (2017), the sharpness is passable, although the autofocus concentrates too much on objects very close to the camera even when they are on the edge of the image, so that the main motif that might be further away becomes blurry. Here you need to manually readjust when necessary. This is unfortunate, since otherwise the color reproduction is ok, and in the area of the focus, the image sharpness is good. In low light the images of the main camera quickly become very grainy and thus appear blurry. Videos can be recorded in Full HD. The quality is good: Even in darker areas the details are still recognizable; the exposure adjusts quickly to new conditions; only the focus needs to be manually readjusted from time to time.. The front camera offers 5 Megapixels and takes quite sharp pictures. The exposure is good as well, but in lighter areas the detail gets lost quickly. The front camera can also record Full HD videos, and the quality is right here as well: The sharpness is good; the exposure adjusts quickly; and the dynamic is decent.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. After testing the main camera under controlled light conditions in our test lab, we can call the sharpness of the images "good." Here, the focus is right as well, since the image has only one depth level. However, text in front of colored background is always accompanied by slight colored edges and on the edges of the image, the sharpness is clearly lower. Colors are reproduced a little on the bright side.. The reference color is depicted in the bottom half of each field.. In contrast to the LG K10 (2017) , the K8 does not include earphones. A charger and USB cable are off course included. The LG website does not offer any special accessories for later purchase.. The manufacturer offers a 24-month warranty for the LG K8 (2017).. The virtual keyboard was developed by LG and is good to write with. Anyone who prefers Google's standard app or another keyboard can download that without any problem.. The touchscreen can be controlled from the corners and edges as well. The menu buttons can be found on the screen, but can optionally be hidden. The hardware buttons are on the left side of the case (volume controls) and on the back, below the camera (standby button). The location is a little unusual, but after a short time of familiarization feels intuitive. There are many accessibility options for people with limited senses, and the volume buttons can trigger special functions on long press, such as starting the camera.. With the 1280x720 resolution, the 5 inch IPS display is right on the level of its class. shows that more can be done and offers even a Full HD screen. In our test unit, the average brightness was 351 cd/mÂ² and with that exactly on the level of its larger LG K10 (2017) sibling. This is clearly too low, and the competition nowadays is far ahead with values beyond 450 cd/mÂ². The brightness distribution is very even at 93%, so that large color areas are illuminated uniformly.. 361 cd/m² 359 cd/m² 334 cd/m² 356 cd/m² 358 cd/m² 343 cd/m² 348 cd/m² 359 cd/m² 339 cd/m². 93 % Center on Battery: 358. cd/m²) ΔE Color 7.1 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 6.5 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.12.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 8929 Hz 25. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 8929. Hz (Likely utilizing PWM) Flickering detected at a brightness setting of 25. There should be no flickering or PWM above this brightness setting.. Hz is quite high, so most users sensitive to PWM should not notice any flickering.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. Unfortunately, the black value is quite high at 0.49 cd/mÂ². As a result, black areas appear rather dark gray, the colors cannot really shine, and the contrast ratio is at a mediocre 731:1. In addition, we discover a high-frequency pulse width modulation, so the screen turns on and off in extremely short intervals to lower the brightness if needed. However, the frequency of the modulation is so high, that even sensitive people should not perceive any flickering.. In the laboratory tests with the spectral photometer and the CalMAN software, a clear blue tint is apparent, and furthermore the blue color tones deviate very strongly from the ideal values of the reference color space. The color temperature which is clearly to high can be lowered in the settings by a so called Comfort mode, which lowers the blue components in the image. However, the image then appears to have a slight yellow cast at first glance..

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.8 (minimum) to 240 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (26.5 ms). Response Time 50% Grey to 80% Grey 35.6 ms ... rise â and fall â combined ↗ 18.4 ms rise ↘ 17.2 ms fall The screen shows slow response rates in our tests and will be unsatisfactory for gamers. In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. When using it outside, the low brightness is the biggest problem. In addition, the reflective display that almost all smartphones have becomes an obstacle to seeing what goes on on the display in bright surroundings. In the shade, the LG K8 (2017) is fairly usable most of the time.. The viewing angles are good and even from very wide viewing angles, the display contents can be seen clearly..

The processor section of the SoC clocks at a maximum of 1.4 GHz and thus offers a performance that positions the LG K8 (2017) slightly above most of the comparison units. The LG K10 (2017) offers noticeably more power than that.. The graphics unit is an Adreno 308, and here the LG has to accept some critique: The performance of the graphics unit is considerably below that of the comparison devices. The LG K8 (2017) is therefore less suitable for fancy graphics such as in gaming or demanding apps..

The graphics card is not particularly powerful. Luckily, most of the current Android games are tuned to play fairly well even on weak devices. Subjectively, this works pretty well in " Temple Run 2, " and less demanding games such as " Angry Birds " run fluidly, anyways. However, since the graphics unit does not support most of the current graphics APIs anymore, being future-proof in terms of gaming is not a given: Some of the current game apps may not be shown in the Google Play Store, if they are not compatible with the hardware. It is fortunate, that games load quickly, because the storage access is fast.. The control via touchscreen and position sensor works pleasantly smoothly.. The LG K8 (2017) warms up to 38.4 Â°C (101 Â°F), which is very limited locally to the front. The maximum warming is noticeable, but not uncomfortable. During idle operation, the maximum warming is also at the front, at 34 Â°C (93 Â°F).. We find out with the GFXBench battery test, that the SoC apparently cannot maintain its performance capabilities during load over a longer time: The frame rates quickly break down considerably.. 38.4 °C 36.2 °C 34.9 °C. 36.5 °C 37.8 °C 34.5 °C. 34.1 °C 33.3 °C 33.4 °C.

Subjectively, we like the sound of the LG K8 (2017) speaker a little better than that of the LG K10 (2017) , although the smartphone still remains at the bottom level. The measurements of the audio test show quite a loud maximum volume, but also missing bass and very pronounced highs. Friends of a good sound will rather reach for headphones or a Bluetooth speaker, which can both be connected without any trouble to hear a sound without interference.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 44.4 25 25.4 34 31 25.3 35.9 40 32.9 31.7 50 33.6 30.9 63 31.6 37.8 80 28.4 24.9 100 27 26.3 125 20.8 27.4 160 22 25.4 200 21.3 25.6 250 20.8 26.5 315 21.2 29.6 400 19.4 37.1 500 19.5 45.2 630 17.7 54.4 800 17.9 65.5 1000 17.8 76.6 1250 17.3 78.9 1600 17.4 77.7 2000 16.7 74.4 2500 17.2 73.4 3150 18.2 72.4 4000 17.9 70 5000 17.6 68.5 6300 17.7 68.5 8000 17.8 71.9 10000 17.9 69.5 12500 18.1 63.8 16000 18.2 55.9 SPL 30 85.6 N 1.3 55 median 17.9 LG K8 2017 median 65.5 Delta 1.3 17.4 32.4 36.9 31.3 34 31.7 33.8 26 32.8 39.4 34.7 36.2 31.2 28.6 27.9 25.4 24.4 21.3 24.8 23.3 25.9 22.5 30.5 22.4 37.1 21.3 40.2 18.4 44.8 17.5 51.9 17.5 55.6 17.2 61.1 16.8 67.5 17.3 68.8 17.4 65 16.6 73.6 17.3 75.5 17.6 76.1 17.6 79.2 17.7 79.5 17.4 75.7 17.7 71 17.9 67.3 18.1 61.5 18.1 42.9 29.8 86.4 1.3 56.8 median 17.7 Huawei Y6 II Compact median 61.5 1.6 16.6 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Frequency diagram in comparison (checkboxes above can be checked or unchecked!). In terms of power consumption, the LG K8 (2017) should be highly praised: When it is turned off, it does indeed not draw any power from the battery, and during standby mode its power use is quite low. Also during operation, the smartphone uses on average less power than the comparison devices, even if it does not come out as a winner in any of the individual categories..

The greatest advantage of the 9.6 Wh battery is surely that it is removable. The WLAN runtime of almost 10 hours is decent by itself and confirms our experience, that during normal use, it can last for two days without a charger without any trouble. If you packed an extra battery, it doesn't matter if you left your charger at home during your trip over a long weekend.. Although the power saving mode offers no extraordinary features, it prolongs the runtime again considerably, if needed..

In the test: LG K8 (2017). Test unit provided by LG Germany.. before, with the LG K8 (2017) the Korean manufacturer also delivers quite a high-quality budget smartphone, which offers features not always found in this price range. First, there is the decent equipment supporting NFC and the modern bluetooth standard. However, for the highlight of a fingerprint sensor, you look in vain. Instead, there is a good call sound and cameras that are very good for this price class. Precise input devices and a removable battery with a decent runtime also belong to the upsides of the LG K8 (2017), and the casing appears relatively high-quality as well.. You should manually readjust the focus of pictures often, since there are some slight problems here, and also the screen overall is too dark. The speaker is rated below the level of this price class, which is low anyways, and the graphics card is weak and hardly future proof.. A casing that appears high-quality, good cameras, a removable battery â anyone who is not scared off by the missing fingerprint reader and the dark screen makes a good purchase with the LG K8 (2017).. Anyone who can live with that, gets a solid budget smart phone that appears to be of good quality, and currently still saves almost 50 Euros (~$53) in comparison to the LG K10 (2017) , whose cameras and screen are not any better, but which has a considerably better performance. As long as the large price difference remains and you don't need the additional power, the LG K8 (2017) is currently the better deal.. LG K8 2017 - 2017-04-19 04/19/2017 v6 Florian Wimmer.

LG K10 (2017) review: Good phone but lags behind in the race. Published: Wednesday, March 29, 2017, 10:00 [IST]. Design and Display: Plastic design feels neither cheap nor premium Interface and Software: Performance is pretty smooth Hardware: Makes it lag behind the competition Camera: Selfie camera comes in as a surprise Battery and Connectivity: Removable battery and USB OTG are welcome additions Verdict. LG announced an affordable smartphone in the K series earlier this year and the same has been released in India with a price tag of Rs. The LG K10 (2017) comes with several attractive features.. Wide angle selfie camera | Removable battery | SoS button | Android Nougat OS. Interface needs improvement | Plastic body | Expensive price tag. But, will the smartphone be able to get a breathing space for itself in the already competitive mobile market in the country? Let's find out in this review.. The K10 that has been made in India comes with the SoS feature and runs on Android 7.0 Nougat. LG has announced the K10 in three color options - Gold, Black, and Titanium.. The device is bundled with a free smart cover and there is unlimited Hungama access for 45 days facilitating audio and video downloads without any limit. If these features aren't enough for you to buy this phone, here is our complete review.. On the design front, the LG K10 (2017) features a compact form factor that makes it comfortable to hold. The rear panel has an ergonomic design. It's back is made of plastic and the same is textured too. There is a metallic effect on the edges that gives a little premium look. The back panel is removable and so you can remove the battery too.. There is a fingerprint sensor at the rear of this phone, It has been placed below the rear camera and the sensor also doubles as the lock/power key. The volume rocket is located at the left in such a way that it is easy to operate.. The phone is pretty lightweight at 142 grams and carries a slim profile with 7.9 mm thickness. There is a micro USB port and a 3.5mm audio jack at the bottom of the phone.. When it comes to the display, the LG K10 flaunts a 5.3-inch HD 720p in-cell IPS display with 2.5D curved glass on top. During our usage, the display performed pretty average for its pricing.. The viewing angles and color reproduction were not disappointing. The brightness level can be adjusted, but the sunlight visibility becomes a tough task at times until it is adjusted to have the maximum brightness. There are no capacitive buttons on the phone as it has only on-screen buttons for various functions.. The LG K10 (2017) runs on Android 7.0 Nougat OS out-of-the-box based on the company's UI. The device seems to be pretty smooth in terms of performance during our review period. There is a dedicated SoS feature that will be activated on pressing the power button thrice. This feature will call the India specific emergency number 112.. One of the on-screen buttons lets you access the SIM card manager in a single click. The LG's skin has removed the app drawer by default. However, the same can be enabled from the Settings if you don't want to see all the apps on the home screens.. The LG phone is equipped with an octa-core MediaTek MT6750 processor that is clocked at 1.5GHz. The processor is paired with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage capacity. One good thing for the users is that there is expandable storage support up to 2TB via a micro SD card slot.. With these hardware aspects, the smartphone manages the everyday tasks without any difficulty. We tested the device by browsing the internet and checking social networks. While these tasks were handled pretty much decently, it showed a bit of lag in handling multitasking but this can be ignored until you are a heavy user.. The LG K10 features a 13MP main snapper at its rear with f/2.2 aperture, LED flash, and autofocus. Up front, there is a 5MP selfie camera with 120-degree wide angle lens. When it comes to the camera performance, there seems to be missing details and grainy pictures on capturing close-up shots.. Otherwise, the outdoor performance was pretty decent. While using the front camera, you can easily switch between the portrait and wide view in a single click.. Under immense lighting, the camera captured colors impressively. You can check out the performance from the camera samples given here. On the whole, we can saty that the camera performance is above average.. As we had mentioned in the design section, one of the features that you can see in the LG smartphone is the removable battery, thanks to the plastic back cover. The battery capacity is 2800mAh and it can render a decent backup to the device for almost a day.. During out review, we used the phone some light gaming, browsing, video streaming, and calls. The phone did manage to last almost a day, except for a few hours on regular usage on a single charge. However, it may not be the right model for the heavy users as it is power hungry on using 4G continuously.. In terms of connectivity, the LG K10 has Bluetooth 4.2, USB 2.0, dual SIM, USB OTG, Wi-Fi, and 4G LTE on board.. The LG K10 (2017) is a compact phone with a nice design, mediocre performance, capable camera and above average display. The device has the advantage of running Android Nougat in its price point. Given the price tag of Rs. 13,990, the smartphone seems to be overpriced than its competitors that are among the best-sellers in the market.. On comparing it with the Honor 6X, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, etc., this smartphone might lag behind as the rivals have a premium metallic design language, and render superior performance as well..

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running..

South Korean giant LG Electronics launched the LG K10 (2017) mid-range smartphone way back in December 2016. Five months after, the device has already arrived here in our home country, the Philippines. The newly-landed handset can now be purchased for Php 8,990 and is available in two color variants, namely Gold and Shiny Black.

Regarding the battery, the device comes with minimal specs of 2800mAh.. To conclude, the LG K10 (2017) has nothing extraordinary to show against its rivals.

BASED ON 14 RATING(S). 10 Jun 2017 By Yasodharan S T On flipkart.com. LG is still kept its promise on quality, am aware at this price range redmi , lenovo and other brands with good specs available but when comes to quality built LG is beast. And most of its phone is selling under the radar hence people not aware of LG quality. I am suggesting this phone who looks for quality and durability to last for 4-5 years should go for it and its not suggested for those who update mobile for every six months. 25 May 2017 By Flipkart Customer On flipkart.com. LG K10 2017 was good phone , fingerprint was awosome and battary life is good but we need in 4G phone some more but casual use battary life is good and look was best in whole phone arena and most important this phone was not hang and no heating problem like other 4G handsets and Both camera 📷 was average quality pic capture (GOOD).

(Last letter varies by carrier and international models). Original: Android 6.0 "Marshmallow". Android 5.1.1 "Lollipop" (some variants). K42x/MS428/L61AL/L62VL: Qualcomm Snapdragon 410. K430x: MediaTek MT6753. Mediatek: Octa-core (1.3 - 1.5 GHz octa-core ARM Cortex-A53). Qualcomm Snapdragon: Octa-core (1.2 GHz Cortex-A53). Qualcomm Snapdragon: Adreno 306. GB RAM (K430DSF). GB RAM (K420N, K425, K428SG and MS428). GB RAM (K420DS and K430DSY). The LG K10 (also sold as the LG Premier on Tracfone) is a mid-range Android smartphone developed by LG Electronics and released in 2016. In the United States it is currently available on AT&T Mobility , MetroPCS , T-Mobile and Tracfone. Priced under $200 and running 6.0 "Marshmallow" , [a] it is considered one of the top 10 budget phones of 2016 by Consumer Electronics Show. A successor to the phone of the same name, with a fingerprint sensor and a built-in panic alarm for South Asian regions, was released the following year. Several variants of the phone were released, with different processors, RAM capacity, cameras, dual SIM , NFC and 4G LTE support depending on the country. [3] North American and certain Eurasian variants of the K10 (K420DS, K420N, K425, K428SG, L61AL, L62VL and MS428) run on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410, while the K430DS, K430DSF, K430DSY and the Brazilian-market K430TV models use a MediaTek MT6753. The K10 has a 5.3-inch (130. mm) IPS LCD touchscreen, and comes in two distinct variations that differ primarily in the internal hardware. The K42x version, sold by T-Mobile, AT&T and MetroPCS in the United States, in Europe as the K420N and in India as the K420DS, has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 410 system-on-chip [4] [5] ; LG has also released the K430x variant of the phone in select markets—while sharing the same form factor as the K42x models, the K430 model uses MediaTek 's MT6753 system-on-chip containing a 1.3 - 1.5 GHz octa-core ARM Cortex-A53, and a Mali-T720 GPU. The K10 has a maximum of 2GB RAM, depending on the model—the K430DSF only comes with 1GB; the K420N and North American K425, K428SG and MS428 variants come with 1.5GB [5] [7] and the K420DS and K430DSY has 2GB of RAM. All variants come with either 8 or 16GB of onboard storage, depending on the variant. In addition to the internal storage, the K10's storage capacity can be expanded using a microSDXC card. Depending on the country, the K10 may come with 4G LTE support—the L62VL variant sold by Tracfone as the LG Premier LTE comes with support for CDMA2000 and 4G LTE, near-field communication , which is unavailable on the K430x models, a 13 megapixel rear-facing camera and a 5 megapixel front-facing camera for video calls; North American models only come with an 8 megapixel camera in lieu of the 13 megapixel sensor. In addition, the Brazilian-market K430TV comes with a built-in ISDB-T receiver.. The K10 runs on either Android 5.1.1 "Lollipop" or Android 6.0.1 "Marshmallow" depending on the model, along with LG's proprietary user interface. Among other things, the phone's operating system supports knock-on gestures allowing the user to unlock the device by tapping on the display in a certain manner, and support for smart covers where part of the screen is visible to display notifications or incoming calls, to which the user can swipe up or down to answer or reject it.. Reception for the K10 has been mixed to positive upon release, with most reviewers noting its performance and build quality but criticizing the price, camera quality and lack of USB OTG support. [8] [9] [10] Ajay Kumar of PC Magazine gave the MetroPCS variant of the K10 a mixed review, praising the device's build and price, but noted the camera quality along with the antiquated processor used which hampered performance in system-intensive games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. [7] In a similarly mixed review, Ashish Mohta of TechPP also praised the K10's performance, yet criticized the camera, its price compared to other mid-range devices, and lack of quick charging support. [11] Florian Wimmer of the German-language edition of Notebook Check stated that the K10 wants to "bring style to the lower middle-class", but was also critical of the phone's camera and display, describing it as "standing in the way". ^ For selected variants, e.g. the Mediatek K430 models; certain Qualcomm models are still limited to Android 5.1 Lollipop as of July 2017.. ^ a b "LG K10". ^ Lancaster, Luke (4 January 2017).
