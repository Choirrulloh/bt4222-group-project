Author Dhruv Bhutani Posted on January 12, 2017 January 12, 2017 Categories Reviews , Xolo. 5-inch (1280 x 720 pixels) HD On-cell IPS display. 2GB/3GB RAM, 16GB internal memory, expandable memory up to 32GB with microSD. 8MP autofocus rear camera with LED Flash, f/2.0 aperture, 5P Largan lens. 4G VoLTE, WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS. "Xolo Era 2X Review" , 1 out of 5 based on 59 ratings.. Xolo has always been a bit slow to adopt the latest specifications, opting for a more refined and well-rounded experience. The company recently launched their first smartphone equipped with a fingerprint scanner. Admittedly, very late to the market, we spent some time with the device to see if it packs enough to. The Era 2X is a budget device and it reflects in the design language on offer. Generic would be an apt description for the front of the phone. Thick bezels run along all sides but the chin at the bottom is particularly apparent. The black panel set around the 5 inch display makes the phone appear larger than it is.. The phone eschews capacitive keys for on-screen controls. Up at the top is a 5MP front facing camera. On the other side of the earpiece lies the ambient light as well as proximity sensor.. The black panel set around the 5 inch display makes the phone appear larger than it is. A metal frame runs all along the sides of the phone and sits proud of the black panel thereby adding more girth to the phone. Owing to the large bezels and frame, the Xolo Era 2X isn’t much smaller than a device equipped with a 5.5 inch display.. Over on the right hand side lies the volume rocker as well as the power button. Predictably, feedback is minimal and the buttons are very spongy. The left side is bereft of buttons while the top and bottom sport left aligned headphone jacks and microUSB ports respectively.. Moving over to the back, the removable rear panel is made of soft touch plastic with a speaker grille lined up at the bottom. Towards the top you’ll spot the concentric camera module and fingerprint sensor. Between the two lies the single LED flash. 9.5 mm and backs up our opinion that the phone is surprisingly large for a device with just a 5 inch display.. The interface on the Xolo Era 2X is bog standard and we weren’t really expecting anything else either. Like stock Android, the homescreen displays the time and date with shortcuts for the camera and Google Assistant at the right and left bottom corners respectively. Swiping up drops you straight into the homescreen.. The phone retains a separate app drawer. As expected, you can keep selected widgets and apps on the homescreen. Tapping the shortcut button launches the app drawer where you can view all installed apps in one go.. Customisations throughout the interface are limited. Xolo has put a lot of emphasis on the gesture support built into the phone. The fingerprint reader does up as a button of sorts and you can use it to open the camera, take a photograph, answer calls and even to stop alarms. Similarly, you can draw gestures on the screen to launch specific functions.. The Xolo Era 2X is not the device to look at if performance is paramount for you. There’s just 2GB of RAM on the offline version while the online variant of the smartphone gets a healthier 3GB. Interface navigation works well enough and there’s not much of a slow down if any at all. Games do take a bit longer to start up and this is one area where the lower end specifications are easy to make out. We’ve included some benchmarks below to show how the phone lines up against the competition.. In the 3D Mark Ice Storm Unlimited benchmark, the Xolo Era 2X scored 3729 points which is around the middle of the test bench.. In the AnTuTu 6 Benchmark, the phone scores 30390 points which is particularly good for the category.. Similarly in GFXBench 2.7, the phone scores 588.2 frames per second which is towards the upper end of the test bench.. Equipped with a 5 inch 720p display, the screen on the Xolo Era 2X isn’t particularly great. We’re willing to concede a bit on the resolution due to the size and price point but it is certainly possible to get a higher quality panel even in this price range.. While contrast levels and brightness is predictably sub-optimal, what really got us was the extremely high color shift just a few degrees off straight on. The screen looks passable when you look at it head on but moving even slightly over to the side and the change in color gets very off-putting.. The Xolo Era 2X is equipped with an 8MP rear facing camera. An f/2.0 lens and 5P Largan lens sounds good on paper but real life performance is a bit less than ideal.. As is true of most phones in the budget to mid segment, you can expect passable photos only if the lighting is really good. Unless you are shooting straight into the light, we observed decently accurate colors.. Dynamic range is limited and you won’t get much details if zoom in. Step indoors though and you can almost forget about taking photos from the Era 2X. The software is seemingly optimised to keep the shutter open longer to allow in more light but without optical image stabilisation you invariably end up with a blurry shot.. The Xolo Era 2X packs all the basic connectivity options that are expected from a device of its calibre. Bluetooth, GPS, WiFi b/g/n and 4G LTE wrap up the connectivity capabilities. The Era 2X ships with FM Radio capabilities as well which is a nice addition for the category. The phone has dual SIM card support as well as a microSD card slot. With just 16GB of built-in storage of which 9.71GB is available at launch , the presence of a memory card slot is definitely appreciated.. Battery life proved to be hit or miss on the Xolo Era 2X. The 2,500 mAh removable battery is a fair bit smaller than most other devices in the sub Rs. 10,000 segment but on the flip side, it affords you the option to switch it out as and when you please.. The Xolo Era 2X might be a special device for the brand that has been extremely slow on taking up technology but it isn’t anything special in the larger scheme of affairs.. The phone is priced at Rs. 6,666 for the 2GB RAM variant while the 3GB RAM variant goes for Rs. Meanwhile, the Redmi 3S is similarly priced and offers a much larger battery and better display. All said and done, given the number of arguably better options available, Xolo will have to do a lot more to make a mark for itself. The phone is available exclusively on.

Bad Stuff Slow and sluggish software Display is poor Fast battery drain. Xolo Era 2X 3GB RAM Details. The Xolo Era 2X 3GB is a feature packed device, and it comes at an entry-level price range. The device is in direct competition with Xiaomi Redmi 3S and the Redmi 3S Prime. The device has a fingerprint scanner on the back just like the Redmi 3S Prime from Xiaomi, but this device is priced lesser than the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime. The back of the Xolo Era 2X 3GB has a soft-touch removable panel, while the front of the device has an end-to-end glass look. The device measures 72.3 x 144 x 9.5 mm.. Being a budget device, the Xolo Era 2X 3GB flaunts a 5-inch HD display with IPS technology. To make the device affordable, Xolo had to skip the Gorilla Glass protection. Instead, it comes with a fully laminated display.. As more and more people are shifting towards the front-facing camera, Xolo has provided a 5-megapixel selfie camera with screen flash. The screen flash was earlier found only on the high-end devices like Apple iPhone but looks like it has made its way to the entry-level devices as well. A primary camera is an 8-megapixel unit with LED flash and autofocus.. The buyers would be delighted to know that the device does not come with any bloatware; it doesn't even come with a pre-installed Chrome browser. Instead, it uses the stock Android browser. The Android version of the Xolo Era 2X is 6.0 Marshmallow. As with all the budget or entry-level smartphone devices, we doubt that the Xolo Era 2X 3GB will be updated to the latest Android 7.0 Nougat.. The Xolo Era 2X 3GB comes with MediaTek MT6737 chipset. The MediaTek MT6737 chipset has a quad-core processor and a Mali-T720 GPU. As the name of the device suggests, the Xolo Era 2X comes with a massive 3GB of RAM. However, we doubt that the processor will be able to advantage from it. The internal storage on the device is 16GB, and it has a dedicated microSD card slot.. Under the removable back of the device is a 2,500 mAh removable battery. The battery capacity might not seem too much, but it is sufficient to power the small display and the efficient hardware. The battery can be charged through a microUSB port on the bottom of the device. The Xolo Era 2X come with Jio’s Welcome offer that provides free calls, SMS, and data till 31st March 2017.

Xolo Era 2X Price in India. 6888/- Buy Now Set Price Drop Alert. The Xolo Era 2X would have made sense a few years ago, but it doesn’t stand a chance against competitors like the Xiaomi Redmi 3s today.. The Xolo Era 2X is an average smartphone overall. It’s not the fastest out there and has an average camera. There’s a lot of work to be done.. CONS Pedestrian design Sub-par performance Average camera.

Xolo Era 2X is currently available at the best price of: ₹6,888. The Xolo Era line of smartphones are generally priced around the 6K price point or lower. At that price, there is not much competition and all major brands offer pretty much the same hardware. However with its recent attempt, the Era 2X (3GB), Xolo is trying to take on the Xiaomi Redmi 3S and the Meizu M3S .. On paper, the Era 2X doesn't seem that impressive, considering it has inferior specifications. However, that doesn’t always make for a weaker smartphone. The Xolo Era 2X didn’t impress us on first impressions, but can it change the game? Here’s the review.. The first things to notice about the Xolo Era 2X are its shape and size. Xolo’s design language is rather old school. It has the same rounded edges, a matte-ish back, with thick bezels on the front, that we have seen on older devices. The utilitarian approach to design may have worked at one time and some may still like it, but it is not what you would call “moving with the times”. That being said, like other 5-inch budget devices the phone is ergonomic.. Its build quality is also a little behind its time with plastic on all fronts. So, it does not feel as sturdy as other metal-clad smartphones in the same price category. It doesn’t necessarily feel like a “cheap” phone, but it’s not up to the standards set by a Xiaomi Redmi 3S etc.. Two things that stick out are the slippery back and the rear speaker slot, which gets muffled very easily.. It is hard to make a bad display these days and the Xolo Era 2X does not have one either. The rather small 5-inch display offers good colour saturation and decent touch response. Viewing angles are not good, with a visible colour shift from not very wide angles. Sunlight visibility is also better than most devices in this price and can be considered amongst the better displays in the category. It has a max luminescence of 550 lux at the centre of the display.. As for the UI, nothing has changed since the Xolo Era 1X and we like the fact that it hasn’t. Unlike most budget smartphones, the Era 2X does not have a heavy UI on top of the OS. Instead, the whole interface looks almost like stock Android. The custom Hivelauncher runs in the foreground, which looks and almost exactly like the Google launcher. As for the pre-loaded apps, you get the entire JIO app suite, a third party dialer, and some more additional apps, which you can uninstall. Also, the rear mounted fingerprint scanner does a good job and can be used to lock apps.. The phone is powered by a relatively new MediaTek MT6737 SoC, which shares its DNA with the much used MediaTeK MT6735, which was seen on the Meizu M2 back in 2015. The new SoC is coupled with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of on-board storage.. The Xolo Era 2X is slow, with slight stutters on regular tasks. To be clear, you can get by with this level of performance, but you can also get much better. With about a dozen apps in the background, the phone really starts lagging, and often even feels like it’s not responding to touches. Further, load times on games are higher, and while games like Asphalt 8 do run, frame drops are evident and frustrating. Asphalt 8 remained lower than 30fps regularly.. Powering the entire setup is a 2500mAh removable battery, which is average. In the PCMark battery test, the phone scored 4 hours and 21 minutes on a single charge. Using the phone as a daily driver, with only essential apps like Gmail, Youtube, chat applications, calling, music streaming and a couple of hours of browsing, brought the battery down to 20 percent in about 6 hours of usage.. Gaming on the phone further deteriorates the battery and we recorded a battery loss of 22-25 percent in an hour of gaming. Now all these scores are pretty average and there are better devices in the market.. The Xolo Era 2X features an 8MP rear camera, which again is average. Photographs captured by the smartphone, especially in ample light conditions have decent colour saturation, but details are still somewhat missing. Images aren’t very sharp, but edges are distinct enough for sharing on social platforms. There is too much noise in photographs, which become even more apparent under low light.. In addition, the slower focusing speeds make it even more difficult to take a steady shot under darker conditions. Further, the camera application is very basic - you get your essential panorama and beauty features, but no manual mode as we are starting to see on other devices in this category.. The Xolo Era 2X is an average smartphone overall. It’s not the fastest out there and has an average camera. The design is pedestrian, and you can get better battery life from its competitors as well. The display and UI are still likeable, but overall, the smartphone doesn’t really make a very good case for itself. Phones like the Xiaomi Redmi 3s would make for better choices..

The feature not only secures the handset conveniently but also makes it compatible with services like Google Pay.. Good camera features : From an entry level smartphone, we do not except much from the camera except take good pictures in good lighting and capturing decent videos. However, that is not the case with this handset as it comes packed with features like burst modes, beauty mode and slow motion videos among others.. VoLTE : Most budget smartphones do not come with the support for VoLTE and as such does not support the JIO SIM, which is a deal breaker for Indian buyer these days. However, Xolo Era 2X has been equipped with integrated support for VoLTE and should be compatible with the JIO SIM out of the box.. Small Battery : When a person selects a phone, the main criterion every time is the camera and battery for an average user. And if the handset is lacking in any one of these aspect, it is simply ignored by many. The Xolo Era 2X is plagued by a smaller battery viz. 2500 mAh, which you can expect to run out before the day end.. XOLO Era 2X 2GB RAM Price in India. Black +2 Variants. 5,699 .00. 5,999 .00.
