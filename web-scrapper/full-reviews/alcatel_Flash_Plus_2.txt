This new high-end smartphone is probably one of the best choices as it offers high-end specifications and promising performance at a decent price. What's interesting is that this phone has now been made available in the Philippines.. Alcatel seems to have mastered the technique of presenting great smartphones and Alcatel Flash Plus 2 stands as a great example. The relevance and potent of this device are reflected by its design that has been beautifully crafted.. To combine a game-changing smartphone experience within a stylish and premium platform, the company has laid their focus to the phone's basic elements. The build and make-up are the very first aspect that Alcatel has been concerned with and focused on.. To keep up with the latest market trends, the company has presented bold curves in its body which are complemented by the use of aluminum. To create subtle grooves for bringing out improvements in stability and grip, 3 forms of polishing have been done.. Alcatel is a brand that operates under the license of TCL Corporation which is a Chinese Electronics company. The brand has been developed to specifically focus on manufacturing mobile handsets.. Alcatel is a joint venture between TCL (55%) and Alcatel-Lucent (45%). As TCL acquired Alcatel-Lucent's share in 2005, the joint venture was dissolved, and TCL wholly owned this brand as a subsidiary.. To make security direct, safe and sound, Alcatel has incorporated a fingerprint sensor in the front physical home button. There's no greater password than one's own unique fingerprint, and using it for securing this device is the best utilization that could possibly be. This fingerprint sensor is able to read and unlock the device within 0.5 seconds.. To bring out the best of entertainment, Alcatel Flash Plus 2 has been equipped with an NXP9890 audio amplifier which increases the overall sound quality. Unlike in other phones, this model is able to deliver 5 – 9dB amplification.. The Flash Plus 2 MIX is an intuitive app that has been included in this model. This app lets the users remix and compose their own music.. Never miss out on favorite moments with this new Flash Plus 2 as it incorporates a 13 MP rear camera. The accuracy and productivity of this camera are enhanced by PDAF (phase detection autofocus) which is able to manage proper focus within 0.1 seconds.. As a dual-LED (dual tone) flash has been presented, stunning photos can be achieved regardless of the lighting condition. Its secondary/front camera is of 5 MP which also uses a LED flash. This front camera has got high Color Rendering Index (CRI) which manages supplementary lighting. It also consists of 84.4° ultra-wide angle lens which is helpful in taking group shots.. This Flash Plus 2 is powered by a non-removable Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery. This battery provides standby up to 405 hours (3G)/52 hours (2G), music plays for up to 54 hours and talk-time up to 15 hours (3G), 16 hours (2G) will be allowed. With the Flash Charging feature, 10 hours of talk time standby can be achieved in just 30 minutes.. Among several Chinese smartphones manufacturing companies that are popular in the Philippines, Alcatel is one of them. The competition in the tech market of the Philippines is only growing and several surveys that have been recently conducted stand evident to this. Domestic companies have been growing strong making things challenging for international vendors.. Reviews of Alcatel Flash Plus 2. User Review : 4 Reviews. bago na bago ang phone alcatel.

Review: Flash Plus 2 misses the mark. By Ajith Ram | Jun 03, 2016. is your opinion of the Flash brand? Come on, admit it. It is hardly a brand which jumps out when you think of smartphones. In a market flooded with advertising from the likes of Apple, Samsung and Huawei, one would be tempted to ask Flash who?. This does not mean that the company's smartphones are a laughing matter. In fact, judging by the previous Flash phones, the new Flash Plus 2 might be something to look forward to.. It is amazing how similar smartphones are beginning to look these days. So much so that if you exclude the manufacturer logos, it would be hard to distinguish between them at a distance, even between those in different categories. The Flash Plus 2 is a unimetal body smartphone - similar to the Oppo F1 Plus and last year's Huawei Nexus 6P. But unlike these phones, the Flash Plus 2 is priced for the budget market. So it would be more appropriate to compare it to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. See the rear of the two phones below side by side.. It could be argued that the the Flash Plus 2 with its pronounced brushed metal back and a front screen with an invisible bezel (when not lit) is the better looking phone. The volume and power buttons are on the right edge while the micro USB 2.0 port is at the bottom left. It is a pity that the Plus 2 does not have the newer Type C USB port. At just 157gms, it is not too heavy either. The Flash Plus 2 has the bog standard Full HD LCD display. Although there are no surprises here, the display is on par with the best smartphones in the budget market segment. Even in its battery-saving setting, the display is bright and clear. One interesting touch in the Plus 2 is the slightly raised edges that adorn all four sides of the screen. This ensures that the screen itself is never in full contact with a flat surface if you end up placing the phone upside down. Although this makes the Flash Plus 2 less likely to pick up scratches, a full-fledged screen protector would not go amiss. Like many mid-range and budget smartphones, the Flash Plus 2 (like the Oppo F1 Plus) is powered by a MediaTek MT6755 Helio P10 processor. The CPU in the Helio P10 consists of a quad core 1.8 GHz Cortex-A53 ARM CPU and another quad core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU. The faster quad core CPU kicks in when a more demanding application requires it. The GPU is a Mali-T860MP2 from ARM as well. The Flash Plus 2 is available in two memory configurations. The basic version with 16GB of storage has 2GB of RAM while the more expensive one with 32GB of storage has 3GB of memory. Both versions have a dedicated microSD slot which can accommodate a 128GB card if required. The Flash Plus 2 has a 13 megapixel rear camera and a five megapixel front camera. With an ability to record 1080p videos and a smaller sensor size than those in the premium phones, the rear camera specifications are nothing to write home about. The same applies to the available camera settings. The Flash Plus 2 does not provide a full-fledged manual mode like the mid-range and premium smartphones. You have some control over white balance and exposure. There are also some preset settings such as Face Beauty, Gesture Shot, Smile Shot and Kids Mode. So how does the image quality of the Flash Plus 2 compare to those of other phones in its price range?. In day time, the image quality can be described as adequate. But the real test of a smartphone camera these days is at night or in shadow. See below a photo taken with the Flash Plus 2 at night.. And a photo of the same location taken with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3.. Unfortunately, at least at night, it feels as if the Plus 2 has gone back a few generations in smartphone camera quality. Very surprising to say the least. And just for comparison, see the photo taken with a high-end Galaxy Note 5. As the saying goes, the difference is like day and night.. The Flash Plus 2 has a 3,000 mAh battery. Again, compared to the Redmi Note 3 which is in its price range, it is considerably lower. In our PCMark battery test, the Flash Plus 2 lasted six hours and 20 minutes. This compares well with a more expensive phone such as the Oppo F1 Plus. Considering that both the Oppo F1 Plus and the Flash Plus 2 use the same Helio P10 processor, it is no surprise that both devices have identical 3DMark scores. But compared to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, the Flash Plus 2 is considerably slower. The Plus 2 ships with Android 'Lollipop' 6.0. As expected, since it is a budget smartphone, unique high quality apps are rather thin on the ground. The device ships with the usual gallery of Google apps such as Gmail and YouTube. The best ones have to be downloaded from the Play Store. With one eye firmly on the budget smartphone segment, how should we rate the Flash Plus 2? Although excellent in terms of physical design, the Plus 2 is simply outclassed by other devices, particularly those from Chinese manufacturers such as Xiaomi. Saddled with mediocre performance and a woeful camera, the Flash Plus 2 is likely to have a tough time in the crowded market. Slugfest: Oppo F1 vs Apple iPhone 6.

HDR might not be real .... finally after more than 2 yrs with me, my AOFP fail to get any signal from both sim. maybe most of the smartphone will only survive this long. nice spec, good price, but with hard-to-get accessories and never-update-os, i will stop using....

Negative: No NFC or LTE (band 800); average design; inaccurate fingerprint sensor; poor cameras. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 09/28/2016. This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. The former French manufacturer of telecommunication equipment merged to Alcatel-Lucent in 2006. Several business segments were sold to other companies, so the Alcatel brand is now used by various companies. The Chinese company TCL uses the brand names "Alcatel One Touch" and "Alcatel Idol" for smartphones and tablets.. The market share in the smartphone + tablet segment is very small, but there are quite some recent reviews in different languages. The ratings are average (as of 2016)..

Alcatel Flash Plus 2: A Successor that is worth your Time and Money Alcatel has finally unveiled a powerful smartphone that succeeds the existing Flash Plus. Termed as Flash Plus 2, this handset brings in an exhaustive array of high-end specifications and will soon start selling in Venus gold and Luna silver colors. Let us take a closer look at the best possible conglomerate of specifications on offer from Alcatel: Pros Alcatel Flash Plus 2 brings in a 5.5-Inch screen offering 1920x1080 pixels , in terms of resolution. The OGS panel supports a contrast ratio of 1000:1 besides exhibiting a 160-degree, wide viewing angle. Dual-SIM support is rendered to this smartphone followed by 3G and 4G LTE connectivity. Other specs include Wireless compatibility, GPS for navigation and Bluetooth v4.1. Powering this gadget is a 3,000mAh battery module that also supports Flash Charging beefing up the unit by 50 percent in only half an hour. Android Marshmallow v6.0 is the existing operating platform. Alcatel’s newest smartphone adorns a unibody metallic chassis measuring 8.20mm in thickness and weighing 157 grams. A 13MP rear facing camera unit is on offer boasting of OV13853 sensor, dual-tone flashlight support, PDAF and f/2.0 lens aperture. Alcatel also fits in a powerful fingerprint sensor alongside the IRD digital filter and audio amplifier. Cons Alcatel puts up a great show in terms of features barring the availability of OIS that was expected with the primary shooter as per the existing specs sheet. Unique Selling Points Alcatel Flash Plus 2 might just be the cheapest handset as compared to the others with comparable attributes, courtesy MediaTek’s Helio P10 chipset which isn’t as hyped as other SoCs. The featured chipset works perfectly in unison with an Octa-Core processor and Mali T860MP2 GPU. 3GB RAM is a pretty good deal followed by an internal storage limit of 32GB expandable further up to 128GB.
