more ... more .... more ... more .... 1 Huawei Mate 10 Lite Review. by Victor Hristov. Android - Android + Huawei - Huawei +. 1 Huawei Mate 10 Lite Review. The Huawei Mate 10 Lite is a mid-range phone sold across the globe (but not in the United States) as the more affordable sibling to the high-end Mate 10 series. The phone features a 2:1 screen – one that's taller than traditional 16:9 screens we used to see on virtually every new phone until about last year. It is built of solid metal and it runs on Huawei’s own Emotion UI interface on top of Android 7.0 Nougat. The Mate 10 Lite also has a dual camera system on both the front and the back, with a 2-megapixel secondary camera on both sides that allows shooting photos with a blurred background – an effect that resembles the look you get with a dedicated DSLR camera. We spent a few days using the Mate 10 Lite to find out how good of a phone it really is. Read on for our experience with Huawei’s new mid-ranger. Design Premium and sturdy, the Mate 10 Lite is built of solid aluminum and made to last. The first thing to notice about the Huawei Mate 10 Lite is that it really does not feel as big as you would expect a 5.9-inch phone to be. In fact, its physical size is about the same as that of the OnePlus 5 – a phone with a 5.5-inch screen, but with a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio. Huawei achieved this by putting a taller, 2:1 display on the Mate 10 Lite (more on it later). This is still not a phone that you can conveniently operate with one hand, of course, but it is manageably big. The Mate 10 Lite is built of aluminum and feels sturdy, substantial, and made to last. It is slightly curved around its sides, very much like an iPhone 6/7/8, and its back is flat. The physical volume and power buttons are all on the right and feel nice and clicky. On the back you have a fingerprint scanner. It unlocks the phone with just a tap even from stand-by, as it should, and it is impressively fast. (Interesting fact: Huawei was the pioneer of this one-tap fingerprint log-in feature.) Right above the fingerprint reader you have the dual main camera system. Its position is a bit too close to the finger sensor, and you may often hit the lower camera, accidentally smudging it when trying to unlock the phone. It’s not a big deal, but it is one little detail that does not feel completely right. The dual camera system itself sticks out quite a bit, but it is perfectly centered, and you can lay the phone on its back without it wiggling. Unfortunately, there is no water-proofing on the Mate 10 Lite, so be careful not to get it wet. On the bottom there is a single speaker (more on audio quality later), a headphone jack (thankfully), and a… microUSB port for charging. Yes, we are as disappointed as you probably are reading about a microUSB port in 2018, and we wish Huawei did not cheap out here. USB-C should definitely be a part of all phones in 2018, except for maybe the very cheapest ones.. Display Having a 2:1 screen on an affordable phone is nice, but colors could be better. The Huawei Mate 10 Lite has an ample, 5.9-inch display with a 18:9 (2:1) aspect ratio making it taller than the 16:9 screens on phones from the past years. This screen is about as wide as a 16:9 5.5-inch display, which is great since it is not too wide in the hand while still fitting more content. Speaking of handling, the screen is slightly curved towards the edges, which makes a big difference in terms of how pleasant it is to swipe on it. But how good is it in terms of color and quality? First, it is an LCD screen, so you don’t have quite the lush colors that you get with AMOLED, but it still looks fine. One compromise it makes, however, is with color quality. The most notable issue is that the screen is very bluish by default. You do have a color temperature slider that you can play around with in settings to alleviate this a bit, but you will not have a complete fix. Brightness gets to around 500 nits and with no excessive reflections, the screen is not too hard to see even outdoors on a sunny day. Huawei Mate 10 Lite has a display very, very similar to that of the Honor 7X, and while we cannot verify if it’s exactly the same one, the both do look almost identical. Interface and Functionality Huawei’s Emotion UI is one of the most heavily modified Android interfaces around and it takes getting used to. The Huawei Mate 10 Lite – like most affordable Android phones – is a victim of the Android update situation from day one as it ships with the older Android 7.0 Nougat. It may take months until it gets the current Android 8 version, and it is questionable whether it will get any major future Android updates. It will surely get security updates, though. Once we get this out of the way and look at the actual phone, we see that its custom Emotion UI on top of Android makes it look very, very different from Google 's Material Design. Emotion UI is a complete overhaul of the Android visual style in favor of an iPhone-esque interface. From the lack of an app drawer, the design of the settings menu, the look of the icons, the swipe-down action that brings local search and from many other cues, it’s not hard to see that Huawei is clearly more influenced by Apple in its design choices than by stock Android. Many interface elements appear very dated and the whole interface is in dire need of a visual refresh. Emotion UI also supports themes, but while they offer some variety, none of them feels esthetically pleasing. This would matter more to some than to others, but it’s one thing we ought to mention. Functionally, Emotion UI is well-capable of running everything just fine. It has some crazy features like knuckle gestures: you can use your knuckles to draw letters to quick-start apps and take screenshots. It also has some not so crazy yet still useful features like twin apps where you can run two accounts of one app – handy if you manage two different social profiles, for example. Pro Tip: You can swipe up from the bottom part of the lockscreen to get something like Apple’s Control Center menu of quick toggles: you can quickly switch wallpapers, record an audio note, open the calculator, flashlight, timer or scan a QR code. Processor, Performance and Memory Smooth in daily use, but not one to win benchmark testing records. One thing we like about most Huawei phones is that they run very smoothly in the daily grind. The Mate 10 Lite is no exception as it moves at a swift 60fps throughout the home screen, and opening apps is fairly swift, with very rare slowdowns. Other much more expensive phones (cough, Samsung , cough) could learn a few tricks from Huawei’s phones. Under the hood, the Mate 10 Lite is powered by Huawei’s own Kirin 659 chip (a 64-bit octa-core chip with 8x Cortex-A53 cores and 16nm design) with 4GB of RAM. This is a mid-range chip with about the same performance as the Snapdragon 625, meaning that it is a long shot from the performance level you get on flagships. In fact, in benchmarks it gets around half the score of a 2017 Snapdragon 820 chip. Gamers and specs geeks can take a look at the full benchmark testing results below to have a better idea of the phone's performance. The Huawei Mate 10 Lite we have up for review comes with a hybrid dual SIM card slot, so you can choose between using two SIM cards or one SIM + one microSD card. In terms of storage, you get 64GB on board, but since system files occupy some of it, only around 48 gigs are available for your apps and media. That's not ideal, but it is not a bad amount either since most phones in this price range only have 32GB of native storage. Plus, the option to expand via microSD cards is nice having. Internet and Connectivity Disclaimer: The Huawei Mate 10 Lite is not officially sold in the United States and. it does not support US 4G LTE bands. The Mate 10 Lite has 4G LTE connectivity with support for the following bands: FDD LTE: Bands 1, 3, 7, 8, 20 In simple terms, these bands will cover practically all European carriers and many international ones. Before buying one, check with your carrier to see if the Mate 10 Lite is fully LTE compatible with its bands. To access the web on the phone, you have Google Chrome on board as well as a selection of alternatives via the Google Play Store. Other connectivity options here include GPS, dual-channel Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.2, but there is no support for NFC. Camera A camera app with useful options and good image quality. In affordable phones like the Huawei Mate 10 Lite, camera and image quality are usually the biggest compromises made. Is the Mate 10 Lite a compromise like the rest in this? First, let’s look at its specs: the phone features dual cameras on the back and dual cameras up front. The secondary camera on both the front and the back is a 2-megapixel shooter that only helps get depth information and achieve a blurred background (aka “Portrait Mode” effect). The main camera on the back is a 16-megapixel shooter, while up front there is a 13-megapixel camera. The camera app itself is utilitarian and gets the job done. Unlike most phones, the shortcut to quick start is a double press of the volume down button, not the power key. The app has quite a few interesting options (swipe left from the edge of the camera app to open the settings) and while most of them are standard – timer, grid, smile capture, mute option, object tracking and so on – right at the bottom is one that stands out: “Image adjustment”. Here you will find that you can adjust the saturation, contrast, and brightness of images that come out of the camera. Pro tip: Photo enthusiasts will appreciate this option and after shooting with the phone for a while, we would bring the saturation and contrast up by 1 stop. To switch to a different mode of shooting, you swipe right from the left edge of the camera app. You will see a list where you have Pro Photo (you can shoot RAW on this phone) and Pro Video (you can control metering, EV, use manual focus and set a manual white balance). Huawei also include few cool options like Light Painting with which you can get creative and photograph car light trails, paint light graffiti, shoot silky-looking water or even do basic astrophotography. You also have a time-lapse mode and slow-mo videos, as well as photo panoramas and a few other modes including a useful document scanning option. Overall, the app is well done and functional.. 6.15 x 2.96 x 0.3 inches. 156.2 x 75.2 x 7.5 mm. 5.87 x 2.87 x 0.32 inches. 149.09 x 72.9 x 8.1 mm. 6.16 x 2.96 x 0.3 inches. 156.5 x 75.3 x 7.6 mm. 5.84 x 2.89 x 0.31 inches. 148.35 x 73.5 x 7.99 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Image: 1 of 14. Image Quality How do photos actually turn out?. Taking an HDR pic (sec) Lower is better. CamSpeed score Higher is better. CamSpeed score with flash Higher is better. We are quite happy with photos we get during the day as they look fairly detailed and sharp. Two things that could be improved, though, are contrast and saturation as by default colors are definitely on the bland side, lacking in vibrancy. If this was any other phone, there would be no way to fix this, but with the useful “Image adjustment” option in the camera settings you can just bump saturation and contrast by 1 stop and get much, much better looking photos. At night, this camera shows its weak side. It is hard to get a sharp shot and most of our snaps turned out very blurry and underexposed. No settings will help you here; this is just the way this phone is. You can try to hold it super steady or put it on a tripod for better shots, but this is not something that can always be done. The LED flash does the job, but not particularly gracefully. It’s not perfectly controlled and often creates terrible “laser-eye” photos. The front camera shoots very detailed selfies, but, as most front cameras, burns the highlights of an image quite badly. One thing that we notice is that skin tone always turns out way too pinkish and not perfectly accurate, though. Portrait and Wide Aperture Mode You have a portrait mode with both the rear and front cameras, so you candigitally blur the background to achieve a more creative effect. It all works very well, especially considering that this used to be a feature only available on more expensive phones. Of course, do not expect professional results, but for its small sensor, the Mate 10 Lite does great. We took some great-looking portrait-style photos with zero effort, and we like that we can adjust the amount of blur in a picture. We can go all the way to f/0.95 (simulation) that will bring true bokeh blur rings or go for a more natural-looking f/3.5 or f/4 setting. These last two optionsseem like the golden mean. And yes, you can get similarly good results with selfies. Take a look at the photos we shot below. Video quality Video recording quality is the most disappointing part of the Mate 10 Lite. First, the phone does not support 4K video resolution, but even the 1080p videos do not look great: they lack detail sorely, and highlights are very overblown. There seems to be some basic stabilization on board, but it is the quality of the footage that leaves a lot to be desired. Sound quality You have a single bottom-firing loudspeaker on the Mate 10 Lite. It’s a bit on the quiet side and just average in terms of quality, with no depth to it and a slightly squeaky tonality. Thankfully, there is a headphone jack on board, so you do not need to spend more than $100 on wireless headphones just to enjoy the sound. If you do have wireless headphones, though, the phone does support Bluetooth 4.2, so it will work fine (even though it lacks the latest 5.0 specification).. Huawei Mate 10 lite sample images.

Call Quality Call quality is good on the Mate 10 Lite. Voices in the earpiece sound natural and with sufficient quality, so that you can recognize who is calling easily. On the other end of the line, we do not have any complaints about the microphone outputeither. Battery life It will last you a day, but not much more. The Huawei Mate 10 Lite comes with a 3,340 mAh battery, which is about average for a device of its size. We did not have any problems getting through a full day, but not much more. More intense use might drain the battery even before the end of a longer day. Unlike some other phones at a similar price from last year (mostly Snapdragon 625 phones), the Mate 10 Lite does not break any battery life records. We also ran our battery life test on the phone, and it scored below 8 hours, a result that falls below the average by a slight, but noticeable margin. Another important aspect of the battery experience is charging times. Sometimes you need that extra battery boost during the day and you need it fast – during the lunch break, for instance. Unfortunately, the Mate 10 Lite is one of the slowest-charging phones we’ve tested. It has a 10-watt (5V, 2A) charger in the box and it takes a whopping 2 hours and 37 minutes to get fully charged. Here is how fast it recharged using the charger included in the box: 11% in 10 minutes 29% in 30 minutes 100% in 2 hours and 37 minutes There is no support for wireless charging. Price and alternatives The Huawei Mate 10 Lite is a mid-range phone. More specifically, it is priced at around €335 in Europe, making it more expensive than low-end phones like the Moto G5s Plus and Moto E4 Plus , but also cheaper than phones like the OnePlus 5T , Nokia 8 and Honor 9. What are its direct rivals you ask? Here are some: Moto X4 : €350 Sony Xperia XA2 : €350 HTC U11 Life : €335 Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) : €310 Apple iPhone SE : €320 Apple iPhone 6 : €350 Some older top-tier phones have also now fallen in price and can be purchased for about the same price as the Mate 10 Lite: two such options are the HTC U Ultra (€330) and the Samsung Galaxy S7 (€400). And yes, it costs half the price of flagships like the Huawei Mate 10 Pro (€800), Apple iPhone 8 Plus (€910), and Google Pixel 2 XL : €840. After using the Huawei Mate 10 Lite for a while, we are left with mostly positive impressions. The phone has a great price. It is build very solidly, it has a cool 2:1 screen with tiny bezels, and we are particularly impressed with the premium feel of the display glass. It runs smoothly in the daily grind, and with a few tweaks, its camera captures good images in daylight. The portrait mode also works surprisingly well, and the fingerprint scanner is blazingly fast and accurate. At the same time, the Mate 10 Lite does have some issues, the biggest ones being the rather poor video recording and low-light photo quality. The rest are annoyances rather than big issues: the outdated microUSB port used instead of the newer USB-C, the slightly clunky looks of the Emotion UI interface, the lack of the latest Android version and certainty about future updates, the just-okay battery life and the slow charging, and the lack of extras like water-proofing and wireless charging. If some of these sound a bit nit-picky for an affordable phone, it is because… well, the Mate 10 Lite is actually quite a good phone. Ultimately, it is a safe recommendation if you are looking for a well-rounded phone that does not break the bank.. (Mostly) Smooth performance in daily use. Nice 2:1 display with premium oleophobic coating. Emotion UI has some useful options. Outdated microUSB port rather than USB-C. Emotion UI icons and styling look outdated. Battery life is just okay, charging is slooow. No extras like water-proofing or wireless charging. UE Megablast wireless speaker Review 17 Jan. B&O Beoplay E8 Wireless Earphones Review 22 Jan.

And I am seeing more and more people with this and also the regular Mate 10, as both are offering much more for the price than the competition..

Here's it's mostly Samsung and Apple, but more Samsung due to it's being a lot cheaper here unless we are talking about flagships as well.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Huawei Mate 10 Lite review:. How many cameras do you need? This phone gives you 4. Huawei Mate 10 Lite (Graphite Black). Huawei Mate 10 Lite (Prestige Gold). Huawei Mate 10 Lite (Aurora Blue). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good Huawei’s Mate 10 Lite gives you enough power and a fantastic design, including a 5.9-inch screen framed by small bezels, for less than $400.. The Bad Its dual cameras on the front and back are more style than substance, and its battery life, while acceptable, could be better. It's also lacking NFC or water resistance.. The Bottom Line The OnePlus 5T is still the midrange king, but Huawei’s Mate 10 Lite is a great choice if you can get it.. There's a growing list of phones out there for you if you're not able or willing to spend big bucks on something from Apple , Samsung or Google. The OnePlus 5T ( $535.00 at Amazon.com ) , for instance, offers flagship performance from $499. If you just need the basics, Moto's G5 does everything for $229.. Now there's a new phone to add to this list, Huawei's Mate 10 Lite ( $308.99 at Amazon.com ) , a solid option in the middle of those other two phones. It officially retails in Australia as the Nova 2i for AU$499, which converts to $380 and £280. But if you're looking to import, which you'll have to since it doesn't have an official US or UK release, sites are offering it for around AU$350, which is more like $270 and £200. At that price, the Mate 10 Lite is a steal.. It has four cameras -- two on the front and two on the back -- though they're more show than go. That's OK though, because the Mate Lite also has a vibrant 2,160x1,080-pixel display, premium touches and more than enough power to browse the web and watch videos smoothly.. The Huawei Mate 10 Lite's price is just right. Dual cameras have become the in thing for phones over the past year. With the Mate Lite, Huawei doubles down on dual cameras by doubling up: The phone has dual shooters not only on its back (16 plus 2 megapixels), but on its front too (12 plus 2 megapixels).. This is all good and fun, but quantity only counts as long as there's quality too -- Google's Pixel 2 ( $639.99 at Amazon Marketplace ) , with its one rear lens, proved that. And since the biggest gap between midrange phones and premium ones is often camera quality, you shouldn't expect the world of the Mate Lite's cameras.. They're competent, and can shoot some decent photos in good light conditions. But they're not particularly noteworthy in any way, despite their number. They struggle in both high and low light: The former often leading to overexposure, and some of my low-light photos came out a little grainy. Plus, many pictures I shot looked artificially over-sharpened too.. The twin selfie cameras can blur your background out, and mostly do a good job of it.. The rear cameras can struggle though -- note the shoulder area. Both the back and front cameras tend to shoot overexposed pictures.. Still, it's nice to have both its front and back shooters capable of bokeh-style photos, which mimic the depth-of-field effect of a DSLR camera, even if it doesn't handle fine details like people's hair as well as other phones. Software can be a saving grace here: Huawei's tech lets you adjust the aperture after you take a portrait shot, meaning you can change how blurred the background is. This is helpful, because the phone blurs backgrounds too much as a default (see above photos). There's also a beautify option for the selfie camera, which is a common feature that softens lines for a smoother skin tone.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

Huawei Mate 10 Lite reported to have four cameras, 18:9 display, €379 price. Because three cameras are so early 2017.. Although we're getting dangerously close to the end of 2017, that doesn't mean we've seen all of the major smartphone releases for the year. Huawei is scheduled to host a press event on October 16 to unveil its latest product offerings, and we've already heard and seen a lot about the upcoming Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro. However, new information has recently surfaced regarding a third Mate 10 device – the Mate 10 Lite.. As you'd expect, the Mate 10 Lite is the least powerful of all the Mate 10 smartphones that'll be announced this coming Monday. Despite that, this is not a cheap or feature-lacking device. Just like the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro, the Mate 10 Lite will come equipped with an 18:9 display. The bezels surrounding the 5.9-inch 1080 x 2160 display aren't quite as thin as what's found on the Mate 10 Pro, but they're still considerably smaller than the Pixel 2's massive forehead and chin.. The phone should be powered by Huawei's Kirin 659 processor that's clocked at 2.36GHz, 4GB of RAM, and a decently-sized 3,340 mAh battery. There's also 64GB of internal storage, rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, and Android 8.0 Oreo with EMUI 5.1 layered over it.. In regards to cameras, this is where the Mate 10 Lite should really shine. Like a lot of other handsets released this year, the Mate 10 Lite features two cameras on the back – including a 16MP main sensor and a second 2MP one. Althgouh that might not be particularly exciting, the Mate 10 Lite kicks things up a notch by also being outfitted with two front-facing cameras. The front of the phone will house a 13MP and 2MP sensor, and this (combined with a toning flash) will supposedly allow for bokeh portrait shots with two people in the frame.. Following its announcement on October 16, the Mate 10 Lite is expected to go on sale about a month later for €379 (about $455 USD).. Dual cameras are the future, and the Huawei Mate 9 does it really well. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

Probably every Huawei flagship - be it P-series or a Mate - has had a trusted companion, a Lite version to complement - and... The flagship shines even brighter next to a less gifted stablemate. The Lite model in turn doesn't mind sharing some of the reflected light. It always works both ways and manufacturers are trying to get the best of it.. Few of the Lites have succeeded in capturing the essence of the main act though - content with living in the flagship's shadow. Now, the Huawei Mate 10 Lite claims to be different.. For the first time, we feel a Huawei Lite has been treated better than the usual repackage-and-discount routine. It's got a FullView widescreen, metal build, a pair of cameras on either side and the must-have large battery. It may be a Lite but it's a Mate, alright.. Huawei makes a big deal of the Mate 10 Lite sporting four cameras and technically that's not an overstatement. True, the secondary 2MP shooters serve purely as depth sensors in portrait and a number of custom aperture modes - they can't help in low-light scenes. But those pro-grade effects seem to be highly souight after and making them available on a Lite is a smart move by Huawei.. We were so impressed by the Mate 10 Lite's specs that we almost missed a few changes since the P10 Lite. For starters, the chipset might be newer, but it drops the 5GHz Wi-Fi support in favor of the newer Bluetooth 4.2. The FM radio and NFC are gone too, while the hybrid SIM slot is an acceptable, if not the best, solution.. Still, we are looking at a midranger here, and the Mate 10 Lite packs more than enough punch to get us excited. We like the minimalist, clean design and the Aurora Blue paintjob is sure to turn heads. The super wide screen and the bokeh effects are enticing enough as well, and we'll hold the Mate 10 Lite to its promise of long battery life. Indeed, we have a lot to explore so let's get the review started, shall we?. Phone and loudspeaker, apps, media, audio quality 7. Camera, image and video quality 8.

Huawei Mate 10 Lite launches in Europe, priced at €399. by Oliver Cragg November 6, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. With the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro have been grabbing all of the headlines, it’s been easy to forget about the Chinese giant’s other Mate device. No, not the Porsche Design Mate 10. I’m talking about its mid-range offering, the Mate 10 Lite.. Huawei has announced that the budget member of the Mate 10 family is now on sale in Germany for €399. This should pave the way for a wider European rollout in the coming days and weeks.. If you’re familiar with the Huawei Maimang 6 , you already know everything you need to about the Mate 10 Lite as this is another device rebrand for a European market.. Available in Prestige Gold, Graphite Black, and Aurora Blue, the Mate 10 Lite sports a 5.9-inch Full HD display with a 18:9 aspect ratio. This gives the Mate 10 Lite the same near bezel-less effect as the regular Mate 10 devices.. The device is powered by Huawei’s octa-core Kirin 659 chipset, backed by 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of internal storage (expandable up to 256 GB) and a 3,340 mAh battery. It also runs Huawei’s proprietary EMUI skin over Android Nougat .. Huawei sold over 100 million phones in the first three quarters of 2017. The Chinese Android phone manufacturer shipped more than 100 million devices through just the first three quarters of this year. In fact, it even passed Apple as the number two …. On the feature side, the phone’s biggest draw is its four cameras. That’s two dual-camera modules – one on the rear with a 16 MP and 2 MP sensor set-up, and a selfie snapper with a 13 MP main camera and a secondary 2 MP sensor.. The Mate 10 Lite’s specs and design are certainly nothing to sniff at considering its budget price tag, but it can’t quite compare with the full Mate experience.

Huawei Mate 10 Lite Smartphone Review. Daniel Schmidt ( translated by Martin Jungowski), 11/30/2017. Android ARM Smartphone Touchscreen Phablet. Apart from the display size, the Huawei Mate 10 Lite does not have much in common with its namesake, the Mate 10 Pro. The Lite costs less than half as much as the Pro and is a very alluring mid-range smartphone. Our extensive review is going to reveal not only its strengths but also its flaws..

The Huawei Mate 10 Lite, equipped with a 5.9-inch 2:1 IPS display, features the same mid-range SoC as the Nova 2, dual cameras front and back, a decently sized 3340 mAh battery that is nowhere near the Mate 10 Proâs 4000 mAh battery, 4 GB of RAM and an expandable 64 GB of storage (microSD). So far so good, but truth be told it does not really have anything in common with the. Similarly sized smartphones are scarce but there are quite a few rather interesting mid-range alternatives, such as for example the. BQ Aquaris X Pro , the. ZTE Axon 7 , or the slightly more expensive. Tough competition for the Mate 10 Lite - let us find out why it turned out to be a viable alternative either way, shall we?.

Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. Like its larger sibling, the Mate 10 Lite features a very respectable screen to body ratio. Thanks to its 2:1 display, it is fairly narrow and therefore easy and comfortable to hold. The phoneâs official thickness as specified by Huawei is 7.5 mm (~0.29 in), however we suspect this to be an average that was calculated by including the rounded edges as our measurements revealed a thickness of 7.65 mm (~0.30 in). At 1.35 mm (~0.05 in), the camera protrudes quite a bit from the aluminum case, and therefore the phone wobbles when placed face up on the table.. Manufacturing quality is very decent, with narrow and consistent gaps and a card slot that sits flush with the rest of the case that is made of aluminum on the outside and a rather flimsy plastic on the inside. Torsional forces do not result in any creaking whatsoever, but the case does flex noticeably even with only minor force applied. Applying force to the display panel itself will result in a minor ripple effect.. The Mate 10 Liteâs battery is not user-replaceable, and unlike its two namesakes the Lite is not IP certified for dust and/or water resistance. The card slot is of hybrid nature and can take either two SIM cards or one SIM card and one microSD card. The case itself is available in Graphite Black, Prestige Gold, or Aurora Blue..

The Micro USB port supports USB 2.0 and is incapable of video output. However, it does support OTG and thus external peripherals such as storage or input devices.. According to Huawei, the Liteâs microSD card slot supports microSD cards with up to 128 GB (SDXC). In theory, microSD cards even bigger than that should also work. MicroSD cards cannot be formatted as internal storage, but they can be configured as default storage device for new photos and other media files. Apps are however restricted to the Liteâs internal storage.. The Mate 10 Lite supports wireless communications via Wi-Fi Direct, Miracast, and Bluetooth 4.2 but lacks an NFC chip. With EMUI 5.1 on top of Google Android 7.0 Nougat the phone is a little bit out of date. The other devices in Huaweiâs Mate 10 series are already shipping with EMUI 8.0 on top of Android 8.0 Oreo. Huawei has announced an Oreo update for the 10 Lite but has not yet clarified when exactly that is going to happen. Our review unitâs firmware version was B100, and was updated to B120 shortly thereafter fixing a Wi-Fi problem we have encountered and bringing the security patch level more or less up to date (September 2017).. The user interface should already be familiar to Huawei users and is reviewed in further detail in our. The phone communicates via LTE Cat. 6 but only on a few select frequencies. And while the bands supported should work just fine in Europe, North American users will only be able to use band 5 on AT&Tâs 4G LTE network (2, 4, 5, 12, 17) since not any of T-Mobileâs bands (2, 4, 12, 66, 71) are supported. Suffice it to say that we had absolutely no trouble whatsoever with cell reception in a major European city.. Wi-Fi is also somewhat limited and restricted to 802.11b/g/n and thus the fairly congested 2.4 GHz range. Accordingly and not surprisingly, transfer speeds measured against our Linksys EA8500 reference router were fairly low overall and the Mate 10 Lite was far behind all of its competitors. At least Wi-Fi range was decent - even at a distance of 30 ft to the access point and with an exterior wall between the two devices surfing the web was still possible, albeit with noticeable delay..

Supported location services include GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou. Outdoors, location lock is obtained fairly quickly, but takes a while to figure out the devices exact position. We were able to obtain GPS lock even at the basement window, but it turned out to be rather inaccurate.. We determine a smartphoneâs GPS accuracy by taking it out on a bicycle ride together with a professional Garmin Edge 500 GPS with both devices recording the track. The Mate 10 Lite ended up doing a very decent job, and the recorded tracks were more or less identical on both devices.. The 10 Lite offers dual SIM capabilities in case one is willing to forgo a microSD card. Both SIM slots are 4G capable, but only the primary slot supports VoLTE. Support for Wi-Fi calling is included, and the phone app is the same as on the. Call quality was decent and solid with both conversational partners understanding each other perfectly fine. The deviceâs speakerphone worked decently as well, and the phone can be used hands free with only minor reverberations. However, noise cancelling is not the Mate 10 Liteâs strongest feature.. Huawei Mate 10 Lite: front-facing camera. The phoneâs front-facing camera features two sensors, 13 + 2 MP, and an aperture of f/2.0. The second lens is used primarily for the bokeh effect in portrait mode, which works very well and can be adjusted retroactively. Image quality was comparatively decent, but quickly deteriorated into the usual noisy mushiness in bad lighting conditions.. The rear-facing 16 + 2 MP dual camera offers a moderately higher resolution, but the same set of features. Aperture is slightly worse at f/2.2 and there is no optical image stabilization whatsoever. Photos taken in bright daylight turn out very well, but lack detail when zoomed in. Dynamic range is decent, but photos tend to be overexposed, particularly around large bright areas. Low light photos turn out bland but decent overall thanks to the dual cameraâs capability of capturing as much light as possible. Only when zoomed in does one notice the lack of detail and the resulting noise.. Both cameras support video capture in FHD (1920x1080) at 30 FPS with the main camera taking much better (autofocus) and more colorful and lively videos and the front-facing camera overexposing visibly. Recorded sounds are of decent quality, but suffer from a constant static.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. ColorChecker: reference color at the bottom of each square.. Under controlled and normalized conditions and with the help of our ColorChecker Passport we were able to discern that colors were fairly bright and vivid. Grays were slightly too warm and whites were too bright.. Our test chart photo was crisp and sharp overall with some frayed outlines here and there, particularly so with dark elements on a dark background. Nevertheless, the level of detail was acceptable, as can be seen in the center of the photo. Sharpness deterioration towards the edges was insignificant, but slightly more pronounced in the upper parts than around the bottom.. Included are a modular charger (5 V, 2 A), a USB cable, a headset, a SIM tool, a translucent protective case, a warranty booklet, and a quick start guide.. By default, devices sold in Germany come with a 24-month limited warranty while US customers are limited to seller warranties.. Huawei Mate 10 Lite with protective case installed - front. Huawei Mate 10 Lite with protective case installed - rear. The capacitive touchscreen supports 10-point multitouch input and was fairly reliable and precise during our tests. The glass surface is smooth and the factory-installed screen protector can be easily removed. The glass is a real fingerprint magnet but can fortunately be wiped off very easily and quickly.. By default, Huawei devices come with the SwiftKey keyboard which, as usual, can be replaced by any other keyboard from Googleâs Play Store. The physical buttons on the side are firm and tight, and their actuation is decent. Our only gripe was that they were quite hard to tell apart, which could have been mitigated by using different surface textures.. The fingerprint reader is located on the back and perfectly positioned. In our tests, it worked very fast and reliably, and in addition to user authentication it supports gestures such as scrolling or sliding down the notification area.. The 2:1 IPS Full View displayâs native resolution is 2160x1080, and the 5.9-inch panel is very crisp. Its average brightness of 457 nits is comparatively high and its black level of 0.3 nits comparatively low, resulting in an impressive contrast ratio of 1557:1. Results were similar during the APL50 test with enabled ambient light sensor. Overall brightness distribution was very even and homogenous.. 466 cd/m² 497 cd/m² 457 cd/m² 451 cd/m² 467 cd/m² 441 cd/m² 443 cd/m² 446 cd/m² 441 cd/m². 89 % Center on Battery: 467. cd/m²) ΔE Color 5 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 6.1 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.15.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. Color accuracy was determined with CalMAN and a spectrophotometer. The phone supports various color temperature presets or manual adjustment.. The white point was too cool in standard mode, but only slightly so. From all of its competitors, only the. managed to best the Mate 10 Lite. Quite often, the preset âwarmâ leads to a more natural color representation. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the Mate 10 Lite. While it is true that colors are more natural on âwarmâ, the maximum color deviations are much higher and grays turn out greenish instead, resulting in an overall sickly appeal. Color space coverage is comparatively small and geared towards the sRGB color space.. Grayscale (color temperature: standard, color space: sRGB).

This means that the measured response time is similar to the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Outdoor usability was very decent thanks to the impressive maximum display brightness. The Mate 10 Lite remains usable even in bright daylight, but tends to aggravate its users with its highly reflective display.. Viewing angles were decent overall, and we found no color distortions or ghosting even at acute angles. A slight deterioration in brightness was noticeable, and as mentioned before the reflections can get quite annoying.. Huawei Mate 10 Lite viewing angles.

That said, these three phones also come with a very different price tag. are much closer in terms of price yet both, the. Exynos 7880 , manage to outperform the Mate 10 Lite by up to 17%. GPU performance is even lower than on the Nova 2 given the Mate 10 Liteâs higher display resolution.. System performance is decent and the phone not only felt fast and smooth, but also performed quite well in the benchmarks without standing out. As expected, the more powerful smartphones performed better, and the X Pro was about as fast as the Mate 10 Lite thanks to its pure and clean Android. Only the Galaxy A5 was slower than the Mate 10 Lite.. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) Huawei Mate 10 Lite. PCMark for Android Work 2.0 performance score (sort by value) Huawei Mate 10 Lite.

Equipped with a mono speaker, the Huawei Mate 10 Lite offers a somewhat decent sound performance as long as volume remains at low to medium levels with fairly balanced mids and highs. Higher levels of volume result in increased highs and decreased mids. Lows (bass) are absent regardless of volume level. Unfortunately, Huawei has decided not to reuse the Proâs dual speakers, but at least at 86 dB(A) the single speaker is fairly loud.. Unlike the Nova 2, the Mate 10 Lite does not support high-resolution Bluetooth audio transmission via aptX. The 3.5 mm headphone jack worked as well as expected, and audio output was smooth and clear.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 35.2 42.6 25 32.9 41.4 31 37.2 37.6 40 31.7 39.6 50 39.6 37.8 63 28.3 31.8 80 27.3 30.6 100 26.9 31.2 125 26.7 29.9 160 24 32.8 200 20.9 39.6 250 20.9 45.8 315 19.5 49.8 400 18.5 57.3 500 17.5 58.4 630 17.5 59.8 800 15.7 62.3 1000 15.8 66.2 1250 16.6 69 1600 15.8 70.4 2000 15.4 72.4 2500 15.5 74.8 3150 16 76.4 4000 15.8 78.3 5000 16 76.1 6300 16.3 74.6 8000 16.3 76.8 10000 16.2 79.9 12500 16.4 72.7 16000 16.4 60.4 SPL 28.6 86.5 N 1.1 62.1 median 16.4 Huawei Mate 10 Lite median 66.2 Delta 2.1 12.6 30.9 29.3 30.9 26.2 29.1 26.2 28.6 27.8 28.6 29.8 32.6 29.8 28.8 26.7 28.8 26 28.8 26 24 24.9 24 24.8 24.7 24.8 30.7 22.1 30.7 29.2 20.8 29.2 36.1 20.1 36.1 41.7 19.8 41.7 48.7 21 48.7 53.3 21.7 53.3 57.4 20.5 57.4 62.6 21 62.6 62.1 18.4 62.1 65.7 17 65.7 67.7 17.3 67.7 66.9 15.2 66.9 70.3 15.5 70.3 71.2 15 71.2 73 14.9 73 78.5 15.1 78.5 81.3 14.6 81.3 73.9 14.6 73.9 73.1 14.6 73.1 72 14.6 72 60 14.6 60 48.2 14.6 48.2 86 28.8 86 57.3 1.2 57.3 median 62.6 HTC U Ultra median 17 median 62.6 12.2 3 12.2 31.6 41.1 25.4 40 25.3 36.7 32.9 36 33.6 35.6 31.6 30.6 28.4 32.9 27 33.8 20.8 41.7 22 44.4 21.3 48.4 20.8 50.5 21.2 56.6 19.4 62.5 19.5 66.2 17.7 66.1 17.9 74.2 17.8 77.3 17.3 74.3 17.4 73.8 16.7 71.8 17.2 69.3 18.2 69.5 17.9 66.5 17.6 61.4 17.7 55.8 17.8 54.5 17.9 59.9 18.1 52.2 18.2 49.5 30 83 1.3 50.1 median 17.9 Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 median 61.4 1.3 9.5 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

In review: Huawei Mate 10 Lite. Review unit courtesy of Huawei Germany.. The smallest and most affordable member of the Mate 10 family turned out to be very interesting indeed. Unfortunately, the competition in its chosen field is immense, and the Mate 10 Liteâs one and only unique feature is its 18:9 5.9-inch display with an excellent screen to body ratio. Further features include hybrid SIM, 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of internal storage that is expandable via microSD, and dual cameras on both sides of the phone. Overall, the package feels like a larger version of the. Nova 2 , and we liked the Mate 10 Liteâs front-facing camera better than the massive megapixel beast of the former.. Apart from its name, the Mate 10 Lite has little in common with the Mate series in general. It is, however, a fairly decent smartphone.. Panel size aside the Huawei Mate 10 Lite has little in common with the other two members of the Mate family. It lacks NFC, the battery is smaller, the SoC is much slower, the Leica dual camera setup is nowhere to be seen, aptX for high-resolution Bluetooth audio is not supported and instead of Super Charge it only supports QuickCharge.. All things considered, it still turned out to be a fairly decent smartphone, particularly for those who prefer their smartphone screens to be big and massive. We would have wished for fewer compromises when compared with its two larger siblings though, and battery life could have been a bit better to boot..

IPS matrix is common in both devices where Huawei Mate's 10 Lite is going to launch with 4 GB of RAM instead of 6 GB RAM while internal storage is limited to 64 GB instead of multi-variant. Chipset used inside the Mate 10 Lite is Huawei Kirin 659 which is selected to compete with Samsung. Li-Po 3340 mAh battery is fixed inside the belly of the smartphone and it is non-removable.

Huawei Mate 10 Lite breaks cover in full, with a total of four cameras and a ‘FullView’ display. Adrian Diaconescu September 21, 2017 3:56 am. It was less than 24 hours ago that crackerjack leaker Evan Blass revealed the codename of a fourth Huawei Mate 10 variant , further complicating the tale of a fascinating flagship phone family , and already, VentureBeat’s top mobile reporter is back to fill in the blanks.. Just as suspected, Rhone is nothing but the alternate moniker of a rather unique 5.9-inch upper mid-ranger set to go official in China soon as the Maimang 6, G10 or G10 Plus. Its very special features include a massive “FullView” display squeezed into the conventional chassis of a 5.5-incher, complete with FHD+ resolution (2160 x 1080 pixels), and a somewhat untraditional 18:9 aspect ratio.. Oddly enough, the Mate 10 Lite’s pixel count is expected to edge out the “standard” Full HD numbers of the regular Mate 10, which was pictured in the flesh by this same extra-reliable tipster a measly couple of days back.. Somehow, the rumored 83 percent screen-to-body ratio of the Huawei Mate 10 Lite looks less impressive than the standard Mate 10’s seemingly slimmer bezels translated into real-world product images, with an obvious difference in fingerprint sensor placement. Just imagine how much further can the Mate 10 Pro go in the fight against display borders.. But perhaps the most interesting and unique Mate 10 Lite feature is a camera arrangement composed of no less than four shooters. Two on the front, two on the back, bokeh effects all around, 2MP secondary sensors, as well as 16 and 13MP main rear and front lenses respectively.. No premium Leica enhancements, of course, as you’re merely looking at paying €379 ($455) on the old continent following an October 16 Munich announcement. The rest of the specs aren’t half bad either, including 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, octa-core Kirin 659 processing power, Android 8.0 Oreo software, and 3340mAh battery capacity..

Adrian has had an insatiable passion for writing since he was in school and found himself writing philosophical essays about the meaning of life and the differences between light and dark beer. Later, he realized this was pretty much his only marketable skill, so he first created a personal blog (in Romanian) and then discovered his true calling, which is writing about all things tech (in English)..

Today, a new rumor from Evan Blass (better known as @evleaks) at VentureBeat. has shed light on one of the smartphones in the Mate 10 series: the Huawei Mate 10 Lite.. Last year, Huawei launched 4 different variants of their Mate 9 device which included the regular Mate 9 , Mate 9 Pro, Mate 9 Lite, and the Mate 9 Porsche Design Edition. This year we have only learned details about three devices that are said to be a part of the Huawei Mate 10 series, though.

Internally, the Huawei Mate 10 will feature the HiSilicon Kirin 659 SoC with 4 x Cortex-A53 @ 2.36GHz and 4 x Cortex-A53 @ 1.7GHz, 4GB of RAM, 64GBs of internal storage, and a 3,340mAh capacity battery.

Huawei Mate 10 Lite is ergonomically designed. Huawei Mate 10 Lite features dual-lens selfie camera. It’s all about the selfie flash. Size: 156.2mm x 75.2mm x 7.5mm. Internal memory: 64GB with 48GB available. MicroSD card slot with support up to 256GB. Available colors: Graphite Black, Prestige Gold, Aurora Blue. The Huawei Mate 10 Lite is one of the newest additions to the Chinese smartphone maker’s line-up, and if you’re into taking selfies, this is one phone that should appeal to you. It sports both a rear-facing and a front-facing dual-lens camera, making it the first model from the company to have four cameras. As the name implies, it’s a “lite” version of the Huawei Mate 10 Pro , but don’t let that word “lite” fool you. There’s plenty of power under the hood.. ValueWalk got some hands-on time with the Huawei Mate 10 Lite, and it features a solid construction with a metal chassis and metal frame. The seamless unibody features curved edges and soft lines. The Huawei Mate 10 Lite sports a fingerprint sensor on the back, along with a flashlight. The phone comes in three colors: Graphite Black, Prestige Gold and Aurora Blue.. Under the hood, the phone runs on Huawei’s octo-core Kirin 659 chipset, which is made using a 16-nanometer process and clocks up to 2.36GHz. The phone has 4GB of RAM, which certainly doesn’t place it at the top of the heap, but it’s no slouch either. The smartphone comes with 64GB of internal storage, although that can be expanded via the microSD slot, which supports cards up to 256GB.. The Huawei Mate 10 Lite packs a 3,340mAh battery, which the company claims can last up to two days of so-called “ordinary” use. If you’re not a heavy user, this is certainly possible, but if you’re making good use of the four cameras on this phone, it probably won’t last that long. It takes less than three hours for the battery to reach a full charge.. At 5.9 inches, the FullView display is certainly quite large, although it doesn’t feel as large as it is. The company says it managed to make the 5.9-inch display feel more like it’s only 5.5 inches, and although that doesn’t sound like much, it does make a difference with the handling. Huawei also continued the trend of the high screen-to-body ratio at 83%, which is just a little bit higher than the iPhone X and about the same as the LG V30’s ratio. The aspect ratio is 18:9, and it is possible to run two apps side by side.. The company also designed the display to reduce eye strain, a technology it calls Eye Comfort 2.0. The display filters out 450nm blue light to do this and also automatically adjusts the screen’s brightness and color temperature according to the light around you.. Huawei also spent a great deal of time working on the phone’s audio, which sounds incredible thanks to the multiple algorithms it uses to fine-tune all the sound.. We saved the best of the Huawei Mate 10 Lite for last. This is the perfect phone for anyone who likes to take photos, especially selfies. The front-facing camera features a 13MP lens and 2MP lens with an aperture of f/2.0 and a Smart Selfie Toning Flash. Between the two lenses and the flash that’s designed especially for selfies, there’s certainly no doubt that this phone is the one that was created for selfie lovers.. The Smart Selfie Toning Flash is designed to make flatter you, even in low-light conditions or a dark environment. The Huawei Mate 10 Lite adjusts the flash automatically so that anyone can take professional-grade selfie photos—even if you’re not a professional photographer.. The flash features an 80% color rendering index, which is aimed at mimicking natural light as much as possible. As a point of reference, natural sunlight has a 100% color rendering index. The Huawei Mate 10 Lite captures accurate colors and skin tones.. One of the challenges in creating a flash for a front-facing camera is that they can look rather harsh and uneven, but the Huawei Mate 10 Lite has what the company calls a “Translucent Light Lampshade,” which aims to make the lighting look more even and natural. The selfie flash features a 120-degree angle that highlights more than just the face in the photo.. According to the company, the selfie flash on the Huawei Mate 10 Lite simulates what’s called the butterfly lighting technique, which is used by professional photographers in their own studios. The technique is one of the oldest lighting techniques in photography, and it’s named for the shadow that’s created under the hose.. To create this very fine detail, photographers had to take a shot underneath their light source. It’s generally used for glamor shots, which is why it’s the perfect technique to use for a selfie camera. It’s also a feature that the average person wouldn’t notice in a photo, and yet, it’s one detail that makes a difference in a portrait.. The rear-facing camera features a 16MP and 2MP lens. The 16MP lens handles the image rendering, while the 2MP lens is tasked with creating a professional-quality bokeh effect by capturing depth of field. The bokeh effect also makes images look more natural, and it can even be adjusted manually. Portraits are crisp and clear, and photos can be taken quickly and then readjusted later by changing the image focus. Various effects can also be applied.. The camera also supports live pictures, which are two-second moving pictures created from still photos.. The Huawei Mate 10 Lite just started landing in some markets this fall, so if you’re really into taking selfies, this is one phone that’s worth considering. In Pakistan, it’s priced at Rs 29,999..
