more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Nick Todorov. Android - Android + Sony - Sony +. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. “It’s just the right size!” – that’s what my girlfriend exclaimed when I presented to her the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact. Little did she know that behind its humble appearance was a tiny beast of a phone – one that had as much processing power as a top-of-the-line Android flagship. And there’s so much more to like about Sony’s latest pocket-friendly handset , but ultimately, is its price of $600 justified? Well, perhaps it is. Design Uninspiring with its boxy look, but sturdy and practical. So yes, as its name suggests, size is a key selling point for the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact. It easily fits into any pocket and single-handed use is never an issue – traits we can highlight in very few of today’s smartphones. Bonus points go to Sony for throwing in water resistance, and the dedicated camera button on the side acts as a wonderful camera shortcut. Yet one thing we’d change if we could is the power button – as it is almost flush with the phone’s right side, I can hardly feel its presence underneath my thumb. And that’s important when an otherwise quick and reliable fingerprint scanner is embedded in the said button. As is the case with recent Xperias, the Xperia XZ1 Compact sold in the US has its fingerprint scanner disabled. In our book, that counts as a major downside given the handset’s price point. Display An “okay” screen with sufficient resolution and great outdoor visibility. Whether you’re looking at it in real life or scrutinously inspecting its specifications, this isn’t a screen that will wow you. After all, a resolution of 720 by 1280 pixels is far from impressive at this point in time. But for a screen measuring only 4.6-inches in diagonal, these are more than enough pixels to produce a sharp, detailed image. Plus, the screen delivers excellent outdoor visibility even on a sunny day. Colors on the Xperia XZ1 Compact are nice and vibrant, but lean towards the cold side – whites appear more blueish than they should, and you don’t have to be an expert to notice. To compensate for this, I went to the Display Settings menu and manually tweaked the color reproduction until it looked fine to my eyes. There I found a nifty Glove Mode option, but didn’t see a double-tap-to-wake setting or a blue light filter.. 5.08 x 2.56 x 0.37 inches. 129 x 65 x 9.3 mm. 5.83 x 2.87 x 0.29 inches. 148 x 73 x 7.4 mm. 5.45 x 2.65 x 0.29 inches. 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3 mm. 5.86 x 2.68 x 0.31 inches. 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright).

If it's iphone's review they will complain about low-res screen with 'okay' quality, big bezel, old design, no fingerprint, overpriced, etc. But it's android so they will pretends the cons doesn't exist here.. (Posts: 1796; Member since: 14 Feb 2011). posted on 18 Oct 2017, 20:23. Seriously, you're going to nitpick at him for having those cons? I think you all are just taking this bias thing to heart sometimes. If you don't like this site, you could go to plenty of other ones. I like the XZ1 Compact and may be getting one when it comes down in price, but even I agreed with the cons. Just take a look at other sites cons and ask yourselves if he was really being all that biased:. TechRadar: only 32 GB of storage, tired design, no wireless charging. NotebookReview: aging design with large display bezels, photo quality not as impressive as sensor quality. Stuff: screen is still only 720p, camera has processing problems, bezels are on the big side. Recombu: Clunky dated design, no HDR display, buggy software. And even Android Authority, a site DEDICATED to promoting every Android device out there, reviewed the regular XZ1 and had these cons:. -NO FINGERPRINT SENSOR IN THE U.S. -Camera lacks dynamic range and is weak in low light. -Sony's UI doesn't mesh with Oreo. Congratulations, you have just proven what I thought I already knew: this site is now overrun with a bunch of hypersensitive fanboys that can't take any kind of critique whatsoever. Instead of just saying the guy must be an "iphone fan" why didn't you just counter the cons with an actual intelligible response?. EDIT: And on top of that, no site yet that has reviewed the XZ1 compact has given it a score above an 85. Most give about 4/5 stars or an 80 score which is just in line with this reviewer..

If double tap to wake was here, I think it wouldn't be one. The fact that there's no way to just check notifications or the time is a bummer. Not a dealbreaker for me but still a little annoying.. (Posts: 2840; Member since: 19 Jun 2012). posted on 18 Oct 2017, 10:26. Having use the XZ for quite a while, I am assuming that you've never owned any of the recent Xperia devices.... The power button/fingerprint is so good, that I never EVER need to see the lockscreen... My XZ does support tap to wake/sleep but I never use it... And 2 of the 3 cons of this review are subjective... (Posts: 1256; Member since: 15 Apr 2016). posted on 18 Oct 2017, 10:33. in response to #14 Hide. I think you missed my comment here saying that I own this phone... I agree about the speed but since Sony chose to remove the tap to wake/sleep in the new XZ1 and XZ1 Compact, it isn't there. A lot of the time, I just want to see what time is it and if I have any recent notifications. I don't always intend to lock my phone. True about the cons, I don't disagree at all there.. (Posts: 13; Member since: 13 Oct 2016). posted on 27 Oct 2017, 13:59. I went from an XZ to the XZ1 and yes double-tap to wake is an odd feature for them to have dropped. But there are enough good proximity sensor and accelerometer solutions in the Play Store to make it a non-issue.. (Posts: 237; Member since: 15 Nov 2012). posted on 18 Oct 2017, 09:52. Unfortunately this reviews tend to award pros and cons based on subjective matters. Though I'm impressed this got an 8, Sony devices usually get 1 or 2 points discounted just for having the Sony logo.. (Posts: 663; Member since: 16 Nov 2011). posted on 18 Oct 2017, 10:01.

Too bad the compact size is considered niche although there is a demand for this particular size. That's why people are buying iPhones solely for the size only.. (Posts: 2180; Member since: 06 Aug 2014). posted on 18 Oct 2017, 10:43. I'm currently in the iPhone camp (because of size, SE is perfect phone) but XZ1C is so tempting that with each day I like the idea of switching to it every day. I'm gonna watch every camera comparison with it, because it was always my main grip with Sony's phones. (Posts: 1256; Member since: 15 Apr 2016). posted on 18 Oct 2017, 10:49. I also have the SE but the XZ1C is great enough for me to give up the SE. I'm sure that camera comparisons will come soon though, if they aren't already present. Sony finally fixed their image processing.. (Posts: 2180; Member since: 06 Aug 2014). posted on 18 Oct 2017, 12:18. in response to #17 Hide. That's what I really, really hope for.

When it comes to smartphone sizes, bigger isn’t necessarily better. As such, Sony is one of the few companies still releasing smartphones that are on the smaller side.. The Xperia XZ1 Compact is the latest addition to the Compact series – but, unlike last year’s mid-range deviation, Sony is back packing flagship specs into a tiny 4.6-inch form factor.. So while you might be willingly sacrificing screen size for pocket-friendliness, you won’t have to give up on Snapdragon 835-level performance nor some of the camera tricks on offer from Sony’s more sizeable models.. It feels like quite some time now that Sony has been pedalling the same phone designs – for better or worse. And if you’ve held a Sony Xperia phone in the past odd years then you’ll largely know what to expect from the XZ1 Compact.. You’ll be in familiar territory with the squared off edges and sharp corners of the device. For a small phone, the XZ1 Compact is surprisingly thick at 9.3mm, but this lends it a robust feel. This is despite Sony moving away from the aluminium body of the Xperia XZ1 , replacing it with a woven plastic material.. Even though it’s plastic, the phone feels nice in your hands – and not at all cheap, as is often the case with such a finish. There’s a slight texture and roughness to it, which helps you keep a good grip of the handset. The black review model also didn’t pick up greasy fingerprints or micro-scratches – often an issue with metal or glass. If black isn’t your preference, the XZ1 compact is also available in silver, blue and pink.. Nowadays, there really aren’t many rival phones that can be used comfortably one-handed. Next to other modern phones, the XZ1 Compact looks adorably tiny.. I’ve got small hands and experienced no problems reaching the top and bottom of the XZ1 Compact’s screen. However, this isn’t without a degree of discomfort, as a result of the sharp corners and edges. Sharp enough to jut out of your pockets if you’re wearing tight jeans, or poke the palm of your hand in use.. There’s a thin sliver of what feels like metal across the top and bottom edge of the device. Having accidentally dropped the XZ1 Compact during the testing period on a hard gym floor, two of the corners are chipped as a result. This unintentional drop test suggest that the edges of the phone aren’t the most resilient, even if the rest of the handset feels well made..

There’s a volume rocker, which I’d have preferred was a little larger since it’s fiddly to use. Below this is the lock button, which is indented slightly to make it easier to find. It’s one of Sony’s embedded fingerprint sensors (at least on the UK model – no such luck in the US, oddly).. I found the scanner reliable and quick, although as is the case with most such units, wet hands still prove a struggle. I actually prefer it to both front and back scanners; it lets me unlock the phone quickly regardless of which way I’ve put the phone down.. Below the scanner is a tiny camera shutter button. It isn’t the greatest shutter button I’ve seen, since the actuation doesn’t really ape a proper shutter button in terms of feel or size. There’s a half-press function for autofocus, but it feels a little fiddly. The button acts as a shortcut to the Camera app, however, which can be handy.. On the left-hand side is the nano-SIM port and a microSD slot for upgrading the somewhat meagre 32GB of storage. Up top a headphone jack remains, and on the opposite end you’ll find a USB-C port for charging. Surprisingly, there’s no wireless charging option, despite the phone body being made from a material that would facilitate it.. IP68 waterproofing, however, which was disappointingly absent in the previous Xperia Compact phone.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

more ... more .... more ... more .... Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact, XZ1, and X1 might be announced in September. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact, XZ1, and X1 might be announced in September. by Florin Troaca. Tags :. Android - Android + Sony - Sony +. Sony already announced no less than five new smartphones this year: Xperia XZ Premium, Xperia XZs, Xperia XA1, Xperia XA1 Ultra, and Xperia L1. But the company seemingly has at least three more handsets to introduce before the end of 2017, and one of them is expected to be a new Xperia Compact. According to Georgian website Review.ge, Sony plans to announce the following phones at IFA 2017 (September 1 - September 7): Xperia XZ1, Xperia XZ1 Compact, and Xperia X1. It's said that both the Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact will be high-end devices, featuring Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and 4 GB of RAM - just like the already announced Xperia XZ Premium. However, the two new handsets should differ in size: the Xperia XZ1 reportedly offers a 5.2-inch 1080p display and a 3000 mAh battery, while the Xperia XZ1 Compact comes with a 4.6-inch 720p screen and a 2800 mAh battery. If these details are accurate, the XZ1 Compact will become Sony's most powerful 4.6-inch smartphone ever. To be fair, it kind of makes sense for a new Sony-made compact handset to be revealed at IFA 2017 in September, as this would arrive one year after the Xperia X Compact. Also of note is that two other previous compact phones - Xperia Z5 Compact and Xperia Z3 Compact - were also announced during IFA events. As for the third handset that Sony might showcase at IFA this year - the Xperia X1 - this is expected to sport a 5-inch 1080p display, further featuring a mid-range Snapdragon 660 processor, 4 GB of RAM, and a 2800 mAh battery. The three upcoming Sony smartphones will allegedly come with improved cameras, including new technology possibly dubbed "full pixel continuous" auto focus. By the sound of it, this could be better than the dual pixel auto focus currently used by high-end handsets like Samsung 's Galaxy S8. All in all, we're certainly curious to see what Sony has in store for the second half of 2017. P.S.: The source of this story, Review.ge, was previously correct in reporting that Sony would announce a Snapdragon 835-based 4K Xperia phone (namely the Xperia XZ Premium) at MWC 2017. That's why we think that the new details presented here could be accurate - although, of course, at the moment, we can't be sure of anything. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact on Amazon.

That would actually be great for those who love the Xperia Compact as the last iteration used midrange specs instead of those of the high end. I just wish they'd be more competitive against the iPhone SE when it comes to price. It shouldn't cost more than $499 and, if possible, they should offer a model at the $399 mark.

The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is a rare breed - it's small on the outside, but big on the inside. Packed with all the latest hardware and having only a small screen to power, Sonys latest super-mini may very well be the performance champion to beat. But whenever there is a superhero, there is a villain lurking in the shadows. So yes, the Compact has its own battle to fight thats not all about size or speed.. Three years ago, the first Xperia Z1 Compact did the unthinkable, taking the then flagship apart and putting it back together into a smaller, nimbler package. Sony eventually pulled the brakes with the X Compact last season but the XZ1 Compact is trying to make up for it and get back in the fast lane: the latest Snapdragon 835 chip, the flagship-grade Sony IMX400 camera with 960fps slow-mo vids, the elegant waterproof design, and Android Oreo right out of the box.. With a screen that size, the XZ1 has no business in the resolution race and the performance has the biggest gain. The XZ1 Compact is shaping up to be what the iPhone SE was to loyal Apple users and we can't wait to take this little beast out for a spin.. Although the Compact series have clearly evolved over the past few years, the screen resolution is still stuck at 720p. It's not that 319ppi is dismal but Sony shouldve moved on to 1080p instead of risk slipping behind the curve.. The generous screen bezels are something the entire Xperia XZ lineup needs to deal with. We wonder if theyre less annoying on a smaller scale, or is it one of those things that are easier for a mini to get away with than a flagship.. Anyway, the real question is, can the XZ1 Compact sell the super-mini concept to enough people in the times of borderless displays and pretty compact five-inchers? Lets see..

Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact final review: the triumphant return of the compact. Last year, Sony released its Xperia X Compact, a small mid-range smartphone.. Now, Sony is back with another compact smartphone, but this time it's a flagship.. In our final review, we explain exactly what this device is capable of.. Lowest price: Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact release date and price. The XZ1 Compact comes in all these colors, plus pink. Since the debut of its Xperia X3 Compact in 2014, the IFA has become an important date for the Japanese manufacturer.. Each year, Sony presents us with a new smartphone during the event, but unfortunately it. disappointed fans of compact smartphones last year, because the model presented was a mid-range device and not a high-end smartphone.. This year, with the XZ1 Compact, Sony is making a big comeback in the compact smartphone market.. We find in this small device almost the same material as in the high end of the series: the XZ Premium.. Having more powerful (and expensive) hardware obviously raises the cost of the device: while the mid-range X Compact cost $500. in 2016, the flagship XZ1 Compact costs $600.. That said, if you are looking for an Android flagship with a small size, you have no other compact alternatives. For this device, you get to. choose between black, silver, blue and pink colors.. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact design and build quality. At first glance, you don't get the impression of plastic. The XZ1 Compact is protected against water and dust. Regarding the design, Sony remains faithful to its Xperia XZ range.. The screen is HD and 4.6 inches, but unlike many flagships today, its bezels. This is due to the construction of the device and the components used.. The fingerprint reader alone takes up 1.5 mm of space on the edge of the screen (on the power button).. Above the camera, we can find the 19 MP. Motion Eye camera, with its 3-layer sensor, right next to the speaker.. On the lower edge of the screen we find the second speaker and the Type-C USB port.. Sony has learned from the past, and places the processor away from the photo sensor. That said, a heat conducting plate with a pipe was added to allow heat to escape the device, a useful thing for when you want to record video in 4K, for example.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is mostly plastic,. made more stable using carbon fiber.. The choice to use plastic wasn't about cost, it was. can be placed behind the rest of the equipment in the device.. This allows the Xperia XZ1 Compact to be compatible with. 4G Cat 15, which allows a download speed of up to 800 Mbit/s.. XZ Premium , only the top and bottom are made of metal. In any case, the Xperia XZ1 Compact is protected from dust and water according to IP65/68 certification, while the Xperia X Compact was not.. The big advantage of this smartphone is obviously its size.. Thanks to its compactness, it's easy to handle even with just one hand, which is a real treat.. Simple HD is more than sufficient for a 4.6-inch display. In terms of display, the XZ1 Compact offers what's usually found with. a screen of this size, so. don't hold your breath for a 4K screen or HDR on this 4.6-inch IPS display.. That said, with such a small screen. Sony offers HD definition with a maximum brightness of 600 nits. protection, this little Sony device uses the same glass as its upscale cousins: Gorilla Glass 5.. During our review, the screen performed well and was bright enough to use. in direct sunlight, but could also get dim enough to use in the dark without hurting your. As explained above, the great advantage of this device is its small size: with a diagonal of 4.6 inches, it is possible to use with just one hand without the slightest problem.. We find a little surprise software interface level.. Sony will offer this smartphone (and the XZ1) with Android 8.0 Oreo.. modifies the interface slightly by overlaying its UI, with which it isn't possible to access the app. drawer via a swipe from bottom to top, as it offers a more conventional launcher.. Sony offers several features to make it easy for new users to adapt to the system quickly.. Unfortunately, there are some small logical quirks in the interface that may make things less intuitive.. has to launch the new 3D scanner for the Motion Eye camera, while the other special features. of the camera are found in the photo app.. Fortunately, Sony learns from its mistakes.. On this version based on Android 8.0 Oreo, it is no longer necessary to use a specific, separate app to record videos in 4K: you can now enter the. camera app options and change the resolution there.. Thank you for a more intuitive solution, Sony!. With its high-end hardware, this device should be able to stand up to competing flagships. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact: benchmark results. 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.1. 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.0. 3D Mark Ice Storm Unlimited ES 2.0. The XZ1 Compact aspires to be a tiny. flagship so it must have high-end hardware to match.. configuration is identical to that of its brothers, the XZ Premium and XZ.. With a Snapdragon 835, 4 GB RAM and UFS memory, the XZ1 is exactly like the XZ Premium and the XZ1.. The only difference with the XZ1 is the size of its internal memory since the compact model only has 32 GB. Rest assured, this can be expanded up to 256 GB with a microSD card.. On paper, this smartphone seems to be able to stand up to other high-end models on the market.. We have submitted it to several benchmark tests. and can only note that it is as efficient as we imagined it.. In everyday life, the Sony Xperia XZ1 is incredibly fast and shows no sign of weakness. We didn't catch a single instance of slowing down.. The relatively low-definition display and its small size. certainly play a role in this, but the result is nevertheless a delight. and we are excited to finally find a flagship at this size.. If you are looking for a smartphone that's both compact and powerful, then this device is for you.. The headphone jack is here to stay. As for the sound, Sony has always been a winner.. Just look at the history of the brand and its other products, we can quickly see that the Japanese giant has proven itself with Sony Music and its legendary. With its stereo speakers on the front of the device, the Xperia XZ1 Compact shows its muscles.. Of course, and like many larger smartphones, it lacks a loudspeaker. worthy of its name in order to offer good bass, but if we take into account the size of the device the result isn't bad.. From a technical perspective, Sony pulled out all the stops for this device: Bluetooth 5.0, HD aptX, High-Resolution Audio, LDAC, etc... This is the combination that Sony always puts in its high-end smartphones.. Of course, the user needs to use the necessary, compatible hardware to be able to get the best quality, be it a HiFi system, headphones or headphones.. The camera of the XZ1 Compact comes from the XZ Premium. This smartphone can be used as a 3D scanner. At the main camera level, the Xperia XZ Compact has once again been inspired by the XZ Premium. Nothing changes at the hardware level, but Sony has worked on its software. The "Predictive Shoot" feature is now triggered with a simple smile (as long as someone is in its field of view). In addition, there is also a hybrid prediction autofocus, which will keep the focus on an object moving over a series of shots. it's possible to take up to 10 frames per second. Sony has also placed something of interest in the front camera: it has two focal lengths, one of 12.5 mm and. 120 degrees, the other of 28 mm and. The latter is achieved by interpolation and trimming of the image. In order to be able to take good. selfies in a dark environment, the entire display can be used as a flash.. The Motion Eye Camera can use an app by Sony to analyze objects in 3D.. From faces, heads, foods or other objects, you can create objects in 3D with a little practice.. You can then share these digital objects with your friends, from simple images to animated GIFs or MP4 videos.. As Sony records 3D objects in. OBJ format, it is also possible to use them with a 3D printer to create real objects in 3D.. As my colleague Luca said in his review of the Xperia XZ1 , there's a learning curve for this feature. for the average user, 3D scanning. will be something fun to try and get the hang of, but not something one. Only USB 2.0 is supported, but there is a USB Type-C port and Quick Charge 3.0. No Quick Charge in the box. The XZ1 Compact shares many of the same. technical specs as another device introduced by Sony at the IFA: the XZ1.. This is also the case with the battery, as even the rather large XZ1 has. has adaptive charging with Qnovo and support for Quick Charge 3.0.. With a screen resolution lower than that of the Full-HD XZ1, 5.2 inches, the battery life proves sufficient.. It's a shame that Sony has been so stingy: there is no Quick Charge charger in the box.. If you want it, you have to spend even more money.. of the XZ1 Compact is good.. On the PCMark benchmark, at maximum brightness, it still managed to hold for 6 hours and 35 minutes.. At 50% brightness, it manages to hold for 14 and a half hours.. In everyday life, the phone managed to last through. until the evening still with 30%.. from one person to another, so your mileage may vary.. It should be noted that since the Xperia X, Sony's smartphones have Qnovo charging technology.. In the settings, you will find the option in the battery settings.. When activated, the system will analyze the charge and adapt it at night to wait to reach 100% just before you wake up.. The battery is quickly charged and as soon as the level drops sufficiently, a new charging cycle begins.. As each cycle affects the life of the battery in the long run, the batteries of Sony devices have a much longer life by default.. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact technical specifications. 129 x 64 x 9.3 mm. 1280 x 720 pixels (319 ppi). There's simply no direct competition for Sony's XZ1 Compact, which combines a small size with big power. While it is true that it has only 720p definition, for a screen size of 4.6 inches, that's not a problem at all. What can hinder it, however, is the quality of the camera: despite the 3D scanner and SuperSlowMotion mode, it didn't. If you are looking for a compact smartphone that has the technical potential of a true flagship, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is the one for you!. Great to see a review that really appreciates Xperia Compacts for what they are: powerful, human hand sized phones with good battery life. Tired of idiot reviewers trying to goad Sony into, for example, crippling battery life by ramping up the pixel density/making the screen a pointless 1080p. i'd love a compact with a S8 screen ratio. The 4.6" screen is nice but when you have bezels that big top and bottom, it becomes essentially the same size as the LG G6 which fills its screen. If that same 4.6" screen filled its screen borders, then it would truly be compact.. MWC 2018 live updates: the Galaxy S9 struts its stuff. * Please enter a valid email address. Almost done!

Read our hands-on Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact review Design Display OS and power Camera and battery Price Takeaway All the latest news, launches and first looks from IFA 2017 in Berlin. Sony is one of the only companies still making fairly high-end compact phones, but it’s been a year since its last one, the Sony Xperia X Compact – and that phone didn’t impress us as much as some of its earlier small-screeners, so fans of compact handsets haven’t had much to get excited about lately.. That could all be changing though, as Sony has just announced the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact , alongside the Sony Xperia XZ1 .. But just how different is the XZ1 Compact to the X Compact? And was it worth the wait? To help answer those questions we’ve put the two phones head to head.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact has a glass fiber weave plastic back. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is constructed from glass fiber weave plastic, giving it a different look and feel to the ceramic-like plastic on the Sony Xperia X Compact.. It’s going to largely be subjective as to which is better, but otherwise these are very similar-looking phones, with a similarly rectangular design and a distinctive power button on the side that incorprates a fingerprint scanner (unless you’re in the US).. The two phones even have the same dimensions of 129 x 65mm. However, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is marginally slimmer and heavier at 9.3mm thick and 143g, compared to the Xperia X Compact’s 9.5mm and 135g.. Perhaps the biggest design win for the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact though is that it’s IP68 certified dust- and water-resistant, so it can survive the rain or even submersion.. Waterproofing is a common feature on high-end Sony phones, but it's lacking from the Sony Xperia X Compact.. The XZ1 Compact also sports dual S-Force front surround speakers for 50% more sound pressure than the X Compact.. There's a small 4.6-inch 720p screen on the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact. At 4.6 inches the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact certainly has a small screen by modern standards, and at 720p it's not overly high-resolution, but the small size ensures it’s still fairly sharp.. However, that’s exactly the same setup as the Sony Xperia X Compact, so there’s little to choose there. Either of these phones will be easy to operate with one hand.. We had no real issues with the Xperia X Compact's screen, despite its relatively low resolution, and in our early tests we've found the XZ1 Compact's display to be similarly high-quality.. The Sony Xperia X Compact is pictured here. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact comes with Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box, while the Sony Xperia X Compact is still on Android 7.1.1 Nougat and it’s not known if or when it will be updated.. The XZ1 Compact is also more powerful, sporting a high-end Snapdragon 835 chipset and 4GB of RAM, compared to the mid-range Snapdragon 650 chipset and 3GB of RAM in the Sony Xperia X Compact.. Both phones also come with 32GB of storage and a microSD card slot with support for cards of up to 256GB.. The Xperia XZ1 Compact has a 19MP rear camera with impressive video skills. There’s a 19MP camera on the back of the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact, just like on other recent Sony flagships. And while it’s a lower megapixel count it can likely be considered an upgrade on the 23MP one on the Xperia X Compact.. It’s capable of 4K video recording and super slow-motion shooting at 960fps, neither of which can be matched by the Sony Xperia X Compact’s video camera, which tops out at 1080p.. The Xperia XZ1 Compact also has an 8MP lens on the front and it’s a super wide-angle one, so you can fit more in your shots. The Sony Xperia X Compact on the other hand has a more conventional 5MP front-facing snapper.. Both phones have a 2,700mAh battery though, so there’s no change there. We’ll be sure to put the XZ1 Compact’s fully to the test in our review, but the X Compact is quite a long-lasting phone, so we’re hopeful that its successor will be too.. The Sony Xperia X Compact, pictured here, is likely to cost less than the XZ1 Compact. There’s no word yet on what the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact will cost, but the Sony Xperia X Compact launched at $499/£359 (around AU$635) so the Xperia XZ1 Compact is likely to be similar. You can now find the Xperia X compact for around $100/£100 less than that though.. With a much higher-end chipset, more RAM, dust and water resistance, a likely better camera and a tweaked design, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact sounds on paper like it could be the phone we hoped the X Compact would be.. Of course, how good it is in practice remains to be seen – we’ll let you know when we put it through our full review. It’s also not an improvement in all areas, with the screen and battery size remaining much the same, while the XZ1 Compact will also likely cost more to get hold of.. Still, if you’ve been holding out for a compact flagship this could be the phone to buy.. IFA 2017 is Europe's biggest tech show.

With a 4.6-inch screen, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is the smallest, most powerful premium Android phone.. Editor Rating: Excellent (4.0) Oct 25, 2017. Small Android phone with high-end specs. With a 4.6-inch screen, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is the smallest premium Android phone.. For years, we have been dreaming of a small, truly premium Android phone. Sony is bringing it to us. The Xperia XZ1 Compact ($599.99 unlocked) is the first sub-5-inch, no-compromise Android device in years. Along with its big sibling, the Xperia XZ1 , the Compact is positioned as the best one-handed phone for anyone into 3D printing, with a really cool 3D-scanning app that will eventually let you share 3D photos on Facebook. It's also powered by a screaming-fast Snapdragon 835 processor, making it the most powerful small Android phone you can get.. The XZ1 Compact isn't striking at first glance: It looks like just another little plastic-bodied Sony design (although it isn't plastic per se, but a sort of glass-infused polymer). It measures 5.1 by 2.5 by 0.4 inches (HWD) and weighs 4.9 ounces, so it's considerably smaller and slimmer than even narrow phones like the Samsung Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces), although it has a more traditional 16:9 screen aspect ratio. In that regard, it's more similar to the tiny iPhone SE (4.9 by 2.3 by 0.3 inches, 4.0 ounce), despite being just a tad bigger and heavier overall.. View All 9 Photos in Gallery. The phone fits comfortably into the hand and reaching across the screen or from top to bottom isn't a problem. It has the same button and port configuration as the XZ1, with a volume rocker, power button, and camera shutter on the right side. The left side has a SIM/microSD card slot that worked fine with a 256GB card. A 3.5mm headphone jack is up top, and a USB-C charging port is on the bottom. Like its larger sibling, the Compact is rated IP68, so it can survive in up to six feet of water for 30 minutes. Unfortunately, there's no fingerprint sensor in the US.. Left to right: Xperia XZ1, Xperia XZ1 Compact. Front and center is a 4.6-inch, 1,280-by-720 IPS display. That resolution is lower than most Android phones, but it's fine for the size, at 319 pixels per inch. That's not quite as pixel-dense as the 4-inch iPhone SE (326ppi), but the difference is academic. Text and graphics look fine, and there's no pixelation. Like the XZ1, the Compact has the same Triluminos display that gives it vibrant colors and customization options for color temperature, but HDR 10 is only supported on the larger model. Viewing angles and brightness are good, though the screen is reflective under direct sunlight.. The Compact supports GSM carriers, but LTE speeds are stopped down a bit lower than on the bigger phone. While the XZ1 can hit gigabit speeds on AT&T and T-Mobile, the XZ1 Compact is specced for 800Mbps. During our testing in midtown Manhattan, we experienced strong network connectivity on T-Mobile, with download and upload speeds ranging between 15Mbps to 20Mbps.. The phone supports Wi-Fi on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. There's also NFC, but because there's no fingerprint sensor you can't use it for Android Pay.. Sony has a long string of buzzwords to describe the phone's audio capabilities. The most important is probably AptX HD, which means you get crystal clear audio over Bluetooth 5.0 headphones and speakers. Testing it with the Bose QuietControl 30 for Bluetooth playback and Meze 99 Classics for wired listening delivered clear, crisp sound with rich bass. A pair of stereo speakers on the front give you loud audio with a good deal of depth.. The XZ1 Compact benefits from strong noise cancellation, resulting in clear transmissions free from background noise. Earpiece volume is loud, as is the speakerphone.. The XZ1 Compact has a Snapdragon 835 processor under the hood with 4GB of RAM, meaning this little phone doesn't make any compromises on power. In the AnTuTu benchmark, which measures overall system performance, it scored a solid 154,837.. That's a little surprising though, because the Snapdragon 835 paired with a 720p screen should eat benchmarks for breakfast, but the Compact fell slightly short of the XZ1 (165,553) and Galaxy S8 (173,609). We noticed it warming up a bit when running benchmarks and playing games, something we didn't encounter with the XZ1. It's possible Sony is throttling the processor to keep the temperature down.. That said, benchmarks are just part of the performance story. In actual usage, the XZ1 Compact is snappy, handling multitasking and demanding games like GTA: San Andreas without any slowdown. Generally, you get the same overall performance as the larger sibling.. The phone clocked 5 hours, 40 minutes when we streamed full-screen video over LTE at maximum screen brightness. Compared with the Google Pixel 2 (8 hours, 45 minutes), it's not particularly impressive for a smaller phone. Fortunately, the XZ1 Compact is packed with a number of battery- saving features that help extend screen time by disabling connectivity and reducing brightness and performance. Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 is supported for fast charging.. Like the XZ1, the main camera is 19 megapixels. It takes clear, sharp shots in most lighting conditions, and also fares decently in low light. Color reproduction is good, and we saw little difference in overall picture quality between it and the XZ1. 4K video is stable at 30fps, and the camera can capture stunning 960fps slo-mo.. The 8-megapixel front camera, meanwhile, can switch between wide-angle and regular formats, and the wide-angle mode was able to fit two extra people into group selfies in testing. There's some mild barrel distortion around the edges of wide shots, but it's a small price to pay for being able to get everyone in.. By far the coolest feature, though, is 3D scanning. This is the first phone (along with the XZ1) with sensors that collect data that can be used by 3D display apps, printers, and potentially games that support 3D models. The preloaded scanning app relies on the phone's Motion Eye sensor, which stacks memory directly under the camera so it can transfer a lot of data at once. Its default modes scan faces, heads, food, and free-form objects. It does quite a good job, as you can see here.. To share a scan, you can export it as a. OBJ file, but it becomes smoothed-out, monochrome, and upside down. You can edit the final result before sharing it to a 3D printer or printing service. Sony says it's working on direct connections to social networks and games, to let you post objects in Facebook's 360 video format, for instance.. The XZ1 and XZ1 Compact are among the first phones we've seen running Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box. Sony's Xperia UI is running on top, but aside from some minor visual tweaks with widgets and app icons, it sticks pretty close to stock.. Preloaded apps consist of the standard Sony fare like PlayStation and Movie Creator, along with AVG Protection, Facebook, and Spotify. None of them can be uninstalled, leaving you with 22.07GB of storage available out of a total of 32GB. A microSD card is always an option if you need more space.. For $600, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is the most powerful Android phone you can comfortably use with just one hand. That's increasingly rare to find, and combined with its high-resolution audio and 3D scanning capabilities, the XZ1 Compact is a viable alternative to the pricier Galaxy S8. But if you're not tied to the Android ecosystem, the $399 Apple iPhone SE is still the small phone we most highly recommend. Sony's challenge, as always, will be to sell the XZ1 Compact in a market where very few people buy unlocked phones that aren't from Apple, Google, or Blu.. Bottom Line: With a 4.6-inch screen, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is the smallest, most powerful premium Android phone..

Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact Smartphone Review. Manuel Masiero ( translated by Ariana Brodsky), 12/08/2017. Android Smartphone Touchscreen. Housed in its little 4.6-inch case, the Sony Xperia XZ1 embraces an understated style. But underneath that unassuming exterior lurks a full-fledged, high-end smartphone that can compete with the likes of the Apple iPhone 8 and other heavyweights. It is also one of the first smartphones to run Android 8.0. Here you will find everything you need to know about this little Sony powerhouse..

In those few words, Sony sums up the virtues of their Xperia XZ1 Compact. As the product name indicates, the 4.6-inch Android device is one of the smaller smartphones on the market; but inside, it is one of the giants. Snapdragon 835 â the manufacturer's fastest SoC to date â an. Adreno 540 GPU, and 4 GB of RAM, the Xperia XZ1 Compact is unquestionably a high-end smartphone.. Officially, Sony is charging 599 Euros (~$700; American version $599) for their mighty little device. Is that too much, or is the price justified? Our review seeks to answer that question as we compare the Xperia XZ1 Compact with a few other high-end smartphones that run on the same SoC â the OnePlus 5. We also weigh the new Sony device against the Samsung Galaxy S8. Apple iPhone 8 , both of which offer a similar level of performance to our test candidate. Finally, no review of the Xperia XZ1 Compact would be complete without a thorough comparison against its 5.2-inch sister model, the Xperia XZ1 .. Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (8998) Qualcomm Adreno 540.

Smartphone design is a matter of taste. We bring up this truism here because one person's opinion of the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact's unusual case may very well be the polar opposite of another's. With its boxy look, the Xperia XZ1 Compact is reminiscent of a mobile device from times past. But like a wolf in sheep's clothing, a top-tier smartphone is hiding unsuspected under this plain exterior.. Sony has packed the 4.6-inch device into a well-manufactured rectangular case. The soft edges that are ubiquitous in today's smartphone market are nowhere to be found; only the long sides are slightly tapered. The sharp edges on the short sides are hardly suggestive of a luxury class device. With this austere design, the smartphone is not exactly comfortable to hold either.. The relatively broad frame above and below the display takes some getting used to as well. The fact that it is even broader at the bottom (almost 1.5 cm/~0.6 in) than at the top (around 1.3 cm/~0.5 in) does not make a great deal of sense, given that the Android keys are not physical buttons, but on-screen elements. The smartphone's boxy design also makes it feel substantially thicker than 9.3 mm (~0.37 inches).. That said, there are many aspects that are beyond criticism in terms of the casing. For one thing, it is IP65/68 dust- and water-resistant. Sony has also mounted the Xperia XZ1 Compact's camera flush with the case, so the device can lie flat on level surfaces without wobbling around. The camera on our test device's sister model, the Xperia XZ1, lacks this agreeable quality. The case's stability is faultless as well â all our attempts to twist or otherwise warp the Xperia XZ1 Compact were futile..

Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, integrated Adreno 540. graphics chip and 4 GB of main memory, the Xperia XZ1 Compact is a very fast smartphone. The storage space, on the other hand, is... Of the nominal 32 GB of storage, Android 8.0 and the pre-installed apps already eat up 9.3 GB, leaving less than 23 GB available to the user. However, a microSD card can add up to 256 GB worth of space. Because the microSD card can only be formatted as portable storage, only media files can be stored there â no apps. A nano-SIM slot is located directly adjacent to the microSD slot.. The USB port supports only 2.0 speeds, but its rotationally-symmetrical Type-C connection allows the user to plug in cables and devices without worrying about the proper orientation. Additionally, the smartphone supports Quick Charge 3.0 and USB-OTG, enabling it to interface well with external storage and input devices. The power button doubles as a fingerprint reader.. Right: shutter release, volume rocker/zoom button, power button/fingerprint reader. The Xperia XZ1 Compact runs the new Android 8.0 Oreo operating system. Given that the successor to Android Nougat has yet to find its way into almost any other smartphone, whether straight out of the factory or by means of an update, the Xperia XZ1 Compact is one of the very first devices to run the new OS. Sony has left the brand new Android system almost entirely as-is, just throwing in a few proprietary apps such as Xperia Lounge. When we wrote our original review, the security patches were dated October 1st 2017 â thoroughly up-to-date at the time.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The Xperia XZ1 Compact is equipped with a modern communications module that supports the WLAN standard 802.11ac, NFC, Bluetooth 5.0 and LTE Category 15. The latter brings the smartphone's download speeds to up to 800 MBit/s, while upload processes take place at up to 80 MBit/s. Unfortunately, Sony does not specify which frequencies the wireless module supports. We can attest that within our rural Vodafone network, the reception was always stable and clear.. Thanks to MIMO technology and the smartphone's support for the 5 GHz frequency band, the Xperia XZ1 Compact received data from our Linksys EA8500 reference router at a breakneck 521 MBit/s â one of the highest speeds of any device on the market. When transmitting, the Sony phone even reached up to 669 MBit/s, landing first place in our ranking..

The Xperia XZ1 Compact determines its current location by means of GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou. In our tests, these systems enabled the smartphone to ascertain its position quickly and with an accuracy of up to 3 meters (~10 ft).. In order to test the smartphone's positioning abilities in everyday use, we took it on a bike ride along with our professional navigation device, the Garmin Edge 500. En route, the Xperia XZ1 Compact occasionally showed us cycling through the walls of a building or pedalling through greenery rather than along the bike path. But overall, the GPS is so precise that it recorded almost the same exact route as the Garmin Edge 500. Any high-end smartphone should perform this well.. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact: Turning point.

The Xperia XZ1 Compact is a good phone for making calls. If you hold the smartphone to your ear, both sides of the conversation are clearly audible and easily intelligible, even in louder environments. In quieter surroundings, voices emanating from the speaker are also easily understood. Both normal calls and conversations over speakerphone were accompanied by a small amount of static, but this was hardly noticeable and not at all bothersome.. The Xperia XZ1 Compact is equipped with a 19 megapixel camera with a Sony Exmor RS chip and f/2.0 aperture. Xperia XZ1 has the same camera. There is neither a dual camera nor optical image stabilization. Still, in good lighting, the 19 megapixel camera takes good shots. The images' natural colors are especially appealing. Unfortunately, fine details tend to appear a little washed out. In less optimal lighting environments, the lens still does its job well, even if the image noise does intensify.. The Xperia XZ1 Compact also scores points for its camera module's 3D scan function. Alongside Android 8.0, this is certainly one of the smartphone's unique selling points. The 3D app, called 3D Creator, comes pre-installed and can be used to create three-dimensional images (of faces, for example). The app includes a comprehensive tutorial, and during a 3D photo shoot, tips and suggestions are listed on the side of the screen. After a short period of training, we managed some shots that were not half bad. Once completed, these 3D scans can be embedded in a video, made into a GIF, or posted on social networks.. Shots with the webcam in weak lighting. Another special feature of the camera is its super slow motion recording capability. In this mode, it can capture 960 frames per second. â but it cannot take shots at any resolution level higher than HD, and the image quality is not very good. Conventional video recordings, on the other hand, can be taken at up to 4K resolution and 30 frames per second. The 8 MP front camera is fitted with a 120 degree wide angle lens. In good lighting, this lens also takes good shots. It comes with useful features for selfies, including smile recognition and the ability to automatically track a moving object (object tracking). In the camera menu, the user can also activate AR effects and place virtual objects in photos. For example, you can put a pirate's hat on someone's head, let fish swim through the picture, or add comic book effects like laser eyes. However, in poor lighting image noise creeps in quickly here too.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. We always conclude our camera tests by analyzing the camera's performance under controlled lighting conditions. We evaluate the image colors with X-Rite ColorChecker Passport, and assess the image sharpness with our test chart.. In terms of color representation, the Xperia XZ1 Compact means well. With the exception of light gray tones, the smartphone always renders colors a little too intensely â but not so much as to be over-the-top. The results still look good here. Capturing images with the correct level of sharpness is a real challenge for our smartphone. Transitions between image structures are at times fringed, at times blurred â but never pin sharp.. ColorChecker Passport: The actual colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. Test chart (click for the original). The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact comes with a modular power supply (5V, 1.5A), a USB Type-C cable, headphones, and a quick start guide. On Sony's accessories website , you can buy a cover with a kickstand (SCSG60), a stereo Bluetooth headset (SBH24), and a stereo headset (STH32), among other things.. In Europe, the Xperia XZ1 Compact comes with a 24-month warranty. Accessories, including the battery and charger, are under warranty for just one year. The EU's 2-year retailer's warranty applies independent of Sony's coverage. The US version comes with a 12-month warranty.. A smartphone with a form factor of just 4.6 inches has become a rare species on today's market â and that is especially true among the top tier. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact scores points right away here, seeing as its compact size makes it very easy to use one-handed. The fingerprint reader built into the power button unlocks the smartphone quickly and reliably.. Everything runs smoothly internally as well â and no wonder, given that the Xperia XZ1 Compact has such powerful hardware at its command: a Snapdragon 835 SoC, 4 GB of RAM and quick UFS memory. The smartphone reacts to input instantly, apps start up quickly, and the process of switching between apps takes place without any noticeable lag. The SwiftKey keyboard serves as the standard keyboard for the Xperia XZ1 Compact.. The Xperia XZ1 Compact's IPS display operates at HD resolution (a "low" 1280x720 pixels), reaching a pixel density of 319 PPI on its diagonally-measured 4.6-inch screen. Xperia XZ1 , offers a little more here: 1920x1080 pixels and 424 PPI.. With a pure white background, the Xperia XZ1 Compact's display glows at a very bright 560.4 cd/mÂ² on average, even reaching up to 567 cd/mÂ² in some spots. With bright and dark areas spaced out evenly to create more realistic image content (APL50), the screen's maximum brightness of 559 cd/mÂ² is almost just as high. The Xperia XZ1 Compact's brightness distribution is 98% across the screen â a remarkably good result. In order to go easy on the user's eyes, by default the smartphone automatically adjusts its brightness level in proportion to the ambient light.. With a black value of 0.53 cd/mÂ², the screen is not able to display dark areas of images as fully black â such is life with an OLED display. But in terms of its contrast ratio (1068:1), the IPS display still does its job well. From a subjective perspective, colors look vivid and crisp.. The display has just one clear shortcoming: At brightness settings of 25% or less, the screen exhibits PWM flickering. This could cause eye problems and/or headaches in sensitive users.. 553 cd/m² 553 cd/m² 559 cd/m² 556 cd/m² 566 cd/m² 562 cd/m² 565 cd/m² 563 cd/m² 567 cd/m². 98 % Center on Battery: 566. cd/m²) ΔE Color 4.6 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 6.5 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.14.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 2358 Hz 25. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 2358.

This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The Xperia XZ1 Compact lets the user choose how the display content should be rendered. There are three modes to choose from: "Standard Mode", "Professional Mode" (uses the sRGB color space), and "Super Vivid Mode" (more vivid color representation).. The color temperature is too high in all three modes, though the blue cast is most pronounced in "Professional Mode". As its name suggests, "Super Vivid Mode" generates the most intense colors â though at a cost, as the color accuracy suffers the most in this mode (Delta E > 8.5). The smartphone achieves the most balanced color representation in standard mode. Here, the colors (Delta E 4.6) and grayscale (Delta E 6.5) most nearly approach the ideal range (Delta E < 3), where the original colors and the display colors look the same..

Thanks to its IPS panel, the Sony smartphone has very stable viewing angles. Even when the screen is viewed from very flat angles, neither the colors nor the brightness lose their intensity.. Outdoors, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact's high brightness and strong contrast are great advantages. Viewing the screen content only becomes difficult when the sun directly hits the highly reflective display surface (a problem that plagues nearly every smartphone).. Though outside appearances may deceive, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is bristling with state-of-the-art hardware. The heart of the little machine is its. Snapdragon 835 , Qualcomm's fastest SoC to date. Sony combines this chip with a high-end. GPU, 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of UFS flash memory.. With these hardware components, the Xperia XZ1 Compact is clearly fit to compete with heavyweights such as the. (the latter of which runs on the same SoC). are not too far ahead of our test device, at least when it comes to performance.. In the synthetic benchmarks, the race between the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact and its competitors is tight. One exception is our test device's high frame rate in the GFXBench 4.0 OnScreen test, although the reason for this is clear: The smartphone ran this test at a lower resolution than normal (1184x720 pixels instead of Full HD), making the task easier on the hardware. In everyday use, the otherwise minor differences in performance between the various Android smartphones hardly matter. At such high levels of performance, small variations will not be noticeable. proves that it is possible to go even faster.. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact.

The Sony smartphone did not so much as break a sweat while running our test games, even though both â Asphalt 8: Airborne â and â Dead Trigger 2 â certainly demand something of the hardware. Even at maximum quality settings, â Dead Trigger 2 â ran at the highest possible frame rate (60 FPS). The same goes for â Asphalt 8: Airborne â, which the game itself limits to a frame rate of 30 FPS. The position and acceleration sensors function flawlessly, and the stereo speakers generate sound from both sides of the device when it is held in landscape format.

In everyday use, the temperatures should remain a good bit lower still, given that we measured this maximum temperature after the smartphone had spent an hour in our stress test. In idle mode, the temperatures sink below 30Â°C (86Â°F) on both the front and back of the device.. Now the question is: Does the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact manage to maintain its moderate surface temperatures by throttling under high levels of load? To find out, we used the GFXBench Manhattan 3.1 test, which renders the same scene 30 times in a row. After around the twelfth run-through, the performance level fell slightly and remained lower until the end of the test. However, the performance difference is too small for the word âthrottlingâ to apply â the change is not perceptible in use.. 37.2 °C 37.4 °C 39.7 °C. 36.8 °C 37.6 °C 39.5 °C. 31.5 °C 36.3 °C 38.4 °C.

When it comes to sound, Sony has obviously made a real effort. The manufacturer has equipped the Xperia XZ1 Compact with stereo speakers hidden in the case. Their sound is not muffled when the device is placed on a table. Even in the standard settings, the Sony smartphone's speakers produce a good, almost room-filling sound.. Overall, even without any extra settings activated (see following paragraph), the sound is very clean. Other smartphones could definitely take a leaf out of the Xperia XZ1 Compact's book, even if the device is no mobile concert hall. As is typical of smartphones, high tones dominate here, while bass tones are almost non-existent.. The sound quality can be optimized using a variety of functions. One is called ClearAudio+, which is intended to create a vibrant listening experience at the push of a button. In our tests, we could not tell the difference between the sound generated by the speakers in standard mode versus when the function was turned on.. When you plug headphones into the smartphone, there are even more settings at your disposal: DSEE HX, which supposedly improves the quality of compressed music files; a surround sound function with concert hall, club and studio profiles; and a sound minimizer, which according to the manufacturer reduces background noise by up to 98%. Unlike the speakers, the sound streaming from headphones is very clearly influenced by these settings. The Xperia XZ1 Compact can also transmit high-fidelity sound via Bluetooth using aptX.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 35.2 40.4 25 32.9 38.8 31 37.2 38.2 40 31.7 36.2 50 39.6 35.4 63 28.3 32.9 80 27.3 31.4 100 26.9 27.3 125 26.7 28.2 160 24 29 200 20.9 33.9 250 20.9 42 315 19.5 51.4 400 18.5 55.8 500 17.5 64.4 630 17.5 63.9 800 15.7 71.7 1000 15.8 73.9 1250 16.6 69.1 1600 15.8 68.1 2000 15.4 72.3 2500 15.5 74.4 3150 16 68.1 4000 15.8 59.2 5000 16 62 6300 16.3 65.5 8000 16.3 72.8 10000 16.2 70.3 12500 16.4 63.9 16000 16.4 52.6 SPL 28.6 81.9 N 1.1 50.2 median 16.4 Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact median 63.9 Delta 2.1 11.1 31.6 39.1 25.4 37.6 25.3 36.9 32.9 40.8 33.6 35.2 31.6 33.3 28.4 33.8 27 33.5 20.8 42.8 22 50.8 21.3 51.5 20.8 49.8 21.2 53.9 19.4 56 19.5 58.7 17.7 61.6 17.9 62.9 17.8 66.2 17.3 68.2 17.4 68.4 16.7 68.5 17.2 67.3 18.2 68 17.9 69.8 17.6 68.8 17.7 67.5 17.8 61.7 17.9 59.1 18.1 60.6 18.2 56.2 30 78.4 1.3 43.6 median 17.9 Apple iPhone 8 median 61.6 1.3 7.5 31.6 35.1 25.4 33.5 25.3 34.8 32.9 34 33.6 29.4 31.6 29.6 28.4 24.9 27 31.2 20.8 34.7 22 39.8 21.3 48.3 20.8 55.3 21.2 59.5 19.4 62.2 19.5 67.1 17.7 70 17.9 73.6 17.8 74.2 17.3 73.2 17.4 72.7 16.7 73.2 17.2 72.1 18.2 69.7 17.9 69 17.6 66.3 17.7 66.9 17.8 67 17.9 51.6 18.1 45.2 18.2 47.7 30 82.4 1.3 54.8 median 17.9 Samsung Galaxy S8 median 66.9 1.3 11.8 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

In Review: Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact is a high-end smartphone with a 4.6-inch display, and such a small form factor has scarcity value. If you are looking for a powerful smartphone that can be easily operated with one hand, this is definitely a device for you. But the Xperia XZ1 Compact, which carries an official price tag of 599 Euros (~$700, US version $599), has more going for it than just its small size and strong performance.. One of the obvious attractions is the Android 8.0 operating system â as of the time of our review, this is one of the very few smartphones running the new OS. And the list of pros goes on: a lightning fast WLAN module, good cameras, good speakers, the bright and evenly lit HD display, and a satisfyingly long battery life. Under the hood, the high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC ensures that everything runs smooth as butter.. Small form factor, high-end hardware, and Android 8.0 â right now these three unite only in the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact.. There is nothing serious to criticize about the Xperia XZ1 Compact. The fact that the battery cannot be replaced is certainly bearable. However, the case may be a sticking point for some people. With its hard edges and sharp corners, as well as comparatively large empty spaces above and below the display, the design will not please everyone..

Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact: Is bigger necessarily better?. Sony has finally taken the wraps off its big phone releases for the year — the Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact phones. The new phones are Sony’s flagship devices,. they boast the latest and greatest Qualcomm chip, the Snapdragon 835 , as well as a decent amount of RAM and storage.. But how do the phones compare with each other? And which one should you go for? We put them to the test to find out.. 148 x 73.4 x 7.4 mm (5.83 x 2.89 x 0.29 inches). 129 x 64 x 9.3 mm (5.08 x 2.52 x 0.37 inches). 4K at 30fps, 1,080p at 60fps, 720p at 960fps. 4K at 30fps, 1,080p at 60fps, 720p at 960fps. Black, Warm Silver, Venus Pink, Moonlit Blue. Black, Snow Silver, Horizon Blue, Twilight Pink. The specs of the two phones are actually almost identical — which is good news for. a powerful phone in a smaller package. They both feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor, and they both feature 4GB of RAM, which should be plenty for most users.. When it comes to the storage on the phones, the Xperia XZ1 offers twice as much as the XZ1 Compact , coming in at 64GB compared to the Compact’s 32GB. Because of that, we’ve awarded this one to the Xperia XZ1.. The display on these two phones will be one of the main points of difference. has a 1,280 x 720-pixel, 4.6-inch display, the standard Xperia XZ1 has a full HD, 1,920 x 1,080-pixel 5.2-inch display. Both of the displays are LCD , but while the XZ1’s display is larger, the resolution bump is enough to make it much sharper as well.. The design of the two phones is more or less the same, apart from the size. for the design of its phones, but these new ones. One interesting thing to note about the XZ1 Compact is that it’s quite a bit thicker than the standard XZ1, which might be a problem for some. Both phones feature a camera sensor on the top-left of the back of the phone. The design is relatively angular and minimalist, with big bezels framing the screen. There is a fingerprint sensor on the side of both devices, but sadly it won’t be functional in the U.S. Last but not least is durability, and the phones are the same here, too — both offer an IP68 rating , which allows them to last as long as 30 minutes in up to 1.5 meters of water. In other words, while you probably won’t want to take the phone swimming, if you drop it in the bath, it should be fine.. Both phones are almost the same here — but the better display on the Xperia XZ1 puts it ahead.. With one larger device and one smaller one, you might expect a pretty substantial difference in battery capacity — but in reality, it turns out that the batteries are exactly the same size. That’s not great news for the standard-sized Xperia XZ1 — not only does it have a larger display, but it also has more pixel-dense display, meaning it’ll be much more battery-intensive.. come in at 2,700mAh, which isn’t a ton, but they also both support Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 , which should be helpful.. We don’t have official battery life figures from Sony, but given the fact that the XZ1 Compact will almost certainly last longer because of the smaller display, it’s the winner here.. Sony camera sensors can be found in smartphones all over the world — and not just in Sony phones. But does that translate into a great camera on the XZ1? We’ll need some time with it to find out.. The rear-facing camera on the phones is the same. It’s 19 megapixels with electronic image stabilization and predictive phase detection autofocus. Video, however, is where this camera really shines. It offers 4K recording at 30 frames per second, 1,080p recording at up to 60 frames per second, and 720p recording at up to a massive 960 frames per second. With that, you’ll be able to capture super slow-motion recordings, which will be great in certain situations.. The front-facing camera here is a little different — the standard XZ1 offers a 13-megapixel front-facing camera, while the XZ1 Compact is at 8-megapixels. That makes the XZ1 the winner here.. The two phones are going to offer an identical software experience, so we’re not going to award a winner here. They both run Android, and they happen to be among the first to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo — which is good news for those who want the latest and greatest versions of Android. Currently, the Android experience on Sony phones seems to be pretty close to stock Android, which is good news for those who hate bloatware.. When it comes to software updates, Sony is generally decent at updating within a few months, but it’ll still take some time for your phone to get new versions of Android as they come out.. costs $600, and will be available online and in stores starting October 4. The standard Xperia XZ1 went on sale September 19, with prices starting at $700.. Because of the price difference, this one is going to the Xperia XZ1 Compact.. This one was probably obvious from the get-go — the Sony Xperia XZ1 is simply a better phone. It has a better screen, more storage, and a superior selfie camera. of getting it may not really matter to you if you’re specifically seeking a smaller phone.. — and though the larger XZ1 offers more storage, they do both have a MicroSD card slot .. The Xperia XZ1 Compact is a better deal financially, and it’s also one of the few small phones on the market with a decent set of specs. The XZ1 offers most of the features that a flagship phone should (unless you’re in the U.S.), and it’s the first phone to ship with the latest flavor of Android on board..

Sony Xperia XZ1 and XZ1 Compact announced with Oreo on board. by Nirave Gondhia August 31, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. A new use for mobile photography. A sweet surprise, out of the box. If you’re interested in all the tiny hardware details, our Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact specs rundown is exactly what you need. Lanh got to play with the new Xperias and he brings you his impressions in our hands-on post. What’s the context? Launching at IFA 2017 today is the new LG V30. Check out the hands-on , and have a look at our complete IFA coverage .. Sony hasn’t had the best of runs over the past few years, but after a lot of restructuring, the company is rebuilding from the bottom up. Since the switch to Xperia X branding, Sony has arguably released as many phones as it ever did, but with the launch of the Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact at IFA today, the company is hoping its new camera can help rekindle consumer interest.. Just as Samsung remains the only company to step away from the norm and consistently launch stylus-enabled Galaxy Note devices, Sony is also stepping away from the norm with its Compact range. The majority of the smartphone industry plays it safe with devices with screens measuring between 5.2 and 5.7 inches, but Sony’s Compact range focuses on offering a flagship experience in a smaller package.. Like previous years, the Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact share a lot of the same features, with a few subtle differences. The biggest feature on both devices is Sony’s new Motion Eye camera, which aims to show off the company’s prowess in imaging. A well-known fact is that Sony provides the imaging sensors for most Android smartphones launched on the market, but the company’s own smartphones don’t traditionally make the best use of these sensors.. On both of these devices, the Motion Eye camera pairs a 19MP camera with a 1/2.3” Exmor-RS for mobile sensor, a 25mm wide G lens with F/2.0 aperture and 1.22µm pixel size for all-round shooting. There’s also Sony’s triple image-sensing technology, predictive hybrid auto-focus and the stand out feature from the Xperia XZ Premium: 960fps Super slow-motion video. Steady-shot 5-axis stabilisation promises stable photo and video recording, and you can shoot up to 4K video on both devices.. The reason you might be interested in the Motion Eye camera isn’t the hardware specs. Instead, it’s what Sony is letting you do with them. The Motion Eye app allows you to scan your face or your full head and it then renders both of these in 3D. From here, there are several uses including creating custom wallpapers, an AR effect (where you can put multiple of you in one picture), gaming and 3D Printing.. For gamers, Sony says you can scan yourself and then share it to your PlayStation account in order to create a life-like avatar quickly and effortlessly. For those more interested in the physical world, Sony is teaming up with 3D Printing partners to let you scan your head or face, and then print a physical copy.. For its latest devices, Sony’s Predictive Capture mode attempts to capture unexpected motion such as your child’s smile, which every parent knows can be a nightmare to capture. The addition of Burst Focus means that even when taking burst shots while moving, they should come out clear and in focus. In a quick comparison, Sony says its camera always remains in focus using Burst Focus while the iPhone 7 Burst mode results in several pictures that are out of focus.. Camera aside, what else do these devices offer and should you buy them? The Xperia XZ1 is the flagship of the two, but the Xperia XZ1 Compact is arguably the more impressive.. The Xperia XZ1 brings a 5.2-inch Full HDR display that Sony claims offers up to 700 nits brightness, and is HDR rated. Sony says it will support streaming HDR content directly from YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, so there should be plenty of content to make use of the HDR display. The 13MP front camera is a 1/3.06” Exmor RS sensor with 22mm focal length that offers a 90° field of view and should be great for group selfies.. There’s also 64GB of storage, the choice of single SIM or dual SIM depending on your market, LTE Cat 16 with Gigabit LTE and 4×4 MIMO, and Bluetooth 5.0. It measures in at a very respectable 7.4mm thin, weighs 155 grams and has a 2,700 mAh battery that Sony says should last over a day thanks to its Stamina mode. It’ll be available in Black, Warm Silver, Moonlight Blue and Venus Pink.. As with previous years, both of these devices share some similar specs which include the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, DLNA, Bluetooth 5.0, IP68 water and dust resistance, expandable storage and Gorilla Glass 5 protection. In global markets, both devices come with a fingerprint sensor embedded into the power button, but just like the Xperia XZ Premium and past Sony devices, this feature is missing again from the US model.. On the design front, both look very similar but the Xperia XZ1 uses a loop surface and seamless metal body design, while the Xperia XZ1 Compact combines a metal panel with a glass woven, plastic body for a robust, but boxier design.. Audio is a key feature for both devices, and the list of audio features is pretty large. Both come with front-facing S Force Surround sound speakers, that Sony claims offers 50% more sound pressure thanks to the new smart amp. Both device support High Resolution Audio and come with support for DSEE HX, LDAC and AptX-HD as well.. While the Xperia XZ1 is arguably the better flagship, the Xperia XZ1 Compact might be the one that stands out more, thanks to its distinctive, diminutive size. In true Compact fashion, it comes with a lot of the same features as the Xperia XZ1 but has a 4.6-inch 720p display that offers up to 600 nits brightness.. The front camera is designed for selfies and you can quickly switch between the same 8MP camera as the Xperia XZ1, and a super wide-angle view with 12.5mm focal length and 120° field of view, which is perfect for selfies where you want to capture the background. Its powered by the same Snapdragon 835 package with 4GB of RAM, but comes with 32GB of storage, and doesn’t support Gigabit LTE. The battery is 2,700 mAh with Quick Charge 3.0 and the handset will be available in Black, Snow Silver, Blue or Twilight Pink.. If there’s one thing you can expect to hear more about in the near future, it is Google’s new Android Oreo OS and Sony’s latest devices are the first devices to be announced as running the new software out of the box. Want to know what the new OS brings? Read our full Android Oreo review and check out the key features in the video below:. is scheduled for both the Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact. Sony states that the former will be available globally starting September 19, so pretty much right out of the gate. Customers will have to wait a little longer for the Xperia XZ1 Compact though, as this model isn’t expected to start hitting store shelves until October 4 2017.. might be a little more forthcoming than previous Xperia releases, which have typically lagged behind the global rollout. Unfortunately we do know that Sony’s latest smartphone will still be missing fingerprint scanners when they make their way to US markets. This is especially disappointing given that fingerprint scanners have become a very commonly used security feature.. Pricing are a little more dear than before.. The Xperia XZ1 is the more expensive of the two, price at $699.99, while the XZ1 Compact is going to cost $599.99. Regional prices may vary a little, but things are looking a little more expensive than when the Xperia Z5 equivalents made their debut. For comparison, the Z5 Compact release launched for around. £450/ €699 / $500, while the regular Z5 was priced around £550 / €550/ $600 for the larger model.. That’s the Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact and at least on paper, both devices certainly have a lot to offer. The Motion Eye 3D camera sounds fantastic (and works really well based on our quick demo) and the internals are all on par with other flagships (fingerprint sensor aside that is).. These are the first new devices to run Android Oreo, but it’s more than likely that we won’t see these go on sale until after Google announces, and releases, its new Pixel 2 and Pixel XL2 devices in October. Sony hasn’t moved away from its boxy design, so these devices are definitely a throwback to a previous generation of 16:9 aspect ratio displays, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing..

Super specs but wasted technology. By Jithu Godwin | 1 Oct 2017. The size is too small @ least 4.7" the, the bezel is too big. Even vivo gionee etc started to have beautiful slimmer profile. So during night we should carry a tripod to get nice photos or we get blurred images for 39000Rs. If the product was launched with a price of 27000 Rs then it would have been ok but this is super overpricing and waste of technology. Vert very pathetic move from a brand like sony.

I know the phone is just barely released, but did anyone get a case for their phone yet? I'm looking for one that's akin to the otterbox commuter cases. They have rubber corners wrapped by a hard shell. The front is slightly raised, so the phone's screen never touches the ground with the screen down. The official SCSG60 case looks super sleek but it looks like it blocks view of the notification led, so you'll never know if you have something waiting for you when the flap's closed. Whose decision was that? On the back, they made a hole for the camera and led flash but I don't you can't even use the camera with the flap closed, so what's the point?. I guess another thing to keep in mind with cases is whether the fingerprint sensor should be accessible for easy unlocking. Most cases will cover up all four sides of the phone..

I wrote to Ringke to ask for information because their quality it's amazing. A to couple of week ago, they replied to have plans to release a case for XZ1 or XZ1 compact. Maybe if many of us request it, we will have a production line. Unfortunately we do not have any plans for Xperia XZ1, however I will forward this to our development team.

Nice enough case and fits well (as you'd expect being 'Made for Xperia') its my first ever flappy fold case so still not sure of that but otherewise happy enough.

Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact review: A mini handset with flagship features. facebook twitter google+ email Comments. Sony’s Xperia XZ1 Compact squeezes top-end features into a 4.6in smartphone, at a flagship-besting price. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact review: What you need to know Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact review: Price and competition Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact review: Design Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact review: Display Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact review: Performance and battery life Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact review: Camera Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact review: Verdict. Sony’s Xperia XZ1 Compact tries to prove that a 4.6in smartphone has some relevance in 2017. With displays getting bigger, phones getting larger and trouser pockets bulging, small-screened phones are likely to be a relic of the past.. But, Sony’s Xperia XZ1 Compact not only serves to show that pocket-friendly phones still exist, but it does everything so spectacularly well that it forces you to wonder where our obsession with big-screened phones started in the first place. Need more convincing? Here’s why the Xperia XZ1 Compact is a standout smartphone in 2017.. READ NEXT: The best smartphones 2017 has to offer. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact UK SIM-Free Smartphone - Black. As the name suggests, Sony’s Xperia XZ1 Compact is the smaller version of its Xperia XZ1 handset. It has a teeny tiny 4.6in 1,280 x 720 display, slips into any pocket with ease and, best of all, it’s considerably cheaper than its larger cousin.. It doesn’t scrimp on the specifications, though, including Qualcomm’s latest and greatest Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, which is expandable via microSD card by up to 256GB.. There’s also a 19-megapixel camera on the back, which supports Sony’s new 3D scanning tech (it’s not good, but more on that later), and the Compact runs Android 8 Oreo with Sony’s launcher software plastered on top.. Sony’s XZ1 Compact is £500; that’s £100 less than the regular-sized XZ1. At that price, the XZ1 Compact just about dodges flagship territory, instead coming up against 2017’s mid-rangers such as the OnePlus 5 (£450) and Nokia 8 ( £499 ). Samsung’s superb Galaxy S8 can be scooped up for around £530 nowadays so that’s worth considering in the same price bracket, too.. The Xperia XZ1 Compact cuts a familiar figure. In fact, besides its smaller footprint and silky soft plastic matte finish, it looks near identical to the larger Xperia XZ1.. The Compact adopts identical chamfered edges at the top and bottom of the phone, complete with softly rounded sides and sharp-edged corners, which are primed to play havoc with your pockets.. It’s IP68 dust- and water-resistant, just like the rest of Sony’s recent lineup. There’s a fingerprint reader doing double duties with the side-mounted power button, and there’s a dedicated shutter button for the camera situated on the right-hand edge.. On the top edge sits a solitary 3.5mm headphone jack and on the bottom you’ll find a USB Type-C port with Quick Charge 3 support.. The 4.6in 720p display feels old hat in 2017, especially on a £500 smartphone. And in a year where the big manufacturers are all pushing the bezel-less approach the XZ1 Compact’s frontage looks decidedly frumpy at first. Aside from the sub-Full HD resolution, the XZ1 Compact’s display is superb. Colour accuracy is terrific, especially with the phone’s “professional” display mode engaged. It covers 89% of the sRGB colour gamut, the contrast ratio reaches an impressive 1,280:1 while brightness peaks at a glaring 611cd/m2. This is one fabulous smartphone display and it won’t leave you squinting at your Facebook feed in direct sunlight.. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact UK SIM-Free Smartphone - Black. The Xperia XZ1 Compact is powered by the same octa-core 2.35GHz Snapdragon 835 chip as the Galaxy S8, OnePlus 5 and XZ Premium all are. Pair that with 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage and Android 8 Oreo from the get-go and it’s clear Sony hasn’t scrimped on its innards.. The Compact is one speedy handset, performing exceptionally well in the benchmarks, with the XZ1 Compact returning near identical multi-core and single-core CPU scores to 2017’s other Snapdragon 835-equipped handsets. Indeed, thanks to its lower resolution display, it delivers superior graphics test results as well.. Battery life is much improved over the regular XZ1, too, with the Compact reaching 16hrs 29mins in our continuous video playback test, as opposed to the XZ1’s 12-hour longevity.. The XZ1 Compact’s 19-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera is identical to the regular XZ1’s and benefits from Electronic Image Stabilisation (EIS) for seriously stable video. The excellent “predictive” phase-detect and laser autofocus also makes another appearance, for speedy hassle-free shooting in all sorts of lighting conditions.. Given the higher pixel count, pictures looked much crisper than those taken with the OnePlus 5, capturing plenty of detail in intricate brickwork and foliage. There was a tendency to over-sharpen the image which leads to the loss of some of the finer details, while low-light performance was decent, if a touch on the noisy side.. How about that 3D scanning tech, then? It’s simple to use: just map a face, head, food or any other object with the rear camera by following the dotted lines that appear onscreen. You can then re-scan to fill in more intricate details with the camera, and tap to confirm when you’re ready to begin rendering.. The problem is, despite its simplicity, the results are horribly inconsistent. Face and head scanning can be nice and detailed on occasion but too often you’re left with a Frankenstein’s Monster of a face, or a horribly mangled burn victim.. Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact UK SIM-Free Smartphone - Black. Still, it’s impressive that all the fancy post-processing is rendered on the handset itself, without sending it over to a distant server somewhere. And, there’s the likelihood of future integration with Sony’s PlayStation division in the future, which could transform this otherwise gimmicky feature into a more compelling one.. Sony’s XZ1 Compact is a mid-range marvel; don’t let its dinky size fool you. Performance is on par with the best smartphones in the industry, it has a camera that’s ideal for photographers on a budget, and a fantastic-looking display.. The Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact faces stiff competition, sure, coming up against such smartphones as the excellent OnePlus 5 and Nokia 8, but its unique approach (at least among Android smartphones) is sure to win it fans industry-wide. If you prefer your phones to be usable one-handed you won’t be disappointed.. Hardware Processor Octa-core 2.45GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 RAM 4GB Screen size 4.6in Screen resolution 1,280 x 720 Screen type IPS Front camera 8-megapixel Rear camera 19-megapixel Flash LED GPS Yes Compass Yes Storage (free) 32GB Memory card slot (supplied) microSD Wi-Fi 802.11ac Bluetooth 5.0 NFC Yes Wireless data 4G Dimensions 129 x 64 x 9.3 mm Weight 140g Features Operating system Android 8.0 Battery size 2,700mAh.

Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact – Battery life. Why should I buy the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact?. Like both the Xperia XZ Premium and Xpera XZ1, the Compact model has a 19-megapixel rear sensor with f/2.0 aperture lens. It similarly uses a ‘memory stacked’ sensor, which means it swaps a limited amount of dedicated RAM for some extra camera trickery as well as improving general camera performance – in theory, at least. The XZ1 Compact lacks the dual-camera array seen in many phones nowadays; and as such, there’s no added telephoto reach or faux-bokeh portrait modes.. For still image performance, autofocus performed well for the most part, obtaining a lock relatively quickly in good lighting. There’s predictive image capture, which begins buffering images shortly before you actually press the shutter button, and a smile-detecting capture mode too. These features make capturing fleeting moments a little easier.. Still image quality is a bit of a mixed bag. The XZ1 Compact favours contrast and saturation over anything bordering on authentic. It makes for some rather dramatic-looking images, but they can be far removed from reality.. If you’re a fan of applying filters to your shots then this probably won’t bother you. Admittedly mundane, I took a picture of some toast in one instance and the XZ1 Compact boosted the contrast and saturation, which improved the shot in some areas. But when my eyes went from looking at the phone display to the actual scene in front me, I realised the contrast has been boosted so much that the shadow detail on the table had been completely underexposed. The wood grain of the table was missing entirely.. What the scene looked like in reality.. Some won’t mind this heavy software touch. Personally, I’d rather have a more authentic representation of the scene. After all, you can always fiddle with the image afterwards, but no amount of tweaking is going to bring back that lost detail.. There are times when the software image tweaking can have a nice effect, though. Sunset images in particular look far more dramatic thanks to that added warmth and colour vibrancy.. The camera does well in terms of sharpness, provided there’s enough light. In low light that f/2.0 aperture lens and high megapixel sensor begin to struggle. It’s at this point shutter speeds need to slow right down, so any scene with movement is likely to end up with motion blur. There’s also a little more noise in the shadow detail than I’d like.. The rear camera is generally a decent performer for still images, but it’s a distance off some of the big flagships overall.. The front-facing camera has an 8-megapixel sensor. Usefully, it lets you toggle between a wider and narrower field of view. The wide option offers a 120-degree FOV, which is great for getting a group of people into the frame but you do get some barrel distortion as a result. With decent light, the front-facing camera does a decent job of selfies.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

It suffers the same limitations I experienced with the Xperia XZ Premium, though. Namely, you need optimal lighting conditions. Under good conditions you can get genuinely cool videos, but you really need to be prepared to capture the scene as the timing is difficult to nail down.. A 3D scanning function uses the rear camera to let you scan faces or objects and then manipulate them. It’s a fun momentary distraction – but like the 960fps video, is likely to be a feature you’ll soon forget about.. Battery stamina is one of the XZ1 Compact’s strongest points. It has the same 2700mAh battery as the bigger XZ1 – but a much smaller, lower-resolution display to power. This, combined with the efficient Snapdragon 835, delivers. On a heavy-use day, comprising sending and receiving numerous WhatsApp messages, non-stop social media monitoring and copious music streaming, I retired at 11pm with 30% of the battery remaining. This was having taken the phone off charge around 8am.. Half an hour of Netflix streaming at half brightness only knocks the battery down by about 7%. While you’re not looking at two days of juice off a single charge, I never once felt the need to carry around a portable charger. Nowadays, that’s all I want from a phone – and honestly, it’s a huge weight off my mind.. If you’re the kind of person who wants a small phone then these days your options are rather limited. Thankfully, then, the Xperia XZ1 Compact is a decent option. While you might be sacrificing screen size, this isn’t at the expense of performance. In addition, you benefit from stellar battery life too.. Where the XZ1 Compact is docked points is for its actual design: it feels dated. The camera performance is also a little underwhelming considering its price.. Ultimately, though, the only reason to consider the XZ1 Compact over other similarly priced phones such as the OnePlus 5 or now reduced in price LG G6 is its size.. For me, however, moving to a smaller handset was the most difficult part of the review experience.. A pocket powerhouse with plenty of battery life – but that design is looking rather dated..

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Lenovo's Yoga 730 is a cheaper 2-in-1 with Alexa support. The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. Sony will sell its wireless 'open-ear' buds in the US. Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. I really wanted to like Sony's Xperia XZ1 Compact. Purely because the company is among the last to make small phones.. No one really makes decent small phones anymore. Apple hasn't updated the iPhone SE in almost two years, and the "mini" flagship phase fizzled out long before that. Tracking down a sub-5-inch Android phone you'd actually consider buying could be the plot of the next Indiana Jones movie. I guess it'd be a short flick, though, because you only have to look as far as Sony and its "Compact" smartphones, which the company keeps making despite the wider industry's having moved on. Perhaps I'm a champion of choice or just feel nostalgia for a time when phones were smaller and life was simpler, but I wanted to like the Xperia XZ1 Compact , released last fall. Gallery: Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact | 14 Photos. I mean, what's not to like about a cute little phone with an octa-core Snapdragon 835 roaring away inside? OK, so maybe 720p is a resolution you frown at these days, even if the thing does only have a 4.6-inch LCD display. But otherwise, 4GB of RAM, 32 gigs of expandable storage, Gorilla Glass 5, Android 8.0 Oreo, IP65/68 waterproof rating -- these are all things you're quite happy to see on a spec sheet. The 2,700mAh battery keeps the thing powered up for significantly longer than the typical daily cycle, too, though you would kind of expect that, given that it's powering so few pixels.. Sony also equipped the XZ1 Compact with some of the best imaging tech it has to offer. There's an 8-megapixel front-facing camera with wide-angle lens for the selfie generation, but more important is the 19MP "Motion Eye" camera round back. It boasts phase detection and laser autofocus, not to mention super-slow-mo video recording at 960 fps , just one of Sony's exhausting list of camera features and tools, such as 3D scanning. The shutter speed isn't always able to keep up with the energetic thrashing of the guy from Crazy Town in a dingy pub, but low-light performance, in general, is solid.. In better lighting conditions, the thing shoots detailed, well-saturated pictures -- something that doesn't come as a shock, considering the hardware at play. But wow , does the XZ1 Compact rub me the wrong way on a daily basis. The fingerprint sensor that doubles as a power button can be temperamental, probably because it's so small. This won't be a problem on US models, of course, since they don't possess fingerprint readers. Sony only recently committed to adding these to all future Xperias launched stateside.. Any minor jolt in the headphone jack area pauses music as if you've decoupled your cans entirely, which couldn't be more frustrating. Max headphone volume leaves plenty to be desired too, and getting a Bluetooth speaker connected is a draining exercise in trial and error.. When I use Google Maps, the compass is often drunk, pointing in roughly the right direction but dancing left and right at random. WiFi range is pretty poor on the whole, and there's a bunch of bloatware preinstalled on the device that I can do without. This includes Amazon's app suite, AVG, Kobo and a plethora of Xperia tools that ping you every five minutes about the highlight video it's created for you, etc.. The phone isn't at all lacking performance-wise, thanks to the Snapdragon 835 at its heart, but the user experience has plenty of gremlins. Apps randomly crash without warning, and that's if the whole phone hasn't just frozen up entirely. General stability has improved vastly over the course of a few software updates, though.. The same is true of the auto-brightness setting, which used to behave like a club strobe light. I had to turn it off almost immediately when I first received the device, meaning frequent manual brightness adjustments became the norm. Updates appear to have addressed this, though only for the most part. And it's permanently overcast in the UK currently, so I haven't had the chance to revet it in direct sunlight.. A high price tag doesn't make the phone any easier a sell, either. The XZ1 Compact launched at $600, though it's now available for $500 on Amazon. In the UK, it was originally £499, but you can find it online for around £315 these days. Not that I could recommend it, even at that price. Did I mention that the phone is built mostly from plastic? A glass-fiber-reinforced plastic, available in a few unique colors, but plastic all the same. Even budget phones at a fraction of the price have moved on to metal. The XZ1 Compact, under my (loving) care, has picked up a few scrapes, and yet I haven't used it as my primary device for more than a month in total.. None of what I've said so far has anything to do with the size, you might have noticed. Well, it's small -- too small... Even with SwiftKey at my side, rarely can I construct a sentence without a comedy of errors. It just feels cramped and frustrating; my thumbs keep hitting the wrong keys and icons. Perhaps, like the industry, I have moved on to bigger screens that demand a less delicate touch. Or maybe I'm a hypocrite? My iPhone 8 (cue comment wars) has a 4.7-inch display, only a fraction bigger than the one on the XZ1 Compact, and I can use that with surgical precision.. It could be that the screen isn't the issue, then, but the design. Not only does it feel cramped, but it's uncomfortable. The Xperia is quite chunky, at 9.3mm (0.37 inch) thick, and the bottom edge is rather sharp. It digs into your palm and scratches away at the place where a neat, rounded corner should sit. Like a hedgehog, it's cute but prickly. You can even feel how angular it is when you sit down, phone in jeans pocket.. Still, none of this can be directly attributed to why the small phone is a dying breed. I imagine that the big manufacturers have market research, focus groups and all the rest that say there isn't much opportunity in sub-5-inch phones anymore. And Sony probably has number crunchers of its own concluding that there's still enough demand that one company can capitalize on that niche.. There's no sign of any other bijou devices in the works over at Sony at the moment, though the XZ1 Compact isn't even close to being a year old yet. The two new mid-range Xperias announced at CES earlier this month have more standard 5.2- and 5.5-inch displays. And at this point, the only rumors floating around Sony for the mobile-focused MWC show in February are the talk of "Premium" and "Pro" handsets with big screens. The XZ1 Compact was first announced at the end of last August, though, so maybe Sony will continue its flirtation with smaller smartphones when the time is right. And I'll really want to like that one, too.. gear , hands-on , mobile , smartphone , sony , sonyxperiaxz1compact , xperiaxz1compact , xz1compact.
