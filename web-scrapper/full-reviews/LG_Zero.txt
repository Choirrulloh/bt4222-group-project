For psystems: LG is not going to provide an Nougat update but there is custom rom Nougat for this phone.. How this phone compares to the Samsung J5?. Can you tell me the way???. The phone is great, but I started having some problems after two weeks: I cannot connect it to my PC for backup, with USB cable, since it won't recognize the data. It heats up if I use it over 20 minutes and the battery goes down really fast. I guess it has something to do with the fact I haven't put on an external memory card and all my pictures and videos (I take a lot) are stored in the internal memory. I think I'll try to backup up some other way and then restore it to start over. Other than that, the phone is amazing. Great camera, easy to use, fast and elegant.. Pages: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ».

Yo tuve ese celular la dvd esta bueno pero a la hora de jugar algún juego con graficos medios alv todo se tilda gg ni el mobile legendes puedo jugar agarrame la chota #enter La batería tendría que ser más de 3000 mAh por lo menos por que su pantalla no aguantaría mucho. Me ofrecen un cambio de un LG Zero Color Dorado por mi Samsung Galaxy S5.. hola tengo mi lg zero hace 5 meses junto con mi novio y a el la camara frontal se ve super genial blanca en interiores y a mi me ve amarilla. Queria saber si alguien mas se le ve la camara frontal asi y si se puede arreglar. Hola yo tuve uno desde el año pasado hasta hace unos dias jamas le paso nada ni se tildo nunca ni se apago por sorpresa, sinseramente es un telefono brillante.. Tengo este LG Zero hace 7 meses, lo uso mucho y es muy completo, muy buenas imágenes con sus cámaras, muy cómodo y elegante, siempre usé Sony pero ahora prefiero este, su pantalla con bordes curvos lo hacen muy cómodo y su carcasa metálica es muy buena!!. Es excelente lo tengo hace año y medio y no falla. Rapido, camara muy buena, imagenes muy nitidas. De tener un samsung a lg me quedo 1000 veces con esta marca..

Sony presenta dos nuevos flagships con nuevo lenguaje de diseño: los esperados Sony Xperia XZ2 y Xperia XZ2 Compact. Una alternativa más confiable para desbloquear la pantalla del Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+: Intelligent Scan. Dos propuestas de mediana a baja gama de ZTE: Blade V9 y Blade V9 VITA, dos modelos con ligeras diferencias. Podría ocurrir que se repitan en otro lado, pero las cámaras del Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+ son algo único.

more ... more .... more ... more .... Metal-made LG Class launched in Europe as the LG Zero. Metal-made LG Class launched in Europe as the LG Zero. posted by Florin T.. Tags :. AT&T - AT&T + LG - LG + Android - Android +. Announced and released in South Korea in September, the LG Class is now also available in Europe, but under a different name: LG Zero. At the moment, the LG Zero can be purchased only in Italy, but we assume that the handset will soon be launched in other markets. Unlike most of LG's smartphones, the Zero / Class is made out of metal (aluminum). However, it's far from being a high-end smartphone, and this is obvious if we look at its 5-inch display with 720 x 1280 pixels, or at its quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor. The new smartphone runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, further featuring LTE connectivity, a 13 MP rear camera, an 8 MP front-facing camera, 16 GB of expandable internal memory, and a 2050 mAh battery. While the LG Class that's sold in Korea has 2 GB of RAM, the LG Zero only comes with 1.5 GB. Customers in Italy can buy the new LG smartphone unlocked for €299 (about $320). AT&T will reportedly release the LG Class in the US , but for now there's no official confirmation about this. Would you buy the new LG handset?. sources: LG Italy , TuttoAndroid.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Pampered Pooch - Alternative use for Cooler Shock. Size: 14 Zipper Seal | Verified Purchase. Our puppy is a Samoyed (double coat fluff ball), build for sled pulling and snow, but not Houston heat. We got her cause the breed is great with kids and allegedly hypoallergenic. She couldn't sleep through the night because she was getting too hot in her crate. I purchased this product as an alternative to doggy chill mats, since the pet cooler mats when you put them in the freezer don't stay cold very long. We had tried several of them, and even hard freezing them we would end up adding blue ice packs to the crate/dog bed by 2:30 AM. I figured, these packs are big enough that I put all three into a pillow case and freeze them, it would be better than those cold mats that stay cool for only a few hours. With the Cooler Shock she makes it from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM. By morning the Cooler Shock is pretty much thawed, but still cool to the touch. Blue Ice would be thawed completely and warm and that is with them being on a pet chill mat. Bottom line, I am able to get sleep through the night. The dog thinks it's the best treat ever, stares at the freezer waiting to be put to bed. I realize that is probably the strangest application every, but thermodynamically they do a great job next to a 101 degree furry heat exchanger.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Get Six of These!. Size: 14 Zipper Seal | Verified Purchase. If you are not familiar with the Deep South, it is one of the hottest, most humid places you can imagine during the summer. My family lives on a small farm, and we are often working outside, using a tailgate as a workbench. In those conditions, staying hydrated is difficult. A steady supply of cold water is a must. Early this summer we began with two bags of ice in a cheap cooler. This process of buying two bags of ice every morning started to get really expensive. I decided to invest in one of the new generation of coolers. Two bags of ice would hold for two days (which is impressive when the cooler is in the back of a truck in the AR sun all day). Still expensive, it was pretty gross because at the end of the day all of your water bottles are floating in some nasty (sweat, dust, etc.) albeit cold water. My quest for a solution to this problem led me to the Cooler Shock product via an Amazon search. I was skeptical because I read reviews that talked about the "bribe" the company offers for good reviews. I decided it was worth the cost to find out if the product worked as claimed. I can tell you that this stuff works! 3 pouches of this stuff in a 50 Quart K2 cooler will keep a case of bottled water cold for up to two days. By the end of the third day, the packs are all melted and the water bottles are just cool (which is still better than 95+ degrees). I was so impressed that I ordered another three pack of Cooler Shocks today. My plan is to use 3 and keep 3 in the deep freeze, rotating them every evening. This gives me an endless supply of cold water in the field with no buying ice and no nasty water in the cooler to clean out every day.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars I don't recommend having beverage cans in direct contact with them as .... Been using these for about a year now and bought them directly from CoolerShock.com. I just purchased another 3 about two weeks ago and they are the same as before. Keep frozen food frozen and drinks will be icy cold to the point you can't hold them in your hand. I don't recommend having beverage cans in direct contact with them as you will get ice in your drink and that is not so good with beer. Bottled beverages seem to not get frozen, but still very cold. I use these in conjunction with my two Pelican coolers. One is a 45qt unit and the other is the newer 20qt unit. The 20qt cooler I keep in the back of my truck 24/7 and travel with it anywhere I go. I'll use the Cooler Shock packs for the first couple of days and then resort to cubed hotel ice if I need to stay longer than 3 days. With the combo of the Pelican coolers and the Cooler Shock ice packs, I can't ask for anything better for week long outings to keep things cold in the cooler. Great product as long as you allow them to freeze for two days prior to using. It is also best to make sure they are laying flat as possible in the freezer so they will fit better in the cooler you are going to put them in. Crinkled up ice packs don't fit well in a cooler when space is at a premium while packing said cooler. Overall, great product and easy to fill and close using a hot iron. Just make sure ALL the air is out before sealing them shut. They fit the Pelican 20qt Cooler very well and the photos show the ice pack after 4 days and sitting atop ice. Makes ice last that much longer.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Get These.... Size: 14 Zipper Seal | Verified Purchase. Product review: this was my second order of these. Cost: Very affordable, especially when comparing to the Yeti and RTIC packs 2. They work: they freeze colder than ordinary ice packs and last longer as well. I have a 60L rotomolded South Jetty Cooler (southjettycoolers.com). Put a number of these in my cooler this past Monday. The packs, while no longer frozen (4 days later), are very very cold. More importantly the beverages in the cooler are still frosty cold. These are mailed without any liquid in them. There is a chemical in the pouches, that when mixed with water turns into a gel. The directions were clear and it was very easy to fill the piouches up with the required amount of water, get the air out, zip shut, dry the fold by the zip top and iron to seal. If someone is not comfortable with filling and sealing these ice packs themselves, I believe you can ordered them filled for an additional cost. Space Saving: Since the exterior is not a hard molded plastic bottle, these are smaller and more flexible. Which makes them fit in the cooler better. The pouches as a very heavy duty Mylar too pouch. They feel as though they're pretty strong. Bottom Line: I would HIGHLY recommend these for your cooler. I have yet to come up with a Con. If I do, I will revise my review accordingly.. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars no better than other ice substitute packs sold for a fraction .... Size: 14 Zipper Seal | Verified Purchase. Mediocre, no better than other ice substitute packs sold for a fraction of the cost. I've included a picture of why it is reviewed so highly.. Was this review helpful to you?.

Korea’s second biggest smartphone manufacturer has been one of the last major players in the market to embrace metal. With the LG Zero, however, it’s going all-in.. The phone was first announced as the LG Class in its native country back in September, but LG today announced a new name and launch details for the global model.. Sales of the LG Zero will start this week in Taiwan followed by “key markets in Asia, Europe and Latin America.”. LG’s new phone features a solid aluminium body, while its 5.0-inch 720p in-cell IPS display curves off slightly at the edges to create the impression of a slimmer profile. LG calls this feature “Arc Glass,” though the curve appears to be more iPhone 6S than Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge .. On the power front, LG rather skates over things with mention of a “1.2GHz Quad-Core Processor,” suggesting that it’s far from a top performer.. We’re glad to read that the LG Zero packs in at least some of the LG G4 ‘s camera technology. Whether that’s simply an attempt to associate the 13-megapixel rear camera and 8-megapixel front-facing example with one of the better smartphone cameras on the market, we’re not sure.. Related: Best cheap mobile phones 2015. As you might have detected from some of the components, the LG Zero is essentially a lower mid-range phone in a premium body. In that respect, it fits in with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy A5 , the HTC One A9 , and the OnePlus X.. As such, while pricing for the LG Zero will be announced locally at the time of availability, we’re expecting it to come in somewhere around the £250 mark..

LG Zero Smartphone With All-Metal Body, 4G LTE Support Launched. Ketan Pratap , 01 December 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. LG back in September launched its new Class mid-range smartphone in Korea priced at SKW 399,300 (approximately Rs. The smartphone was exclusive to Korean market.. The company has now revealed LG Zero , the global variant of the Class, which will be available globally. LG has announced that the LG Zero smartphone will be available in Taiwan starting this week followed by other key markets in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. It will be available in Gold and Silver colours. The company adds that the smartphone will continue to be marketed as the LG Class in Germany, Korea, Russia, and Singapore. Unfortunately, LG has announced that it will announce pricing and availability of the Zero at the time of local launch.. One of the highlights of the LG Zero smartphone, similar to Class smartphone, is its metal body, and like other recent LG handsets, it features power and volume rocker buttons on the rear panel, just below the primary camera. The handset sports LG logo branding both on front and back panels. The Zero sports an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, which the company touts comes with the image sensor from the LG G4 flagship.. For specifications, the LG Zero smartphone featured identical specifications as the Class. It features a 5-inch HD (720x1280 pixels) IPS display. It offers a pixel density of 294ppi. The company notes that the Zero features an "Arc Glass" design at the edges giving it a slimmer profile.. It is powered by a 1.2GHz quad-core processor. Considering that the Class was backed by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 SoC, we can expect Zero smartphone to be powered by the same chipset. One of the biggest differences between the two handsets is in RAM - the Zero packs 1.5GB of RAM while Class came with 2GB of RAM. The handset packs 16GB of built-in storage while supporting expandable storage via microSD card (up to 2TB).. The company has confirmed that the LG Zero runs Android 5.1 Lollipop. There is a 13-megapixel rear camera with LED flash. The smartphone supports FM radio recording feature while also featuring a 1W speaker.. It measures 142x71.8x7.4mm and weighs 147 grams. For connectivity, the LG Zero supports 4G LTE, 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC, and Micro-USB. The smartphone packs a 2050mAh embedded battery.. Announcing the handset, Juno Cho, president and CEO of LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company said, "At LG, we do not believe in limiting our best technology to just our flagship devices. The LG Zero exhibits innovation not only in its design but in its ability to offer premium features at a competitive price point.".

First Posted: Dec 01, 2015 05:24 PM EST. Samsung Galaxy Alpha vs LG Zero. LG just announced the global rollout of its newest smartphone, the LG Zero, in a bid for smartphone consumers in Asia, Europe, and Latin America that are looking for a high-quality build, good hardware specs, and a premium look for a low price. So how will LG's latest mid-premium handset do against the competition?. Here's how the LG Zero stacks up against Samsung's long-running play for the same market, the Samsung Galaxy Alpha, which was released in August of last year.. First and foremost, both the LG Zero and the Samsung Galaxy Alpha offer premium iPhone-like aesthetics and build quality for less than the cost of an iPhone.. The Galaxy Alpha has a metal frame with nicely curved corners. But the back of this device is still plastic, and roughly looks like a modified version of the chicken-skin texture that made the Samsung Galaxy S5 a pariah in the premium smartphone market.. LG ups the ante against Samsung with an all-metal construction and the company is touting the "Arc Glass" design of the edges, which isn't exactly like a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, but comes close, while also complimenting the slim profile of the LG Zero.. However, the LG Zero has a decidedly boxy look, so if you're looking for something with a sleek face, LG doesn't have it on offer here.. The LG Zero has the hardware advantage over the Samsung Galaxy Alpha since it's a just-released 2015 smartphone. It comes with a 5-inch 720p HD display, which yields just under 300 pixels per inch.. The LG Zero runs a 1.2GHz quad-core processor with 1.5GB of RAM, and is LTE capable. Another important feature is the 13MP camera, with LG's acclaimed camera software features, and the LG Zero also throws in an 8MP front-facing shooter. There's also Bluetooth 4.1 LE and a 2050mAh batter, which is not removable and seemingly sized down in favor of the LG Zero's slim design.. The Samsung Galaxy Alpha comes with a 4.7-inch Super AMOLED screen with the same 720p resolution. Instead of the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on the LG Zero, the Alpha sports the forth generation for better protection.. The Galaxy Alpha, despite being a year older, comes with an octa-core Samsung Exynos 5 at 1.8GHz and 1.3GHz on its two quad cores, along with 2GB of RAM. It's LTE capable as well, and comes with a fingerprint scanner and heart rate monitor, which the LG Zero doesn't have.. The Galaxy Alpha's camera is close to the LG Zero's at 12-megapixels, while its secondary shooter is a meager 2.1-megapixels. Also weaker, the Galaxy Alpha has a 1860mAh battery.. When it comes to storing your photos, the LG Zero's 16GB of internal memory may seem weak against the Samsung Galaxy Alpha's standard 32GB, but LG's offering comes with a microSD slot for up to 128GB of additional space.. First of all, the Samsung Galaxy Alpha has one other disadvantage due to its age: It comes with the Android 4.4.4 Lollipop, though it is upgradable to Android 5.0.2, while the LG Zero runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop right out of the box. It's unclear at this time, though, whether either device will be eligible for the Android 6.0 Marshmallow upgrade.. Available in an attractive brushed-metal Silver or Gold, the LG Zero was announced. by LG as a smartphone with "premium features at a competitive price point," but LG hasn't announced prices yet. However, there have been rumors that the LG Zero might carry a price point of between $300 and $400, depending on location.. The Samsung Galaxy Alpha, meanwhile, was released at an incredibly high $600 price point a mid-ranger, but that sticker price has come down dramatically over the year. You can get the Galaxy Alpha from many places online for under $300 now, though your mileage may vary depending on the deals available, and whether you're okay with buying a pre-owned phone or not.. Both phones are intended for global markets, so the Samsung Galaxy Alpha is available in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, and the LG Zero will be soon, as it rolls out. The LG Zero is also available on AT&T in the U.S., as is the Galaxy Alpha.. Tags samsung galaxy alpha , LG Zero , Comparison review , Smartphone review.
