In: Mobiles , News. Key specs of the Lava A51. 8GB (Expandable Up To 32GB Via microSD). Key specs of the Lava A76+. 8GB (Expandable Up To 32GB Via microSD). Indian cell phone company Lava has launched two new phones in India dubbed Lava A51 and Lava A76+. These new phones are an expansion to Lava’s budget-friendly Android smartphones. Talking about Lava A51, the phone comes with a 4.5-inch screen featuring 800 x 480 pixels FWVGA resolution. Powering this phone is a 1.2 GHz Quad-Core processor. However, Lava has not revealed the exact chipset.. The Lava A51 has a highly limited 512MB of RAM, something which is no longer common when it comes to memory offerings. As far as the internal memory is concerned, there is a minimal 8GB internal storage which is expandable up to 32GB. On the camera front, it houses a 5-megapixel rear snapper with LED flash. Thankfully, Lava could offer at least a VGA camera on the front so that selfie lovers will not miss opportunities. Finally, there is a 1700mAh battery inside. This phone lacks 4G support which is surprising considering the ongoing Reliance Jio trend.. On the other hand, the Lava A76+ sports a display which is similar to that of the Lava A51. It also embraces 8GB of internal storage which is expandable up to 32GB. This phone is powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core processor coupled with 1GB of RAM. You will get a 5-megapixel rear snapper and mated with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. This phone packs in an 1850mAh battery. Fortunately, the Lava A76+ supports 4G, unlike the Lava A51.. Both the Lava phones run Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system with a standard Android user interface on top. Other connectivity options include microUSB, Bluetooth, and GPS. The Lava A51 and Lava A76+ are priced at Rs 4,199 and Rs 5,599 respectively. At the time of writing this, there is no information regarding their availability.

Research studies show consumers are no longer hungry after extremely budget smartphones; rather their preferences have changed towards reasonably priced products that meet their personalized requirements.. Highly competitive market, affordable 4G service introduced by Jio, availability of so many choices and again a volatile market eco system have made the entire segment very unpredictable. However, homegrown brands – despite competitors from foreign countries – are making their footprint visible through great products that meet changing Indian audiences’ demands.

If you have held of buying a smartphone till now because of the simple reason that their price did not justify the functionality on offer, perhaps now is the time for a review of the matter. Given the extraordinary rise in use of smartphones the technology behind them has finally saturated and the humdrum around best specs and annual flagship launches has settled down. You can get a fairly powerful android smartphone under 10000 these days.. Today we have a look at a range of best mobiles under 10000 from the Indian phone company – Lava International. The company has had an exceptional start in the country and has become one of the most easily recognised budget smartphones brands in India.. Coming with 5.5 inch of screen real estate, the X9 is not for the faint hearted as it needs a lot of space in your pockets. The IPS LCD Panel on the phone has an HD resolution and is bright enough indoors and outdoors. The phone is powered by a Quad Core 1.3 GHz processor that comes paired with 2 GB of RAM. The X9 handles games and apps smoothly, no qualms there.. Pictures taken with the 13-megapixel camera at the back come out sharp and the colour balance is also quite accurate given the phone’s budget origins. 16 GB of internal storage means you are not constrained for storage memory either. The front facing camera is also a hefty 8-megapixel and captures some nice looking selfies.. The phone comes in a dual SIM setup and offers good connectivity, the 2500mAH battery offers nearly 8 hours of talk time and should be more than enough for general users. All in all the X9 is a well rounded phone with a pretty large screen and on par performance.. One of the most celebrated phones in the Lava Mobiles’ lineup, the X8 takes the prize home for stylish design. The metallic finish back combines with the 2.5D glass panel at the front to give you a premium looking handset. The phone doesn’t lack in horsepower as well. The Quad Core processor coupled with 3GB of RAM holds up games and apps comfortably. The X9 comes with 16 Gigs of internal storage which can be expanded up to 32GB, using a microSD card.

The Android 6.0 Marshmallow software on board this phone makes the deal ever more sweeter for a phone under 10000 INR.. Both these devices offer excellent value for money. If you want a larger display, go for the X9, and in case you are looking for a more rounded off performance device the 5″ X81 is out choice for best mobile under 10000 INR .. General , LAVA A series , Smartphone under INR 5000 , Uncategorized. There is a big market in India for budget smartphones. As the Government of India’s initiatives like Digital India and its recent push for digitisation of all transactions in India takes hold, more people are looking to buy smartphones. Here, we take a look at some ultra-low budget smartphones offered by Indian mobile phone maker LAVA Mobiles. The company offers serious competition to the Chinese handsets flooding the market by launching handsets with better build quality, performance and software features.. One of the best looking phones in the low-budget smartphone category, the LAVA A67 is a value-for-money smartphone priced under INR 5000. It offers a quad core processor clocked at 1.2 Ghz and comes with 512MB of RAM to run all basic apps like Facebook and WhatsApp smoothly. You can also play low intensity games on the phone and the phone offers expandable storage up-to 32 GB. It has a dual SIM 3G setup, making the A67 an exciting prospect for budget phone buyers. The phone has a large 5” screen and features 5 megapixel primary camera and a 2 megapixel. Another 4.5-incher, the LAVA A68 is a cousin of the A67, with a comparable feature set. Albeit the difference here is some generational updates as the RAM gets beefed up to 1GB and the software package being updated to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. However, the front camera is downgraded from 2.0 megapixels to 0.3 and the screen size is also a palm friendly 4.5 inches. The processor in both phones remains the same whereas internal storage is doubled. We find both phones to be an attractive buy for smartphones priced under 5000 INR. You can go for either one of these handsets and rest assured of the best value for your money.. The A51 is a precursor to the A67, we are including it here because it matches the A67 almost feature for feature and can be bought at a discount on some online portals. That makes it an attractive buy for people on a tight budget. The LAVA A51 has double the internal storage of the A67 but has a smaller front camera with only 0.3 megapixel depth. If selfies are not a priority for you and you are not a stickler for Android versions, this might just be the phone for you.. The ultra-low budget smartphone market has enticed phone makers for years now, even Google has been trying to tap into this space with initiatives like “Android One”, yet there are few companies which can deliver a consistent enough user experience and LAVA mobiles is definitely a serious contender in this category.. General , Tips and tricks , Uncategorized. While it was not possible to snap up a phone with 3GB RAM under 10,000 Rupees in the market until a few months ago, today LAVA offers a number of exciting phones in this segment.. With some prudent research, you can buy a phone with 3GB RAM under 10000 INR online. Here are a few options offered by LAVA Mobiles, an Indian manufacturer of quality smartphones , which are quickly gaining popularity among Indian youth.. The wide aperture lens in LAVA X10 camera lets you create memories like no other device does in the budget segment. Add to it the facts that it’s one of the few phones with 3GB RAM under INR 10000 and you have a winner in your hands.. Powered by MediaTek’s quad-core processor, the X10 handles everything with ease. Another highlight of the phone is the massive 2900mAh battery that lets you do away with the charger for the day once it is fully charged.. If you want a phone with a large screen with Gorilla Glass protection, the LAVA X10 has a 5” gorgeously lit display that will bring your photos and videos to life. Coming with dual SIM and 4G connectivity, the X10 is a winner in every aspect.. This stylish piece of hardware comes wrapped in a polycarbonate plastic shell, tapered beautifully at edges and a 2.5D front glass panel protected by Corning Gorilla Glass. The phone comes with Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) out-of-the-box and is powered by a 64-bit MediaTek SoC clocked at 1.3GHz. The highlight, of course is the 3GB RAM which gives the phone enough headspace to accommodate the most demanding of modern apps and games easily.. The LAVA X81 is packed with features, including a dual 4G SIM setup, dual cameras 13 and 8 megapixel for primary and front facing units respectively, and a plethora of connectivity options like WiFi, Bluetooth and expandable storage.. The last entry is the cheapest of the lot but by no means a slouch, and this is what we love about LAVA. The company’s ability to offer value-for-money at each price point is unmatched.. The V2 is a beautifully designed handset and feels more premium than its price suggests. The sharp edges and industrial design can draw some serious envy from the onlookers. Add to that the processing power of a quad-core processor and 3GB RAM and you have a gadget that gives any competition a run for the money.. The LAVA V2 is a dual SIM 4G enabled device. The V2 runs on Android Marshmallow, ensuring that you have the latest security enhancements to protect your personal data. The dual camera setup on the phone is capable of clicking some seriously professional looking images and videos. You are not lacking on the pixel front either with the phone sporting 13-megapixel primary camera and an 8-megapixel selfie shooter. Although the low budget smartphone segment is seeing a lot of action these days, and the more and more Chinese smartphone companies are entering the fray. If you are in the market for a budget smartphone and want something reliable and good looking, these smartphones by LAVA mobiles are definitely worth consideration..

Their comparatively small units are designed to be compact rather than excel at low light photography. This is particularly bad news when you consider that everyone carries their phone with them and you never know when a good picture moment may crop up or when you want to take photos at a party.. However, you can always tweak certain settings and take some really impressive pictures.. Don’t use the onscreen shutter button. In low light conditions, the camera shutter is open for a much longer time. This means that even the slightest movement could result in a blurred photograph. To avoid this, you could make the volume rocker take a picture with an app like Volshutter Camera or you could use a short timer and hold the phone while it clicks.. The best way to improve low light conditions is by adding a bit more light. While your Lava best selfie smartphone will most probably have an LED flash, it can make your images seem dull and flat. Experiment by using a candle or a fireplace or a lamp or something and you could get a very interesting picture.. Your Lava smart phone will have a bunch of settings for you to explore. Try playing around with the white balance as well as the exposure settings and you could get a much better picture. You could also change the ISO levels in order to control the sensitivity of the camera.. There are many apps like Snapseed that can help you improve your low light images and make them a bit brighter. They can also add some filters that can really add character to the image. However, apps can do nothing to improve a blurry image, so make sure that you hold your hand steady.. Look for character rather than clarity. Some pictures may turn out to be a little grainy, but that’s ok. A filter can really help bring out an image. Experiment with coloured and monochrome filters and turn your grainy pictures into works of art.. For more information visit: www.lavamobiles.com.

GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) was developed to replace the analog cellular network (1G), therefore it is referred to as a 2G mobile network. It has been improved with the addition of General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and later via the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology.. W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) is an air interface used by 3G mobile networks. It is one of the three different UMTS interfaces together with the TD-SCDMA and the TD-CDMA. The standard provides faster data transfer speeds and allows more users to connect to the network simultaneously.. There are several network technologies that enhance the performance of mobile networks mainly by increased data bandwidth. Information about the communication technologies supported by the device and their respective uplink and downlink bandwidth.. Information about the operating system used by the device as well as its version.. The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second.
