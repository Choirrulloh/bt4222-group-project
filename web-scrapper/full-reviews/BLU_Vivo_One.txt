If all you want is an unlocked phone with a big screen and killer battery life, then perhaps you'll be happy with the R1 Plus. I generally want more from my phone, which is why I find the R1 Plus hard to recommend.. One of the most affordable Android phones we've ever tested. The Blu R1 Plus is the 2017 sequel to one of the cheapest Android phones on Amazon, and it’s back: faster, sturdier and longer lasting than before. At $159 (or $109 on sale at launch) it has a completely adequate HD display, metal finish and long battery life.

Just don’t expect 3D games to perform well or have it run the latest version of Android anytime soon. This is a true budget phone for the sub-$200 crowd.. A low-end, budget-friendly phone that offers a vanilla Android experience. The BLU Advance 5.0 shows that $60 can take you places, but those places are often bumpy, with problems to follow.. Many praise its lack of bloatware, pure Android experience, budget-friendly price tag and ability to run games with relative ease..

This phone gets a lot right, with a solid design and build quality, decent performance, a clean software package, and an unbeatable price point. The camera experience is a bit of a let down, and the ads, if you go for the Prime version, can get annoying, but at this price, these are understandable compromises to make. If you are looking for a good option on a budget, the BLU R1 HD should definitely be considered.. Insanely cheap for what it does. This is the phone for when you break your real phone and need to fill the gap until you’re ready for a true upgrade.

This is the phone for when you break your real phone and need to fill the gap until you’re ready for a true upgrade. This is the phone you get if you feel like your life would benefit from a second smartphone but don’t want to commit to the idea. Better still, this is the phone you don’t get, but use as a baseline for how inconceivably good and how cheap smartphones have gotten. The Blu R1 HD isn’t better than anything. A decent smartphone for as low a price as possible. The Blu R1 HD is certainly affordable, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bargain. The phone's design, display and battery life are satisfactory for a low-cost device, but its weak camera and inability to run graphically demanding apps serve as a constant reminder that this is a budget option..
