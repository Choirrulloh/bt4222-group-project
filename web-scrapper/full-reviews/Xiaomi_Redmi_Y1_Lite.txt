The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Xiaomi announces the Redmi Y1 and the Redmi Y1 Lite. Xiaomi Android Announcement. Xiaomi had an event today in India where two phones were introduced within a new smartphone series - the Xiaomi Redmi Y1 and the Redmi Y1 Lite .. Both phones might be part of new series, but they are already familiar. The phones are the global versions of the Redmi Note 5A Prime and the Redmi Note 5A, released in September in China.. The Xiaomi Redmi Y1 has a 5.5 LCD with Full HD resolution and a Snapdragon 435 chipset with an octa-core CPU clocked at 1.4 GHz. There are two memory options - 3 GB RAM + 32 GB storage or 4 GB RAM + 64 GB storage.. The phone runs MIUI 8 on Android Nougat 7.0, but it should get MIUI 9 by the end of the year.. Xiaomi spent plenty of time at the event talking up the selfie camera. It has a 16 MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture and 76-degree lens, paired with an LED flash. The camera on the back actually has a lower-resolution 13 MP sensor.. Exclusive Xiaomi Redmi Y1 hands-on images. The phone comes with a fingerprint sensor on the back as well as a trio of card slots so two nano SIMs and a microSD can be accommodated at the same time.. The 3GB RAM/32GB storage Xiaomi Redmi Y1 will go for INR8,999 ($140), while the more premium 4GB/64GB option is INR10,999 ($170).. The lite version of the Redmi Y1 shares the specs of the Redmi Note 5A. There is a Snapdragon 425 chipset and 2 GB RAM and a 5.5 LCD of 720p resolution.. The selfie camera has a rather basic 5 MP sensor, but the main one has the same resolution as the non-Lite version - 13 MP. The fingerprint scanner is gone from the back, though. Not a particularly fancy specs sheet, but the Xiaomi Redmi Y1 Lites price stands at the sweet INR6,999 (under $110), so the value for money proposition seems outstanding..

Great phone , liked the user interface smooth and easy to use, although the front of the phone looks very cheap and of low quality whereas the back looks like a premium phone... If the front of the phone would have been similar to the back I would have given 5 stars, otherwise it's pretty easy to get use too... No Oreo it seems a drawback frankly at least miui 9 will be made available so that's a good thing... Could have made it a little more smaller a lot of screen size is wasted.. okay phone but I prefer Redmi 4 over this...

Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Fabulous phone. At the time this was purchased, it was the best phone for the low price of INR 6,999. This Y1 is an Amazon exclusive product. It is a decent phone for the Indian market. It covers all the bands used in India. It does not support carrier agregation. And the dual SIM feature has a few issues, such as only one can be used at a time. This means if you use one SIM on a phone call and the other SIM is selected for data, only one works. The other manufacturers are now producing products that have better features for a lower price.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Four Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 3.0 out of 5 stars Three Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars awesome... 5.0 out of 5 stars Like. 1.0 out of 5 stars One Star. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars.

Xiaomi Launches the Redmi Y1, Redmi Y1 Lite and MIUI 9 Global ROM in India. 2017 – Mi MIX 2 / Mi Note 3 / Mi 6 / Mi Max 2 / Redmi Note 4 / Redmi Note 4X / Redmi Note 5A / Redmi 4 / Redmi 4X / Redmi Y1 / Redmi Y1 Lite. 2016 – Mi MIX / Mi Note 2 / Mi 5 / Mi 5s/ Mi 5s Plus / Mi Max / Mi Max Prime / Redmi Note 3 / Redmi 3 / Redmi 3S / Redmi 3S Prime / Redmi 4 / Redmi 4A. 2015 – Mi Note / Mi 4i / Redmi 2 / Redmi 2 Prime / Redmi Note 4G Prime / Redmi Note 2. 2014 – Mi 4/ Redmi Note 4G. At an event in New Delhi, Xiaomi has launched a new selfie-focused branding to compete against other Chinese OEMs in this fast growing market segment in India. The Redmi Y1 and the Redmi Y1 Lite are the global variants of the Redmi Note 5A Prime and the Redmi Note 5A that were launched in China a few weeks ago. Xiaomi also chose this event to unveil the global version of MIUI 9, with features designed for India.. The Redmi Y1 is the first phone from Xiaomi’s latest series which focuses on selfie-camera performance on a budget. The phone comes bearing all the typical highlights of a Xiaomi device, boasting of a capable hardware package with a competitive price tag.. The device looks like a typical Xiaomi device with its 5.5″ HD display, front capacitive buttons, rear fingerprint scanner as well as overall product design. There are no particular risks on the device — Xiaomi plays it safe and that’s understandable keeping in mind the pricing and target audience.. The Redmi Y1 comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 octa-core SoC, coupled with RAM and internal storage combinations of 3GB + 32GB or 4GB + 64GB. The phone does come with microSD expandability, and this time around, there is a dedicated slot alongside the dual nano SIM slots. While the phone may not shine when it comes to sheer performance value like Xiaomi’s other phones, it does have sufficient horsepower to keep the average consumer content. The phone comes with a 3080 mAh battery, and other extras like an IR Blaster and a 3.5mm headphone jack.. The highlight of the phone is it’s 16MP, f/2.0 front camera that comes with a front LED as well. Features in MIUI like Beautify 3.0 augment the camera hardware to enhance your selfies. There is also a 13MP, f/2.0 rear camera with PDAF.. The Redmi Y1 Lite is similar in hardware to the Redmi Y1, except for a few step downs.. The Y1 Lite uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC, and comes with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. The phone also lacks a fingerprint sensor, which is a strange decision to take for a device that is being launched in 2017 and will be sold in 2018 as well.. The front camera also gets bumped down to 5MP, and there is no front LED flash to boast of either.. The Redmi Y1 and Redmi Y1 Lite will be available in India from November 8, 2017 onwards across Xiaomi’s online and offline channels. Xiaomi also added in Reliance Digital as its newest offline partner, making its products much more widely available across India.. 8,999 (~$140) for the 3GB RAM variant and Rs. 10,999 (~$170) for the 4GB RAM variant; while the Redmi Y1 Lite costs Rs. Xiaomi’s Product Lead Jai Mani spent good time on stage to unveil MIUI 9’s Global ROM and highlight several of its features that have been designed specifically for the non-Chinese market.. Notably, notifications in the dropdown have finally received improvements to bring them closer to AOSP behavior. You can now expand notifications with a one-finger gesture, as well as use features like Quick Reply and bundled notifications.. Android’s split screen functionality also received an upgrade in the form of a quick window swap button. Double tapping the button on the split screen pane will quickly swap the position of the windows.. MIUI 9’s App Vault feature is similar in functionality to OnePlus’s Shelf feature on its own launcher. Users can swipe left on the homescreen to perform several quick actions, such as taking notes, scanning QR codes and booking a cab.. MIUI 9 also focuses on faster app launches and a smoother UI with reduced latency. We will have to wait for the experience to reach more users to comment on their claims.. MIUI 9 also focuses on India specific additions such as support for Lunar calendar complete with festival cards for 26 major festivals of India.. Xiaomi has also launched the Mi Calculator and Mi Explorer as standalone apps on the Google Play Store, with Mi Drop also on its way to the store in the coming weeks.. MIUI 9 will be rolling out to the following Xiaomi smartphones:. MIUI 9 Global ROM will begin its staged. rollout to Redmi Note 4, Mi Max 2, and Mi MIX 2 from November 3, 2017.

But i think Xiaomi Note 4x series smartphones are the very best mobile by features and prices. Though there are a lot of smartphones in the market, gadget-group.com only sells Note 4x and Redmi 4x series, because most of the Bangladeshi people like to buy these smartphones for their lowest price with latest features and camera.. Do you have any shop in Bangladesh, Rabby?. As an Xiaomi smartphone lover i appreciate your nice article, and thanks for the great review.. Ar kajol – January 8, 2018.
