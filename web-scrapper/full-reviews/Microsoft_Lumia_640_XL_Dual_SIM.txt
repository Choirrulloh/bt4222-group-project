The Problems I Got since May 31, 2015 When Both Sims Are Activated: (it kinda block my cellular data). Pictures won't show up at all although U can see it is downloading or it takes a very long time. Pictures on Facebook posting take a (very) long time to show up or IT DOES NOT SHOW UP AT ALL. On the top it says: "We can't refresh the news feed right now. Try again in a few minutes". I can not open the Friend Request section on fb. Sometimes It need me to switch back to other apps back and forward quite a few times before I can open it. * Can Not see all the pictures inside a folder on OneDrive. * Can Not upload a single photo to a folder on OneDrive. * The first page is open normally, but when I tried to click on a menu it will not open (blank). * It took ONE MINUTE just to load the page. It took only (half) ONE SECOND to load the page with a single SIM. * And some other issues that I forgot to mention. When I use one SIM card only, I do not get the problems mentioned above. This ones happened a few times only, when I use Wi-Fi with both Sims activated, I got a little bit problem similar to the problems mentioned above, but not always or you can say, very seldom.. So yeah this is about not getting the internet data fluently when both Sims are on its place. However, this is a dual SIM phone, and it has to be running well when we place both sim cards on its slot, and the truth is just the opposite.. Many thanks for your kind attention and hoping for any solution or ideas.. I have the same question (38). * Please try a lower page number.. * Please try a lower page number.. In reply to Aditya X17's post on July 19, 2015. I have checked and re-checked my date & time settings and Sim Card configuration from mobile providers.. Both are on the right setting and configuration (I follow instructions from mobile providers). The result is still the same. When dual SIM card is active it will bring problem to internet access. Just now I re-re-checked the problem and it stays there. (First SIM card 3G and second SIM card no internet access). The first one did not allowed me to login AT ALL ( I tried three times and cannot login) and the speed was turned to slow. The second website allowed me to login but the speed was slow. When I turn off dual Sims and use only the first SIM (I use only 3G depends on the signal). Both websites opened fast and I was able to login to both of them without any problem.. There is a problem when dual SIM is activated (dual stand by), however I cannot tell if this is a software or hardware problem. If I bring my Microsoft Lumia 640 XL to Nokia Service Center in my town, I do not know whether they can fix this kind of problem easily.. 5 people were helped by this reply. In reply to bwong23's post on July 27, 2015. Hi, have you found anything? I have the same issue with my 640 XL (non-LTE). Thanks for the "pointer" that it might be a dual-SIM issue, I observed intermittent data drops but couldn't pinpoint it.. What I noticed is that it only seems to affect certain operators as I had no issues in full dual-sim configs for some other operators in my region.. In reply to T_F4's post on August 7, 2015. My Microsoft Lumia XL 640 Dual Sim is also NON LTE.. I will check the internet quality with different operators and I will get back to you.. In reply to bwong23's post on August 7, 2015. Can you by any chance check what band(s) the operator you have problem with operates on?. I have found it's only the operator working on 850MHz band that I have issues with. All other operator SIMs in my region worked fine, with no drops. And today, I have confirmed that switching off 2nd SIM really solves the issue so thanks for that.. In reply to T_F4's post on August 7, 2015. I have checked that my Lumia 640 XL get problems on a frequency of 2100 MHZ (one of my sim card have two frequencies, 2100/900). I checked on the link you gave me.. when the second sim card is active:. * I can not send a message on Facebook Messenger.. As soon as I deactivated the second sim, I was successfully sent my message on Facebook Messenger.. * Also, my Lumia could not show some piages (where you can touch the pictures and open a new page on websites).. So, the list can keep going on with new problems.. Maybe the only solution is to wait for Windows 10 Mobile go on public on October?.. I think there is no solution right now except to DEACTIVATE THE SECOND SIM CARD while using internet. For that, I need to go back and forward on settings in order to activate and deactivate the second sim card.. Did I get a defect Lumia?. Will this problem be solved by software update or wait for Windows 10 Mobile?.. Or this is because of a poor quality asurance at the factory?.. In reply to bwong23's post on September 14, 2015. Thanks for confirming I think it is a hardware or firmware (not operating system) issue as it happens only when the 1st SIM operates on 2100 MHz, which is relatively rare. I tried it with 2-SIM configuration with operators that are not on 2100 MHz and. the issue did not appear (same second SIM). Wondering if anyone from MS monitors this thread or what's the best way to raise this.. In reply to T_F4's post on September 14, 2015. My first sim is on frequency 2100. My second sim is on frequency 900/2100. When I deactivate my second sim card, that means my first sim card is still on frequency 2100 and by doing that some or most of the problems are gone.. My situation maybe different than yours, but it is definitely a problem with (a few or some) Microsoft Lumia 640 XL Dual Sim.. Maybe some of Microsoft Lumia 640 XL owners do not care about the problems or just do not know there is a problem.. I am a BIG Fan of Lumia series and I hope this small but annoying problems does not carried away to Windows 10 Mobile 950 XL Dual Sim or what ever dual sim series because this time Microsoft/Lumia needs to proof to the people of the world.. Please do not let us down again and again Microsoft.. I always promoting my Microsoft Lumia 640 XL and my other Lumias to my friends and more. And some of them bought Lumias or going to buy new released Lumia.. In reply to bwong23's post on September 14, 2015. Yes that totally aligns with my issue.. - If the first SIM operates on 2100 MHz network and second SIM is active (even with data disabled) the. - If the first SIM operates on other than a 2100 MHz network and second SIM is active there is. - If the first SIM operates on 2100 MHz (or other) and second SIM is inactive there is. I have tested this with a combination of different operators for SIM1 and SIM2.. I suspect this is a relative rare problem because 2100 MHz networks are relatively few and not all countries import the dual sim version of 640 XL.. In reply to T_F4's post on September 14, 2015. Thank you T_F4 for your time testing it. I hope Microsoft is doing something to fix this problem so it will not occur in the future (uhumm Oct 06).. * Please try a lower page number.. * Please try a lower page number..

Microsoft Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM Review: Bigger Isn't Always Better. Kunal Dua , 11 April 2015. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Not too long ago, big-screen phones were called phablets, indicating their in-between status between the phones and tablets. Almost no one uses that term anymore, with large-screen smartphones now being known as, well, phones. Apple was pretty much the last one to acknowledge this trend, but last year's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were lapped up in record numbers, indicating an almost insatiable consumer appetite for big-screen phones.. Earlier, Microsoft Devices - then Nokia - had forayed into the world of large phones with the Lumia 1320 and Lumia 1520. While the 1520 was a flagship-class device, the 1320 was relatively modest in terms of specifications. The Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM - announced at MWC alongside the Lumia 640 Dual SIM and other variants - is in many ways a successor to the 1320, though the company stopped short of officially positioning it as such.. Does the 640 XL pack in enough features and value to worry its Android brethren? Let's find out.. Design and display The 640 XL Dual SIM is a quintessential Lumia - solidly built using good quality plastic, with a variety of colour options to choose from. It makes no effort to stand out in any way, and strange as that may sound, that's not necessarily a bad thing in our opinion.. The Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM comes with a 5.7-inch 720p display. While the display has no issues when it comes to colour reproduction or viewing angles, the pixel density leaves a lot to be desired. This isn't noticeable while you are looking at live tiles or viewing pictures, but as soon as you start reading text, pixelation issues come to the fore.. Microsoft's decision to use a 720p screen in a bid to keep the costs down is understandable, but on a 5.7-inch display, is perhaps a step too far. We'd highlighted similar concerns in our Lumia 1320 review , so nothing seems to have changed on that front.. The pixelation problem wouldn't have been as bad if Microsoft had stuck to a 5-inch display; that would've certainly helped with our other complaint with the device - the top part of the screen is simply too hard to reach comfortably while using the phone with one hand.. We've all become used to large-screen phones, most companies seem to have settled on 5.5-inch as the upper limit, though there have of course been outliers like the Google Nexus 6. The 5.7-inch display is actually smaller than the one of the Lumia 1520 and the 1320, but the phone still feels too bulky for day-to-day use.. Software Lumia 640 XL runs Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 out of the box, which includes all the features of the Lumia Denim update with some other enhancements. These new features include improvements to the Settings app, where you can get to any setting quickly by using the in-app search. You can also pin frequently-used individual settings (such as Wi-Fi) to your home screen as a live tile. Simply tap and hold down any setting and you'll see the pin to start option.. Settings now also include app permissions that lets you control which apps have access to your Camera, Microphone, as well as Contacts, Messaging, and Calendar data.. The Lumia 640 XL comes preloaded with a host of Lumia-branded apps like Lumia Beamer, Lumia Camera, Lumia Cinemagraph, Lumia Creative Studio, Lumia Moments, Lumia Selfie, and Lumia Storyteller. Pre-installed third-party apps include BBM, BookMyShow, Facebook, Fitbit, Foodpanda, MobiKwik, NDTV, Olacabs, and WeChat. Thankfully, you can uninstall these apps should you so desire.. Unfortunately, there are no software tweaks that make use of the additional real estate - not even a token Reachability-like tweak seen on the newer, bigger iPhone models - and certainly nothing like Android's floating apps that put the increased screen space to great use. Having said that, most Android phones in this price range also suffer from the same faults, so it would be unfair to single Microsoft out on this point. The Lumia 640 XL will be upgradable to Windows 10, and this is one area where Microsoft certainly scores over the Android world.. All UI elements are simply scaled up to the new size, which means there are other annoyances like increased space between rows of keys on the keyboard, which takes some getting used to.. Camera Outdoors and in good lighting conditions, the 13-megapixel Lumia 640 XL camera captures decent details, though the images tend to be just a little-bit over-exposed with some amount of noise. Noise is more of an issue in low-light conditions, but overall the camera does a pretty decent job in terms of managing light and maintaining image quality. The flash does a decent job of lighting up the subjects evenly.. The camera captures high-quality full-HD video with good audio clarity. The front camera is perfect for good quality selfies, even in low-light conditions.. Performance and battery life The Lumia 640 XL comes with a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 SoC with 1GB RAM. In synthetic benchmarks, the phone comes nowhere near Android phones that are now available at a similar price, but with Windows Phone's ability to play nice with limited resources, users are unlikely to find the difference as dramatic. We experienced no touchscreen issues like those that marred the Lumia 535 Dual SIM .. The smartphone comes with 8GB of inbuilt storage, less than half of which is available to the end users, which means you'll need to factor in the purchase of a SD card should you wish to do anything useful with the 640 XL. The phone supports cards of up to 128GB capacity, and Windows Phone lets you install apps directly to the SD card, so this is not a huge downside other than the additional cost.. The Lumia 640 XL comes with on-screen buttons for navigation, instead of physical buttons, which means navigating out of full-screen environments - like when you are viewing a picture or watching a movie - takes an additional swipe to first bring up the navigation buttons. This may not be a big deal for some, but we certainly wish Microsoft had gone with physical buttons instead.. The phone features a 3000mAh battery that will easily last a day-and-a-half of heavy usage. The call quality is good and the loudspeaker - situated at the back - is pretty decent for calls as well as your dose of entertainment. You can double tap the display to wake up, which means you don't need to reach for the power button every time.. Verdict During pre-launch interactions, Microsoft said it is positioning the Lumia 640 XL against Samsung's Grand series of mid-range, large-screen devices; explicitly dismissing the challenge posed by the likes of Xiaomi, Micromax, and others in the same segment. The company seems to have missed that the Grand series no longer enjoys the mindshare it once did, and by pricing the phone at Rs. 15,799, Microsoft certainly fails to acknowledge the existence of the Xiaomi Redmi Note and Micromax's Yu Yureka , amongst others that offer similar specifications - and an ecosystem with a much bigger collection of apps - at nearly half the price.. Like nearly all Lumia phones, the Lumia 640 XL stands out for its battery life and camera performance, but overall it's hard to recommend this device to anyone given the options already available in the market..

Author Sunil Jamboor Nagesh Posted on May 30, 2015 June 3, 2015 Categories Featured , Microsoft , Reviews , Windows. "Microsoft Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM Review" , 2 out of 5 based on 39 ratings.. Microsoft recently announced its Lumia 640 series, consisting of two devices – Lumia 640 Dual SIM and Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM. We already reviewed the former, but the 640 XL is the better-equipped smartphone.. Microsoft with its 640 series is trying to offer a smartphone to everyone out there and thus we have these diversities. We have spent some quality time with Lumia 640 XL to understand if it offers any value to its price tag and here’s our detailed review.. Microsoft Lumia 640 XL comes in a standard retail box with the phone branding all over the package. The regulatory details and the key hardware specifications have been mentioned on the rear of the box.. On opening the package, you first see the device itself and on further inspection you find the A/C adapter, headset and some paperwork.. Unfortunately, the company is not including a microUSB cable and you will have to buy one separately. It would have been great if Microsoft could have included a USB cable that could even double up as a power cord.. Microsoft is continuing the trend of Nokia Lumia shell design with its latest mid-ranger. This also means that Lumia 640 XL will look just like any other Lumia device. Microsoft could have easily innovated and offered something new, but instead the company has gone with a tried and tested formula.. The Lumia 640 XL comes with a plastic removable rear cover and it fits perfectly without any squeaks. The back shells will be available in a wide range of vibrant covers – something we are already familiar with Lumia devices. Some of these colored panels are offered in matte finish, but we personally like the glossy finished ones, as they are more attractive.. Microsoft Lumia 640 XL measures 157.9 x 81.5 x 9mm about measures about 171 grams. Even though the weight seems to be on the heavier end, the device doesn’t feel heavy in hands and that’s mainly due to its huge form factor.. The matte version of the smartphone offers good grip and fits well in the hands, while the glossy back panels are quite slippery and is fingerprint prone.. On the front, the 640 XL has a huge 5.7-inch IPS with ClearBlack display technology. So, the front is pitch black when the display is turned off. Apart from the screen, you find the earpiece and the 5-megapixel front facing camera along with a bunch of sensors. The primary microphone pinhole is just below the screen.. The left side of the Lumia 640 XL is completely bare, while the volume rockers and the power button is located on the right.. Microsoft Lumia 640 XL has the 3.5mm audio jack on the top and apart from it there’s nothing else there.. The microUSB port is cenetered at the bottom on the Lumia 640 XL.. Moving to the rear, the 13 megapixel ZEISS lens can be found. The camera is accompanied by a LED flash and laudspeaker grille.. As mentioned earlier, the 640 XL has a revomable back panel and underneath it lies the SIM card slots and microSD card slot.. Microsoft Lumia 640 XL sports a 5.7-inch ClearBlack IPS display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels and accounts to a pixel density of 259ppi. The sharpness and the image quality is quite satisfactoy.. The viewing angles are not great, but pretty decent. The color rendering is quite accurate and the contrast is good. However, the blacks on the 640 XL are not so great and we found out the pixel density to be only average.. The brightness at 100% is good and the sunlight legibility is excellent, which means you don’t have to find a shetter to view the screen even in the brightest day.. Microsoft is also offering some software assistance to improve the performance of the display on the Lumia 640 XL. The Color profile application allows you to tune the saturation and color balance to match your taste.. Microsoft’s Lumia 640 XL comes with the latest Windows Phone 8.1 operating system out of the box. Furthermore, the device also has the latest Lumia Denim pre-installed. The Redmond giant announced the 640 series along with the Windows 10 OS and the company has promised firmware upgrade for the Lumia 640 XL.. The Windows Phone 8.1 on Lumia 640 XL has folder support and also has the newly introduced personal assistant, Cortana on-board. The settings menu is now well organized and the overall experience has gotten a lot better.. With the latest software, the Glance Screen feature on the 640 XL offers more features. Apart from the clock, you can now view notification on the lockscreen for pre-configured applications.. The Lumia 640 XL brings the latest Internet Explorer 11 mobile web browser, which now supports private browsing, unlimited tab support, bookmark synchronization and reader mode.. Microsoft’s OneNote also comes preinstalled and OneDrive is integrated to the OS. You view and edit documents, excel and powerpoint for free.. The Lumia exclusive applications like Storyteller and Creative studio are available on Lumia 640 XL. Just in case you aren’t aware, the Lumia Storyteller application creates stories from your photos based on where and when it was taken.. Microsoft’s answer to Google Now and Apple’s Siri is Cortana. The virtual assistant has the ability to recognize voice commands and responds to it in human language. Cortana can also track what’s trending, keep a tab of breaking news, make cooking suggestions, find places, plan trip among other things. We noted during our testing that it has a very good sense of humour.. The Indian variant of the Lumia 640 XL comes with some localized applications like FoodPanda and MobiKiwi and BookMyShow.. Microsoft is using Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset to power its latest Lumia 640 XL smartphone. The silicon has a quad-core processor clocked at 1.2 GHz and Adreno 305 graphics processing unit.. Just like most the Lumia devices, the 640 XL has 1GB of RAM. Even though the Windows Phone operating system is well optimized to run on lower end hardware, it’s quite difficult to understand why Microsoft has chosen a dated Snapdragon 400 for a 2015 smartphone.. The Snapdragon 400 is not a power house in any manner, so we do not expect it to top any of our benchmarking charts. We ran AnTuTu test just to be sure and here’s the result –. Microsoft says that their devices are never meant to top any benchmarks and instead their devices are focused on offering smooth Windows performance in real-world.. In our usage, the 640 XL did offer lag-free performance for day to day usage such as calling and messaging. However, the moment we tried to push it by launching heavy applications or multiple applications, we could notice delay and the smartphone got slow.. The performance is still pleasing if you are a non-power user. But, if you are a basic user of a phone, does buying a smartphone make sense? And, that too Lumia 640 XL at its price tag? Well, we’re not too sure.. Microsoft Lumia 640 XL is equipped with a 13 megapixel camera and an LED flash. Unlike previous Lumia devices, the 640 XL lacks a dedicated camera button.. The user interface of the Lumia camera is quite familiar and navigation between menus is very easy. The settings option such as focus, white balance, ISO, shutter speed and exposure are available. You can capture images with either 13 megapixel 4:3 or 10 megapixel 16:9 resolutions.. We took the device for a spin and capture some images to show it to you all. (Full resolution – Sample 1 , Sample 2 , Sample 3 , Sample 4 , Sample 5 , Sample 6 , Sample 7 ). The images captured with Lumia 640 XL camera had good amount of detail and the contrast is good. The color rending is accurate, but the noise levels are quite high. The white balance is automatically turned off sometimes, but overall the shooter performs well for a mid-range smartphone.. The rear camera on the Lumia 640 XL also doubles up as a camcorder and the user interface is similar to that of the still camera. The snapper has the ability to record videos at 1080 pixels @ 30 frames per second. It also has a solid bitrate of 17Mbps, but the videos recorded are in single channel AAC mode with 48KHz.. The video recording quality is quite satisfactory, but there’s lot of scope for improvement. The level of detail can get better and so is the overall dynamic range.. Microsoft Lumia 640 XL has a quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad band 3G with HSDPA. Unfortunately, the Indian variant doesn’t support 4G LTE networks at the moment.. The dual-SIM device has dual standby and offers a wide range of connectivity options. It has dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA, Wi-Fi Hotspot and Bluetooth 4.0.. The juice for the Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM comes from a 3,000mAh battery and during review process it did get our battery test treatment.. According to the company, the device offers about 23 hours of 3G talk time. However, in our test the device managed to last more than that with charts reading 27 hours and 20 mins.. The detailed breakdown of the battery consumption will be posted on our blog in the next couple of days. So, keep a close eye on our blog wall. Meanwhile, if you aren’t aware of our test, then feel free to check our battery test introduction story to know more about our procedure.. Microsoft introduced seven new models in its Lumia 640 series. The best variant among them is the Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM and if you happen to have big hands, then you’ll like handling the phablet. The device is currently available in the market for about INR 15,200.. If you are a hard core Lumia fan or using Lumia device for a while, then you’ll like the 640 XL. However, if you are new to Windows Phone ecosystem, then 640 XL leaves much to be desired.. The build quality of the Lumia 640 XL is great and we suggest you to pick a matte finish model over the glossy finish as they are slippery. The display is bright and the sunlight legibility is good. Lumia 640 XL has a very capable camera and it offers decent quality images. The video recording is also satisfactory.. The Windows Phone 8.1 with Denim is snappy and is undoubtedly the best version of WP OS till date. Microsoft has also promised Windows 10 update for the Lumia 640 XL.. The biggest let down is the processor and if you happen to be a power user, the Lumia 640 XL doesn’t sound like a right choice. We don’t understand why Microsoft picked the Snapdragon 400.. Considering the price tag of the device and what it has got to offer, we don’t think Lumia 640 XL offers good value for money. Also, it fails to compete with most of the Android competition out there.. If you are in the market looking for a mid-range smartphone, then you might want to look at Xiaomi Mi4i , ASUS ZenFone 5 and Moto G 2nd generation ahead of Microsoft Lumia 640 XL..

Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE Dual Sim. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good Both the screen and camera are among the best you'll find at this price, you can swap out the back panels for fresh colours, and the Windows Phone software is easy to use.. The Bad The front camera has a very poor resolution, the battery life is short, and the under-stocked app store won't please anyone wanting the latest apps and games.. The Bottom Line The great screen and camera make the Lumia 640 a brilliant phone for anyone on a budget who wants an alternative to Android -- so long as you aren't too bothered about apps.. Windows Phone software and processor performance. The budget end of the phone market is dominated by a slew of Android phones, most of which have near-identical black or grey designs and the same outdated software that slogs through even the basics.. The Microsoft Lumia 640 is a bit different however. It's running Windows Phone software, made up of big, colourful tiles that will come as a refreshing change to anyone that's become a little jaded with Android. It has a great 5-inch display, 4G LTE connectivity and an 8-megapixel camera. That's all wrapped up in plastic shells that are swappable and come in a range of vibrant colours.. You can buy the phone SIM-free directly from Microsoft in the UK for £120, or get it for free on a range of contracts starting at only £13.50 a month. The phone will be coming to the US, although it's currently listed as "coming soon" on Microsoft's site and prices aren't yet known. In Australia it's available outright and will cost you AU$299.. The Nokia name may have gone from the phone, but its design is still unmistakably a Lumia. It has the same one-piece back panel seen on almost all of the recent Lumia phones, which bends round to meet the screen at the front. It has more angular edges than the rounded Lumia 735 , but it's no less comfortable to hold.. The stiff plastic helps make it feel sturdy and well-built, and the interchangeable covers let you swap the colours to match your mood or your outfit. It also allows you to pop on a fresh panel when your existing one starts to look a bit battered and worn -- something you can't do with most phones. The bright colours and plastic body gives the phone a fun, child-like appearance, which helps it stand out from usually black and grey midrange Android phones.. It measures 141mm long, 72mm wide and is 8.8mm thick (that's roughly 5.5 by 2.75 by 0.34 inches). It's quite a big phone, but it's possible to type messages with just one hand -- although you'll likely need two hands if you're writing more than a sentence. jack is on the top, the Micro-USB power port on the bottom and the Micro-SIM and microSD card slots are found beneath the plastic back panel.. You'll want to make use of that microSD card slot, as the phone only comes with 8GB of onboard storage. Using the Storage Sense app, you can select an external SD card as the default place to store apps, photos and videos however, so make sure you pick up a 32GB card (they're incredibly cheap these days) if you plan on taking a lot of photos or playing games.. The 5-inch display has a 1,280x720-pixel resolution, resulting in a density of 294 pixels per inch. While that doesn't compare well to the full HD (and higher) flagship phones, it's perfectly adequate on a phone of this price. It's also more than enough to give the Windows Phone tiles a crisp edge and make even small text on Web pages look perfectly readable.. Colours are rich, as well, and there's a decent level of contrast which helps make dramatic movies on Netflix -- such as the awesome snowboarding movie "Art of Flight" -- look particularly luscious. The sheer size of the display provides a more immersive feel, too. It's bright enough to counter the overhead lights in the CNET UK office, although it may not fare as well in the bright summer sunshine.. The 640 runs the latest version of Windows Phone 8.1 , which is codenamed Denim. It's made up of the same scrolling list of colourful tiles that show live information, and that you can resize and rearrange to make the interface to your liking. The latest version of the OS brings much-needed updates like a pull-down panel showing incoming notifications and settings like the screen brightness and Wi-Fi.. Windows Phone is easy to use and actually quite fun, which is a nice alternative to the often clunky and bloated Android interfaces found on budget mobiles. The ability to make important tools such as the phone dialer and text messages appear as big tiles right on the front of the phone also means it's a good option for anyone who's nervous about taking their first steps into the smartphone world.. The understocked app store has always been a downside of Lumia phones, and that continues with the 640. While you can get most of the big names now, including WhatsApp, Netflix, Spotify and Instagram, Windows Phone almost always receives new apps much later than iOS or Android if it gets them at all. What's more, some popular apps like Facebook , for example, are developed by third parties with a quality level that doesn't quite compare to other mobile operating systems. If you love browsing the new upcoming apps on an iPhone and are always keen to try the latest indie games when your friends do, Windows Phone won't suit.. It's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 dual-core processor clocked at 1.2GHz, backed up by 1GB of RAM. That may not sound impressive on paper, but it's more than enough to make swiping around those colourful tiles swift and free of lag. Menus open without delay, editing photos in Adobe PhotoShop Express was tackled without incident, and even demanding games like Asphalt 8 played fairly smoothly.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

In the new smartphone era the diversity applied mostly to the color options, but today Microsoft is revisiting the past traditions with the new Lumia 640 series, which offers seven different handsets with attractive specs and bargain pricing.. Breaking a pattern is a tough move today, but it seems Microsoft got it right for the most part. You can get a Lumia 640 in a regular 5" size or a 5.7" XL flavor. There are 3G, 3G Dual SIM, LTE and even LTE Dual SIM version of each size, which is very nice - you can opt for the one you need and save some cash in the meantime. And, of course, the paintjob options are as rich as they get - matte cyan, glossy cyan, orange, black, matte white and glossy white.. So, we got the 3G Dual SIM model of the Microsoft Lumia 640 XL, one with a matte white panel. It is noticeably big, but feels really light, the Glance screen greets you at start and the ZEISS logo highlights the rear 13 MP camera. The 5.7" 720p display isn't offering the best pixel density, but it makes up for it with the ClearBlack technology. And while the Lumia 640 series was introduced as the first Windows 10 smartphones, they are still running on Windows Phone 8.1. They will be the first phones on the queue to get the update this summer though.. The Lumia 640 XL has pretty much all bases covered. The Snapdragon 400 chipset is our major concern. It proved a really powerful platform for the Windows smartphones in the past and is still utilized by many. But Microsoft's recent push of new apps and games within the Windows Store may finally raise performance issues on these kind of smartphones.. For a quick roundup of the Microsoft Lumia 640 XL you can check out our video review. It will give you an aggregated view of our written review and if you want the complete picture you can read on..

Microsoft Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM Price in the Philippines is Php 11,990 : In The Flesh Photos, Complete Specs. Looking for a new and affordable Windows Phone phablet that has a good camera, a decent set of technical specifications, and great battery life? Check out Microsoft Lumia 640 XL. Released in the Philippines last May 1, 2015, the Lumia 640 XL sells for only Php 11,990 and already comes with features - both in terms of hardware and software - that are sure to provide WP fans an intuitive and compelling user experience. "People are looking for a device which brings them more flexibility to switch easily between work and play, without breaking the bank. The Lumia 640 XL keeps people prepared for anything, with the full range of Microsoft experiences – including Office and OneDrive – which Lumia users have come to expect straight out of the box, a superb 5.7” HD screen and long lasting battery. As the age old demand for ‘more for less’ extends to the smartphone market, the Lumia 640 XL presents a strong option for those customers who want the increased productivity a smart device offers without sacrificing affordability," said Mr. Gary Chan , Microsoft Devices’ Head of Marketing in Pan Asia. Off hand, there are five things I love about this model. First, as you can see in these photos, it has a very youthful look that I find quite cute. Second, it's built like a tank; The polycarbonate back cover feels very solid in the hand. Third, the screen is plain ginormous. Fourth, the removable 3,000 mAh battery pack delivers almost a day and a half of talk time, and more than 12 hours of uptime with mixed usage -- and that's more than what other other smartphones in this price echelon will give you. Its 13 MegaPixel autofocus main camera features Carl Zeiss optics - similar to what's on legendary Nokia cameraphones in the past - which makes this handset one of the best budget cameraphones right now. This shooter is complemented by a 5 MP selfie cam in front, delivering clear and crisp selfies even in low light conditions. Aside from that, according to Microsoft, the Lumia 640 XL offers more personal computing and increased productivity through seamlessly integrated Microsoft Office experiences, OneDrive storage and fast connectivity. This phablet will also eventually benefit from the features of Windows 10 as it becomes available later this year. But right out of the box, Lumia 640 XL - powered by Quad Core 1.2 GHz ARM Cortex-A7 and Adreno 305 GPU based Qualcomm MSM8226 Snapdragon 400 chipset, having 1 GB of RAM, and coming with 8 GB of expandable storage - will already let you enjoy the latest version of Windows Phone 8.1 and the Lumia Denim update, complete with one-swipe Action Center, Word Flow and Live Folders.

Windows 7 laptop, USB-connecting the phone and this laptop installs a new set of drivers for the phone. Previously, that laptop had the Windows Phone app for Desktop installed, and could (and still can) connect a Nokia Lumia 920 phone.. Another Windows machine, running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, can also USB-connect to the Nokia Lumia 920.. recognize the new Microsoft Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM phone - both computer and phone beep, and Device Manager shows the drivers not installed. have removed the device, disconnected the phone cable, rebooted the Windows. desktop, then re-connected the phone* - and the unsuccessful install of the drivers again shows.. Windows offers to search for the drivers, and cannot find them.. * I have uninstalled the Windows Phone app for Desktop from the Windows Ultimate computer, and re-installed it of course. I have the same question (141). The phone app for desktop does nothing to help the phone connect to the PC .. You can stop with the uninstall/reinstall.. If the phone is connected it works. If the phone is not connected it will not work.. Don't start this program until the phone is finished connection.. Use the USB cable that came with the phone or the 920 data cable.. Connect the phone to the PC. Turn it all the way off, hold power button and slide the screen down. The phone will turn back on and it will be detected, drivers should load.. You should see it in windows explorer. It should install in 'portable devices' in the device manager.. 1 person was helped by this reply. In reply to garym123's post on July 8, 2015.

As mentioned, the 920 connects to both laptop and desktop computers.. Also, I am aware of the common problem, sometime with the 920 in my experience, that a power-off and power on again may be needed with USB connection.. And of course I have done that with the 640 XL.. So, not a solution to my problem.. Incidentally, the driver search fail message is (in part) as follows -. Windows was unable to install your Lumia 640 LTE Dual SIM (RM-1096). Windows cannot find driver software for your device.. The yellow ! remains for that device, under Other devices.. (A 3rd computer, a desktop Windows 8.1, never connected to any phone until now, immediately / transparently connects. Device Manager shows Windows Phone under Portable Devices, for the 640 XL).

I still have this problem with the Lumia 640 XL DS on Windows 7 - not so on other hardware, Windows 8.1. Has anyone found a solution? None of the suggestions above work for me, as indicated in my reply back a couple of weeks.. I've effectively retired Windows 7, using Windows 10 instead on the same hardware but using an SSD boot drive. So the problem is academic (still unsolved)..

I am also trying to figure out how to connect & manage files on two used lumia w8.1 phones from various win7 & win10 PCs. The phones charge fine, but nothing shows up in device manager. If I didn't have a brand new USB cable, I would suspect that. The MS page describing the "Improved desktop app for windows phone" has no download button, but it sounds like that would not help anyway.. Update: I checked and even though my cable has all the pins at the connectors, the data pins are not connected! It must be for charging purposes only. A real cable should fix it for me..
