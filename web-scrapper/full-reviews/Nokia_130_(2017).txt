more ... more .... more ... more .... Release date: Aug 1, 2017. Does not support automatic screen brightness. Low pixel density screen (114 ppi). Aside from the design aspect, there don't seem to be any differences between the old model and the all new Nokia 130. The feature phone sports a 1.8-inch display with 128 x 160 pixels resolution, 4MB RAM and 8MB ROM. A microSD card slot is included as well so that you can expand storage up to 32GB. FM Radio, along with 3.5mm audio jack and micro-USB 2.0 ports are available too.. Dimensions: 4.39 x 1.91 x 0.56 inches (111.5 x 48.4 x 14.2 mm). Resolution: 128 x 160 pixels. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. 0.004 GB RAM / 8 MB ROM. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Phone features Notifications: Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Availability Officially announced: 17 Jul 2017. Shopping information MSRP price: $ 22.

A device with a 1.8 inch dot dot screen? :D I wish they drop useless features like camera to keep the price low. Adding a browser will be a waste as for my view. Most (if not all) people buy feature (basic) phones just for calling and occasional text or as a backup phone.. Camera is a waste of precious money :-D I don't think anyone's gonna take a *nokia 130* in 2017 to a photo shoot :))). I bought 105 for about 17$... Didn't want to waste 10$ more on a camera which I'm never going to use. Plus 105 is more handsome looking (at least for my eyes) :-D. But consider the fact that Nokia 130 has a bigger batery compared to 105 model.. buttons are low quality, singnal strenth also not good as previous nokia mode. dont waste ur money buying ds model.. The call and signal quality is useless on these phones. I used an old Nokia from 2007 and it blows this crap out of the water. Without radio if you have not additional (optional) purchases. Very bad shortened manual (even manual is a big problem for this company!). Hadi, 04 Dec 2017 What is the material of buttons? Rubber or plastic? somewhat hard rubber.

Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better!

Bought to replace old Nokia C2-01. Firstly doesn't have 3G and network coverage not very good. Secondly, girl in shop said it had camera, maybe it does but you can't use it because phone says you need memory card.. Bought the old phone from Carphone Warehouse and had great service, can't say the same this time; I asked for a replacement for my Nokia C2-01 and this 130 is simply not a match.. Rated 1 out of. Great phone, ever lasting battery, shame no sim cards work in this phone as of only 2g sim cards compatable. and most providers have 3g and up... Rated 4 out of. I bought this phone recently and it is perfect except one important feature. I chose the pale grey model which was a big mistake. When you text, the letters on the key pads light up and become indistinct against the pale grey background. I took it back to car phone warehouse and tried to demonstrate what happens with a view to changing to the black. Under the shop lights it seemed to be ok and was also one day out of guarantee, so am unfortunately stuck with it.. Unless I am prepared to forfeit the £49 I spent on it and buy a black one I will have to continue to struggle to send texts act. A great pity, as this is is a design fault, the phone works brilliantly otherwise, simple and no extra unwanted stuff on it.. Rated 5 out of. It is a fantastic phone that is simple and durable for a lag so of use ue. Ha amazing no talk times and a retro casing to it.
