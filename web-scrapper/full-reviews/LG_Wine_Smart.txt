All the power of Android condensed into a 3.5-inch screen may be the best of both worlds for people who really love their flip phones.. by November 6, 2014 4:00 AM PST. The LG Wine Smart brings Android to a tried-and-true clamshell shape. Design and hardware specs It may be geared toward buyers in their later years, but the LG Wine Smart has cool golden racing stripe. For a certain portion of the population, one look at the clamshell LG Wine Smart will wash them in a wave of the stuff -- until they flip it open to reveal Android 4.4 KitKat on a 3.5-inch display.. Made in black or white with a sexy gold racing stripe, the smartphone version of the LG Wine family is big on large buttons on the keypad and tactile directional controls on the navigation array. You won't be typing long texts and email missives with that alphanumeric keyboard, but the touchscreen does offer basic functionality for opening apps such as the camera, and for sorting through menu options.. LG created the Wine Smart after conducting tests with older folks to see which typical smartphone elements intimidate them most. Small buttons and type, and confusing features were the results of this market research.. LG's Android flip phone has racing-stripe cool (pictures). Especially for people transitioning from a non-touch feature phone, the familiar 3 x 3 icon grid includes apps like a TV and radio to go along with the typical calendar and camera. In addition to the touch capability, five dedicated hardware keys map top functions like drafting a message and opening the camera.. A customizable convenience key lets you reprogram one of the buttons for your own use, and the tactile buttons that rise from the surface are easy to press. The 1 watt speaker promises loud ringing.. Up above, a heavily skinned version of Android 4.4.2 KitKat and simple settings make the functionality seemed toned down, but the Wine Smart is fully compatible with the Google Play store. Despite that, gameplay satisfaction will be very limited.. I really love the Wine Smart's unabashedly tactile look and feel, especially the black version with tis textured cross-hatch black cover (the white model has a smooth backing). The phone folds down to a size compact enough to stick into a pocket and carry around. The flipping motion takes a strong thumb at first if you're doing it one-handed, but the hinge is sturdy.. A loophole on the side of the phone lets you attach a charm, wristband, or a neck strap, the latter of which LG told CNET is especially popular among Japanese customers.. In terms of specs, you're looking at that 3.5 HVGA IPS screen (480x320-pixel resolution), and a 1.2GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor. An 8-megapixel rear-facing camera will still let phone owners take solid shots, though there's no emphasis on the VGA front-facing camera for selfies and video chats.. You'll also find an FM radio and Bluetooth 4.0 for pairing with other devices. The Wine Smart's 1,700mAh battery is about the right capacity for a screen of this size. Storage space is on the lower end with 4GB internal storage, but you'll be able to expand with an after-market microSD card slot (there's 1GB RAM). The phone's LTE radio supports VoLTE.. LG knows that the audience for its Wine Smart flip phone is limited, but has done a good job making the phone visually appealing for buyers. (As an aside, LG says that some students have shown interest in the phone as well as older adults.) I like the Wine Smart's cool look and pocketability, and the fact that it enhances a simple calling experience with practical helpmeets, like sharing photos online and turning on navigation.. The phone will sell in Korea for 399,000 won, which converts to about $370, £230 or AU$430, but expect final prices to vary significantly.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Best Phones for 2018.

Florian Wimmer ( translated by Bernie Pechlaner), 12/17/2015. Android ARM Smartphone. A retro-smartphone? A smart flip-phone? The LG Wine Smart is both at the same time and even comes with the still-current Android 5.1. A small display is unfortunately only one of the drawbacks inherent in the design..

Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here .. The wave of various retro-designs has engulfed smartphones as well and manufacturers like Samsung now offer flip (smart)phones. LG's entry goes by "LG Gentle" in Asia; in Europe the offering carries the somewhat awkward name "LG Wine Smart.". Equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 CPU, 3.2-inch display, 1 GB RAM and 4 GB of storage (expandable with a MicroSD card), the LG Wine Smart offers entry-level hardware and sells for a street price of about 160 Euros (~$175). Operating the smartphone is possible via the classic key pad or the touchscreen. Whether this design is truly contemporary or just a bad compromise is the subject of our review.. Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 MSM8909 Qualcomm Adreno 304. Test device courtesy of LG Deutschland. Download your licensed rating image as PNG / SVG. 3.2 inch 16:9, 480 x 320 pixel, capacitive touchscreen, TN LED, glossy: yes. 1 USB 2.0, Audio Connections: 3.5 audio combo-port, Card Reader: microSD up to 32 GB, Sensors: GPS, position, gyro. 802.11 b/g/n (b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.1, GSM (850/900/1800/1900), UMTS (850/900/1900/2100), LTE (B3/B7/B8/B20). height x width x depth (in mm): 16.6 x 117.7 x 58.7 ( = 0.65 x 4.63 x 2.31 in). 7 Wh Lithium-Ion, 1700 mAH, Battery runtime (according to manufacturer): 970 h, Talk time 2G (according to manufacturer): 19. h, Talk time 3G (according to manufacturer): 13.

Glossy, burgundy-red faux leather, plastic that looks like brushed aluminum: considering the affordable price, LG went to great lengths to spruce up the smartphone. Alternatively, the LG Wine Smart is also available in a dark blue color. There's no external display, which we would have expected - after all, this is a flip phone. A single LED alerts the user to a missed call or other notification.. The back cover is removable and allows access to the (swappable) battery as well as the Micro-SIM card and the microSD card slots. We like the fact that the microSD card can be swapped out without removing the battery.. Compared to modern smartphones, the LG Wine Smart is somewhat bulky with its thickness of 16.6 mm. The overall stability is not that great and especially the display unit is fragile and flexes when pressure is applied.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. Except for a micro-USB 2.0 port and a 3.5 mm headphone jack, the LG Wine Smart is lacking any additional physical ports.. LG ships the Wine Smart with the current Android 5.1. Even though Android 6.0 is available already, not a lot of phones are equipped as such. Operating the phone with the physical keys or the small touchscreen might feel awkward at first, but it actually works pretty well.. LG doesn't preinstall a lot of software and the OS itself is only slightly modified from the original Android version. There's an app for emergencies and a backup solution from LG. The advantage is that the user doesn't have to uninstall a lot of bloatware. Applications can also be moved to the microSD card.. The LG Wine Smart offers LTE but only supports quad-band. GSM and UMTS are limited to four frequencies each as well, so the smartphone is by no means a "global" phone. WLAN 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1 are par for the course for this price class.. Ten meters from our router and through three walls, the signal strength had dropped to about 50% and the reception quality was diminished with pages loading noticeably slower than they would closer to the router. Surfing the web is a bit of a chore since the display only measures 3.2-inches.. Since the phone features physical keys, the phone app works not quite like it would on a "normal" Android 5.1-equipped phone. For one, the functions - for example, the list of received calls - are now actual apps. Pushing a key starts the phone application; at this point the user can simply dial a number.. The sound quality is OK, but the microphone is less satisfactory and our partner did complain about our voices sounding muffled.. Unlike current smartphones, the LG Wine Smart isn't equipped with high-end cameras. The rear-facing camera offers a resolution of 3.2 MP, the front-facing camera only 0.3 MP. As a result, the photos of the rear-facing camera are small in size. A flash-LED is lacking as well. The color reproduction is pretty decent, but the details suffer thanks to the low resolution.. The picture quality of the front-facing camera is not even sufficient for selfies. One positive aspect: both cameras handle low light pretty well.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. Since the display measures only 3.2-inches, the virtual keyboard is pretty tiny, but typing accurately is still just possible. The input via the physical keys is possible as well with T9 as one of the options. When touching an input field, the virtual keyboard is displayed but remains hidden when navigating with the physical keys. The combination of the two input options takes some getting used to, but it's actually a practical solution.. A few apps make a shortcoming of the touchscreen apparent, as it's a little inaccurate in the corners. Combined with the rather small symbols, the operation can be a little finicky - especially since the "back", "delete" and "end call" keys don't reveal which of these keys might solve the problem.. A 3.2-inch display and a resolution of 480x320 pixels - those stats seem like they are straight from the era of "regular" cell phones and not smartphones. At least the display is quite bright at an average of. 461 cd/m² 445 cd/m² 419 cd/m² 469 cd/m² 442 cd/m² 394 cd/m² 446 cd/m² 451 cd/m² 402 cd/m². 84 % Center on Battery: 442. cd/m²) ΔE Color 9.83 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 11.09 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.2.

It's quite obvious that LG haven't put as much emphasis on the display quality of the Wine Smart as they probably would have had this been a "normal" smartphone. The screen matters much more for smartphones and the display needs to be as high-end as possible to allow for watching videos and looking at photos. For the LG Wine Smart, videos and pictures are almost out of the question anyway, so the black value of. 0.65 cd/mÂ² and the contrast ratio of 680:1 are still acceptable.. spectrophotometer and the CalMAN software reveal a distinctive bluish hue. Colors are not accurate either and pink - to pick one example - looks more like purple.. The flip-feature has the advantage that the user can shield the display against bright light a little bit more easily, so the screen content remains visible. The symbols and text are much smaller, however, which in turn decreases readability. The brightness is sufficient for outdoor use.. The TN LED display is subject to contrast shifts when the display is tilted. The flip-phone design makes this less of an issue as it would be with a regular smartphone..

Even during normal operation, the Wine Smart stutters and lags frequently, which doesn't bode well for performance enthusiasts. The phone is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 MSM8909. - a quad-core SoC running at up to 1.1 GHz - as well as an Adreno 304. GPU and 1024 MB of RAM.. Equipped with the above hardware, the phone is slower than comparable devices as far as the overall CPU and system performance, as well as the speed of the 4 GB of flash storage in particular, are concerned. The LG Wine Smart can handle simple tasks fairly well and even surfing the web is reasonably fast, but that's as much as one should expect.. AnTuTu v5 - Total Score (sort by value) LG Wine Smart.

Simple games like Angry Birds: Star Wars can be played without major caveats and the control via the touchscreen works well, but of course the screen size is quite small. The fact that the keypad-portion sticks out to either the right or left takes some getting used to, as it hinders access to the touchscreen.. More demanding games already approach the limits of the flash storage. Asphalt 8: Airborne , to name an example, needs 1.54 GB of space by itself and can't be installed at all with what's left over after the OS installation. In addition, larger downloads take a very long time.. Angry Birds: Star Wars runs without major problems.. Larger apps often can't be installed at all..

Even under load, the phone doesn't behave out of the ordinary as far as the temperatures are concerned. We measured 36.7 Â°C in the upper area of the physical keys, which is noticeable, but no reason for concern. Given the weak SoC, this was to be expected.

The speaker is located on the back and gets surprisingly loud. Quality-wise, the speaker is suitable for a quick Internet video. We wouldn't recommend listing to songs for extended periods of time, since the bass is lacking and the highs are over-emphasized. The fact that the LG Wine Smart emits sounds all the time is annoying - for example, when opening or closing the display portion. Fortunately, this can be turned off.. The LG Wine Smart doesn't draw a lot of power, which can be attributed at least in part to the small display. On average, the phone consumes a third to one-half of what comparable smartphones need. That alone should guarantee long runtimes - or shouldn't it?. Off / Standby 0 / 0.1 Watt Idle 0.4 / 0.9 / 1.4 Watt. Unfortunately, the battery only offers a capacity of 6.5 Wh; the Wiko Rainbow Up. for example is equipped with a 10.3 Wh power source. While the LG Wine Smart can keep up with other smartphones as far as runtimes are concerned, it does require recharging after about one-and-a-half days. On the other hand, users probably won't use the Wine Smart much to surf the web, which in turn should increase the battery life. All things considered, the battery life is certainly acceptable, but we would've expected a little more here because of the small display.. Idle (without WLAN, min brightness) 17h.

The LG Wine Smart is targeted towards a particular user group and should interest those who like retro-designs and lament the disappearance of flip phones but still would like a modern OS, LTE and various apps. But even though all these criteria are met, there aren't any real advantages compared to a regular smartphone: the battery life isn't any better, the performance just average and navigating and browsing can be a chore because of the tiny display.. The combination of touchscreen and physical keys has its advantages, although the operation can get confusing at times. Even though we like the case with the swappable battery, the display section simply isn't rigid enough. The cameras are another weak point, as comparably-priced smartphones often offer much better quality and more possibilities.. For a price of 160 Euros (~$175), LG sells a piece of nostalgia taking us back to a time when phones like the Motorola Razr, Samsung's flip phone and the Nokia 7220 were state-of-the-art. Unfortunately, the LG Wine Smart requires a willingness to compromise and even then, it doesn't have a lot of advantages compared to a normal smartphone. We can only recommend it for those who are true flip-phone fanatics or users who simply want a phone to make calls. Even so, there are cheaper alternatives..

Ended up in the IT sector in the 90s more or less accidentally and have remained in the industry (as a sysadmin) ever since. Always been interested in laptops - first purchase was - if memory serves correctly - a Toshiba Satellite T2115CS with DX4-75 processor, 4 MB of RAM and 350 MB hard disk drive (and Windows 3.1). To this day, laptops appeal to me - much to the chagrin of my wife, who doesnât seem understand why we need 5-10 of them at any given time ;-)..

Originally announced in the domestic Korean market as LG Gentle, the all-new LG Wine Smart will make its international debut later this month in target countries including France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Kazakhstan and Japan, among others..

The new LG Wine Smart is powered by Android Lollipop 5.1.1 to run the latest apps without complaint.

LG's Lollipop-powered flip phone goes global as the Wine Smart. Late last month, LG announced the Gentle , a flip phone running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. The manufacturer is known to launch several clamshell phones in its home market, with the handsets usually restricted to South Korea. That's changed with the Gentle, as LG is now stating that it will make the Gentle — which will be branded the LG Wine Smart — available in select markets around the world later this month, starting with France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Kazakhstan, Japan and the United Kingdom.. LG mentions that the Wine Smart is designed for a "generation of users who are more accustomed to the feel of flip phones." The phone features a 3.2-inch display with a resolution of 480 x 320, quad-core 1.1 GHz Snapdragon 210 CPU, 1GB RAM, 4GB internal memory, microSD slot, 3MP camera at the back, front VGA shooter and a 1,700mAh battery. The handset also offers LTE connectivity, although there isn't a mention of the specific bands supported. On the software front, the Wine Smart runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box.. Pricing wasn't announced, but the Gentle retails for the equivalent of $170 in South Korea, so it is likely LG will be targeting the sub-$200 segment with the Wine Smart in international markets. Would you be interested in getting one?. NEW LG WINE SMART DELIVERS SMARTPHONE FEATURES WITH FAMILIAR FOLDER STYLE CONVENIENCE.

Press enter or click on the search icon. The flip phone is back with the LG Wine Smart. LG has announced a new phone that evokes memories of a pre-iPhone era, the LG Wine Smart.. Remember when flip phones were cool? If you’re struggling to remember, it was in the days before phones got smart, back in the early to mid-noughties. Phones like those of the popular Motorola Razr range.. Some nations continue to lap up such flip phones, but the form is all but defunct in the West.. However, LG has just announced a new flip phone to an international audience. The LG Wine Smart (which was previously launched as the LG Gentle in South Korea) combines modern smartphone features with a decade-old clamshell aesthetic.. This is a decidedly entry-level phone, however. It’s got a 3.2 inch 480 x 320 touch-sensitive display on one internal surface, and a physical T9 keyboard in the other.. Internally, the Wine Smart is powered by a 1.1 GHz quad-core CPU and 1GB of RAM. There’s a mere 4GB of internal storage, backed by a microSD slot. It also has a 3.2-megapixel camera.. These are lower than low-end specs for a new mid-2015 device. Yet the LG Wine Smart still runs on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, and it still has 4G LTE network connectivity.. All in all, the LG Wine Smart is a curious blend of old and new, and you might wonder who it’s meant for. LG says that the Wine Smart is “designed especially for a generation of users who are more accustomed to the feel of flip,” but we’d suggest it’s not a generational thing at all. Read More: Best cheap phones The Wine Smart seems to be intended for those hold-outs still stubbornly using their old clamshell feature phones. Those who have never made the switch to one of these newfangled smartphones with their unnatural hingeless designs.. We’re expecting to see the LG Wine Smart retail for an extremely wallet-friendly price when it launches later in August. LG is releasing the phone across a disparate spread of “target countries,” including France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Kazakhstan and Japan.. Take a look at our hands-on with what could be the best cheap smartphone yet in the following video:. Trusted Reviews is part of the Time Inc. Trusted Reviews is part of the Time Inc. 
Esto también se puede leer en español.. LG thinks yesteryear with its new Wine Smart handset. New Android smartphone sports a clamshell design and physical alphanumeric keyboard.. August 4, 2015 8:47 PM PDT. The LG Wine Smart has a clam-shell design but runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. The LG Wine Smart, an Android-powered smartphone that plays on nostalgia with its clamshell body, is ready to make its international debut.. Sporting a physical alphanumeric keyboard like those commonly found on cell phones not too long ago, the handset is designed to appeal to users who still want the smartphone experience without the all-encompassing touchscreen. After flipping open the handset, users will discover Android 5.1.1 Lollipop running on its 3.5-inch touchscreen.. "Our goal with LG Wine Smart was to create a smartphone that fans of flip phones could embrace," Chris Yie, vice president and head of marketing communications LG Mobile Communications, said in a statement. "Consumers shouldn't have to miss out on the smartphone revolution because they prefer a particular phone design over another.". The LG Wine Smart is LG's latest effort to stay competitive in a fierce smartphone landscape. Research firm TrendForce reported last month that LG is the fifth-largest smartphone maker in the world with 5.8 percent market share. According to LG, its devices have grown in popularity in North America, where sales were up 36 percent year over year. In its home country, LG's mobile sales fell by 29 percent year over year on weaker demand.. Powered by a 1.1GHz quad-core processor and 3-megapixel rear-facing camera, the current Wine Smart is an updated version of the model introduced in Korea last year. The new version, branded as the LG Gentle in the handset maker's home market, will be available in blue and burgundy colors later this month in France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Kazakhstan, Japan and the United Kingdom..

LG makes its Wine Smart flip smartphone official in Korea. LGs teaser of its Wine Smart device last week caught more than a few people by surprise, as clamshell phones have long since gone the way of the dinosaur with the emergence of smartphones. The Wine Smart is apparently the companys attempt to combine the two, and its official announcement of the Wine Smart for Korea this week confirms that the device will run Android KitKat.. It will, however, apparently be targeted at specifically at elderly or handicapped users, and its unlikely to make its way outside of the Korean market.. Specs-wise, the markedly entry-level device features a quad-core 1.2GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and a 320 x 480px display at 3.5-inches. Itll have 4GB of internal storage and its 1,700mAh battery will be removable.. The LG Wine Smart will be hitting the Korean market in White and Black on September 26.. Source (Korean) | Via.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ hands-on: The devil is in the details. LG's Wine Smart is an Android flip phone for the messaging elderly. Friends ("The One Where the Monkey Gets Away") is on TV, Alanis Morissette is angrily screaming "You oughta know" on the radio, your bff messages you on WhatsApp. What's the misfit in this picture? Nothing if you're rocking LG's Wine Smart -- a rare smartphone flip phone. Nostalgia from the 90s (or, really, 2007 ) aside, the Wine Smart isn't all that unusual. Flip phones are still popular in certain markets, and why wouldn't you want one with the latest version of Android, a 1.2GHz processor, 8-megapixel camera and expandable memory? Well, that's exactly what the Wine smart has, although if you were hoping LG's 2K display might filter down from the G3 , you'd be fresh outta luck (3.5-inch, 480 x 320 is what you'll have to settle for). The inclusion of a "safe keeper" function that alerts friends or family if you fall suggest this is pitched at an older crowd. But, then there's a dedicated button for a instant messaging app, too. We're sure LG knows its market though, so who are we to question? Oh, there's an FM radio too. Perfect for that Morissette revival, whenever and wherever LG decides to release it.. android , clamshell , flip phone , lg , lg wine smart , mobilepostcross , wine smart.

Tech deals, prizes and latest news. 2000 called, it wants its clamshells back. Back in time The best retro phone videos. No, you haven't travelled back in time. It's 2015 and LG has just launched a clamshell phone in the form of the LG Wine Smart.. Announced in Korea under the moniker LG Gentle earlier this year, the Wine Smart is making its way out of LG's homeland and landing in countries including France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Japan and the UK.. So apart from a design which will leave you yearning for our simpler mobile past, what else do you get? There's a 3.2-inch, 480 x 320 touchscreen, 1.1GHz quad-core processor, 1GB of RAM, a measly 4GB of internal storage and a microSD slot.. Of course, with a screen that small you'll be unlikely to download many apps or games - even though the LG Wine Smart is running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop - so the internal storage shouldn't cause too many issues.. The small internal storage is joined by a couple of cameras which could easily be plucked from a phone eight years ago with a VGA front snapper and 3MP rear offering.. It's a chunky monkey too, with the Wine Smart set to make a sizeable bulge in your pocket thanks to its 16.6mm depth.. The specs aren't really a deal breaker though, as you'll be buying the phone for its clamshell flip action. It's not as powerful as a Samsung Galaxy S6 or iPhone 6 , but it'll likely turn more heads down the pub.. Exact details surrounding the LG Wine Smart release date and price are yet to be announced..

Jaime Rivera March 18, 2015 1:44 am. We’ve spent the last couple of years drooling over the idea of new smartphone form factors. Lately every single device we see is a just a typical flat slab, and even though some of these have gained some curves over time, it simply can’t replace the era of experimentation that we saw before the birth of the first-generation iPhone.. Even so, back when slide-out QWERTY keyboards were common, we rarely ever saw companies experiment with the old flip-phone design that became so popular in the early turn of the century. Palm did give it a try at some point, but we’ve wished to see this come to Android for the longest time. After some trial and error by other OEMs, LG decided to give this form factor a try late last year, and it was just impossible for us to not be geeks about it at MWC 2015. Make sure you watch our hands-on video of the LG Wine Smart and the LG Ice Cream Smart as part of our late coverage of the world’s biggest mobile trade show..

By Pavithra Rathinavel On 08/06/15 AT 1:56 AM. Here is a list of configuration details pertaining to the upcoming wallet-friendly smartphone dubbed LG H740. LG released its flagship smartphone, the G4, in April 2015. The response to the handset has been rather lackluster and it clearly showed in the quarterly results of the company. However, LG is now concentrating on the mid-range segment. Sleek body and big display-clad smartphones aside, flip phones (or clamshells) are reportedly making a comeback. The new “LG Wine Smart,” which is the Android flip phone sold in Korea as “LG Gentle,” will apparently be making an international debut.. Initial reports stated that the LG Wine Smart or LG Gentle would. be exclusive to home country Korea. The South Korean tech giant has changed the plan and hence, this flip phone will be released in selected international markets. This includes France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Kazakhstan, Japan and the UK, according to GSM Arena .. There is no difference in the configuration between the Korean version and the international LG Wine Smart. This flip phone runs on the latest Android 5.1.1 Lollipop OS, straight out of the box.. comes with a 3.2-inch IPS LCD display, packed with HVGA (320 x 480 pixels) screen resolution. The device comes powered by a quad-core processor, clocked at 1.1 GHz and backed by 1 GB of RAM configuration.. However, the native storage space is a pain point as the LG Wine Smart comes equipped with only 4 GB of native memory. But there is a microSD card slot for further expansion. The device sports a modest 3.15 MP rear-facing camera.. Meanwhile, the LG Wine Smart measures 117.7 x 58.7 x 16.6 mm and weighs 143 g. Apart from the standard connectivity options, the handset also supports 4G LTE. Furthermore, the entire configuration is held together and powered by a Li-Ion 1,700 mAh battery unit.

The Flip phone IS coming back! LG reveals it will sell budget 90s-style mobile with a small screen and 3MP camera in US and UK. The LG Wine Smart will be sold in South Korea for around £109 ($170) Handset has a 90s design, chunky physical buttons and 3MP camera. Modern features include a fast processor, touch screen and Android 5.1. Flip phones were all the rage in the 1990s - they were the ultimate fashion accessory, with the likes of Alicia Silverstone sporting one in Clueless.. But you could soon be answering a call with the flick of your wrist again, because LG has launched a new model with a handful of modern feature - and says it will launch in the US and UK soon.. Called the LG Wine Smart, the handset has a 3.2-inch colour touch screen and runs Android Lollipop 5.1, as well as enabling 4G calls...but it does have a more old fashioned camera.. LG has launched a new flip phone called the LG Wine Smart (pictured), which has a. 3.2-inch colour screen and runs Android Lollipop 5.1, as well as. Size: 11.7 x 5.9 x 1.7cm. Chip: 1.1GHz quad core processor. Storage: 4GB with a Micro SD slot. Price: 200,000Won (£109 or $170). The phone has launched in Korea,and is set to come next to starting with France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Kazakhstan, Japan and the United Kingdom.. With a circular navigation button in the centre of the physical keypad, the handset bears a striking resemblance to the more basic handsets many of us cherished over a decade ago, such as the Motorola Razr.. 'Our goal with LG Wine Smart was to create a smartphone that fans of flip phones could embrace,' said Chris Yie, vice president and head of marketing communications for LG.. 'Consumers shouldn't have to miss out on the smartphone revolution because they prefer a particular phone design over another.. 'With LG Wine Smart, they won't have to.'. However, the 3.2-inch screen - which is small compared to today's 5.5-inch phablet screens – is a touchscreen and the central Q button displays a user's most frequently used apps when pressed.. The flip phone is powered by a modern, powerful 1.1GHz quad-core Snapdragon 2010 processor and has 1GB of RAM.. There is 4GB of internal storage and this can be upgraded with a microSD slot..

Deadly frogs use their heads as SPEARS: Tropical amphibians.... It has a 1700mAh battery and supports 4G LTE, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and GPS, meaning the budget handset can perform many more tricks than flip phones from the 90s.. The Gentle has a soft leather case, which comes in three colours, covering the chunky buttons inside.. But it's not only the design that's nostalgic.. Flip phones were all the rage in the 1990s, as seen in the film Clueless for example (pictured). With a circular navigation button in the centre of the physical keypad, the handset bears some resemblance to the more basic handsets many of us cherished over a decade ago, such as the Motorola Razr (shown). The handset has a three megapixel camera and 0.3 megapixel camera on the front for decidedly blurry selfies.. By comparison, the best cameras packed into new flagship devices are around 21 megapixels.. Flip phones remain popular in Asia and this one is LG's third.. The company says clamshell designs are a hit with people who like instant messaging apps and with elderly users, because they can be gripped easily and have large physical keypads so it's easy to type messages.. The budget handset will be available in South Korea for 200,000Won (£109 or $170).. The price point pits it against Motorola's Moto G handset laucnh earlier this week, which has comparably better features, including 8GB of internal storage, a waterproof case and 13 megapixel camera..

more ... more .... more ... more .... LG's new Wine Smart is an Android Lollipop flip phone made for international markets. LG's new Wine Smart is an Android Lollipop flip phone made for international markets. posted by Florin T.. Tags :. LG - LG + Android - Android +. LG today announced that it's going to release an Android -based flip phone (aka clamshell) in various markets around the world. Called Wine Smart, the handset is a rebranded LG Gentle - a device that LG introduced last month in its home country. We all know that the golden days of flip phones are long gone, so why is LG bothering to launch such a device around the world? Well, the company says that the Wine Smart is simply a handset for nostalgic users: those "who are more accustomed to the feel of flip phones." Running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, the LG Wine Smart is powered by a quad-core 1.1 GHz Snapdragon 210 processor, and offers a small 3.2-inch display with just 320 x 420 pixels, alongside a traditional numeric keypad with four hotkeys. The smartphone further features a 3 MP rear camera, VGA front-facing camera, 1 GB of RAM, 4 GB of expandable storage space, and a 1700 mAh battery. Surprisingly, it's also got LTE connectivity. According to LG, the Wine Smart will make its international debut later in August. The first countries to get the phone will be the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Poland, Kazakhstan, and Japan. Right now, we don't know if the device will be available in North America. Interestingly, this new handset has exactly the same name as an Android flip phone that LG launched last year in Korea. The price of the LG Wine Smart hasn't been announced, but we know that, in South Korea, the LG Gentle is sold for around $170. Would you buy the handset for that kind of money?.

If it was aluminum instead of plastic with a slightly better processor (400 range) and a 720 screen, and reasonable cameras (5 megapixel back, 2 megapixel front) with a qwerty keyboard instead of just numeric (all of which is very doable), they'd really have an intriguing product on their hands.
