Xiaomi Mi A1 review: the perfect budget phone?. by Abhishek Baxi November 3, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Great build quality and premium design. The Android One pitch is passable, but the Xiaomi Mi A1 is a very capable device on its own and comes very close to being the perfect smartphone for those on a budget.. Expandable up to 128 GB with microSD card. Rear Camera Dual 12 MP (26mm, f/2.2; 50mm, f/2.6). Dimensions 155.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm. Introduced in 2014, Googleâs Android One program never quite took off the way the company had envisioned. The program focused on developing markets like India and aimed to deliver budget smartphones with a stock Android experience powered by Google. A series of disappointing devices from domestic OEMs, partly thanks to stringent requirements from Google, didnât manage to make a dent in the market. But Android One wasn’t out for the count.. In collaboration with Xiaomi, Google has just rebooted the Android One program, which has since had the Moto X4 and HTC U11 Life added to the mix. It is clear the program is not just about entry-level smartphones anymore. The mid-range Xiaomi Mi A1 is pitched as a product thatâs âcreated by Xiaomi and powered by Google.â. That means Xiaomi is shunning its proprietary Android skin MIUI in favor of stock Android for the first time. Having spent a few weeks with the device, hereâs my comprehensive Xiaomi MI A1 review.. For this review, I used the Indian variant of the Mi A1. My colleague, Bailey Stein, had the international variant and he used that for the accompanying video review. The reviews â text and video â reflect both of our opinions of the device.. The Mi A1 has design elements in common with other Xiaomi devices, but feels like an elegantly crafted upgrade.. It offers a premium metallic feel and looks solid in construction. At 7.3mm, it is still quite slim. weight feels great in the hand. Although slightly wider, it fits nicely in the palm and has great ergonomics because of its round edges and sleek side profile.. At the back, the dual cameras protrude a bitâ an aberration for Xiaomi devicesâ but itâs neither an eyesore nor a deal breaker. Below the cameras, in the center of the phone, is the Mi A1’s fingerprint reader. We found it to be on par with other devices in this price category.. Overall, the Mi A1 has a striking visual appeal with neat elements, like the nicely crafted speaker grille and the antenna lines at the back. I think that it is one of the best looking Xiaomi devices weâve seen, ignoring the Mi MIX series of course.. I do have to mention that the rear of the Mi A1 is eerily similar to the iPhone 7 Plus. A lot of Chinese brands have followed this model over the past year, so we would have liked to see something more original, but again, it’s not a deal breaker.. The 5.5-inch LTPS IPS display on the Mi A1 makes for a good design choice with 2.5D curved glass at the top. The Full HD display delivers crisp visuals and excellent contrast, with a pixel density of 403 ppi.. While the ample brightness results in good enough sunlight viewing, it is certainly not the best, especially because of the reflective display panel. Also, outdoors in the sun, the colors often appear washed out. Thereâs also no reading mode like on other MIUI-based Xiaomi devices of late.. The display on the Mi A1 is vivid and bright. Its graphics look great and its text is sharp. The color reproduction could be more accurate, but most users won’t notice unless they have it side-by-side with a better panel.. With the Mi A1, Xiaomi goes back to its trusted octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, which also powers the Redmi Note 4 and Mi Max 2 .. While some expected Xiaomi to go up the value chain and opt for the newer Snapdragon 630 or 660 SoC, or last year’s Snapdragon 626, the 625 is still a fair choice. For a mid-tier chipset, it offers a good balance of performance and efficiency, and keeps the pricing in check.. Clocked at 2 GHz and coupled with 4 GB of RAM, the Snapdragon 625 keeps the Mi A1 snappy and able to handle anything thrown at it in everyday usage. It is also powerful enough to handle most graphics-intensive games. The stock Android experience is definitely lighter on resources than MIUI, so you’ll enjoy a snappier experience overall than on the Redmi Note 4.. Xiaomi claims it uses dual pyrolytic graphite sheets to dissipate heat effectively, but the results are a mixed bag. While I didnât face any problem during long gaming sessions, the phone can get a bit hot while charging or while using Google Maps for navigation during a long commute. We should not that this is not entirely abnormal, but certainly something to keep in mind.. The Mi A1 packs in 64 GB of internal storage which should be enough for most people, though there is a microSD card slot so you can expand its capacity up to another 128 GB. You will have to give up one of the two nano SIM card slots to do so, however. A lot of people who use only one SIM or are content with 64 GB of storage wonât mind this, but thereâs a vocal group of users who will hate the lack of flexibility.. The Mi A1 also sports an infrared emitter that works flawlessly with a variety of home appliances via the Mi Remote app. We always enjoy seeing this feature, as it has become quite rare in recent years.. Audio output through the single bottom-firing speaker is pretty good. The sound is loud, albeit slightly distorted. Overall, it’s about average for this price.. The Redmi Note 4 boasted an exceptional 4,000 mAh battery, but Xiaomi has kept the capacity modest with the Mi A at 3,080 mAh. Battery life was still very good in our testing, although not far above average. Standby times were especially impressive, possibly thanks to the various optimizations in stock Android.. Note that the battery life screenshots above represent Bailey’s experience while using the Mi A1 on a 3G network in the United States. We expect that actual battery life while using the device on a proper 4G network will be less impressive.. The Xiaomi Mi A1 also supports Qualcommâs Quick Charge technology, and the bundled 2A charger replenishes the device from zero to 100% in less than two hours, which is good but not incredible.. The Xiaomi Mi A1 brings a dual camera setup to a mid-range smartphone. Itâs not the first brand to do this, but it is the first one to offer 2x lossless optical zoom in its segment.. The camera setup includes a 12 MP wide-angle 26mm f/2.2 lens and another 12 MP 50mm f/2.6 telephoto lens, with a dual-tone LED flash.. In ideal lighting conditions, the camera on the Mi A1 manages to take some really good portrait shots with natural looking colors. Most shots had clearly defined edges and just the right blurring. In a few cases, it overdid the blurring, though. The landscape shots were also impressive and offered accurate color reproduction and good sharpness.. In low light conditions, photos lack detail and excessive noise creeps in. Unlike in daylight, these shots didnât capture color well. The portrait mode is almost useless in low-light conditions, too. The lack of optical image stabilization is evident. Photos taken with the flash came out better, although I donât usually prefer to take photos that way.. While the Mi A1 does have phase detection auto-focus (PDAF), it sometimes takes a moment before locking on to the subject. When it does, it is usually accurate even in difficult lighting conditions.. The 5 MP front camera takes quite good selfies and with face detection it locks on to your face in a snap. The details are fairly impressive in good lighting conditions, though it cannot be compared to some other smartphones in the market with a special focus on front camera optics.. Xiaomi claims that its portrait mode can match the performance of the iPhone 7 Plus and OnePlus 5 , but thatâs a stretch. For its price it is impressive and it nails depth-of-field shots. If you do well, youâd be able to manage some incredible portraits and bokeh shots from the Mi A1. Overall, apart from underwhelming low-light performance, the results on the dual cameras on the Mi A1 won’t disappoint you.. While the Mi A1 runs stock Android, Xiaomi offers its own Camera app. The minimal app offers intuitive controls and includes modes like Panorama, Manual, Beautify, Group selfies, Square, et al. When in depth mode, the Camera app guides you in shooting portraits suggesting appropriate distance and lighting which is quite handy for new or amateur users.. The Mi A1 runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat in its unadulterated form. There are no add-ons or customizations, and Xiaomi only bundles three of its apps – Feedback, Mi Remote, and Mi Store. The camera app too is Xiaomiâs because the stock Android app does not support dual cameras yet.. You get all the goodness of stock Android Nougat, along with the assurance of regular security patches and an Android Oreo update before the end of the year. At the launch event in New Delhi, it was also announced that the Mi A1 will get Android P as and when itâs released.. That said, thereâs nothing else an Android One device brings to the table compared to other devices from Nokia or Lenovo that offer a stock Android experience. Google offers unlimited high-quality storage for photos and videos on Google Photos, but not in original quality, which is pretty disappointing – that’s a Pixel exclusive.. At first, it was slightly disorienting to use a Xiaomi device without MIUI. The customization layer has been an integral part of the companyâs devices. To its credit, Xiaomi has earned a lot of fans by working hard to bake in nifty add-ons and useful features to MIUI. In the end, it boils down to individual preference between two good approaches to the Android experience.. Iâm not sure if Google contributes anything significant to this collaboration, but Xiaomi puts up a good showcase of its prowess.. The Xiaomi Mi A1 is a pretty solid and well-rounded package. The capable innards are housed in a premium metallic chassis that looks great. In the daylight the dual cameras shine, and its portraits alone merit a much higher price.. It’s difficult to criticize the Mi A1 given its impressive affordability, but we would have liked to see a more original design and better low-light camera performance nonetheless.. Android One or not, the Mi A1 is a very capable device. Getting a stock Android experience with guaranteed updates, which essentially future-proofs device, just sweetens the deal. Iâm not sure if Google contributes anything significant to this collaboration, but Xiaomi puts up a good showcase of its prowess. At â¹14,999 ($230) in India, the Mi A1 is close to the perfect smartphone for those on a budget.. Xiaomi Android One Xiaomi Mi A1. Android One , Xiaomi , Xiaomi Mi A1.

Xiaomi Mi A1 review: Best of both worlds. The Mi A1 is Xiaomi's best budget phone yet.. Of the hundreds of phones sold in the budget segment every year, a mere handful of devices stand out: the Moto G series, for instance, along with the likes of Xiaomi's Redmi Note phones, Lenovo's K series, and Honor's budget devices.. In 2017, that list is dominated by Xiaomi's phones. The Redmi Note 4 continues to be one of the best devices in the sub-₹15,000 segment seven months after its launch, and the Redmi 4 and Redmi 4A offer excellent bang for your buck in the sub-₹10,000 tier. Then there's the Mi Max 2 , which for ₹16,999 offers a large 6.44-inch display backed by a gorgeous aluminum unibody design.. Xiaomi's aggressive positioning in the budget segment allowed the brand to catapult up the rankings, with the manufacturer now the second-largest phone vendor in India. The Redmi Note 4 and Redmi 4 are two of the best-selling phones in the country this year, and with its latest phone, Xiaomi is set to consolidate its position in this category.. The Mi A1 is a great phone in its own right, but Xiaomi's decision to partner with Google to deliver stock Android makes it a much more compelling option. A small but vocal minority of Xiaomi fans have been clamoring for a device with clean Android for some time now, and with the Mi A1, the brand has delivered just that.. Read on to find out why the Mi A1 is the best budget phone you can currently buy in India.. I (Harish Jonnalagadda) am writing this review after using the Mi A1 for two weeks in Hyderabad, India on Airtel's 4G network. The phone runs Android 7.1.2 Nougat out of the box along with the August 1, 2017 security patch. The unit was provided to Android Central for review by Xiaomi India.. 5.5-inch IPS LCD 1920 x 1080 (403ppi) Gorilla Glass, 2.5D curved glass. Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 2.0GHz octa-core Cortex A53 14nm FinFET. 12MP wide-angle (OmniVision OV12A10) f/2.2, 1.25-micron pixels Dual tone flash, PDAF 4K@30FPS. 12MP telephoto (OmniVision OV13880) f/2.6, 1.1-micron pixels. Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 4.2 IR blaster, 3.5mm jack GPS/AGPS, GLONASS, BeiDou. One-touch fingerprint sensor at the back. 155.4 x 75.8 x 7.3mm 165g. The Mi A1 is a rebranded variant of the Mi 5X, which sports an all-metal chassis with antenna lines at the top and bottom. There's a clear difference in the design language between the Redmi series and phones in the Mi lineup, with the latter featuring a more refined aesthetic. As a result, the Mi A1 makes recent devices like the Redmi Note 4 look outdated.. The clean lines combined with the aluminum chassis gives the Mi A1 a premium look, and the build quality is outstanding. The phone comes with a 3.5mm jack, and unlike the Redmi Note 4, there's a USB-C charging port at the bottom. The power and volume buttons at the back provide a decent amount of tactile feedback, and there's an IR blaster located up top.. The back of the device is where things get interesting, with the Mi A1 sporting a dual camera setup. The configuration is the same as that of the Mi 6 — a primary sensor augmented by a secondary telephoto lens — but Xiaomi is using different imaging sensors.. The positioning of the dual camera to the top left corner coupled with Xiaomi's decision to tuck the antenna bands at the top and bottom of the device means the Mi A1 has more than a passing resemblance to the OnePlus 5. There is a Mi logo and Android One signage at the bottom of the phone to inform the world that it isn't in fact a OnePlus 5, and the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor also makes that abundantly clear.. The Mi A1 is Xiaomi's best-looking phone in the budget segment thus far.. The fingerprint sensor is conveniently located such that your finger automatically rests on it, and it had no issues authenticating my fingerprints.. Switching over to the front, the first thing you notice is the bezels at the top and bottom, and if you're picking up the gold color option, you'll get a white front plate. The side bezels are narrow, which makes it easier to hold the phone, and the back button is in the wrong position for a phone running stock Android.. Xiaomi has a long history of offering decent LCD panels in its phones, and the situation is no different with the Mi A1. The 5.5-inch Full HD screen is one of the best in this segment, with excellent colors and viewing angles. The panel gets sufficiently bright that it isn't an issue to view the contents on the screen under harsh sunlight.. Coming over to the hardware side of things, the Snapdragon 625 paired with stock Android makes the Mi A1 absolutely fly. You're not going to notice any slowdowns or lags in everyday usage. It's astonishing just how fluid the phone is at day-to-day tasks, whether it's switching between apps, quickly launching the camera, or playing visually intensive games.. Battery life on the Mi A1 is excellent. I was initially worried that the 3080mAh battery wouldn't last a day, but I consistently got a day and a half's worth of usage out of the battery.. Even on days when I was on cellular data throughout, I managed to get up to four hours of screen-on-time and overall battery life exceeding 20 hours. To put that into context, that's nearly double what I averaged on the Pixel XL in similar conditions.. The one downside is the lack of a fast charging option. The Mi A1 tops out at 5V/2A, and it takes nearly two hours to fully charge the phone.. The software is what sets the Mi A1 apart from every other Xiaomi phone in the market today. The Chinese manufacturer teamed up with Google to offer the Mi A1 as a part of the Android One initiative, which means that for the first time, we're getting to see a Xiaomi phone with stock Android.. Google's first attempt with Android One failed miserably due to a combination of several factors. The phones were underwhelming and didn't stand out in the entry-level segment where they were positioned, and Google didn't do enough to advertize them to the masses. By partnering with Xiaomi, it is addressing those setbacks: the Mi A1 is one of the best-looking phones in the budget segment, and Xiaomi utterly dominates the mind share in markets like India, which ensures the phone gets plenty of visibility.. The software experience on the Mi A1 is on par with the Pixels and Nexus devices.. As for the software experience itself, it is in line with what you'd get on a Pixel or Nexus device. There's a swipe up gesture to access the app drawer, Google Now occupies the left-most pane, and all interface elements are unchanged from stock Android.. The phone runs Android 7.1.2 Nougat out of the box, and has the August 1, 2017 security patch. You get all the features built into Nougat, including split-screen multitasking, in-line notification replies, app shortcuts, granular controls for Do Not Disturb, and more. Then there's the ability to pull down the notification shade by swiping down on the fingerprint sensor, à la Pixel. There's also a gesture to quickly launch the camera by double pressing the power button.. Overall, it's a refreshing change to use a Xiaomi phone with stock Android. MIUI certainly has a lot to offer, but purists looking for an uncluttered experience finally have a device they can call their own.. The only unknown when it comes to the software side of things is the update situation. Previous Android One devices have received updates directly from Google, but that will not be the case with the Mi A1. As the phone features a dual camera setup, Xiaomi has bundled its own Mi camera app instead of Google Camera. Xiaomi also pre-installed the Mi Remote app, which lets you use the IR blaster to control your TV, air con, or set-top box.. As a result of these additions, Xiaomi will be in charge of software updates for the Mi A1. The brand is committing to quick updates, and Google has stated that the phone will receive Oreo before the end of the year. Furthermore, the Mi A1 will be one of the first devices to pick up the Android P update next year.. The Mi A1 has two 12MP cameras at the back: the first is a wide-angle lens with 1.25-micron pixels and f/2.2, and the latter is a telephoto f/2.6 lens with 1.1-micron pixels that offers 2x optical zoom. The tagline for the Mi A1 is, "Flagship dual camera," with Xiaomi alluding to the fact that the phone has the same camera configuration as the Mi 6.. Although Xiaomi is using different imaging sensors, the image quality you get with the Mi A1 is on par with that of the Mi 6, at least in daylight conditions.. Mi 6 on the left, Mi A1 to the right.. The Mi A1 managed to hold its own next to the Mi 6, and the phone outdid its costlier sibling in a few scenarios. That said, the Mi 6 is currently on a beta MIUI build whereas the Mi A1 is running a stable version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat.. The camera app itself should be immediately familiar if you've used a Xiaomi phone in the past. You get toggles for filters and easy access to various shooting modes, which include panorama, tilt shift, a square mode for Instagram, and others. There's also a toggle for enabling the watermark, with resulting images featuring a "Shot on Mi A1" watermark in the bottom left corner.. Other options include the ability to switch between the primary imaging sensor and the telephoto lens via the 2x button, toggles for HDR, flash, portrait mode, switching between photo and video modes and the front and rear cameras. And yes, it still tries to guess your gender and age when you're taking selfies.. Portrait Mode works in a similar fashion to what we've seen on the Mi 6, with the camera blurring out the background to put the subject in focus. The mode needs plenty of lighting to work, and while the camera does a decent job in terms of blurring the background, it has a tough time delineating the edges.. Photos shot in daylight have plenty of detail, but those taken in low-light conditions tend to be very noisy. The 5MP front shooter is similarly decent for taking selfies. The camera on the Mi A1 isn't groundbreaking, but it is plenty capable considering the price point the device is targeting.. Xiaomi Mi A1 Bottom line. Should you buy it? Without a doubt. Xiaomi seems particularly intent on building out market share, and to that effect the brand has priced the Mi A1 very aggressively. The ₹14,999 price is astounding when you consider what's on offer with the device: sleek design, great display, clean software experience, dual cameras, and all-day battery life.. The software experience in particular is the standout feature of the Mi A1. One of the main reasons for Motorola's success in this segment was because of its reliance on an uncluttered user interface, and by teaming up with Google, Xiaomi is able to offer a similar experience to its customers.. The Mi A1 is the most uncompromising phone in the budget segment today. We've seen some great devices debuting in the market this year, notably the Redmi Note 4 and the Moto G5 Plus , and as an overall package, the Mi A1 handily beats both devices. For ₹14,999 you'll be hard-pressed to find a phone that offers quite as much for your money.. Xiaomi is once again leveraging its flash sales model for the Mi A1, which means that you won't be able to go to Mi.com and purchase the device whenever you want. The sale kicks off every Tuesday at 12 p.m., but if you don't want to wait, you always have the option of going to a Mi Home store and purchasing the device. Xiaomi is also making the phone available at over 600 partner stores.. It isn't the easiest process to get a hold of the Mi A1, but the device itself is well worth it..

The Xiaomi Mi A1 is a re-branded Xiaomi Mi 5X phone, co-developed by Google —as part of its Android One initiative—and Xiaomi that runs on the Android operating system. Mi A1 comes with a 5.5" touchscreen display with Full HD 1080p resolution, powered by a 3080 mAh battery. It measures 155.40 x 75.80 x 7.30 (height x width x thickness) and weighs 168.00 grams. The phone is powered by an 2.0 GHz Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor with Adreno 506 GPU and comes with 4GB of RAM. It has an internal storage of 32/64GB and unique for the series, microSD card slot supporting up to 128 GB cards. The rear camera on the Mi A1 is 12 + 12 megapixel shooter with auto focus and 2x optical lossless zoom, it is capable of recording 4K videos, the phone also has a 5 megapixel front camera. Sensors on the phone include compass magnetometer , proximity sensor , accelerometer , ambient light sensor and gyroscope , fingerprint sensor [5]. The Xiaomi Mi A1 ships with Android 7.1.2 Nougat. Besides Google software, the phone comes with Xiaomi's applications such as Camera, FeedBack, Mi Community and Mi Remote. Mi A1 users get access to free unlimited storage on Google Photos and the phone will receive two years of minimum OS upgrades with confirmed upgrades to Android Oreo and Android P. [6] The update does not bring a full Android Oreo experience as it lacks project Treble for device independent system updates. They had not released the kernel in the first three months of release. [7] The kernel was released in January 2018. The Xiaomi Mi A1 was unveiled on September 5, 2017 and it is available in all of Xiaomi's current markets [10] , with the exception of the People's Republic of China , where Mi 5X MIUI based variant of the phone was released prior that year.. Xiaomi Mi A1 received mostly positive reviews. Sam Byford of The Verge described Mi A1's most distinct feature is its software that runs on stock Android and not on Xiaomi's MIUI layer. [12] Sahil Gupta of TechRadar wrote that Mi A1’s Android One certified experience along with tried and tested hardware, and dual camera capability gives you the premium feel under a budget. The Android Oreo update produces a drastic battery drain on the phone.

Ketan Pratap , 08 September 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Xiaomi Mi A1 has been launched at Rs. Gadgets 360 rates the phone 8 out of 10. Xiaomi on Tuesday took the wraps off its all-new Mi A1 Android One smartphone which represents a reboot of Google's Android One project. The Chinese company started working with Google for the Mi A1 Android One smartphone almost six months ago, it said during the launch keynote.. Introducing the new Android One device on Tuesday, Google's Jon Gold, Global Director of Android Partner Programs, stressed that the Xiaomi Mi A1 is an example of the future of Android One, which makes it clear that the project is no longer just about entry-level phones. Android One was introduced back in 2014 as a way to promote the stock Android experience and guarantee timely updates for phones in the budget segment, and India was one of the first countries in which devices were launched. However, it never took off the way Google had hoped, and now this new launch can be seen as a way to reimagine and reboot Android One.. The Xiaomi Mi A1 is being heavily marketed as "created by Xiaomi and powered by Google". At the launch event, Gold also hinted that Android One will soon span across a broad range of devices and price points. The Mi A1 has already been guaranteed to receive an update to Android 8.0 Oreo by the end of this year, and while it is too early, next year's Android P launch also falls within the guaranteed update period.. Xiaomi's Mi A1 not only has a lot riding on it for the Chinese company perspective but also for Google. Bringing on Xiaomi as a partner for Android One is a smart move, considering that the recently launched Redmi Note 4 and Redmi 4 are two of the top-selling smartphones in India. Xiaomi also now features in the top five smartphone brands in the country , according to IDC, and has sold 25 million smartphones in India so far. Its new retail strategy has also been helping it grow.. For Xiaomi, the Mi A1 is somewhat of a flagship with very competitive pricing, since the Mi 6 has still not launched in India. The Mi A1 appears to have decent specifications for its price, and the dual cameras could be a great addition. It will be interesting to see how well the Mi A1 is received by Xiaomi fans. Let's see if the effort pays off for both companies.. Xiaomi Mi A1 look and feel The Xiaomi Mi A1 definitely seems like an upgrade in terms of design compared to any Redmi device launched in India. While it carries forward design cues from already-launched Xiaomi devices, it manages to stand out. It is essentially a variant of the Mi 5X that was launched in China in July. This phone comes in Black, Gold, and Rose Gold colours. We received a Gold unit for review. Initially, only the Black and Gold colours will be available, with Rose Gold units arriving after a few weeks.. The front boasts of 2.5D curved-edge Gorilla Glass, which makes the phone feel premium. The rounded edges and corners mean that it fits easily in a palm, and the 7.3mm side profile gives it sleek appearance. Xiaomi has said repeatedly that the Mi A1 feels great in the hand, and we cannot entirely deny that. The all-metal body looks solid, but the back is very slippery and we had to be extra cautious when using this phone normally. We would suggest that buyers use some kind of case or cover with this phone. Compared to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and Mi Max 2 , the Mi A1 comes across as more premium.. iPhone 7 Plus on the left and Xiaomi Mi A1 on the right. Xiaomi has also compared the Mi A1 to the iPhone 7 Plus , and we can clearly see some similarities. The Mi A1's dual rear cameras are placed similarly, and the antenna lines also look like the ones on the iPhone 7 series. Being extra cautious about overheating, Xiaomi has claimed that all Mi A1 units in India will ship with dual pyrolytic graphite sheets which should radiate heat quickly and decrease temperatures by 2 degrees.. There are capacitive Android navigation buttons below the screen. The power and volume buttons have a good tactile feel, and are placed on the right where they are easily accessible with a thumb or forefinger depending on which hand you are using the phone with. The hybrid dual-SIM tray is on the left, while an Infrared emitter is placed on top. The bottom has a USB Type-C port, a speaker grille, and a 3.5mm audio jack.. The fingerprint reader is located at the back, and it works well. The dual cameras protrude slightly from the rear, and are accompanied by a two-tone flash. There's no branding at the front but you will find a familiar Mi logo on the lower back, along with an Android One logo.. Overall, the Mi A1 looks and feels better than any Xiaomi device we have reviewed to date. We liked the attention to detail like the neat-looking speaker grille and the separation lines at the back which stand out from the usual antenna bands we have been seeing on phones at this price. However, the Mi A1's main problem is that it looks a lot like many phones already out there including some Xiaomi and Vivo models. Since this phone is different from any other Xiaomi has released in terms of software and is expected to be the first of a new series, we would have liked it to stand out more.. Xiaomi Mi A1 specifications and software The Xiaomi Mi A1 is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor which we have previously seen under the hood of the Redmi Note 4 and Mi Max 2. At this phone's launch, Xiaomi indicated that this allows it to keep the price of the Mi A1 in check. The SoC is clocked at 2GHz and is coupled with 4GB of RAM. There's 64GB of storage, and expansion is possible using a microSD card (up to 128GB). Much like other Xiaomi devices, the Mi A1 has a hybrid dual-SIM design which means you have to choose between using two Nano-SIMs or one Nano-SIM and a microSD card.. The phone features a 5.5-inch LTPS display with a full-HD (1080x1920-pixel) resolution and a pixel density of 403ppi. It measures 155.4x75.8x7.3mm and weighs 165 grams and packs a non-removable 3080mAh battery. There's an Infrared emitter on the Mi A1 as well.. One of the most marketed features of this phone is its dual cameras at the back. There are two 12-megapixel cameras, one with a wide-angle lens and f/2.2 aperture, and the other with a telephoto lens and f/2.6 aperture. There's also a 5-megapixel front camera with an f/2.0 aperture and beautification mode.. Being an Android One device, the Xiaomi Mi A1 delivers a stock Android experience right out of the box. It runs on Android 7.1.2 Nougat which is one of the most recent versions of Nougat available for any Android device. While some will see stock Android as a welcome change from the MIUI software that comes preloaded on all other Xiaomi devices, there will be many who are fans of MIUI. Google has said that Mi A1 buyers will get unlimited high-quality storage for photos and videos, which is a common feature available across all Android smartphones and is not the same as the offer of unlimited photo and video backups at their original quality which the buyers of Pixel devices get.. One of the best things about stock Android is that there's supposed to be no bloatware, which is a big improvement for budget phones. Despite the promise of a stock UI, the Xiaomi Mi A1 will ship with three Mi apps: Feedback, Mi Remote, and Mi Store. The device also ships with a custom camera app because Google hasn't added dual camera support to its stock Android Camera app.. Compared to Android 7.1.1, the newer 7.1.2 is an incremental update with bug fixes. Popular Nougat features on the device include split-screen multitasking that allows users to work on two apps simultaneously; a shortcut to swap between the most recently used apps by double-tapping the Overview button; and app shortcuts which let you launch actions within supported apps by long-pressing their icons on the home screen. The Quick Settings toggles have received a refresh. You can swipe downwards on the fingerprint sensor to pull down the notifications shade, and launch the camera app by double-pressing the power button, which is handy for for quick shots. Finally, there is support for GIFs within the keyboard.. Xiaomi Mi A1 cameras The dual cameras on the Xiaomi Mi A1 make up one of its biggest features. Thanks to the two different lenses, the company claims you can get 2x optical zoom and blurred backgrounds. Starting off with the depth mode, we were able to take some great samples with bokeh effects. Most of our portrait shots had clearly defined edges but some did manage to overdo the blurring. Colours were natural and edges were defined well when there was adequate light, but this took a hit in low light. No manual effort is required, and the effect does work better than it does on the the Lenovo K8 Note ( Review ), which required some amount of manual adjustment. Xiaomi claims that its portrait mode can match the performance of the iPhone 7 Plus ( Review ) and OnePlus 5 ( Review ), but in our opinion, the Mi A1 is still few software updates away from reaching that standard.. Autofocusing on the Mi A1 is quick, and is mostly accurate even in different light conditions. Phase detection autofocus (PDAF) and face detection help the camera lock focus in no time. We managed some decent landscape shots, but macro shots didn't have the kind of sharpness and detail that we observed with the Mi Max 2 ( Review ). The phone was able to capture good amounts of texture and detail with low noise, but only in good light. During our review, we also noticed some exposure problems in very high-contrast scenes where details in the shadows were completely off.. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Mi A1 camera samples. We noticed extensive noise in evening and nighttime shots, even with light sources around. In completely dark spots, the Mi A1 struggled a lot and most photos were indistinct despite the autofocus working well. Xiaomi claims that the Mi A1's camera app has a low-light enhancement feature, but we didn't find any differences with it enabled. The Mi Max 2 offers better low-light results.. The Mi A1's camera app guides you when you are in depth mode, showing warnings like "It's too dark now" and "Move farther from the object" which will be helpful for new users.. The 5-megapixel front camera took some good selfies in good light, and details were fairly good. Selfies taken at night were almost completely dark without some kind of light source around.. Overall, the Mi A1's dual cameras are a great feature to have at this price point, and results won't usually disappoint you. Low-light performance, however, needs a lot of work.. Xiaomi Mi A1 performance We found the Mi A1's screen bright enough, and both text and images look sharp. Viewing angles is good as well. However, we found the glass to be too reflective for our liking and we had to push the brightness all the way up under direct sunlight.. Like the Redmi Note 4 and Mi Max 2, the Mi A1 is a capable performer. It's snappy and efficient for most tasks, thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor. 4GB of RAM is good enough for multitasking, and allows you to run multiple apps without any trouble. Touch response was good, and we didn't face any kind of lag throughout the review period. We had a good time playing heavy games such as Last Day on Earth: Survival and Asphalt 8: Airborne. Even light games like Subway Surfers and Candy Crash ran smoothly. We also found the 5.5-inch display great for watching videos. The Mi A1 managed to produce benchmark scores similar to what we have seen with the Mi Max 2 and Redmi Note 4. AnTuTu gave us 66,381 points while GFXBench returned a score of 27fps. The phone also managed 8,926 in 3D Mark Ice Storm Extreme and 28,955 in Quadrant.. Xiaomi says it has used dual pyrolytic graphite sheets to dissipate heat effectively, and we can say that we faced no major problems when gaming for hours. We didn't have trouble when gaming, but we did find that the phone gets warm when it is being charged.. The Mi A1 supports 4G with VoLTE (voice over LTE), and call clarity was good. The phone was able to latch on to networks even in weak spots, which is great. The IR emitter worked flawlessly with the Mi Remote app; the same as with other Xiaomi devices.. The speaker is loud enough to fill a small room, and sound is fairly clear. Xiaomi says that this phone has a 10V smart power amplifier for enhancing audio through earphones, and it has audio calibration algorithms as well. The experience with earphones was good, and you can safely choose the Mi A1 as your main device for listening music on your daily commutes. Our only issue is that this phone doesn't ship with earphones.. Xiaomi Mi A1 battery life The 3080mAh battery in the Mi A1 lasted for roughly 15 hours with heavy usage. We had Outlook, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Telegram, Gmail, and WhatsApp running in the background at all times. In our HD video loop test, the Mi A1 managed to run for 10 hours and 18 minutes, which was decent but not great. One of the problems that the Mi A1 will face is that other Xiaomi devices have better battery performance. The company has stated that the Mi A1 will be shipping with a bulky charger keeping in mind the patchy electricity situation in India, which seems like a gimmick to us. The phone took roughly two hours to charge fully, which isn't too bad.. Verdict When the Android One programme was first launched, it promised a lot but eventually faded away. With Xiaomi, Google has managed to put a fresh face for Android One, but how well the new plan goes is yet to be seen. When it comes to price, the Xiaomi Mi A1 is a firecracker of a package. The metal body and overall finish are superb, while the display and overall performance are good. Users will also get to experience stock Android on a Xiaomi phone for the first time, so those who never liked MIUI, this one's for you. Things which need attention are battery life and low-light photography, which even other Xiaomi models are better at.. 14,999, the Xiaomi Mi A1 will be available across several channels including Flipkart, Mi.com, offline retail partners, and the company's own Mi Home stores. It will be going on sale starting September 12. Considering that Xiaomi has managed to make a huge name for itself with its MIUI software, it will be interesting to see the response to this phone in India and other markets where it's launching..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Dual-camera (12-megapixel, F2.6 aperture), Autofocus (Phase detection). Software Features: Manual focus, Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control.

Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 14 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

CRITIC REVIEW Xiaomi Mi A1 Review: Offers the 'power' of Android One. Android One – Google’s long-lost project to provide pure Android experience on budget smartphones – has made a comeback in India. Till now, the tech giant has partnered with Indian smartphone brands such as Micromax, Sharp and Lava for Android One.

Android One makes the Xiaomi Mi A1 a phone you’ll want to use. Geekbench 4 CPU: 4200 Multi-Core/867 Single-Core. 3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 463. If you’ve been tempted by Xiaomi’s often well-designed smartphones, but put off by the custom MIUI “theme” layered over the Android software; then the Xiaomi Mi A1 is the answer to your problems. There are no software tweaks from Xiaomi because the Mi A1 runs Android One — the Google operating system designed for low- and mid-range phones. It promises regular software and security updates, like a Google Pixel smartphone , plus all the usual Google apps including the Google Play Store pre-installed. In our Xiaomi Mi A1 review, we explain how it’s not just the software that’s a winner, but the hardware too.. There is one glaring flaw we should mention first: The lack of 4G LTE support in the U.S. The Xiaomi Mi A1, even the so-called Global version, won’t connect to GSM 4G networks in the U.S., meaning you’ll have to make do with 3G speeds. and much of Europe will be fine. We’ve had ours running on the O2 network in the U.K. With that out of the way, let’s talk about how good the Mi A1 is. First, it costs 210 euros from the Mi Spain store , or somewhere around $210 to $250 if you use an online retailer in China. That makes it slightly cheaper in Europe than one of our current absolute favorite budget phones , the Honor 7X. (the Mi A1 is a tad more expensive in the U.S.). For that you get a sleek, smooth metal body that’s 7.3mm thick, a 5.5-inch LCD screen with a 1,920 x 1,080-pixel resolution, a fingerprint scanner, and a dual-lens 12-megapixel camera on the back. It’s all powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, with 4GB of RAM.. Exactly what we want from a mid-range phone.. The Mi A1’s style is reminiscent of the Xiaomi Redmi 4X , and identical to the Mi 5X. It’s simple but attractive, and could be easily mistaken for the OnePlus 5. or an iPhone 7 Plus. It’s comfortable to hold, and super light at 165 grams. We carried it around while on vacation in Japan, along with several other phones, and it happily slipped into a pocket or bag without a fuss.. The build quality is good, although the volume rocker audibly rattles when you put it down on a table. There is a fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone, far from the camera lenses, and it is accurate and quick to respond. On the bottom is a USB Type-C charging port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.. Battery life is solid, with the phone easily lasting a day with its 3,080mAh cell. This is undoubtedly aided thanks to the Android One software and its uncluttered, and simple approach. Thanks to the Google software, the phone also delivered on timely security updates. Since using the phone, we’ve received October, November, and December’s Android security patch updates, along with another update fixing bugs and improving the device. It felt almost unnatural, having so many important software updates in such a timely manner on an Android phone. It’s the way things really should be.. There are a few pre-installed Xiaomi apps, including Mi Remote to use with the IR blaster, plus the Xiaomi camera app. The Snapdragon 625 processor isn’t that fast, and although scrolling and moving around Android isn’t slow, wading through some apps can be. We noticed hesitation and less-than-smooth scrolling in the Google Play Store, YouTube, and apps like Twitter. It’s not bad, but it’s noticeable, especially if you’re coming from a higher-performance smartphone.. We ran the Mi A1 through a few benchmark tests:. The results almost match what we saw from the Honor 7X, a phone which uses a Kirin 659 processor and also has 4GB of RAM. Ultimately for everyday tasks, with a little gaming thrown in, the Mi A1 is a perfectly usable and surprisingly capable companion.. That’s all before you start using the camera, which is excellent for such a low-cost phone and a solid competitor to the Honor 7X , and other similarly-priced dual-lens camera phones. The two lenses have 12 megapixels each, an f/2.2 aperture, and a 2x optical zoom feature. The front camera has 5 megapixels, as well as a portrait mode.. It takes vivid, natural, and interesting pictures in normal light, but the cameras struggle a little with noise when the light is poor. The dual-lens system for adding a blurred background for portraits works surprisingly well — it’s easy to use, fast, and produces some good results. We were very happy with the photos taken by the Mi A1 considering the price, especially for sharing photos on social media. The portrait mode adds plenty of fun, and is a feature many phones don’t share at this price. The video camera even has a slow-motion mode for extra creativity.. Downsides? Apart from the 4G LTE problems in the U.S., the Mi A1 doesn’t have NFC, so it can’t be used for Android Pay. We also found the gold rear panel scuffs easily just from sitting in a bag or pocket, so a case may be in order here. Also, compared to the minimal bezels around the Honor 7X’s screen, the Mi A1 doesn’t look quite so modern. Still, we vastly prefer Android One over Huawei’s EMUI user interface on the Honor phone. It ultimately comes down to what’s more valuable to you — timely software and security updates, or style.. Choose the Mi A1 and you will be very happy. It’s exactly what we want from a mid-range phone — no software clutter, a good camera, a pretty screen, a simple design, and a low price tag..

Review Xiaomi Mi A1 Review: Truly A1!. Xiaomi Mi A1 Review: Truly A1!. Xiaomi Mi A1 features a dual-camera setup and runs on stock Android. But is that enough to tempt users? Check out our review.. Published: September 15, 2017 2:52 PM IST. It’s no secret that when shopping for a capable smartphone in the budget segment, the shortlist invariably mentions Xiaomi. But since the launch of the Mi 5 early last year, there’s been an absence of what you would call a premium flagship device. While there is little hope of the Mi 6 coming to India, Xiaomi did recently launch a device. that it calls a flagship – the Mi A1. The new smartphone is aggressively priced at Rs 14,999, boasts a decent spec sheet, and its highlights include a dual-camera setup and near-stock Android operating system.. The Xiaomi Mi A1 is a part of Google’s Android One initiative. In other words, it runs on stock Android Nougat 7.1.2, and an Android Oreo roll out is promised before the end of this year. The Mi A1 is described as ‘created by Xiaomi and powered by Google’, and the experience of using it is vastly different from the other Xiaomi devices available in India. Having spent a considerable amount of time with it, here’s my review of the Xiaomi Mi A1.. Let’s start with the design, and there is no denying that Mi A1 is a premium-looking device. The overall design is distinctly Xiaomi , and a lot of elements seems to have been retained from the Redmi devices. But the Mi A1 is clearly a step up. At 7.3mm thickness, the device is quite sleek, and the rounded edges help it sit comfortably in one’s palms. Adding a touch of class is the 2.5D curved glass up front, which covers the front of the device.. If I were to nitpick though, the glass up front makes the device quite reflective. The back panel, on the other hand, looks eerily similar to the iPhone 7 Plus. The antenna lines at the top and bottom edges, and the placement of the dual-camera module remind you of Apple’s smartphone. What helps differentiate is the circular fingerprint sensor in the center, and the Mi and Android One logos. These are however small grouches, and something that you are bound to oversee during your day-to-day usage.. As mentioned, the highlight of the Mi A1 is the dual-camera setup. This also happens to be Xiaomi’s first smartphone in India to come with such features. The setup includes a pair of 12-megapixel sensors where one is a wide-angle lens, and the other a telephoto lens. Both combine to shoot photos with DSLR-like bokeh effects. There is a dedicated Portrait mode that is meant for shooting photos with blurred background. Courtesy of the telephoto lens, the camera also allows for 2x lossless optical zoom.. A similar camera setup is found on devices like the OnePlus 5 and the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. While it will be too much to expect the Mi A1’s cameras to offer those kind of results, they don’t necessarily disappoint.. When the lighting conditions are ideal, the Mi A1’s cameras are able to capture some really good portrait shots. Colors looked natural, with just the right amount of blurring, and clearly defined edges. Equally impressive is how effortless it is to shoot good portrait shots. The camera app guides you with tips like ‘Stereo mode helps you blur the background. The object shouldn’t be further than 2 meters’, and ‘Place subject within 2.5 meters’.. With support for Phase Detection auto-focus (PDAF), and face detection, the camera is able to quickly focus on subjects. Apart from portraits, the camera is equally capable of shooting good landscape shots. But with optical image stabilization missing, the camera’s performance takes a hit when the lighting conditions are less than ideal. In low-light conditions the photos are affected by noise, and lack of sharpness and details. Needless to say, the portrait mode is rendered useless when shooting photos in low-light.. Up front, there is a 5-megapixel camera that is more than capable of clicking good selfies. With face detection, the camera is again able to quickly focus on one’s face. The photos are also good enough to be instantly shared on social media without the need for edits. As we have seen with Xiaomi’s smartphones, there’s again a beauty mode that lets you tweak your skin tone, or make your face look slim. Again the feature works quite well, and most of the times, the results do not look gimmicky.. Another talking point on the Mi A1 is the operating system. While there are no doubt a large number of fans of Xiaomi’s MIUI , using a smartphone with stock Android has its own charm. I, for one, fall in the second category. The minimalism and smoothness of stock Android is what I prefer, and that is what I personally like most about the Mi A1.. There are only four Mi apps installed out-of-the-box, and two of them can be immediately uninstalled. These include the camera app, Mi Remote, Feedback and the Mi Store. Of these, only the Mi Remote and Mi Store apps can be uninstalled. Another advantage of having stock Android is Google Assistant , which is among the best voice assistants out there.. My only disappointment here is Google Photos storage. Being a part of Android One, you would expect Google to offer unlimited photo storage, but that is not the case. On the Mi A1, you get unlimited storage for high-quality photos and videos. This is however different from the Pixel smartphones that have unlimited photo and video backup in original quality. There is however 64GB internal storage, which can be expanded using a microSD card.. With these points out of the way, let’s quickly take a look at Mi A1’s other specifications and features. The 5.5-inch full HD display is bright, crisp, and has good viewing angles. Under the hood is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 octa-core SoC, which has proven its worth on the popular Redmi Note 4. Paired with 4GB of RAM, the smartphone is able to easily handle day-to-day tasks, along with multitasking, with above average mid-range performance.. Even graphic-intensive games like Asphalt 8 Airborne , and Riptide GP2 work quite well. But crank up the settings, and after a point you do notice a bit of drop in frame rates. Xiaomi has also done well to stop the device from overly heating up. Underneath, the company has opted for dual pyrolytic graphite sheets to dissipate heat effectively. During my time with the phone, I can barely remember a time when the device heated up. The back panel however did get a tad warm when using the camera for a long time, playing games, or when the device is put on charge.. Keeping the device ticking is a 3,080mAh battery. In my day-to-day use, the battery was able to easily last a day on a single charge. My use included a constantly buzzing Slack account, WhatsApp, two email accounts, and social accounts like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Add in some game time, video and music playback, and about an hour worth of calling, and you will have to charge the phone before going to sleep. Suffice to say, some of Xiaomi’s Redmi smartphones in India have a much better battery performance. Charging is via the USB Type-C port, and the time taken from zero to 100 percent is a shade under two hours.. Call quality is decent even when on roaming, and the voice clarity via the earpiece is quite good. The speaker on the smartphone too is particularly loud. It comes with a 10V smart power amplifier for enhancing audio through earphones, and it also uses DHS Audio Calibration Algorithm. With a focus on audio performance, it is a tad disappointing that the Mi A1 doesn’t come with bundled earphones.. There is very little that is wrong with the Xiaomi Mi A1. While Xiaomi’s hardware quality has rarely been questioned, the stock Android OS on board the Mi A1 takes the overall experience to a new level. Many see this as the return of Google’s Android One initiative, and you can see why the search giant chose Xiaomi. Well done Xiaomi, you just reminded us that Android One exists. If you look beyond Android One, the Mi A1 on its own is a very capable device that is well built, features a decent list of specifications and features, and is aggressively priced as well. The dual cameras may struggle a bit in low light, but the photos clicked during the day more than make up for it. At Rs 14,999, the Mi A1 comes very close to being a perfect mid-range smartphone, and I would highly recommend it..

Xiaomi phone launches generate a lot of speculation among consumers. Most of the time, the phone is launched in China already and it’s then a guessing game as to which phone will arrive in India next. Not all Xiaomi phones launched in China have seen the light of day here. But it looks like Xiaomi is planning to change that.. The Mi 5X, Xiaomi’s dual camera sporting smartphone was launched in China a while back. So when the Xiaomi India Twitter handle tweeted about a dual camera phone launching soon in India, everyone assumed it would be the Mi 5X. Xiaomi had other plans though, and it went ahead and launched its first Android One smartphone in the form of Xiaomi Mi A1. While the phone isn’t any different from the Mi 5X, the Mi A1 is a stock Android version sporting smartphone. So let us see if this phone has the potential to create a shake up in the Rs 15,000 price bracket phone market.. Xiaomi has paid a lot of attention to the design and it shows in the well sculpted phone. The metal unibody encases the phone and the antenna lines are seen on the top and bottom portions. The Mi and Android One branding are prominently seen on the rear side. There’s a circular fingerprint scanner placed conveniently where your index finger will rest. On the top left hand corner is the dual camera module which juts out slightly from the plane of the rear side of the phone. A dual LED flash unit is placed beside it. The matte finish on the rear side of the Mi A1, ensures that it does not collect smudges or fingerprints, as we have come to see with glossy surfaces.. Xiaomi Mi A1 with the box. The corners are rounded and the sides have a rounded design around the edges helping you get a good hold on this otherwise slippery phone. You’ve to be really careful, while using the phone one-handed lest it slip from your hands. The edges have chamfering which shows up just around the 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass, thanks to the shiny chrome. Volume rocker and power/standby buttons are placed on the right hand edge and the dual SIM tray is located on the left hand side. The bottom edge has the 3.5 mm audio jack, USB Type C port and the speaker section whereas the top edge has the infrared blaster. The phone is just 7.3 mm thick and weighs 165 grams.. The Xiaomi Mi A1 comes with a metal unibody design. The display is a 5.5-inch full HD panel and the bezels on the top and bottom of the phone are thicker than the ones on the side. The software buttons placed on the base are not programmable. Overall, the build quality is quite refined, there is barely anything to complain about and for the price it is being offered at, you can’t really ask for much.. Xiaomi phones are known for their value proposition offerings. With the Mi A1, Xiaomi has ambitious goals of trying to woo an audience who was staying away from the Xiaomi ecosystem, as they were not sold on the MIUI user interface. The success of phones from the Moto line up over the years, is proof enough that there is a significant audience out there who prefer a pure Android experience. Xiaomi phones with their rich feature set at competitive price points were the perfect platforms to try out this experiment on and with the Mi A1, the smartphone maker. has finally decided to chart into this territory.. The bases houses the 3.5mm Audo jack, USB Type C port and the speaker section. The highlight of the phone is the presence of Android Nougat 7.1.2 OS without any skinning atop it, which makes it stand apart from all the Xiaomi phones released so far. There are only three Xiaomi apps that come pre-bundled - Mi Remote, Mi Feedback and Mi Store. And since this is a dual camera smartphone, it comes with a Xiaomi camera app instead of the Google native camera app.. left hand edge has the hybrid dual SIM card tray. It comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC which houses an octa-core processor clocked at 2.0 GHz along with Adreno 506 GPU. There’s 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage which is expandable to 256 GB using a microSD card slot.. The dual rear camera setup is the second USP of the phone. There are two 12 MP sensors, on of them having an f/2.2 aperture with a 26 mm focal length, whereas the other zoom lens has an f/2.6 aperture and 50 mm focal length. Thanks to this arrangement, you get 2x optical zoom out of the box. The video camera is capable of shooting at 2160p at 30 fps and 1080p at 60 fps. On the front, there is a 5 MP selfie camera.. Android One branding on the base. On the connectivity front, you get a hybrid dual SIM slot, support for 4G networks, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n/ac and Wi-Fi DIrect, Bluetooth 4.2 LE and supports infrared booster. It supports GPS with A-GPS, GLONASS and BDS. Finally, there is a 3,080 mAh battery powering the system.. Xiaomi Mi A1 comes with a 5.5-inch FullHD display. Xiaomi Mi A1 comes with a 5.5-inch full HD display which is protected by a 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass, which ensures that the display scratch resistant. It uses a LTPS IPS LCD panel. is quite reflective though when there is a remotely dark scene which can get irritating at times. Even when watching it from steep angles, I did not notice much contrast shift. Watching movies, playing games on this display is a great experience. Text and icons are sharp thanks to the 403 ppi pixel density. Brightness levels are up to the mark, although the maximum brightness makes the display seems a bit washed out. Considering this is an Android One smartphone, it comes with Android 7.1.2 Nougat OS out of the box, without any MIUI skin atop it. Since MIUI has been such an integral part of any Xiaomi phone, it will take some time getting used to the fact that this stock Android phone is indeed made by Xiaomi. Thanks to stock Android, there is very little bloat on the phone, apart from the four Xiaomi made apps -- Mi Store, Feedback, Mi Remote and the camera app.. Xiaomi Mi A1 comes with stock Android 7.1.2 Nougat OS. There isn’t an app tray and you just swipe up to access all your apps, just like in Pixel. There is no floating Google icon as we had seen on the Pixel which gives a direct access to Now, but the first home screen is a Google search bar with the latest feed. There is a Mi Services tab in the Settings menu in case you want to activate those. You also get the split screen mode and Google Assistant.. Overall the user interface is clean and quite responsive. I did notice some lag in the camera app however, specially when you are switching between the zooming. The transition is not instant but seems to appear gradually. It does support gestures such as opening the camera app by double pressing on the power button. And you can check notifications by swiping down on your fingerprint sensor.. Android One handsets when they were first announced belonged to the entry level category with basic specifications. But Xiaomi Mi A1 offers an impressive mid-range feature set which ensures that day to day performance of the device is lag-free. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC paired with 4 GB RAM is plenty to handle any tasks thrown at it.. Yes, there are the one-off frame drops that you notice when playing high end games such as Asphalt Extreme, but that is par for the course. The Mi A1 would heat up to some extent while playing heavy games, but while watching videos the temperatures were controlled. There was rarely any instance when the app shut down due to overheating. Yes, some apps did randomly shutdown, but it was more of a software bug. This was observed once or twice while using the device for review. 4 GB RAM ensures that you can have many apps open at the same time and switching between apps isn’t an issue. The only lag that was noticeable was in the camera app when I tried using the zoom function.. Xiaomi Mi A1 benchmarks Infogram. Call quality was great and audio was crisp. The speakers are quite loud and there were many instances where I did not use earphones to watch YouTube videos. The benchmark numbers are in line with other Snapdragon 625 chipset sporting phones. It ticks off all the boxes of a mid-range device. In day to day usage, the user experience was quite good.. After the Mi 6 that was announced in April this year, this is Xiaomi’s second foray into a dual rear camera sporting smartphone. There are two 12 MP sensors, one of them having an f/2.2 aperture with a 26 mm focal length which is the wide-angle camera, whereas the other zoom lens has an f/2.6 aperture and 50 mm focal length. Thanks to this arrangement, you get 2x optical zoom out of the box. The video camera is capable of shooting at 2160p at 30fps and 1080p at 60fps. On the front, there is a 5 MP selfie camera.. Dual rear camera setup on the Xiaomi Mi A1. Since the native Google camera app does not support dual camera setups, you get a custom Xiaomi camera app. The interface of the app is quite similar to the one we have seen on MIUI OS sporting Xiaomi phones. You get the filters on the left and camera switcher on the right hand side and at the top you have the direct button to activate portrait mode, one to activate HDR mode and another to activate flash. Options throw up familiar features such as panorama mode, manual mode, Beautify mode, Square mode, Group selfie mode among others. In the video section you get slow motion and time lapse features as well.. When it comes to camera performance, the daylight shots come out well. Focussing is quick and the photo is packed with details. Yes, there is a loss of detail around the edges, but nothing that takes away from the photograph. The tap to zoom function isn’t the quickest around and you see a definite lag before it actually switches from 1x to 2x optical zoom. Nothing that a future software patch cannot fix.. Things change drastically when you operate the camera in low light. On most occasions I realised that the camera was not able to lock onto a focus. And at times, even after locking on a focus, the final output was not that detailed. There is too much noise which avoids giving us a sharp image in low light. The algorithms certainly need a lot more work and Xiaomi has to look into this aspect, as this is one thing that sticks out in this otherwise great phone.. Portrait mode is decent, but it requires a lot of patience. Forget taking street portraits as you will need to find a subject who is ready to wait for a while before the portrait mode offers a shallow depth of field. With objects such as statues, the portrait mode functioning was a hit and a miss as you will notice in the image samples below.. Xiaomi Mi A1 lasts a good day on regular usage which involves surfing the web, couple of accounts synced on mail, Slack, WhatsApp conversations, around 30-40 mins of gaming, some video viewing and listening to audio. You can easily derive a screen on time of over 3.5 hours in most cases. In the PC Mark for Android test, we got around 11 hr 25 mins which is good enough for regular usage. It takes around 90 mins to go from 0 to 100 percent charge.. Xiaomi offers a well rounded phone at Rs 14,999 with stock Android to boot. If you are in the market for a Rs 15,000 phone, you will not go wrong with the Xiaomi Mi A1. Of course, you will have to factor in one of its major drawbacks - poor low light photography. But that apart, there is fairly little to complain with the Mi A1. And thankfully, it will not just be available on flash sales which gets over in seconds. Xiaomi has also partnered with a lot of offline retail partners for the Mi A1.. If you want to look elsewhere, then the Moto G5S Plus is an option to consider. We will be putting out a review of the same soon, so stay tuned. If you still want to opt for a MIUI Xiaomi phone, then the Redmi Note 4 is still quite a capable device.. #Xiaomi Mi a1 Price In India. #Xiaomi Mi a1 Vs Moto g5s Plus.

A lover of Android, keyboards, and other things that go beep. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Xiaomi Mi A1 is a surprisingly good phone, but it's not available everywhere. of the Android One program, which targets mostly developing countries. has almost no presence in the US, but those who can purchase this fine little phone are getting a sweet treat very soon. Android 8.0 Oreo is in beta with a final release expected soon, and it brings some cool new features.. Mi A1 is part of Android One, it runs a mostly stock build of the operating system. Google helps to update these devices, and there's very little added bloatware. Unfortunately, it launched with Android 7.1.2, but Xiaomi. promised an update to Oreo before the end of 2017. Well, we're really coming down to the wire, but all the pieces are in place.. Telecomtalk , the beta version of Oreo is live on a small number of units as a beta test. This update brings improvements like picture-in-picture video, notification channels, autofill app support, and more efficient background process management. In addition—and this could be huge—the Oreo beta enables fast charging on the Xiaomi. After the update, the battery can charge completely in 92 minutes versus about two hours before the update. This is based on testing with the OnePlus 5T's charger. That's not a Qualcomm Quick Charge adapter, but it can do about 20W (5A 4V). Mi A1 was probably pulling closer to. 5V and 2.4A like most non-OP devices on that cable. It would probably be even faster with the proper charger.. still promises the final build of Oreo before the end of the year, so it could appear at any time in the next couple days. You'll have to wait it out—there's no way to get into the closed beta.

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Mobile computing symphony on a budget. Redmi Note 4 like hardware but better. The Mi A1’s clutter free Android One certified experience along with tried and tested hardware, and dual camera capability gives you the premium feel under a budget. Xiaomi ticks all the right boxes.. Best dual camera system on a budget. Smaller battery than Redmi Note 4. When one talks about budget or mid range Android smartphones invariably one tends to gravitate towards a Chinese phenomenon called Xiaomi. Over the last few years, it has made a mockery of what one should expect in a smartphone that costs a third of an iPhone. Ironically, this comes from a company which has been dubbed the Apple of China.. Its phones have offered 90 percent of what makes an iPhone experience — design, simplicity of use and a wholistic mobile computer — in a package that costs a third or fourth. It has mastered the game, however, some Android purists always yearned for more. Perhaps more refined software they wanted, faster updates, and conspiracy theorists even believed their phones weren't fully secure, so perhaps Xiaomi could've made its phone harder to crack. They could've done it and well, now they have done it with the Mi A1 which is a union between strange bedfellows — Xiaomi and Google. We say this because Xiaomi’s software story has always been underpinned by putting Google’s Android behind a shade, and putting its MiUI interface at the centre of the galaxy of its products.. With A1, Xiaomi has embraced Google beleaguered Android One programme which strived to offer great hardware and software for a sliver of what entry level consumers were getting. This programme failed partially because of the entry of Xiaomi in India which made a mockery of the phones that launched with Android One. Now that Xiaomi has rebranded its Mi 5X smartphone and put Google’s pure Android experience at the centre of the computing interface that will be used by the end user. What we have here is a potential hydrogen bomb for the budget smartphone market because on paper this phone marries stupendous hardware, a refined design aesthetic and liquid and secure software experience in a package that costs 1/4th of the current generation iPhone.. The Rs 15,000 price band is a crowded one. Around about this price there are some great phones, from Xiaomi included (Redmi Note 4 which is possibly the best one and certainly is the best selling). There’s the new Nokia 6 which is making a big deal about stock Android and security updates, there’s the recently launched Moto G5S Plus and well, there are bunch of devices from Lenovo, CoolPad, Smartron and even the beleaguered Micromax which recently released the smart looking Canvas Infinity. In the space, then there’s the South Korean giant Samsung which sells its Galaxy J line of phones like hotcakes.. With a combination of some of the best specs — Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, dual cameras, and vanilla Android and updates coming from the big folks at Mountain View, this is possibly the best value proposition anyone could've imagined for this price point.. Xiaomi has been killing it on the hardware front, but with Google in cahoots, it has fixed the final piece in the puzzle; great software with timely updates and a promised upgrade to Oreo sometime later in the year. On paper only, this one is a winner.. In a nutshell, the Mi A1’s design can be called a lovechild between the OnePlus 5 and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. The facade of the phone will remind you of the Redmi Note 4 which shouldn't surprise anyone as they are the same family of device, however its corners are more rounded which is kind of amazing as it looks nicer than the Redmi. On the back, it looks a lot like the OnePlus 5. It has a similarly style of a camera visor/hump, and the antenna lines are also similarly designed. Essentially this is repackaged Xiaomi Mi 5X which was announced a month or so ago and any similarities to some of the phones named here isn't a bad thing at all. Criticise it for being derivative but it is a very well built phone and for its price, it is amazing that these days the consumer can get such a high quality product.. Looks aside, this is a very functional device in terms of ergonomics. Its svelte at 7.3mm which ranks this phone amongst the slimmest around. At the same time it is also pretty light at 165 grams. By no means it is the lightest phone on the planet, but it’s a very well balanced one as it doesn't feel like something that’s feather light nor is it too heavy. The weight is also distributed nicely so it feels great even if you're using it one handed.. Obviously, one handed usage on this phone isn't peaches and cream because it has a big 5.5-inch display, but that’s no biggie as that’s a pretty standard size these days. What’s not so great is that it has a big chin below the screen and quite a large top bezel. This also means, the new Moto G5S Plus is shorter than it. It is a minor quibble in the scheme of things, but a quibble nonetheless.. One of the nicer things about the design of the phone that makes it so ergonomic is the way the chassis tapers and curves ever so gently from the sides towards the back. It is a seamless line that typifies the spine of the phone offering a smooth grip and great in hand feel for the device.. On the back, there’s also a fingerprint scanner which is placed to a nicety as it can be reached very easily with one hand. There are other neat touches to this phone. For instance, unlike the Redmi Note 4 it has a USB Type C connector on the bottom, flanked by a very loud single speaker and a 3.5mm jack. On the other side, there’s even an IR blaster which is very handy and yet strangely missing on most phones launched these days. This phone continues to use capacitive Android keys which is a good or bad thing depending the way you like to setup your phone.. Next Page Android One at its heart.

Mobiles / Xiaomi Mobile Phones / Xiaomi Mi A1 Price in India. User Visits: 17,256 Compare. The Android One project was an ambitious initiative by Google to bring stock Android and impressive hardware in budget. However, for some reason the series did not take off and for a while went AWOL. Now, the brand is making a comeback with Xiaomi and Mi A1 is aiming to revive Android One again. The device is quite impressive on paper and has also been lauded in quite a few reviews. Here is a brief overview of the device for those who are looking to get their hands on once.. As we have already mentioned, the Xiaomi Mi A1 is an Android One device. This means that it comes with the latest Android operating system in its stock avatar- Android Nougat. While the installed OS is not quite the latest, the device will get the Android Oreo as well as soon as it is released to general public. To have the build and performance of a Xiaomi device along with the smoothness that comes from stock Android, Mi A1 makes for a good option.. Having the Android One device comes with yet another perk, which is that the software aspect is controlled by Google. What this means is that as soon as a major Android update is pushed, Android One handsets will be the first in the queue to get the same. With Android Oreo update right around the corner, this is the right time to pick the device.. The Xiaomi Mi A1 is the first ever Android One device as well as first from the brand to come with a dual camera module on the rear panel. The device boasts of a pair of 12-megapixel snappers on the rear panel, of which one is a telephoto lens. What this means is that the device is capable of capturing stunning images with good depth of field, in other words, bokeh images.. The front panel of the handset is adorned by a 5.5-inch display that flaunts a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Since the display of the device is usually the most delicate aspect, it helps to have some sort of protection on the top. The display on this handset features a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass, which protects it against minor scratches and shatters.. Xiaomi has equipped the Mi A1 with a beefy 3,080mAh battery, which would easily see through a day’s worth of usage. However, the handset is missing the support for fast charging, which means that you will have to wait for a little while when charging the device from zero per cent.. At this price point, with dual camera module and stock Android, Xiaomi Mi A1 makes for a compelling buy. If you are looking for a device that performs like a champ and also is an imaging powerhouse, look no further and grab your Mi A1 today.. Xiaomi Mi A1 Price in India. 14,499 .00.

Xiaomi Mi A1 Smartphone Review: Android One At Its Best. September 26, 2017 - Written By Alexander Maxham. Top-notch hardware, low price tag, and stock Android all make for an incredible smartphone, which is the Xiaomi Mi A1.. Often times when a new Xiaomi smartphone is announced, many people love the hardware but will comment something to the effect of “I wish it had stock Android”, or “if only it didn’t have MIUI”. Well Xiaomi is known for listening to its customers and potential customers, and they have done just that. The Xiaomi Mi A1 has the hardware you’d expect from Xiaomi, with the stock Android look and feel you’d expect from Google. But the real question here is how well do these two merge together? Is the Xiaomi Mi A1 worth picking up? Let’s find out.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. The Xiaomi Mi A1 sports a 5.5-inch 1920 x 1080 resolution IPS LCD display, along with Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3 on top for protection. This gives you a pixel density of 403 pixels per inch, and about 70.1% of the front of the device is covered with the display. Unlike the Mi MIX 2, the Mi A1 has some rather large top and bottom bezels, which makes the display-to-body ratio a bit lower than most other smartphones in 2017. Additionally, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor is powering the show with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (there is a micro SD card slot available for expanding the storage as well, if needed).. Xiaomi has brought it’s dual camera setup over to the Mi A1. The setup is comprised of two 12-megapixel sensors, with one standard 28mm lens and the other being a telephoto at 50mm. With apertures of f/2.2 and f/2.6 respectively. The rear-facing cameras can record in 4K at up to 30fps, while it can do slow motion at 720p with 120fps. The front-facing camera is a 5-megapixel shooter, and is capable of recording in 1080p resolution.. Other odds and ends include a 3.5mm headphone jack, and no NFC which means no support for Android Pay. It does support dual-band WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, so you’ll get plenty fast WiFi speeds out of the Mi A1. There’s also Bluetooth 4.2 LE on board. When it comes to GPS, that is using GLONASS, BDS and A-GPS to determine your location. Finally, the Xiaomi Mi A1 is powered by a 3080mAh battery, along with Android 7.1.2 Nougat on-board.. Included with the Mi A1, you’ll get a SIM ejection tool, a USB-A to USB-C cable and a wall adapter. Along with the paperwork that is in every smartphone box. The packaging is rather minimal, but it’s still up to Xiaomi’s standards. Unfortunately, there is no case included here. Something that Xiaomi does include with a number of its own smartphones.. Xiaomi has been touting that the Mi A1 is an all-metal unibody smartphone, and that it is. The company offers it in three colors, pink, gold and black. The model that Xiaomi sent over to us is the pink one, which actually looks pretty nice on the Mi A1. The gold and pink models get a white front while the black gets a black front. The Mi A1 does feel very solid in the hand, which is not a surprise at all. The back of the Mi A1 does look a bit busy though. In the upper left-hand corner, you’ll find the dual LED flash along with the dual 12-megapixel cameras. Below that, and centered, you’ll find the fingerprint sensor. Towards the bottom of the phone you’ll find the Mi logo, a bunch of regulatory information and then the Android One logo. So it looks like quite a bit of information on the back compared to other smartphones. But some of that is due to the Android One logo being there – likely a requirement of Google.. Button placement on the Mi A1 is pretty standard for Xiaomi. Placing the power button below the volume rocker on the right-hand side. The left-hand side houses the SIM card tray. This SIM card tray can either house two SIM cards or a SIM card and a micro SD card. Unfortunately it can’t do two SIMs and a micro SD card. Which would be ideal for those that do use two SIM cards. But Xiaomi did include a decent amount of storage in the Mi A1, so that storage shouldn’t be an issue for those that do want to use two SIM cards. On the bottom of the phone you’ll find a speaker grille on the right side, the USB-C port in the middle and a 3.5mm headphone jack on the left side. Surprisingly, Xiaomi did keep the headphone jack here – even after getting rid of it on its recent flagships, the Mi 6 and Mi MIX 2. The top, and some of you might be surprised by this, houses an IR blaster along with a microphone. Interesting to see an IR blaster here on the Mi A1.. Front of the Mi A1 is actually somewhat plain. Of course, the sensors on the front do stand out a bit more, since it is a white front, the black version likely blends these sensors in a bit more. But you have the earpiece at the top, with the front-facing camera and other sensors. The bottom of the phone houses capacitive keys. And unlike something like the Xiaomi Mi 6, where there was a physical home buttons then the other two buttons were dots, so they could be remapped, these cannot be remapped. So you are stuck with the recents button on the left, home in the middle and back on the right, like the way Samsung does it. This isn’t the biggest issue in the world, after a few days using the Mi A1, you do get used to it, but it would be better to have the recents and back buttons swapped, since that is how literally everyone else (except Samsung, who now does on-screen buttons so the user can switch them) does it.. Here on the Mi A1, we’re looking at a full HD or 1080p resolution display. That’s not a huge surprise, seeing as Xiaomi has mostly stuck with 1080p displays over Quad HD displays, this is because it feels like Quad HD has more trade offs than full HD, and you also get better battery life with full HD. At 5.5-inches, that gives you 403 pixels per inch, which is still a pretty high pixel density, so no you won’t see any individual pixels here on the Mi A1’s display. This is also an IPS LCD display, instead of an AMOLED display. That may not be a bad thing for everyone, but an AMOLED display would definitely be preferred here. As it would allow for deeper colors, but also have better battery life.. Typically on these mid-range smartphones, which the Mi A1 arguably is, the brightness isn’t all that great. But that doesn’t appear to be much of a problem on the Mi A1. It gets plenty bright and you can see (and use) it outdoors without much of an issue. Now yes, it was tough taking pictures of the Mi A1 outdoors in direct sunlight, but we were still able to see the display without the camera in the way. So for most users out there, there won’t be any issues.. Surprisingly, there is 4GB of RAM inside the Mi A1, as well as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 625 processor. The Snapdragon 625 is known of offering up great performance and great battery life – as it has been included in the Moto Z2 Play, BlackBerry KEYone and other smartphones – and that is the case here with the Mi A1. The Snapdragon 625 performs really well inside the Mi A1, we didn’t notice any type of lagging at all, or the phone becoming slow, nor hot. Of course, part of that is due to the fact that it is running mostly stock Android.. With 4GB of RAM, you won’t need to worry about the Mi A1 running out of memory to keep your apps in memory. Most times, we had around a full gigabyte of RAM that wasn’t being used, so there is definitely plenty here. That’s not surprising since stock Android (what is running on the Mi A1) can run on as little as 512MB of RAM. There is also 64GB of storage included here, out of the box, you get around 56GB of usable storage, which is going to be plenty for most people. And even after installing all of our apps, taking loads of pictures and such, we have about 45GB of storage left. However, for those that do need more, there is a micro SD card slot that can support up to 256GB of additional storage.. Xiaomi has decided to put the fingerprint sensor on the backside of the Mi A1, which just further shows the fact that Xiaomi is very inconsistent with its fingerprint sensor placement. Some smartphones you’ll find it on the front as part of a physical home button. While others will have it on the back. The fingerprint sensor is in a good location here, on the back. It’s not up next to the camera where it is hard to reach like Samsung’s latest devices. It’s right where your finger would be resting anyways, so it is a good spot. The fingerprint sensor is nice and fast as you’d expect from Xiaomi in 2017 – or really any smartphone in 2017. It hardly ever didn’t recognize my finger, which is definitely a big deal, and important. There aren’t any fingerprint gestures on this sensor either. With Android One, you are getting the essentials and that’s it.. Here on the Mi A1, you’ll find just one speaker and that is at the bottom of the device, to the right of the USB-C port. The other side houses the 3.5mm headphone jack – which for some, this is a surprise. The speaker sounds decent, you aren’t going to be blown away by the quality of sound that comes out of this speaker, but you won’t be disappointed in it either. While some of the cheaper smartphones do often times come with “tinny” sound, that is not the case with the Mi A1, and that’s a good thing. It does get loud, so you can listen to music outside without headphones, which is also a good thing. Now when it comes to headphones, the sound will vary depending on what headphones you plug in. And of course, it is nice to have that headphone jack available, especially with other Xiaomi devices opting to ditch the headphone jack recently – like the Mi 6 and Mi MIX 2.. Xiaomi has given us the global version of the Mi A1 (MDG2 is the model number for those curious), so our thoughts on phone calls and network speeds will be based on that unit. Xiaomi has been releasing the Mi A1 in various markets over the past few weeks – which started with India. Below you’ll see the bands that are compatible with this version of the Mi A1:. 2G GSM 850, 900, 1800, 1900. 3G HSDPA 850, 900, 1900, 2100. 4G LTE band 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20, 38, 40. Now as you can see from those bands, there are plenty missing for use in the US. Which means that we were not able to fully test out the Xiaomi Mi A1 on a cellular network during our review – which is going to affect battery life as well. But we were able to connect to T-Mobile’s 2G network here in the US, and speeds were on par with other smartphones that don’t support 3G or 4G LTE on its network, so there’s nothing to worry about there.. On the phone calls side of things, calls were still able to be made with the Mi A1 here in the US. Unfortunately, there’s no support for VoLTE or WiFi Calling out of the box with the Mi A1. Which is a bit interesting considering the fact that the Mi MIX 2 did have both supported. However, it’s important to remember with the Mi A1, this is not Xiaomi’s software (other than the camera) and this is all straight from AOSP. So until Google adds native support in AOSP for both VoLTE and WiFi Calling, that likely won’t be coming to the Mi A1 or other Android One devices.. As with every review, we did run three benchmarks on the Mi A1. That includes AnTuTu, Geekbench 4 and 3D Mark. The scores we got from all three match other smartphones with similar specs (like the Moto Z2 Play, Moto G5 Plus and BlackBerry KEYone). On AnTuTu, it picked up a score of 60,582. Now yes that is towards the bottom of the leaderboard in AnTuTu’s app, but you have to remember that the leaderboard is full of flagship devices with much more powerful processors. On Geekbench 4, it picked up a single core score of 862 and a multi-core score of 4202. Finally on 3D Mark, it grabbed a score of 461. You can see the full test results in the gallery below.. There is a 3080mAh battery inside the Mi A1 here, which by Xiaomi’s standards, seems a bit small. However, with software optimization, Xiaomi was able to save a bit of cash on the battery (to keep the price low) and still offer some great battery life. Now as we mentioned before, the Mi A1 isn’t fully compatible with networks in the US, which means that we spent a good amount of time without a SIM card inside. That does affect battery life, so do keep that in mind here. But even with the SIM card in the phone, the Mi A1 just would not die – and that is definitely a good thing to have. Most users should be able to get a good 5-6 hours of on-screen time out of the Mi A1, of course, that depends on what they are doing. But stock Android does run really well on this device, and with the power sipping Snapdragon 625 running the show, you can expect incredible battery life here.. On the flip side of great battery life, is fast charging. To be specific, it’s Quick Charge 3.0. Since the Snapdragon 625 is included here, that means Quick Charge 3.0 is included as well. Which means you can go from 0 to 80% in about 35 minutes, with a compatible charger. So topping off the Mi A1 is going to be pretty quick to do. We were able to get to a full charge in just a little over an hour and a half (the first 80% is quick, but that final 20% is a trickle to keep the battery healthy). That is about on par with other smartphones we’ve reviewed with similar sized batteries and Quick Charge 3.0.. At the time of this review, the Xiaomi Mi A1 unit in our hands was running on Android 7.1.2 Nougat, build N3G47H.7.8.23 and the August 1st, 2017 security patch. Now it is worth mentioning that when we took the Mi A1 out of the box it did have an update waiting for us, which was the August 2017 security patch, but we have not received an update since. Updates should come fairly quickly to the Mi A1, since it is an Android One device, however Xiaomi will get final say before it is pushed out to the device. It will get Android 8.0 Oreo, but at this point, there is no confirmed date as to when that will happen.. Software here on the Mi A1 is basically what you would get if you compiled AOSP onto a device. There’s not much else included here, which is good for those that want stock Android on some of Xiaomi’s high-quality hardware. You will see some aspects of Xiaomi’s own skin, MIUI in here though. But that is mostly in the camera, and with the Feedback app that is included. The feedback app allows you to quickly send feedback over to Xiaomi, this is useful if you encounter an issue, or even just have a suggestion for something to add to the software – since Xiaomi is big on listening to it’s customers on its devices and software, this is not a huge surprise. Now the other aspect of MIUI here is the camera, which we’ll talk more about in the camera section.. This is Android 7.1.2 Nougat, and what is nice about this build is that Xiaomi has taken out the duplicate apps. Xiaomi has made sure not to have a Gallery app and the Google Photos app installed here. So if you are looking for a gallery app, it is indeed the Photos app. Which means that users won’t be confused at all. You do also have Google Assistant available out-of-the-box, since this is a smartphone that isn’t destined for China (it was actually released as the Mi 5X, and not as an Android One device in China). So you are able to long-press the home button and jump right into the Google Assistant and get things set up. There are no pre-installed apps here that are not Google’s own apps – and those are needed for the Xiaomi Mi A1 to be certified to run Google’s services. So this is, by all means, a bare-bones smartphone. And that is appealing to a lot of people.. The software on the Mi A1 runs just as you would expect on this hardware. It runs smoothly, without any hiccups whatsoever. Android 7.1.2 is the latest version of Android, before Android 8.0 Oreo, which the Mi A1 will receive, and hopefully soon. Android Nougat does appear to run like butter on the Snapdragon 625, and 4GB of RAM, and that’s definitely what you would expect these days.. Xiaomi has brought dual cameras to Android One with the Mi A1, and it’s definitely a welcomed feature. There are two 12-megapixel cameras on the backside, which is the same setup as the Mi 6 (but not the same sensors). With this setup, Xiaomi has also brought along its portrait mode that debuted on the Mi 6 earlier this year. Which means that the camera app is straight from MIUI, and that is the first thing you’ll notice when opening the camera. You will see all of the same modes that you’d see on the Mi MIX 2 or another MIUI-powered device from Xiaomi. This includes Panorama, Timer, Audio, Manual, Straighten, Beautify, Group Selfies, Tilt-shift, Square and HHT (aka night mode). Since the second camera is a telephoto lens, you do have the option of zooming in 2x without worrying about adding extra noise to the pictures taken in that mode.. The camera app is pretty easy to use, with the different modes being available on the left side, near the shutter button. And then you have shortcuts for flash, portrait mode and HDR on the right side. With HDR on, the camera is a bit slower to take a photo, this is mostly true with all smartphones using HDR. However, the Mi A1 is a tad bit faster than the Mi MIX 2 was in this regard. Which is actually pretty interesting, when you think about it. Portrait mode works just as you’d expect, and while Xiaomi does market it as being great for taking portraits of someone, it also works great as a bokeh mode, which we did some testing with while we had the phone, and you’ll see that in the gallery below.. Pictures taken with the Mi A1 came out pretty good. Now we did take some at night, and it did blow out the street lights and such, which is actually pretty common in auto. There is a manual mode here, but unfortunately it does not include an option to adjust the shutter speed. Which makes it a bit harder to get the perfect photo, especially at night (luckily you can download some third party apps to adjust the shutter speed and other aspects of the camera, in the Google Play Store). But overall, photos came out really good with this camera. The Mi A1 may not have the best camera – that’s still the LG V30 or Galaxy Note 8 depending on who you ask – but it is a decent enough camera to get you some great photos.. Plenty of storage – with only a 64GB option available. Looks a lot like the iPhone. Only one storage option – 32GB for a lower price tag would be optimal. Capacitive keys which cannot be remapped. As we said in the very beginning of this review, many have been asking Xiaomi to make a smartphone that is stock Android. It delivered – at the time – the highest specced Android One smartphone. Now that is arguably the Moto X4, but these are destined for different markets, obviously. Xiaomi is pretty well-known for offering up some great hardware at a low cost, and that is what the Mi A1 is. 14,999 in India, which converts to around $231 USD. That’s an absolute steal for what you get here. Obviously there are some things that we don’t like, like the large bezels, the capacitive keys and such. But for this price tag, you’re getting a whole lot of phone.. Should you Buy the Xiaomi Mi A1?. If you live in a market where the Xiaomi Mi A1 is being sold, definitely. If not, make sure that the bands needed for your carrier’s network are supported, before picking it up – there are a few different models available. The Xiaomi Mi A1 may not be the best smartphone on the market, but it is a great one for a pretty small price tag, when you have devices like the Galaxy Note 8 that are closer to $1000, like the iPhone X. So it’s definitely worth looking at as your next smartphone.. Camera Tuner App for Moto X4 Lands in the Play Store. New Report From The FCC Deems US Mobile Market “Competitive”.

The Mi A1’s clutter-free, Android One-certified experience combines elegantly with tried and tested hardware, while the dual-camera capability gives you a premium feel on a budget. Xiaomi ticks all the right boxes with this affordable but feature-rich smartphone.. Stock Android with timely updates promised. Screen is a bit washed out. Xiaomi Mi A1 price and availability Approximately £200/$250/AU$300 Available from online re-sellers Design and features Metal unibody Fingerprint scanner on the rear No water or dust resistance Display 5.5-inch IPS LCD with 1080 x 1920 resolution Screen is bright but colors appear washed out. When we talk about budget or mid-range Android smartphones, increasingly a Chinese phenomenon by the name of Xiaomi enters the conversation. Over the last few years, this company has torn up the rule book on what we'd normally expect from a smartphone that costs a third the price of an iPhone.. Xiaomi's phones have traditionally offered much of what makes the iPhone experience so appealing - excellent design, simplicity of use and a self-contained ecosystem - in a budget package.. Despite this, some Android purists have always yearned for more, citing Xiaomi's MIUI Android skin as the weak link; while it looks the part and offers impressive customization options, it comes with bloatware and bespoke optimizations which go against the grain of other Android-based handsets.. Those disgruntled individuals can now put their fears to rest, as the Mi A1 is a union between those strangest of bedfellows: Xiaomi and Google.. We say this because Xiaomi's software story has always been underpinned by putting Google's Android in the shade, and putting MIUI at the center of the galaxy of its products; MIUI has its own account system, app store and much more besides.. With the Mi A1, Xiaomi created what could become the savior of Google's beleaguered Android One program, which originally strived to offer great hardware and software to entry-level consumers in developing nations.. This program failed – ironically – because of Xiaomi's triumphant entry into the Indian market, which made a mockery of the under-powered devices which spearheaded the Android One initiative. But Xiaomi has now rebranded the Mi 5X as the A1 and placed Google's "pure" Android experience at the center of its interface.. What we have here is a potential hydrogen bomb for the budget smartphone market, because on paper this phone delivers stupendous hardware, a refined design aesthetic and a secure software experience in a package that won't break the bank.. Editor's note : While Xiaomi has a big presence in Asia and India, it has a far more limited reach in Western markets. That means you may struggle to find a store or local website stocking the firm's handsets, so you'll have to import devices into your country. With no official presence, customer support, repairs and servicing may be difficult to reach.. While the Xiaomi Mi A1 is heading up Google's renewed Android One drive, it's not officially available in the UK, US or Australia as yet. You'll have to order it from a reseller online, with prices hovering around the £200/$250/AU$300 mark.. The Solution Shop is offering the "international" version of the phone, which comes with software that supports a wide range of languages. It's also mercifully free from the kind of unnecessary bloatware that often comes installed on phones imported from China.. Note however that it doesn't support all of the network bands used in some countries, including the US, so check this before you buy, as depending on where you are and what network you’re on it might not be a good purchase.. The Mi A1 looks like a love child between the OnePlus 5 and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. The face of the phone will remind you of the Redmi Note 4, albeit with more rounded corners. On the back, it looks a lot like the OnePlus 5. It has an identical camera position and the antenna lines are also similarly designed.. Essentially this is a repackaged Xiaomi Mi 5X – itself quite a new phone – and these aforementioned similarities aren't a bad thing at all.. Criticize it for being derivative, but it is nevertheless a very well-built phone, especially when you consider its price. The construction is robust and everything feels suitably premium.. Looks aside, this is a very functional device in terms of ergonomics. It's rather svelte at 7.3mm, and is rather light too, tipping the scales at 165g. The weight is also distributed nicely and it feels great, even if you're using it one-handed.. One of the nicest things about the design is the way the chassis tapers and curves ever so gently from the sides towards the back. This creates a seamless line that runs along the spine of the handset, offering a smooth grip and great in-hand feel. On the back, there’s also a super-fast fingerprint scanner which is placed – like it is on so many other Android phones – right where your finger naturally rests. Unlike the Redmi Note 4, it has a USB Type-C connector on the bottom, flanked by a very loud single speaker and a 3.5mm jack.. On the top there's an IR blaster which allows you to control your TV or audio equipment. Below the Mi A1's 5.5-inch screen you'll find a trio of capacitive Android keys for the usual Menu, Home and Back commands. When these aren't in use they fade to black.. Sadly, there's no NFC included with the device, perhaps because in several of the emerging markets Xiaomi and Google intend to push this device, mobile payments haven't really taken off yet. It's a shame as Android Pay is becoming more and more popular, especially in the west.. The Mi A1 packs a 5.5-inch LCD display, which is a pretty standard size in the mid-range Android sector these days.. Sadly, it comes with massive bezels at the top and bottom, a fact which not only makes the device bigger than it perhaps should be (the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is roughly the same size but boasts a 5.99-inch screen) but also means it looks a little dated when compared to 2017's leading devices.. While it's perhaps unwise to expect budget phones to have jumped on the bezel-free bandwagon, Xiaomi has just announced the Redmi 5 which will combine a low price with a massive screen, while other Chinese companies such as Elephone and Maze are already producing devices with minimal bezels.. The screen itself is bright, but colors look muted and contrast isn't awe-inspiring. Everything looks a little washed out, even when compared to other handsets in the budget sector. It's hard to complain too much when you're paying so little, but the screen definitely could have been better.. Next Page Battery life and camera.

Xiaomi Mi A1 (Android One) review: Almost the perfect budget phone. 2017/10/13 10:00am PST Oct 13, 2017. Android One Mi A1 News Phone Reviews Reviews Xiaomi / MIUI. 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design and materials 5 Display 6 Battery 7 Storage and wireless 8 Reception 9 Camera 10 Performance 11 Software 12 Conclusion. Xiaomi phones always have the same problem. While the company's devices have generally great specifications and design for the price, the software experience is usually not very good. If you've read one of our Xiaomi device reviews , or used one of the company's phones yourself, you probably know what I'm talking about.. All of Xiaomi's phones and tablets ship with MIUI, a heavily modified version of Android that has countless problems. Some of these include Bluetooth connectivity bugs, terrible notification handling, and over-the-top power management that can outright break notifications for many apps. Jordan went in depth about MIUI's issues here , if you're interested in details.. Because Xiaomi's devices are mostly just inhibited by the software, people have been asking the company for years to make a phone with stock (or near-stock) Android. Last month, that finally became a reality, when Xiaomi announced its first Android One device - the Mi A1.. So how is a Xiaomi phone without MIUI? It's pretty fantastic.. 5.5" 1080p IPS with Corning Gorilla Glass. 64GB storage with hybrid SIM/MicroSD slot. 12MP wide-angle + 12MP telephoto lens with 2x Optical zoom and 10x digital zoom, dual-tone LED flash. FDD-LTE / TDD-LTE | WCDMA | GSM | VoLTE, Dual SIM and dual standby. Android 7.1.2 (upgrade to Oreo before the end of 2017). This looks and feels like a phone twice the price. It's stock Android 7.1.2, and Oreo is promised before the end of the year. The Snapdragon 625 processor is plenty fast. You might be able to squeeze two days out of one charge.. Like many budget phones, the A1 has problems with color balance and low light. The navigation buttons are capacitive instead of on-screen, and they're in the wrong order. There is no NFC on this phone. You still can't buy this in the United States.. Xiaomi usually does a great job of designing and building phones, even if the result isn't entirely original. The Mi A1 looks and feels like a phone twice the price. But like many of Xiaomi's previous phones, this device looks very much like an Apple phone - in this case, the. It has the same antenna bands that run across the top and bottom, the same rounded aluminum back, the same dual cameras, and even some of the same color options. The A1 is just a hair thicker than the 7 Plus, coming in at 7.3mm (the 7 Plus is 7.1mm).. To be honest, the lack of originality doesn't bother me in the slightest. If you don't want an iPhone look-alike, there are plenty of other options out there. But by copying most of the iPhone's design philosophy, Xiaomi has made a very good looking phone for the price.. There are some notable differences though, the first of which is one of my few complaints with this phone - the capacitive navigation keys. Just like ASUS and (until recently) Samsung, capacitive navigation buttons have been a staple of Xiaomi's phones for years. The A1's nav buttons aren't awful by any means (at least they light up), except that the overview/back buttons are in the wrong order compared to Nexus/Pixel/stock Android devices. I always prefer software navigation, but this only took a few hours of getting used to.. Moving onto the bottom edge, we see another departure from the iPhone - the headphone jack. Thankfully, the dumb trend of removing headphone jacks hasn't penetrated the mid/low-range phone market for the most part. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I played a sampling of music on both the A1 and my first-gen Google Pixel to compare audio quality. On the A1, a very slight hiss was audible, but audio quality was pretty much identical otherwise.. Left: 5-inch Google Pixel; Right: Xiaomi Mi A1. The left side of the phone only has the SIM card tray. Like many international phones, the tray can hold either 1-2 nanoSIM cards, or one nanoSIM and one microSD. I tested dual SIMs with AT&T and Project Fi, and I didn't have any problems switching between one or the other.. On the right side, you'll find the volume rocker and power button. The power button is positioned below the volume rocker, which I found a bit annoying coming from a Google Pixel (where the power button is above the volume). Both buttons have the same coating, so it might be tricky to tell them apart in the dark or in your pocket. These are fairly minor complaints though, and like the capacitive navigation buttons, you'll get used to this after a while.. The top of the phone has an IR blaster, another feature that Xiaomi regularly includes on its phones. It worked just fine in my testing, and I was able to use this app to control my TV and its accompanying soundbar. Why aren't IR blasters on flagship phones?. The A1's back, as mentioned above, looks very much like the back of the iPhone 7. It's covered in an aluminium finish, and my model has a very nice-looking Rose Gold color. A fingerprint scanner sits at the top middle, and in my experience, it seemed about as fast as the one on my Pixel. The pair of 12MP cameras is positioned above the scanner, with the flash at the very top-left corner.. One feature that is missing from the A1 is NFC. This is definitely a shame, but I don't use Android Pay often, so I didn't miss it too much. But that's pretty much the only feature missing from this phone, besides an FM radio.. In summary, this is a very well-built phone. That shouldn't be surprising, considering many of Xiaomi's recent devices have been great as far as hardware/design goes. The A1 isn't bezelless, and it doesn't have a fancy 18:9 screen, but you have to remember that this is a budget phone. Most phones in this price range in the United States are mostly (or entirely) plastic and usually thicker. The Moto G5/G5 Plus looks like an ugly slab compared to the A1.. As you may have noticed in the specs sheet, the A1 has a 5.5" 1080p display. 450nit, so you shouldn't have any problems at all reading content outdoors. It's an IPS LCD panel, so you won't get the amazing contrast and colors that AMOLED screens offer, but that should be expected at this price point.. Overall, I don't have any complaints with the screen. It has great viewing angles, and contrast seemed fine. In my opinion, 1080p is still fine for a 5.5" screen, and 1440p is out of the question at this price range.. One of the most impressive aspects of the A1, in my opinion, was the battery life. This might not be a surprise, considering the Snapdragon 625 processor is great when it comes to power consumption. The 3,000mAh battery isn't particularly large, but when combined with the SD625, you get a phone that can easily last a day or two - even with moderate to heavy use.. I usually hate writing about battery life, because everyone uses their phone differently, so battery life can vary from person to person. My daily phone usage consists of checking various social media apps (Twitter, Instagram, etc), reading and responding to emails with Gmail/Inbox, and watching videos (YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu mostly). With this pattern, I could usually get two full days out of a single charge, with around six hours of screen-on time.. Even if you use more performance-heavy apps on your phone, like 3D games, you should still be able to last a day with the A1. It has plenty of battery to spare.. The Mi A1 has a whopping 64GB of internal storage, plus one of the SIM card slots can be used for microSD cards. I didn't have any problems with using microSD cards on this phone, and Android's adoptable storage mode worked great. I think most people will be content with the 64GB of included storage, but if you still need more space, the option is there.. As far as wireless protocols go, the A1 supports. 802.11a/b/g/n/ac (2.4/5Ghz) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2. I found that the A1 had slightly worse Wi-Fi reception than my Google Pixel, but it was only noticeable in spots with bad coverage. In one specific room of my home, my Pixel can usually hang on to a weak signal, but the A1 will switch to cellular data pretty quick. But this is a worst-case scenario, so I don't think most people will have issues here.. Bluetooth is one aspect of Xiaomi phones that has usually been terrible. In his Mi 6 review , Jordan noted that Bluetooth devices repeatedly disconnected, and headsets/earbuds will either lose connection during playback or fail to connect in the first place. He has encountered similar issues on other Xiaomi devices. Thankfully, I haven't had any problems with Bluetooth on the A1. My Android Wear smartwatch stays connected, and streaming music to the various BT speakers works just fine. This is likely thanks to the stock Android software, which doesn't have any of MIUI's usual software "optimizations.". There is always one major downside to using phones in regions they aren't sold - cellular reception. This is because different countries/regions use different cellular frequencies , and phones usually only support the frequencies used in the areas they sold in. The A1 will be sold in more than 30 countries , so it supports more frequencies than the usual China/India-only devices from Xiaomi.. I live in the United States, where the A1 is not sold, so naturally I don't get the full cellular capabilities as someone would in a country where it's sold. I tried both AT&T and Project Fi (which uses T-Mobile's network) SIM cards, and I stayed at 4G most of the time. But I also encountered occasional dead spots, where the dominant frequency covering the area wasn't being picked up by the A1. That's certainly better than my Mi 4c, where I max out at 3G, but it's still not ideal.. Testing the Mi A1's dual-SIM functionality. Again, I encountered these problems because I live in the US, and the Mi A1 doesn't have the required bands to operate at full capacity here. If you live in a region where Xiaomi is officially selling the A1, you shouldn't have any problems with cellular reception. But if you're in the US looking for a cheap budget phone to import, you'll need to cross-check your carrier's bands with those supported by the A1 , and you can forget about LTE.. The Mi A1 has a dual-camera setup on the back, as is becoming common with smartphones these days. One of them is a 12MP wide-angle lens, and the other is a 12MP telephoto lens. While I wouldn't call the A1's photos flagship-quality, the A1 does take decent pictures. I've included a few below for you to take a look at (note: all of them were taken with HDR off).. The A1's camera has two main problems - color balance and low-light. As long as you have a decent amount of light, picture quality is good. In some of the above pictures, like the one of my shoes and the one pointed at the sky, there is plenty of detail with sharp contrast. But once you try to take pictures in dimly-lit areas, noise starts to become visible.. In all the pictures above, there is a noticeable lack of color balance. Dimly-lit areas are often completely washed out, like in the last photo in the above gallery. The camera app does provide an HDR mode, which helps a bit. You can see two examples below (click for full resolution).. Left: Without HDR; Right: With HDR. In summary, I think most people will be happy with the A1's photos. In the right conditions, you can capture great pictures, even with HDR off. Just make sure you turn off the 'Beautify' feature first.. If you're not familiar with mobile chipsets, the A1's Snapdragon 625 chipset is very good. Other phones with the same processor include the Moto G5 Plus, Moto Z Play, and Redmi Note 4. On Geekbench 4, the A1 scored 871 on single-core and 4239 on multi-core (detailed results here ). The phone received a score of 63,132 in AnTuTu 3DBench, and 464 in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme test.. Like most other phones with the SD625 chip, the Mi A1. delivers great performance for average tasks while keeping battery usage low. The performance difference between the A1 and my Google Pixel in real-world usage is marginal at best. Apps are quick to open, and multi-tasking works great thanks to the 4GB of RAM. Only in power-intensive tasks like 3D gaming is there a noticeable performance drop.. In summary, the Mi A1 is a very fast phone, and you won't encounter any slowdowns in normal (non-gaming) use.. Finally, we come to what most people would consider the Mi A1's main attraction. This is the reason the A1 has been hyped up by Android enthusiasts. Instead of Xiaomi's usual buggy MIUI skin, the Mi A1 has completely stock Android. This phone is part of Google's Android One program (hence the 'A1' name), where the company works with manufacturers to create phones with stock Android and speedy updates. Google doesn't directly update these phones, but it does work directly with the makers (Xiaomi, in this case) to make sure they go out quickly.. My review unit is running Android 7.1.2 with the September 1 security patch. There are a few very minor tweaks to Android, like a persistent notification when you have headphones connected (not sure why) and a 'Mi Services' section of the Settings app that contains switches for sending anonymous usage data to Xiaomi. The camera app is also from Xiaomi, but Android One phones almost always have custom camera applications. The only included app is 'Mi Remote,' which you can choose to install or not when you setup the phone.. The included launcher is a hybrid between the AOSP and Google Now/Pixel launchers. There's a rounded search bar at the top of the first home screen, and swiping left reveals the Google Feed. Swiping up on the dock reveals all your installed apps, with a search available at the top.. Honestly, there's not much else to say about the software. It's nearly identical to what you would find on a Nexus or Pixel phone, minus Google's exclusive software features. Google promises the phone will get Android Oreo before the end of the year and Android P shortly after its released.. The Xiaomi Mi A1 is a very good phone, if you take it for what it is. This is not a spiritual successor to the Nexus lineup, as I've seen some people describe it as. It's just a very good mid-range phone, with an excellent software experience, a good camera, fantastic build quality, and a promise of quick updates.. In the grand scheme of things, my complaints with this phone are very minor. The capacitive navigation buttons are annoying at first, but you get used to them after a few hours. The camera has issues with color balance and low light, but so does almost every budget phone. My biggest complaint with this phone isn't with the hardware or software - it's the availability.. While the A1 will be sold in dozens of countries worldwide, the United States is not among them. That's a massive shame, considering most of the good Android budget phones in the US are made by Motorola, and that company has been pretty awful at software updates lately.. If you are in a country where the Mi A1 is sold, I would definitely recommend it. Xiaomi has made an excellent device with Google's help, and I hope it's the first of many Android One phones from the company..

Thx for the fast answer! This was the main reason i refrained from buying it so far. (Living in Germany, but Czech Republic is not far away). That isn't spyware it is part of MIUI and deals with updates, error reports and usage statistics, it is not on Android One models.. Too bad they't can just put the Moto G5 Plus' modem in this thing and have all the bands we need in the US.. Capacitive navigation buttons is a plus for me. But how can you manage with that right side back button?!?!?. Some people prefer it on the right. I personally don't, but I know plenty of people who do.. And it's certainly not a deal breaker, since either configuration is easily adjusted to in a day or two.. Not OP, but I have a Mi Max 2 that has the same button setup. I use the back button way more often than the multitask button.. For me it's logic that the back button is closer to my thumb since it's easier to use that way. I even had it placed like that on my LG G4.. Samsung Galaxy users (who make up an enormous chunk of the Android market) have been doing it for many years now. Honestly, I laughed when I read personal preference stuff like button layout and capacitive vs. software button being passed off as universal negatives.. its an advantage for left handed like me :P. Got a Galaxy S7 Edge now and before that a Note 3. How do you manage to drive on the other side of the road?. Oh please, it's not like they hack all of the navigation buttons and replace it with one single Draconian button or worse, a confusing navigation gestures.. Unless your screen is extra wide, like latest phones from Samsung, LG, or Google (XL only), on-screen buttons are a complete and utter waste of screen space.. Screen are not waste when in app, unless it Sony, they never bother to hide nav bar lol.. I have a Sony Z2, and I ordered the Mi A1 as a replacement since it is aging. I prefer separate buttons like on my Xperia S, especially when bezels are so huge and unused. But I prefer some waste of space rather than hiding buttons that sometimes do no show up when needed or make you touch something wrong since it can be buggy.. Well, Im glad that I didn't encounter any problem with navigation bar, and I hope many OEM will follow S8 navigation bar that have same function like 3D Touch. I prefer full because I like to watching video and gaming. And latest Sony phone totally waste the screen and phone with huge bezel.. Yeah, it is a waste, for sure!. I would consider getting this for my father as an upgrade to Galaxy S5, but he's on Verizon. Too bad it probably won't work, and I won't be able to find one in the U.S. Moto X4 Android One is available in the US. Xiaomi also has own remote software https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duokan.phone.remotecontroller. I use it with my Samsung TV. The Mi Max 2 is just a glorified remote these days.. I wonder how they fit a headphone jack into "smaller", midrange devices but they can't fit it into giant 6" flagship devices?. There's no room for a headphone jack when every last bit of spare space in your phone is full of "courage".. Lol, courage has one of the lowest densities, so you are lucky you get a battery with the amount of courage Apple manages to fit into a thin, beautifully crafted device.. No headphone jack on the Mi Mix 2, either.. I've read somewhere that Mexico (a supported Mi A1 market) uses the same LTE bands as the US; has anyone had success importing a Mexican Mi A1 to the US and seeing LTE?. I think Movistar uses LTL B2 (1900 PCS) frecuency which is not supported by this phone.. Mexico uses bands 2 and 4 but not 12 or 17 so it wouldn't have full support in the US but would still work.. Weird that they uploaded the video already on youtube but not on here. It's usually the other way around. Maybe because Zachary was too hyped about it that he reviewed it fast asf.. Very unusual for AP, especially since the V30 is a hyped device.. Prices in Europe are Greece: 284€, Netherlands: 260€, Spain: 228€ and in Poland, Hungary and Russia for the equivalents of 300€, 240€ and 280€ respectively.. In Europe you can buy it from shops like GearBest for the equivalent of 170/190 Euro.. +taxes, since they come from Hongkong. Nope, at least for Italy the website has a "special" shipping method that ships with DHL and that has not additional taxes or custom fees.. In Ireland with DHL if you buy something from China they make sure you pay VAT @23% + their own bs fee of 9€ or something around that.. Yeah it's the same for Italy for *usual* shipments (directly from China to italy) lol but with that shipping method Gearbest manages to make the shipment follow a way around different European countries that basically makes it sure not to pay taxes lol. The Irish should start taxing giant corporations instead of messing around with end users. 1 year and you are complaining? Here at Chile we have 3 months, and, curiously, all the things start to fail at 3 months and 1 day.. Anyway, the fact that in Chile the legal warranty is a joke doesn't mean that I can't complain if a website gives me only one year of warranty where the standard legal warranty is of 2 years.. Depends on your country and shipping method.. I'm fine with capacitive buttons even though I prefer on-screen, but I hate them being in the wrong order.. I have to second that, the only reason I'm using the capacitive buttons on my OnePlus 3 is because I can set them up how I want, in the right order.. There's no right or wrong order, most phones I've used have the back button on the right hand side so that's the "right" order for me.. Doesn't matter how many badly made devices with backwards buttons you've used. The AOSP designated order for 5+ years now is correct. Any other order is at the discretion of OEMs, but is incorrect.. Then reading that it is not coming to NA. mom needs a new phone as her Nexus 4 craps out and restarts a few times a week, this was looking nice. Maybe a Moto G5 or something..... Yeah, I'd recommend the Moto G5 or one of its many cousins. Cheap and great value for the money. If you're into good looks, the Moto Series is not really for you. I'm not sure why, but Moto phones just don't give that attractive vibe to me.. Waiting for the honor 7x for my mother. All Android One's (along with Nexus, Pixel, Google Play Edition, vanilla Android devices) should have global LTE chipsets.. They should but it's not really needed since most Android One phones aren't meant for the US. It costs them more money to implement it. Thank the modem manufacturer (in most cases Qualcomm) for being greedy about that. I agree that it should be standard on all flagship phones but on budget phones every penny counts.. It already has a ton of bands (more than a typical phone) just none are for the US. It actually has two US LTE bands: 4 and 5, UTMS: band 2. Even with that, it still is a poor choice in the USA or Canada.. Snapdragon 630, NFC, software buttons and most importantly of all global LTE bands like the Mi Mix 2!. The Mi Mix 2 has a SD835. Great phone, too, other than MIUI.. Kinda sounds like you want a Moto X4. Fps has to be on the back for me.. Would be stellar if Google offered a third Pixel. SD 660, 3GB DDR4 RAM and same camera as Pixel 2. I think the 660 has similar ISP as 835. To keep the price down a little lol.. Heck, I'd love a $180 Pixel 2 with SD 450, 2GB RAM and 32GB of storage (or 16GB with MicroSD support). It could also have a plastic shell instead of the metal and glass combo for further cost savings. The display, camera, speakers, waterproofing and all the rest would stay the same. No idea how much the camera would suffer from having a SD 450 instead of the 835, though.. "and they're in the wrong order." Hehe, no :). " The performance difference between the A1 and my Google Pixel in real-world usage is marginal at best. " Sorry I'm french I'm having trouble understanding this sentence and google trad didn't really help. Does it mean that there is a very small difference bettween mi A1 performances and a Google Pixel performances ?. Hey Corbin, the battery is 3080 not 3000 mAh , please correct this and include A/B system partition on it. I think "marginal" is like the margins of a paper - quite small.. I think we missed the sarcasm. Ia the storage UFS or eMMC?. It does have an FM radio. You need to enter the hidden menu (*#*#6484#*#*) and it's at the bottom. It only works with a headset plugged in, as that's the antenna.. But its a testing mode and its like a hack.., Maybe sideloading 5x's FM apk might work, but not sure.... I dont see why Capacitive navigation buttons is bad thing...i have Xiaomi and i love mine!. Also why not being availabe in US is bad thing? Do you know how many phones are not availabe in my country. Then you have to put it as bad on alot of phones.. We're a U.S.-based site with mainly U.S. So this is something we stipulate in reviews.. Capacitive navigation buttons have their advantages, but there are a lot of disadvantages too:. Usually not customizable in any way. You are stuck with the way they are positioned and designed. The only thing you might be able to do is to assign which button does what (like on OnePlus devices). Cannot be hidden in cases the developer decided that the content of the screen is more important (like videos and games). Use space that can be used for screen or other, more useful things (like speakers or sensors). Can be damaged over time (wear off). Can be clicked accidentally because they are still available in games. On some devices, they don't have a light, so in the dark, you don't see them, and so you might miss clicking the one you intend to click (click on wrong button or empty space). There's no indication on what you clicked in some devices, which is poor experience. Video capturing doesn't include them, so if you want to send someone what you do in an app, you can't show that you've clicked navigation buttons.. Why cant they simply use Dots on Capacitive keys instead of forcing users like Samsung once did???!!!???. It oddly depends on the lineup. Their last generations of "Mi" phones (flagships) have dots and a toggle to decide which button order you want while the budget "RedMi" line (and also this one by extension) get the classic buttons and no toggle. Really weird decission on their part.. Yeah once I saw MI5 dots I really thought future of RedMi phone will change to adapt it.., but sadly it didn't happen. Also, it seems Google couldn't get much hold on A1's hardware.., Else Google wouldn't have allowed it.... Well the Mi 5 / Mi 5S / Mi 6 all have dots for capacitive buttons.... Capacitive buttons >>>>> Crappy, poorly implemented software buttons by Google.. Also there is no wrong order.. Why does he mention about the capacitive navigation buttons, which can be switched between native Android type or custom type. They, are customizable even in Mi phones. Simply, it's not even a point to discuss in phone reviews.. He didn't test the performance of the camera properly. The main feature is the DoF mode of the camera, which he didn't discuss.. You can't switch between software and capacitive navigation buttons on stock Android.. I wonder why did they change the LTE indicator.... Bluetooth Problems? MIUI is one of the Most Stable ROMs and i love it. You can buy this phone officially in Europe, it means it acts as any other European phone when it comes to cellular conectivity.. I hate you are calling it "wrong order" when the back and recent buttons are reversed. There is no right order only just because Google did that differently. With this, you can call ony other OEM's ROM wrong because it's not 1:1 copy of AOSP.. Yes, and any other oem would be/are wrong if/when they don't put the buttons in the standard aosp order, as has been the case for over half a decade now. Just because a lot of people bought crappy Samsung devices for so many years doesn't make their button order not wrong.. Yes, there is a right order, and this is not it. Have you ever used a computer?. Whatever is in the AOSP is the right way IMO.. I wish it had the google camera app and swaped recent and back buttons. Other than that looks like a really solid phone for me, hopefully sources aren't as bad as usually and custom rom makers do a good job.. a) wrong order is you opinion, put all buttons in that order one of the first things i do.. b) not available in the us makes it "not so good" so you really think the U.S. are the center of the world, history will soon proof otherwise but that's another topic LOL. c) i have 6 phones with nfc and 1 without, never miss it while i'm aware that some. are using payment platforms that need it, only that all my cards have an nfc chip and i can't see one single reason why i should use my phone to to do the same, especially considering all the downsides like non-compatibility with xposed and a lot more.. of course many things are about personal preference so your opinion is as valid as mine and vice versa, only difference is that in a serious review bias should be replace with objectivity and availability in the U.S. for example is not a criteria to judge the hardware and the software which a review should.. if a piece of HW is outstanding, people have always found ways to get a hold of them.. No, button order is not opinion. It's been set "back button on left" as standard by Google for going on 5 years now.. Yeah but the other supposed wrong order has been used by hundreds of millions of users for almost a decade now.. One single reason to use your phone instead of your cards is when you forget to take those cards with you.. The availability of the A1 didn't impact my opinion of the phone itself. Like I said in the conclusion, it's still a fantastic phone, I just wish it was available in more countries. I went into detail about it's performance in the US because I live here, as do many of our readers.. If you don't need NFC, then obviously the lack of it is not a problem to you. While I personally don't mind that this phone doesn't support FM radio (at least officially), someone else might base their phone purchase around the feature.. Yes, the buttons are in the wrong order.. Nice phone, I’d rather see this than the Moto X4 in the US, or both.. Miui is a great experience, actually Mr. Author you sir might not have had enough time to use and explore the opportunity this OS provides.. Has anyone with this phone (or other) tried Adoptable Storage? Just wondering if it works ok over the long term with Mi A1. Zenfone 3 Zoom is only slightly thicker (0.7mm) but has a 5Ah battery for the best battery life of any current phone, and is better in nearly every other way as well, and is currently only slightly more expensive, and has already been available including in the US for 5 months now.. This phone seems decent, and will likely have more software updates (the Asus is doing pretty good on 7.1.1 with July security, but who knows when or if it'll get any more updates), but other than that doesn't seem to have much to distinguish it even from phones like the $200 ZTE Blade V8 Pro which I got nearly 9 months ago (and it has NFC, if you care about that).. And both the above mentioned devices have the keys in the correct order.. All ZF3 series will get Oreo before 1st half of 2018. ZTE only gives full OS updates to its Axon line. Otherwise, they stay on the same Android version it shipped with.. Does Asus/ZTE have Android One devices?. 10.or G is way better than Mi A1 in each and every aspect. Checkout specifications of 10.or G and you will be shocked!. Corbin, you missed out a feature, that no other phone has apart from the pixels as of this writing... This one really an average phone having limited features in terms of UI like... Double tap, snap shot shortcut, gestures, call recording, average camera n really a budget class mobile which you never hv to buy this...on 15k we are getting maximum options like opportunity vivo n Samsung. Over all not as per expectation.. Well, that's because it is NOT SUPPOSED TO have them. Those who want "gimmicks" in their phone can look elsewhere. It's for: Android purists, people who are concerned with having monthly security updates, raw Android experience, and smooth, lag-free performance which does not worsen over time.. It is good for these money but I would not buy it. Seemed a little bit bigger that I want and screen quality is not enough for me.. I live in India and I have bought the phone. It is a pretty good experience. The only thing I don't like is that there is no fast charging capabilities.. Thanks for sharing such an amazing review, planning to purchase mia1 , the best thing i like about this device is no miui , finally xiaomi introduces pure android device thats why i am going for this device but many users are saying that camera quality is not that great but as per review i will go for this device, thanks for sharing such an amazing article , keep up the good work like this http://www.mygadgetreviewer.com/2017/10/facebook-oculus-go-virtual-reality-vr.html. It's easier to press the button when you have the phone in the right hand.. It's good phone but if it is available within 10 to 12 thousand range then it would occupy a huge share in android market. Can i get a trial unit of this beautifully designed Mi A1 its black colour is looking gorgeous. Why is it Android One, yet still doesn't have Android O ?. I remember that in the past, a Android One device even got the final new Android version before Nexus did.. Thats a great question and an indication that updates will not be Google or Xiaomi ´s priorities.... I though Android One devices get the updates about as soon as Nexus and Pixels do, at least for the final versions. This one will get by the end of December?. Can you also please publish video samples taken from the camera?. I've A1 in india and using the same sim which I've used previously in Nexus 5..Signal is very fluctuating.. What about the Wi-Fi Range, can you give me your opinion on that? I have a HTC 10 which has very poor Wi-Fi and bluetooth range and it´s driving me nuts, I am thinking about selling it and getting this one instead but if Wi-Fi sucks as well I have to think in other options... But there are complaints being posted on that front as well in xiaomi forums.... Hope to see high end phones with Android One so Google controls updates. Pixel lacks too many things like SD, wireless charging, etc.. The promise of android one is little blurry at this point. Last month the sept security patch was delayed and we received it on 29th sept. This month still no news on the oct security patch and guess what Nokia 6 is reported to be receiving it. Still a lot to be proven about this Xiaomi-Google collab.. I disagree, Oreo update for the A1 must be in quite an advanced state for them to promise it until the end of the year. People that bought the phone report they got 2 updates in 30 days. That is not bad by any means.. For a professional (?) reviewer, I find it very disappointing that you constantly ram in your very specific personal taste. Who are you to define what is the "correct" button order? Separate navigation buttons is a pro, not a con at all, it's always available for use, and doesn't cheat 10% of your screen vertical resolution.. We write reviews and get paid for them, so Corbin is a professional reviewer by that definition. Because it's his profession to be a writer. Reviews are a blend of subjectivity and objectivity, because they're written by humans. You want raw data, go to Anandtech. Reviews from outlets like AP use subjectivity because a review is about our experience with a phone. So yeah, we're going to have our "very specific personal taste.". We can have this softkeys vs. capacitive debate all day, but I doubt you'll change anyone's mind.. Finally, Corbin didn't define the correct button order. Hey man, if you want a product description click the link at the bottom of the article. Reviews are inherently biased, and that's just fine, in fact, it's kinda the whole point.. Millions of people read our reviews every month, and they come here because they value our insights and opinions. Corbin did an excellent job with this review and spent many hours preparing it. I find your tone and message questioning whether he is a professional to be insulting and immature.. Bet your mom would be ashamed to see you talking to other people like this. Go learn some manners and don't bother commenting again until you do.. I really wish that the capacitive navigation buttons are customisable like the ones in xiaomi Mi series so we could just switch the order easily, but looking at the design, I won't be too certain about it... Nice articles i liked it :) your reviews are awesome. Reviewers are supposed to be objective, while this guy keeps comparing mi a1 with his pixel. Buttons are not like pixel's, bang! bad point. FYI, all Samsung phones (and they are a lot more then pixels and nexii out there) and also other brands have the back button on the right. It seems silly to be different, to be honest. Next, the buttons on the right side are not like pixel's (again) as if pixels are now the reference in the smartphone market (how many pixels sold Google? Hmmmm... not that many, ok) and the capacitive buttons are suddenly a downside (what?) because they're not (same story) software buttons like the pixel's. Go review a pixel, you seem well qualified for this.. Reviews are actually meant to be subjective, since they vary, and tell a person's experience with the device. To each his own, and you can either agree or disagree depending on the experience you have with the device in question.. My way or the highway, nice motto for a website valuing its readers. These guys are so precious, why read opinions, you might as well close the comments section. Plenty of fish in the water.. Does it accept all formats of sd card or anly vFat format like other xiaomi phones???. Miui is the best software for android... i can not understand how you could criticize it. The MIUI Version also get updates.. so i don`t see any pro for this phone compared to an redmi note 4 s, which is a lot better in battery life. CAUTION: This review will only briefly mention it but the audio output on this phone is very very bad if you have sensitive IEMs with an impedance value of 32ohms or less. Constant hissing will be present on all audio coming out of that 3.5mm jack and totally ruin your immersion in your music, and especially so in your podcasts. Very poor from Xiaomi, and the are still no kernel sources released 4 months from the phones release.
