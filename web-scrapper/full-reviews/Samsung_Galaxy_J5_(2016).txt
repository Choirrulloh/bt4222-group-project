more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. posted by Luis D.. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. Introduction When we think of Samsung , it's usually the flagships like the Galaxy S7 edge and Galaxy Note 5 that immediately come to mind. However, it's not really these flashy and expensive models that sell by the buckets. Rather, it's the less design- and specs-intense ones from budget series like the Galaxy J and Galaxy A that make up the bulk of Samsung's smartphone shipments. Despite enjoying top priority at Samsung's manufacturing lines, it's not easy to be a Galaxy J these days, as first-time and budget-minded smartphone buyers in developing markets are wooed by numerous low-margin vendors that supposedly offer more value for less money. Can the new Galaxy J5 (2016) convince you to pick it up instead of a comparably priced handset by the brands above? Well, we'll have to see about that! Design An elegant smartphone whose budget origins aren't immediately obvious. With its symmetric and tastefully sculpted metal frame, the J5 (2016) is worthy of the Galaxy branding. While the removable plastic back panel does reveal the handset's cost-efficient origins, nothing about the construction feels like an afterthought. The handset feels tightly put together and reasonably comfortable in the palm with its sculpted edges and balanced weight. We think the power and volume keys are placed a tad too high, but we can live with this. The keys handle fine, and so does the Home button below the screen , which doesn't contain a fingerprint sensor, but it can swiftly launch the camera app in two quick presses. True to Samsung form, the Home button is accompanied by capacitive keys – 'Menu' on the left and 'Back' on the right. Also of note is the presence of an actual LED flash next to the selfie camera. Very few smartphones offer that, and we'll tell you more about it later. On the back panel resides a bumpy camera with a single LED flash on the right, and speaker holes placed to the left. The latter looks out of place, but the decision probably has more to do with sound quality than aesthetics. Below, we find a mic, a microUSB port, and – praise the skies – a 3.5mm jack. This completes the Galaxy J5 (2016)'s favorable, but not class-leading appearance. Display Despite its low resolution, the screen offers very good image quality. A 720p-resolution screen like the one on the Galaxy J5 (2016) doesn't sound very compelling in the age of ubiquitous 1080p screens. But tell you what, this 5.2-inch Super AMOLED looks surprisingly good. Image quality is sharp and clear, while the various display modes let you quickly switch between color-accurate or larger-than-life hues. Although colors are close to home, the screen does exhibit unremarkable contrast, with whites being brighter than needed and causing a slightly washed-out look. The maximum brightness output isn't strong enough for comfortable usage in bright sunlight, and different viewing angles tend to skew the colors. Still, the J5 (2016)'s screen performs admirably for the price point.. 5.74 x 2.85 x 0.32 inches. 145.8 x 72.3 x 8.1 mm. 5.91 x 2.99 x 0.34 inches. 150 x 76 x 8.65 mm. 5.79 x 2.86 x 0.31 inches. 147 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm. 5.96 x 3 x 0.32 inches. 151.3 x 76.3 x 8.15 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

We have been trying for weeks to get a Samsung Galaxy repaired, which is under warranty. They wanted a copy of the bill of sale; we've E-Mailed and Faxed this with a covering letter and called them many times; However, the mailing label they promised to send so we can ship them the phone never came. Many phone calls were made but we were "cut off' during the last hour long call. The agent who apparently hung up on us while claiming he was getting a supervisor was Hendrick, ID@ 10106783.

(Posts: 165; Member since: 16 Oct 2013). posted on 20 Jun 2016, 16:45. Try to explain how can the j5 make a 6.0 score and the redmi note 3 a 6.5 and the m3 note a 7.0. No, i don't own a xiaomi or meizu. You can be harsh all you like. but if 6.5 is a fair score for the redmi note 3 then the 6s/plus should get around 8 and the j5 2016, less than 4. I don't wanna swear and shout iphonearena with a lot of exclamation marks but your reviews are laughable compared to gsmarena. You are probably being paid, us readers have no way of confirming or denying that but try to be a little more discreet doing that.. (Posts: 9; Member since: 27 Oct 2013). posted on 27 Jun 2016, 09:07. Where I live, the J5 (2016) is the cheapest phone at 220,- euro. Nexus 5x, Redmi Note 3 and Honor 5X are more expensive and they are 5.5" phones except the nexus. I would rather compare the J5 to Moto G or G4, HTC Desire 626 or huawei GR3. These are all 5" phones and the same price range. If you compare the J5 to the phones above, than it performs much better. The Moto G4 is maybe the best but if you're fan of AMOLED than it's a easy choce.. (Posts: 2; Member since: 28 Jan 2014). posted on 30 Jun 2016, 18:45.

Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) Smartphone Review. Florian Wimmer ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 05/18/2016. Android ARM Smartphone Touchscreen. Plastic before, metal now: The new edition of the Galaxy J5 aims to make a higher-quality impression. However, the inner values have remained mostly the same. Is that enough for a successful update?.

The best alternatives for the Samsung Galaxy J5 Samsung rolls out update for the Galaxy J5. For the original German review, see here .. Samsung has sent the update of its lower mid-range Galaxy J5 model to our test lab. The new handset carries the article number SM-J510FN. A dual-SIM version also exists, but we are testing a single-SIM model. Unlike the run-of-the-mill polycarbonate used in the predecessor, this time a metal bezel adds more stability and an elegant touch to the handset. Three colors, a strong battery and a slightly larger screen are further differences compared with the predecessor. The recommended price has also skyrocketed: 279 Euros (~$315) is not exactly a bargain. In this article, we aim to find out whether this is enough to still keep up in the highly competitive low-cost mid-range.. The competition is diverse in any case: For example, how big are the differences to the more expensive Galaxy A5 or the former Galaxy J5 ? Honor's 5X price cutter is also a serious opponent, and Acer's Liquid Z630S and LG's K10 compete for customers' attention.. Articles with further information to the Galaxy J5:. Update 11/06/2017: a new firmware has been released. Details can be found in the software section.. The review of the Successor is available here: Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) SM-J530F.. Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 MSM8916 Qualcomm Adreno 306. Test device courtesy of Samsung Deutschland. (download rating image as PNG or SVG ). Galaxy J5 2016 ( Galaxy J Series ). 5.2 inch 16:9, 1280 x 720 pixel 282 PPI, capacitive touchscreen, AMOLED, glossy: yes. 1 USB 2.0, Audio Connections: 3.5 mm headset jack, Card Reader: micro-SD max. 128GB, NFC, Sensors: Bewegungssensor, AnnÃ¤herungssensor, Lagesensor, USB OTG. 802.11 b/g/n (b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.1, GSM (850/900/1800/1900), UMTS (850/900/1800/2100), LTE (1,3,5,7,8,20); max speed: 150 MBit/s (download), 50 MBit/s (upload); 0.45 W/kg (head), 1.17 W/kg (body), LTE, GPS. height x width x depth (in mm): 8.1 x 145.8 x 72.3 ( = 0.32 x 5.74 x 2.85 in). 11.94 Wh, 3100 mAh Lithium-Ion, removeable.

The Galaxy J5 has been decently beefed up for its 2016 debut: a real metal bezel, polished edges, and a silky shining back cover. However, functionality is not to suffer under that, and thus the back cover can still be removed to replace the battery. predecessor , the casing has grown in all directions, but the screen now also measures 5.2 inches. Galaxy A5 (2016) with an equally-sized display manages to squeeze itself into a more compact casing.. Even larger handsets with a 5.5-inch screen do not weigh as much as Samsung's Galaxy J5 that is also considerably heavier than its predecessor with a weight of 159 grams (~5.6 oz). This somewhat heavier feel could of course be interpreted as a sign of quality. Subjectively, the handset did not give us the impression of being too heavy for everyday use.. The casing is very solid; the metal bezel pays off here. Warping attempts were virtually futile, and the AMOLED screen's design is innately pressure resistant.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. The standard physical smartphone connections are installed, so nothing more than a micro-USB 2.0 port and a 3.5 mm headset jack can be found. External storage devices can be connected to the USB port (USB on-the-go). At least NFC is installed as a wireless option. The infrared interface that Samsung often installs to allow the device to act as a remote control is not included in the Galaxy J5. A fingerprint reader as found in the. 16 GB of storage is an improvement over the former. Samsung's smartphone can also read memory cards: Officially, the micro-SD slot supports cards up to 128 GB. Apps can be moved to the SD card.. Lower edge: USB port, 3.5 mm headset jack. Android 6.0.1 was already preloaded on our review sample, which is the latest Android version. Besides the somewhat more homogeneous looks, the new version includes advantages in terms of security and the option of limiting app permissions, among other things.. Samsung's Touch Wiz interface covers that. It involves a subtle change: The looks are rather softer (the logos with rounded edges, rounded buttons) and the settings have been rearranged. Scrolling to the left opens âBriefingâ, a news aggregator that supposedly displays all important.. Samsung has also preloaded its "S Planner" as a calendar substitute, its fitness app "S Health", Microsoft's Office suite as well as "OneCloud" and "Skype". Furthermore, a direct link to "Google Play Music" is also included. Samsung could not resist the extra profits brought in through the preloaded apps entirely, but they are within acceptable limits.. The OTA software upgrade is rolled out. It has build number MMB29M.J510FNXXU2AQD2 and is not even 60 MB. It is supposed to primarily bring small improvements and implements Google security patches as of 04-01-2017.. 154.46 MB OTA upgrade updates the Galaxy J5 to build number MMB29M.J510FNXXU2AQG3. Apart from an optimized home screen and improved stability, it implements Google security patches as of 07-01-2017.. Update 11/06/2017: a 24.12 MB large OTA firmware update, build number MMB29M.J510FNXXS2AQI4, has been released. In addition to various optimizations and stability improvements it also includes Googleâs security patches as of 08/01/2017.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

A micro-SIM is needed for connecting the Galaxy J5 (2016) to mobile networks. With four GPRS, four UMTS and five LTE frequencies the review sample is suitably equipped for international use. It will probably not function everywhere in the world, but the handset should at least find a network in Europe. The reception in the local network is good, and we had at least 3/4 of LTE reception quality even indoors in an urban area. The maximum speeds in mobile Internet are 150 MBit per second in download and 50 MBit per second in upload.. The Wi-Fi standards 802.11 b/g/n are supported and should be quite sufficient for most users. Since standard 802.11 a is not supported, it is not possible to use 5 GHz band networks. The reception here is also quite good. We still had 3/4 of the signal at a distance of ten meters (~33 ft) to the router (FritzBox 6490) and websites opened quickly. Overall, we noticed that the Galaxy J5 was slower than other smartphones in our Wi-Fi.. Although the GPS module finds some satellites indoors, the signal strength is not strong enough to locate us accurately. It takes a moment outdoors, but enough satellites are found to track us with an accuracy of four meters (~13 ft). Thus, the Galaxy J5 is not quite up front in terms of localization accuracy and speed, but it still delivers decent rates.. To test localization under practical conditions, we take both the Galaxy J5 and Garmin's Edge 500 - a navigation system also used by professionals - on a bike tour. The measured distance is 90 meters (~295 ft) shorter with the Galaxy J5, but it is still acceptable considering the driven route of over twelve kilometers (~7.4 mi). The crossing area shows that the professional system operates more accurately and that the Galaxy J5 simply draws straight lines between two points. According to the Galaxy J5, we often ended up in the river while the Edge 500 tracked our route very precisely when crossing the river. The localization accuracy of Samsung's Galaxy J5 (2016) should be sufficient for normal everyday use. Users with higher demands will have to shell out a lot more money, and will find an excellent tracking system in, for example, the. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Anyone who has ever used a Samsung handset will recognize the phone app. Generally, not much has been modified for Android users. In most cases, a screen with recently called or incoming numbers is opened and the keypad can be accessed via a button at the lower edge. Contacts and favorites can be selected directly via tabs at the upper edge. Contacts can also be edited directly in the app.. The call quality did not impress us: The earpiece tends to produce a ringing noise in high volumes and also makes a relatively stifled impression. The microphone is not impressive either. Although our voice is fairly loud, it also sounds a bit muffled to our contact. The speaker is rather more suitable for rendering voices, but it is not very loud.. Samsung's Galaxy J5 (2016) is category standard in terms of camera resolution with a 13 megapixel camera on the back and a 5 megapixel camera on the front. Not much has changed here when compared with the predecessor. A major unique selling point of our review sample: An LED flash is also installed on the front.. Photos taken with the rear-facing camera are poorly illuminated and show large bright-dark contrasts.. Huawei's P9 displays considerably more evenly illuminated photos, for example. At a first glance, the photos look well-lit in bright surroundings, and are mostly sharp. However, the photos look clearly faded and details of the trees are blurred on a zoomed photo.. The yellow flowers in the meadow that visibly protrude in the photo made with the reflex camera are hardly discernible in the photos of the Galaxy J5 because the color is similar to the green of the meadow. Furthermore, photos in low-light environments also look faded and often blurred. The overall color reproduction looks relatively pale.. Videos can be recorded in 1080p at 30 frames per second. The quality is decent, but the videos sometimes seem rather dark.. The front-facing camera has a resolution of 5 megapixels. In addition to a special selfie mode with face recognition, a mode for groufies is also present; it is possible to record background noises and to shoot a photo series. The image quality is sufficient for selfies, and overall relatively sharp. We also liked the color reproduction. The installed LED flash enables taking selfies even in low-light environments.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. To analyze the photo quality, we photograph our reference card under defined light conditions in the studio. A somewhat dark picture, pale colors and increasing blurriness toward the edges is seen here. The image sharpness is satisfactory in the center even when zoomed.. We photograph the ColorChecker color card to determine color accuracy and place the original colors beside it. Here, the colors of the camera in Samsung's Galaxy J5 (2016) are relatively weak and too bright.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. In addition to the smartphone, the box contains a charger, a USB cable and a headset that sounds fairly decent and fits quite well in the ears. Currently, Samsung does not offer any product-specific accessories on the German website. The offerings were not exactly extensive for the predecessor with just a simple flip cover.. A 24-month warranty is included.. Samsung has incorporated its own on-screen keyboard that comes with smaller but wider spaced keys. It is clearly arranged and offers several input options, such as voice dictation and swiping. A contrast mode that allows the user to change the keyboard's color so that it stands out from the background is also present. However, the black-yellow-orange color layout will not appeal to design fans. It is of course always possible to install another keyboard from Google's Play Store.. The touchscreen is pleasant to use and very responsive even in the outermost corners. The home button is in fact a hardware button, but the controls for back and app overview are touch buttons. The lateral buttons have a clear pressure point and are easy to find.. Samsung is famous for its Super AMOLED panels that achieve absolute black by keeping individual pixels disabled. This theoretically produces an infinitely high contrast and bright colors. The Galaxy J5 (2016) features such a screen; its resolution is the category standard 1280x720 pixels.. At a first glance, AMOLED panels still have a clear disadvantage in brightness, and the Galaxy J5 also accomplishes at most only 299 cd/mÂ² here. However, the brightness can be boosted decently via the "outdoor" button, and then achieves up to 550 cd/mÂ². The illumination with a consistency of 96% is superb, and even large colored areas are illuminated very evenly.. We also noticed that the screen flickers at a very high frequency (PWM). This is often used to reduce the brightness in AMOLED panels, but is usually no problem because the eye does not detect it. However, sensitive users could perceive it at a brightness below 50%.. 293 cd/m² 289 cd/m² 286 cd/m² 299 cd/m² 289 cd/m² 288 cd/m² 299 cd/m² 289 cd/m² 289 cd/m². 96 % Center on Battery: 289. cd/m²) ΔE Color 4.7 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 3 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.03.

Since the disabled black pixels do not shine, both black level and contrast are perfect. Samsung also offers several modes to adapt the color reproduction according to personal preferences or the smartphone's purpose. The smartphone can be set to "adaptive", which is an automatic mode, or the user selects between "cinema", "photo" and "basic". "Cinema" offers the brightest colors, while "basic" produces somewhat paler but also more natural colors. "Photo" is somewhere between the two.. We use the CalMAN software and a spectrophotometer for a more detailed analysis. We also test the smartphone in all three screen modes. The color shifts to the sRGB color space are lowest in "basic" mode, but are present throughout. The colors are clearly oversaturated in "cinema" mode. Grayscale levels are most accurate in "basic" mode, but also have a slight pinkish tint. A minor bluish tint is visible in "cinema" mode. Basically, "cinema" mode is suitable for users who prefer vivid colors and do not strongly value high color fidelity. "Basic" will satisfy anyone who wants to view a more realistic image.. Profile "Basic": CalMAN Saturation Sweeps sRGB. Profile "Photo": CalMAN Saturation Sweeps sRGB. Profile "Cinema": CalMAN Saturation Sweeps sRGB. The glossy screen is of course a big problem for outdoor use in almost all smartphones. However, this can be compensated with sufficient screen brightness. Thanks to a special "outdoor" mode that increases the brightness strongly for 15 minutes; a lot of content can be recognized even in bright surroundings. Naturally this affects battery life and its excessive use could also reduce the service life of the OLEDs in the screen.. AMOLED panels have a further advantage: They can be viewed from all angles with virtually no color loss or brightness aberrations. This is also the case in Samsung's Galaxy J5 (2016).. Response Time Black to White 10 ms ... rise â and fall â combined ↗ 5 ms rise ↘ 5 ms fall The screen shows good response rates in our tests, but may be too slow for competitive gamers. In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.8 (minimum) to 240 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (26.5 ms). Response Time 50% Grey to 80% Grey 20 ms ... rise â and fall â combined ↗ 10 ms rise ↘ 10 ms fall The screen shows good response rates in our tests, but may be too slow for competitive gamers. In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 243.9 Hz. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 243.9. Hz is relatively low, so sensitive users will likely notice flickering and experience eyestrain at the stated brightness setting and below.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. The inner values have been maintained in this year's edition of the Galaxy J5: As with the predecessor, the SoC is. However, the clock has been increased marginally to 1.4 GHz and the working memory has grown by 500 MB to 2 GB. Although the lower mid-range SoC is already two years old, it is powerful enough for most routine tasks. At least we did not observe any stutters, and apps are launched fairly quickly.. A slight lead in the benchmarks over the. is probably due to the above mentioned modifications to the clock rate and working memory. Our review sample is roughly on par with. manage a clear lead with their faster SoCs.. It looks similar in the graphic benchmarks: The Galaxy J5 (2016) utilizes. Qualcomm's Adreno 306 that was also found in the. It is also on par with. since this graphics unit is also installed here.. Therefore, it will only be conditionally worthwhile for owners' of the predecessor to upgrade for performance reasons. Real differences will hardly be noticed. However, the Galaxy J6 (2016) delivers the expected performance.. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) Samsung Galaxy J5 2016.

Surely a storage device specialist such as Samsung will install decent memory chips in its smartphones, won't it? At least an improvement compared with the. is visible in the Galaxy J5 (2016). The write speeds in particular are much higher. Overall, the transfer rates of the internal memory are quite decent, and can sometimes even outperform the more expensive Galaxy A5 .. The micro-SD card reader has to show its speed in the test. We insert our Toshiba Exceria Pro M401 reference card. Our review sample is clearly faster than. Unfortunately, we do not have comparable rates for the other devices. The transfer rates are overall decent, but considerably higher speeds would be possible with our fast micro-SD card..

An average of 16 frames per second does not lead to smooth gameplay in the fast-paced race game " Asphalt 8 " using maximum details. Subjectively, we found the frame rates as acceptable and the game ran fairly smoothly in our opinion. However, the smartphone definitely operates at the limits of its performance capacity here.. We can confirm an average of 30 frames per second in the first-person shooter " Dead Trigger 2 ". Thus, the game should be easily playable without lags.. Control via touchscreen and position sensor functioned impeccably and without any dropouts.. "Asphalt 8": Lag-free subjectively, but very low frame rates. "Dead Trigger 2": Stable 30 frames. The casing heats up to a maximum of 38.5 degrees Celsius (~101 degrees Fahrenheit) on the upper rear. Although that is noticeable, it is still acceptable. Acer Liquid Z630S , remain much cooler.. The temperature increase stays quite consistent over the entire casing. The smartphone's lower area is marginally cooler. The smartphone is within a normal range in idle mode with a maximum surface temperature of 31 degrees Celsius (~88 degrees Fahrenheit).. Do higher temperatures affect the performance? We find out by using a stress test, and run GFXBench battery benchmark that performs the same sequence 30 times and logs the frame rates. Only marginal fluctuations are seen in the course of the 30 cycles. Thus, it can be presumed that Samsung's Galaxy J5 (2016) maintains its performance even during permanent load.. 34.3 °C 34 °C 33.7 °C. 36.4 °C 36.1 °C 34.4 °C. 36.9 °C 37 °C 34.7 °C.

Although the camera protrudes slightly, the sound muffles clearly depending on the surface, for example, when the smartphone is placed on a table. Overall, the mono-speakerâs sound is adequate for a smartphone, but it will not win any awards. Its maximum volume of almost 84 dB(A) is average; basses are virtually non-existent. Even when the speaker is not face down on a surface, it always sounds as if the audio output is stifled. The 3.5 mm headset jack or Bluetooth are alternatives; both render a clear audio signal.. Pleasingly, Samsung's Galaxy J5 (2016) does not consume any power when turned off, and only a low 0.12 watts in standby. Overall, the consumption is much lower than that of its. In fact, it is really frugal compared with other devices. Its maximum consumption is 3.1 watts while in idle mode it consumes. These are all really good and low rates. Approximately 3 hours were needed for charging in our test.. Off / Standby 0 / 0.12 Watt Idle 0.61 / 1.41 / 1.51 Watt. The battery has grown considerably compared with last year's. It occupies a relatively large battery compartment in the back, and certainly contributes to the much heavier weight of the Galaxy J5 (2016). It can supply 11.94 watt hours. Acer's Liquid Z630S clearly surpasses that with over 15 Wh. However, its power consumption is also much higher.

In review: Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016). It is easy to answer the question whether the update of Samsung's Galaxy J5 has been successful: Yes.. The metal casing gives a much higher-quality impression and looks more modern than the predecessor's old-fashioned casing. The front-facing camera has been upgraded with a full-fledged LED flash, the working memory and storage device capacities have been increased, a somewhat faster processor and more screen surface are now installed. Old virtues like the AMOLED panel and removable battery have been maintained. Furthermore, the battery life is now much longer.. Samsung's Galaxy J5 (2016) is not perfect, but it is a really good smartphone from the lower mid-range. Thanks to its long battery life, the AMOLED panel and modern operating system, anyone looking for a new and affordable smartphone should keep the handset in mind.. We have a few points of criticism after all: The transmission rates in our Wi-Fi were unusually low, the device is comparatively heavy, and the voice quality is not impressive. The speaker did not impress us, and the cameras images look dark and rather faded.. Buyers who can live with these will not go much wrong with Samsung's Galaxy J5 (2016). It might even be worthwhile for owners of the predecessor to upgrade.. Samsung Galaxy J5 2016 - 2016-05-11 05/11/2016 v5.1 Florian Wimmer.

The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) sports a 5.2-inch Super AMOLED display with 720 x 1280 pixels, weighing 159 grams, and measuring 145.8 x 72.3 x 8.1 mm. The handset is powered by a quad-core processor clocked at 1.2 GHz, coming with 2 GB of RAM, and a 3100 mAh battery.. Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) Review Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) manual Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.74 x 2.85 x 0.32 inches (145.8 x 72.3 x 8.1 mm). Weight: 5.57 oz (158 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 5.2 inches. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, CMOS image sensor. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Effects. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Quad-core, 1200 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 21.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20.

Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: NFC, ANT+, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 28 Mar 2016. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Most of its features are similar to the Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016). The Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) is just the higher version of it. Samsung hasn't announced the pricing of the new Super AMOLED HD display equipped J series yet, nor the possibility of it being available in other countries.. Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) suits every kind of user. Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) in the Philippines. Samsung has yet another delightful smartphone this year, and it's the Galaxy J5 (2016).

Coming in the category of mid-range smartphones, this new Galaxy J5 (2016) packs great specs and features.. Samsung is one company that focuses on improvements and enhancements.

As exciting as this device is, it looks interesting too. The design of this model has been kept very simple but elegant at the same time. Its body, of course, has a sleek design which is pretty much alike to the previous version.. The construction of this body has been done by a durable metal frame. A diamond cut finish has also been set to this frame. The back panel of this device features a fine sophistication as it has got a premium look and feel with a brushed metal finish.. The fantastic aesthetics of Galaxy J5's body comes in 3 different colors to choose from, and they are Rose Gold, Gold and White. A superior grip and handling is maintained over the hands as the edges have been made smooth. So the overall premium feel of this device is very pleasing..

Samsung Galaxy J5 Review: In Depth. Samsung Galaxy J5 Review: Screen and media. Samsung Galaxy J5 Review: Features and OS. Samsung Galaxy J5 Review: Performance and battery life. Solid battery life Strong display for the price Decent cameras. Samsung Galaxy J5 Review: One of Samsung’s best budget mobiles, the Galaxy J5 is a fierce rival to the Motorola Moto G and a solid smartphone for just £150 SIM-free. Here’s what we think after using the Galaxy J5 as our full-time phone.. After the massive launch of its latest flagship phones, the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge , Samsung has sneaked out a fair few cheaper mobiles with little to no fanfare. And that’s a damned shame, because they’ve all been very impressive. The 2016 remakes of the Galaxy A3 and Galaxy A5 are brilliant mid-rangers packing suprisingly premium features, while the Galaxy J5 is down at the budget end of the price scale.. You can bag the Galaxy J5 on the cheap from most UK networks, but is it a satisfying little blower? Here’s our full Galaxy J5 review.. Read next: How does the Galaxy J5 compare with the Moto G, Wileyfox Swift and LG X Screen?. Samsung hasn’t gone wild and crazy when it comes to the Galaxy J5’s design. Like the Galaxy A Range, this phone looks the spit of Samsung’s 2015 flagship phone, the Galaxy S6 , with those distinctive curves and the physical home button planted directly beneath the screen. The only real difference is the matt plastic backing of the J5, which at least is less prone to smudging than the S6’s glass rear.. Look a little closer and you’ll notice that the J5’s back actually comes right off, revealing a removable battery and the card slots inside. That’s rare for Samsung’s mobile, which usually come fused into one solid piece. It’s also great news if you’re always on the move and prefer replacing your mobile’s battery to lugging around a separate battery pack.. At just 5-inches, which is positively diminutive compared to a lot of modern smartphones, the Galaxy J5 is quite easy to operate with just one hand. Stretching your thumb to the top of the screen to drag down the notifications bar is no real problem, while the curved edges and back make it a comfortable fit to your palm.. You don’t get the water resistance of the Moto G, but the Galaxy J5 does feel quite solid and will happily survive a drop onto a carpeted floor from a distance. We reckon it’d be sturdy enough to handle the odd concrete interaction too, although we didn’t test this with our (only) review model.. Check out our Galaxy J5 unboxing and hands-on review for a closer look. If you’re used to Samsung’s more vibrant panels, found on handsets like the Galaxy S7 and A5, then the Galaxy J5’s Super AMOLED screen might seem rather subdued in comparison. However, although colours don’t explode off the display in quite the same manner, this is still a solidly built panel that competes with the very best budget screens out there.. At 5-inches in size, the J5’s screen is spacious enough for comfortable typing, web browsing and the rest, while viewing angles are reassuringly wide. The 720p HD resolution ensures that your photos, movies and everything else look sharp and pretty too.. In fact, this is one of the best budget displays we’ve seen in recent times, easily going toe-to-toe with the Moto G’s excellent 720p panel.. Android Lollipop (5.1.1) is the OS of Samsung’s choosing, which means you miss out on some of the latest Android Marshmallow features (such as total control over your app permissions). Still, the good news is that Samsung’s own TouchWiz overlay, which changes the look and feel of Android to make the Galaxy J5 stand out from rivals, is a lot more user friendly than it used to be.. There’s no Flipboard desktop on the J5, presumably to help keep performance smooth, while the colourful icons and smart notifications bar (complete with plenty of handy shortcuts) make for a satisfying experience. My only issue is the unnecessary duplication when it comes to apps. Samsung’s insistence on adding its own apps to the Galaxy phones means you have two web browsers, two email clients and so on, which clutter up the J5’s meagre storage and can’t be removed.. Thankfully the rather tiny 8GB of built-in storage can be quickly and easily expanded using a microSD memory card.. The Galaxy J5 may pack a basic 1.2GHz quad-core processor, but Android and everything else runs with a satisfying smoothness. I didn’t see any serious stutters or crashes while using the handset, although the lack of support for 5GHz WiFi meant for the occasional slowdown while web browsing. Thankfully I had no trouble with 4G browsing and. the latest fast-paced games play with a dependable frame rate.. Of course there’s no support for side-by-side multitasking on the J5, which is to be expected. But you can keep apps running in the background, with no negative impact on performance.. Samsung’s premium phones might not boast the best battery life, but its more affordable handsets are very impressive. The Galaxy J5 is no different, offering close to two full days of use on a single charge, even with regular use. And even if you want to stream video, you’ll get close to ten hours of playback before the J5 dies.. There’s no support for Samsung’s ‘Adaptive Fast Charging’, but the J5 still charges quite quickly once you hook it up to the mains.. When it comes to budget snappers, the Moto G is still our favourite, boasting a highly dependable 13-megapixel camera that produces stunning results in almost any environment. However, the Samsung Galaxy J5 comes damn close with its own 13-meg lens.. I took hundreds of photos over the days I was using the J5 and the majority were pleasingly sharp and detail packed when viewed back on a big screen. Colours are realistically reproduced (rather than the vibrant hues you get from the Galaxy S7) and active subjects are usually well handled; even hyper, thrashing children and crazy cats.. It’s not an infallible budget snapper by any means. Shots taken indoors can look a little ‘fuzzy’, lacking the crisp detail that you get from outdoor snaps. In low light you inevitably get a lot of grain, but thankfully there’s an LED flash to compensate. And if you’re shooting in bright light, you can expect white outfits and buildings (and bald heads) to appear oversaturated. However, for a budget camera we’re still very happy with the results.. We’re also happy with the Full HD movies we took on the Galaxy J5. The lens snaps into focus reasonably quickly and handles changes in lighting well, while sucking up plenty of detail.. Finally, the 5-megapixel selfie camera does an admirable job when you’re out and about and even comes fitted with an LED flash of its own, something that’s rarely found on mobiles. It certainly does the job when you’re in a pub or some other moody environment, to avoid grainy, ugly snaps.. At this price, the Galaxy J5 is a very strong rival for the Moto G and other cut-price handsets. It’s a solid all-rounder, offering dependable performance and excellent battery life as well as some brilliant camera tech. We prefer the vanilla Android Marshmallow experience of the Moto G, but Sammy fans will love what the Galaxy J5 has to offer.. Big thanks to MobileFun for sending in our Galaxy J5 review sample..

Good looking phone with some drawbacks. Hi,nnI got this phone from Flipkart on Friday and here is my 3 days review.nnPros:n * Beautiful designn * Very handy, easy to handlen * Battery backup is greatn * Back camera is goodn * No heating issuesn nCons:n * If we are charging, it will not show any light or any notification whether it is charging or not. We need to on the screen and check whether it is charging or not. So every time we need to turn it on and see whether it is charging or not.n* Camera issue: Once you take the picture and then press the back button it is taking some time to come back to camera mode.n* If you turn on the flash and take pic with back camera it is taking some time to capture the picture. With out Flash it is taking very fast.n* Volume is very low. Not enough for a medium sized room.n* Ear phones are not good especially for me. nnnWill post my feedback after using it another 15 days.nnThanks.

It has been improved with the addition of General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and later via the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology.. TD-SCDMA (Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access) is a 3G standard for mobile networks. It is developed as an alternative to the W-CDMA standard in China by the Chinese Academy of Telecomunications Technology, Datang Telecom and Siemens AG, and combines TDMA and CDMA.. UMTS stands for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System. Based on the GSM standard, it is deemed as a 3G mobile network standard. It has been developed by the 3GPP and its major advantage is the provision of greater bandwidth and spectral efficiency, due to the W-CDMA technology.. LTE is deemed to be the fourth generation (4G) of mobile communications technology. It has been developed by the 3GPP based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies in order to increase the speed and capacity of wireless data networks.

CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. Some processors have a level 0 cache memory, which is accessed quicker than the L1, L2, L3, and so one cache memories. Besides achieving better performance, it also consumes less power.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications.

Home / News / Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) and Galaxy J7 (2016) review. Design Display Camera Software Performance Battery Life Wrap Up Pros Cons Attractive displays No auto brightness Unbelievably good battery life Average front camera Smooth software (mostly) Unimpressive audio quality Nice design for the asking price Unergonomic home button. Samsung’s Galaxy J series debuted last year and went on to see considerable success in the budget smartphone market. It wasn’t surprising – the Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 were two of the best low-cost phones the Korean giant had ever made , with a good mix of features and pricing. This year, the Galaxy J5 (2016) and Galaxy J7 (2016) have arrived with several upgrades over their predecessors. These two phones are also the first budget Samsung phones with metal in their construction, and a quick first glance at their features list would make you think the new devices will build on the popularity of the original J5 and J7.. But are the Galaxy J5 (2016) and Galaxy J7 (2016) as good as that quick glance suggests? Well, that is exactly what we will find out in our official review.. As mentioned above, the J5 (2016) and J7 (2016) bring metal to Samsung’s affordable smartphone stable. Like the Galaxy Alpha that first introduced metal to the world of Samsung’s Galaxies, the new J5 and J7 have metal only on their sides, with the rest of the phone being the usual mix of glass and plastic. The back is removable and so is the battery, with both needing to be removed in order to access the two SIM card slots (the microSD slot is accessible on the fly).. But before I get carried away with the minute details, let’s talk about the phones’ designs. Except for a recessed and slightly hard to press home button, the J5 (2016) and J7 (2016) look and feel pretty great. The metal frame on the side adds to the overall feel, with the power and volume buttons extremely well built and easy to press. The back is very smooth, but that doesn’t make handling a problem. The phones might feel slippery when you pick them up, but they stick to your hand when you actually start using them.. Given the large batteries inside these handsets (3,100 mAh and 3,300 mAh), the new phones are rather light, which works in their favor when combined with the grippy back cover. The home button, as previously mentioned, is the only point of contention here. It’s extremely thin, and unless you’re applying notable force, the home button isn’t very comfortable to press. That’s unfortunate considering how important the home button is when you’re using a Samsung device.. Samsung has long ignored its affordable smartphones when it comes to how they look and feel, and the Galaxy J5 (2016) and Galaxy J7 (2016) feel like the company’s first step towards rectifying that oversight. Oddly, quality checks don’t seem to have been properly done – both our J5 and J7 review units had visible scratches on the rim on the edges next to the display bezel, although we’re guessing this might be a limited scenario.. Super AMOLED displays are slowly but surely becoming a norm on Samsung devices, and the Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 (2016) carry the trend forward with 5.2-inch and 5.5-inch Super AMOLED displays. The J5 has seen a slight bump in screen size over the original J5 and also an increase in resolution (to 1280×720 pixels from 960×540 pixels). The J7 (2016) has a 5.5-inch display that comes with Full HD resolution in China but only 720p in other regions. There’s not a lot of difference between the sizes of the two phones because of the larger screen on the J5, but the J7 is wider and a tad less easy to use one-handed.. In terms of quality, you get everything a Super AMOLED panel offers, including high color contrast, deep blacks, and wide viewing angles. The colors might not be as punchy as on Samsung’s costlier devices, but they. still make the displays stand out. You can choose between various display modes, a feature Samsung is no longer limiting to its high-end devices. The Basic screen mode is the most accurate and sober, but the whites go a bit too yellow for my taste. It’s the case with the AMOLED Photo mode as well, which means you’re better off sticking to the Adaptive Display or AMOLED Cinema modes for the best experience.. The J5’s screen is considerably sharp, but that isn’t the case with the J7’s. You won’t notice the pixels too often in regular usage, but bring the phone just a little closer to your eyes and the limitation of the not-so-high resolution becomes apparent. It’s a shame, really, given how the Chinese variant gets a Full HD panel. Other than pixelated content, it also means slightly less content fits on the screen at any given moment.. Another issue with the displays here is something that we have spoken against in the past, and that’s the lack of an auto brightness option. There just isn’t any excuse for not putting in an ambient light sensor on any smartphone these days no matter what the price tag. It just mars what is otherwise an attractive visual experience. The Outdoors mode makes a return from previous budget Galaxies for increased sunlight visibility for a limited period, although even at regular maximum brightness, reading the screen under the sun never posed a problem.. A 13-megapixel camera on the rear, a 5-megapixel camera on the front, and an LED flash accompanying both sensors. The camera setup remains unchanged from the original J5 and J7, except for the fact that the front camera also has an aperture of f/1.9 like the back camera, meaning better photos in underlit conditions. The front camera’s LED flash is once again just a flashlight and not a true camera flash – it remains lit as long as the flash option is set to on. But Samsung has also added the “make the screen flash all white” trick that was introduced on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge,. to give you slightly more light when you’re taking selfies in the dark.. The rear cameras take photos with nice detail in good lighting conditions. There’s a dark aura on the outlines of objects and the colors are a little drab – it’s something we have seen on all of Samsung’s non-flagship phones, but the images are otherwise quite useful even outside of your Facebook or Instagram posts. Focusing is surprisingly quick, especially when you move from a close-up object to something far away and vice versa. Of course, you won’t be taking great macros with these phones, but that shouldn’t really come as a surprise to most people. Things fall apart at night, which is another aspect that most people should expect should they spend money on these devices.. The front camera’s performance depends on the kind of lighting you have around you. Under fluorescent LED lighting, your selfies will come out extremely dull. Switch to yellow lighting and selfies suddenly become much better. There isn’t a lot of fine detail in either case, but it’s not exactly too bad, either. flash on the front is useless except in very dark conditions, so it really just depends on the environment when it comes to the quality of pictures taken by the front camera.. Samsung’s “double press home button to launch camera” feature is present on the J5 (2016) and J7 (2016), and it works exactly like it should. Images are captured in 4:3 ratio even at the highest resolutions, a limitation that we have seen on all of Samsung’s non-flagship smartphones recently (and on the S7 and S7 edge, because of their 12-megapixel sensors). The camera app is the same as the S7’s; there’s a Pro mode available, but it’s limited to basics like ISO, white balance, and exposure control. The ability to shoot HDR photos is missing from both devices.. Here go a few camera samples:. Both the J5 (2016) and J7 (2016) run Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box in some markets, and Android 5.1 Lollipop in others. We had devices with the former thankfully, putting the same software that we see on the Galaxy flagships on our fingertips, save for some features that you don’t get because you paid less for these phones. On the contrary, there are a couple of features that we don’t see on the flagships, like the Ultra Data Saving mode for reduced data usage and S Bike mode for safer bike riding. We have already gone into detail on how S Bike works , so we’ll just let you read up on it at this link.. Themes are supported, and despite the screen resolution, we found many of the themes for high-end Galaxy devices available for the J5 and J7 as well. Since both devices come with NFC, there is support for Android’s default payment service and for Samsung Pay in markets where it is available (and once Samsung decides to make the service compatible with these phones). The NFC chip also serves the purpose of activating S Bike mode if you have NFC tags; oddly, there are no NFC tags in the box, which wasn’t the case with the cheaper Galaxy J3 (2016) here in India.. Let’s talk about a few minor things. You get preloaded Microsoft apps like every other Samsung phone since last year, along with 100GB of free OneDrive storage (which cannot be claimed if you have done so already on a previous Samsung phone). These apps can be found in the Microsoft folder in the app drawer; speaking of the app drawer, you still need to sort the apps by name manually every time you install a new app. One-handed operation mode from higher-end Galaxy phones is present here, but you don’t get features like Download Booster or Multi Window, probably because of the budget hardware.. Overall, the software is more or less similar to the original Galaxy J5 and J7, except that it is based on a newer version of Android and brings further optimization and an improved user interface.. The Galaxy J7 (2016) is the better performer of the two new Galaxy J handsets. Well, both phones are smooth and sufficiently quick, but the J5 has considerably more stutter and delays in regular usage. It’s nothing bad, but it’s clear the J7 and its octa-core Exynos 7870 SoC (the J5 has the old quad-core Snapdragon 410) have the lead when it comes to everyday performance. Apps don’t fire up instantly on either device – there’s a slight pause before the screen animates and an app starts loading, but this is rather normal for devices in this segment. Installation of apps can take some time; not surprising, as you don’t have the fast UFS 2.0 storage found on Samsung’s flagship smartphones.. Even on the J7 there is some stutter here and there, especially when you’re jumping around between various apps too quickly, but otherwise it’s consistently smoother. Browsing is fine on both devices, though they did sometimes get stuck after a link was clicked or a heavy webpage was being browsed. Of course, high-end gaming is where the affordable nature of these phones becomes apparent. Regular games run just fine, but heavier titles like. don’t always manage to offer a smooth framerate. The J7 (2016) is again the better performer here – Modern Combat 5 defaulted to medium graphics quality on the bigger phone, while on the J5 it started off with the lowest quality setting.. Both the J5 (2016) and J7 (2016) come with 16GB of internal storage, and the J5 gets the benefit here as the original had only 8GB of storage. The microSD slot can accept cards of up to 128GB, but like the S7 and S7 edge (or any other Samsung device running Marshmallow), adoptable storage isn’t supported. For those unaware, adoptable storage lets you make the external storage a part of the internal storage, making for increased space for apps and other data that can’t be saved to the external storage. Still, you can move apps to the SD card after they’re installed (and if they support running from external storage), so it’s not all bad.. The J5’s call quality was rather problematic – there were quite a few instances where the person on the other end wasn’t very clear. The J7 didn’t have the same issue, though, and when it came to network reception, neither device had problems latching on to the fastest network available. Audio from the loudspeaker is as average as it gets.. It’s quiet, there is no clear difference between high and low frequencies, and the rear placement means sound get muffled when you put the phones on a soft surface (like a bed, or inside your jeans pocket). The supplied earphones make things better, but audio quality is middling for the most part as befits the budget pricing of these handsets.. With 3,100 mAh and 3,300 mAh batteries inside the Galaxy J5 (2016) and Galaxy J7 (2016), you would think these phones would offer stellar battery life, and you would be right. In fact, the Galaxy J7 (2016) was mind-bogglingly impressive – on the first full charge, the phone managed to last me a total of two days, with a screen time of more than 7 hours. This included setting up newly installed apps, a couple of hours of LTE data, around 10 minutes of navigation (on LTE), and a fair bit of time checking and general usage.. I even turned off the app optimization feature that prevents apps from running in the background if they haven’t been used for a few days. This didn’t really play a part as you need at least three days of initial usage before the feature kicks in, but I can’t imagine how much better the battery life would be once app optimization starts doing its work. The low screen resolution no doubt helped, in addition to Marshmallow’s Doze feature, and the J7 (2016) is simply a force to reckon with in terms of battery endurance.. The Galaxy J5 (2016) wasn’t as great, either because of the Snapdragon 410 inside or the smaller battery size, but you’re still looking at more than a day of battery life in all but the most demanding scenarios (long gaming sessions and the like). You have Samsung’s regular and Ultra power saving modes, but I’m sure most folks will rarely need to use those. When it comes to charging times, both phones take up to two hours to reach 100 percent capacity. Not at all fast, but with the long-lasting batteries, the charging times are a non-issue.. Everyone in China is making cheap phones with metal bodies, and it was only a matter of time before Samsung decided it could no longer sit on the sidelines and watch. The Galaxy J5 (2016) and Galaxy J7 (2016) with their partly metal bodies are a good start for the Korean giant, with quite a few features that make them attractive purchases. Like the original J5 and J7, solid battery life is the defining feature, but with welcome improvements to the software, (rear) camera, and viewing experience.. Not everything is rosy, however, what with missing basic features like auto brightness and standard point of contentions like poor audio that. really shouldn’t plague even budget devices these days. But as a large corporation, Samsung can only do so much to bring more and more value to a segment where profits are already hard to come by, and keeping that in mind the Galaxy J5 (2016) and Galaxy J7 (2016) are pretty good options for anyone looking for a smartphone that doesn’t break the bank..
