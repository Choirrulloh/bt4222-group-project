It comes with a metal unibody design, a combination of 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel cameras, and a Snapdragon 430 chipset.. The Lava features a 5-inch HD IPS On-Cell display, and is powered by a 1GHz quad-core chipset paired with 1GB of RAM. Also on offer is 8GB of internal memory, which can be further, expanded to 32GB using a microSD card.. On the photography front, the smartphone comes with an 8-megapixel rear camera with 4x digital zoom and 1080p video recording capabilities, while up front there is a 2-megapixel selfie camera. The smartphone comes with 4,000mAh battery along with a super power save mode. The company claims that the battery is good enough to offer standby time of up to 351 hours and talktime on 2G up to 25 hours.. On the connectivity front, the smartphone supports dual-SIM, 4G, VoLTE, Bluetooth V4.0, GPS, 3.5mm jack and Wi-Fi. The Lava X38 runs Android Marshmallow out-of-the-box. The device also supports 12 Indian languages, flip to mute, smart gestures, time lapse video and slow motion video to name a few.. Published Date: August 5, 2016 5:15 PM IST.
