The Redmi 5 comes with a 5.7" HD+ screen that boasts a resolution of 720 by 1440 pixels and has a Snapdragon 450 chipset ticking alongside a 3,300mAh battery, which should provide an admirable battery life. This one could be paired with either 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage or 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.. Dimensions: 5.98 x 2.87 x 0.30 inches (151.8 x 72.8 x 7.7 mm). Weight: 5.54 oz (157 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1440 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 1800 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 14 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8.

Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi has long been famed for its ability to disrupt the accepted order of the smartphone market with powerful, well-built handsets that don’t break the bank. But until very recently, it has focused its business almost exclusively on Eastern markets.. In 2017, however, the company confirmed that it’s following in the footsteps of Asian rivals such as Huawei and Asus by expanding into the West. The recently launched Redmi 5 (and its bigger brother, the Redmi 5 Plus) is a solid candidate for release outside of Japan.. It boasts an 18:9 aspect ratio screen, Octa-core chipset, 3GB of RAM and a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera, all powered by Android Nougat with Xiaomi’s custom MIUI 9 skin sitting on top. While it isn’t officially available in the UK at the time of writing, you can order the Redmi 5 from online stores such as. Gearbest for around £130 .. Related: Best Android Phones 2018. Xiaomi can hardly be accused of jumping on the 18:9, big-screen bandwagon – the company virtually created the market with the Mi Mix, which has since been supplanted by 2017’s Mi Mix 2. However, the Redmi 5 is clearly designed to cash in on this new craze by offering a huge, face-filling display at a budget price.. The Redmi 5’s 5.7-inch IPS screen fills the front of the phone, with small bezels at the top and bottom. This gives the handset a tall profile, making it comfortable to hold and use. Above the screen you’ll find the 5-megapixel selfie cam and ambient light sensors, as well as the in-call speaker.. The 2.5D Gorilla Glass screen sits on top of a part-aluminum, part-plastic frame. The rounded edges are made from plastic too, as are two small sections at the top and bottom of the back section, which allow the antenna to function.. The majority of the phone’s rear is metal, and houses the 12-megapixel camera, LED flash, fingerprint scanner and ‘Mi’ logo. The right-hand edge of the unit features the power and volume buttons, while the dual nano-SIM tray is found on the left-hand edge.. On the of top of the device you’ll find the IR blaster – which allows the Redmi 5 to control certain electronic devices, such as TVs – as well as the 3.5mm headphone socket. At the opposite end there’s a single speaker and a micro-USB port for charging and data transfer; strangely, Xiaomi has decided against using the more advanced USB Type-C standard here.. The colour options are black, gold, light blue and rose gold. As you can see from the photos, we had the gold version; the metallic look is rather fetching. Sadly, there’s no water or dust protection.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Xiaomi has kindly included a thin silicone case in the box, but you may wish to upgrade to a beefier case if you’re concerned about damaging the unit.. The Redmi 5’s IPS screen is good for the price, but some colours do look slightly washed out. Also, when viewing from an angle, the display looks noticeably dimmer.. Also an issue is that it’s a 720p panel spread across 5.7-inches, which means pixels are clearly visible, even if you don’t have your nose all the way up to the glass.. The larger – and more expensive – Redmi 5 Plus has a 1080p screen, so if pixel density is a priority for you then you’d be better off opting for that model instead.. Unlike many other Chinese OEMs, Xiaomi uses quite an extreme UI skin on its Android phones. In the past, MIUI has been compared to iOS, and aims to combine the flexibility and customisation of Google’s OS with the slick, uniform design of Apple’s software.. MIUI 9 is the latest refinement of this UI and comes pre-loaded on the Redmi 5 (the Mi Mix 2 launched with the previous edition). However, MIUI 9 is still sitting atop Android Nougat; it will most likely be updated to Oreo sometime in 2018.. Even if you’re used to Android skins such as Samsung’s TouchWiz and HTC’s Sense UI, you may find MIUI to be something of a shock – especially if you’re importing the Redmi 5 direct from a reseller in China. The model reviewed here has no Google apps installed at all – they’re not loaded on Xiaomi handsets sold in its homeland – and a lot of pre-installed programs are aimed at Chinese users.. It’s possible to set the phone’s system language to English when you first turn it on, but elements of the UI – such as the keyboard – still showcase some Chinese characters.. You’ll have to create a ‘Mi Account’ to access Xiaomi’s app store, where it’s possible to download an installer that makes your phone Google-ready, along with apps such as Gmail, Google Photos and Google Music. It takes only a short while to get the phone up to speed, but it may be too much of a hassle for casual users, so keep this in mind before importing.. Once that’s out of the way, MIUI 9 has plenty of decent features to offer. Swiping to the right from your main homescreen brings up a series of info panels that display shortcuts to recent apps, the number of steps you’ve taken and your upcoming events.. It’s also possible to randomise your lockscreen wallpaper using a built-in carousel option, which pulls high-quality images from Xiaomi’s own servers. The phone’s built-in security app monitors for suspicious activity, allows you to clean unwanted files, and even set up a ‘second space’ that allows you to have more than one instance of the same app installed on the device. Furthermore, MIUI is entirely customisable, and you can download new themes to give the interface a fresh look, right down to the design of the lockscreen.. The downside to this deep, granular level of customisation is that Xiaomi’s UI comes with some less welcome changes, such as the way it throttles the background activity of certain apps by default to conserve battery life. Thankfully, you can display these ‘optimisations’ in the settings.. Another bonus of MIUI is that Xiaomi issues regular updates and is constantly working with the community on bug fixes and feature requests. If you wish, you can shift over to the ‘development’ version of MIUI 9 and benefit from a steady stream of new builds. By default, however, you’re on the ‘stable’ ROM, which means you don’t have to worry too much about experimental features going wrong.. The Redmi 5 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 450 Octa-core chipset and comes with 2GB or 3GB of RAM, depending on the model you pick. Despite the use of a mid-range chip, the performance of the phone is excellent – using a 720p screen will have contributed to this, since it means there are less pixels for the internal hardware to push around.. Activities such as browsing the web, watching HD videos and playing 3D games didn’t cause any problems, and it’s possible to have several apps open at once without any drop in speed. MIUI 9 is slick and smooth as well – but, as previously noted, you may wish to turn off some optimisations that cause background processes to be unnecessarily shut down.. Sadly, there’s no NFC included here, so the Redmi 5 can’t be used to make contactless mobile payments using the Android Pay application. It’s a shame, since NFC is rapidly becoming a super-useful feature; it can also be used to effortlessly pair devices such as headphones, for example. But given the budget nature of the phone – and the fact that NFC hasn’t taken off in mainland China to the same degree it has in the West – its omission is understandable, if not any less disappointing.. The phone’s single speaker is situated on the bottom edge of the device. It’s relatively clear but a little on the weak side, even at maximum volume. There were a few instances where it rang in our pocket and we couldn’t hear it due to environmental noise. Only the vibration informed us that we had an incoming call. The earpiece speaker is also rather flat in terms of volume, but call quality is generally good.. Xiaomi, like so many Chinese phone makers, has flirted with the dual camera concept over the past year or so. However, just like it did with the Mi Mix 2, the firm has decided against using this setup in the Redmi 5, which only has a single 12-megapixel, f/2.2 aperture snapper.. It isn’t capable of any portrait mode tricks like the OnePlus 5T and Google Pixel , but for the price this sensor is capable of capturing some striking photos, packed with colour and detail. It’s also quick to focus and snap, even when the LED flash is used. The only negative is that low-light shots are a little underwhelming, but that’s true of many smartphone snappers.. The rear camera goes all the way up to 4K at 30fps, which is impressive for such a low-cost phone. The front-facing camera records 1080p at 30fps, and takes decent enough shots, if you’re into that kind of thing.. The Redmi 5’s 3300mAh battery is pretty much standard for a phone with a screen of this size, and with Xiaomi’s aggressive performance optimisations in place, it will comfortably last you well over 24 hours. But even with these switched off, stamina remains pretty good. After a day of web browsing, photo taking and game playing, we still had plenty of juice left in the tank when we got home.. Despite the fact that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 450 allows it on a hardware level, there’s no support for the company’s Quick Charging standard baked into the Redmi 5. It would appear that Xiaomi has disabled the feature, perhaps to avoid paying Qualcomm any additional licence fees. Not that it matters, since the bundled charger will fully replenish the phone’s battery in around 2 hours.. The cheaper 2GB of RAM model comes with just 16GB of storage, which won’t be enough for seasoned mobile users. Thankfully, the more common 3GB of RAM edition has 32GB of space; and if that still proves too tight then you can use one of the nano-SIM trays to insert a microSD card.. The Redmi 5 is the perfect smartphone for those who want to get in on the ‘big screen’ revolution without having to break the bank. That 18:9 aspect ratio display might not be in the same league as the AMOLED panels seen on more expensive rivals, but when you take into account how much less it costs, it’s hard to grumble.. The Snapdragon 450 is also weaker than chips you’d find in Android flagships, but not to the degree that you’d perhaps imagine; there’s still more than enough power on tap here for casual mobile users.. While it lacks waterproofing, NFC, and is saddled with a 720p screen, the Redmi 5 is incredible value for money at just over £100. If you’re keen to watch the pennies but still want a smartphone with a lovely widescreen display, then this comes highly recommended.. Just be mindful of the fact that as an imported handset, you’ll need to do some additional legwork to get it to run properly in the UK.. The Redmi 5 offers an impressive 18:9 screen along with decent internal tech for a bargain price, but it’s not officially available in the UK, so be prepared for some extra effort to get it running as expected..

Xiaomi Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus: Everything you need to know. Xiaomi's new Redmi 5 is a $120 stunner with a massive screen. Xiaomi’s popular, budget Redmi device lineup has been refreshed with two new models : The Redmi 5 Plus and its smaller, cheaper sidekick, the Redmi 5. We’re fans of the Redmi range , which provides a strong design and specification, along with excellent value for money. This winning formula continues with the Redmi 5 Plus and Redmi 5.. Here’s everything you need to know about the two new phones.. The two new Redmi phones were revealed at an event on December 7, and always prove popular. The Redmi 5 was joined by the Redmi 5 Plus, in a change to Xiaomi’s previous nomenclature.. Previous versions of this model used the “Note” name, which Xiaomi has dropped for the Redmi 5.. Xiaomi has only announced the Redmi 5 phones for China, although they may be released in other regions later, including Spain, where Xiaomi made its recent push into Europe , making it easier for European fans to purchase a locally compatible device.. In China the 2GB/16GB Redmi 5 costs 800 yuan/$120, and the 3GB/32GB model is 900 yuan/$136. The Redmi 5 Plus costs a little more. The 3GB/32GB Redmi 5 Plus is 1,000 yuan/$150, while the 4GB/64GB version is 1,300 yuan/$196.. There are two Redmi phone models, with the Redmi 5 Plus being the larger, more powerful of the two. We think it looks great, especially in the great range of colors available. The Redmi 5 Plus has a 5.99-inch screen with a 2,160 x 1,080 pixel resolution, and the curved edges around it are reminiscent of the LG G6 and LG Q6 .. A metal body surrounds the screen, with plastic end caps on the back to allow the antenna to operate, while a 2.5D curved piece of glass is over the display itself. The previous Redmi 4X was very comfortable to hold, and we expect the same from the Redmi 5 and 5 Plus. There are four color options — blue, gold, rose, and black — with all but the black model having a white bezel around the screen. A fingerprint sensor is set underneath the single rear camera lens and flash unit.. It has 12 megapixels and a f/2.2 aperture, while the front camera has 5 megapixels with a special soft-selfie mode, demonstrated on Xiaomi’s website by members of Chinese idol pop group SNH48 , plus Xiaomi’s Smart Beauty 3.0 feature with face recognition. The pop group have been promoting the phone since before its launch, and also appear in the promotional video.. A Snapdragon 625 processor powers the phone, and you have the choice between a model with 3GB or 4GB of RAM. The 4GB Redmi 5 Plus comes with 64GB of storage space, and the 3GB version has 32GB. A big 4,000mAh battery should keep the phone running all day and a while longer, but it makes the phone quite heavy at 180 grams, but it’s still relatively slim at 8mm. Android 7.0 Nougat is installed and customized with MIUI 9, Xiaomi’s own user interface. Other features include a MicroSD card slot and a 3.5mm headphone jack.. The Redmi 5 is a great looking phone, at a very cheap price — exactly what we want from Xiaomi and the Redmi range. The front has a 5.7-inch, 18:9 aspect ratio screen with the same curved edge design as the 5 Plus, and the same color selection is available for the body. The screen resolution is lower than the 5 Plus at 1,440 x 720.. Power is delivered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 and either 2GB or 3GB of RAM. If you chose the basic 2GB model it comes with 16GB of storage space, while the 3GB model has 32GB. The Redmi 5 has the same camera setup as the 5 Plus with a 12-megapixel camera on the back, and a 5-megapixel selfie camera on the front. A 3,300mAh battery, a 3.5mm headphone jack, Google Android 7.0 Nougat, and Xiaomi’s MIUI 9 user interface complete the specification list.. Being a little smaller, and with a smaller battery, means the Redmi 5 is slightly thinner than the 5 Plus at 7.7mm and lighter at 157 grams. Otherwise, the two phones are the same design..

Please enable JavaScript to view comments.. Xiaomi Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus Sport 18:9 Displays, Start at $120 in China. After weeks of leaks and sneak previews , Xiaomi on Wednesday finally took the wraps off its latest budget smartphones in China: The Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus. They’re the successors to last year’s Redmi 4 and Redmi 4X , and they pack a few major improvements over predecessor while retaining their budget-friendly appeal.. The phones are identical to each other in terms of design and both run Xiaomi’s Android 7.1.2 Nougat -based MIUI 9 skin, but they differ in terms of under-the-hood hardware — namely, the chipset, battery, and memory. Here’s everything you need to know.. Both the Redmi 5 and its big brother, the 5 Plus, have a taller-than-average aspect ratio — a first for Xiaomi’s budget lineup — which lends them premium, modern aesthetics not dissimilar to OnePlus 5T and LG V30 .. The Redmi 5, for its part, packs a 5.7-inch HD+ LCD display with a resolution of 1440 x 720 and an aspect ratio of 18:9. On the inside, it’s powered by the Qualcomm 450 octa-core system-on-a-chip (SoC), which features two clusters of 4x Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.8GHz frequency coupled with Adreno 506 GPU.. In the camera department, the Redmi 5 has a 12MP f/2.2 shooter with a 1.25-micron pixel size, phase detection autofocus, and an LED flash module. Meanwhile, the front camera’s a 5MP sensor with a front flash that helps users capture selfies in low-light conditions.. To power all those components, the handset packs a 3,300mAh capacity battery, a slight step down from the Redmi 4’s 4,100mAh battery. But thanks to the power-efficient Snapdragon 450 chipset (built on Samsung’s 14nm FinFET process) and software optimizations, Xiaomi says the phone lasts up to two days on a single charge..

When compared to the 4A, the phones are hardly different. It's similar to the relationship between the OnePlus 5T and OnePlus 5 .. It's something of a cosmetic update.. What still keeps the Redmi 5A on top of the competition is its hardware. Xiaomi has announced that the 2GB RAM and 16GB storage variant will be up for grabs at Rs 4,999 for the first 5 million units, thereafter, the price will revert to the original, Rs 5,999. On the other hand, the 3GB RAM and 32GB storage variant will continue to retail at Rs 6,999.. So, can the Redmi 5A can be the perfect smartphone for people on a tight budget? Let's find out.. The 2GB RAM + 16GB storage variant is priced at INR 4,999 for the first five million units, post which, it will be available for INR 5,999. The 3GB RAM + 32GB storage variant is priced at INR 6,999.. The Redmi 5A went on sale at noon on December 7, across Flipkart, Mi.com, and Mi Home stores. As per recent reports, you may soon be able to purchase the 3GB RAM variant of the Redmi 5A from offline retailers by paying a premium of Rs 500, bringing the total price up to Rs 7,499.. The Redmi 5A features a unibody design with a metallic finish on top of a good quality plastic back. It looks identical to its other Redmi counterparts, and feels like a shrunken Redmi 4. The sides are metallic, which packs it firmly, hence it feels pretty sturdy to hold. It weighs 137 grams and measures 140.4 x 70.1 x 8.4 mm, which makes it a pretty handy device.. Similar to the Redmi 4A, it has the front camera, earpiece and ambient light sensor on the top of the display. The capacitive navigation keys are right below the display, which unfortunately isn't backlit. Power/lock key is on the right, accompanied by the volume rocker. On the left edge, there are two trays — one for dual SIM cards and another dedicated to the microSD card.. The Redmi 5A sports an IR blaster on the top, alongside a secondary mic.. On the bottom, there's a micro USB port with the primary microphone and the top of the phone houses a 3.5mm audio jack and an IR blaster, which is a feature many want. On the back panel, there's the primary camera, LED flash on the top left corner and the speaker grill is at the bottom, which also has a tiny protrusion to avoid audio blockage when the phone is placed on its back.. Overall, the design and build are nothing extraordinary for those who've seen the 4A, but it's commendable for a device this cheap. It is handy, fits perfectly in pockets and doesn't feel bulky despite having a relatively big battery.. The Redmi 5A sports a 5-inch HD IPS LCD display with 720x1280 pixel resolution. When I compared this display with other budget smartphones in the same price range, the handset that came closest to this phone was the Redmi 4 itself. While the Redmi 4 has a sharper and punchier display, the Redmi 5A's display fits the bill for this price.. The pixel density does come to 296 pixels per inch though, which means you'll struggle to spot any pixelation, unless you're very close to the screen.. Colors look rich and vivid and can be tweaked using a manual adjustment in the display settings. Moreover, it offers a night mode for a comfortable reading experience in darkness, which is rare in this range.. The display, while not revolutionary, offers a new standard in the ultra-budget range. It offers good sunlight visibility and we reckon this will be a norm for budget buyers soon.. Next Page Battery life and camera.

Xiaomi Redmi 5A: Hands on and first impressions. by Abhishek Baxi November 30, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Operating System: Android 7.1 Nougat with MIUI 9. Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 (Quad-core 1.4GHz) | Adreno 308 GPU. Display: 5-inch HD (1280 x 720) IPS display. Internal Storage: 16/32 GB; expandable up to 128GB with microSD card. Rear Camera: 13 MP with LED flash | ƒ/2.2 aperture | 1.12 μm pixel size | PDAF. Front Camera: 5 MP | ƒ/2.0 aperture | 1.12 μm. Dimensions: 140 x 70.1 x 8.35 mm. The Redmi series continues to do well for Xiaomi, and has established the company as the top smartphone maker in markets like India.. With the new Redmi 5A, Xiaomi brings to the table another budget smartphone – a segment it revels in. A successor to the Redmi 4A launched in March this year, the Redmi 5A is almost the same device and you’d be hard pressed to find any major difference between the two.. I spent some time with the Redmi 5A before the launch, and here are my initial thoughts about the same.. At first glance, the Redmi 5A looks like the quintessential Xiaomi smartphone, similar to many Redmi phones that we’ve seen in the past. There’s nothing new, and that’s not a bad thing.. The Redmi 5A sports a polycarbonate body with a metallic matte finish that looks quite polished. It’s all plastic, yes, but doesn’t feel cheap. With a 5-inch display and 8.35mm of thickness, it is a compact smartphone that sits comfortably in your hand.. One of the obvious omissions on the Redmi 5A is a fingerprint sensor. While these are increasingly getting ubiquitous on even budget smartphones, it is fair to cut corners in a smartphone at this price.. Xiaomi has finally listened to the demands of a vocal niche that doesn’t prefer the hybrid SIM tray, and the Redmi 5A comes with a 2+1 card slot which allows you to use two nano SIMs and a microSD card to expand the storage all at once.. The Redmi 5A boasts of a 5-inch fully-laminated HD (1280 × 720) IPS display which offers good color reproduction and contrast. It’s duller than what Xiaomi offers on its more expensive smartphone, and the vibrancy is a casualty of the price. The text and images look sharp though, so there’s no complaint on that front.. There’s also a Read Mode that reduces the amount of blue light emitted by the screen to prevent eye fatigue at nights or during long reading sessions.. Like its predecessor, the Redmi 4A is powered by the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 chipset paired with 2 GB of RAM. There’s 16 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 128GB using a microSD card. There’s also a higher memory variant with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage.. The Snapdragon 425 is a good choice at this price as it has enough muscle for a decent Android experience and is quite power efficient. The performance is good enough for a budget smartphone, and multitasking and web browsing were quite smooth – although I really didn’t try it in many real-world scenarios with a multitude of third-party apps that one would do typically.. The initial impressions were quite good and promising, but several budget smartphones with limited innards tend to have a performance decay after 6 months or so. I’ll delve on this more when I take the device for a spin for a longer period of time for the complete review.. The Redmi 5A is powered by a 3,000 mAh battery underneath, which is actually lesser than 3,120 mAh found on the Redmi 4A but sufficient for what should be a day long battery life.. The Redmi 5A runs MIUI 9 which is based on Android 7.1 Nougat. There’s no word on the timeline for Android Oreo upgrade since Xiaomi prefers to maintain its own cycle of upgrades defined by MIUI versions.. While there’s a big camp of Android users that prefer stock Android experience, there are also fans of customized UI layers that several OEMs ship their phones with.. Xiaomi’s MIUI is one of the more popular …. While the Android skins are a matter of personal preference and several users prefers just stock Android, MIUI is fairly popular. MIUI 9 offers one of the more intuitive and functional UIs, and there are nifty utilities and tools that improve one’s overall Android experience.. In the photography department, the Redmi 4A offers a 13-megapixel rear snapper with f/2.2 aperture and phase-detection auto-focus (PDAF). On the front, there’s an improved 5-megapixel camera with f/2.0 aperture.. While I’ll reserve my judgement on the camera till the review, a few test shots in daylight came out quite well for a phone at this price. There’s nothing exceptional about the camera as per the initial testing, just that it is better than most of the competition so a fair win for Xiaomi in the segment.. The 2 GB + 16 GB variant of the Redmi 5A is priced at ₹4,999 ($78) while the 3 GB + 32 GB variant is priced at ₹6,999 ($109). The price of the lower spec’d variant is discounted for first five million units, post which the price will be ₹5,999, but for those five million customers, it’s a steal, really.. The Redmi 5A is not an upgrade to the other budget smartphones by Xiaomi released this year, but a well-rounded budget smartphone at the moment that would expectedly sell quite well. It’s an affordable package that offers decent smartphone experience without too many compromises. You get what you pay for, right?. Xiaomi , Xiaomi Redmi 5A. Please enter a valid email address.

Xiaomi Redmi 5, Redmi 5 Plus & Redmi Note 5 Info Leaks. October 25, 2017 - Written By Kristijan Lucic. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5’s announcement seems to be right around the corner, as the phone got certified in China quite recently, and some new info regarding the device, and its siblings, just surfaced. The Redmi Note 5 has been popping up all over the place, and this new rumor claims that Xiaomi actually plans to introduce three ‘full-screen’ Redmi-branded smartphones in the near future, the Redmi 5, Redmi 5 Plus and Redmi Note 5.. Now, as per this rumor, all three handsets will sport a display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, though their specs and display size will differ, of course. The Redmi 5 is rumored to sport a 5.5-inch HD+ (1440 x 720) display, which is quite interesting considering that its predecessors shipped with a 5-inch panel, but considering the fact that this phone will probably have considerably thinner bezels, and a display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, it should not be that much bigger than the Redmi 4, for example, if it will be bigger at all. The Redmi 5 Plus and Redmi Note 5 are said to sport 5.9-inch fullHD+ (2160 x 1080) displays, which is rather interesting, especially for the Redmi 5 Plus, as one would assume that it will sport the same display size as the regular Redmi 5 handset.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. The Xiaomi Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus will not differ only in the display department, according to the source, the two phones will also sport different storage configurations. The REdmi 5 is said to sport 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, while its ‘Plus’ variant will arrive with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of native storage. The Redmi 5 Plus will be fueled by the Helio P25 64-bit octa-core SoC, and it will, allegedly, cost 1,099 Yuan ($165). Now, it is possible that some, or all of these phones will arrive in two SoC variants, MediaTek and Snapdragon variants, though the source does not mention that. The Redmi Note 5 will, however, probably ship with the Snapdragon 636 64-bit octa-core SoC, and it is expected to cost around 1,599 Yuan ($240). Do take all of this info with a grain of salt, as some details don’t exactly make all that much sense, like the display size difference between the Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus. The Redmi Note 5 is expected to launch on November 11 , at least according to a recent leak, so it is possible that all three phones will be announced on that date.. Buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4.

Xiaomi Redmi 5, Redmi 5 Plus revealed; feature 18:9 aspect ratio displays and new colour options. Dec 04, 2017 18:09 PM IST. While Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 4 and the Redmi 4 rule the roost when it comes to the entry-level to budget smartphones segment, there is a new contender on the block, that not only delivers similar hardware, but also a 18:9 display. Well, it still comes from Xiaomi, but that new 18:9 display will surely add a modern touch to the entry-budget segment offering from the brand, making for an attractive package.. Xiaomi has yet to announce these budget beauties at its launch event set for 7 December in China. But fortunately, we will not have to wait that long as Xiaomi global spokesperson, Donovan Sung has already shared four images that reveal what these new smartphones will look like.. The sneak preview that comes from Sung’s tweet. reveals devices that looks quite similar to the currently available Redmi 4. The tweets also reveal that there will be two models, a standard one called the Redmi 5 and. a bigger smartphone called the Redmi 5 Plus with a bigger display (and a bigger battery, possibly).. Both smartphones seem to sport taller 18:9 displays, which is a trend among smartphone makers these days.. From the images one can tell that Redmi 5 and 5 Plus seem to follow the same formula as the Redmi 4, with a metal back and a fingerprint reader at the rear and colour-matched plastic caps at the top. In the case of the Redmi 5, the chassis too seem to be made of plastic as you can see in the images below. As for the colour options, there appears to be a new sky blue finish apart from the usual black and rose gold finishes.. The major difference here is the presence of the new taller displays that as per previous reports will arrive in HD+ and full HD+ resolutions. The displays as seen in the press renders also come with rounded corners like on the bigger Mi Mix 2 model.. Sung did not reveal any specifications of the two devices yet, so for now we are still stuck with the details we have seen from Chinese regulator TENAA.. According the TENAA listings , the Redmi 5 is expected to arrive with an HD+ (1440x720 pixels) resolution, 5.7-inch display with an overall smaller form-factor thanks to its smaller bezels.. Inside the smartphone is expected to feature a 1.8 GHz octa-core SoC which could be the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 or 625 platforms. The device is expected to arrive with 2 GB + 16 GB, 3 GB + 32 GB and 4 GB + 64 GB RAM and internal storage variants and pack in 12 MP rear + 5 MP front-facing camera combo.. The above is expected to be powered by a 3,200 mAh battery on the Redmi 5.. As for the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus, expected it to arrive with an even bigger display, a 4,000 mAh+ battery with a Snapdragon 600 series SOC.. Both smartphones are set to be launched on 7 December, so we will have to patiently wait a bit longer till the final specifications list is out. As for the pricing, just like the Redmi 4 before, it expect them to be priced between the entry-level and budget segment (expected between Rs 7000 - Rs 14,000).. Published Date: Dec 04, 2017 18:03 PM. | Updated Date: Dec 04, 2017 18:09 PM. Xiaomi Redmi 5, Redmi Note 5 and Mi TV launched at Rs 9,999, Rs 12,999 and Rs 39,999 respectively.
