We have been hearing about the Galaxy C10, which is touted to be the first Dual-camera phone from Samsung.. As seen in the image, the Galaxy C10 gets a metal unibody design with a dual tone LED flash accompanying the main cameras. The Antenna bands are also visible on the back of the device with a soft curve on back panel for easy holding. The back panel also gets Samsung branding right beneath the dual camera setup.. Pricebaba already tracks all phones with dual-camera , right from Huawei, LG, Micromax to Apple, everyone has a dual-camera offering out already. Unlike Apple, Samsung didn’t manage to get a dual-camera setup in their latest flagship, the Galaxy S8 & S8 Plus. However, the C10 introduces dual-cameras to Samsung’s lineup.. The C10 is expected to feature a 5.5” display with the following dimensions: 152.5 x 74.8 x 7.68mm. At 7.68mm, the C10 is somewhat thicker than the C9 Pro which is at 6.9mm. Consistent with the Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro , the power button is on the right and the volume controls are on the left. There is an additional button under the volume rocker, rumoured to be for Bixby! The antenna lines on the metal body, USB Type-C port and fingerprint sensor along with the home button on the front are also in line with the C9 Pro.. Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Dual Sim.

more ... more .... more ... more .... Samsung Galaxy C10, Galaxy C10 Plus to be equipped with Bixby and the Bixby button?. Samsung Galaxy C10, Galaxy C10 Plus to be equipped with Bixby and the Bixby button?. by Alan Friedman. Tags :. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. There has been plenty of speculation stating that the first Samsung handset to feature a dual-camera setup will be the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. While the high-end phablet is a good bet to carry two cameras on the back, it is looking increasingly likely as though another pair of Galaxy handsets will beat it to the punch. And that would be the Samsung Galaxy C10 and Samsung Galaxy C10 Plus. A sketch of the former shows that the two cameras will be positioned vertically , in the center of the rear cover. It also appears as though the Galaxy C10 (SM-C9100) and Galaxy C10 Plus (SM-C9150/C9158) will both be offering something else, the infamous Bixby button. A cover that reportedly has been produced for the Galaxy C10 reveals a cut out strategically placed exactly where that button would be. Samsung does plan on launching Bixby on more models than just the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+; where you find Bixby, you'll find a dedicated Bixby button. The AI assistant will allow you to control your phone by using voice commands. Anything you can do with touch on an app, can be done using your voice with Bixby. It also is contextually aware and more conversational. The AI assistant can also understand what you are saying, even if your sentences are not complete. Bixby Vision describes what you are focusing the camera on. It will also tell you where you can buy that item, and give you prices from various retailers carrying that product. Other than the rumored dual-camera setup on the back of the phones, and the Bixby button on the side, all we know about the Galaxy C10 and Galaxy C10 Plus is that both are believed to be powered by the recently unveiled Snapdragon 660 chipset. source: @UniverseIce via SamMobile.

Rumor: Samsung Galaxy C10, Galaxy C10 Plus To Launch In 2017. May 8, 2017 - Written By Dominik Bosnjak. Samsung Electronics is currently developing the Galaxy C10 and Galaxy C10 Plus and is planning to launch both devices later this year, industry sources said on Monday. The Galaxy C10 is said to bear the model number SM-C9100, while the Galaxy C10 Plus is expected to launch as the SM-C9150/SM-C9158, sources state, which doesn’t perfectly corroborate a report from earlier today according to which the Galaxy C10 is meant to carry the model number. Regardless of the specifics, the sheer number of newly emerged rumors on the matter suggest that the South Korean consumer electronics manufacturer is working on new additions to its upper mid-range smartphone lineup.. According to the same report, it’s still unclear whether Samsung will opt to launch the more expensive variant of its upcoming smartphone as the galaxy C10 Plus or the Galaxy C10 Pro. The former moniker denotes the company’s new flagship smartphone, though the latter is a hallmark of its Galaxy C product family, so it remains to be seen how exactly will the device be called. Regardless, as both handsets are meant to succeed the Galaxy C9 Pro that was launched in late 2016, industry watchers speculate that they’ll feature at least 6GB of RAM, just like their predecessor did. The same goes for screen real estate as the upcoming smartphones likely won’t offer anything smaller than the 6-inch display panel that debuted on the Galaxy C9 Pro.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. While the Seoul-based tech giant is said to be launching the Galaxy C10 and the Galaxy C10 Plus at some point this year, no specific release windows have been mentioned by industry insiders so far, though Q4 2017 seems like the most reasonable prediction. Likewise, the devices shouldn’t be much more expensive than their predecessor that launched in India with prices starting at. 36,900 rupees, which translates to approximately $570. Given Samsung’s previous release strategy for smartphones that belong in the upper mid-range segment of the market, it’s unlikely that the upcoming Galaxy C10 and the Galaxy C10 Plus will ever be released in the West. Half a year after its official launch, the Galaxy C9 Pro is still only available in China and India, and the South Korean phone maker will likely target those same markets once again later this year..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Samsung's Note 8 might not be its first dual-camera phone. An alleged leaked image shows the Galaxy C10 hosting two rear cameras.. May 18, 2017 12:08 PM PDT. While Samsung fans await the company's next premium phone, the Galaxy Note 8 , it seems like a different phone may steal some of the Note's thunder. The next Galaxy C series phone, assumed to be called the Galaxy C10, is rumored to get dual cameras. If this speculation pans out, this would make it Samsung's first phone with the feature, and not the Note 8 (which is also rumored to sport a dual-camera setup).. The rumor gained steam after a couple of alleged renderings and case leaks showed that the device with two rear cameras. We can't independently confirm the authenticity of these leaks (especially this one, which isn't even trying that hard ), and Samsung declined to comment. For these reasons, it's best to take these rumors with a grain of salt.. Dual rear cameras are becoming more common on premium flagship phones like the Apple iPhone 7 Plus , LG G6 and Huawei P9. But despite the feature's growing popularity, Samsung has yet to make a dual-camera phone.. There is some evidence, however, that the company is at least interested in the idea. In March, Samsung tweeted that its new Exynos 9 chip supports dual-camera capabilities. And past prototypes of the Galaxy S8 that surfaced before its release showed the device with two cameras.. Despite Samsung's Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series being way more popular than its Galaxy C series, phones within the C-family can hold their own in terms of specs. The Galaxy C9 Pro , for example, was the first Samsung phone to pack 6GB of RAM. It also features Qualcomm's Snapdragon 653 processor and has a 6-inch display..

more ... more .... more ... more .... Samsung Galaxy C10 to be the first Samsung phone with a dual camera setup?. Samsung Galaxy C10 to be the first Samsung phone with a dual camera setup?. by Alan Friedman. Tags :. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. Earlier this month, we told you that there was speculation that the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 would NOT be the first Samsung branded phone to carry a dual camera setup. Instead, the buzz around the water cooler was that a new Samsung handset in the Galaxy C line would be first across the finish line with the dual snappers, which would be vertically positioned on back. Today, that phone 's name was finally revealed in a pair of tweets disseminated this morning. According to a source out of China, the first Samsung handset to carry a dual camera setup will be the Samsung Galaxy C10. The model number of the device is SM-C9150. And powering this handset will be the new Snapdragon 660 SoC, which is supposed to be unveiled by Qualcomm on May 9th. That happens to be this coming Tuesday. And how about this boys and girls! The Galaxy C10 will reportedly include its very own dedicated Bixby button, just like the button found on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy S8+ .The same source who furnished this information also tweeted a sketch of the rear of the Galaxy C10 a few days ago. The sketch failed to show a fingerprint scanner on back, which means that it is either embedded in the home button like on other Samsung models, or embedded in the screen. Since the technology to do the latter has been problematic, the home button seems the best place for the fingerprint reader at this point. source: ammddj_china ( 1 ), ( 2 ) via DroidHolic.

I check that leaker twitter (@mmddj_china), and it's just full of overwatch fanart, 772 followers, self proclaimed "Famous leaker in China", badly photoshopped phone, and his tweet rarely get re-tweeted (probably once in every 20 posts). is this leaker even legit? :-/. (Posts: 2194; Member since: 09 Nov 2015). posted on 07 May 2017, 13:54. Ah! C10, eh...? I hope its not 2.5 times stronger than "C4"...!. Anyhow, seems like Samsung is about to unveil a camera focused smartphone, a successor of the ill-fated Galaxy S4 Zoom... With not "THAT" much 'zoom' capabilities, of course... The Zoom was basically a digital camera on steroids... (Posts: 219; Member since: 11 Apr 2017). posted on 07 May 2017, 03:28. surprised samdung didnt release the galaxy s8 with dual cameras.. (Posts: 18; Member since: 02 Aug 2016). posted on 07 May 2017, 04:41. Even Samsung's single camera can easily f**k down all your dual camera in the market... So I think there is no need of dual camera until Samsung's single camera can outperform all dual camera setups in market. In future when samsung will use a dual camera setup it will make sense....

(Posts: 3960; Member since: 21 Oct 2014). posted on 07 May 2017, 18:09. in response to #16 Hide. Only your 3rd post and you've already gone full retard... (Posts: 14; Member since: 05 Oct 2012). posted on 07 May 2017, 05:39. "Even Samsung's single camera can easily f**k down all your dual camera in the market...". Let me enlighten you a bit. The concept of a dual camera is not to increase the quality of the optics of a phone. Rather it is to assist the primary camera in performing various tasks for example, better colour representation ( huawei's implementation), better field of view ( LG's implementation ), better portraits ( Apple's implementation ) etc... So pls do tell me, does the s8's camera outperform the g6's in terms of field of view? How about the iPhone 7 plus in terms of quality of portraits?. (Posts: 1662; Member since: 01 Nov 2016). posted on 07 May 2017, 07:26. Quality of portraits yes, field of view no. Quality is subjective and I feel blur ability of the s6/7/8 has been on par with the 7+. (Posts: 56; Member since: 11 Sep 2013). posted on 07 May 2017, 07:59. Dxo mark the best phone camera on the market is the pixel followed by the galaxy s7 they are both not duel camera smart phones.

(Posts: 1536; Member since: 22 Apr 2014). posted on 07 May 2017, 07:56. I visited a Air Force base this weekend and I got some great shots with the my S8+, the background blur effect works really well but I can say there were sometimes that I wished I had LG'S setup because there wasn't enough room to get some of the fighter planes in the entire shot.

This is apparently the Samsung Galaxy C10, the company’s first dual camera phone. Adrian Diaconescu May 29, 2017 5:15 am. It hasn’t been a secret for quite some time now that Samsung was basically forced to choose between an “Infinity Display” and dual rear-facing camera setup for final Galaxy S8 and S8+ designs due to the reported failure of embedding a fingerprint sensor directly in the two’s screens.. As popular as the iPhone 7 Plus may have proven thanks to its separate wide-angle and telephoto 12MP lenses, Samsung’s call was obviously made easy by the years and years of waiting for so-called “bezelless” mobile devices .. But that doesn’t explain why there’s no other dual cam Galaxy around. After all, the feature has rapidly become a must even for today’s mid-rangers. Asus , ZTE and Gionee are only a few of the companies ready to sell such photographic monsters on a tight budget, and before long, Motorola will join them .. Meanwhile, the impending Samsung Galaxy C10 doesn’t exactly sound or look like a bargain, but it should still be substantially cheaper than the Note 8 , not to mention earlier to market. To the Chinese market, at least, following in the footsteps of other extravagant “mid-rangers” like. the C5 , C7 , C9 Pro , C7 Pro and C5 Pro .. The C10 is surprisingly rumored to be sporting a smaller 5.5-inch screen than both the 5.7-inch C7 Pro and 6-inch C9 Pro. Its bezels are there, not too thick but not too thin, accommodating a “standard” physical home button doubling as a decently placed fingerprint reader.. CAD renders and a nice 360-degree video also reveal some interesting antenna lines (full metal jacket for the win!), a USB Type-C port, side-mounted Bixby button (!!!), and most importantly, those two rear cams Samsung fans must be drooling over, displayed vertically and accompanied by a dual LED flash structure..
