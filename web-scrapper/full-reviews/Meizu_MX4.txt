more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Chris P.. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction Meizu has been slinging flagship devices at the market for years now, but those have been having a hard time sticking around in meaningful quantities. This is specifically true as of late as local rival Xiaomi has been showering itself in glory, overshadowing Meizu in the process. Now, with the MX4 , Meizu is ready to try again. Plenty is on offer with this phone , including a large, 5.4-inch display, an octa-core processor, and a 21 MP camera – all powered by a 3100 mAh battery. For this, you'll have to whip out $449, but don't expect to find it on the shelves of your local brick and mortar. That said, practice has shown that devices like this find their way to the States and elsewhere, and there's always Meizu's international online store, which offers free express shipping and covers any import taxes you might incur. So does the attractive price tag and the seemingly infallible specs make the MX4 a competitive device ? Let's find out! Design This thing is sturdy and sits nicely in the hand, but we wish Meizu spent a little more time styling the rear. The Meizu MX4 packs a 5.4-inch screen that's plenty large. So how big of a device are we talking about? At 5.67 x 2.96 x 0.35 inches (144 x 75.2 x 8.9 mm), the MX4 is slightly smaller than the equally-trimmed LG G3 , which is great news. The MX4 is also fairly light, at 5.19 oz (147 g), and that's always good news. The MX4 nevertheless feels very solid in the hand, and matches your palm nicely due to that rounded back, so overall ergonomics are excellent – not least because Meizu has done an excellent job trimming any excess fat with the bezels. The materials used with the phone are well-selected as well – we've got a metal frame, within which the device is nestled, and an especially soft plastic shell at the rear. Metal is also used with the power and volume keys, both of which provide excellent tactile feedback, though the former is awkwardly-located at the top – a problem with as large a device. Overall, we can't say that the MX4 won us over with its exterior – it's not bad by any and all means, but the rear shell is kind of unsightly. Display A very bright, 15:9 display with some acceptable weaknesses. An extra large, 5.36-inch IPS screen by Sharp or JDI (depending on the batch) is what the MX4 has going on. The resolution is rather odd, at 1152 x 1920 (15:9), good for the excellent 418 pixels per inch. For protection, Meizu is using a Corning Gorilla Glas 3 cover, which should safeguard against scratches and even small drops. Thankfully, this also means that the surface of the display is coated with an oleophobic solution, meaning that oily fingerprints are minimized. Also excellent are the maximum and minimum levels of brightness the display can produce – 535 and 2 nits, respectively. These figures are corroborated by our own findings – reading the screen outside, even with the sun over our shoulder, was easy, and the extremely low brightness of the panel also allowed for a comfortable viewing during the night. As for the screen's color reproduction, we're looking at acceptable deviations from the target, though the color temperature, at 7778 K (6500 K is the reference here), is a bit too high, which results in a bluish overcast that is especially visible with whites and grays. The display's coldness is not its only drawback, though, as gamma, at 2.01, is also sub-par (2.2 is ideal).. 5.67 x 2.96 x 0.35 inches. 144 x 75.2 x 8.9 mm. 5.76 x 2.94 x 0.35 inches. 146.3 x 74.6 x 8.9 mm. 5.75 x 2.83 x 0.29 inches. 146 x 72 x 7.3 mm. 5.48 x 2.7 x 0.35 inches. 139.2 x 68.5 x 8.9 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

Slower in benchmarks, slower in cam speed, basically cant keep up. The price might be amazing but for a European who has to pay taxes importing it, then worrying for warranty which is back in China is just a phone for Chinese market and should not be considered by anyone outside of China. (Posts: 375; Member since: 28 Jan 2014). posted on 02 Oct 2014, 10:48. Except this chip is about half the price of a Snapdragon 801. And this might not be a great buy from China because they upped the price too much but there are plenty other devices that are both cheaper and faster. It is a pitty thogh that you feel the need to trumpet your nonsense, go play with your icrap and let us be.. (Posts: 1728; Member since: 30 Jul 2013). posted on 02 Oct 2014, 11:00. I am more than fine with 4.4.4 official update from my moto on my 2013 moto X. If you cant accept the facts that best of media tek cant compete with best of qualcomm in terms of performance then thats not my fault. Not to mention how awful mediatek is when it comes to giving driver updates to the OEM's for them to update to latest android..

I feel that is a deliberate crime to show color temperature of Z3 to the preadjusted 10324K. and compare it with it, although it has the ability to move it as close as can be to the. "ideal" 6500K using the display settings color temperature adjusting feature. [ to red 250 /green 190 /blue 0 as you guys said before here http://tinyurl.com/pkcoqon].

Ye thing is they do the reviews with auto settings, they dont change them to favor any phone. With proper manual camera settings you can take a photo from a mediocre phone better than a high end if you play enough. Thats not a point and thats why they dont change them,.

Its a very simple thing, it's not a thousand different adjustments that you can make with a camera. (Posts: 567; Member since: 27 Jun 2013). posted on 02 Oct 2014, 11:52. Meizu says on their site that they'll cover the import tax and ship through DHL for free. You're also a bit off on a few points about the MT chip. For one, cam speed has a lot to do with the size of the picture (21MP here). As you can see if you compare it with the Xperia Z3, it is as fast (or slow), despite touting an SD801. As I noted in the review, navigation is buttery smooth, and even the more demanding games are rendered perfectly fine. We need to do away with this preconception that MediaTek just always has to suck.. (Posts: 1867; Member since: 16 Jan 2011). posted on 02 Oct 2014, 21:50. Agreed, Mediatek is catching up and why wouldn't they considering they are using the patented ARM design for big little.. Good to see Antutu is utilising all those cores too, the benchmarks and real world phone use (being buttery smooth) prove that its more than a mid ranger. I've been watching Meizu for some time, I'm pretty sure they're about ready for the global market with the MX4 :). (Posts: 163; Member since: 27 Aug 2013). posted on 02 Oct 2014, 09:55. I feel mediatek cheat on Antutu ~. (Posts: 1171; Member since: 21 Nov 2011). posted on 02 Oct 2014, 11:18. A per core benchmark is more telling when you want to see just how powerful a cpu is. Antutu combines GPU and CPU scores for one cumulative score. An octa-core chipset will fly on Antutu compared to something that rates each individual core or the GPU alone.. (Posts: 104; Member since: 04 May 2012). posted on 02 Oct 2014, 10:07. why there is no cons of "No microSD card slot" in iphone 6 review but you consider this in MX4 review O.o.

Beside people like tech geeks in sites like phonearena are the only ones who complain abou it. A normal person who has no idea what android 4.4.4 is or what root is will never give a xxxx about SD.. (Posts: 1867; Member since: 16 Jan 2011). posted on 02 Oct 2014, 21:52. in response to #24 Hide. "A normal person who has no idea what android 4.4.4 is or what root is will never give a xxxx about SD...". This counts for about 95% of the world population.. (Posts: 808; Member since: 29 Oct 2013). posted on 02 Oct 2014, 10:27. In my opinion, this looks much better than the phone that bends ;).

A lot of of phones are made in China, including the iPhone. A lot of electronics in your house could also be made in China.

The Bottom Line The Meizu MX4 may have the looks to stand toe-to-toe with the flagships -- as long as you like its squarish shape -- but its buggy software and poor performance mean you should steer clear for now.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Design The sides are very much like the iPad Air. The screen is visible even in bright sunlight. The keyboard isn't easy to use. Unlike more established Chinese brands such as Xiaomi or OnePlus , you've probably never heard of Meizu. The Beijing-based company has been building smartphones for a while now, and the MX4 is the company's fourth device -- and quite a stand-out it it too, with a unique 5.4-inch display with a 5:3 aspect ratio, much squarer than most phones.. Inside, however, the story is more troubling. Battery life and camera quality are disappointing and operating system is riddled with bugs. Also, while the MX4 comes with 4G LTE connectivity, it isn't compatible with networks in the US. It should, however, be compatible with high-speed networks of both EE and Three in the UK and Optus in Australia.. Available at online retailers such as Gearbest in the US, the MX4 costs $449 for the 16GB model and $489 for the 32GB version. It's available via Amazon in the UK for £300 for 16GB or £304 for 32GB (why would you buy the 16GB one?). Australians will have to import the phone, with the US prices converting to AU$510 and AU$555, respectively. At this point, however, there are too many niggling problems to recommend it at that price.. Meizu's MX4 phone looks like the iPad Air (pictures). Sporting an Apple-inspired design, the MX4 looks just like a smaller iPad. Meizu has even added a circular home button on the front that hints at Apple's Touch ID buttons. The button isn't a fingerprint sensor, but it does light up like an arc reactor to alert you to notifications.. Turn the MX4 on its side to see even more evidence of the Apple influence. The edges are chamfered like the iPad Air , but the rounded edges have a plastic lining like the iPhone. On its backside, a curved plate makes the MX4 comfortable to hols. Unlike the glossy design of the MX3 , the MX4 goes for a matte grey color, darker than Apple's devices. Underneath the removable cover, there's a non-removable 3,100mAh battery, and a slot for the SIM card.. Instead of your usual smartphone display with a 16:9 aspect ratio, the MX4 has a strange 5:3 ratio and a resolution of 1,920x1,152 pixels crammed into its 5.4 inches -- slightly more than a full HD screen. It's certainly unexpected, but the execution is poor. It doesn't work well on the MX4 -- but more on that in a minute.. On the upside, viewing angles were great and colors were vibrant. The screen is bright enough to use outdoors under sunlight. The only thing I had an issue with was that the phone sometimes didn't quite seem to adjust correctly to the amount of light in the area, and ends up being a shade too dim. You'll have to manually tweak it instead.. I don't really see the 5:3 screen as something that really sells the phone -- at least not for me. There doesn't seem to be any extra usefulness compared with your standard full-HD display. My colleague Lynn La had similarly mixed feelings about the LG Vu's similar 4:3 aspect ratio .. While most flagship phones run on Qualcomm's high-end Snapdragon chips, the MX4 takes a different route with MediaTek's MT6595, an octa-core processor that features four Cortex-A17 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four Cortex-A7 cores clocked at a slower 1.7GHz. For gaming, the MX4 sports a PowerVR G6200 GPU.. For imaging, the MX4 has a rear 20.7-megapixel camera and a 2-megapixel front camera for taking selfies.. Powered by Android 4.4.4 KitKat and running a custom UI called Flyme 4.0, at first glance the MX4 seems capable of offering a unique experience not found on other Android phones.. For one, instead of having only software or hardware keys, the MX4 has a mix of both, the aforementioned circular button for home, and a soft key for back. To access the multi-app window, you just need to swipe up from the bottom of the display.. In theory, this sounds interesting, but in practice it's terribly flawed. Most apps aren't scaled for the display's 5:3 aspect ratio, and the menu button is often missing unless you rotate the phone to landscape mode, which then gives it a little more space at the sides for it to show up.. One example is the hugely popular messaging app WhatsApp. Upon hitting the camera button to take a picture from within the app, you then get trapped in a loop if you don't actually want to take an image. The back button is missing, and hitting X after you press the shutter button returns you to the camera screen. This leaves you with no choice but to either take and send a picture to get out, or to completely shutdown and restart the app.. Another thing I dislike is the custom Flyme keyboard. I've been using the phone for a week now, and I still can't get used to the lack of auto-correct (though it has suggestions) and the odd way of keeping the numbers and signs in two different screens. So if you need to type in something such as "Word5!!!" you'll have to go from the keyboard to the numpad to the symbol section. On that note, it is Android, so you can easily install a better keyboard to replace it.. One major bug that needs to be fixed is that the volume controls don't actually change the phone's ringing volume. Instead they only affect the music volume.. What's more, other apps such as Twitter and Facebook and even the built-in browser constantly crash, necessitating a restart before I could use them again. I once had the Twitter app constantly displaying an error window, leaving me unable to do anything except to restart the phone. The phone has already has an update to fix bugs, mind you, but there's still plenty left.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Xiaomi may be the darling of tech publications when they look to the Chinese smartphone market, but let's not forget that Meizu is the real pioneer of community-centric phone brands. As such, Meizu is sparing no effort to one-up its arch rival with its latest flagship phone, the MX4, as announced in Beijing earlier today. Thanks to the MediaTek MT6595 SoC, we're looking at an octa-core (four 2.2GHz A17 and four 1.7GHz A7) device that can connect to both FDD-LTE and TD-LTE networks right out of the box, thus beating the Xiaomi Mi 4 whose LTE variants aren't due until end of this year. More importantly, the MX4 manages to undercut the 3G-only Mi 4 by about $16 to $33 off-contract, depending on the storage capacity.. Gallery: Meizu MX4 launch | 23 Photos.

Like its predecessor , the MX4's 5.36-inch IPS screen maintains an unorthodox 5:3 aspect ratio, but with a slightly bumped-up resolution of 1,920 x 1,152. Compared to the standard 16:9 smartphones these days, the MX4 benefits from an eye-friendlier home screen as the icons are more spread out, plus the wider body can accommodate a slightly bigger pop-up video player -- a feature on Meizu's Flyme OS 4.0, which is a heavily but prettily customized Android 4.4 ROM -- when you're holding the phone in the usual portrait mode. The screen also takes up 79 percent of the phone's front side and has a narrow 2.6mm bezel, both of which look rather impressive. Meizu added that it's co-developed a screen sealant with Loctite that helps absorb shock impact, in order to reduce the chances of shattering one's screen when the MX4 hits the floor.. Despite the large screen, the MX4 is actually a phone I've enjoyed holding the most in its size category. First of all, it's only 147 grams heavy and 8.9mm thick (yet it still packs a built-in 3,100mAh battery) thanks to its aircraft-grade aluminum body -- one that claims to be harder than that of the iPhone 5s. Secondly, the MX4 carries an ergonomic curvature that's similar to that on the MX3, so there are no edges that would otherwise dig into the palm. To get to the MX4's Micro SIM slot, you can now simply peel off the flexible back cover, as opposed to using a pin to push and peel the hard cover off the MX3. The downside of that is you may feel the seam between the aluminum frame and the plastic cover, so hopefully the final production units will have a tighter fit.. Last but not least, the MX4 packs a 20.7-megapixel f/2.2 main camera and a 2-megapixel f/2.0 front-facing camera. While the latter's resolution is rather disappointing, it does offer a live beautification mode, which lets you preview the enhancements on your eyes, chin and skin before taking selfies. As for the main camera, its 1.2μm pixels will apparently handle dark environments just fine, plus its speedy image signal processor can handle 25 fps continuous shooting in 10-megapixel mode, 720p slow motion capture and even 30 fps 4K video capture. For the icing on the cake, there's a dual tone LED flash for better results when using flash.. The MX4 will be launching on September 20th globally, though only China prices are available at the moment: The 16GB model is just CN¥1,799 (about $290), whereas the 32GB flavor is CN¥1,999 (about $325), and the 64GB model costs CN¥2,399 (about $390). Pretty aggressive, right? And for the record, only the gray edition will be available to begin with, followed by a white edition and a gold edition. Much like the Smartisan T1 , you can also purchase a liquid plus screen protection warranty for just CN¥89 (about $15) per year.. android , china , featured , features , flyme , flyme4.0 , hands-on , meizu , meizumx4 , mobilepostcross , mt6595 , mx4 , phone.

Ubuntu Mobile has found an interesting partner in Meizu, the smartphone brand that has installed the OS on its MX4, which previously ran Android. It has got the hardware, but the software's still not quite ready for the primetime.. digitaltrends.com | By Andy Boxall. Meizu MX4 added 4 new photos .. · 9 December 2014 ·. Meizu MX4 shared Ubuntu Touch 's photo .. · 15 September 2014 ·. Everything You Need to Know About Meizu MX4, the Upcoming Ubuntu Phone – Gallery.. The new Ubuntu Touch operating system from Canonical will power the new Meizu ... MX4 phone and it will be out in December, according to the latest information posted by the Chinese company. We now take a closer look at this new phone to see how it will hold up with an Ubuntu experience.. Canonical hasn't provided any kind of information about a timetable for the launch of the new Ubuntu phone from Meizu, and even the information that we have right now has been posted initially on an Italian blog of the Chinese company. Basically, no one is saying anything officially, but that's not really the point.. The new Meizu MX4 was announced just a couple of weeks ago and many Ubuntu users have asked themselves if this is the phone that will eventually feature the upcoming Ubuntu Touch. It looks like that is the case, so we now take a closer look at this powerful handset.. This is the first phone built by Meizu to feature the new MediaTek MT6595 SoC (system on chip), which is actually a very powerful solution. It's an octa-core, meaning that it's a processor with eight cores, although it's a little bit different from what you would expect. It actually comes with a quad-core 2.2 GHz Cortex A17 processor and a quad-core 1.7 GHz A7 processor, and the devs say that it uses a technology called CorePilot that shifts processes from core to core. This means that the performance of the phone is much better and the battery life is improved dramatically.. "We have made the MX4 compatible with 5 network types across 13 different frequency bands. The MX4 can make use of the latest TD-LTE and FDD-LTE 4G networks, FDD-LTE reaching a download speed of 150 Mbps, almost 6 times that of the previous-generation device," says Meizu on their official website.. Also, Meizu MX4 comes with the 802.11ac Wi-Fi protocol, which registers Internet speeds of up 433 Mbps, a 3100 mAh battery from Sony, a 20.7 mega-pixel SONY premium IMX220 Exmor RS sensor, the NXP Smart PS audio processor, and the PowerVR H6200 GPU. It also comes in two versions, with 16 and 32 GB.. The best feature seems to be the new screen, which features the Nega liquid crystal technology developed with Sharp and JDI that has a size of 5.36 (15:9 ration), 1100:1 contrast ratio, and 500cd/m² for the led backlight.. We are still waiting for an official confirmation from Canonical, but this already looks like a great system to use for Ubuntu Touch.. There is no word about dual-boot or anything along these lines from Meizu, but that remains to be determined.. Meizu MX4 shared Ubuntu Touch 's photo .. · 15 September 2014 ·. Meizu Confirms MX4 Ubuntu Touch Release for December 2014.. Canonical will launch its Ubuntu Touch system on the new Meizu MX4 this December, according to a repo ... rt made by a Meizu Italian blog.. The Ubuntu community has been asking this question ever since the Meizu, Bq, and Canonical partnership was announced. The developers didn't want to provide a clear answer to the launch question and only the launch window was provided, the fall of 2014.. The Ubuntu developers are working to promote an RTM (release to manufacturing) version of Ubuntu Touch and they are almost ready, but it looks like they still have a couple of months, at least, to polish it up. The operating system still needs a few more features, but above all it needs stability.. Meizu MX4 with Ubuntu will arrive in December. Soon after the release of the latest Meizu MX4, the latest device form the Chinese manufactures, there have has been some speculation about the possibility that this might be the phone that will carry the first Ubuntu Touch edition, but there was no way to confirm it.. Now, it looks that Meizu has jumped the gun and they have confirmed before Canonical that they indeed want to make Meizu MX4 the flagship platform for the new operating system.. "Under the request of some fans that have contacted Canonical, they assured us that from December will be available on Ubuntu Touch Meizu MX4 with MediaTek SoC MT 6595. Still no details regarding the variant "pro" of the device, which should be announced in the coming weeks , but we feel pretty confident in saying that the OS will be developed for it, with the timing probably a little more dilated," reads the Meizu Italian blog. This is a rough translation, but the information is pretty clear.. Meizu MX4 is the latest device from the Chinese company and it's an octa-core phones. This is the first one for Meizu with the MediaTek MT6595 and it's much more powerful that the current Nexus 4 development platform. Granted, the Ubuntu developers will have to make some adjustments for the new phone, but it might be a great way for the mobile version of Ubuntu to start its life.. The Meizu MX4 device is already available for pre-order and it comes with the latest Android Kit Kat 4.4.4, but soon users will be able to install Ubuntu on it without any issues..

Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition review: A flagship Linux smartphone. | September 16, 2015 -- 09:13 GMT (17:13 GMT+08:00). Ubuntu presently limits video to 1080p. Glossy white plastic on the back of the 'silver' model. Ubuntu for Phones is not yet a 'prime-time' smartphone OS. In use Stills and video Conclusion. MX4 Ubuntu Edition from Chinese maker Meizu is the second Ubuntu smartphone to reach the market. Originally released for purchase only by linked request and invitation, the MX4 is now available for regular purchase direct from Meizu's website at €299 euros (around £220). Note though, that the MX4 Ubuntu Edition is currently only available within the EU.. Canonical announced plans to port its popular Ubuntu Linux distribution as Ubuntu for Phones in January 2013, and in April this year we reviewed the first Ubuntu phone -- the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition from Spanish manufacturer BQ.. Like the BQ phone, the Meizu MX4 is very much a device for early adopters, since Ubuntu for Phones is still in the development phase. While the €169.90 Aquaris E4.5 is a mid-range phone, the Meizu MX4 delivers considerably more computing power for €299. It runs on a Meizu-customised octa-core MediaTek MT6595 SoC with four ARM Cortex-A17 and four ARM Cortex-A7 cores, with a PowerVR G6200 GPU to handle the graphics, all supported by 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM.. Also like the BQ phone, the Meizu MX4 is an existing model that has had Ubuntu ported to it. The 'parent' version of the MX4 runs the. Flyme operating system, which is based on Android. Various reviewers have said that Flyme is rather buggy so, even in its current form, Ubuntu for Phones may deliver a better experience on this phone. With the Flyme version there's a choice of either 16B or 32GB of internal storage, but the Ubuntu version offers only 16GB. Unlike on the BQ Aquaris 4.5, there is no Micro-SD slot for optional storage expansion.. The Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition has a 5.36-inch (diagonal) display with a resolution of 1,920 by 1,152 pixels, giving a pixel density of 418ppi (the 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus, by contrast, offers 401ppi). The display panel, a joint development between Sharp and JDI, uses NEGA LC (negative dielectric anisotropy liquid crystal) technology, in a twisted nematic design that offers higher performance than the earlier positive TN panels. The MX4 measures 75.2mm wide by 144mm deep by 8.9mm thick.. The Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition smartphone in profile. The Meizu MX4 is a good-looking smartphone that borrows some styling cues from the Samsung Galaxy S6. The aluminium/magnesium alloy frame has softly rounded corners and smoothly rolled edges blending into the shallow curves of the back, so even though it has the width required to accommodate the large display, it sits very comfortably in the hand. It's available in two finishes: matte silver or matte gold. Despite its apparent appearance on the Meizu website, the 'silver' finish device has a glossy white plastic back, which looks as though it will scratch very easily. This entire back cover must be removed to access the Micro-SIM slot -- a fiddly business since there's just one small pry slot and the back is held tenaciously in place by 14 snaps.. The Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition with the back cover removed. The battery is visible, but not removable, and the Micro-SIM slot can be seen at top left, just below the power button. Early reviews of the Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition noted that, despite what seems to be a fairly high-capacity battery (3,100mAh), battery life was under a day and the phone became warm during use. Based on the battery use statistics for our review sample, battery life appears to be around 27 hours (for light use). After extended periods of use, the back of the phone did become noticeably warm. The BQ E.4.5 Ubuntu Edition also initially suffered from a short battery life, but this was fixed by an operating system update shortly after launch.. Screen capture of battery performance on the Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition. A thin highlight of polished silver (or gold) around the frame sets off the sheet of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is bonded to the front to protect the display and form the OGS ('One-Glass Solution'). The bezel width on either side of the screen is only 2.6mm, resulting in a screen-to-front-panel ratio of 79 percent on the MX4, which apparently is near the limit for smartphones. An 11mm border above the display features a central slot for the earpiece/loudspeaker; to the right of the speaker is the ambient light sensor, and 16mm to the right of that is the front camera lens. The combined touch button and status light occupies centre of the 11mm border below the display.. On the back of the MX4, a 14mm disc of coated Gorilla Glass 3 protects the rear camera lens and its black surround. This design detail may be intended to make the lens, which is only about 2mm across, look bigger than it is. This 'lens' protrudes a little beyond the back of the phone, making it vulnerable to picking up dirt and scratches when the MX4 is laid on its back. Below the lens is a two-colour LED flash.. Once charged, the phone can be booted by a brief pressure on the on/off button on the right-hand side of the top edge. On the initial boot nothing appears to happen for a few seconds, and then the power-up splash screen appears, followed by a sequence of one-time setup screens -- Language, Lock security (swipe, none, passcode or passphrase), Wi-Fi, Location and Improving experience. There is then a short on-screen tutorial about Ubuntu gestures which seems impossible to skip.. With an activated Micro-SIM and a network connection, system updates can immediately be downloaded and installed by choosing System Settings from the launcher and then selecting Updates. However, in order to receive app updates users are prompted to log in with their Ubuntu ID. If you don't yet have an Ubuntu ID, you'll need to create one.. In addition to the power and volume buttons and the on-screen touch controls, the MX4 has a touch-operated button in the centre of the lower display surround. This is delimited by a circle which can be illuminated by a white LED status indicator. With the phone unlocked, touching this button displays whichever. scope is selected as first in order.. The MX4's NEGA 418ppi display shows bold saturated colours with great clarity and definition. This benefits the operating system graphics, which look clean and colourful, but colour looks a little oversaturated on stills and video.. Sony IMX 220 20.7-megapixel rear camera sensor that, in conjunction with the four-channel 1.5Gbps ISP (Image Signal Processor), apparently has the ability to shoot 4K video at 30fps. Under Ubuntu, however, video is limited to 1080p. There is a double colour temperature flash (5,500K and 2,200K) for warmer, more natural-looking, still portraits. The camera lens is a five-element f2.2 unit, 2.8mm in diameter with a 4.8mm focal length.. A Fine quality shot from the MX4's 20.7-megapixel rear camera. As on the BQ phone, the Ubuntu camera app offers three image settings (Basic, Normal and Fine), although these affect compression rather than resolution, with the Fine setting resulting in the least image compression. There is also an HDR (High Dynamic Range) on/off setting. The app settings are common to both cameras; the front camera has a four-element f2.0 lens and a 2-megapixel Sony IMX 208 sensor.. The experience of Ubuntu for Phones is a little different between the BQ Aquaris 4.5 and the Meizu MX4, each exhibiting different minor glitches. For example, the Meizu phone seems unable to automatically reacquire the default wi-fi connection after having moved out of range or having been turned off, which is not a problem with the BQ device.. BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition review: A promising start. The Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition offers a number of high-end hardware features at relatively low cost, but Ubuntu for Phones seems unable, yet, to take full advantage of the hardware. Compared to the BQ Aquaris E4.5, you might think that the Meizu MX4's extra processing power would make it noticeably more responsive. While some apps do load faster on the MX4, the difference between the two phones is not that great in this respect.. If you particularly want an Ubuntu-powered smartphone you might choose to buy the Meizu MX4 for its styling, high-resolution 5.36-inch display and 20.7-megapixel rear camera. However, you might also want to look at BQ's new €199.90. Aquaris E5 HD Ubuntu Edition , which has a 5-inch screen, a 13-megapixel rear camera and 16GB of storage (plus a Micro-SD card slot)..

I used this crazy alternative 'Ubuntu' phone for a month and ended up liking it more than Android. released in September 2014 running Googleâs Android operating. Compared to top-end Android handsets, like. the Samsung Galaxy S6 , the Meizu MX4âs hardware isnât. But, when you consider its price,. the Meizu MX4 is reasonably well stocked. luminium alloy body and matte back. A displayâs ppi density is a general. indicator how sharp a display will be, anything above 400 is. twice as expensive the iPhone 6 comes with a with a 4.7in. 1334x750, 326 ppi Retina HD display.. Mediatek-made 2.2GHz processor and 20.7 megapixel (MP) rear. camera sensor, which again, on paper make the Meziu MX4 great. WHAT? â is a growing trend in the world of smartphones that. work to improve handset performance and improve their. with a similar Sony Exmor RS sensor to those seen in. the Japanese firmâs top end line of Xperia smartphones. improve the Meizu MX4âs picture quality by removing background. It only comes with a piddly. Sadly, it also doesnât feature a microSD card,. meaning users wonât be able to add more space.. flagship Ubuntu phone is an interesting beast. If you walked into any bar in Europe or the US and asked if. had heard of the "Ubuntu" phone, you would count the. And almost certainly none of them would own Â. Ubuntu phone, because everyone uses iPhone or Android.. Ubuntu is an open-source operating system that only really has a. name in IT and developer communities. category of software that is free for anyone to use and/or. powers data centres and household-name operating systems like. So the chances are you have actually used. something powered by Ubuntu at some point in your life already,. However, Ubuntu is not going to sit in the backroom forever. company that makes it, Canonical, has been working on a mobile. version of Ubuntu capable of taking on Googleâs Android. That work that has born fruit this year with the arrival. of the firmâs flagship Meizu MX4. Now, Iâm sure most of you reading this article are asking âwhy. should I care about Ubuntu phone?â. Canonical is actually one of the most advanced. and forward-looking companies when it comes to creating the Holy. Grail of technologies, a âubiquitous operating system.â. platform where all devices, regardless of whether theyâre a. phone, tablet, smartwatch, smart thermostat or even smart traffic. light, run using the same back-end technology and are able to. Youâll hear tech folks refer to this idea. the Internet of Things (IoT) or machine. If realised, this dream would make it so that things like our. smartphones could not only detect but also predict and. needs without us having to lift a finger.. The Ubuntu phone is a massive part of Canonicalâs plan to make. It aims to completely rethink the way we interact. with our smartphones and our smartphones interact with us.. After a solid month using it, let me tell you, while there are. some growing pains, Ubuntuâs phone offering is a startling piece. of technology that left me wishing our machine carers â and. potential overlords â would arrive sooner.. The Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition is currently only being sold in. Europe as a promotional competition model. requires people interested in buying the phone, which carries a. â¬300 price tag, to visit a special page on Meizu's website. and win an "invite to purchase.". phones go the Meizu MX4 is pretty good for a mid-range. I've heard both Apple and Google claim their operating system has. reinvented the wheel when talking about their yearly iOS or. But each time what they've actually done is fairly minor and adds. up to moving a widget, or adjusting the placement of a sub menu,. while keeping the same core window-based, click-on-app/open-app. This isn't the case with Ubuntu.. When I first picked it up, theÂ. the most unique and alien mobile operating system I'd. ever experienced (and this is coming from someone who's sampled. everything from BlackBerry 10 to Mozilla's FireFox OS and. For starters, the Ubuntu OS has a completely reworked user. interface that replaces the traditional home screen with a new. The scope system does away with the traditional mobile interface. where applications are stored and accessed from a central series. with a âtailored series of individual. home screensâ that intelligently collect and push information. from a variety of apps in a similar way to Googleâs Now service.. (Google Now is a service on Android that pushes information it. thinks will be of interest to its user.). The scopes organise the data in custom home screens for specific. For example, if you go to the âNearbyâ scope, the phone will pull. information from apps like Maps, Yelp, Timeout and Facebook to. pull in items of interest, like local public transport links and. If you go to "music" it will pull up the songs you regularly. listen to, while recommending similar artists you may want to. you access information from all the. applications installed on the phone without having to open them. As an added bonus it also removes the need to jump. from application to application when opening and responding to. Ubuntu Application Launcher has shortcuts to the phone's core. Adding to Ubuntuâs otherworldly, unique feel, the OS is also. significantly more touch- and gesture-focused than iOS and. We found nearly all the key features and menus on. Meizu MX4 are accessed using gesture controls, not. For example, a short scroll from the left brings out the Ubuntu. Unity Application launcher - which is a customizable shortcut. menu to specific core-applications, like the phone dialler, maps,. A short scroll from the right brings out the last open. application, while a longer scroll right brings up a new window. showing all the open applications on the phone.. Unless you're one of the few people currently using BlackBerry. 10, the gesture-focused controls and scopes system will feel very. weird, even if you are fairly technical.. For the first two weeks I was slightly out of sorts using Ubuntu. phone and would regularly find myself by default trying to go to. However midway through my second week I had an odd moment where. everything clicked and I began adjusting to Ubuntu's way of doing. The moment occurred one evening when I managed to turn up to. meeting in an area of London I wasn't too familiar with. with a couple of hours to kill, I found myself by default. checking the Nearby scope rather than reaching for the specific. In the scope I got a useful weather update alerting me. incoming rain and a series of recommendationsÂ. decent coffee shops and local landmarks â which included a pretty. awesome comic shop â I could visit. The experience is a great example of why, when it works, the. Ubuntu user interface is so good.Â. actually found myself having mixed feelings about going back to. performance and hardware, but it felt slightly clunky to use. after two-plus weeks with the Meizu MX4 Ubuntu edition.. Despite being a young operating system I was also impressed with. the number of applications Canonical has managed to get into its. regular mobile providers, including Google, Apple, Yahoo, Mozilla. Ubuntu has also gone to lengths to make sure its OS works with. all the main software providers, and this has paid off. onto an unknown platform wasn't as scary as it could have been.. All this makes it sound like Ubuntu is great, and for the most. However, during my four weeks with the device I. noticed a few serious bugs that damage its overall consumer. generally fine, there were instances when it would noticeably. On occasion, even when doing basic things like. switching between scopes and applications, the Meizu MX4 would. While this isnât too serious, and being fair I never once had an. application unexpectedly crash or quit on me, it did become an. Then there was the larger battery issue. MX4âs 3,100 Milliamp Hour (mAh) battery should offer a fairly. (mAh is a metric designed to gauge a batteryâs. The bigger the number the more charge a. As battery sizes go 3,100mAh is. pretty big for a phone the Meizu MX4's size. Galaxy S6 has a 2550 mAh battery and the iPhone 6 has. life is oddly poor on the Meizu MX4 Ubuntu. Despite having a decent-sized power pack, for some reason the. Ubuntu OS put a much heavier drain on the battery than I expected. and in general the phone struggled to survive a full day with. Moderate use entailed listening to music on. the way to and from work, taking and making a few calls, checking. maps a couple of times, sporadically browsing the web and. regularly checking social media and email.. I think this is something to do with the way the Ubuntu OS. handles multitasking, as not only did the phone heat up to an. uncomfortable level when running multiple apps, it also outright. leaked its charge and would continue to rapidly lose power, even. Finally, there's my biggest criticism â Ubuntu phone is not smart. While the app selection is impressive for a. prototype, in its infancy Ubuntu phone doesn't have enough. feeding into it, as key services are missing.. For example big-name shopping and grocery services, like Amazon. commonly used apps, such as SpotifyÂ. officially supported â though their web apps do work. annoying as it keeps key bits of data that could further improve. Ubuntu's ability to intelligently predict my needs from appearing. that are there do work really well.. it has potential, Ubuntu Phone still needs some work to be ready. Now down to the real question, should you consider buying an. Ubuntu phone? For a general, non-techie person used to iOS or. Android my answer, for now, would be, probably not.. While the OS oozes tech appeal and gets so much right at the. backend, bugs in its software jar the user experience just enough. Additionally, despite having a decent offering for a. new OS, Ubuntu phone is still behind Apple and Google when it. (That is to be expected for such a new. Given everything Canonical has gotten right, coupled with the. oddly intuitive user interface, I canât but find the Meizu MX4. Ubuntu edition interesting, and I want to see Ubuntu phone. continue to grow and get smarter.Â. As a result, while I wouldnât recommend general consumers buy the. phone, Iâd definitely urge tech savvy buyers or developers. interested in trying something new, to check out the Ubuntu Meizu. MX4 and help further improve the upstart operating systemâs. EXCLUSIVE FREE SLIDE DECK: The Next Smartphone by the BI Intelligence Research Team. Get the Slide Deck Now ».

Для меня это показатель, потому что обычно желание поменять появляется в течение полугода. Очень удобная оболочка, бешеное быстродействие, отличная сборка. Телефон ничем не уступает аналогам в 2 раза дороже, а многие даже превосходит. Cons: Иногда батареи не хватает даже на день при активном использовании, но это беда всех аппаратов со схожими характеристики.. Is this helpful? Yes ( 0 ) No ( 0 ).

Pros: La verdad es que es un móvil increible, el diseño es espectacular de los mejores del mercado, la pantalla de las mejores que he podido ver, pero los marcos tan delgados es de lo mejor del móvil. La cámara también es digna de mención, lo malo es que no posee estabilizador de imagen para las fotos nocturnas. Pero en general muy buenas fotografías. Otro punto a favor son las continuas actualizaciones por parte de Meizu Cons: La única pega que le puedo poner es que de primeras tienes que acostumbrarte a Flyme, y la falta de expansión de tarjetas microsd. Is this helpful? Yes ( 0 ) No ( 0 ). Pros: Fantastic phone! The phone has a large screen but this doesn't feel too big when you hold it. I think this is due to the fact that it's light and thin. Battery life is very good compared to my older phone (HTC Desire HD) and lasts well over a day. The highlight of the phone is the camera - great quality pictures and lot's of features including slow motion video recording which is a lot of fun! Easy to get apps from the Play Store and easy enough to personalise where all the apps appear on your homepage. Everyone has a Samsung, iPhone or HTC... be different! People are definitely impressed when they see it, I tell them it's the Chinese iPhone! Cons: When typing in messages and emails the phone won't use predictive text and won't highlight incorrect spellings. There might be an app to alter this though and also it's rare that you'll make many mistakes when typing as the key panel is large. Occasional unresponsiveness when looking at web pages (minor issue).. Is this helpful? Yes ( 0 ) No ( 0 ). Get GB Points! Be the FIRST to Write a Review!.

Meizu is a well-known Chinese manufacturer which usually delivers solid devices to the market. Meizu MX3 was a rather popular device and many people have been waiting for its successor, Meizu MX4. The device was announced on September 2nd 2014 and by the end of that month company has sold over 7 million of those devices which exceeded their expectations. Meizu MX4 is a well-specced, well-made device which carries a rather affordable price tag. The device comes sporting Meizu’s very own Flyme 4.0 OS which features a flat design and consumers seem to like it.. Meizu MX4 features a 5.36-inch 1080p (1920 x 1152) display along with 2GB of RAM and 16, 32 or 64GB of in-built storage. MediaTek’s MT6595 octa-core processor is powering on this device along with PowerVR Series 6 GPU. 20.7-megapixel shooter is located at the back of the device along with a dual LED, dual tone flash. On the front of the device, you can find a 5-megapixel snapper which should come in handy if you like to take a selfie here and there or you use the video call feature of your device. MX4 comes with Android 4.4.4 KitKat pre-installed with Meizu’s Flyme 4.0 OS on top of it. The device measures 144 x 75.2 x 8.9mm and weighs 147 grams.. People are skeptical when it comes to Chinese brands, which is normal considering majority of copycat devices come from that country and they’re basically all about budget products. Meizu MX4 is definitely not like that, this device is solid either way you look at it. You get a well-built, well-specced device for a really affordable price basically wherever you live. Flyme has come a long way and it is a really solid OS, so no worries there. It all depends on whether you’re willing to get a device from a manufacturer you don’t know all that well or all you all about well-known brands. Meizu MX4 is truly a great offering, Meizu did a great job when they were making this thing..

The MX4, with its brilliant display and alluring design is one of the most beautiful devices Meizu has made yet, but is marred by an inconsistent experience.. The Meizu MX4 may have the looks to stand toe-to-toe with the flagships -- as long as you like its squarish shape -- but its buggy software and poor performance mean you should steer clear for now..

It’s a little like the first few versions of Android. Limited app support, less than perfect UI, and not very refined, but crucially, full of promise. The quirkiness makes it hard to recommend to anyone... There’s one word that sums up the Ubuntu Mobile-powered Meizu MX4 — quirky. It’s a little like the first few versions of Android. Limited app support, less than perfect UI, and not very refined, but crucially, full of promise. The quirkiness makes it hard to recommend to anyone considering defecting from Android or iOS, or someone who wants to use the phone every day. Without some key apps, it may end up being frustrating, or worse, not realistically useable each day. I certainly found it that way, and couldn’t carry it as my sole device purely because it didn’t have the app support I needed to get stuff done.. Great screen, superb fluidity, a solid user interface and impressive multimedia credentials. In sum, the Meizu MX4 is pleasantly surprising, especially after the sluggish MX3. The device doesn't have any major flaws and even manages to challenge its far more costly high-end competitors across the board.

The device doesn't have any major flaws and even manages to challenge its far more costly high-end competitors across the board. Granted, it's not completely free from fault—the lack of memory card and removable battery could be a point of contention (as with the Nexus and iPhones)—but it redeems itself with a great screen, superb fluidity, a solid user interface and impressive multimedia credentials.. Attractive, premium design without breaking the bank. With the MX4, it seems like a tantalizing deal. A beautifully crafted device with a huge 1080p display, all for under $450? That sounds like a no-brainer. Unfortunately, the OS is filled with bugs, the battery life is a huge let down, and the camera struggles to take acceptable photos in anything... With the MX4, it seems like a tantalizing deal. A beautifully crafted device with a huge 1080p display, all for under $450? That sounds like a no-brainer. Unfortunately, the OS is filled with bugs, the battery life is a huge let down, and the camera struggles to take acceptable photos in anything but ideal lighting conditions. If you can get past those main compromises, though, you’ll have a phone with great screen, super powerful processor and awesome build quality. For around $400, you could do much worse than the MX4.. Beautiful hardware is marred by buggy software. The Meizu MX4 may look like it has what it takes to be a great phone, or at least an interesting one, but it's plagued by a bug-ridden operating system that fails to deliver a positive experience. I would recommend staying away from it, until Meizu manages to get the OS in order..

A worthy flagship device that can be had for the price of a much inferior upper-mid range phone from a brand like Sony, LG, or Samsung. That said, do keep in mind that the phone ships from Hong Kong, and all warranty-related repairs will have to be carried out there as well. So it follows that the MX4 has to deliver, and deliver in full. Well, to a very large extent, it does. The design isn't anything jaw-dropping, but it's still fairly attractive and the phone is very sturdy and comfortable to use for its screen size. The display is pretty great, too, and performance is also top notch. The 20.7-megapixel Sony camera at the back is no joke, either. Last, but not least, the MX4's 3100 mAh battery ensures day and a half of juice even with hard usage. On the down side, the sample unit we received had Meizu's Chinese app and theme stores integrated into its interface and a few essential apps, which is a bit of a let-down. After all, we don't all know Chinese. If you're willing to turn a blind eye to that little nuisance, however, then the Meizu MX4 is a great flagship for those of you on a smaller budget..

Join Date: Joined: Feb 2012. Ive been intrested in this phone for quite some time now and thinking of buying it.... I currently own a coolpad f1 and happy with it. The thing is a miss custom roms and modding from the xda community..... I see that the mx3 doesn't have any custom roms at all, same goes with the mx4?. Join Date: Joined: Nov 2014. It would be perfect if they learn from OPO and has a custom rom other than their official rom. I read news and there is rumor about ubuntu touch team up with them, but seem like this will not really happen.. Phone is excellent, we only need a quality rom on it.

It could be "top" with its MT6595... 2) Clear all apps in background (hold home and swipe them away) and then run droidfish. 3) Press the menu button, invoke "Settings", choose "Threads" and select "Automatic", and then press back button to get back to chess board. 4) There is button with label "M" below chess board. Press it and choose "Analysis Mode". Keep it running for about 1 minute. 5) After 1 minute passed, read and record the "nps:" number at bottom of the screen. This is the measurement I'm interested in. This value is a number of positions searched per second (in thousands). 6) IMPORTANT: To force program to STOP thinking, press "M" button again, choose "Two players" so that analysis will stop. Post the results here with rom information (optional). Stock rom is preferable but other roms are welcomed.
