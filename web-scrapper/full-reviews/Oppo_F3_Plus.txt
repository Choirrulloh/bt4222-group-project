OPPO F3 Plus: A New Benchmark in the Top-End Range?. Philippines Market Forecast for OPPO F3 Plus:. OPPO F3 Plus is one more addition to the Selfie Expert series. Other than the Dual-Camera setup up front, it has all the specs to take it to the top-end range. Know more about what makes this device one of the best ones around.. OPPO F3 Plus looks every bit of the price tag it carries. It has a bit of everything that a buyer might expect from a high-end smartphone. The all-metal body comes in either pink or gold. Bordering on the sides and the single capacitive touch button up front add the dual-tone hue. Ultra-slim 1.78 mm bezels lead to deliciously curved edges flowing onto a matte, smooth rear cover.. Grip is exquisitely excellent and at 185 grams, the weight is perfectly balanced for a luxurious use and grip. With dimensions of 163.6 x 80.8 x 7.4 mm (6.44 x 3.18 x 0.29 inches), this is an engineering marvel considering what it is capable of inside out.. Dual Front Cam setup is something which few other smartphones even high-end ones can add to their sheets. Simply, OPPO F3 Plus has a 16 MP and another 8 MP shooter on it. The 16 MP camera has a f/2.0 aperture and 1/3 inch sensor size for optimum image details and clarity. The 8 MP aids it with a 120-degree wide angle view capabilities.. Together, this hardware can capture vibrant images with amazing clarity at par and even above what other front camera setups can capture. The 8 MP provides added subject capture while the 16 MP takes the details. OPPO F3 Plus goes even further with its Selfie Expert USP; it adds Beautify 4.0 to take selfies to the next level. Multiple auto-enhancement functions along with just as many custom options and filters make sure that this device lives up to its expectations.. OPPO F3 Plus has a 16 MP rear camera with a sharp f/1.7 aperture and next-gen PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus) tech to take faster images in darker settings with stunning reality. Added OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) functions and a 1/2.8 inch sensor size allow this camera to take 2K quality images and videos. And this is rated as one of the best rear cameras that OPPO has manufactured till date.. The Qualcomm MSM8976 Pro Snapdragon 653 is a not-so-common processor setup. It has an Octa-core setup merging a Quad-Core Cortex-A72 with another Quad-Core Cortex-A53 along with an integrated Adreno 510 GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). This setup allows the OPPO F3 Plus to achieve core-speeds nearing 1.95 GHz.. This 6-inch display under a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 has a screen resolution of 1920x1080 pixels with a pixel density of 367 PPI (Pixels Per Inch). Rated highly, image depth and texture sharpness is as expected from a high-end device. And it looks exceptionally well up front sharing a huge 75%+ size ratio with the body.. OPPO F3 Plus runs on an Android 6.0 Marshmallow. There are chances that OPPO will add an Android 7.0 Nougat upgrade later on. But that will need an upgraded version ColorOS 3.0 UI too. Adding more fun along with functions, this is their signature UI software which works over the stock Android.. OPPO F3 Plus comes with a 4 GB RAM paired with 64 GB internal storage. The storage can be extended to a maximum of 256 GB via microSD cards.. Power comes from a 4000 mAh battery with added VOOC fast charging features.. Philippines are one of the most important mobile device markets in the world. OPPO F3 Plus will release around April, 2017 with online sales to kick off earlier. This device has generated a strong hype and it does have more in it than flashy cameras, enough to garner strong sales.. User Review : 3 Reviews. Wla ng masabi basta maganda sya.

Oppo F3 Plus Review: A bigger, better successor to the F1 Plus. Oppo took the selfie-smartphone craze up a notch last year when the company introduced its F1 Plus smartphone. It packed in average specifications that one would find in a budget smartphone, at a not-so budget price tag. Its saving grace was its construction, build quality, design and that front facing camera, which set new standards for the sub Rs 30,000 smartphone segment.. While Oppo retained the good stuff from the F1 Plus in its successor, the F3 Plus, it also managed to bring in some improvements, including a bigger battery, a powerful processor and let's not forget the highlight, which is a dual-camera on the front. The new Oppo F3 Plus has also grown larger and heavier thanks to the bigger display and a larger battery, and the price has grown with it. But the competition too has learnt for the success of the F1 Plus, and capable rivals have been. on sale for a couple of months now. So how does it compare with what you get on the Samsung C9 Pro , the Xiaomi Mi Max Prime , the Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra , the OnePlus 3T and the Vivo V5 Plus ? Let's find out.. I loved the design of the Oppo F1 Plus, it was not too large and not too small but just right with a 5.5-inch display. With the F3 Plus, Oppo takes things up a notch and seems to be of the opinion that its customers need a bigger display. So this time around, we get a massive 6-inch display, which makes the smartphone a lot bigger to hold and heavier as well.. At 185 g the phone did not feel any lighter or heavier than its competition. But Oppo did manage to make the design quite slim, which makes it more hand-friendly in comparison to the mammoth Xiaomi Mi Max. You still cannot use the phablet with one hand, but it does not feel as big as I expected it to be.. Xiaomi Mi Max, Oppo F3 Plus, Apple iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s. Xiaomi Mi Max, Oppo F3 Plus, Apple iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s. It does not peep out my jeans pocket as much as I expected it to either, meaning that its size does not get in the way of your everyday life which is commendable for a smartphone with a 6-inch display.. The design is not exactly unique or new, with rounded corners and the typical Oppo design language that we have seen since the F1 Plus. In fact from the front it could get hard to tell when viewed from a distance.. The Oppo F3 Plus is quite slim for a smartphone of this size and category. In fact, it is the slimmest phablet I have used so far.. However, it is the back where things get exciting. F1 Plus owners may find that it looks identical to their smartphones, but there is a nice touch here. It features a “six string antenna” that includes 3 at the top and three toward the bottom.. And it almost appears to be a design statement like on the Samsung C9 Pro. So it’s not the first to do this. The antenna bands are supposed to enhance network connectivity and not look ugly in the process and so far, I'm impressed. I initially thought that these fine lines were grooves. Little did I know these were some cool-looking antenna bands.. I like how Oppo has stuck with its philosophy of retaining its quick fingerprint scanner on the front. Unlike the Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra and the Xiaomi Mi Max, this one's easy to reach and you can unlock the phone in milliseconds.. The Oppo F3 Plus builds on the Oppo F1 plus and offers a noticeable improvement in all areas. The display is still stuck at FHD (1920 x 1080 pixels) but the screen size has grown to a massive 6-inches of real estate. Inside, buyers will get a Qualcomm MSM8976 Pro (Snapdragon 653) clocked at 1.95GHz and paired with an Adreno 510 GPU and 4GB RAM. Internal storage is 64GB but can be expanded using a microSD card slot which Oppo calls a Triple card slot but is basically no different from a hybrid SIM slot that allows for only two cards (SIM+SIM or SIM+micro SDCard) at a time.. Coming to the cameras a lot has changed in terms of the layout. You get a Sony IMX398 16MP camera with Dual PDAF mechanism with an f/1.7 aperture. On the front, Oppo has gone in for a 16MP camera and an 8MP 120 degrees wide angle unit. The technology however is quite different from what is available on the Vivo V5 plus, but similar to the system on the LG G5.. Communications options include, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth V4.1, dual nano SIM with 4G bands and support for VoLTE. The features a micro USB port at the bottom with OTG support.. All of the above is powered by a 4,000mAh battery that supports Oppo’s VOOC fast charging technology. A fingerprint reader sits on front and claims to unlock the device in 0.2 milliseconds.. The display on offer is similar to the great one I used last time on the F1 Plus. It is a JDI In Cell LCD 16 million colour touchscreen display that offers a 1920 x 1080 pixel array with a pixel density of 367 PPI. Last time around with the smaller screen size, we got 401PPI which was amazingly sharp. This time however things are not too bad either even with slightly lower pixel density.. The display features a 2.5D Gorilla Glass 5 screen on the front and comes with an oleophobic coating. But it is really prone to smudges, even though those grease marks can be wiped off easily.. In day to day usage the display fared really well. It was sharp, and even the finest font available could be read clearly and without any noticeable pixelation. The display is also bright enough to tackle a sunny afternoon (in direct sunlight) and dim enough to read books in a dark room. The colours displayed were slightly oversaturated to my eye. Viewing angles were spot on, however. This made the smartphone a brilliant media player. and the accompanying battery proved really useful while watching movies or clicking photos. There’s no colour shifting like the last time around either, which was due to the AMOLED unit. So it’s really hard to complain about anything out here.. Oppo has included Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with ColourOS 3.0.01. There’s nothing new in here that’s not there on the F1 Plus, so indeed there is little to be excited about. At the same time, Oppo has maintained the smoothness of the OS and it doesn't feel heavy or seem to bog down the hardware in any way. Apps opened and closed instantly, multitasking was a breeze. And more importantly, I liked how everything felt consistent across the OS, with its well-designed sub menus that kind of mimicked Apple’s iOS. So it is basically an app drawer-less version of Android with an iOS like skinning. But Oppo has done a good job by optimising it well to the display and the processor.. Customisation is supported as well, with Lockscreen magazine and themes gallery. And yes, I could even change the font. The software also has a security app which allows for boosting performance by clearing up app cache and also a virus scanner supported by Avast, which is pretty handy.. It seems like the complete and perfect software package until you factor in that this is March 2017 and the Android smartphone’s software version is still stuck at 6.0 Marshmallow. Nougat here would have been a great way for Oppo to stand out from the crowd, so let’s hope that Oppo at least delivers on the update front. What I did not like was that there was literally no battery statistics available. After some deep digging I managed to find a toggle to at least show how much battery life was left in percentage instead of the standard battery bar logo. I missed this feature on the F1 Plus and it seems like Oppo hasn’t looked into the matter yet.. ColorOS seemed well optimised with the hardware back in the F1 Plus. This time around, things have only got better. UI and software performance was flawless and the same can be said about gaming thanks to the Snapdragon 653 chipset inside.. Games like Real Racing 3 , Dead Trigger 2 and. Asphalt Xtreme worked well on the highest settings and without dropping or skipping any frames. This smartphone indeed makes for a great gaming smartphone as well and that 4000mAh battery ensures that you can keep playing for quite a while before the juice runs out.. But as with every performance oriented smartphone, the device gets a bit warm. After half an hour or RR3 which is pretty graphic intensive, the phone became warm but not too hot or hot enough for me to close the app. The 4,000mAh battery left me gaming longer without the need to worry about making it through the day.. Audio was pretty loud through the earpiece and I often found myself turning down the volume by a few notches to keep my ears intact. Output through the headphones while listening to music was a great experience thanks to Dirac and the built-in equaliser was an added bonus too. Audio output through the speakers was both loud and clear. Oppo has done a fantastic job at keeping audio clear even when you max out the volume. The primary camera on the Oppo F3 Plus is a 16MP Sony IMX398 sensor. It’s a good one and with an f/1.7 aperture delivers good pictures in daylight with noise being under control.. The sharpness levels were spot on, but the details in the images don’t hold up when zooming into an image beyond 40 percent. The textures look a bit flat even in broad daylight, but the colours remain well saturated. My best guess is that the F3 Plus’s noise removal works overtime and kills the details. The camera has a tendency to overexpose, and it does so very frequently. Even HDR images can’t save the day at times.. There’s no OIS, and this becomes a major problem after the sun sets. Images shot have almost no detail, look flat and showcase lots of luminance noise. In short this is not a good smartphone for low light shooting in Auto mode.. Switching to the front-facing camera, I expected better. But frankly speaking, that was not exactly what I got. Maybe I expected a bit too much after the impressive F1 Plus, but the results of the selfies were not that exciting.. The front facing dual camera setup uses a 16MP unit through a standard lens while an 8MP unit is used with a 120 degree wide-angle lens. There is a toggle in the camera interface to switch between the two just like on the LG G6, only in this case it’s on the front of the device instead of the back.. The cameras produced good images in daylight with the usual over exposure problem. The metering system seemed to not work right as I often found myself in the dark when there was a light source behind me. This was not the case with the F1 Plus.. Move to low light and the cameras keep the noise in control but kill the details along with it. The results are not that impressive and the images can get blurry with little movement as the focussing system struggles to lock on quickly, which is not the case with the primary camera.. The lack of OIS was clearly felt and would have improved the situation by a large margin.. Indeed, the Vivo V5 Plus does a better job at selfies and captures a lot more detail along with better image processing.. Video recording was pretty good and delivered great 4K clips and Full HD video.. The battery inside the Oppo F3 Plus has grown along with the bigger display. And Oppo indeed seems to have squeezed the 4,000mah battery in tight considering how slim the device is for a phablet. Using our standard PCMark Work battery life test, we got a about 8 and half hours of continuous screen usage until the test halted at the usual 20 percent mark.. While it appears to drain fast when fully charged. That drop in battery life stops dropping quickly after the 90 percent. Post that, it goes on and on like the Duracell bunny. I managed to get over 2 hours of calling with just 5 percent of battery life. Which is pretty impressive as to how much you can squeeze out of this device. Turn the Low power Mode on and you can easily get at least 3-4 hours or even more.. And that is not the best part. Oppo’s VOOC fast charging means that you can get 2 hours of talk time with just a 5 minute charge. The phone speeds up while charging from 0-70 and then slows down a bit as it nears the 100 percent mark in a little over an hour which is good for a 4,000mAh battery.. With my experience of the Oppo F1 Plus in mind, I really wanted to like the Oppo F3 Plus, despite its larger than usual size. The design was spot on, the hardware is powerful and the battery life is great. But its imaging chops are a let down when you have used the F1 Plus and see how much more. it delivered last year, something that is clear from its success in sales for Oppo as well.. Last year’s all-rounder has turned out to be a brute with less finesse. Oppo does get plenty right and at a Rs 30,990 asking price, it sounds like a good deal. But with the OnePlus 3T around in the same price range, it does not come close to the 3T’s raw performance numbers and also in the camera department.. Looking for selfies? The Vivo V5 Plus is a better deal and even better than the OnePlus when it comes to selfies, even with its Snapdragon 625 inside. If you have a lower budget, you could consider the Xiaomi Mi Max. Prime, which also has a large display but is priced almost Rs 10,000 lower. better construction quality and slightly better camera performance than the Mi Max Prime though, hence the price premium.. The Oppo F3 Plus features a 6.0-inch FHD IPS display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and is powered by a 1.95GHz octa core processor and has 4GB of RAM. It comes with 64GB of inbuilt storage, expandable upto 256GB and has a 16.0-megapixel rear camera and 16.0 + 8.0-megapixel front camera. It comes with Color 3.0, based on Android 6.0 OS and support a 4000mAh battery capacity with 3G & 4G.. Color 3.0, based on Android 6.0. 80.8 x 7.35 x 163.63 mm.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. 3840x2160 (4K) (30 fps), 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (30 fps). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 1950 MHz, ARM Cortex-A72 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

The dimensions of the device are important to note: 163.6 x 80.8 x 7.4 mm, as well as the large diagonal of 6 inches..

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. JC Torres - Apr 1, 2017. Responsive and good quality cameras Adequate performance for everyday use Decent battery life, fast charging. Not much differentiation from previous models (except selifes). These days, if your smartphone doesn’t have defining special feature or selling point, it’s going to be forgotten amidst a sea of smartphones whose designs and specs are starting to all look alike. And it isn’t enough anymore to have a wallet-friendly price only. Some boast screens with almost no bezels. The OPPO F3 Plus, which was just announced last week, sort of mixes all those, but with a different twist. Yes, it has dual cameras, but it puts those on the front, making sure you get the perfect selfie, whether by yourself or with others. But how does that promise measure up in practice? We take a long hard look to find out.. Make no mistake, the OPPO F3 Plus isn’t a high-end smartphone. That is, if you only judge by the specs. Of course, very few OEMs market their top of the line devices as “mid-range”, unless they are aiming squarely for that market and price tier. Most of the time, they will sugarcoat their words to make device sound more premium, and sometimes it does work.. Truth be told, the boundaries between tiers are blurring again. While base performance still largely depends on what hardware you have, the right mix of components and software optimizations might surprise you in real-world usage. Case in point is this OPPO F3 Plus. It does use Qualcomm’s mid-range chip, the Snapdragon 653. But it does have 4 GB of RAM, which, as LG and Samsung have demonstrated, is still the high-end standard. Coupled with the fact that it only pushes pixels inside a 6-inch 1920×1080 rectangle, then you can pretty much presume the CPU and GPU aren’t taxed unnecessarily. Here’s a rundown of those juicy specs:. • Operating System: Android 6.0 Marshmallow, ColorOS 3.0. • CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 653, 1.95 GHz octa-core. • Storage: 64 GB, expandable up to 256 GB. • Display: 6.0 inches, 1920×1080 367 ppi. • Main Camera: 16 megapixel, 1.28-inch, f/1.7, Dual PDAF. • Secondary Camera: 16 megapixel + 8 megapixel 120-degree wide angle. • Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.1, micro USB. • Battery: 4,000 mAh, VOOC Flash Charge. • Dimensions: 163.63 x 80.8 x 7.35 mm. It’s rather disappointing to see Android 6.0 in a 2017 flagship model, at a time when 2016 devices are getting upgraded to Nougat and new phones are coming with Nougat right off the bat. And while the 4,000 mAh battery does feature OPPO’s VOOC Flash Charge tech, it doesn’t bear the “Super” VOOC that OPPO revealed at MWC last year. Strangely enough, none of its phones do.. At first glance, especially from the front, the OPPO F3 Plus will look familiar. And by “familiar” we mean not only does it look like its immediate predecessor, the OPPO F1 line, but also like a fruit-named company’s recent smartphones. You have a very white facade, with very large bezels at the top and bottom. The side edges have the usual 2.5D “Arc” glass curve to avoid sharp corners cutting into your palm. That, however, is where most of the similarities stop.. For the sides, OPPO has gone with the classic flat, chamfered edges of old. The difference is very subtle and you probably won’t notice it unless you look really closely. And the way that light plays on the surface of those edges make them look more curved than they really are. That said, the back is still a bit curved, especially around the edges, just like an iPhone. But even here, OPPO is throwing in some subtle changes to differentiate its smartphone.. Instead of the much derided iPhone antenna lines, the OPPO F3 Plus has six extremely thin lines, three at the top and three at the bottom. Each line in that “six-string” design measures only 0.3 mm thick. While the change is mostly aesthetic, it is also symbolic, hinting at the smartphone’s support for six frequency ranges.. The F3 Plus is an all-metal affair, which, for some, might be a welcome break from all the glass rears and fingerprint smudges we’re seeing this year. Glass is pretty and, depending on the type, is more scratch proof, but it also feels more flimsy and fragile. In contrast, this OPPO giant feels solid, almost hefty, offering confidence while not exactly sacrificing premium looks. Glass might be the new black this year, but metal isn’t going anywhere.. To some extent, you could almost consider the F3 Plus’ design as a throwback to older, but also more proven, styles. It has a familiar face with enough subtle differences to urge you to take a second look. And, yes, the throwback also means there’s still a 3.5 mm headphone jack there, for better or for worse. And some will insist, it’s for the better.. Just because the OPPO F3 Plus has mid-range specs doesn’t mean it is a slouch. Sure, it’s not going to win any race, depending on which benchmark you ask, but, in the final analysis, its real-world performance is what matters most to consumers. And in that regard, the F3 Plus doesn’t disappoint.. Operations with the OPPO F3 Plus were as smooth as butter. Multi-tasking has been made easy by the 4 GB of RAM you’d mostly see only in higher tier smartphones. The Snapdragon 653, by the way, is the MSM8976 “Pro”, which is Qualcomm’s best mid-range chip so far. But for completion’s sake, here are some benchmark figures as well. Note that the OPPO F3 Plus is able to rub shoulders with last year’s top-tier, and more expensive, models.. A smartphone isn’t just made up of processors and memory, however. In fact, to the user, it is mostly made up of a screen. It’s no AMOLED, but F3 Plus’ display is as bright and vibrant as any LCD panel can be. In all honesty, there isn’t much to be said about OPPO’s screens, which hasn’t exactly undergone massive changes in the past two years or so. It’s probably playing it safe by not changing a winning formula, but a screen size revolution is coming and OPPO might be caught unprepared.. The massive 4,000 mAh battery is, well massive. It’s definitely more than your average flagship smartphone, though it is on par with the OPPO F3 Plus’ equally massive size. Battery life isn’t exactly going to be a problem, especially considering the specs. With continued active use that included a mix of gaming, browsing, and Netflix binging, we got an average of 9 hours. Of course, you will experience longer hours with more relenting and varied usage. The bottleneck for large batteries is usually the charging times, so thankfully OPPO included is VOOC Flash Charge tech. It would have been great, however, if it finally put its Super VOOC in an actual commercial device.. At the end of the day, the OPPO F3 Plus will be judged by its camera, particularly the two on the front. After all, it calls itself a Selfie Expert, and this time it has two of them. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen this setup on the face of smartphone, mind. The LG V10 had one, before LG decided to trade its place with the main camera on the V20. More recently, the Vivo V5 Plus also touts a tag team, but with a very different implementation.. As it stands, there are currently two ways to implement dual cameras. One uses one sensor for recording more light data, usually depth and contrast, ala the Huawei P9 and P10. The other method uses the second camera for wide-angle shots, ala the LG G5 and G6. The OPPO F3 Plus uses the latter convention for its dual selfie cameras.. The “main” front camera has a 16 megapixel 1/3-inch sensor with an f/2.0 aperture for taking in your regular selfie or two-fie. The other camera has a lower 8 megapixel count but a wider 120-degree angle lens which is better for packing in a larger crowd. Unsure which one to use for a given occasion? Let the F3 Plus decide for you. When it detects more than three faces in a shot, it will recommend switching to the wide-angle camera to make sure no one gets left out and no feelings get hurt.. The main rear camera isn’t as exciting but is by no means disappointing either. OPPO says it worked closely with Sony to develop an exclusive IMX398 sensor for it. That’s a 1.28-inch 16 megapixel sensor with a rather impressive f/1.7 aperture. Definitely larger than most smartphone cameras. Plus, it offers Dual Pixel PDAF for faster autofocus. All in all, the OPPO F3 Plus’ cameras are fast, ensuring you won’t miss those fleeting moments. It could do with some more brightness and color accuracy, however, and doesn’t exactly differ much from its predecessor in terms of quality.. So how will the OPPO F3 Plus stand out from a host of eerily similar smartphones? The company is carving a niche market that caters specifically to a selfie-loving crowd. A crowd that, more often than not, is composed of a younger generation that is more budget-constrained, if not budget conscious, than the target market of high-end premium smartphones. Selfie camera? Obviously, check, twice even! Sub $500 price tag? Of course.. Despite not being top-tier, the OPPO F3 Plus is definitely top-notch and is more than capable of handling what most smartphone users will throw at it. OPPO is often underestimated, undeservedly, even though it comes out with admittedly impressive smartphones every year. The F3 Plus’ main enemy, however, will be itself and its past. Aside from the dual front cameras, it doesn’t exactly stand out from its predecessors in significant ways. OPPO’s F line is due a huge refresh, especially considering recent trends in the mobile market. Hopefully, OPPO will finally be able to integrate its own new technologies that it has been boasting of for the past two MWCs.. Topics Android oppo Phone Reviews Phones smartphone.

We have here the successor to the F1 Plus, the OPPO F3 Plus.. Last 2016, we saw the emergence of smartphones that promised to offer high-quality selfie cameras. And this year, it seems like the title “main camera” now belongs to the shooter at the front.. We continue to see new devices from different companies that have front-facing cameras with the same, or even better, camera specs on paper than the ones at the rear.. And this change in trend actually makes sense, since most of the consumers today are taking more selfies than taking photos with the main camera. The mobile camera technology really has come a long way.. If it isn’t still obvious, the OPPO F3 Plus is one of these new breeds of this kind of handsets. Heck, what were you expecting? It’s from OPPO. But the thing is, despite having all of the best-in-class selfie-taking capabilities, is it a good all around package? Is the steep Php23,990 price tag justifiable? Let’s figure that out in our full review of the OPPO F3 Plus .. OPPO might have made minor tweaks with the F3 Plus’ looks, but the change is vaguely visible. This device still looks very similar to the handsets before it. This phone, together with the OPPO F1s and the OPPO A39, which I have also reviewed before – all share the same iPhone-ish look. The all-white face and the Gold back plate, plus all the other tiny accents sure make it look like an Apple smartphone.. But what OPPO developed on this device is something that they call “Six-String antenna lines”. Instead of going to the traditional antenna lines that have a thick and obtrusive look, OPPO redesigned it. It not only made the smartphone looked better, but it also improved signal quality (more on that in the Connectivity section).. OPPO stripped the antenna bands into six super-slim lines that are divided into threes and positioned at the top and bottom of the back panel. The OPPO F3 Plus is also wrapped with chamfered edges, which are etched at the back panel. It also blatantly shows the partition with the front glass.. The OPPO F3 Plus, just like most “Plus” smartphones that are out today, has a large and phablet-y profile. Other than its large 6-inch display, the device also has a slightly sizable chin and forehead. This is forgivable considering all the hardware packed into it. And besides, OPPO was able to make up for it by having an ultra-thin side bezel of only 1.78mm. People with smaller hands might find it really challenging to operate this phone with one hand. The device can also take a lot of space in your purse, or leave a huge bulge in your pockets. On the other hand, the F3 Plus also has some noticeable weight to it, but still quite light for a phablet with this size.. Taking a tour, we have the said 6-inch Full HD display in front, earpiece, proximity and ambient light sensors, capacitive buttons, and the redesigned home button/fingerprint scanner. The highlight of this device is placed on top – the dual front-facing cameras. All of these are covered and protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 5.. At the left, we have the volume controls, while the right houses the lock/power switch and the SIM Tray. The buttons aren’t the most satisfying thing to press, but still decently tactile. They have and ultra-thin profile and are only slightly protruded.. Probably the main downside of the OPPO F3 Plus is the hybrid implementation on the SIM Tray. I have always praised OPPO by still having two SIM card slot with a separate microSD card slot. But now, OPPO now joined the hybrid route that most companies went with. Instead of having the option to still use two SIM cards despite the presence of a microSD card, you are now left to decide to either add another SIM or expand your storage (up to 256GB).. The top only has the noise-cancelling microphone. At the bottom, we have the loudspeaker, microUSB port, the primary built-in microphone, a 3.5mm headphone jack and a Torx screw that binds everything together.. It looks like OPPO is still grounded and has no plans on flying to the future by still including a 3.5mm headphone port, but it would have been nice to see a USB Type-C implementation rather than the standard microUSB port. And besides, this may have something to do with the F3 Plus’ VOOC fast charging technology.. The loudspeaker of the OPPO F3 Plus is pretty impressive performance as well. The volume is loud and can easily fill a quiet room. The low frequencies are present, although the highs are a tiny bit distorted at high volumes. However, the placement at the bottom can have it easily muffled when using the device in landscape orientation.. At the back, we have the 16-megapixel primary camera with dual-tone flash. We also have here the said Six-String antenna lines, the OPPO branding, and the ugly regulatory compliance logos.. Overall, the OPPO F3 Plus feels well-made and has some killer looks. Unfortunately, people with small hands might struggle using this handset with one hand.. The device has a 6-inch Full HD IPS TFT display, which has a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution and a total of 367 pixels-per-inch. The display can also register touch even if your hands are wet or under a glove, as per my testing.. Quality wise, the display delivers good performance. The colors are punchy and not exaggerated, blacks are deep, and sharpness is unquestionable. Together with its enormous profile, this display is perfect for immersive media consumption.. The OPPO F3 Plus can also get bright. However, the outdoor visibility performance isn’t really that impressive. You can hardly see the things projected on the display during extreme daylight scenarios.. The OPPO F3 Plus packs some serious power inside. The device sports the latest Qualcomm MSM8976 Pro Snapdragon 653, which has an octa-core processor consisting of two sets of quad-core processors: 1.95GHz and 1.44GHz. There’s also a large 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 510 GPU. This chipset is part of the new range of mobile processors from Qualcomm that are targeted for mid-range devices. But despite the mid-range title, the chipset was still able to play nicely with the entire hardware of the phone. It also made the gameplay performance enjoyable. Titles like Real Racing 3 and UFC was playable at decent frame rates. A processor-demanding game called Sim City: Build it is also running without any noticeable hiccup. But on the downside, the device tends to heat up during extensive and long hours of gameplay.. The huge 4GB of RAM is also great. You can easily switch between different applications in a jiffy. You can watch an hours length YouTube video and scrub through the timeline without causing the video to reload.. There’s also a spacious 64GB of built-in storage inside the OPPO F3 Plus with 52.27GB usable for the user. Despite the chunky cut for system files, a 52.27GB worth of space is still large to store a lot of your applications, videos, photos, music, etc.. Other than the device’s looks, OPPO might also have gotten some inspiration from Apple when they designed the new Home Button/Fingerprint scanner. The said button now works just like the one seen on the iPhone 7.. The hardware is now just the sensor itself, and it happens to direct you back to the homepage once the device is unlocked. The mechanical button is now gone – and I’m not missing it at all.. But unlike the button found on the iPhone, the one on the OPPO F3 Plus isn’t pressure sensitive. This means it can only distinguish a single and long press. It also doesn’t have that sophisticated haptic engine that replicates the feeling of hitting an actual button, so it feels weird at times.. The fingerprint scanner is one of the fastest that I have ever tested and it was able to detect my fingerprint successfully almost 95% of the time.. The OPPO F3 Plus runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with the company’s own ColorOS 3.0 on top. Despite being not the latest Android version, it’s still a step up from their previous devices. The OPPO F1s , for example, only has Android 5.1 Lollipop on it.. Probably the reason why OPPO is always behind updates is because of the optimizations they must make for the ColorOS. The company should always make sure that their own user-interface will work seamlessly. It would have been easier if they just ditched the ColorOS once and for all. But considering that it is one of the main identities that sets OPPO smartphones apart from its Android competitors, then we can’t expect to see this going anywhere anytime soon.. With that said, I’m still not impressed with the ColorOS interface (If you read my previous OPPO reviews , you’ll understand). Just like the design, the interface blatantly got a lot of inspiration from Apple’s iOS interface. The Helvetica Neue fonts, the minimalistic icons design, the native apps’ layout, and the Settings Menu. While it actually made the interface look aesthetically pleasing, there are sacrifices to be made. A lot tiny Android features are gone and I have also noticed a lot of glitches. For one, an Instagram Like notification would show a different image and username; the screen would also change in orientation even when the Screen Rotation button is unticked. Sometimes, simple things like this add up and it can definitely piss off its user.. But other than those cons, some of Marshmallow’s features still managed to work well on this device. The Now on Tap works seamlessly with the OPPO F3 Plus and it lets you summon Google’s Voice Assistant and Google Searches from what’s on your screen. Google’s voice recognition is still one of the best in the industry today as it can accurately distinguish the words you’re saying despite the accent and ambient noise.. It lets you control what an application can have access to within your phone. While it is a nice security feature, having to constantly Allow/Deny the pop-up is a little annoying if you’re constantly trying new applications.. The OPPO F3 Plus’ interface sure looks good and works faster and steadier, but it really needs a lot of polishing.. Let’s get right into the goods. The OPPO F3 Plus has a dual front-facing camera. There’s an 8-megapixel front shooter with a 120° wide-angle lens for when you want to take group photos. But if you want to go solo and wanting to take a selfie without stretching anything, then there’s also a 16-megapixel secondary front-facing camera.. Both sensors on the front can take excellent photos. The colors are good, the contrast and exposure are also impressive for if you set it right, the dynamic range is decent, sharpness and details are also good, with the standard 16-megapixel camera being sharper, of course.. The wide-angle lens can surely fit a lot of subject in one frame. But if you didn’t frame it correctly, the subjects at the edges would look a little stretched and distorted. Also, it would have been nice of other third-party applications like Snapchat and Instagram Stories supports a secondary front-facing camera, as it currently works only with the built-in camera app.. Speaking of the camera app, the OPPO F3 Plus is also come equipped with what the company is calling the Beautify 4.0. The feature has a bunch of built-in filters that helps your skin appear smoother, there is also some on-screen watermark that shows your current location and the temperature.. The app also lets you enable the Bokeh effect, which utilizes the two cameras to isolate the subject from the background by completely blurring. The feature kind of works, but it cannot distinguish the foreground and background perfectly. And before we forget, there’s a 16-megapixel shooter at the back, with a Sony IMX398 sensor that has a 1/2.8-inch sensor that OPPO says Sony exclusively developed for them. There’s also a wide-open f1.7 aperture.. The images that the OPPO F3 Plus can produce are undoubtedly beautiful. Colors are good with punchy colors but not overly saturated, contrast is also impressive, sharpness and details are also present, and zooming-in can still recover a lot of details. The camera a decent dynamic range performance, but still quite impressive.. The OPPO F3 Plus can also shoot 720p videos, 1080p at 30fps and 4K at 30fps. Video recorded at 4K resolution looks incredibly sharp. The image shown below isn’t a real still image taken, it’s a screenshot from a 4K video recorded from the phone. Colors and contrast are also impressive while the dynamic range is fairly decent. However, I have noticed some stuttering on the videos recorded on handheld. Future software updates can fix this for sure. But for now, taking non-pro videos would be the best bet.. The OPPO F3 Plus only comes with the essential set of radio antennas. Despite the flagship status, this thing doesn’t have NFC or any other fancy medium for wireless connectivity. The handset support GSM, WCDMA, FDD-LTE and TD-LTE for its dual nano SIM cards. There’s also a WiFi 2.4/5GHz 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and Bluetooth 4.1. The six-string antenna lines also slightly improved the WiFi performance of the OPPO F3 Plus. I could still get a wireless signal on the place where connection usually cut off.. One of the benefits of having a large smartphone is that it gives the manufacturer the ability to fit in a huge capacity battery. And that is also the case with OPPO F3 Plus. There’s a whopping 4000mAh capacity battery on this bad boy. Partnered with its VOOC fast charging, this thing is all geared up in the power department.. During my tests, the OPPO F3 Plus could easily last through a whole day, with still a comfortable amount of juice left to utilize when I get home. My day usually starts at 4 am and ends at 7 pm. And by that time, I’m still left with around 15%-20% to use throughout the night. That’s a whole day of web browsing, exchanging text messages, streaming videos online and offline, and listening to music on my daily commute.. The VOOC charging also works well, although it only works with the supplied adaptor. I was able to get from 15% to 100% in around 1-hour and 30-minutes. While a quick 5-minute charge gave me an extra 9%.. There are a lot of things to love and hate on the OPPO F3 Plus. The company’s strategy of getting “inspirations” from a renowned smartphone brand has been working its charm as the company is one of the highest-profiting smartphones in the country today.. The OPPO F3 Plus is an evidence that they’re planning on continuing this strategy. And why not? It’s been working really well for them. A lot of Android users admire the iPhones hardware and software looks and having and Android smartphone that mimics those desirable traits sure is enticing to them.. The OPPO F3 Plus has a sturdy and stunning build, a large and sharp display, an ultra-fast fingerprint scanner, an impressive set of cameras, powerful processor, and a sizable battery capacity. All of this constitutes to an impressive all-around smartphone – a device that can almost do anything.. However, I really do think that the interface still needs a lot of polishing – a hurdle that can be easily fixed with a software update.. The OPPO F3 Plus is definitely the best smartphone that the company has ever released in the Philippines, but it is definitely not the best one in the market today. At a steep asking price of Php23,990, there are already a lot of other devices who offer more for less.. One good example of a competing device is the OnePlus 3T. It has been officially launched in the country by Digital Walker with a starting price of Php24,990. With that, it offers a better processor, USB Type-C, user interface, and more.. But the thing is, only a few of these competing smartphones offers a dual and ultra wide front-facing camera, a feature with a niche market. If you’re really all about that selfie and groufie game, then the OPPO F3 Plus is really the phone to get.. You can buy the OPPO F3 Plus on all OPPO stores, kiosks, and dealers nationwide for a price of Php23,990. It’s also available at Home Credit in flexible installment plans..

I brought this phone from Australia for my brother but I did not know that this phone is available in India, also. It is made of Aluminium Alloy material and gives perfect grip over the phone. The phone have also got latest Gorilla Glass 5. So, do not worry - this phone is almost shatter proof. I was expecting at least AMOLED kind of display but this phone have got Full HD IPS display, which I think slightly lower than my expectations. However, under sunlight you will not have any trouble and phone display is pretty clear and produces as many as 16.7 Million colours. Besides, OPPO F3 Plus have also got Eye Protection mode. Please please use this mode while you are using the phone in dark environment. Eye Protection Mode restrict blue lights of the display and your eyes will not get strain. This feature is not there even in iPhone 6s. OPPO F3 Plus camera is truly wonderful. Selfies are great and rather than their 16MP selfie front camera, I liked their 8MP front camera with wide angle. My brother have clicked selfie with almost 14 members of my family together. 4000 mAh battery is sufficient for my brother. He is always on WhatsApp and other apps. And he is saying that he is very happy with the VOOC charging. It just takes few minutes to fill the sufficient juice in the battery. Overall the phone is good for multitasking. You can watch live videos very easily. You can play high definition videos with ease. 3D Animation games and high graphic games are also performing very well and there is no issue of phone heating up. If you are android lover - you must buy this phone. This is the best phone around budget of Rs. By arun dave on 22 August 2017. You should buy Oppo F3 Plus if you are looking at a phone with budget of between Rs.20,000 to Rs.25,000. This is best Oppo phone in this price range. Build quality is of metal and gives great grip. The finishing is almost like iPhone and even if it is made of metal, there is absolutely no problem of heating. Display is not that great but the touch is very smooth. I wish, they should have gave at least Quad HD resolution. Camera is the top feature of this phone. Oppo Camera phones are probably the best in the market. Battery performance is not great but I have gave 4 stars because of fast charging. It takes less than an hour to fully charge the phone on flight mode.. OPPO F3 Plus QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.

Roydon Cerejo , 23 March 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The phone features a secondary wide-angle front camera for group selfies. Overall app performance and battery life are both very good. The Oppo F3 Plus is priced at Rs. Oppo F3 Plus design and build quality Oppo F3 Plus specifications and features Oppo F3 Plus performance. Oppo has had a good run with its photography-centric ‘F series’ ever since. the Oppo F1 ( Review ) launched in February last year. Since then, we’ve also had the F1s. ( Review ) and the F1 Plus. ( Review ) smartphones to fill different gaps in the mid-range segment. Oppo is still promoting this series heavily today, both online and offline, and we’re pretty sure it has been a major contributor to the company’s strong position in the Indian market .. In 2017, Oppo is hoping to expand its reach with the new F3 series, of which. the F3 Plus is the first model. continue to be the target here and for that reason, Oppo has outfitted this phone with dual front cameras. ( Review ), the second camera isn’t used for depth of field. Instead, the Oppo F3 Plus has a wide-angle lens for group selfies, which actually seems like a much more practical idea that's likely to have a. Oppo usually caters to people shopping in the sub-Rs. 20,000 price segment, so the sticker price of Rs. 30,990 for the F3 Plus might be a little difficult to digest. Has Oppo done enough to justify this kind of a price premium? Let’s take a look.. Oppo has rarely disappointed us when it comes to build quality and design, and the F3 Plus continues that tradition. The metal unibody feels very sturdy and its rounded edges make it easy to hold. Despite the soft-touch finish, we didn’t find the phone too slippery during our usage. The 6-inch display really dominates the front of the phone, thanks to thin borders on the sides. Striking looks aside, there’s still no getting around the fact that this is a big phone, and quite heavy too. Just like the Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro ( Review ), single-handed use is nearly impossible without the risk of dropping it. You can shrink the display area down in single-handed mode if you simply cannot use two hands.. The fingerprint sensor is quick for unlocking the device, and just like before , you can use it for other purposes like locking apps and files. There are backlit capacitive buttons on either side of it for navigation. The dual front cameras and sensors are at the top. The buttons on the sides are a bit of a reach, even for someone with large hands. The headphones socket, speaker and Micro-USB port are placed at the bottom. There's a SIM tray above the power button, and is the hybrid type, so you’ll have to choose between a second SIM and a microSD card (up to 256GB is supported).. The 6-inch display on the Oppo F3 Plus. looks sharp thanks to the full-HD resolution but colours are too heavily saturated which can make images look a bit unnatural. There’s no option in the Settings app to adjust this either. Touch response is good though, and the phone has Gorilla Glass 5 protecting the display.. The back of the phone is rather plain with just a slight bump for the camera breaking the flat surface. Oppo has tried something new with the design of its antenna bands here to give the F3 Plus some visual differentiation from the competition.. Overall, we have no qualms about the design and finish of this phone. It isn't the easiest to live with due to its size, but if that’s your cup of tea, then you should be happy.. It’s a little strange not to see a USB Type-C port, especially given that this is an upper mid-range 2017 smartphone. In the box (which is rather large), you get a headset, ear tips, a silicone case, instructions, a SIM ejector, a USB cable and a sizeable power adapter that supports Oppo’s VOOC Flash Charge Mini standard. The phone also ships with a pre-applied screen protector.. The Oppo F3 Plus is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652. 653 SoC, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage, which is a pretty solid set of specifications. Benchmark numbers might not be as good as what's possibile with a top-end Snapdragon 821 SoC, which can be found in the OnePlus 3T at a similar price, but you’d be hard pressed to actually tell the difference in daily usage.. The F3 Plus does put up a decent show in benchmarks, scoring 92,497 in AnTuTu and 35fps in GFXbench. Other specifications include dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, USB-OTG, and the usual suite of sensors, including a gyroscope. Some notable omissions include FM radio and NFC. Many might not care about the latter but local radio is still important, and might be a deal breaker for some.. The software situation is a little disappointing as the F3 Plus still runs ColorOS 3.0. On the bright side, Google Assistant is present, and it worked well on the phone. Nothing else has really changed since we last took ColorOS for a spin when we reviewed the Oppo A57. The interface and icons still have an. iOS-like feel but they’re not blatant copies like we’ve seen on devices by some other Chinese manufacturers. Additional settings for most system apps like the Gallery and Camera can be found only in the main Settings app (just like in iOS) instead of having them within the respective apps, so there are some unnecessary steps when choosing common settings.. The notifications shade still drops all the way down, which is not needed if you simply want to get to the quick settings toggles. Also, notifications are shown on a different tab in the shade, forcing you to swipe away from the toggle switches every time you need to get to it. The F3 Plus features a ‘Lockscreen magazine’ which cycles through random wallpapers based on the categories you pick. This can be switched off if not needed. You also get motion and screen-off gestures and a backup service called O-Cloud for your contacts and SMSes.. Pre-installed apps include the Google suite, Facebook, Instagram, and WPS Office. Oppo also has its own app store for those who couldn’t be bothered signing in to the Play Store.. ColorOS seems well optimised, as general performance is very good for a phone with these specifications. Apps load quickly and multitasking is handled well. On average, we always had roughly 2GB of RAM fee which is a good amount of headroom for running demanding apps and games. 4G worked well for us, and there’s support for VoLTE too. We also didn’t face any issues with call quality during our review. The upper portion and edges of the phone get. hot when charging and downloading apps or files, but with regular usage, the phone seldom heated up too much.. One of the advantages of lugging around a massive smartphone is the ability to really enjoy watching videos on such a large screen. The F3 Plus is great for catching up on your favourite shows while travelling. We weren’t too happy with the oversaturated colours, but if you aren't too picky, you probably won’t mind. The single speaker is quite powerful, and sound is loud and fairly distinct. Audio enhancements from Dirac can be enabled if you have a headset plugged in. The bundled headset has a snug fit but sounds. Rather than depth-of-field tricks, like on the Vivo’s V5 Plus, the 8-megapixel sensor and its lens offer. a much wider field of view. This helps you cram more people into a frame for group selfies. Pictures taken under good lighting are fairly detailed but there is a fish-eye effect, so you'll see barrel distortion in the background. The secondary front camera has a f/2.4 aperture, which isn’t wide enough for noise-free shots.. Tap to see full-sized Oppo F3 Plus camera sample. On the other hand, the main 16-megapixel front camera offers better low-light performance thanks to its f/2.0 aperture. You can switch between the two cameras easily using an icon next to the shutter button. We found the screen flash to be pretty useful at night, and we like how it. automatically adjusts its intensity depending on ambient light.. With all of this going on in the front, Oppo hasn’t ignored the rear camera. It also has a 16-megapixel sensor, but there's dual PDAF and an f/1.7 aperture. The latter specification is similar to what the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Moto G5 Plus offer,. and while having such a wide aperture does help by reducing noise and allowing brighter low-light shots, the quality is still far from what the big brands can deliver.. Macro shots in low light, shadows and highlights have very good dynamic range, but textures aren’t very sharp and finer details still look a bit blurry. This is only really noticeable if you look at photos at their full size. Without zooming in, pictures look good.. Tap to see full-sized Oppo F3 Plus camera samples. Daylight shots have very good detail and saturated colours that really pop. Close-up shots are also well defined, although the edges of subjects in focus exhibit some artifacting due to oversharpening. Video recording maxes out at 4K, and while the quality is good, we could have used some stabilisation. We also noticed slight focus hunting issues at times, though this isn’t too bad.. The camera app has few features but all the important ones that you’d want are present, including an Expert Mode for manual control, filters, panorama, and timelapse videos. is good, and we didn’t notice this slowing down much in low light.. The Oppo F3 Plus packs a non-removable 4000mAh battery which lasted us well beyond a single day. In our controlled HD video loop test, we managed to go an impressive 17 hours and 12 minutes before the phone gave up. Oppo’s VOOC Flash Charge Mini standard is supported - "Mini" indicates the use of a smaller adapter. You will need the specific cable that comes with this phone, as the standard doesn't work with most common Micro-USB cables.. Verdict Oppo has priced the F3 Plus at Rs. 30,990, which is considerable premium over the brand's usual offerings. The F3 Plus faces tough competition from the OnePlus 3T and Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017). In fact, you can even find the LG G5 selling for as little as Rs. The F3 Plus does offer a lot for what you would pay. You get a well-built and good looking device, a sharp display,. a capable SoC, and very good cameras. In fact, the second camera on the front is actually useful for a change and doesn't feel. A couple of things are amiss, like the lack of NFC and FM radio, and the heavily saturated colours of the display. However, our biggest gripe is the fact that the phone doesn’t ship with Android Nougat, which is even more of a downer now that Android O has been announced already. We reached out to Oppo to understand the status of an Android N update but didn’t receive any conclusive response, which makes us. wonder if it’s coming at all. We hope that this model isn't left two generations behind.. If the F3 Plus was a lot more affordable, we could have given it the benefit of the doubt.
