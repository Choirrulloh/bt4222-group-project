Splash-resistant curved body with aluminum chassis. Video sound is recorded in mono. The back cover of the blue version is prone to smudges. Some might find the device a tad too thick. Nexus 6 by Motorola marks a shift in market positioning for Google's smartphone lineup. Whereas the duo of LG-made devices that precede it cut back on certain features to stay attractively priced, the Nexus 6 is ready to rub shoulders with the best in the Android realm. It is no longer simply an Android reference phone, but a true Google flagship, both on paper and in person.. Motorola Nexus 6 has a special place in the history of Google's smartphone family. The 6" phablet development took place during Google's ownership of Motorola (the storied manufacturer became a Lenovo company several days ago), so it is as pure in philosophy as it is in terms of OS.. Rumors about a Nexus smartphone by Motorola began to circulate as soon as Google finalized its acquisition of the manufacturer back in 2012. It has been over two years since the deal took place, but, we must admit, it looks like the wait for the handset was well worth it. Motorola Nexus 6 is brimming with the best hardware available for Android today, coupled with a brand new Android version that packs a host of new features.. Motorola Nexus 6 offers some of the best hardware available for mobile devices at the moment. The combination of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 SoC, 3GB or RAM, and a 6" QHD display should please even the pickiest Android user, as will the front-facing stereo speakers.. The device's 13MP camera with optical image stabilization and UHD video capture is a big deal too. It is a welcome sight in an area that has traditionally been overlooked in the Nexus family of devices for a long time.. Android 5.0 Lollipop is undeniably the cherry on top of the hardware cake the device has to offer. The latest OS release, in addition to the brand new material design, packs groundbreaking runtime called ART. The latter makes everything about Android feel smoother and more responsive.. Top-end hardware, a brand new software revision, and flagship-worthy price tag carry heavy expectations. Read on to find out if Nexus 6 meets them. As always, we will kick the review off with unboxing, followed by design and build quality inspection.. Editorial: You may notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include some of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written away from our test labs. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the device in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Unboxing, design and build quality, display.

I KNOW that it is coming according to Google. I'm not going to get excited about an anonymous source when there isn't a price verification for both on and off contract and release date. That article gave no new information about the phone and was basically a fluff piece. It certainly wasn't worth posting here IMO.

Nexus 6: 6.26 x 3.24 x 0.39 inches (159.2 x 82.3 x 10mm), 6.49 ounches (184g). 6.22 x 3.06 x 0.28 inches (158.1 x 77.8 x 7.1mm), 6.07 ounces (172g). Samsung Galaxy Note 4: 6.04 x 3.09 x 0.33-inches (153.5 x 78.6 x 8.5 mm) and 6.21oz (176g). The Nexus 6 is official and the big news is it is BIG. Google has jumped on the phablet craze and create a handset which not only goes head-to-head with Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus, but also the incredibly popular Samsung Galaxy Note range.. Size isn’t the only change, however, the Nexus 6 upgrades every aspect of the Nexus 5 and manufacturing duties have also switched from LG to soon to be ex-Google company Motorola. Screen Size: 5.96-inches, 2560 x 1440 (2K) Native Resolution. The most striking feature of the new Nexus will also be its most controversial: a mammoth 5.96-inch QHD display (493 pixels per inch). In surpassing both the size and native resolution of even the iPhone 6 Plus , it may finally get the Nexus range the attention it deserves.. Motorola Nexus 6 running Android 5.0 'Lollipop' (image credit: Google). The screen looks set to impress beyond its headline grabbing specifications. There is no sapphire on display, but there will be the ubiquitous Gorilla Glass 3 seen on almost all flagship mobile devices, including the new iPhone 6es.. On the flip side, there will be those desperately disappointed that Google has steered the Nexus range away from phones completely and I count myself among them. Much as it would have been nice (logical?) for Apple to have kept a 4-inch iPhone 6 model in addition to the new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhones, the loss of a circa 5-inch Nexus is a shame.. At least the Nexus 5 will get Android 5.0 (now officially ‘Lollipop’) and Android Volta should improve its biggest shortcoming: battery life (more further down).. Motorola Nexus 6 (image credit: Google). Previous years have seen Google’s manufacturer of choice tweak their current flagship phones for the Nexus variant and this is the case again as Motorola has effectively supersized its superb Moto X (for the record, my phone of the year ).. The good news is this means not only is there a curved design, but the Nexus 6 has the same super slim bezels as its smaller inspiration and (while still huge) this allows it to stay in the same ballpark as the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus and 5.7-inch Galaxy Note 4:. Chances of another phablet Bendgate ? Very unlikely. In the numerous (at times ludicrous) bend tests conducted on phones other than the iPhone 6 Plus, the Moto X came top of the tree.. Read more: Motorola Moto X (2014) Review: The Year's Best Smartphone. Since the Nexus 5 the Google range has looked to drive cutting edge Android performance and with the shift to a huge new form factor it is no surprise the Nexus 6 is doing the same.. The phablet features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 chipset comprised of a quad-core Krait 450 CPU at up to 2.7 GHz per core and cutting edge Adreno 420 GPU. Quite simply there isn’t an Android phone or phablet to top it at present. The Note 4 matches it while the Galaxy S5, HTC One M8, Moto X and others all use the older 801 chipset.. The Nexus 6 also backs this up with 3GB of RAM, again a match with the Note 4 and 801-based OnePlus One phablet. The new Nexus is again at the head of the pack and is unlikely to feel off the pace for at least a couple of years..

https:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ phones/ news.php? p=4617. Google Details September's Android Security Patches. Google today made its monthly security patches available to select Android devices. September's patches plug a significant number of security holes that threaten most Android devices. Google found dozens of vulnerabilities, including a number of which classified as critical, or able to remotely execute code. Some of problems are related to specific hardware and the associated software drivers that control them, such as components from MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Broadcom. Other vulnerabilities impact the kernel, system, and media framework directly. Google is pushing two separate patches to cover these problems, one dated September 1 and the second dated September 5. Google said the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus Player, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P devices will receive the September security patches as part of the upgrade to Android 8 Oreo. Google has already posted factory images for download from its web site. Google's handsets will receive both patches in a single download. As far as Google is aware, none of these security holes have been exploited by hackers or other entities. Google has already given the patches to its device-maker partners. Phone manufacturers are responsible for updating their own smartphones with the patches.. Nexus 6 Earns Android 7.1.1 from Google. Google this week said the Nexus 6 smartphone from Motorola should receive the Android 7.1.1 update in the days ahead. The updated system software installs the new app shortcuts, round app icons, the image-enabled keyboard with new emoji, and various bug fixes. The Nexus 6 does not get some of the best features available to the new Pixel phones, such as Google Assistant. Knowledgable users can manually install 7.1.1 using the factory images available from Google's web site, but the update will be distributed over the air soon.. Pixel and Nexus Phones Snag January Security Patch. Google today made a small security update available to Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P, and Nexus 5X that plugs some vulnerabilities. In total, some 95 fixes are in store for Google's handsets that also provide Google's Android smartphone partners "with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices." Two patches are being issued, one for all Android devices in general (given to smartphone makers), and one for the Pixel and Nexus phones directly. As per usual, the vulnerabilities range from moderate to critical, with the most severe able to remotely execute code and/or take over impacted phones. Google says it has fielded no complaints or reports of these vulnerabilities actually being exploited. The over-the-air updates for the Nexus and Pixel phones will arrive in the next day or so.. Google Releases Final Developer Preview of Android 7 Nougat. Google today made the fifth and final preview of Android 7 Nougat available to app developers and beta testers.

Google says the preview contains the latest bug fixes and optimizations across the system and in preinstalled apps. In addition to the operating system images for Nexus and other preview devices, the fifth developer preview contains an emulator for final app testing and the final Android 7 APIs. Google says it will release Android N later this summer.. Google's Project Fi Earns An International Speed Boost. Google today said Project Fi subscribers now have access to faster wireless speeds when traveling around the world. Google partnered with mobile network operator Three to increase the number of countries in which Fi is available to 135, as well as improve mobile data speeds by a factor of 10 to 20. Project Fi customers were perviously only able to roam at 2G speeds when abroad, but now have access to faster 3G/4G service. Google does not charge Fi subscribers any extra access fees when traveling; the data rates are the same at $10 per 1 GB whether at home or abroad. Google said new Project Fi customers can buy a Nexus 6P for $349 ($150 off) for the next week. Project Fi requires a Nexus smartphone. The service uses a mix of WiFi and cellular service from Sprint, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular to maintain a strong, fast connection.. Google Reveals When Nexus Phones Will Cease Receiving Android Updates. Google revised its Nexus support page and provided more information on how long Nexus-branded phones will receive future software updates. Google says Nexus devices will get Android version updates (Lollipop, Marshmallow, etc.) for at least two years from when the device became available on the Google Store. The Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X, for example, will receive Android system updates at least through September 2017, while the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will receive updates through October 2016. Security patches will be pushed out for three years from the original availability date or for 18 months after the device is removed from the Google Play Store (whichever is longer). Major Android update arrive generally once per year, while security patches are pushed through one per month. Android version N is expected to arrive later this summer.. Google Details May Security Update for Android. Google today highlighted its May security patch, which is first being delivered to Nexus smartphones and tablets. The patch resolves 25 issues, of which six are considered critical. The most severe could enable remote code execution via certain media files, as well as through a Qualcomm WiFi driver and an Nvidia video driver. Google says it discovered the vulnerabilities earlier this year and alerted its parters to the risks on April 4. Google has already made the patch available in factory image form via the Google Developer Site. It will release the associated new builds to the Android Open Source Project within the next 48 hours, and will push the update over the air to Nexus handsets in the next few days. Google said, as far it is aware, none of the vulnerabilities were exploited. Google provides monthly security updates to Nexus-branded Android handsets..

The update, which will be pushed out in waves, is available as an over-the-air download. Google today also posted the factory images of Android 6.0 Marshmallow for Nexus devices to its web site. The factory images are for flashing manually onto the Nexus devices. The factory images are for knowledgable users who know how to side load the operating system from a PC; they are not meant for most consumers. The Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X, which are available for pre-order and will ship later this month, will have Android 6.0 Marshmallow preinstalled. Android 6.0 adds revised permissions, Google Now On Tap, Nexus Imprint fingerprint security, and better battery management..

Existing handsets, such as the LG-made Nexus 5 and the Motorola Nexus 6, will be able to install the brand new operating system from Google. The Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P will ship with Android 6.0 on board. Android 6.0 Marshmallow brings a number of new features to the platform, including Google Now On Tap. Google's improved voice assistant is more aware of context when users make requests, and will automatically offer up certain types of information. Google Now is also accessible via voice command even when the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P are locked. Marshmallow adds fast scrolling and faster search, as well as new animations and new notification behaviors. Further, the app drawer will learn which apps people use throughout the day and offer suggestions each time they open the drawer. Android 6.0 introduces a new permission model, and allows people to remove more unwanted apps. Marshmallow was first detailed by Google in May. The company did not say exactly when it will be released.. Google to Push Monthly Security Updates to Nexus Phones. Google today said it plans to push security patches to Nexus-branded Android devices on a monthly basis to make sure they remain protected from potential and developing threats.

Google says the update contains fixes for the StageFright vulnerability and other issues submitted over the last few weeks by its carrier and handset partners. Google will simultaneously release security fixes to the public via the Android Open Source Project. Google committed to updating Nexus devices with major operating system versions for a period of two years, and security patches for a period of three years or 18 months from the date on which the phone is discontinued for sale.. Sharp Develops 4K Smartphone Display Prototype. Sharp has engineered a 4K (Ultra HD) screen for smartphones. The prototype measures 5.5 inches across the diagonal and includes 3860 x 2160 pixels, giving it a pixel density of 806 pixels per inch. By way of comparison, the iPhone 6 Plus's 5.5-inch screen has 1920 x 1080 pixels, or 401 pixels per inch. The prototype LCD relies on Sharp's IGZO technology, but the company is not sure if the prototype will ever be used. "Currently there are no driver ICs for small 4K panels, so the panel is not ready for mass production at this point," said Sharp spokeswoman Miyuki Nakayama in an email to Computerworld. Some of today's flagship devices (LG G4, Motorola Nexus 6, Samsung Galaxy S6) have jumped from full HD to quad HD, or 2560 x 1440 pixels. The majority of high-end phones still use full HD screens, while mid-range phones have moved to 720p screens. Entry-level phones generally offer 800 x 480 or 960 x 540 resolution displays..

Two tablets and T-Mobile's Z915 LTE 4G Hotspot also support the 700MHz airwaves. T-Mobile is supplementing its AWS-based LTE network with its 700MHz holdings in select markets around the country.

"The incorrect software prevents the phone from starting up properly. We will provide replacements for consumers whose phones are affected. The problem has been corrected and the phones currently shipping are fine." When asked, Motorola denied that shipments were halted or recalled because of the bug. The issue appears to only affect the AT&T variant of the Nexus 6.

Google Highlights Android 5.0's Security Improvements. Google today offered some insight into the steps it has taken to protect users through changes made to Android 5.0 Lollipop. For starters, Lollipop uses encryption by default. All the key communications tools (calls, messages) are encrypted and can't be accessed by others. Second, Google has improved the lock screen in order to encourage more people to use it. In addition to PIN codes and passwords, users can make use of trusted Bluetooth or NFC devices to unlock their device, or even smile at the user-facing camera. Last, Android 5.0 Lollipop works harder to sandbox apps from one another. With Android 5.0, Security Enhanced Linux Enforcing mode is required for all applications on all devices. This means apps can't share information with other apps without the user's permission. Android 5.0 will first ship on the Nexus 6 smartphone and Nexus 9 tablet. It will reach older Nexus devices in November.. Google Publishes Android 5.0 Preview, Updates SDK. Google today made available several significant tools for developers ahead of the general release of Android 5.0 Lollipop. First, Google released updated developer images for the Nexus 5, Nexus 7 (2013), ADT-1, and the Android emulator. Developers can install these near-final builds of Android 5.0 on their hardware and use them for testing purposes. Google also updated the software developers kit for Android 5.0. The Android 5.0 SDK includes improved tools that allow app writers to develop against the latest Android platform using API level 21. It also lets developers take advantage of the updated support library to implement Material Design on smartphones and tablets, as well as the leanback user interface for Android TV apps. The preview images and SDK can be downloaded through Google's Android developer portal.. Google Shows Off Nexus 6 Smartphone, Nexus 9 Tablet. updated Oct 15, 2014, 11:28 AM. Google today announced Android 5.0 Lollipop and with it the first few devices to run the new operating system, the Nexus 6 and the Nexus 9. The Nexus 6 is a large-screened smartphone made by Motorola. It has an aluminum frame and a 6-inch quad HD display with a 13-megapixel main camera. The camera includes optical image stabilization and HDR+ for improved low-light shots. The device has stereo-speakers with high-fidelity sound and comes with a turbo charger for fast charging. Google claims the device can get up to six hours of battery time after plugging it in for just 15 minutes. The Nexus 6 will be available for pre-order in late October and in stores in November. Google will sell an unlocked version through the Play Store, and the Nexus 6 will also be sold by AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. The device costs $649 at full retail, which is $200 more than the Nexus 5. The Nexus 9 tablet is made by HTC and features an 8.9-inch 2048 x 1536 screen with a brushed aluminum design. It is run by a dual-core Tegra K1 64-bit processor with each core clocked at 2.3GHz. Other features include an 8.0-/1.6-megapixel camera configuration; BoomSound speakers; dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth 4.0, and LTE; and a 6,700mAh battery. The Nexus 9 will be available for pre-order on October 17 and in stores starting November 3. The Wi-Fi model starts at $399.. updated Oct 15, 2014, 11:04 AM. Google today said the next version of Android, which it has so far referred to only as Release L, will be called Android 5.0 Lollipop. Google previewed Lollipop earlier this year and has offered it in beta form to developers for several months. It includes a refreshed look and feel that Google calls Material Design. Google has been slowly updating the core Android apps with Material Design over the last few weeks. In Lollipop, Google has re-envisioned the lock screen to incorporate more of the notifications, as well as the ability to automatically unlock the device when a trusted wearable is nearby. Lollipop will also offer a new keyboard design. Moving forward, Lollipop will rely on the ART runtime engine instead of Dalvik, which has served for several years. Google says ART offers a two-times improvement in app performance across the platform. ART is also more memory efficient, and is optimized 64-bit processing. The platform includes the Android Extension Pack to improve graphics performance. Google took time to improve the platform's efficiency, too. Project Volta, for example, took aim at helping OEMs and developers improve battery life by more optimizing their apps. Further, Lollipop adds its own Battery Saver tool to help extend the life of a battery when it reaches critical levels. Lollipop builds in more malware protection and ways for Android users to secure their device and make sure apps are scanned for safety. For example, Google is adding a kill switch to Lollipop, which allows device owners to remotely disable their handset if it is lost or stolen. Android 5.0 Lollipop will be available on the Nexus 6 smartphone and Nexus 9 tablet when they debut later this year.. Subscribe to updates on this phone with RSS.

The Motorola Nexus 6 is the sixth generation of Google's Nexus lineup of stock Android smartphones, which offer the latest and greatest version of the operating system in its unadulterated form.. The Nexus 6 is the largest Nexus smartphone ever, with a 6-inch display that makes it nearly as large as a tablet and makes it perfect for videos and games. It's the first Nexus smartphone to have a Quad HD (2560x1440 pixels) display, which means that despite the big screen, images come out extremely sharp no matter what content you might be viewing. The display employs AMOLED technology, making it more colourful and vivid than most of the phone's predecessors.. A Snapdragon 805 processor powers the Nexus 6, with four operating cores clocked at 2.7GHz. Since the phone runs Android in its stock avatar, it is extremely smooth, fluid and fast at everything, from opening basic apps to running the most graphically intensive games. The Nexus 6 is also the first device in the series to feature 3GB of RAM , making multitasking a great experience as it can keep a lot of apps running in the background without slowing down.. The Nexus 6 boasts a very capable camera as well, with a 13-megapixel sensor on the rear that takes detailed photos. The camera has an f2.0 lens that captures more light than competing cameras, and also comes with optical image stabilization that reduces blur in images and videos. A special HDR+ mode allows users to take photos that have a higher dynamic range. The front camera isn't as great with a 2-megapixel resolution, but it still takes impressive selfies and produces a clear video stream when you're video calling with your friends and family.. The phablet comes with 32GB of internal storage, which like previous Nexus phones is not expandable. However, users can take advantage of Google's cloud storage service Drive, which offers free unlimited storage for photos up to 16-megapixel in size. The smartphone features dual front-facing speakers for stereo sound, and its design curves in a way that makes it comfortable to hold despite the gargantuan display. There is a 3,200 mAh battery in the device for keeping the lights on, with quick charging support that enables up to 6 hours of use with only 15 minutes of charging.. The Nexus 6 is the world's first smartphone to run Android 5.0 Lollipop, which introduces a beautiful new user interface and a slew of interesting features, such as support for notifications on the lockscreen and a battery saver mode.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Talk time: 24.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 13.8 days (330 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback.

The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..
