The dual-selfie camera and big screen is definitely a boon. By Pranjal Singh | 21 Jan 2018. The Canvas Infinity Pro looks good in terms of display and design. While the front camera clicks some good selfies, do not expect much detailing in the photos. The rear camera is also decent and offers some good results. Performance wise, the phone is sometimes laggy and you might also not like the customized user interface, although this is subjective.. Overall, at this price point, the Infinity Pro is a good option for selfie lovers and those who want a very good looking smartphone.. Was this review helpful?

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running..

Related Micromax launches 'Canvas Infinity Pro' with dual-selfie cameras at Rs 13,999. Price: Rs 13,999 Rating: **1/2 Specifcations: Snapdragon 430 octa core, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage (expandable, dedicated micro SD slot), 5.7-inch IPS LCD (1440 x 720 pixels; 279ppi), dual SIM, 4G with VoLTE, 16MP f2.0 rear camera , 20MP f2.0 + 8MP wide angle f2.2 front camera, FM, 3,000mAh, 160g. Pros: Good build quality, dual front camera with wide-angle mode, slim bezels. Cons: 720p HD screen resolution, Snapdragon 430 offers entrylevel performance, interface is sometimes slow/laggy, slow fingerprint scanner. If there’s two things that define the future of the smartphone, it’s dual cameras and 18:9 displays. Micromax doesn’t want to be too late to the game and that’s what the Canvas Infinity is about. The Canvas Infinity was, till recently, one of the most affordable phones with an 18:9 aspect ratio display and slim bezels (they call it Full Vision). The Pro version is an upgrade: it has a Snapdragon 430 (425 earlier), 4GB RAM (3GB earlier), 64GB storage (32GB earlier) and upgraded cameras (with higher resolution rear & dual front cameras). The 5.7-inch, 1440 x 720 pixel IPS LCD screen stays the same and dimensions are roughly the same too. The sleek design gives you a 5.7-inch display in the form factor of a 5-inch phone — it’s easy to hold in one hand. The highlight is the dual selfie camera: a 20MP + 8MP camera setup with flash that enables portrait mode (background blur) and Super Pixel mode (combines multiple photos into one for better low light images). Normally, the 8MP wide angle camera is used for depth sensing but you can also switch to it for group selfie mode. There’s also a front LED flash for low light. It has results which we could qualify as passable as long as there is good ambient light. There’s a bit too much noise, not enough detail and an almost laughable portrait (background blur) quality. The rear camera is 16MP f2.0 unit which we found offers generally better results than front camera with lower noise and better detail. As for the camera app, you get modes like panorama, time lapse, beauty mode, live filters, HDR, portrait, night and super pixel. As for the interface, it is powered by Android 7.1.2 and offers enhancements like one hand mode, gestures, smart action, customisable notification light and customisable Android buttons. There is some pre-loaded bloatware too though most can be removed. What we did not like is the general sluggishness — everything feels a tad bit slow, including the camera shutter and fingerprint scanner. We expected better at this price. We would have rated the phone higher if it was priced at under Rs 10k. At this price, it goes head-to-head with the new Honor 7X. We recommend the 7X over the Canvas Infinity Pro because it offers better performance, a much better and larger FHD+ screen, better dual rear camera and 4GB/32GB storage for just Rs 12,999. There’s also a 4GB/64GB version for Rs 15,999 though you don’t really need it because the storage can be expanded.. Want stories like this in your inbox? Sign up for the daily ET Panache newsletter.

What’s new in Micromax Canvas Infinity Pro over the Canvas Infinity. The new Micromax handset comes with a better processor, cameras, more RAM/storage and battery in comparison to the Canvas Infinity. Meghna Dutta | Posted on : December 6, 2017. Techook News What’s new in Micromax Canvas Infinity Pro over the Canvas Infinity. The Canvas Infinity features a single front camera sensor while the Infinity Pro comes with dual front facing camera. Micromax yesterday announced its latest smartphone under Canvas Infinity series, the Micromax Canvas Infinity Pro. The handset launched at a price of Rs 13,999 seems to be an upgrade over Canvas Infinity that they launched a few months ago.. Much like the Canvas Infinity, the Pro version flaunts a near bezel-less 18:9 display. While both the smartphones fall under the budget category, the Canvas Infinity Pro has more to offer (that’s why it is pricier than Canvas Infinity) in terms of hardware and imaging sensors. Let’s take a look at the new things that the home-grown smartphone maker has added on the Canvas Infinity Pro for a Rs 4000 premium.. Micromax Canvas Infinity Pro hardware and storage. In terms of SoC, the Canvas Infinity Pro fares slightly better compared to the Canvas Infinity. The former is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC, while the latter carries a quad-core Snapdragon 425 chipset. Further, Micromax has packed in more RAM and storage on its new smartphone. The Canvas Infinity Pro now gets 4GB RAM and 64GB onboard storage as opposed to 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage on the non-pro version.. Micromax has really bumped up the camera sensors on the Canvas Infinity Pro. That may be the main reason. why the company is charging a little extra for this new handset. This time, Micromax has forked two imaging sensors up front with the main sensor sporting a 20MP unit while the second sensor has an 8MP unit with soft LED flash. There is a Super Pixel feature as well that combines multiple images to bring in a high-res image.. The Canvas Infinity meanwhile houses a single camera setup featuring a 16MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture. The front-facing camera has real-time bokeh selfie and smile shot.. The rear camera on the Pro version has been upgraded as well. The Canvas Infinity Pro now comes with a 16MP rear camera sensor instead of a 13MP unit found on the Canvas Infinity. The camera app on the Infinity Pro comes pre-loaded with features like portrait mode, auto scene detection, face beauty mode, face gallery etc.. The Micromax Canvas Infinity Pro comes with a slightly bigger battery capacity compared to the Canvas Infinity. The Infinity Pro is equipped with a 3000mAh battery while the Canvas Infinity packs a 2900mAh battery. Both smartphones, however, claim to offer a similar standby time of up to 420 hours on a single charge.. While these are the few differences that set the two handsets apart, there are a bunch of features common to both the phones. Both smartphones ship with Android Nougat 7.0 OS, have a dedicated microSD slot for expandable storage of up to 128GB. Further, the handsets feature a 5.7-inch Full Vision display with HD (1440 x 720 pixel) resolution with 18:9 aspect ratio.. In a nutshell, the Canvas Infinity Pro has some improved innards over the Canvas Infinity. But if you are budget conscious and do not need a dual front camera, and can compromise on a bit of RAM and internal storage, you should opt for the Canvas Infinity which sells for Rs 9,999. However, if you are a selfie-enthusiast and looking for a bit more processing power, you can head to Flipkart to purchase the new Micromax Canvas Infinity Pro. The new Micromax phone will be made available for purchase on the e-retail site starting today.. Next Flipkart sale offers Xiaomi Mi A1 at Rs 2000 discount for limited period.

Samsung Galaxy On7 Prime Review: The goods and the bads. Micromax Canvas Infinity Pro review: Good design, average camera, but is it worth it?. Home Reviews. 16 MP, f/2.0, autofocus, LED flash. Dual 20 MP f/2.0 + 8MP f/2.2, LED Flash. Micromax had launched the Canvas Infinity Pro earlier this month. The latest phone from domestic smartphone maker is an attempt to adopt the two most followed trends of the year 2017- dual cameras and 18:9 displays. The Canvas Infinity Pro comes with an 18:9 aspect ratio display with slim bezels and dual selfie camera.. This is not the first phone from Micromax with 18:9 display – the company also has the. Canvas Infinity with the same form factor. The Pro version is an upgrade to the original Canvas Infinity – it comes with a Snapdragon 430 processor instead of Snapdragon 425, 4GB RAM/64GB storage (3GB/32GB earlier) and upgraded cameras. Let’s find out how Micromax’s latest offering performs in the real world.. The Canvas Infinity Pro looks premium – its compact unibody design makes it easier to hold. Despite featured a 5.7-inch display, the sleek design and the 18:9 aspect ratio makes it easy to hold the phone.. On the front, the Canvas Infinity Pro has a 5.7-inch HD+ display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, minimum bezels and on-screen navigation buttons.. The back side of the phone features rear camera with single LED flash and below it, there is a fingerprint scanner. The Micromax branding sits near the bottom.. On the top of the phone, you get a 3.5mm audio jack, with the rest being bare.. The micro USB port and the speaker grill is at the bottom.. The left side as usual features the sim card tray, while the power button and volume rockers are on the right side.. Micromax adopted the 18:9 display earlier too, and the same display is used in the Infinity Pro. The phone comes with a 5.7-inch HD+ (1440 x 720 pixels) IPS LCD display with good viewing angles. The minimal bezels make the entire experience better, but the display performance in daylight leave something to be desired.. Talking about the cameras, the highlight of Canvas Infinity Pro is its dual selfie camera. The phone comes with a 20MP + 8MP camera setup with a front flash. The secondary camera offers portrait mode and there is another Super Pixel mode which combines multiple photos into one for better low light images. There’s also a front LED flash for low light selfies.. Normally, the secondary 8MP camera is used for depth effect but you can also use it for group selfie mode, as it has a wide angle lens. The front camera offers some good results as long as there is good light. There’s a bit noise in low light and artificial light selfies and not enough details. The portrait mode (background blur) also struggles sometimes.. On the rear, the Infinity Pro comes with a 16MP camera with an f/2.0 aperture. You also get modes like panorama, time lapse, beauty mode, live filters, HDR, night and superpixel with the rear camera as well.. As for the hardware, the Canvas Infinity Pro is powered by an octa-core processor from Qualcomm. The Snapdragon 430 is an entry-level processor coupled with 4GB RAM which is sufficient enough for regular day to day usage and some moderate gaming too.. The Canvas Infinity Pro is powered by Android 7.1.2 Nougat and offers features like one hand mode, gestures, smart action, customisable notification light, and buttons. There are some preloaded apps, though most of them can be removed.. In real world, the Infinity Pro lags a bit sometimes and the overall performance is not up to the mark, all things considered.. The Canvas Infinity Pro features a 3000mAh battery which Micromax claims can offer 200 hrs of standby time. Connectivity options on the phone include 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, and USB OTG support..

Micromax Canvas Infinity Pro with 18:9 Display, Dual Selfie Cameras Launched: Price, Specifications. Jagmeet Singh , 04 December 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Micromax Canvas Infinity Pro is priced at Rs. Canvas Infinity Pro will go on sale through Flipkart on December 6. The smartphone sports a 20MP+8MP camera setup for selfies. Micromax on Monday launched the Canvas Infinity Pro as its new 18:9 display featuring model in India. The Micromax Canvas Infinity Pro with a price tag of Rs. 13,999 will be exclusively available on Flipkart starting Wednesday, December 6 midnight. In August, the Indian vendor ventured into the market of bezel-less smartphones with the Canvas Infinity that was launched at Rs. The Micromax Canvas Infinity Pro features a 5.7-inch Full Vision display with HD (720x1440 pixels) resolution and 18:9 aspect ratio. The display panel is also claimed to have 450 nits of brightness. Under the hood, the smartphone has a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC, paired with 4GB of DDR3 RAM and 64GB onboard storage. There is a microSD card slot to offer storage expansion (up to 128GB).. Micromax has provided a 16-megapixel camera sensor on the rear of the Canvas Infinity Pro along with an LED flash, while its front panel includes two camera sensors with 20-megapixel and 8-megapixel resolution. The smartphone also comes preloaded with features such as portrait mode, face beauty mode, auto scene detection, face gallery, and tale album. Additionally, there is a Super Pixel feature that combines multiple images to provide users with a higher resolution image.. Similar to the Canvas Infinity ( review ), the Micromax Canvas Infinity is equipped with a fingerprint scanner that is touted to unlock the screen in 0.2 seconds and can accept fingerprints with a 360-degree acceptance angle. The smartphone runs Android Nougat with a custom skin on top. There are also standard connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Micro-USB. Besides, the handset packs a 3000mAh battery that is claimed to deliver 20 hours of talk time or 420 hours of standby time on a single charge.. "We understand that in the mid-premium range smartphones, consumers demand a complete package - a smartphone that has best in class cameras, a screen that is large enough for content viewing, a battery that doesn't drain in a day and of course aesthetics that are a head turner. We truly believe that Infinity Pro is that package and our consumers will be delighted with the pricing as well. We are known to bring revolutionary products within the range of millions of Indians and this is another step in that direction," said Shubhodip Pal, chief operating officer, Micromax Informatics, in a press statement.. Unlike the Micromax Canvas Infinity Pro, the previously launched Canvas Infinity had a Snapdragon 425 SoC, coupled with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage. The handset also had a smaller, 2900mAh battery. However, one thing that broadens the distinction between the two Canvas Infinity handsets is the dual-selfie camera that Micromax has provided on the newer model..
