Moto Maker is available in select markets at launch. It is hardly a surprise that the third generation Motorola Moto G is one of the most anticipated smartphones of 2015. After all, in less than two years after the first iteration of the smartphone (Moto G became the most successful phone in the company's history) made its debut, the Moto G product family has successfully redefined what a budget Android handset should look, feel, and perform like and how much it should cost.. In order to stay on top of this highly competitive smartphone segment, the Moto G (3rd gen) packs a considerably improved hardware in comparison to the outgoing model, while keeping the same $179.99 starting price tag.. The newcomer features a beefier 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 chipset and 2GB of RAM on board, as well as a 13MP main camera with 1080p video capture and 5MP front-facing unit.. However, the above specs are not the new Moto G's trump card. The device's IPX7 water-resistant body and customizable colors promise to put the smartphone head and shoulders above its competitors.. Unlike its predecessor which was an evolutionary upgrade over the first generation, the Moto G (3rd gen) has taken a massive leap forward hardware-wise. The handset's 64-bit chipset and the available 2GB of RAM promise to fully utilize Android Lollipop, while the 13MP main camera will likely punch above the device's price range.. The option to customize the XT1540 Moto Maker and the IPX7 certification are a first for the Moto G family. In addition to being attractive for current Moto G owners looking forward to upgrade, the features open Motorola to an even wider audience of potential customers.. This year's Moto G is one of the first major products that Motorola launched with Lenovo at the helm. At a quick glance, it appears that the Chinese tech giant has kept the same winning formula that Google introduced during its tenure as an owner of the storied American company and will further augment with the retail distribution chain they already have in place throughout the world.. As always, we'll kick our review off with an unboxing of the new Moto G, followed by a closer look at its design and hardware. Head over to the next page to find out if the smartphone lives up to the promises delivered by its feature set!. Unboxing, design and build quality, controls.

See all the best 3rd Gen Moto G deals. When it comes to budget smartphones, no one does it better than Motorola. For three long years, the Moto G has reigned supreme over every other cut-price handset around, and with the launch of the new Moto G4 , Motorola looks set to continue that reign long into the future.. So where does that leave last year's 3rd Gen model? Well, while the Moto G4 is a significant step up from the 3rd Gen Moto G in almost every way - including speed, battery life, camera and general screen quality - it is also considerably larger, as its screen measures 5.5in rather than 5in like its 3rd Gen sibling. Not everyone wants or might be happy with such a big phone in their pocket, so the 3rd Gen model is still worth considering if you're after something a bit more compact.. Of course, there will come a time when the 3rd Gen Moto G will become increasingly hard to find, but thankfully that moment hasn't come just yet, as it's still widely available SIM-free for £130 and on contract for around £9.50-per-month on contract with an upfront cost of £20 from Carphone Warehouse .. It's still a great smartphone, too, and it continues to beat almost every other cheap handset you can buy today. the fact that you can now download a free system update for Android 6.0 Marshmallow as well means it's as bang-up-to-date as it can possibly be.. The 3rd Gen Moto G is a much more refined handset than its chunky-looking 2nd Gen predecessor. Admittedly, its specs haven't moved forward quite as much as I'd hoped, but Motorola's superb build quality and sheer number of extra features more than make up for it.. ^ If you choose to customise your Moto G using Moto Maker, you can personalise the rear shell cover and metallic accent. However, it's important to note that there are actually two versions of the 3rd Gen Moto G you can buy at the moment, as there's a basic model which comes with 8GB of default storage and 1GB of RAM, and a more advanced model with 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM.. Admittedly, the extra storage isn't so much of a problem thanks to the Moto G's microSD card slot, but the extra RAM will affects the phone's overall speed and multitasking capability. I'll explain more about this on the next page.. With two different specifications, that also means two different prices. The entry-level model, for instance -. the type available to buy through most retailers and networks, as well as direct from Motorola via its customisable Moto Maker service - is currently available for around £130 SIM-free. If you want the 16GB and 2GB of RAM model, you'll have to pay an extra £30, taking the total to £150.. Regardless of which model you choose, though, the new Moto G's design is far superior to any other budget handset I've seen from Motorola so far. Taking several design cues from Motorola's Moto X series, the metal effect frame curves almost seamlessly into the removable back plate, creating lovely smooth contours.. While its overall girth of 11.6mm isn't particularly svelte, the edges taper to a pleasing 6.1mm and its weight of 155g makes it feel very strong and durable. I much prefer it to the flat, angular edges of the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua and Samsung Galaxy A3 , and even the gorgeous rubbery finish on the HTC Desire 626 can't quite compare to the sheer comfort afforded by the 3rd Gen Moto G. The machined, textured finish on the power button is a particularly nice touch as well, as this makes it much easier to find in comparison to the flat volume rocker.. The Moto G's removable rear panel is also a boon rather than a curse. These come in a variety of different colours and can be swapped in and out as you please, making it much more personal and customisable than any other handset at this price. It certainly beats having to make do with the slightly dull finishes on the EE Harrier and Vodafone Smart Ultra 6, and each Moto G grip shell and flip case also comes with a subtle ribbed texture. This feels very classy under your fingers, and provides an excellent amount of grip, which is vital if you're going to use Motorola's ingenious hand gesture shortcuts to access certain parts of the phone.. A double karate chop will turn on the phone's rear flashlight, while a double twist of your wrist will instantly open the camera. I wouldn't feel quite so confident performing these actions on other handsets, and it's these kind of thoughtful handy features which help set the Moto G apart from the rest of the crowd.. Likewise, when the back is properly clipped into place (and you're reminded as such as soon as you turn on the phone), the Moto G becomes waterproof thanks to its IPX7 rating, meaning it can be dunked in up to one metre of water for up to 30 minutes without taking damage. It's not entirely watertight, though, so if you do happen to drop it down the loo, you'll need to make sure you take off the back and give it a quick wipe, as we found a fair few droplets still lingering beneath the shell during our testing.. Underneath the rear panel, you can access the micro SIM card slot and microSD. There's full 4G support, of course, but it's a shame the microSD card slot only takes cards up to 32GB. Still, that should be plenty for most users, in addition to the 8GB or 16GB of memory provided – although only 4GB or 12GB is actually available to the user after taking Android and other apps into account.. As far as I can tell, the 3rd Gen Moto G uses an almost identical screen to the one used on the 2nd Gen Moto G. Both have a 5in 1,280x720 resolution display, which I think strikes just the right balance between screen size and pixel clarity, and our colour calibration tests bore very similar results.. ^ The 3rd Gen Moto G (left) has a much more refined design than the 2nd Gen Moto G (centre) and the 2nd Gen Moto E (right). For instance, our colour calibrator showed it was displaying 85.4% of the sRGB colour gamut. This is around average compared to other budget phone displays, and while it obviously can't compare to the rich vibrancy of the Galaxy A3's Super AMOLED display, our resulting colour gamut had a very even spread across all the main primary colours. Reds were weakest, but skin tones looked much more natural than rival phone displays, such as the HTC Desire 626, when I lined them all up side by side. I also preferred it to the 2nd Gen Moto G's screen, which also looked very warm and pink compared to the new model.. Black levels were reasonably dark at 0.36cd/m2 on max brightness, and the screen's contrast levels of 1,061:1 provided plenty of detail. Likewise, the Moto G's viewing angles were excellent, even at more extreme angles. However, you'll struggle to make out darker images and video scenes when using the phone outdoors, as its peak brightness of 339.38cd/m2 is only really suited for web browsing and using apps with lighter backgrounds when you're out in the sun..

The Guardian - Back to home. What term do you want to search?. Motorola’s latest Moto G is the best yet, but has crept up in price.. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian. Motorola Moto G (3rd Gen) review: the best budget smartphone just got better. All-day battery, 13-megapixel camera and waterproofing make this a great buy – even if it’s a little more expensive. Fri 7 Aug 2015 07.00. Last modified on Tue 21 Feb 2017 17.53. The Moto G inherits Motorola’s new curved design from its high-end Moto X smartphones with a removable back. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian. Screen: 5in 720p HD display (294ppi). Processor: 1.4 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 410. RAM: 1GB of RAM (2GB on 16GB storage variant). Storage: 8/16GB + microSD card slot (up to 32GB). Operating system: Android 5.1.1 “Lollipop”. Camera: 13-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel front-facing camera.

The Moto G inherits a 13-megapixel camera from the 6in Nexus 6. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian. Moto Actions provides two quick gestures for launching the camera or lighting the flash as a torch, both of which work well. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian. Motorola’s budget Moto G has grown up, but does a better camera, waterproofing and new features justify a more costly price tag?. The original Moto G redefined what a budget smartphone should be, when it launched in 2013. It was the first Android phone under £150 that wasn’t slow and infuriating to use, and it didn’t skimp where it matters.. Fast forward two years and the third generation Moto G provides much of what the original did right. But as smartphone technology has improved so has budget hardware. Where the Moto G stood alone as a beacon of good in a sea of rubbish, there are many more worth buying today.. So Motorola has pushed improved features, build quality and battery life, but in doing so it pushed the price to the very edge of the budget market.. The Moto G’s design has been refined and takes after Motorola’s Moto X and Nexus 6 phones. The glass screen is surrounded by metal-like plastic. The back now has a removable ribbed, curved plastic back and a silver metal bar that holds the camera.. It’s a simple design that’s easy to hold and won’t slip out of the hand. The build quality is also noticeably improved over last year’s model.. Waterproofing to IP67 standards means drops into 1m deep water for 30 minutes aren’t an issue, while a removable back hides a microSD card slot for more storage, but not a removable battery.. The curved back and sides are ergonomic, but at 11.6mm thick the phone is quite chunky by today’s sub-10mm standards. It isn’t noticeable in the hand, however.. The Moto G’s 5in screen has a resolution of 720p HD with a pixel density of 294 pixels per inch. It is noticeably crisper than the lower resolution Moto E , but not as sharp as more expensive smartphones with 1080p or higher resolution screens, such as the OnePlus One , Samsung Galaxy S6 or LG G4 .. The third generation Moto G has an upgraded 1.4GHz quad-core Snapdragon 410 and a choice of 1GB or 2GB of RAM depending on the storage variant.. The version with 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, as tested, feels slightly snappier than the previous generation Moto G, and is easily on par with all but the very fastest of smartphones.. The multitasking menu, which brings up a stack of cards showing previously used applications, is particularly snappy – something even smartphones costing £500 or more struggle with.. The Moto G consistently lasted one full day of use up at 7am with around 25% of battery left by 10pm in my testing, with constant push email, lots of notifications, 60 minutes of music playback over Bluetooth, 1.5 hours of browsing and a bit of light gaming.. Lighter usage should see the Moto G easily through two days between charges.. The Moto G comes pre-loaded with Google’s latest version of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop , which is a refined, easy to use and attractive mobile operating system.. Motorola also provides a few of its apps, which can either be used or replaced with others from Google or third-party developers. Of note is Moto actions which allow users to set up automated tasks such as silencing their phone when they get home or while in meetings, or motion controlled gestures such as a karate chop, which turns on the flash for a torch. Motorola’s Migrate utility also helps switch from an iPhone, transferring contacts and calendar entries as well as almost everything from another Android phone.. The Moto G’s camera is much improved over last year’s model. The 13-megapixel camera is the same as used in the Nexus 6 and produces decent images with good detail, colour and good low-light performance. It is considerably better than most of the competition.. The five-megapixel selfie camera is solid, producing decent photos for viewing on the phone. The photos lack detail at full resolution, however.. The simple Motorola camera app can be rapidly activated by a twisting gesture even when the phone is locked. Unlike most other camera applications, by default tapping the screen takes a photo rather than focusing. Holding down the screen activates burst fire, while sliding out from the left displays options and from the right the gallery.. It’s simple and works well most of the time, although occasionally it would miss what I was trying to focus on. Manual focus and exposure controls are available, but better third-party camera apps exist such as Google’s Camera app.. The third generation Moto G costs £159 for 8GB and £209 for the 16GB version with 2GB of RAM.. The Moto G can also be customised using Motorola’s Moto Maker, to change the phone’s back, front and side colours starting at £179.. The third generation Moto G is the best yet. The build quality is excellent, the screen decent, the phone’s performance snappy, and the camera is solid.. It feels great in the hand and the ribbed back makes it easy to grip. The battery life is also solid and waterproofing means it’ll survive a trip down the toilet. Not many Android phones come with screens as small as 5in, meaning the Moto G is arguably one of the best.. The biggest problem is the price. The 16GB version with the 2GB of RAM is recommended, but at £209 it is no longer very cheap, verging into the price range of the likes of the OnePlus One. Hopefully, like previous versions, it will drop in cost from third-party retailers soon.. As it stands the Moto G is arguably still the best budget smartphone available, even if it’s not quite as cheap as it used to be.. Pros: solid build, decent camera, good battery life, waterproof, decent screen, microSD card slot. Cons: not as cheap as it used to be, 8GB model only has 1GB of RAM, plastic edging easily damaged. • Motorola Moto G 2014 review: the best all-round budget smartphone. • Which is the best 2014 smartphone for less than £150?. • Top 5 phablets: Which is the best for big-screen smartphone lovers?. • Huawei P8 review: thin, powerful and undercuts the competition. © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Moto G XT1543 (Latin American model) with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. The third generation Moto G is an Android smartphone developed by Lenovo 's Motorola Mobility division, unveiled in India on July 28, 2015, [3] and released the same day. [4] The Moto G4 is its successor.. The third-generation Moto G has a 5-inch display with HD resolution of 1280x720p and features Corning Gorilla Glass 3, a 13- megapixel camera similar to the one from the Nexus 6 with many features including HDR imaging and an on-screen exposure setting option, a quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor, and the latest version of Android, 6.0.1 "Marshmallow" [ citation needed ]. The phone back is removable, and made of textured plastic. The back also comes in multiple colors available in Motorola's Moto Maker website. The Moto G 3rd-generation is water resistant through the use of nano-coating and internal rubber gaskets [ citation needed ] , giving it an IPX7 rating. [5] This water resistance gives the phone the ability to be submerged in up to one meter (or about three feet) of water for 30 minutes at a time with the back cover secured correctly. [6] The low-end model comes with 8GB of storage and 1GB of RAM, while the high-end model comes with 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM. [7] This phone also features a 2470 mAh Li-ion non-removable battery. Both models support LTE .. At launch, the phone ran a near-stock Android 5.1 Lollipop operating system, although it has since been upgraded to Android 6.0 Marshmallow , preloaded on new devices and upgradable via an OTA update for devices already on the Lollipop 5.1 OS. [8] The Android Marshmallow 6.0 update for the Moto G 3rd-generation was first widely rolled out in North America starting on December 24, 2015. [9] The phone has both a single- SIM and dual-SIM variant, availability of which vary by market.. *Band 12 is available with the Android M update.. A Moto G Turbo Edition with a faster eight core Snapdragon 615 processor, 2 GB of RAM, IP67 rating, and Quick Charging was revealed for sale in Mexico, Colombia, and India on 13 November 2015. The 3rd generation Moto G received a very positive reception upon release. The Moto G's performance from its 1.4. GHz Snapdragon 410 paired with either 1GB or 2GB of RAM was significantly faster than the 1.2. GHz Snapdragon 410 with 1GB of RAM in the Moto E , and almost as quick as devices powered by the more powerful 1.5. GHz Snapdragon 615 such as the Huawei P8 Lite , which has been attributed to the Moto G's largely bloat-free build of Android 5.1 "Lollipop". While the 2nd generation Moto G was regarded as a "sidegrade" rather than a true successor to the 1st generation (since it retains largely the same specifications), the Moto G 3rd generation was considered a big improvement over its predecessors. [11] The rear camera's photo quality (except in low-light conditions) was much lauded considering the Moto G's budget price (sharing the same sensor as the much more expensive Nexus 6 ) and its predecessors' poor camera performance. The IPX7 water resistance (unique among smartphones in its price range at the time) was also praised by reviewers. Ars Technica proclaimed "the fact that the Moto G is so competent drives home the superfluousness of so many flagship phone features—the move from 720p to 1080p to 1440p and beyond, faster SoCs, ever-thinner metal-and-glass slabs. Those things are all nice to have, but you’d be hard-pressed to argue that any of them are essential," [12] referring to the surprising value of the 3rd-generation Moto G considering its price.. There have also been some criticisms of the 3rd generation Moto G. For example, the IPS panel screen's calibration [ when defined as? ] was poorer than its 2014 predecessor. Despite brighter, more vibrant colours and wider viewing angles, the display still suffered from "muted" greens and "washed-out" outdoor performance. [11] [13] Low light camera performance was also criticized (with similar criticism also being leveled at the Nexus 6 , which shares the same camera sensor). The low-end configuration with 8GB of storage and 1GB of RAM leaves little more than 4GB out-of-the-box for user-accessible storage, although this was partially addressed with the inclusion of a Micro SD card slot expandable officially up to 32GB and unofficially up to 128GB. The lack of RAM on the low-end model has also been said to significantly reduce multitasking performance. The criticisms aimed at the low-end model would not be so much of an issue for the 3rd-generation Moto G if the higher-end model had been available in all markets, as some countries only have the lower-end model available. Multiple users reported having a problem with the microSD card reader, which would stop recognizing the SD card, leading to possible loss of data and inability to use the SD card. [16] The problem appears to remain unaddressed.. The Moto G3, like many older phones, is vulnerable to the series of vulnerabilities known as BlueBorne [17]. Retail versions of this phone are no longer receiving security updates according to the Lenovo Support Site [18] , so it will apparently remain unpatched (carrier support may vary)..

http:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=16223. Review: Motorola Moto G (3rd Gen). Motorola's mid-range masterpiece, the Moto G, is a formidable smartphone that should not be overlooked. It is waterproof, customizable, and outguns the competition on many fronts. Moreover, the $179 price tag makes it an incredible value for the dollar. Here is Phone Scoop's full report about this capable Android handset.. The Moto G is for people who want the best mid-range handset money can buy. No other phone provides as much value for the dollar as the Moto G, and it puts much of the competition to shame.. Motorola's middleweight contender has always represented a good value. Since it arrived in 2013, it consistently delivered a solid experience for less than $200. From an appearance standpoint, the 2015 Moto G makes only slight changes. Much of what's new is under the hood, but the hardware has been improved in several significant ways.. To start, Motorola now lets consumers customize the Moto G to a certain degree through its online Moto Maker tool. Black and white are the only two options for the front of the G, but Motorola is offering 10 different colors for the rear shell and 10 colors for the accent. The shells are all the same plastic material (no wood, no leather). Where there are thousands of ways to iterate with the high-end Moto X, there are only a few hundred ways to customize the Moto G. Even so, that's far more owner-input than most phone makers offer to their mid-range handsets.. Motorola's three main smartphones (X, G, E) bear a striking family resemblance. Each has the same basic look and shaping, with horizontal slits above and below the screen, rounded corners, and a figured rear surface that tapers towards the edges. The colorful rear shells are what give each handset its personality. The G shares these characteristics with its brethren.. By modern standards, the Moto G is an average-sized handset. Thanks to the 5-inch screen the phone is somewhat big, but it stops short of being over-sized like Motorola's own Nexus 6. The dimensions are nearly identical to last year's handset: it's 1mm taller, wider, and thicker, and just 0.2 ounces heavier. Most people will be pleased with the size, as it's easy to use one-handed. The phone could be thinner, but the overall footprint is acceptable. It should fit into most pockets without problem, but it might be noticeable if your pants are tight.. Motorola used good materials to assemble the phone, which is put together tightly. The rear shell is formed by a coated rubber and the seams are snug. The glass panel on front is fitted well in the polycarbonate frame that holds it in place. The G isn't made from the highest-quality stuff, but it's still made well enough.. The slits for the earpiece and microphone are the most obvious design elements visible on the front face of the phone, Sadly, these don't double as stereo speakers. The user-facing camera is also visible. The G does not have any physical buttons interrupting the glass face. There are no logos or trademarks anywhere, and I rather appreciate that.. Motorola placed the screen lock and volume buttons on the right edge of the Moto G. The buttons have a metal finish and jut out significantly from the speckled gray frame that holds the G together. The buttons are easy to find and use, and travel and feedback are quite good. I do wish the button positions were reversed, with the screen lock below the volume toggle, but maybe that's just me. The headphone jack is on the top edge and the USB port is tucked into the bottom edge. This leaves the left edge clean.. One of the biggest improvements the 2015 G offers when compared to its predecessor (and many other handsets) is its new waterproof design. The Moto G can handle up to 30 minutes in one meter of water, which means it will be safe from accidental drops in the pool, tub, toilet, or your morning bowl of Wheaties. I tested it under running water and in the pool and had no trouble with the phone. It survived a shower and a swim just fine.. In order to make the phone waterproof, Motorola futzed with the design of the rear shell. It's a bit more flexible than the shell on last year's phone, but is fitted much tighter. You won't have any trouble peeling the shell off, but take care to make sure it is fully reseated to ensure the gaskets are sealed, especially near the camera module.. The G supports micro SIM cards and microSD memory cards. The slots are positioned next to one another near the camera module under the rear shell. In the 2013 and 2014 models, it was simply a round circle on the back surface. Now, the module is part of a larger, bar-shaped metallic element that measures close to two inches long. It includes the camera lens, dual LED flash, and the now-standard indented Motorola "M" logo. The finish of the camera module is one aspect of the G that can be customized. You can put it to good effect to provide some contrast to the rear shell if you pick the right color combo for the two.. The Moto G is a solid piece of hardware that has some bona fide features (customizable colors, waterproof design) that many competing handsets don't. Toss in the good looks, solid build quality, and ease-of-use, and the Moto G is an all-around winner.. The G has a 5-inch LCD display with 1280 by 720 resolution. While I'd prefer to see full HD, the 720p HD works well with the G. I was not wanting for pixels. The resolution was more than adequate for watching YouTube videos, browsing the web, and scrolling through social network feeds. I didn't see any pixelated edges or have trouble reading text. Colors are accurate, and the screen produces plenty of brightness. I was able to use the Moto G inside and out with no issue. There's some brightness drop off when the phone is tilted side to side, but there's no blue shift. The Moto G has a very good screen for the money.. The Moto G comes in two major variants: one that supports GSM networks and one that supports CDMA networks. The major improvement with the 2015 Moto G is the addition of standard support for LTE networks. It can be used on the LTE networks of AT&T, Sprint (CDMA variant required), T-Mobile, and others in the U.S. We tested it on AT&T's network initially and it passed with flying colors.. The Moto G latched on to AT&T's LTE service everywhere we took it in the NYC region. The phone dipped to HSPA+ a couple of times, but so did other phones we had on hand for testing. The G was always able to make and receive calls and never missed any, even under the worst coverage conditions. I was pleased with data speeds. They were more than adequate for streaming tunes via Spotify, catching up on YouTube videos, and of course sending email, updating Facebook, and downloading apps.. The Moto G is an impressive voice phone. The earpiece produces prodigious amounts of sound when set at full volume. (It's almost painfully loud.) I easily heard conversations through the Moto G over the din of a raucous coffee shop. The earpiece speaker is prone to a bit of distortion when cranked all the way up, but thankfully you can leave it set at about 75% most of the time for loud and clear conversations. People I spoke to through the Moto G said I sounded "average.". The speakerphone also produces an insane amount of volume, so much so that you can easily hear calls in the car, at noisy backyard BBQs, and even bustling diners at lunch time. In fact, it's so loud I'd recommend you take the call outside or somewhere more private, because everyone will be able to hear both sides of your conversation.. As you might surmise, the ringers and alerts are plenty loud. The vibrate alert is what I'd call average.. I'm disappointed the Moto G doesn't have stereo speakers (like last year's model,) but music pumped through my favorite pair of earbuds sounded quite good.. Motorola increased the Moto G's battery from 2,070 mAh in last year's handset to 2,470mAh in the 2015 edition. The jump in capacity is nice, but it delivers only a modest improvement in battery life. In my tests, the Moto G lasted just more than a standard day (breakfast to bedtime). It often had 10 to 15% of a charge left at the end of the day. Last year's Moto G ran into trouble by 9pm a few times, but I didn't have that issue with the new model. It made it from morning to night consistently.. Android 5.1 Lollipop includes a basic battery saver tool and it is easily found on the Moto G. It can be set to come on automatically at 5% or 15%, or you can toggle it on/off manually. It reduces performance and limits vibrations, location services, and background data syncing to push the battery a bit more.. The Moto G includes Bluetooth 4.1 and the most common set of profiles. I paired it quite easily with a handful of other devices, such as headsets, my car, and my computer. I was generally pleased with the quality of phone calls via my car's hands-free system. They were loud and clear the majority of the time. Music pushed through my best set of stereo headphones was decent, but without the aptX profile, the Moto G fell short of what I've experienced with other phones.. The GPS radio worked well enough, but it really depended on WiFi for accuracy. For example, working alone the GPS radio was never more accurate than about 60 or 70 feet. With WiFi on, accuracy improved to about 25 to 30 feet, and that was the best I saw. Some phones can pinpoint me on a dime with GPS alone.. The Moto G does not have NFC.. Hands On with the Moto G. Motorola's mid-range wonder boasts a significant number of upgrades over last year's handset, making it a compelling option. Here are our first impression of this welterweight device.. We're live from Motorola's big phone event today in NYC. We're expecting at least one new phone, if not two or three.. Moto G Is Waterproof and Can Be Customized Via Moto Maker.

Headphone Jack (3.5mm), Water-Resistant, Memory Card Slot. Great review of the 2015 Moto G but the only version worth considering is the $229 16GB version.

Commuter Series Case for Motorola Moto G3 Reviews - page 2. Commuter Series Case for Motorola Moto G3 is rated. Rated 1 out of. I bought 2 weeks ago and it does not fit my cell phone.. Rated 3 out of. I bought this about a month ago. It protects my phone in case I drop it but when I need to charge my phone I have to take the cover off because the plug won't stay in the phone to charge and when I try to turn it off at night or other times its hard to push the button.. Rated 4 out of. Takes a brutal beating & phone still works. Rated 2 out of. I haven't had a chance to judge the trauma protection features yet, but I find it VERY difficult to press my power button. Also the touch response seems dull since putting on the screen protector. I don't dislike it enough to take it off but I'm not very positive about it either.. It looks like you are based in.

Community Join (Free Membership) Login About Us Informr Score Newsletter. The Motorola Moto G (3rd Gen) currently has an Informr score of 8.2 out of 10.. This score is based on our evaluation of 43. sources including reviews from users and the web's most trusted critics.. What's good Excellent battery life Decent camera performance in good lighting Smooth performance Customizable in Moto Maker service IPx7 rated. What's bad No optical image stabilization leads to blurry photos Lots of digital noise in low-light situations Mediocre viewing angles and sunlight legibility. Motorola proved with the Moto G 2 that budget phones could offer excellent hardware at a low cost. The company continues this tradition with the Moto G 3. At half the cost of premium smartphones, the Moto G 3 offers plenty of bonus features even flagship phones don't offer such as an IPx7 rating, which means it can be submerged in water for up to half an hour. As with the Moto X range, users can fully customize their phone with the Motorola's Moto Maker service. The phone itself features an all-plastic trim with curved corners and a curved rear. Instead of the soft-touch back of its predecessor, Motorola went for textured plastic for the Moto G 3 giving critics more of a grip. Despite the positives, Tech Radar describes it as a "chunky, largely plastic phone" though they add it is "perfectly fine." Other experts agree with this assessment and add that although it certainly feels cheap due to the plastic body it has a solid build quality.. The one thing Motorola did not upgrade for the Moto G 3 is the screen. It sports the same 5-inch, 720p display as its predecessor, leading to a relatively low pixel density of 294ppi. Still, critics were fairly satisfied with the screen overall as it provides accurate and bright colors. With that said they found overall viewing angles and sunlight legibility fairly average with Greenbot adding, "The display has a propensity to be a bit too bright at night, which can contribute to some serious eye strain.". The Moto G offers two different setups: 8GB of internal storage with 1GB of RAM or 16GB of internal storage and 2GB of RAM. Naturally the one with the higher storage and RAM ends up costing more than the base version. Both models come with a 1.4GHz quad-core processor and mid-level graphics processer. In general, reviewers describe the performance of both models as "zippy" though they did find the 16GB version to be slightly faster in comparison. The biggest selling point of the Moto G 3 isn't its performance, it is the battery life. The 2,470mAh battery provided experts with a full day of battery life with moderate usage and around 2 days of very light use. While the back cover of the phone is removable, the battery itself is not.. Another big upgrade for the Moto G 3 is the 13-MP main camera. When compared to camera on the Moto G 2, critics saw a marked improvement in picture quality. In good lighting situations they were able to capture images with good detail and vibrant colors, especially in HDR mode. It does not come with optical image stabilization so they unfortunately ended up taking a lot of slightly blurry photos. The problem became especially obvious when they took low light pictures. Not only did they have problems with the focus, the noticed pictures also had a lot of digital noise. Besides the main camera, it also upgraded the front camera to 5MP.. Overall, reviewers still consider the Moto G 3 the best smartphone for its price. Android Authority states, "The many positives of this handset definitely outweigh…the shortcomings in the display and camera." Wired adds, "The Moto G punches above its weight in almost every way…It's the clearest indication yet of the great things to come from truly affordable phones.". The third generation Moto G is proof that you don’t need to drop a tonne of money to get yourself a decent phone. It doesn’t have the fastest processor, the sharpest display or the best camera, but it does punch above its weight in all areas.. Budget handsets rarely have the consistent experience which the Moto G offers. You’ll struggle to find a device at this price-point with a better camera, while the battery life is more than enough for most users. Motorola’s continued use of a near-stock Android experience keeps things ru.... It’s amazing how much you can get for so little these days. The third generation Moto G, which provides users with the second-most-recent version of Android, a 5-inch display, great battery life, Motorola’s useful (but unobtrusive if you don’t want it!) software suite, and even som.... While there’s small points that can leave you wanting more – camera, battery charge-speed, only an okay screen – and you may or may not like the thick design, the Moto G is super phone for a comparatively low price. While the RRP is $369, we’ve seen it under $300 at even just.... If you’re looking for a good smartphone, you don’t need the latest and greatest, and you’ve got $200 burning a hole in your pocket – look no further than the Moto G. The customization options, high-res camera, and long-lasting battery take it to another level that most budget.... Motorola released the Moto G (3rd Gen) on July 29, 2015..

The third generation Moto G is proof that you don’t need to drop a tonne of money to get yourself a decent phone.

You’ll struggle to find a device at this price-point with a better camera, while the battery life is more than enough for most users. Motorola’s continued use of a near-stock Android experience keeps things running smoothly and the included Moto app manages to be more than just a gimmick. While the tweaks are most certainly subtle, it remains one of the best budget Android handsets that money can buy.. It’s amazing how much you can get for so little these days. The third generation Moto G, which provides users with the second-most-recent version of Android, a 5-inch display, great battery life, Motorola’s useful (but unobtrusive if you don’t want it!) software suite, and even... It’s amazing how much you can get for so little these days. The third generation Moto G, which provides users with the second-most-recent version of Android, a 5-inch display, great battery life, Motorola’s useful (but unobtrusive if you don’t want it!) software suite, and even some decent internals, starts at a mere $180 unlocked. You’ll undoubtedly make some concessions – especially in the build and camera departments – but if you’re just looking for smooth, up-to-date Android functionality at a cheap price, the Moto G is most definitely the phone for you.. While there’s small points that can leave you wanting more – camera, battery charge-speed, only an okay screen – and you may or may not like the thick design, the Moto G is super phone for a comparatively low price. While the RRP is $369, we’ve seen it under $300 at even just a cursory search. And that’s a massive $700 difference to something at the top level, which just isn’t affordable for some.... While there’s small points that can leave you wanting more – camera, battery charge-speed, only an okay screen – and you may or may not like the thick design, the Moto G is super phone for a comparatively low price. While the RRP is $369, we’ve seen it under $300 at even just a cursory search. And that’s a massive $700 difference to something at the top level, which just isn’t affordable for some. We couldn’t recommend it to someone who’s been using a modern flagship – basically anything equal or higher than a Samsung S6, iPhone 6, HTC M9, Huawei P8, etc. You miss out on too many creature comforts that were the reason you went for those phones to start with.. But if you’re hanging in there with your old iPhone 5 or Samsung S3, the Moto G will blow you away for what you get at the price. This will be the new go-to answer for this reviewer to the age-old “which smartphone should I get” to anyone who isn’t a serious power user.. If you’re looking for a good smartphone, you don’t need the latest and greatest, and you’ve got $200 burning a hole in your pocket – look no further than the Moto G. The customization options, high-res camera, and long-lasting battery take it to another level that most budget phones don’t come close to approaching.... If you’re looking for a good smartphone, you don’t need the latest and greatest, and you’ve got $200 burning a hole in your pocket – look no further than the Moto G. The customization options, high-res camera, and long-lasting battery take it to another level that most budget phones don’t come close to approaching. Motorola built a solid phone and didn’t compromise the spec sheet in any major way. The Moto G may not have cutting-edge specs, but it’s all the phone your average user needs. In fact, if you told a power user that this is the new flagship phone from Motorola, they’d need a discerning eye to figure out you’re lying. The Moto G is impressive, and for less than $200, it’s an incredible deal.. One of the best aspects of the Moto G remains the price tag: at just $180 for the 8GB model with 1 GB of RAM, this smartphone is exceptionally affordable and a very decent value proposition considering the hardware inside. Spending an extra $40 is worth it if you want more storage and RAM, but th... One of the best aspects of the Moto G remains the price tag: at just $180 for the 8GB model with 1 GB of RAM, this smartphone is exceptionally affordable and a very decent value proposition considering the hardware inside. Spending an extra $40 is worth it if you want more storage and RAM, but there’s no denying that either option is a great choice if you’re after an entry-level smartphone.. If you are caught in between this intense price versus hardware battle in the budget smartphone market, then you can safely consider buying the new Moto G. It caters well to the needs of most smartphone users who are looking to get a decent deal in the price range of between Rs 10,000 and Rs 13,0... If you are caught in between this intense price versus hardware battle in the budget smartphone market, then you can safely consider buying the new Moto G. It caters well to the needs of most smartphone users who are looking to get a decent deal in the price range of between Rs 10,000 and Rs 13,000. However, it is totally up to you whether you wish to spend that Rs 1000 extra for double RAM and ROM.. The Moto G is absolutely one of the best smartphones I’ve ever used that costs under $400. See what we did there? The Moto G is a excellent all-around smartphone that has enough to compete with higher cost devices. It’s only $179, but we’d gladly compare it to or recommend it over some more expensive devices.... The Moto G is absolutely one of the best smartphones I’ve ever used that costs under $400. See what we did there? The Moto G is a excellent all-around smartphone that has enough to compete with higher cost devices. It’s only $179, but we’d gladly compare it to or recommend it over some more expensive devices. Many manufacturers are trying to do what Motorola has done with the Moto G, and there are a lot of great cheap Android smartphones. At the end of the day though, the Moto G still takes the crown as the best budget smartphone. It might not deliver everything the Galaxy Note 5 has to offer, feature leather backs like the LG G4 or Moto X, or take great photos like the Galaxy S6, but for $179 it absolutely delivers everything one would need in a smartphone. The Moto G is still the best budget Android smartphone on the market, one I’d recommend without hesitation.. I’ve won over by the Moto G since the first iteration in late 2013. With the 3rd generation Motorola have improved on the original formula and brought water resistance and improved on the second gen’s bigger screen and body. I must say I really really like the Moto G 3rd generation. I’ve won over by the Moto G since the first iteration in late 2013. With the 3rd generation Motorola have improved on the original formula and brought water resistance and improved on the second gen’s bigger screen and body. I must say I really really like the Moto G 3rd generation. I like it so much I’m using it as one of my main devices and have even used one of my precious Google Play Music authorisations on it. The only thing I find myself wishing the Moto G 3rd gen had is an AMOLED screen, mostly so that Moto Display uses less battery power. Expandable memory, a great feeling device with reasonable battery life and a very recent Google-like version of Android are pushing all the right buttons with me: a bit like the onscreen ones…. The Moto G performs well above what’s expected for a phone that costs less than $200. The display is accurate, the processor can endure heavy multitasking, and the camera pulls off amazing shots. Find another phone that you can say the same about. Right, the only way you could is by spending hundreds of dollars more. But by spending $179, you’re getting a phone that performs smoothly and feels like it was crafted just for you. So many inconsistencies exist between devices of any price yet the Moto G can give flagships from other companies a run for their money.....

Motorola discovered a winning formula when it released the original Moto G in the fall of 2013. Based on stock Android and free of the bloatware that usually clutters the app drawer, it offered a compelling user experience for less than $200. At the time, roughly similar devices in terms of features and performance, such as the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini and the HTC One Mini, started out at well over $300.. While it was a good bargain, the original version was not perfect. One of the main criticisms was that it did not support LTE. About half a year later, in the spring of 2014, Motorola updated the Moto G to support LTE, removing this deficiency but adding $50 to the price. The updated version also brought microSD support, another much requested feature.. In the fall of 2014, the company launched the second-generation Moto G, which improved the cameras and bumped the screen size from 4.5-inches to 5-inches. The larger screen, however, led to a decrease in battery life as the battery size remained the same as the original. It also used the exact same Snapdragon 400 SoC at a time when other phones were moving to the 64-bit Snapdragon 410. This oversight made the Moto G (2nd gen) a harder sell, especially when Motorola launched the Moto E (2nd gen) in the spring of 2015 with the higher-performing Snapdragon 410 at a lower price.. 5.0-inch IPS @ 1280x720 (294 PPI). 5 MP, 1/5" Samsung S5K5E2, 1.12µm, f/2.2. 13 MP, 1/3.06” Sony IMX214 Exmor RS, 1.12μm, f/2.0, 27mm, AF, automatic HDR, dual-color LED flash.

The new third-generation Moto G fixes many of the issues it experienced during its sophomore slump. For starters, it now supports 4G LTE in its base configuration. It also gets upgraded to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 SoC, which has four 64-bit Cortex-A53 CPUs and an Adreno 306 GPU.. Sticking to a 5-inch 720p IPS screen makes the Moto G easy to use with one hand and small enough to slip into a pocket. The overall dimensions are up slightly, including the thickness, due in part to a larger battery that increases capacity from 2,070mAh to 2,470mAh. In theory, this should more than offset the higher power draw of the A53 cores and give the new Moto G an overall increase in battery life.. Motorola makes a few other hardware improvements too, especially to imaging. The rear camera gets a dual-LED flash, for more natural-looking colors in low light, and now uses a 13 MP Sony IMX214 Exmor RS sensor, the same sensor used in the Nexus 6 sans OIS. Around front, camera resolution increases to 5 MP. It also gets IPX7 certification for improved water resistance.. There are two different storage options for the Moto G (3rd gen): an 8GB model with 1GB of RAM for $179 and a 16GB model with 2GB of RAM for $219. Both models support storage expansion using microSD cards up to 32GB as well (including UHS-I cards).. The integrated modem inside the Snapdragon 410 SoC supports LTE Category 4 (LTE-FDD, LTE-TDD), which means downlink speeds of up to 150Mbps and uplink speeds of up to 50Mbps. It also supports UMTS (WCDMA, TD-SCDMA), CDMA1x, EV-DO Rev. Lucian Armasu is a Contributing Writer for Tom's Hardware US. He covers software news and the issues surrounding privacy and security..

Yay, one more seemingly decent ~$200 phone that isn't Asia-only.. Best value for money phone I have ever owned. Cannot believe the quality / specs at the price point. It's about as quick / specc'ed as my Nexus 4 that it replaces, but it trumps the Nexus 4 with it's expandable memory and 4G/LTE capabilities. I don't game on my phone, so that's never been an issue for me. I do note that app install speeds are very good; download speed I can't really say, as I do all of that on wifi, not cell. Had to choose the even cheaper Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 over this one.. Why is the ZenFone 2 listed in the specs / comparison table , but not on benchmarks? It's $20 cheaper than the Moto G 16GB/2GB. Only issue is it released a couple of months ago, but isn't getting Marshmallow. it is getting Marshmallow no? http://www.androidstandard.com/android-m-will-hit-moto-g-3rd-gen-and-2nd-gen-in-this-fall/. Only issue is it released a couple of months ago, but isn't getting Marshmallow. There are similar spec Chinese phone's with more than 2x lower price like for instance Elephane Trunk. I know it's weird Elephone made a decent phone but strange things happen. As much as Motorola got a developer community and long suport it's not worth 2+x.. There are two different versions of the ZenFone 2 (well more if you count the special editions). The less expensive version is shown in the spec table since it's closer in price to the Moto G. We only tested the more expensive version with a faster SoC, so that's why it's not in the benchmark charts. Plus, we already included the more expensive/faster Z8 as the upper bound in the charts. I figured this was more relevant, since it has a more common SoC configuration. - Matt Humrick, Mobile Editor, Tom's Hardware. Why is the ZenFone 2 listed in the specs / comparison table , but not on benchmarks? It's $20 cheaper than the Moto G 16GB/2GB. How many of those Chinese phones are available outside Asia? And what else are you sacrificing with them? One major advantage of the Motorola phones is *minimal* add-ons, and most of em aren't intrusive at all. Another point: I have high confidence that Motorola will release security patches very quickly. I have no confidence that some budget Chinese maker will put ANY effort into this.. No need to look at no-name brands either: Acer has a poor reputation with dropping firmware updates for their low-end devices merely months from launch.. I have high confidence that Motorola will release security patches very quickly. I have no confidence that some budget Chinese maker will put ANY effort into this.. Not much but hire is one & from Chinese firm behind it that is known for regular updates. It's currently available only in Asian Pacific region but Alcatel is officially present in much more (especially EU) countries than Motorola so it's expected that it arrives & on other markets. By all means it's not perfect but it beats Moto G 3rd gen in lot aspects that are important by the view of general users. As I don't want to advertise anyone I will mention only manufacturer & product name so if you are interested in more details browse & particularly pay attention to user opinions & review about it. How many of those Chinese phones are available outside Asia? And what else are you sacrificing with them? One major advantage of the Motorola phones is *minimal* add-ons, and most of em aren't intrusive at all. Another point: I have high confidence that Motorola will release security patches very quickly. I have no confidence that some budget Chinese maker will put ANY effort into this.. Moto continues to stomp the market with budget offering that leaves 600$ phones with big question mark near 'why bother'.. As a former 2nd Gen Moto G owner I'd say It's far from that situation.. Moto continues to stomp the market with budget offering that leaves 600$ phones with big question mark near 'why bother'.. The biggest problem with this phone is poor screen resolution. 5" screen with 720p is way too low. Get a Nexus 5 instead (still available through eBay). It's smaller with a proper screen. Has no SD card or waterproofing though. But has a faster CPU and already runs Marshmallow.. Alcatel Flash 2 is Asian market, and has limited LTE bands...questionable whether it'd work in the US.. 720p on a 5" display is already 293ppi, high enough that most people won't really notice resolution any higher than that unless they specifically look for differences. It may seem "way too low" for marketing purposes but as far as real-world usability is concerned, it is perfectly fine for an almost entry-level device. Personally, the lack of an SD slot on Nexus devices is a much bigger deal-breaker.. The biggest problem with this phone is poor screen resolution. 5" screen with 720p is way too low.. You can buy them all on amazon, they don't generally come with much bloat, and you get twice the phone the current moto g gives you. The main place you suffer is android updates. Imo this latest moto g is still not what the first one was. When that came out it combined what was at the time mid range hardware/screen/etc at a significantly lower price. Now it's distinctly low end with it's low res screen and slow processor.. How many of those Chinese phones are available outside Asia? And what else are you sacrificing with them? One major advantage of the Motorola phones is *minimal* add-ons, and most of em aren't intrusive at all. Another point: I have high confidence that Motorola will release security patches very quickly. I have no confidence that some budget Chinese maker will put ANY effort into this..

Some processors have a level 0 cache memory, which is accessed quicker than the L1, L2, L3, and so one cache memories. Besides achieving better performance, it also consumes less power.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. The frequency is the clock rate of the graphic processor (GPU), which is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. RAM (Random-Access Memory) is used by the operating system and all installed applications. Data in the RAM is lost after the device is turned off or restarted.. Information about the type of RAM used by the device.. Information about the number of RAM channels integrated in the SoC. More channels mean higher data transfer rates..

A smaller pixel size allows the image sensor to use more pixels thus providing better image resolution. On the other hand, this may negatively impact noise levels and decrease image quality at high ISO settings.. Crop factor is the ratio of the dimensions of a full frame camera's sensor (36 x 24 mm, which equals the frame size of a 35 mm film) and the dimensions of the image sensor of the device. The number shown is the ratio between the diagonals of a full frame sensor (43.3 mm) and the device sensor.. Aperture (f-stop number) indicates the size of the lens diaphragm opening, which controls the amount of light reaching the image sensor. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the diaphragm opening is.. Focal length is the distance in millimeters from the focal point of the image sensor to the optical center of the lens. A focal length, which results in the same field of view on a full-frame (35 mm) camera, is also provided.. Cameras of mobile devices use mainly a LED or a Xenon flash. The LED flash has a softer burst of light and in contrast to the much brighter Xenon flash, is used for recording videos as well.. One of the main characteristics of the cameras of mobile devices is their resolution, which shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the image.. Information about the maximum resolution available for shooting a video with the device.. Information about the maximum number of frames per second (fps), supported by the device while recording a video at maximum resolution. Some of the main standard frame rates for recording and playing video are 24p, 25p, 30p, 60p..

Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) review: Is it worth an e.... Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) review: Is it worth an extra $100?. The Moto G has long been the go-to phone for people on a budget. 286 Users want this. 4.00 / 5. No support for larger microSDXC storage cards. Same 5-inch display as last model. More expensive than similarly specced rivals. What does the extra money buy?. Is it any good for multimedia?. Taken with the Motorola Moto G (3rd gen). Read more: Sink or swim: The right way to use your waterproof smartphone. Taken with the Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) - flash on. Taken with the Motorola Moto G (3rd gen). What’s the deal with the hardware and battery life?. Read more: Motorola's Moto X range will go on sale at Vodafone, starting from $45 a month. The bottom line: is it worth $100 more?. There was no two ways about it: if you wanted a well rounded smartphone on a shoestring budget, you would buy a Moto G. Then you would tell your friends about its incredible value-for-money — the first and second gen models cost no more than $269. These really were the kind of smartphones that would turn the sceptical into brand advocates.. A year on and the times are changing. Google has passed Motorola on to its new owners, Lenovo, and the business is trying to increase its profitability. The result is a third generation Moto G that costs an extra $100.. The only matter left unresolved is whether the third-gen model is worth its $369 asking price.. Our only gripe with the older Moto G was its lack of 4G. This year’s model packs a 4G LTE modem than can take advantage of Australia’s fast mobile networks. More impressively, it supports fast Internet while retaining support for two SIM cards.. Armed with a Vodafone SIM in Bankstown, NSW, the Moto G recorded respective download and upload speeds of 40Mbps and 14Mbps. And just like that, the successor turns a weakness into one of its strengths.. Other changes represent a welcomed departure from the Motorola formula. Separating the Moto G from its me-too rivals is an IPX7 rating, which certifies it can be immersed in water 3 feet deep for a period of 30 minutes.. ‘Waterproofing’ a smartphone doesn’t necessarily mean it can be used underwater. Water will falsify finger touches and gestures on a capacitive smartphone screen. The IPX7 rating then reaps rewards by making it possible to hold a call when it is raining, or to handle the smartphone when hands are dripping wet. Consider it a feature of convenience.. The smartphone’s design hasn’t been sacrificed in order to make it water resistant. No flaps desecrate its ports and the overall profile remains slender. If anything, the 3rd Gen Moto G is better looking than its forefathers. Gone are the protruding speaker grilles of yesteryear; in their place are hollowed grilles that preserve the understated front. This smartphone still is inconspicuous, curvaceous and symmetrically attractive.. Up front is a familiar display. The LED-backlit LCD screen spans 5-inches, has a resolution 1280x720 and a 294 pixel-per-inch density. Failing to update the display puts the Moto G at the mercy of better equipped rivals. Its pixel density contends with ZTE’s Blade S6 and Microsoft’s Lumia 640 , but trails behind Kogan’s Agora 4G Pro and Oppo’s R7 .. A revised display would’ve served the improved cameras justice. The front camera has jumped from 2- to 5-megapixels. Whereas rivalling front cameras go too soft on detail, in a failed effort to make people’s skin appear flawless, the Moto G’s is sharp on detail and organic in its colour. It has an f/2.2 aperture and, because it has a 72-degree field of view, three or four people can squeeze into the frame. The resulting photos look fantastic on the smartphone screen and commendable on computer monitors.. Sharing the same gene-pool is the rear camera, which has jumped in size from 8- to 13-megapixels. It has an f/2.0 aperture and a dual-LED flash for improved night photography. The changes work for the most part, with daytime photos that are clear, well exposed and vibrantly coloured. Many of them will look great on a large screen television.. Artificial, low-light situations don’t do the camera any favours. The camera’s interface tries to streamline how a photo is taken by autofocusing and taking the photo in one continuous process. When light is scarce, some of the photos will be out of focus, soft on detail and riddled by image noise. The flash offers some salvation in select scenarios, such as a mid-range group shot, but falls short on most occasions.. In spite of its shortcomings, the Moto G’s cameras still surpass what’s on offer from most rivals. We consider it superior to the Lumia 640 and Kogan’s Agora 4G Pro , and a contender to the cameras in Oppo’s more expensive R7 .. Benefitting notably from upgrades is the computing hardware. The quad-core CPU runs at a faster 1.4GHz; the RAM has been doubled to 2GB and; the storage is larger at 16GB. This hardware is just enough to cover the Android 5.1 operating system, systematically processing one instruction to the next without strain, but lacking the immediacy characterising more expensive rivals.. The proof is in the numbers. A 3DMark ice storm unlimited benchmarking test returned a score of 4463, which is significantly less than the scores of Kogan’s Agora 4G Pro (7523) , ZTE’s Blade S6 (8680) and Oppo’s R7 (7775).. These numbers become a tangible hassle when gaming. Frames stutter, spoiling the fluent motion common to the rest of the operating system, and this is the case in titles as intensive as Real Racing 3 and as light as Boom Beach. Games can be played, only with less success than most of its rivals.. Another disappointment is the lack of support for microSDXC memory cards, that is, microSD cards 64GB in size and above. Rivals leave the Moto G behind by supporting larger memory cards.. Integrated into the smartphone’s enclosure is the same sized 2070 milliamp-hour battery. Its performance correlates to how light or how intensively the smartphone is used. Our testing returned results as varied as 18 hours to 29 hours, with the smartphone often averaging just shy of a full day.. Let’s not be coy: yes, this smartphone is worth the extra $100. Some rivals have better screens or support larger memory cards, but these top-tier features are pointless if they fail at the basics. And it is here, with its above-par build quality, large screen, audible speakers and fast Internet, where the Moto G excels. Only now the price hike leaves the 'Moto G' brand feeling less special.

I am from India and recently the marshmallow update was available. Now that I have my Moto G3 boot loader already unlocked, rooted and currently on 5.1.1, how should I proceed to upgrade the device to marshmallow? Would the above rooting process also work with marshmallow? Please guide. If the Marshmallow update is available, you can go ahead and get your device updated with the same.. Once the update’s done, you can do the above procedure to gain root on your device.. I read somewhere that the device needs to be unrooted prior to updating to marshmallow. Is it the case? Also there is an option to unroot in superSU itself when there is a seperate lengthier flashing guide given for unrooting moto g3 in this forum. Also would the super SU 2.46 given here work with marshmallow as few people in other forums stated its not working on it? Please reply. Would unlocking the boot loader cause OTG to stop working? I didn’t test the OTG prior to unlocking bootloader, but I recently tested it and no pen drives got detected. However, with OTG troubleshooter it displays that the chip has support but it is disabled at someplace which I am still not able to figure.. Could you please check whether OTG is working for you on G3 after unlocking bootloader / rooting? Thanks.. I’ve never heard of OTG not working after unlocking bootloader/rooting the device.. I don’t think unlocking or rooting has anything to do with the OTG system on your device, and if you think that these are the causes of the issue, please try unrooting your device and see if that solves the issue.. Let us know if that works for you.. guys please help me..whether root will work on Moto g 3rd generation marshmallow or not?. hi I have followed all these steps and rooted my phone but when I touched “reboot system” in twrp my phone has got stuck on the “WARNING BOOTLOADER UNLOCKED” screen.

Thanks for the answer, please, can you tell me how you did that? Because I am trying to turn it on on fastboot but I can’t do it. When did you get stuck at the bootloader screen? After unlocking the bootloader?. Hello, I unlocked the bootloader, then I installed TWRP, then I installed SuperSU, but when it asked me to reboot the phone, it got stucked and it’s unresponsive. Can you try flashing the following recovery on your device and then flash SuperSU and see if that works for you?. Hello i am not a native speaker but i will try to explain my problem. it is just the same as rodrigo but when i am in twrp and trying to install supersu the program says “this operation may install incompatible software and render your device unusable” this message is sent with any supersu. My antivirus is set off so that cannot be the problem.. Ignore the message and let TWRP install SuperSU on the phone. It’s completely safe to install SuperSU on your phone.. I have the same problem as Rodrigo on my Moto G 3rd Gen.. I succussfully unlocked the bootloader, loaded TWRP and then installed SuperSU-2.46 but after pressing reboot in TWRP all I get is the ‘Warning Bootloader Unlocked’ screen.. I can get back into TWRP but can not get a different result by re-installing SuperSU. I have tried twrp-osprey-2.8.7-test1.img and twrp-osprey-3.0.0-r2.img. My phone is currently looking like it is a brick! Can anyone help please?. Even if I unroot later, I think warranty has already been void because we have submitted that code. Is there any other way of rooting and which is reversible?. Yeah, you do submit your phone’s information to unlock the bootloader but how would they know you have actually used the code to unlock the bootloader? That procedure remains only on your PC.. So I don’t think you should have any issues with warranty if you unroot the device.. If you check clause number 5 in the agreement, it clear states that:-. IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE DEVICE’S BOOTLOADER IS SUBSEQUENTLY UNLOCKED OR ITS SOFTWARE OR OPERATING SYSTEM IS MODIFIED, USER AGREES TO WAIVE AND VOID ALL WARRANTIES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY MOTOROLA, BOTH EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WRITTEN WARRANTY THAT ACCOMPANIED THE DEVICE AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE OR DELIVERY, AND AGREES THAT ANY RIGHTS OR REMEDIES PROVIDED BY SUCH A WARRANTY ARE NULL AND VOID.. Have problems when I try to flash the recovery. It says “Partition Size Mismatched” and I can’t boot TWRP nor even install it. Can’t flash the phone with the SuperSu .zip file. I followed the whole procedure for root my Motorola Moto G 3rd. When I flashed my device with the TWRP file, nothing seemed to happened, I mean the recovery didn’t change at all. When I started the recovery mode pushing the power button + volume down button it says “No commands available” and doesn’t do anything. I have to push the two buttons to restart fastboot mode. Then I tried something that I saw in another video on YouTube. I did the next: instead of execute “fastboot flash recovery…”, I executed “fastboot boot recovery” and then it seemed to work and I followed the fifth part of this tutorial. NO! The white screen with the warning from the unlocked bootloader didn’t want to disappear. So I have to followed the procedure to unroot my device and all came back to zero.. When I tried to do the procedure from the Step IV, nothing works, neither the commands as fastboot flash nor even fastboot boot. The device says “Partition size mismatched (Recovery)”. Need help, please! I really want to root my Motorola 🙁. WARNING: THIS POST ISN’T FOR ANDROID 6.0, IF YOU DO IT YOU’LL GET A LOOP WITH A WHITE SCREEN AND WON’T BE ABLE TO RUN ANDROID..

After reboot device still goes direct to fastboot. How can this thing be recovered to be a phone again??. Did you attempt to do our procedure or did you do the procedure from another website? Because we have no clue what website’s instructions you followed.. First I did the same 4 major steps(Roman numerals) as in your routine. Because I did not have Super SU on my phone I used a program called CF Auto Root.. If you did the major 4 sections of our procedure, why did you not do the 5th section that taught how to flash SuperSU? You could’ve obtained SuperSU from the Downloads section of the procedure.. So, what you’re saying is that you did the steps till 4 sections and then you used CF Auto Root to root your device. I was able to use a procedure to restore the Moto G 3rd gen back to stock ROM. then tried your procedure again from the start.
