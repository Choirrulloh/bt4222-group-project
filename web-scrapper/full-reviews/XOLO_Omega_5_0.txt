more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 8 GB + MicroSD. Release date: Dec 1, 2014. View all photos (5). Too little RAM memory (1 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (294 ppi). The Xolo Omega 5.0 is a smartphone, powered by Android 4.4. Specs-wise it flaunts 5" 720p display, 1.4 GHz octa core CPU, 1 GB RAM, 8GB storage, microSD card slot, 8 MP rear camera and 2 MP one on the front. It also offers dual SIM card support.. Dimensions: 5.67 x 2.83 x 0.41 inches (144 x 72 x 10.5 mm). Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Face detection, Smile detection, Geo tagging, Voice activation. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Scenes. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 22.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 28.1 days (675 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 7.70 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 27.3 days (656 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $200 Buy. $199 Buy.

Got the Phone three days before the delivery date. Now about the phone.Now that we generally replace phones more frequently than we replace your jeans, the novelty of a new phone doesn't last that long. This phone?? It feels good in your hands. Given the price range (8051/-), I don't think there are any of""reputed" brands offer the listed features, and build quality. The finish of the phone is excellent. Glossy black finish, with the metal band across makes it look sleek. However the phone isn't the sleekest around, but the metal strip around makes it look sleek. The octa core doesn't disappoint either. Its fast, lagging and the hive UI isn't bad either. It takes time for you to get used to the UI, but then you can modify it to suit your needs. The phone does attract a lot of fingerprint, no matter how clean and dry your hands are.The phone lasts roughly around two days with a single charge, being on for 24 hrs with 2g and wifii on. But then I dont' fidget with phone every 2 mins. Special mention about the phones weight. I have been using a samsung S duos 2 earlier, compared to the Omega, the S duos feels like a shell. Seriously, if you are being attacked, just throw the damn phone at your attacker's head. I am sure it will knock him /(her) out. The weight might be a negative for some people, but for me it just heavy enough for the phone to be seated firmly on my palm. Considering the glossy finish a lighter phone would easily go for a occasional toss.. 27 Dec 2014 By MUKUND PARDESHI On flipkart.com. ORDERED THIS PRODUCT ON 15 DEC @5.29 PM AND RCVD ON 18 DEC @2 PM.

Xolo Omega 5.0 smartphone in Black. Xolo launched the Omega 5.0 , company’s latest budget smartphone with HIVE UI earlier this month at Rs. It is also one of the few budget smartphones in the price range to be powered by an Octa-Core processor. Is this one of the best budget smartphones in the price range? Let us find out in the complete review.. We unboxed the Omega 5.0 recently, check out the unboxing video below.. The 5-inch HD display with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels at 294 ppi is bright, offers vibrant color output and decent viewing angles. The sunlight legibility is good, but it is glossy and is prone to fingerprints and attracts dust easily. You can also use the bundled protection cover to protect the screen from fingerprints and scratches. Overall the display is good for the price.. The Omega 5.0 has curved design. It has huge bezels on the sides, above and below the display, so the width of the smartphone is 72mm and the height is 144mm, making it slightly wider and taller than some budget smartphones, including the 2nd gen Moto G and the Huawei Honor Holly that we reviewed recently. This doesn’t matter since the difference is just minor, and the smartphone fits in your pocket easily.. There is a 2-megapixel fixed-focus front-facing camera that can record videos at 480p VGA resolution, earpiece and the usual set of proximity and ambient light sensors above the display. This doesn’t have a LED notification light present in most budget smartphones.. It has capacitive touch buttons below the display that offer haptic feedback when pressed, but these are not backlit.. It has metal rim running on the sides. The power/lock button is present on the right side under the metal rim.. The volume rockers are present on the left side. There is a micro USB slot and a 3.5mm audio jack on the top. There is nothing on the bottom. There is a 8-megapixel auto focus camera on the back with Sony Exmor R sensor and a single LED flash below it. The plastic back cover has glossy finish that attracts fingerprints easily. You can use the bundled cover to prevent smudges.. Once you open the back cover, you can see two micro SIM slots and a microSD card slot. It has a 2100mAh built-in battery. Overall the build quality is just average.. The 8-megapixel rear camera with LED flash, Sony Exmor R sensor and f/2.0 aperture is good. Since the smartphone runs on HIVE UI, the camera has a new UI with easy toggles. It has High Dynamic Range (HDR), Low Light enhancement Object tracking, Live filters. The front camera has Face recognition, Panorama, Face beautification, Smile detection,Gesture detection, Voice Capture and ‘V’ capture. Daylight shots are good and the macro shots are brilliant. Since it has object tracking, it can focus on an object easily. It recently got an update that improves the low-light capabilities. Flash mode offers an ample amount of light so it’s not overpowering.. Check out some camera samples below (click the image to view the full resolution sample).. Check out the complete set of Xolo Omega 5.0 samples here. It can record videos at 1080p resolution at 30fps. Check out the full HD sample below.. The Xolo 8X-1000 was the first smartphone with HIVE UI that is developed. Xolo has now brought the same UI to budget Omega series. It is based on Android 4.4.2. Xolo has promised to upgrade all its smartphones running HIVE UI to Android 5.0 (Lollipop) in future. The HIVE UI has a unique user interface that gives importance to easy access and notifications right from the lock screen. You can launch the camera, messages or dialer right from the lock screen. It also shows separate notifications in the lock screen.. calendar notifications are available in the home screen too. Quick settings has unique circular adjustments for brightness and screen timeout. in HIVE UI into four – Edge, Secure, Power and Connect. The Edge app offers curated, professionally created themes, ringtones and wallpapers. The Secure app offers anti-theft features that we had seen in the form of Xolo Secure in some Xolo smartphones. The Power app is the power management app and the Connect app lets you connect with HIVE development team, collaborate with other HIVE users and co-create new ideas.. Out of 1GB of RAM, you get 952MB of usable RAM, out of which about 488MB of RAM is free when some apps are running in the background. Out of 8GB of internal storage you get about 5.74GB of user storage.. You can also set the default write disk and move compatible apps to the SD card.. Coming to apps, the Omega 5.0 comes pre-loaded with several set of apps. Apart from the usual set of utility apps and Google apps, it comes with Dropbox, Facebook, Google Keep and Vodafone Music.. The Music Player and FM Radio have new interface since this has HIVE UI. The default FusionX music player has support for different skins. It has Yamaha Stereo power amplifier, but the loudspeaker output is just average, and audio through the bundled earphones or other third-party earphones are. not loud even when the volume is full and audio enhancer is enabled. The FM Radio has auto search and audio recording. It can play 1080p full HD videos smoothly.. Both the SIM cards support 3G, but you can enable 3G on only one SIM, while the other is on 2G. The connectivity features include, 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.0 with A2DP and GPS. It doesn’t have USB on-the-go (OTG) support.. It is powered by a Octa-Core MediaTek MT6592M processor with 8 ARM Cortex-A7 CPUs clocked at 1.36 GHz per core. The performance is smooth without any lags. Thanks to 1GB RAM the multitasking was smooth, but the HIVE UI occupies more RAM at times. Check out synthetic benchmark scores below.. It scored 11710 points in the Quadrant benchmark.. In the AnTuTu benchmark 4, the Xolo Omega 5.0 scored 20895 points.. It scored 27093 points in AnTuTu Benchmark 5.. It topped the Vellamo 2 HTML5 browser benchmark by clocking 2341 points. Check out the complete set of Xolo Omega 5.0 benchmarks here .. It has a Mali 450-MP4 GPU. It doesn’t support USB or PS3 controllers. Overall it scored 3.5/5 stars in our gaming review.. Coming to the battery life, the 2100 battery is just average. It lasts for less than a day with mixed use, including 3G usage, video playback, few hours of music, few calls and some gaming with both the SIM cards enabled. If you are a heavy user, you can use the CPU power saving mode and enable Xolo Power to extend the battery life.. In our battery test, the Omega 5.0 achieved One Charge rating of 11 hours and 21 minutes, mainly due to its talk time, otherwise the battery life is not impressive considering Xolo’s recent Q2100 smartphone with a 2800mAh battery that offered brilliant battery life. You can check out the complete Xolo Omega 5.0 battery test results here .. At a price tag of Rs. 8,999, the Xolo Omega 5.0 is a decent budget smartphone. Even though it is priced slightly on the higher side compared to its competitors, the octa-core processor offers better performance than its competitors that justifies the price tag. The design and the build quality could have been better and the audio quality could be improved, otherwise this is definitely a good contender in the price range. Xolo also has the Omega 5.5 smartphone with better specifications that includes a 13MP rear camera and 2600mAh battery. You can check that out too if you are looking for a large-screen budget smartphone under Rs. Srivatsan Sridhar is a Mobile Technology Enthusiast who is passionate about Mobile phones and Mobile apps.

Xolo Omega 5.0: The Best Bang for your Bucks!. Xolo has finally come up with the Omega series Smartphones which will be shortly made available at the domestic markets. The company seems to have put in a lot of innovation into the way the Omega handsets have been grafted especially to suit the budget market but this time with a hint of class and panache. The prices are out and the Omega 5.0 looks to be in line with the myriad user requirements while putting up with the multiple feature sets which are pretty bankable as well.. Pros: The design looks quite perfect as Xolo has taken the aesthetics pretty seriously this time over. The processor seems to be pretty fast whereas the inclusion of a brand new UI looks like a serious step forward. Screen size is pretty respectable whereas the resolution offered is quite high than most of the similarly priced handsets.. Cons: In comes the RAM allotment which could have been a bit higher while we weren’t quite elated about the internal memory. Camera allotment is not bad but certainly cannot be considered as the best possible option rendered out from the company.. Here is how the review on the Omega 5.0 pans out as we look into each and every spec associated with the gadget in full detail.. The recent Omega 5.0 looks like a slim gadget with the exact thickness level being in the range of 10.5mm. The best part however has to be the inclusion of all the physical buttons across the surface without adding to the clutter. The offered surface is pretty classy and the gadget comes in with the curved panel which is well backed up by the curvier and rounded edges. This actually improves the overall grip whereas the gadget quite surprisingly looks to include the metallic rims lingering on the sides. If this holds true as per the images then Xolo would be achieving something elusive which is in sync with the myriad aesthetic requirements.. The Omega 5.0 features a sizeable screen at 5 inches which is well rounded up by the HD resolution which sits pretty over the surface. The console is backed up by 720p panel which is still pretty vibrant. Adding to the offered resolution is the IPS panel which is certainly a great inclusion at the given price range. While this takes care of all the viewing angles with precision the gadget in Omega 5.0 will be able to boast of better color reproduction strategies with over 16M combinations t vouch for. The pixel density isn’t the highest but still pretty manageable at 294ppi.. This handset will be backed up by the latest OS version pertaining to android. The offered KitKat v4.4 is to be supported which will be backed up by the proprietary Hive UI as offered by the company. Similar to the KitKat this UI has certain attributes added along in the form of some visual tweaks and the newest form of the launcher. One might also expect multiple ringtones and wallpapers to be added into the mix which does make the gadget look like a holistic option in terms of utility. One might also look at the special store in Edge which sits over the UI in the form of an app. Enhancement updates have been promised by the company concerning the UI which combines many applications in the best possible manner while adding some newer widget to fit in with the entire layout.. The Omega 5.0 comes in with the MediaTek chipset of the make MT6592M. The offered processor thus isn’t quad-core anymore as Xolo upgrades itself to the elusive Octa-Core with the clock speed being in the range of 1.4GHz. This processor is pretty well equipped in handling multiple tasks with ease whereas the gaming performances are well taken care of by the gadget.. The storage regime is pretty basic with the Omega 5.0 offering 1GB of RAM in addition to the 8GB of internal memory. This is certainly a better allotment in terms of firepower which can be further extended up to a sizeable 32GB on adding the needed micro-SD card .. The camera allotment is pretty straightforward as well with the 8MP unit at the rear. This comes in with the LED flashlight and the f/2.0 wide angle lens does pack in a lot in terms of innovation. The Exmor R sensor is what is supported whereas the secondary module comes good at 2MP. Full HD recording support is also offered by the rear camera which is certainly something to look forward to.. Multiple connectivity features are supported by this gadget in the form of 3G, Bluetooth and much more but the battery support doesn’t look synonymous to the same. At 2100mAh the Omega 5.0 is certainly not a great gadget which would last a whopping 2 days but something which has to be charged pretty often. The details haven’t been revealed as for yet as for the talk-time support but we aren’t pretty hopeful regarding the same.. Amidst the uncertainties, the Omega 5.0 from Xolo comes in as one gadget which is pretty exciting in terms of usage and aesthetics. Be it the trendy design or the better display, this gadget has a lot of potential besides multiple connectivity options to bank upon. The battery still remains to be a constraint but we expect the company to include a power saving mode here and there to match up to the international standards..

XOLO off late has added some rather interesting products to its catalogue in the overflowing lower mid-range category of smartphones. The company recently launched the Play series, along with adding a Windows Phone to its product catalog.. now added a pair of sub Rs. 10,000 devices under the new XOLO Omega range, the XOLO Omega 5.0 and the Omega 5.5. Given the price, they offer a fairly solid set of specifications. Omega range take on the likes of Xiaomi, who have notably made a dent in the market with their aggressive pricing. It’s all about flagship killers these days, though can XOLO have a Xiaomi-killer in the making?. The one with us is the Omega 5.0 which is the smaller of the two, with main differences primarily being screen size, camera resolution and battery capacity. The XOLO Omega 5.0 packs in a decent set of specs, but with the competition in budget category booming, can the smartphone leave its mark in the market, let’s find out!. As already mentioned, the XOLO Omega 5.0 does come with a fairly decent set of specs. Notably, it comes quite close to the Xiaomi Redmi Note.. Check out the key specs below:. At first glance, the XOLO Omega 5.0 looks like a well-made smartphone, though nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to design. It has a pretty bland look, with a black plastic finishing coupled with a metallic silver trim running along the edges. We have the power and the volume rocker keys housed within these metallic strips, with the power button on the right and the volume rockers on the left.. The bottom of the device is empty as both the micro-USB port and 3.5 mm headset jacks are housed on top. Meanwhile, the three capacitive physical buttons are located below the display, which are not backlit but would suffice in low light conditions as the icons are shiny enough.. The back of the phone is made out of a smooth glossy plastic, apparently making it a fingerprint magnet. The primary camera unit is housed at the back with the XOLO logo housed right below the camera unit. The rear speaker cutout is made almost at the bottom.. Removing the back panel is relatively easy, which reveals the two SIM card slots along with the microSD slots, though you cannot mess around with the battery unit.. All in all, the Omega 5.0 is quite convenient for one-handed usage. The curved back does enhance the overall grip on the phone, though lacks the looks which forms one of the perennial elements of a smartphone.. The XOLO Omega 5.0 runs on the Android 4.4 KitKat OS with XOLO’s proprietary UI Hive on top. The HIVE UI has more of a streamlined and minimalistic approach to the stock Android, making it perfectly in tune with Google’s new material design.. The first thing we noticed was the lock screen, which has quite an interesting take on jumping onto specific apps directly from the lock screen. It allows users to jump directly into the most used apps directly, which is quite a nifty feature. The second major difference being how all apps are housed; they are arranged chronologically in three different ways – alphabetical, recently used and categorically.. Along with that there are a few interesting. For instance, the contacts application now features block colours and rounded icons; an. In addition, the toggle menu has been given a new look as brightness and volume options now get a jog-dial system of adjusting them. Unlike the line bar style found in almost all other UI’s. In addition, there are some nifty power saving modes and CPU information which seems rather useful.. Overall, the UI appears rather pleasing and is. minimalistic; HIVE certainly has the potential around which future smartphones’ user interface will be based on. One of the snappier and user-friendly interfaces’. we’ve come across in a long time.. The smartphone features a 5-inch screen with a pixel resolution of 1280x720p, which has a pixel density of 294ppi. Hence, it makes for great readability with larger and broader texts. Even viewing angles are fairly good, presence of an IPS on-board panel is clearly evident.. Meanwhile, the multimedia capabilities of the phone are quite satisfactory. It supports all video formats, though HD videos were experiencing a few hiccups. That being said; the audio quality of the phone does pack some punch, with almost minimal distortion. Overall, the phone’s multimedia capabilities are fairly satisfactory given the price of the device.. The XOLO Omega 5.0 sports an 8MP AF primary camera with Exmor R sensor along with a 2MP front-facing camera. The primary camera unit can take fairly good quality pictures with good detailing and colour reproduction. Daylight images are rather more than satisfactory though one might have trouble at night. Meanwhile, the camera app comes preloaded with an array of. shooting modes including HDR, Panorama, Gesture Shot to name a few. Also included in the camera widget are some preloaded effects like Mono, Sepia, Aqua, Blackboard etc.. Overall, the camera performance is rather pleasing, especially when taking macro shots. The rear camera is also able to take Full HD videos at 30 fps, and the video recording quality is fairly decent given the price range. While the front snapper isn’t all that amazing, but it. With an octa-core chipset bundled with 1 GB of RAM, the XOLO Omega 5.0 fared some impressive benchmark scores in our benchmark suite of tests. Interestingly, the Omega 5.0 has a slight edge over the newly launched Xiaomi Redmi Note when it comes to benchmark scores. The Omega 5.0 scooped up 27,290 in Antutu, 11,727 in Quadrant Standard, and a score of 59.1 FPS in Nena Mark. We were pretty much taken aback seeing the Omega 5.0 having the lead over the Redmi Note in our benchmark scores.. The scores indeed translate into its real-time performance as it can handle multitasking and normal daily usage without any hassles. Popular gaming titles like Subway Surfer and Temple Run run flawlessly though one might experience a few lags on cranked up settings playing high-end titles like Asphalt. However, it’s still a delightful experience and those slight hiccups do not alter the overall experience of the game.. The phone’s signal quality is rather good indoors as well as outdoors, while audio on call is pretty crisp and clear on incoming as well as outgoing calls. Meanwhile, Wi-Fi connectivity is quite strong, it detects and latches onto networks within range at ease, thanks to the plastic body which significantly improves Wi-Fi connectivity.. Meanwhile, battery life should suffice for one whole day of usage with the included 2100mAh battery, which is quite standard in this price bracket. Even for a heavy user, the battery should make it through the day without the need for constant charging.. Given the price, the XOLO Omega 5.0 is a rather solid entry level performer and at the same time is easily available. While it might not appear at par with the competition in terms of its outer demeanor, it overthrows that by what it has on its inside. With an octa-core chipset and 1 GB of RAM, along with a fairly impressive 8 MP camera, it does what you would demand from a smartphone, that too at relatively attractive price point. In addition, the company has also promised the Lollipop update.. XOLO Omega 5.0 is a step in the right direction for domestic manufacturers, especially when companies like Xiaomi and Motorola are constantly giving them a hard time.. Put simply, the XOLO Omega 5.0 is a great buy, though you have other options like the Redmi Note and the Omega 5.5, if you’re willing to sacrifice a bit on portability.. shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter. iGyaan Network's Newbie, Abhinav Loves Gaming, Cars and Technology, You can Find Him on PSN Bragging About his FIFA Skills..
