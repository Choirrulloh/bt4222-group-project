LG V30 is an Android phablet manufactured by LG Electronics. It was unveiled on 31 August 2017, as the successor to the LG V20. It ditches the secondary display introduced by the V10 for a "floating bar" which has nearly the same functions as the second display. It still features quad DACs for improved audio. The phone was first teased on 3 August 2017, in a press release from LG, showing the bottom half of the FullVision display. [3] On August 7, press invitations were sent out featuring the words "Lights. [4] Video teasers were later released, advertising the phone's display, audio and camera capabilities. The LG V30 features a 6.0-inch P-OLED FullVision Display, with an 18:9 aspect ratio, manufactured by LG Display. Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, coupled with 4. GB of internal storage, while the V30+ has 128. GB, which is expandable via microSD card. [8] This is also the first LG smartphone to feature an OLED display.. The LG V30 has a dual-lens camera setup, like most smartphones released in 2017, with a 16- megapixel main sensor, with a 71° field of view, and a 13-megapixel wide angle sensor, with a 120° field of view. However, the main camera also features a wider-than-usual f/1.6 aperture and a 10-bit HDR sensor (both a first in the world of smartphone cameras). [ citation needed ] The 10-bit HDR image sensor is capable of capturing nearly 1,070,000,000 different colors, which is about 211% more colors [9] than an 8-bit image sensor. The main sensor has optical image stabilization , which corrects motion blur in photos and videos, but there is no OIS on the wide angle lens.. The V30 ships with Android 7.1.2 "Nougat" with LG's custom skin, LG UX .. While the V30's screen has been criticized by some for its relative lack of color saturation, it has received praise for having one of the most mature dual-camera systems available. [10] Construction of the V30 consists of a Gorilla Glass 5 front and rear plate sandwiching an aluminum body.. LG has also been praised for their commitment to audio quality, retaining the headphone jack even as other premium smartphones have removed it, [11] and including multiple audio sensors for input and a 32-bit Quad-DAC (Digital Analog Converter) for output. The phone has been criticized for the huge amount of bloatware LG puts on carrier branded devices. ^ "LG V30 - Full phone specifications". Archived from the original on 4 January 2018.

Applies too much noise reduction in low-light photos. LG's big-screen V30 lets you roam farther and capture wider images than other smartphones.. The LG V30 (available on all five major US carriers for around $800, as well as unlocked) is the best phone for a big world. It has a wide-angle camera for when you have a large family or too many friends to crowd into a standard photo. And it allows you to go farther afield on T-Mobile than any other phone, thanks to support for the carrier's new Band 71, 600MHz network. The V30 is a big step forward for LG, and comes close to unseating the Samsung Galaxy S8 as our Editors' Choice, but is ultimately held back by a few little things.. Design-wise, the V30 goes for the curved glass that's been so popular on the Galaxy S8. Unlike the LG G6 , which has a flat front with a metal frame around it, the glass here protrudes like it does on other phones. The V20 's removable back and battery are, alas, gone. Instead, the phone has a shiny, IP68 waterproof metal unibody, with a clear plastic coating over the silver back. It meets the MIL-STD -810G spec for resistance to shock, vibration, extreme temperatures, and a range of other conditions.. At 5.96 by 2.96 by 0.29 inches (HWD), the phone is shorter, but a little wider, than the Galaxy S8+ ( 6.28 by 2.89 by 0.32 inches). Its 6-inch, 2,880-by-1,440, 2:1 screen is comparable with other big phones. Using SQUID , an aspect ratio-neutral measurement of area, the V30 has 14.4 square inches of display, while the iPhone 8 Plus has 12.9, the LG G6 has 13.0, and the Galaxy Note 8 has 15.6.. To my eye, Samsung's phones look more striking, in part because of their rounded sides. The V30's metal band makes it look a little more conventional. At 5.57 ounces, though, it's lighter than the S8+ (6.10 ounces) or Note 8 (6.88 ounces).. The screen is OLED, with the vibrant colors and perfect blacks that come along with the technology. Brightness is similar to a Galaxy S8 when set side by side, but it falls far short of the blazing Note 8; the difference is especially visible at night.. One way the V30 is superior to the Samsungs, though, is in the placement of its fingerprint sensor. In traditional LG fashion, the fingerprint sensor is also the power button, and while it's on the back of the phone, it's far enough down that you don't have to worry about getting fingerprints on the camera the way you do on the S8 and the Note 8.. View All 20 Photos in Gallery. There's a USB-C port on the bottom, a standard headphone jack on the top, and a microSD card slot tucked in with the SIM slot. The phone has wireless charging, and in fact worked with a Samsung wireless charging pad I had on hand.. Call quality, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and LTE on the V30 are all excellent. The earpiece gets nice and loud, and the bottom-ported speaker startled me with its clarity. Transmissions when sent from noisy areas successfully blanked out most background noise without making my voice sound robotic.. The V30 pulled out slightly better 5GHz Wi-Fi range than the Galaxy Note 8, and Bluetooth 5.0 lets it pair to multiple speakers or sets of headphones at once. Folks in hurricane-prone areas will be happy to see that unlike Apple's iPhones, the V30 has an FM radio as well.. This is a gigabit LTE phone on AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, joining the S8, Note 8, and Moto Z2 Force. Speeds in a dense urban area were on par with the S8.. It's unique on T-Mobile as the first phone to support the carrier's new 600MHz, Band 71 network , which will enhance the carrier's rural coverage as it gets built out over the next few years. While more Band 71 phones will come next year, right now this is the only official option if you want that extended future coverage.. LG makes a big deal about its Hi-Fi Quad DAC (digital-to-analog converter), but listening to several tracks on expensive Bowers & Wilkins P7 wired headphones with it turned on and off, I couldn't tell the difference. Part of the issue here is that audio quality through the Snapdragon 835 chipset is pretty good already.. The basic specs and performance here are pretty standard for a 2017 flagship phone. The V30 packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of base internal storage (49GB available), and all of the usual bells and whistles. I ran our usual benchmarks, and they were on par with the similarly equipped Essential Phone .. The V30 runs Android 7.1.2, not Android 8.0 Oreo , although an Oreo update will come. LG's default setting eliminates the app drawer for a more Apple-like home-screen-only approach, although you can bring it back. The company's response to Samsung's Edge functionality is the much less compelling "floating bar," a software option that pops out from the side of the screen with app shortcuts, music player controls, or quick contacts. You can turn that off, too, if you want. The V20's "secondary screen" feature, perpetually at the top of the display and not overwriting the content you are looking at, was more useful.. We only got 4 hours, 46 minutes of LTE streaming (full-screen video at maximum brightness) on one battery charge, much shorter than with competing phones. The Galaxy S8, for instance, lasts 5 hours and 45 minutes, and we consider that to be merely average. Most new phones will get you around 7 or 8 hours.. LG talks up the V30's dual-camera design in its marketing material, hyping the main f/1.6 wide-angle lens and its f/1.9 ultra-wide rear companion. The front-facing, 5MP selfie camera is also wider than your typical camera phone .. Do the rear cameras live up to the hype? Well, yes and no. Let's talk about the dual-camera approach first. Samsung and Apple have dual lenses on the Note 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. There's the standard wide lens, the same type you'll find on just about every smartphone, and a second lens with a narrower angle of view. The second lens nabs shots of more distant subjects, and also works in conjunction with the main imager to blur the background behind subjects.. The V30's second lens is wider than wide. Its 120-degree field of view puts it in the same territory as a 14mm lens on a full-frame camera. The extra coverage doesn't come without some trade-offs. First, the wide camera is fixed focus, so it's only good for subjects a few feet or beyond from the phone—we weren't able to run our standard resolution test on the lens because framing our test chart properly put it too close to the lens for it to be in focus. Second, you get some curved barrel distortion, about 3.3 percent. You can see the straight lines of buildings bulging out unnaturally.. Since I couldn't generate resolution numbers to compare with other phones, I eyeballed some test images shot with the ultra-wide lens. They definitely don't pick up as much detail as images shot with the main lens (or other phones), but for what it is, it's not bad. Details are fairly strong in the center of the image—I can make out details in the brickwork. But you'll want to keep your subjects mostly in the center of the frame—for one, it minimizes the effects of the distortion. More importantly, details give way to a heavy blur as you move away from the center and toward the edges and corners of the frame.. But you probably don't care too much about absolute resolution and corner quality when you need to get that wide, wide image. If you're part of a big crowd at a concert or sporting event you can snap images that put the viewer right there with you, and you can use it to capture wide action scenes that your typical smartphone sweep-to-panorama function just can't get. Sure, there's the modest fish-eye look, but it's the trade-off you make to get the big picture with a device that slides into your pocket.. The wide lens sets the V30 apart from the Note 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. Which dual-lens approach is better for you? Get the Note 8 if you photograph concerts or people from a distance, or if you love shooting subjects with a blurred background. The 2x lens (roughly 50mm in full-frame terms) does both. Go with the V30 if crave an ultra-wide field of view, similar to what you get with a GoPro. It's a solid choice for really wide landscapes and photographing groups of people in very tight spaces.. Now for the main lens, which LG is billing for its low-light capabilities above all. The 4.03mm f/1.6 lens is backed by a 16MP image sensor. LG doesn't list the sensor size in its specifications, but based on EXIF data and the angle of view, it's in the same ballpark as the main image sensor on the iPhone 8 Plus, and covers a similar 28mm angle of view.. At low ISO settings the main camera does a fine job resolving detail. It scores 2,356 lines on our standard sharpness test. That's less than the iPhone 8 (2,851 lines) and Note 8 (3,025 lines), but you can't make a direct comparison between the scores because the V30 has a higher-density 16MP sensor, versus the 12MP chips used by the competition. In reality, the V30's extra sensor resolution gives it a slight advantage in resolving tiny details in bright light. But it's not something you're going to notice when viewing images on a screen unless you magnify photos to 100 or 200 percent. In bright light, all of the modern flagship phones we've tested deliver strong results.. We've found that scene recognition, exposure, and the other decisions a smartphone camera makes to capture an image are more important than specifications when it comes to more difficult situations. For a phone that's typically dim lighting. LG advertises its f/1.6 lens as being a low-light monster. But let's be real here—f/1.6 is not that much different than the f/1.7 you get on the Note 8 or the f/1.8 you get with an iPhone 8, especially when you consider the extremely small sensor and lens size we're dealing with. Those numbers mean more when talking about full-frame systems with longer lenses.. The V30's low-light image quality is frustrating, especially when you compare it with the Note 8, shot side-by-side under the same conditions. Take a look at the crop from a nighttime snapshot to the right. The top image was captured with the V30, the bottom with the Note 8. The V30 didn't record the ISO used in its EXIF data for some reason, but did record that the shutter speed was 1/13-second, but the Note 8 shot was captured at ISO 1000 and 1/10-second shutter speed, so we expect the ISO to be in the same ballpark.. Despite our model appearing smaller in the Note 8 crop (an effect of the difference in resolution), you see more detail in her face. Her eyes are visible, her hair color is truer to reality, and there's some color in her cheeks. The V30 is applying some pretty heavy noise reduction here, blurring away all detail, and at the same time applying some garish sharpening that adds weird artifacts, especially visible on our model's nose and eyes. Both cameras have optical image stabilization, which helps to make a shot like this possible in the first place, but it's not a panacea. You'll need your subject to stand still for a stabilized shot.. Our studio lab tests confirm that the V30's high ISO image quality is way behind what you get with the Note 8. I shot our standard ISO test scene at each full-stop setting from ISO 50 through ISO 3200. The JPG output is at its best at lower settings, which is to be expected. At ISO 400 we start to see some odd pixelation in the fine details of our test scene. Most cameras would simply blur these, but it looks like the V30 is trying to pull out some detail that just isn't there. At ISO 800 the problem is exacerbated. Our test image is a mix of noise, blur, and oddly garbled details. Strangely enough, at ISO 1600 and 3200 we see high ISO results that look more like they should— there's rough grain and lack of detail, sure, but it looks right.. Raw results, processed in Adobe Lightroom CC with default develop settings applied appear softer than the V30's JPG output. That's typical for a small-sensor camera, smartphone or not. But they don't show the ugly looking details we get with the ISO 400 and 800 JPG output. So you can skirt some issues by opting for Raw capture. But you need to develop Raw shots to make them useable—not everyone has the skill or desire to shoot Raw format.. That also means that there's a chance that LG could update the V30 to better handle JPG output in this ISO range. But the inherent sin here, using a 16MP sensor instead of a 12MP, can't be overcome with a software fix. In the meantime, we continue to recommend the Note 8 for Android fans (and iPhone 8 Plus for Apple devotees) who want the best performance from a smartphone camera in all kinds of light.. Despite not having stabilization, the ultra-wide camera is a lot of fun to play with in video mode, because you can swap between the standard and wide-angle lenses on demand: for instance, starting out by looking at an entire playing field in fish-eye, and then going tight on a few players. Video recording is absolutely gorgeous, both in regular and wide-screen modes. Its 120-degree field of view minimizes jitters, and when you switch to the main camera for video you'll enjoy the benefits of optical stabilization. My videos looked smooth with both lenses.. The V30 records 4K video at 30 frames per second, with 1080p video going to 60 frames per second. That's similar to the Galaxy Note 8. There are some cool software tricks you can do: "point zoom" causes the camera to slowly zoom in on a specific part of your image, for instance. You do have to make sure to hold the phone the right way, though: there are stereo mics on the top and bottom, and if you cover one with your hand, recordings will be muffled.. LG's V30 is a phone for a wide, wide world. As the first Band 71 phone, it's the one T-Mobile subscribers who aren't thrilled with their current coverage should grab. As a wide-angle camera phone, it's one that anyone with a big family or a wild group of friends will adore.. Gigabit LTE and a faster processor makes the V30 a significantly better pick than the G6, and the wide-angle camera is something you won't find in either Samsung's Galaxy line or Google's Pixel 2 .. The V30's battery life and LG's aggressive approach to sharpening low-light photos leaves us a little frustrated, though. While the V30 has the specs for terrific camera performance, LG's software leads to low-light photos consistently not coming out quite as clear as photos taken with the Galaxy Note 8 and S8. That leaves the Galaxy S8 as our all-around Editors' Choice, although the V30 is worth strong consideration if the new T-Mobile coverage or wide-angle camera options appeal to you..

CNET también está disponible en español.. A fantastic phone that nearly does it all. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The LG V30 almost has it all: a great camera, speedy processor, huge OLED screen, excellent battery life, waterproofing, wireless charging, microSD storage and the best headphone jack on a phone.. The Bad Ergonomic quirks can make the V30 awkward to hold. You may miss some shots due to slow camera autofocus. Carrier-specific versions come with annoying bloatware and logos.. The Bottom Line The LG V30 is a rock-solid alternative to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Plus and the Google Pixel 2 XL. If it fits your hands and your photographic needs, you won't be disappointed.. What's an LG V30 and how much does it cost?. I just want a phone that does everything. Is that too much to ask?. I want a sleek, durable handset that's practically all screen. A device with gobs of performance, loooong battery life, an amazing camera and a headphone jack. How about water resistance, wireless charging, microSD expandable storage and support for any cellular carrier, too?. Until recently, Samsung was the only company that offered such a product -- like the Galaxy S8 , S8 Plus and Note. Now, there's the LG V30 as well. It isn't a cheap phone, it isn't a. small phone and it isn't perfect. I've used it for a whole month as my daily driver, and I definitely have annoyances to share.. But here's what the V30 truly is: a worthy rival for Samsung.. In test after test against Samsung's similar Galaxy S8 Plus , the V30 held its own -- to the point that you might be happy buying it instead.. It's LG's new flagship phone -- a solid step up in build quality and features from the LG G6 released earlier this year.. With a new OLED screen, thinner build, improved dual cameras and a quad-DAC (digital-to-analog audio converter) built into the headphone jack, LG's marketing it as both a luxury phone and a content creator's dream, with particular focus on videographers (who can shoot pro-style Log format video) and audiophiles.. In the US, the 64GB phone costs between $810 and $840 depending on cellular carrier, with an unlocked version compatible with all four major US carriers retailing for $830.. Sprint is the exception: It sells an upgraded V30+ with double the storage (128GB) and a pair of B&O wired headphones for $912.. I must have heard that question half a dozen times while using the V30, and there's good reason. Like the iPhone X and many other 2017 flagship handsets, the 6-inch LG V30 is a vision made of glass and aluminum.. It, too, has an unusually tall screen that extends practically all the way to the top and bottom edges. It, too, sports a smooth glass back and a shiny aluminum band. And it, too, houses a P-OLED display -- the first on an LG phone in quite a while.. The OLED screen really pops, even if LG's display is somewhat inferior to Samsung.. Why are OLED screens so sought after? Each pixel emits its own light, allowing for more vibrant colors and deeper blacks. And I'm happy to report that LG's 6-inch, 2,880x1,440-pixel screen is crisp and beautiful right out of the box.. The LG V30 does fit in pants pockets. How much it will bulge depends on your pants.. (As we've discovered in recent weeks, not all OLEDs are created equal , and some worried that the LG V30's 6-inch screen -- built by LG -- might demonstrate the same ghostly afterimages and muted colors as the LG-built 6-inch screen in the Pixel 2 XL. Thankfully, that doesn't seem to be the case with ours.). That said, the V30's screen isn't quite the best OLED has to offer. It didn't get as bright or clear as Samsung's screen outdoors -- which honestly made taking photos and video a little difficult. It looks a bit blue when viewed from off-angles, even if the color shift isn't quite as noticeable as Google's Pixel 2 XL.. The V30's screen has some odd issues at low brightness, too: I had a hard time watching Netflix and browsing websites in bed because LG's screen tends to crush blacks when the screen's brightness is set low. Dim scenes in movies didn't just look dim, but positively deathly. Just something to be aware of.. More importantly, I had a few issues holding the phone that surrounds that giant screen.. While I absolutely adore the V30's rear-mounted power button (which doubles as a responsive fingerprint sensor, and triples as a divot that helps me balance the phone), the phone is still so wide, it was hard to grip with a single, medium-size hand. The glass and metal surfaces are smooth enough that it's easy for the phone to slip.. Also, the rough edges of the USB-C cutout tend to dig into my finger, which made my "pinkie shelf hold" problematic. Plus, there lots of times when, trying to grip the phone tightly, my meaty fingers would occasionally brush the edge of the screen, and the display would unknowingly sense two fingers and failed to carry out a tap.. Don't get me wrong, the V30 looks and feels lovely (save the big AT&T logo on the back of my review unit) and the fingerprint sensor placement is way better than the camera smudge magnet on Samsung's Galaxy S8 and Note 8. I just don't think the ergonomics are universally great.. If you're coming from a previous LG V-series phone , know you'll no longer find the second tiny screen that used to live on top of the display. But you can get most of the same quick-launch shortcuts by turning on the new Floating Bar in settings. Then, simply swipe in from the screen's edge to capture a region of your screen, create animated GIFs and more.. Let's make one thing clear: The LG V30's dual cameras take killer photos. They're crisp, full of life, and -- as often as not -- better than ones I took side by side with a Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus , with more detail and less splotchy noise if you zoom in. You can thank the additional megapixels (16MP vs. 12MP) and slightly larger lens aperture (f/1.6 vs. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

The V30 is LG’s latest flagship device and it offers a whole load of features that wouldn’t find anywhere else.. It’s a great phone, but one that appears to have lost some of its lustre as a result of the delayed release. Currently on the market are the Huawei Mate 10 Pro , Pixel 2 XL and iPhone X , all of which are muscling in on the V30’s territory.. The V30 is the best designed LG phone I’ve ever used. It’s the perfect mix of high-end metal and glass, sporting curves in all the right places. It spells the end in LG’s transformation from making unattractive devices – the leather LG G4, anyone? – to ones that are gimmick-free.. Order LG V30 from Carphone Warehouse for £799. Like all the best flagships in 2017, the V30 slims down the bezel surrounding the display and pushes that screen out as far as possible. The corners of the screen are rounded, but the display doesn’t curve in the way of the Samsung Galaxy S8. This means the device is a tad wider, but still surprisingly manageable to grip considering the 6-inch screen.. The LG V30 feels great in the hand, but unnervingly light. I’m sure that there will be many that like this, but I’m not so sure; I like my phones to have a little heft. Tap the rear of the V30 and it feels hollow, something you don’t get with an iPhone 8 or Note 8.. However, in terms of the LG V30’s design, this is really the only negative in my opinion. Elsewhere, it’s IP67-rated for water-resistance; it retains the headphone jack; and its fingerprint scanner sits in the right place – below the cameras on the back. That scanner also doubles as the lock button – and it’s one of the fastest I’ve tried.. This is the first LG flagship to swap an LCD panel for an OLED one since the days of those weird Flex phones. LG makes some of the best OLED panels for TVs, so you’d assume its smaller versions would be equally as good.. The screen isn’t terrible, but it’s comfortably the weakest part of the phone.. Detail isn’t the issue: the quad-HD resolution ensures pixels are impossible to spot. However, colours often come across slightly off. Whites are muddy, and it’s virtually impossible to watch HDR/Dolby Vision content on Netflix because it’s far too dark.. Viewing angles, too, are poor – tilt the device to the side and you’ll be met with a blue tinge.. Use the LG V30 and you’ll quickly realise that we’ve been spoiled by the Super AMOLEDs in Samsung devices. LG’s OLEDs, called POLED (that P is for plastic), just aren’t as good. It’s the same panel type that let the Pixel 2 XL down. People often conclude that OLED is always better than an LCD, but viewing the V30’s display, I’d have been happier with the iPhone 8 Plus’ screen –.

As a result, the V30 has an 18:9 aspect-ratio as opposed to the typical 16:9.. The panel is taller, which means it’s great for reading and multitasking, but less so for video. In YouTube, for example, there will be chunky black bars sitting either side of the video.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

Screen and camera don't quite measure up to Galaxy Note 8. With tons of storage and powerful music capabilities, the LG V30+ is the ultimate phone for audiophiles, and one of only two phones capable of reaching the fastest speeds on Sprint.. The LG V30+ ($912 at Sprint; $929 unlocked) is an even better phone to capture the entire world and listen to large, high-quality music files than the standard LG V30. The V30+ is really just a V30 with 128GB of storage and a pair of pretty good earphones included in the box, for about $100 more than the 64GB V30. It's the only version of the V30 available for Sprint, though, and its 4x4 MIMO antennas give it extra powers on the carrier's network. We found spectacular download speeds in testing, and 4x4 MIMO is sure to improve signal strength. That makes the V30+ a special pick for Sprint users who want the best wireless speeds.. For almost everything about the LG V30+, take a look at our LG V30 review. The V30+ looks the same and feels the same. The difference is in the storage, the modem frequency bands, and the included earbuds. We also tested the battery separately: at 8 hours, 29 minutes of LTE streaming, it did very well.. The phone still has a microSD card slot, and if you're really crazy you can put in the new SanDisk Ultra 400GB microSD card, for over 500GB of usable space. I think this most matters in association with the V30+'s Hi-Fi Quad DAC, a more powerful than usual digital-to-analog converter that can drive big, audiophile -level headphones .. People who care about DACs often listen to lossless audio files, which can be very large. A five-minute, 192/24 FLAC file can be up to 200MB , as compared with around 11MB for a 320kbps MP3 of the same length. The result is that audiophiles love having copious amounts of storage. Getting to 500GB, in a phone that can drive high-impedance headphones, can make a real difference if you have a large, local library of big files.. View All 6 Photos in Gallery. The V30+ also includes LG QuadPlay earbuds, which are supposedly tuned to take advantage of the phone's special DAC. The V30 doesn't come with any earbuds at all. It's a nice convenience, though I imagine true audiophiles will already have a favorite pair of their own.. The Sprint model of the V30+ is one of only two phones the carrier sells with 4x4 MIMO; the other one is the Moto Z2. As the V30+ has both waterproofing and a headphone jack, it's probably the more mainstream choice of the two.. 4x4 MIMO doubles the antenna branches used in the phone to double the potential bandwidth on each network channel. With Sprint, it's used primarily to speed up downloads. It also tends to improve signal strength in general.. When we took the V30+ out in Manhattan, we got speeds we've never seen before on a Sprint phone. Comparing it with a ZTE Warp Connect hotspot, which has an older, slower modem, we saw peaks of 133Mbps down where the Warp Connect only made it to 32Mbps. That wasn't a fluke, either —in other locations the phone got 105Mbps and 125Mbps where the hotspot got 21Mbps and 41Mbps.. Other top phones, like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8, will perform better than the hotspot did. They have better modems, although they still lack 4x4 MIMO. In our Fastest Mobile Networks tests earlier this year, the fastest download speed we got on the Sprint network with a Galaxy S8 in New York was 81Mbps down. The comparisons aren't perfect (as the NYC network has improved since we ran those tests), but we're confident the V30+ will deliver the best Sprint speeds.. AT&T and Verizon only sell the regular V30. There are also unlocked versions of both.. Be careful about the model you choose, though, because each unit has different LTE bands. The key bands to look for are Band 41, Sprint's fastest LTE band; Band 46, which is the "LAA" 5GHz band that AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon will use for in-building coverage; and Band 71, T-Mobile's new rural coverage band .. The Sprint version has LTE bands 2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/20/25/26/41. And the unlocked version has 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/25/66.. As you can see, the unlocked model lacks all three of those key new bands. This is mostly a problem for Sprint customers right now, as Sprint coverage already relies heavily on Band 41, and T-Mobile has just started to roll out 66 and 71. If you want the best coverage and speeds, you'll have to stay in your lane with your carrier's own model.. Just for fun, let's bring in the AT&T and Verizon standard V30 unlocked models as well. The AT&T version has bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/29/30/38/39/40/41/66. Bands 29 and 30 are AT&T supplementary bands for crowded cities, and only the AT&T model has them. The Verizon model brings in LAA, but the AT&T one doesn't. They both have the Sprint bands. The LG V30 is one of our favorite phones , because its wide-angle camera offers a very different perspective on the world than the single or 2x cameras you find on other smartphones. If you're trying to capture a whole stage, a whole performance, or a whole field, the V30 is the high-end smartphone for you.. The V30+ steps up with the V30's other prime attraction, its audio. LG's dedicated DACs have a cult following, and the V30+ gives you the maximum possible space for your audio files. Sprint users will also thrill to the phone squeezing never-before-seen speeds out of their carrier's network.. That said, given the V30+'s other features are the same as the V30's, we still prefer the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 overall in the high-priced, large form factor Android phone world. The Note 8 has a better screen, better low-light camera performance, and better battery life. The Samsung Galaxy S8 , meanwhile, is our overall Android choice, as it delivers most of what these phones do for $200 less.. Bottom Line: With tons of storage and powerful music capabilities, the LG V30+ is the ultimate phone for audiophiles, and one of only two phones capable of reaching the fastest speeds on Sprint..

The Mrs and I upgraded at the same time, she got a Samsung Note 8... It comes with the old charger converter and a USB to USB C converter, the V30+ does not... shame, shame considering they're almost the same price (about $30 difference).. It's a good phone so far and a great improvement for me.. Rated 4 out of. I bought this a month ago and I am so happy that I did. Rated 2 out of. Quality issues with several things, screen quality is nowhere near what I have on my LG v20. The other major issue is that the wifi calling drops calls before connecting when the Bluetooth is enabled. GPS is not great, its generally off by about 10ft. It also came with a ton of garbageware preinstalled which may have been sprint and not LG but why cant I uninstall junk like the facebook app? very disappointed that I am unable to uninstall all of the amazon apps(amazon, kindle, music), android pay, Audible, Cloud print, all the Facebook apps(a ton of them), google music & tv, Instagram, lg health, lookout, messenger, prime photos & video, slides. All of these are hard coded as uninstallable, you can only "disable" them. However with some updates they have been mysteriously re-enabled by themselves.. Rated 5 out of. I have always loved LG phones. I started with the Optimus and have graduated to the V30+. I'm never disappointed in the quality. I love photography and the V30+ has lived up to the promised quality photos I expect from LG.. Rated 5 out of. It has so many cool features.. Rated 5 out of. After much research, I finally purchased the V30 today and couldn't be happier.. Rated 4 out of. I wanted this phone because of its availability to take some of the best pictures that I've read about and seen.. Rated 5 out of. I was looking at this phone and the galaxy series and conparing the specs. Many were very similar, however the LGv30 did come out on top in a few of the categories if it wasnt a tie. The camera was my biggest concern when looking for a new phone. Both the galaxy and LG are comparable, however, the advantage with the v30 is having two lenses. Not only can the v30 take wide angle shots but the outer camera resolution is higher with a 16 and a 13 MP camera. The front facing camera is lacking with only 5MP compared to the galaxy's 8, but still a wonderful camera over all.. LG TONE PRO® Bluetooth® Wireless Stereo Headset.

It's mostly great, but the V30's screen could use some work.. The LG V30 caught me by surprise. The G6 was a strong contender when it was released earlier this year, but we've seen so many flashy flagships hit store shelves since then that I almost forgot LG was preparing another phone for the fall. And when the V30 finally showed up, I couldn't quite believe it. This? This is an LG phone?. And by excising gimmicks and rethinking its designs, LG has cooked up one of its most impressive smartphones ever. The level of polish on display is generally excellent too, which, unfortunately, throws the flaws this phone does have into sharp relief.. Screen appears gritty at low brightness. Low-light camera performance could be better. LG devices often get overshadowed by its bigger rivals, but its new V30 insists you pay attention to it. It's an elegant, well-built device with powerful performance and some of the best audio quality we've ever heard out of a smartphone. It's excellent at shooting video, too, making the V30 one of the best portable media machines out there. We just wish its generally good dual camera was better in low light, and that LG had used higher quality screens. These notable shortcomings certainly aren't great, but for many, the good will outweigh the bad.. With each new model, LG's V series has grown more conventional. It all started with the über-masculine V10 two years ago. The V30 is much tamer, and you'd never guess they were related. The V30 is supremely sleek by LG standards, with rounded edges and panes of Gorilla Glass 5 that gently curve to meet a gleaming metal frame. It helps that LG ditched the gimmicky second screen that its predecessors used -- it was of dubious value to start, and the phone is more streamlined without it. It's not the most striking smartphone out there -- Samsung devices generally have more of that wow factor -- but LG has dramatically refined its approach to design, and the V30 feels great as a result.. It's surprisingly comfortable, too, especially considering it has a 6-inch OLED screen. It wasn't that long ago that phones with screens that large were enough to make your hand hurt, but the V30 is perfectly usable with one hand. It doesn't hurt that the V30's fingerprint sensor is located on the phone's back, since it's very easy to reach with an index finger that's usually resting right next to it.. Gallery: LG V30 review | 26 Photos. Despite the fact that the V30 is remarkably slim and light, LG didn't skimp on the good stuff either. Unlike some other flagship phones we've tested this year, the V30 still has a headphone jack and a spot for microSD cards as large as 2TB on its SIM tray. Our review unit came with 64GB of internal storage, and that's plenty for most people, but I'm not going to turn my nose up at expandable storage options.. The V30's body is also rated IP68 for water and dust resistance, a feature last year's V20 notably lacked. It comes at a cost, though: the phone's 3,300mAh cell is sealed so you can't swap batteries like you could with the V10 and V20. At first I was a little disappointed, but it's not hard to see why LG changed course. Removable batteries make phones bigger, and people are used to plugging in whenever they can.. When you crank up the brightness on the V30's 6-inch, quad HD screen, it looks pretty nice: colors are punchy without being lurid, and you can pick out lots of detail on this pixel-dense (538ppi) panel. That's the nicest thing I can say about this screen. See, LG has caught a lot of flak for the panels it put in the Pixel 2 XL , but the situation is worse in the V30. As with the XL, the V30's screen has a noticeable blue cast from odd angles. I didn't mind it much on the Pixel 2 XL, and I don't mind it much here. It's a notable shortcoming for a phone of this caliber, but I wouldn't go as far as to call it a deal-breaker.. What's more troublesome is the level of grittiness and uneven lighting that's apparent on the V30's screen. It's less noticeable when the panel's brightness is cranked, but it's quite annoying when it's dark and I'm trying to read in bed. At first I actually thought my screen was dirty, but it soon became clear that that's just how it was made. I ran into this issue with our pre-production V30 test unit too. The egregious banding I saw on the pre-release phone is gone, but I hoped LG had started using better panels.. Thankfully, the audio situation is much better. Listening to music through the phone's single, bottom-firing speaker is pleasant enough, but everything changes when you plug in a pair of headphones and fire up the built-in Hi-Fi DAC. Not only does music get substantially louder, but it sounds a little more natural and lively too. And that's with the sound profile set to the flat, "normal" mode. If your tastes are a little more particular, there are four other EQ presets to choose from, as well as a handful of "digital filters" that let you further tweak the sound. That's overkill for most people, but there's no denying that even leaving the DAC's settings alone produces better audio. It's gotten to the point where, even on days when I'm testing other phones, I make sure to keep the V30 in my bag to help drown out the din of the subway.. Sorry, Oreo fans -- while the V20 was the first device to ship with Nougat last year, the LG couldn't finagle the same sweetheart deal for the V30. Instead, it runs the most recent version of Nougat (7.1.2, for those keeping count). Still, multi-window mode is handy as ever for running two apps at the same time, and they get more room to breathe, thanks to the V30's 18:9 aspect ratio. Google's Assistant is present as well, and remains (to me, at least) the gold standard for smartphone virtual assistants.. There are a few things that you'll need to get used to, though. By default, the V30 doesn't have an app launcher, so all your newly downloaded apps get splayed across your home screen. It's easy enough to revive the traditional launcher, and it's worth the effort if only for the handy app search bar.. And remember how earlier V-series phones had the weird second screen above the main display? That's gone. LG stuck those shortcuts and controls into what it calls a "floating bar." It's off by default, and I'm really not surprised. The ability to change tracks or add an event to your calendar is nice, but since there isn't a dedicated screen that's always on to access those shortcuts from, you have to unlock the phone before you can get at them. I appreciate LG trying to maintain some feature parity between its new and older devices, but the floating bar is a poor replacement for a gimmick that was of debatable utility in the first place.. The rest of LG's built-in apps are as colorful and useful as always, and some widgets have been slightly redesigned to make use of the bigger screen. They're nothing to write home about, though.. What is worth discussing, however, is the bloatware situation. Our review unit was provided by Verizon, and as such, it's filled to the brim with apps nobody asked for. There are seven apps in a home screen folder conveniently labeled "Verizon," two pre-loaded games and four Yahoo apps. (Just a reminder: In addition to owning Engadget, Verizon also owns Yahoo's media properties. Verizon has no editorial control over us, though, so I'm going to keep blasting it for its obnoxious pre-loaded apps.). Most troubling is the addition of AppFlash, a home screen panel that offers quick access to frequently used apps, news stories and a search bar that surfaces local hotspots. It sounds useful enough, and it is, but the Electronic Frontier Foundation is firm in its belief that AppFlash amounts to spyware. Thanks, but no thanks, Verizon -- it's all pretty easy to uninstall or disable.. The V30's main draw is its dual camera, and with good reason: It's one of the best LG has ever made. The star of the show is a 16-megapixel main shooter with a f/1.6 aperture, and it's complemented nicely by a 13-megapixel wide-angle camera. Other smartphone makers have invested in other kinds of dual-camera setups (most notably Huawei and its secondary monochrome sensors), but I've always preferred the telephoto/wide-angle combo, since it offers more flexibility.. Gallery: LG V30 camera samples | 35 Photos. Images captured with the main camera feature lots of detail and bright, natural colors when there was lots of light around. Low-light performance wasn't amazing on the pre-production V30 we tested, though, and it hasn't gotten much better here. The main camera has optical image stabilization and a very wide aperture -- that's normally a winning combination, but it's not perfect here. Sometimes I'd get a great shot without thinking about it. Most of the time, though, the V30 struggled to pick up fine details in dim lighting that the Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone 8 Plus gathered with no problem. Sadly, that's not the kind of thing LG's myriad photo modes and filters can fix.. Meanwhile, the wide-angle camera routinely churned out pleasant-looking landscapes, and being able to capture more of the space around you without moving is definitely helpful. It struggled to pick up detail in some situations, but that's not a surprise, since it shoots at a lower resolution. Even so, it's a big improvement over the V20's wide-angle camera, which produced a ton of distortion around the edges of photos. It also churns out passable wide shots in dim lighting, especially if you're willing to fiddle with settings, but your best bet is to stick to the main camera. Devices like the Note 8 and Google's new Pixel 2 series are better all-around still cameras, but respectable image quality and nuanced controls mean the V30's camera is a serious contender.. More than anything, though, LG built the V30 to shoot video, and it shows. The V30 offers a truly remarkable level of control over the footage you capture -- perfect for YouTubers and would-be videographers. We did a separate deep dive into the V30's cinematographic chops here , so I won't rehash everything we learned. Long story short, the V30 can do more than stand in for a proper video camera in a pinch -- it could feasibly replace one for some people. Ultimately, it's all about the control, and there is a lot of that available here.. Of course, you don't need to be a Kubrick wannabe to get great video results. A handful of features help imbue footage with an almost professional flair, like color presets that can drastically change the feel and atmosphere of your shots. Personally, I've fallen in love with LG's slick point-zoom feature. Tapping on the screen locks a focal point, and you can zoom in and out of it, even if that point is off in the corner of the frame. It's these little additions that no one else has thought of that make the V30 such a pleasure to use. Here's hoping LG makes still-image quality as much of a priority as video next time.. LG V30 Google Pixel 2 XL LG G6 Galaxy Note 8 AnTuTu (total) 145,783 159,382 141,065 166,673 3DMark IS Unlimited 28,193 39,235 30,346 38,960 GFXBench 3.0 1080p Manhattan Offscreen (fps) 49 52 42 55 CF-Bench 61,958 N/A 24,748 67,415 The competition Wrap-up. Like a lot of other flagships this year, the V30 runs on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, along with the Adreno 540 GPU and 4GB of RAM. It's a well-worn combination, to be sure, but it's definitely an effective one. The V30 has been a speedy, smooth companion -- lag was virtually nonexistent as I bounced between apps. And it didn't break a sweat when I fired up intense games like Afterpulse and Tempest .. When it comes to day-to-day use, the V30 is pretty average. On a typical day, I'd pull the V30 off the charger at around 8 AM, take it to work, run it through my usual routine, and get a low-battery warning at around 9 PM. That's not bad -- I got similar results out of the Galaxy Note 8, and I've occasionally found the V30 still clinging to life after nights when I had forgotten to charge it. Thankfully, the phone is pretty quick to charge: When it's completely dead, a 15-minute top-up was enough to get the V30's up to between 25 and 30 percent. Another 15 minutes on top of that usually pushed the phone close to 55 percent. A bigger battery would've been nice, but you won't have trouble getting through the day if you make at least one pit stop at a wall outlet.. The V30 is the most appealing phone LG has made in a long time, but the smartphone competition this year is incredibly fierce. Samsung's Galaxy S8 Plus runs with the same chipset but pairs it with an almost flawless Infinity Display -- the V30's OLED screen simply doesn't stack up. Samsung arguably also wins on design, and the S8 Plus packs a first-rate 12-megapixel camera. Then there's Google's Pixel 2 XL , a device that's very closely related to the V30. The Pixel display is similar to the V30's, but thankfully, it doesn't have the same grainy look as the LG. Plus a cleaner version of Android means the Pixel just feels a little bit faster. There are strong reasons to pick either of these phones over the V30, but here's what it boils down to: If you're serious about audio and video quality, the V30 wins.. When I first took the V30 for a spin, I was surprised by my own optimism. At last, LG had made a phone that seemed to tick all the right boxes. After more prolonged testing, I'm not quite as enamored -- thanks mostly to its questionable screen. Still, I'm impressed with what LG has managed to accomplish. The V30's design and build quality are first rate, performance is up to snuff for a flagship, and I'm in love with the way this thing sounds. Hopefully, LG irons out these sketchy screen issues, because otherwise the V30 is a worthy phone in danger of being overshadowed.. gear , lg , lgv30 , mobile , review , smartphone , v30.

A strong competitor for 2017’s best Android phone.. Lacking video and photo editing features. Fast and smooth performance, no Android 8.0 Oreo.

But just because it’s the best LG can do, doesn’t mean it’s the best you can buy. This year more than ever, the competition is incredibly stiff. failure, the company attacked 2017 with vigor, releasing the G6 , the Q6 , and now the V30. It’s a really strong line-up, and completely different from the company’s previous attempts to win over smartphone buyers. In our LG V30 review, we examine why the V30 is LG’s finest hour — and how its approach to camera and video technology differs from others.. The first casualty of LG’s latest smartphone assault is, ironically, the LG G6, which released early this year. Given the choice between the two, you should pick the V30. It’s more powerful, it’s lighter, it has a better camera, and it’s better looking.. While the G6’s 18:9 aspect ratio screen was a trendsetter, the design around it wasn’t refined. LG has changed that with the V30. The body is slimmer, smoother, and more rounded. The “ bezel-less ” smartphone design trend continues, where the edges flanking the screen are slimmer than ever. It’s less masculine, and more svelte. It’s more breakable due to the glass rear panel, which is attached to a metal chassis; but LG has put the phone through 14 military standard toughness tests, so it shouldn’t break at the first hint of a drop. That’s not necessarily the case, however, as the rear glass on one of our early preview units cracked after a short, three-foot drop to the floor — we recommend grabbing a case .. On the back of the phone is a fingerprint sensor, which is sensibly placed in the top center of the phone, away from the camera lens. Hear that, Samsung ? It’s very fast to unlock the phone, but there’s another alternative we’re enjoying a lot— face unlock. It doesn’t use an iris scanner like the Galaxy Note 8 , but it’s still very effective. It works from the always-on lock screen too, and we found it to be faster than the Galaxy Note 8’s face unlock system.. The fingerprint sensor doubles as the power button, and the volume rocker can be found on the left edge of the phone. On the bottom edge, you’ll find a USB Type-C charging port, next to a bottom-firing speaker. Don’t worry — there’s a headphone jack, and it’s at the top.. The LG V30 can compete with the best and is the best phone LG has made. LG has sealed up the V30 like the G6, which removes a previous V-series standard feature: A replaceable battery. There’s a reason for this sacrifice — an IP68 water resistance rating. That means you should be able to take the V30 underwater up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. While many will lament the loss of a replaceable battery, this is a worthwhile trade in our book. and plentiful these days, and the V30’s battery lasts an amazingly long time (more on this later).. The V30 is beautiful, eye-catching, minimalist, and incredibly stylish. We love the cloud-silver color option, but there’s a sleek black model available from some carriers. Sadly, our favorite Moroccan blue variant isn’t available in the U.S. The V-series evolution from ugly duckling (sorry, V10 ) through the rather faceless V20 , to the jaw-dropping V30 is pleasing to behold.. It’s not all good news, though. The V30 doesn’t feel as high-end as the iPhone 8. or the Note 8 when you hold it in the hand, largely because it’s lightweight and it feels a little cheap. The curved edges also make the V30 quite sharp to hold. It’s not that comfortable, and the metal chassis makes the device slippery. Looking at the V30 is wonderful; holding the V30 isn’t quite so good.. But all these design and style changes are evidence of confusion. The V-series was often indirectly promoted as a business phone, like the Samsung Note and Huawei Mate series; but it never really felt like such a device. We found it to be the technical showcase for LG, excelling in the camera and audio department.. The V30 is even less of a business-first phone, and is really the flagship device the G6 should have been. Still, its sophisticated looks mean it’s just as much at home on the boardroom table as it is peeping out from the pocket of your skinny jeans. We love that, and it’s a testament to LG’s thoughtful design approach to this year’s smartphone range.. The V30 is LG’s first phone to use an OLED screen since the G Flex 2, a surprising statistic given the company’s devotion to OLED panels on its excellent televisions. We’re partial to OLED screens. because they offer incredibly inky blacks and great color accuracy. You’ll be happy LG brought it back, because the V30’s screen is gorgeous. It has a 2,880 × 1,440 pixel resolution, with blacks as deep as night and colors so vibrant and realistic you won’t want to turn away. Video is a delight — make sure you try Netflix’s HDR10 content. to really see what the V30 offers — and the 6-inch display size is perfect for longer viewing periods.. As we mentioned earlier, the V30 has a nearly edgeless display, with bezels above and below the screen smaller than those on the LG G6. The screen ratio is 18:9, so it’s longer and thinner than traditional phones like the OnePlus 5. The benefits include more room for list-based apps like Twitter and Facebook and for web-browsing in general, plus for certain movies and TV shows available on Netflix and Amazon Prime.. While we like the V30’s screen, the curved edges can be frustrating. It’s incredibly sensitive around the sides, where certain apps can be activated by accident, and touching the sides with your palm can prevent characters from being pressed when typing.. Design isn’t the only reason the V30 beats the G6 — the second is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor inside, rather than the Snapdragon 821 in the G6. Samsung reportedly cornered the Snapdragon 835 market for the Galaxy S8. earlier this year, which is why LG wasn’t able to use it. The G6 isn’t slow, but the V30 is noticeably faster, smoother, and more pleasurable to use.. We have yet to run into any hiccups with performance, and the 4GB of RAM certainly has to help. Switching between apps is fast, apps launch swiftly, and multitasking is buttery smooth. We’ve played games such Tiny Archers and Maximum Car and they ran perfectly.. We’ve run some benchmarks to see how the LG V30 performs:. The V30’s scores are in line with other smartphones that use the Snapdragon 835. It slightly beats out the Samsung Galaxy Note 8’s AnTuTu score of 167,946, but perhaps to Apple’s testament, it falls short of the 222,462 score of the A11 Bionic processor. powering the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. The V30 runs Android 7.1.2, and LG hasn’t shared a timeline with info on when Oreo will arrive. Oreo introduces new features such as picture-in-picture mode and Notification Dots, which you can learn more about in our in-depth Android 8 guide .. We had a lot of software problems using a Korean pre-production LG V30. We experienced problems saving photos to the MicroSD card and the internal memory, some operations would cause the phone to stop responding, and we had more than a few lock-ups that resulted in the phone rebooting. We didn’t experience any of these problems in two of our U.S. pre-production units, nor did we see these issues in a final AT&T LG V30 retail unit. We’ll continue to monitor our retail unit to see if we experience any of these problems.. Does the lack of version 8.0 mean the software experience is poor? Not at all. Nougat is still a great version of Google’s Android mobile operating system. LG packs plenty of customizable features into the phone, such as how you can double tap the screen to wake it or turn it off; and Smart Settings lets you create profiles so the phone automatically turns the notification sound on when it detects you’re at home.. LG’s Android skin, the theme that makes the software look unique to LG, has come a long way. It’s still not our favorite looking Android skin, and it can look rather dated in some parts of the interface, such as the Settings menu.. Previous V-series phones had a secondary display above the main screen showing notifications, shortcuts, and other information. This feature has been retired for the V30 due to the new bezel-less shape, and it has been replaced by a software alternative. The “Floating Bar” is an expandable arrow icon that sits anywhere on your home screen, and you can customize it with shortcuts. Tap on the arrow icon and the bar expands, giving you one-click access to important contacts, and apps you don’t want to clutter your home screen with.. We liked the quick access to music controls because they really saved time and extra taps, and the app shortcuts can be handy if you’re the type who likes to control what your home screen looks like. We didn’t find quick access to screen capture tools useful. The V20’s secondary display was glanceable, the new “floating bar” isn’t. If you use Android widgets, it’s a similar notion, but it’s not a functional replacement for the secondary display.. The LG V30’s camera is better, and not just because of the f/1.6 aperture — a smartphone first. The wider aperture means the V30 is capable of taking in more light.. But the V30 excels because of video performance. LG says it’s tapping into the growing obsession with video, as the company claims 78 percent of Millennials take video on their phones once a week. Get the V30 in these people’s hands, and they’ll be shooting video a lot more than that.. The reason is Cine Effect, which at its heart is a collection of 15 filters for video, made to replicate typical movie genres. These include filters such as “romantic comedy,” “thriller,” and “blockbuster.” But these aren’t your average Instagram filter. LG’s Cine Effects are live, responding to environmental changes to maintain the look (something that’s not needed with still filters), and color tuned by Hollywood cinematographers. It’s a pro mode without the challenge of mastering a pro mode.. How do they change your video? What’s interesting is LG’s decision to create them according to mood and feeling, rather than trying to sum up a look with an obscure word. It really helps pick the right effect for the situation. In addition to changing the look, Cine Effect has a clever Point Zoom mode that lets you choose a subject on screen, then use a slider to zoom in on it. The effect is cinematic, and output can give the impression you’re using a more expensive, professional camera.. The LG V30 is a masterful movie-making machine.. Put all this together and the end result can be startling. Yes you need to be creative, and have a story you want to tell in mind; but the V30 has the ability to make those ideas reality in a way other phones don’t. We gave the V30’s Cine Effect a workout. when the phone was announced in Berlin, and had a lot of fun doing it. That’s key, because shooting video is harder work than taking stills, and it needs to be enjoyable and worthwhile for us to put in the effort.. The V30 doesn’t have an editing app to put your movie together, and the zoom mode isn’t dynamic, so if your subject moves you end up zooming in on nothing.. Take stills, and the V30 is equally impressive due to its 13-megapixel f/1.9 wide-angle dual-lens camera. Unlike most other dual-lens cameras, the V30 doesn’t bother with the blurred background bokeh effect. Instead the second lens takes 120-degree wide-angle shots, and they can be spectacular. The creative opportunities are huge, provided you are in the right place at the right time.. It’s not a camera mode you’ll use all the time, but put it in front of a beautiful vista, sweeping cityscapes, or anything that needs, “taking in” with the naked eye, and the V30 will capture it like no other camera. LG has also worked hard to minimize the distortion, or fish-eye effect, and has done a great job. Now, straight lines remain almost straight at the edge of the frame, making images more natural, and far less surreal than those taken with the G6.. It’s joined by a 71-degree angle 16-megapixel main lens with an f/1.6 aperture. Night shots do look great, but the V30 still needs light to bring out the best. The selfie camera is the same as on the G6, with a wide-angle setting and a comprehensive beauty mode. It hasn’t been reworked like the rear camera, but arguably it didn’t need much improvement.. The V30 is a masterful movie-making machine. We’ve been shooting product videos with it, and have been very impressed with the results.. LG says the V30 doesn’t need a battery with more capacity than the G6 due to the energy efficiency of the OLED screen and the battery-saving technology inside the Snapdragon 835 processor. The good news is LG’s right. The battery life on the V30 is impressive, as we consistently saw a day and a half from its fully charged 3,300mAh cell, even on the pre-production software, with medium to heavy use. On the final retail unit, we continually found ourselves arriving home around 6 p.m. from work with just under 50 percent remaining.. Wireless charging is included for convenience, as is fast-charging using LG’s.. If you’re looking for a high quality audio experience, the V30 improves even on the excellent G6. A quad digital to analog converter (DAC) is inside, along with AptX HD. for superior Bluetooth audio with a compatible pair of headphones. The Quad DAC comes into play with wired headphones, and boosts the audio across the range. If you haven’t heard AptX HD yet, you’re in for a treat. It’s great, and will change the way you think about wireless audio performance. A MicroSD card slot lets you store plenty of music too, though the internal storage offers 64GB of space that should be plenty for most people.. There’s no official details on an unlocked version of the V30, but it’s likely LG will eventually sell one. For now, you’ll have to buy one from one of the major carriers, or through retailers such as Best Buy. The price tag ranges from $800 on T-Mobile to $840 on Verizon, but you can always purchase it on a monthly payment plan. For example, the V30 costs $27 per month for 30 months through AT&T, or $30 per month with an $80 downpayment with T-Mobile, which comes to $800 in total.. There’s also a V30+ model , which is the same phone but with 128GB of storage. It will be available from Sprint soon. You can check out our V30 buying guide. LG phones come with standard one-year warranty that covers the device from manufacturing defects, but LG feels “so confident” about the V30’s quality that it’s offering a second year of coverage for free. You’ll have to register the device.. The LG V30 is the best phone LG has made yet, and it can compete with the best from other major manufacturers in 2017. The V30 is an excellent choice if you’re excited about shooting great video, and want a camera that doesn’t just repeat the same old bokeh effect, but does something different.. This year we’ve seen a lot of good, new phones. This makes it a tough year for every smartphone manufacturer, and us as buyers. The truth is, the V30 is as good as a Samsung Galaxy S8. It’s as good as a current Pixel XL , and it’s as good as the HTC U11. It’s not better, but there’s no way you’ll regret buying it. You won’t regret buying any of these phones.. LG’s natural competitor is Samsung’s most recent Galaxy phones, and price may be the deciding factor here.. The V30 has more interesting features — from the wide-angle camera to the Quad DAC — compared to the S8, and Google Assistant, the only virtual assistant you really need. The Galaxy Note 8 is the closer competitor, but it’s a considerably larger, and bulkier. The V30 is cheaper than the Note 8, but more expensive than the S8. This may not be a coincidence.. We’re still waiting to put the new Google Pixel 2 XL. through its paces, but early impressions are very positive, and it’s priced very closely at $850. Its camera is sure to be superb, and the promise of clean, regularly updated Android is very tempting.. The IP68 water resistance and military-tough body make the V30 more durable than many phones, but it’s by no means indestructible. Put it in a case and the phone should withstand a fair amount of abuse. The technical specifications are the best you can get at the moment, so the V30 will easily last a two-year contract and beyond.. Unsurprisingly, LG’s custom Android skin will delay updates to the operating system, but we can expect Android 8.0 Oreo to arrive next year. Buying a Google Pixel phone is the only way to ensure the timely arrival of OS updates.. The V30 looks amazing, takes video that will make you look like a Hollywood director (or dream of being one), has audio that’ll make you weep, and a glorious OLED screen. It faces some very strong competition this year, but it’s right up there with the best.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

LG V30 review: A photography and videography dream It's time to take notice. by Lanh Nguyen October 30, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Front facing camera quality lags behind competitors. In its third iteration the LG V series continues its focus on audio, photography, and videography. The LG V30 takes this experience to a whole new level with a Hi-Fi Quad DAC and a camera that is packed with features. It's the ultimate content creator phone for not only creating content on the go, but creating it with quality.. Processor Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile Platform. Storage V30: 64 GB, UFS 2.0. MicroSD expansion up to 2 TB. - Main: 16 MP Standard Angle sensor with Æ/1.6 aperture, laser detection autofocus, OIS, EIS. - Secondary: 13 MP Wide Angle sensor with Æ/1.9 aperture. - 5 MP Wide Angle sensor with Æ/2.2 aperture. Audio 32-bit Advanced Hi-Fi Quad DAC. IP rating / other certifications IP68 water and dust resistance. Connectivity Wi-Fi 802.11 a, b, g, n, ac. Colors Aurora Black, Cloud Silver, Moroccan Blue, Lavender Violet. Dimensions and weight 151.7 x 75.4 x 7.3 mm. The LG V series of smartphones has always been for those who want a phone that is a photo, video, and audio powerhouse. Now in its third iteration, LG aims to achieve that goal once again by refining its recipe even further. With a refreshed design, a bezel-less screen, and a host of new camera features, is the V30 the phone to beat this holiday season? Find out in our LG V30 review!. Buy LG V30 Plus on Amazon. series tend to have iterative designs for a couple generations before completely revamping things. No series has changed more drastically since it’s inception than the V series. Instead of the G5-esque metal of last year’s V20 , or the chunky duraskin of the original LG V10 , the LG V30 now boasts a design that is very similar to many other smartphones on the marketâ it’s made of glass.. There’s glass on the phone’s front and back with a metal frame sandwiched in between. The glass gathers fingerprints quite easily, which is to be expected, but it’s not as slippery as you might expect, especially without any sort of added texture for grip. The corners and sides are rounded and the back has a slight taper along the edges, which gives it a sleek and comfortable feel. It’s easily one of the most comfortable and beautiful looking phones I’ve used this year.. Although the design and materials used are pretty different from previous V series entries, LG managed to retain a MIL-810G rating against shocks and drops despite the phone having a more luxurious appeal versus the V10 and V20’s more rugged looks.. Another drastic change that LG made to the V30 this year is with the display. Not only has LG switched up the display technology but the once signature secondary screen is now gone. It lives on in the form of a software feature, but we’ll talk about that later.. The screen is now a 6.0-inch POLED display with 18:9 aspect ratio and a resolution of 2880 x 1440 or QHD+. LG calls the display a “Full Vision” display, a buzzword for a screen that practically goes edge to edge. By no means is the LG V30 a one-handed phone, but thanks to the aspect ratio and minimal bezels, it feels far more manageable than other 6-inch phones like the Nexus 6 or 6P.. LG's switch back to OLED is certainly a welcome change.. LG’s switch back to OLED is certainly a welcome change and something for which many, including myself, have been waiting for a long time.. The display itself is gorgeous in every way imaginable. It’s easily LG’s best smartphone display to date and is one that can even give Samsung a run for its money. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are truly black thanks the OLED panel and it has fantastic contrast, too. Outside visibility is also quite good as it gets so bright that even under harsh sunlight the screen is still easy to read.. The large size is perfect for web browsing, checking social media, playing games, watching YouTube, or streaming Netflix, or whatever else you can throw at it. The V30’s display is just an absolute joy to use. There are still some apps out there which aren’t optimized for 18:9 though, so you will still experience letter- or pillar-boxing with videos or certain games, but I don’t find it to be that bothersome. 18:9 is still relatively new but it’s only a matter of time before developers catch up to the new standard.. The specs of the LG V30 are fairly standard 2017 flagship specs. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 835 processor, 4 GB of RAM, and the Adreno 540 GPU. In everyday use, the V30 is fast, fluid, and responsive. Apps are quick to launch, scrolling and swiping through the interface is very smooth, and more graphics-intensive tasks such as games all run with no noticeable hiccups.. The V30's performance holds up well no matter how much you push it.. Multitasking has not been an issue either as the 4 GB of RAM is plenty for running apps without any slow down. It’s an all-round pleasurable experience and the V30 holds up well no matter how much you’re pushing the device.. In terms of hardware the LG V30 comes packed to the gills. It provides everything you could want out of a 2017 flagship. The phone comes with 64 GB of storage and there’s a V30+ model which doubles the storage to 128 GB if you happen to live in a region where it’s available. the plus model is currently only available through Sprint. Storage is also expandable via microSD with support for up to an additional 256 GB if the phone’s internal storage is not enough for you. Its also got Bluetooth 5 on board for better wireless throughout and longer range connections.. The LG V30 provides everything you could want out of a 2017 flagship.. Like most phones nowadays, the LG V30 carries IP68 certification which protects the phone against dust and water for up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. This means if you get caught in the rain or drop the V30 in a puddle of water, it will survive and function perfectly fine.. The fingerprint sensor is centered on the backside, where you would typically expect to find it on an LG phone. It’s fast, accurate, reliable, and comfortable to reach with an index finger. What I enjoy most about LG’s fingerprint sensor is that it doubles as the phone’s power button. This eliminates the need for a dedicated side mounted power key and is a feature that I think more manufacturers should adopt.. Audio is a big part of the experience on the LG V30 and it’s one that audiophiles will definitely enjoy. For starters, the V30 retains the headphone jack so no adapters are required here. Secondly, the V30 utilizes a 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC from ESS Technology to drive the audio experience. This year the audio tuning is done by B&O regardless of region.. Audio is a big part of the experience on the LG V30 and it's one that audiophiles will definitely enjoy.. This means audio will be of much higher quality with less distortion, less noise, and an overall improved dynamic range. This also means that the V30 can properly drive a pair of high impedance headphones. While using high impedance will give you the best experience and allow you to take full advantage of what the Quad DAC can provide, the improved audio experience is still noticeable on a more average pair of over the ear cans.. Just like the LG G6 or last year’s V20, the Quad DAC provides a 75-stage volume control and left and right channel controls, but this year LG has added some new customization options to allow for further tuning of the audio to your ears. There are now sound presets and digital filters which make for quick and easy adjustments of the audio. Sound presets range from normal, enhanced, detailed, live, and bass. Digital filters offer the choice of short, sharp, or slow, which will either give you an ambient, natural, or clearer sound.. Another new improvement to the V30’s audio experience is the support for Master Quality Authenticated (MQA). This is a relatively new audio format that allows for Hi-Res audio output at a much smaller file size. This means that streaming Hi-Res audio is a possibility without eating up your bandwidth. There aren’t many streaming services offering MQA just yet but one of the most notable ones is Tidal. If you happen to have Tidal with the proper subscription tier you can take advantage of the Hi-Res streaming right away. Spotify is also rumored to be on the cusp of supporting MQA.. AptX HD – what is it and why should I care?. Audiophiles have rightly been sceptical of Bluetooth audio implementations in the past, with slow data transfer speeds and connection drops falling short of the quality offered by high-end wired solutions. Bluetooth technology has improved over â¦. If you prefer streaming audio over bluetooth, the V30 supports aptX HD. This is Qualcomm’s audio codec for delivering Hi-Res audio over wireless devices. While most of us will have to wait for the. Android Oreo update to get aptX HD support, LG managed to include it on the V30 running Nougat.. The V30 is the first in the V series to not offer a removable battery, although this was an expected decision considering the LG G6 also removed the feature. Without the ability to swap batteries anymore it’s important that the V30 can get you through a full day.. The 3,300 mAh battery was plenty capable of comfortably getting me through a full day no matter my usage. If you’re a light-to-moderate user who mainly uses their smartphone for browsing the web, social media, texting, and the occasional YouTube video, you’ll have no troubles getting through a full day. But in my experience, heavy use also seemed to pose no issues for the V30.. I play games quite frequently on my smartphone and watch several hours of YouTube a day. Even with all of that piled on top of more typical smartphone use, the V30 never struggled to get me through the day and five hours of screen on time, or more, was easily achievable. Fast charging is available via USB Type-C when you need to top off or fill up. The V30’s glass back also allows for wireless charging if you don’t want to fuss with cables.. A big draw for the LG V30, as with prior V series smartphones, is its camera experience. You won’t find another smartphone that packs more features into its camera than the V30.. You won't find another smartphone that packs more features into its camera than the V30.. Just like last year’s V20 and the more current LG G6, the V30 offers two rear camerasâ one standard and one wide angle lens. The main sensor is a 16 MP shooter with an f/1.6 aperture, OIS, and laser and phase detection autofocus. The secondary wide angle sensor comes in at 13 MP with a slightly narrower aperture of f/1.9. There’s no OIS on the secondary sensor, but it doesn’t need it due to its wide angle and the focus being set to infinity.. The V30’s cameras have a lot of feature. While many are from previous V series phones, others have made their way over from the LG G6. Like snap shot, which let’s you take a photo and instantly see the preview in the bottom half of the viewfinder, or guide shot, for matching the framing and composition of a previously taken photo.. LG V30 vs Galaxy Note 8: Camera features. Smartphone cameras have grown in importance over the past couple of years, with most manufacturers aiming to follow the lead of LG, Huawei and others in adopting dual-camera setups. Dual cameras come with several benefits â¦. Manual controls are available on both the photo and video side of things. While this isn’t a unique feature, LG’s manual controls are very extensive, offering useful tools that you normally only find on DSLRs or mirrorless cameras such as a histogram, horizon leveler, and focus peaking.. One of the newest features that LG has added to the V30’s camera is called Graphy. This let’s you take the look and feel of a pre-existing photo and apply its settings to the next photo that you take. This not only gives your photo a very specific look but it means you don’t have to fumble around with filters or editing the photo after the fact. It works well but the pre-existing image that you pick needs to match the current lighting situation or else you’ll have to make adjustments to ISO and shutter speed for the proper exposure.. The other new features added to the camera apply to video, and will help you take your smartphone videography to the next level. First is the ability to shoot log footage. Log profile is typically found in DLSRs or mirrorless cameras. It provides a flatter image and better dynamic range allowing for heavier manipulation in post production.. If you’ve ever shot in log you’ll definitely appreciate the presence of this feature, but it isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. The bitrate from the footage is rather low even when on high settings, making it tough to push the colors in post production without the image falling apart. The log footage is also extremely green in color and it takes quite a bit of effort to get the colors and peoples’ skin tones looking natural. The availability of log footage alone definitely puts the V30’s video recording capabilities miles ahead of other smartphone cameras, but it could be better.. The availability of log footage alone definitely puts the V30's video recording capabilities miles ahead of other smartphone cameras, but it could be better.. If you’re not into grading footage in post production, LG has another feature called Cine Video. This lets you shoot video while applying LUTs, or color grading presets, directly in camera, to give you the desired look. It’s simple, easy and eliminates the need for off loading your footage in order to grade it. I would imagine most users will use this instead of log, due to the simplicity alone.. Flagship smartphones tend to perform very well outdoors or in well-lit situations and the LG V30 is no different. Photos are nice and crisp with plenty of detail and sharpness and the colors have a pleasant amount of vibrancy to them. The V30 also does not appear to be as aggressive with sharpening as previous LG phones which is a definite improvement. Dynamic range could be better, though, as detail in highlights is lost due to overexposure in these areas.. The wide angle lens is certainly a lot of fun to use and makes it easy to fit more into the frame without having to take steps backwards. It makes landscape shots look breathtaking and there’s less barrel distortion now, meaning you no longer have that GoPro-like look at the edges of the shot.. The quality of the wide angle lens is not as good as the main sensor, but it's a lot of fun to use.. As expected, the quality of the wide angle lens is not as good as the main sensor. The lack of autofocus means a softer image overall and overexposure in highlights is more problematic. These problems become more apparent as the lights start to dim and the sun sets.. Images from the wide angle lens in low light lack sharpness, detail, and typically struggle with proper white balance. The main sensor achieves much better results in every aspect including overall color, and black levels are handled well without much noise or clipping. While there are times you may want to use the wide angle lens in low light such as a quick group photo, I’d recommend you avoid using it if you can due to its inferior picture quality when compared to the main sensor.. For selfie lovers, the V30 sadly doesn’t come with the most impressive front-facing camera. Its 5 MP resolution is fairly low compared to most other smartphones on the market. The quality is passable though and still good enough for social media, but it falls behind competitors in features and overall quality.. The software experience on the LG V30 is very similar to LG’s early 2017 flagship, the G6. If you’ve used any recent LG phone you should already know what to expect. LG’s UI feels are improved with this iteration, with cleaner app redesigns and less intrusive software feature. But it still feels somewhat cartoony to me. Though some animations are still rather awkward, icons are bright and vivid and there are many color flourishes sprinkled throughout the UI.. The always on display is one of my favorites. Not only is it great for showing battery-friendly notifications and access to commonly used functions such as the flashlight, wifi, or media controls, but it’s also highly customizable. There are many different clocks to choose from and LG preloads a good amount of fun images that can be used for the AOD, or you can use a custom image of your own.. One of the newest software tweaks to the LG V30 is the floating bar. This feature’s purpose is meant to replace the functionality that was previously achieved through the secondary display of the V20 and V10. The floating bar is simply a toggle bar that can be repositioned anywhere along either edge of the display and is brought into view with a simple tap. It’s a similar concept to Samsung’s edge UX as it can be used for shortcuts to apps or specific phone functions, provide media controls, contact shortcuts, and different screen capture functions such as creating a GIF or drawing on a screenshot.. While I don’t use this feature much I personally like this implementation better, as the secondary display on the V10 and V20 were tough to use due to their location. Because the floating bar is also software based it can easily be turned off, whereas previously you were stuck with the secondary display whether you liked it or not.. Currently the LG V30 is running on Android Nougat and not the latest Android Oreo , which is odd considering the V20 was the first phone to launch with Nougat last year. It seems like LG couldn’t pull the same trick this year with its accelerated launch window, but fingers crossed that it will get the delicious Oreo update soon.. The unlocked LG V30 is available for pre-order now through B&H for $829.99 with expected availability in December. carriers prices will vary, so expect it to cost you $800 or more. While the price tag is certainly no drop in the bucket, it’s fairly standard flagship pricing and still undercuts competing devices like the Galaxy Note 8 .. The LG V30 justifies its price tag and is easily a top contender for smartphone of the year.. LG’s goal with the V series has always been to provide a photo, video, and audio experience that is unparalleled by any other smartphone. Not only does it beautifully tick all those boxes, it’s also wrapped up in one sleek package. The design is gorgeous and even greater to hold, and the display is quite the attention grabber. The LG V30 justifies its price tag and is easily a top contender for smartphone of the year. If you haven’t paid attention to the LG V series of smartphones, this is one year you definitely should..

LG V30: Everything you need to know!. What do I need to know about the LG V30?. Sometime around late 2016, LG decided to stop trying to win smartphone market share with gimmickry, instead concentrating on just making good products. The LG G6 was the first product of this new approach from the Korean company, winning praise from critics, but not really moving the needle against local rival Samsung's Galaxy S8. For late 2017, LG has its new V30 phone. It's technically a successor to the video-focused V10 and V20 — but there's a clean break in terms of design language, as LG ditches the removable battery and instead goes all-in on metal and glass.. This is our guide to everything you need to know about LG's best phone to date.. Check out our LG V30 review. We've been using the LG V30 for the past couple months, in multiple countries and with multiple networks. Check out our LG V30 review for extended thoughts on the phone's build quality, software, camera and battery life. And you'll also want to take a look at our video review below, which packages all that info into a concise 13-minute presentation.. It hits the sweet spot for a 'big' phone. With a 6-inch display, you might expect the LG V30 to feel enormous in the hand. However, like its little brother the G6 , the V30 uses a taller 18:9 aspect ratio, which ( because geometry ) has a smaller screen area than a 16:9 phone with the same diagonal measurement. In short: It's big, but not unmanageable. In the hand, the LG V30 feels about the same size as a 5.5-inch, 16:9 phone like the HTC U11.. Needless to say, if you're used to lugging around a V10 or V20, the V30 is going to feel significantly more portable than your old handset.. It's also slimmer and lighter, on account of the metal and glass construction used throughout. In fact, the V30 weighs even less than the G6, despite its larger screen size and identical battery capacity.. The LG G6 irked customers in some countries by leaving out wireless charging or the legendary Quad DAC in some regions. Not so this time around: All V30s are made equal.. Regardless of where you buy the V30, you'll get both wireless charging built-in, and high-performance wired audio thanks to LG's Hi-Fi Quad DAC.. The only outlier is internal storage space. There's an "LG V30+" sold in some countries (like the United States, where it's available on Sprint and US Cellular ), but this is just the same old LG V30 with a roomier 128GB of space. In addition, all V30s come with a standard high-end spec loadout: Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835, 4GB of RAM and Android 7.1.2 Nougat. There's also an absurdly priced LG V30 Signature Edition with 6GB of RAM, 256GB of internal storage, and a ceramic back instead of glass. The Signature Edition V30 is only available in South Korea and can be had for a cool $1800 USD.. In addition to raw hardware specs, you'll have (up to) four colors to choose from: Aurora Black, Cloud Silver, Moroccan Blue, and Lavender Violet. Naturally, not all hues will be available on all carriers, or all regions. (In the United States, black and silver are the dominant colors.). The second screen is no more. It compares really well with the Pixel 2 XL. LG is no stranger to dual cameras on smartphones, having included the feature on the back since the G5 (and on the front since the V10). The LG V30 is LG's best dual camera setup yet, with a 16-megapixel main shooter behind an f/1.6 lens, and a new, brighter wide-angle camera with less distortion, and an f/1.9 lens. The main camera is a solid step up from the G6 in all conditions. But the biggest improvement comes in wide-angle photography, where the brighter lens and improved post-processing allow for clearer wide-angle pics in the dark.. Besides photography, LG has built out some impressive new video capabilities. The V30 includes LG Cine Log mode, which captures photos with flatter colors, so that more dynamic range can be brought out in post-production. It's similar to the techniques used by professional filmmakers, and worth a look if you plan on editing footage from the V30 in an app like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut. And if you just want to give your footage a specific look without exporting to a PC, there are several color presets you can use. You could make your footage look like a dark, gritty thriller, or a light romantic comedy, all with a single tap.. The secondary ticker display has been a stable V-series feature since the beginning, but as LG moves towards OLED and slimmer, lighter phones, second screen has been retired. In its place, there's a new "floating bar" feature, bascially a little arrow icon that you can drag around the screen, and tap to conjure up a list of app or settings shortcuts.. The feature works similarly to Samsung's Edge Screen on its Galaxy phones, though with less disruption to apps you're currently using in the background. In any case, if you decide the floating bar isn't for you, it's easy to disable it by dragging it up to the "Remove" icon at the top of the display.. It's the first phone to support T-Mobile's 600Mhz network. Google collaborated closely with LG to produde the Pixel 2 XL, and it shows. The phones have the same display panel, roughly the same size, and mostly similar internal hardware. There are key differences however: the Pixel 2 XL ditched the headphone jack this year, while LG doubled down and included an excellent Quad DAC for every version of the V30. The V30 also includes a glass back, allowing for Qi wireless charging, while the Pixel's metal backing prevents that. Finally, the V30 includes LG's now-famous dual camera setup, with the secondary lense used for wide-angle shots. The Pixel sticks with a single camera, though does use some wild algorithms to produce portrait shots.. Another key difference is software, and in this light the V30 comes a little worse off. The phone launched with Android 7.1.2 Nougat , while the Pixel line launched with Android 8.0 Oreo. The Pixel line will also be the first to receieve new feature and security updates, while the V30 may lag behind in that regard depending on region and carrier. The Pixel 2 XL is only $50 more than the V30, so it really comes down to whether you value software features — fast updates and minimal bloat — over hardware features — the dual camera, wireless charging and Quad DAC.. Need better T-Mobile coverage in rural areas across the U.S.? The V30 is your phone.. The LG V30 is the first device to support T-Mobile's burgeoning 600Mhz network, which offers much better coverage across greater distances than the rest of T-Mo's network.. It's still rolling out — only a few areas across the country are currently covered — but it should be fairly ubiquitous by this time next year.. The LG V30 is the first phone to run on T-Mobile's new 600Mhz network. There's a gorgeous pink variant coming soon. The V30 launched with Nougat , but LG has started rolling out the update to Android 8.0 Oreo to the device. The update is starting in South Korea, with other regions to follow shortly.. More: Stable Oreo update now rolling out to the LG V30 in South Korea. An upgraded LG V30s may be in the works. The V30 launched in standard smartphone colors — black, silver, blue and violet. At CES 2018, the company showed off the new "Raspberry Rose" version, and it looks striking to say the least. The deep pink will definitely stand out in the crowd, and customers in South Korea, Europe and Asia will be able to pick this version up soon.. More: LG V30 is getting a stunning Raspberry Rose color. Expensive, but not Note expensive. According to one report, LG may use the 2018 Mobile World Congress to announce an upgraded version of the V30. Currently referred to as the V30s, the phone is expected to feature identical specs compared to the original model – save for an increased 256GB of internal storage.. The biggest difference is that the V30s will be the first phone to ship with something called "LG Lens." LG Lens is similar to what we've seen from Google Lens on the Pixel 2 and Bixby Vision on the Galaxy S8, meaning you'll be able to use the V30s's camera to shop for items, use AR for GPS navigation, etc.. More: LG V30s may come to MWC with AI camera tech and 256GB storage. The proximity of the V30's release to that of Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 — as well as the local rivalry between Samsung and LG — invites comparisons between the two phones. But aside from the size difference (the Note is *much * taller), LG is targeting a slightly lower price point.. More questions? Check out the forums!. More: Where to buy the LG V30. That said, the V30 is not a cheap phone. carriers start at $800, and in the UK an unlocked LG V30 will set you back an eye-watering £799. LG phones tend to pick up heavy discounts not long after launch, so it's probable you'll be able to pick one up for $750 or less by the end of the year.. Still, the V30's launch pricing is a far cry from the $900+ folks have been paying for the Note 8.. The Android Central LG V30 forums are a great place to chat with other V30 owners (and soon-to-be owners), and get answers to more of your burning questions..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. LG’s new flagship is a tempting, high-powered package. The LG V30 is a confident step forward, not just for LG’s experimental smartphone branch, but for its flagship devices in general. Simply put, this is LG’s best in recent memory and as a result, it’s also one of 2017’s best smartphones.. Selfies and low-light photography aren’t industry-leading. LG V30 price and release date Available now in US, UK and AU $809 unlocked in US, £799, AU$1,199 (for the V30+) Design Understated design lets the screen stand out Feels very light considering all of the tech inside Waterproofing and military-grade toughness are always welcome Where's the second screen?. The LG V30 stands out from the competition enough to be considered LG’s true flagship phone for 2017, not the LG G6 , its impressive, albeit instantly outmatched smartphone from six months ago.. That’s an unexpected relief because the LG V20 came onto the scene last year and its rivals frankly picked apart everything unique it had going for it. The HTC U Ultra lifted the second screen for notifications, and just about every flagship phone now utilizes a dual-lens camera.. So how has LG’s experimental smartphone branch move forward? By focusing on the subtleties, ditching the divisive design, and producing its most bold, feature-packed device yet.. But making all of the right moves comes at a high cost. $809 in the US, £799 in the UK when it launches in November, and AU$1199 in Australia for the LG V30+ (the only model this region will be served, which differs only in its internal storage).. ( Update : Despite not having Android Oreo, the LG V30 is one of the best Android phones that you can buy, so we'd be remiss to omit that you'll be able to snag one on discount during the holiday season in the US. If you're already set on a smartphone, you can start thinking about LG's next device, the LG G7 .. Since we've reviewed the V30, LG has brought a Raspberry Red variant of the acclaimed phone to South Korea. Even if it's not globally available just yet, it was on display at CES 2018, so naturally we took some pictures of it in all its rosey glory .). That amount of money will basically get you any flagship phone on the market, or at least most of one if you’re on the hunt for the iPhone X. And for some, LG took far too long following the V30’s late August announcement to bring it to market. Since then, the Essential Phone , Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and Google Pixel 2 XL have been revealed to the world. But even with this stellar year for Android smartphones, LG’s nearly bezel-free device easily makes its case for the cash.. We’ve now spent more than enough time with the final review unit and have worked to scoop through each and every feature (there are many) to be found within LG’s latest smartphone.. For the first time, LG’s V-series smartphone will be more broadly available across the globe. Having been limited to just the US, Australia and part of Asia, the V30 is making the jump to multiple regions, including the UK.. As for the price, LG’s latest retails for $806 in the US. In the UK? Pre-orders for its early November release pin it at £799. For those in Australia, you’ll be treated only to the LG V30+ for AU$1,199 – the same goes for US customers on Sprint. In terms of differences, there are few: onboard storage and carrier compatibility (the latter of which applies if you're in the US). Instead of 64GB by default in the standard model, you’ll get 128GB built-in along with microSD storage.. Instead of straying from the pack, the LG V30 blends in with this year’s fleet of flagships. But that’s not such a bad thing. It even takes cues from the LG G6, evolving that design ID ever so slightly, all while steering itself in a few new directions, too.. Starting on the front, LG’s FullVision 18:9 aspect ratio tech is on display here, complete with a gorgeous 6-inch OLED (finally!) display tuned at 2,880 x 1,440. While there are still bezels at the ends and the sides of the V30, the presentation renders them to be quite understated, letting the screen stand at the center of the stage. In fact, we really appreciate having just a little bezel on the sides, as it lessens accidental presses while typing or playing a game.. LG’s latest measures in at 151.7 x 75.4 x 7.3mm and weighs 158 grams, all of which puts it on par in sizing with the Google Pixel XL. That said, it’s remarkable that LG has fit a screen that’s a half an inch larger inside of a chassis that’s nearly the same size. Interestingly, it’s just a bit wider than the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, though the rest of its dimensions pale in comparison.. Around its glossy steel siding, you’ll find a tactile volume rocker to the left, and a SIM and microSD tray on the right. Down below, there’s a bottom-firing speaker grill next to the V30’s USB-C charging port. Up top, there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is your one-stop shop for experiencing the phone’s Hi-Fi audio capabilities. LG has never been one to let us down in this department.. Flipped over on its slightly curved glass back, the phone’s fingerprint sensor, which doubly works as its power button, sits right in the middle – a more ergonomic location than Samsung’s choice with the Galaxy S8 and Note 8.. Glancing upward has us stumbling upon the V30’s center aligned dual-camera system. This isn’t LG’s first foray into the technology – the LG V10 was released in 2015. But this phone’s duo of lenses puts them to the best use yet. We’ll dive into that more below.. Lastly, LG has done the V30 a solid by implementing wireless charging as well as making it both water and dustproof with IP68 resistance. It also meets military spec standards, meaning it’s very durable. While this doesn’t ensure that its glass won’t break, the tough frame works to prevent bending. And for such a pretty phone, that’s a very good thing.. Unique to the V experience, up until now at least, was the second screen display. The V30 changes that staple hardware feature into a software touch called Floating Bar that looks reminiscent of Samsung’s Edge feature, but operates a bit differently.. The second screen might be gone, but it’s still here in spirit. On our preview unit, the feature was strangely not turned on by default, but when activated, it’s tucked away into the side of the screen. A simple tap opens the bar and holding on the icon lets you move it wherever you’d like.. In addition to letting you customize what sort of app or command goes into the bar slots, the feature also focuses on surfacing some of the phone’s more hidden abilities, like QuickMemo+ note-taking and capturing a picture or GIF of the screen..

The LG V30: Everything you need to know about LG’s flagship smartphone. LG to launch updated V30 with a bunch of new A.I. The LG V30 is available from AT&T starting Thursday, October 5 online , and hits the carrier’s stores on Friday, October 6. It’s $27 per month for 30 months ($810), and for a limited time, AT&T is throwing in a free LG V30 for new customers on AT&T Next with DirecTV service. T-Mobile opened pre-orders of the LG V30 October 5 online and in stores, ahead of a launch on October 13. It’s $80 down and $30 per month ($800) on T-Mobile’s Equipment Installment Plan. Verizon has the LG V30 in stores and online. It starts at $840 full retail, or $35 per month for 24 months on Verizon’s device payment plan. And for a limited time (until November 6), the carrier’s offering a $200 Visa prepaid card with the purchase of a LG V30. Sprint will be the only network in the U.S. with the LG V30 Plus, an upgraded version of the LG V30 that begins shipping October 13. The LG V30 Plus has twice the onboard memory — 128GB — as the standard LG V30. And it comes with LG’s QuadPlay earbuds included in the box, which boast frequency-boosting quad layer speaker technology and a fabric cable that minimizes digital noise. It’s $38 per month for 18 months ($684) and $0 with Sprint Flex (new customers and existing customers save $30 when they purchase it online), and for a limited time, Sprint’s offering Flex customers a second V30 Plus on lease for free. When LG released the LG V30 last year, it quickly became one of our favorite flagships. The V30 featured a dual-camera setup, class-leading processor, and an edge-to-edge OLED display.. Well, it looks like LG is looking to up the ante in 2018 with an updated V30 to be announced at this year’s MWC in just a few weeks. what we expect from Mobile World Congress , and everything we know about the LG V30.. After an LG executive announced we would see an update LG V30 at MWC 2018, the company issued a press release offering some more details. According to a report in the Korea Herald , the next V30 will be named the LG V30α. The report states the updated flagship will feature A.I. features and, quite possibly tight integration with Google Assistant, similar to the Pixel 2.. This year’s LG V30 will feature Vision AI, an augmented reality update focused specifically on the camera. Vision AI will use image recognition to help you take the perfect image. The system will analyse objects in the viewfinder before selecting from one of eight different shooting modes tailored to the most common photos.. Vision AI will also feature a recognition feature that seems very similar to Google Lens. The feature will use image recognition to conduct images searches, provide shopping information, and scan QR codes.. As was hinted at in earlier rumors, LG confirmed that the 2018 refresh of the LG V30 will be tightly integrated with Google Assistant, offering 32 exclusive commands for the phone in addition to those already available.. While we don’t have pricing details for the V30α just yet, the name of the phone may provide us with a hint. In the past, LG has used the alpha suffix on lower-priced phones. LG also announced that it would focus on controlling costs and releasing G and V model variants throughout 2018 in its recent earnings report .. It won’t be hard to find the LG V30 on launch day.. The V30 has been heavily inspired by the design of the LG G6. It features a similar “ bezel-less ” screen, with rounded corners bordering the display, and the same orientation of the dual cameras and fingerprint sensor around back. The sides are glass, which doesn’t help with durability — we cracked one while writing our LG V30 hands on — but the phone does look more polished than last year’s metallic LG V20 .. The six-inch screen features an 18:9 aspect ratio with a resolution of 2,880. × 1,440, just like the G6 — although it differs in one significant way. Whereas the G6’s panel was LCD, the V30’s is OLED. It is a new direction for LG and in line with the way the industry is heading, thanks to the technology’s ability to provide more vivid colors, including perfect blacks, and dynamically conserve battery.. It is also a departure from a trend established in previous V-series devices — the second display. and the V10 before it, the V30 does not have a “ticker” above the primary screen, beside the front-facing camera. The full-face display negates the need for it, the company claims, and it replaced the shortcuts and action previously stored there with a software solution — a floating quick actions bar that can be revealed or hidden at any time.. Beneath the glass, you will find a phone that, internally speaking, shares much with other leading Android smartphones. The V30 carries Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip, paired with 4GB of RAM. The base model offers 64GB of internal storage, though you can expand it thanks to a MicroSD slot. The battery weighs in at 3,300mAh, which is about average for its class, and there’s support for wireless charging.. One of the ways the V30 differentiates itself is in its audio system. Similar to last year’s V20, LG has fitted the V30 with an upgraded 32-bit Quad DAC system for richer, more accurate sound. We loved what we heard from the phone’s predecessor, and LG is the only mainstream manufacturer really innovating the listening experience in this way, so we hope the implementation is spot-on once again. The phone will also stream high-resolution audio in a way that conserves more data.. Sadly, the V30 won’t be the first smartphone to launch with the latest version of Android. You won’t find Android 8.0 Oreo. on the V30, but Android 7.1.2 instead. LG has confirmed it is already working on bringing the update to the V30 shortly after the phone launches. You’ll also see some new special features like Voice Imprint, which lets you unlock your phone with a pre-selected voice phrase, as well as a facial-recognition feature lets you unlock the V30 with your face. Google Assistant is also on board, and LG has worked with the search giant to offer commands tied to the cameras that only work on the V30.. Alongside the audio experience, LG invested a great deal of effort into improving the V20’s already strong camera. The V30 utilizes a similar pairing of a standard and wide-angle lens, with the former rated at 16 megapixels and the latter at 13. But the new device goes a few steps further, with an f/1.6 aperture and an f/1.9 aperture, respectively. The bigger aperture will allow more light into shots, which should especially improve images captured in dark environments. LG said it should also help reduce distortion with the wide-angle lens. At the front, there is a 5-megapixel wide-angle shooter for selfies.. LG also implemented a new technology with the V30 known as Point and Zoom. Simply tap an object on the screen and a slider will appear, allowing you to close in on that aspect of the frame first using the wide-angle lens, before switching to the normal one, and then using digital zoom. It should be a handy feature for producing fun videos. and blends the V30’s two cameras in a seamless, intuitive way. It works in a new camera mode in the V30 called Cine Video, which offers a number of color-graded themes designed around movie genres. These are added to videos before you start filming.. One of the V20’s weak points was its lack of durability. Although it complies with a variety of military standard tests, it isn’t water resistant — putting it at a disadvantage next to the Apple iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7. Part of that was due to the removable battery and back cover, which has been removed this time around. Sealing the components has allowed the V30 to achieve that IP68 rating. We feel it is a worthy trade-off.. The V30 utilizes a combination of Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5 on both sides, and Gorilla Glass 4 over the camera lenses to keep the device scratch- and shatter-free. LG also says it improved the handset’s heat management and dispersion — something phone makers do not typically point out, which is an encouraging sign..

CNET también está disponible en español.. LG V30 launch date, specs and price: Everything we know. The company's 2016 flagship was overshadowed by superior models from Apple, Samsung and Google. Can LG break through with its follow-up?. by August 31, 2017 8:44 AM PDT. Specs we expect to see on the LG V30 August 31 debut ( confirmed ) 6-inch OLED display ( confirmed ) Edge-to-edge screen with 1,440x2,880-pixel resolution Dual rear cameras with an f/1.6 aperture and glass lens ( confirmed ) Fingerprint scanner USB-C port Snapdragon 835 processor 3,300mAh battery. Amping up the camera hardware It will have a curved, edge-to-edge OLED display But the V series' distinctive second screen might go away. LG might give the V30 a premium sibling Price. Leaked photos show a V30 with elements of LG's G6 and Samsung's Galaxy S8.. Read our full LG V30 review !. Over the next four weeks, if our expectations play out, we'll see new flagships from the biggest players in the market, including Samsung and Apple , newcomers like Essential. On August 31 , LG will debut the V30, the successor to last year's competent but non-distinct V20 , at the IFA 2017 tech show in Berlin. According to Android Authority , the new phone will hit store shelves about a month later, on September 28.. The LG V20 wasn't a bad phone by any means. It just didn't deliver enough to stand out from a crowded field of excellent phones in 2016. The V30 could bring more to the table, however. Between the official details the company has announced, the leaked photos we've seen, and the rumors floating around online, LG is looking to make a bigger splash with the V30.. We should have the full scoop by the end of the month. For now, we'll keep a running list of what we know and what we're hearing below.. LG V30's f/1.6 aperture is the best ever for a smartphone. LG made the announcement date official on its Facebook page earlier in August.. LG has confirmed an August 31 debut for the V30. Android Authority has filled in some additional details , reporting that the company will start taking preorders on September 17 and shipping in the US and elsewhere on September 28.. The phone may go on sale earlier -- perhaps as soon as September 15 -- in South Korea, LG's home country. Android Authority also suggests that, unlike its predecessors, the LG V30 will be sold in Europe, though it doesn't provide any details on the time frame for that rollout.. The V series needs to step its camera game up to hang with the likes of Google's Pixel and Apple's iPhone 7 Plus , and based on the specs already announced, LG may deliver. According to the company's official statements, the V30 will once again come equipped with dual rear cameras -- the V20 was one of the first phones with two cams on the back. But LG has also equipped the V30 with a. glass lens , usually found on DSLR cameras, and an f/1.6 aperture , which it says will deliver 25 percent more light than the f/1.8 aperture found on most smartphone cameras.. LG has also confirmed that the V30 will have a " plastic OLED FullVision display ." (Apple's. forthcoming iPhone 8 , expected to debut during the first half of September, is also rumored to be equipped with OLED technology.) Apparently, LG's P-OLED configuration places pixels directly on to a plastic substrate, which the company says is stronger than the typical glass base, which is then covered over by Gorilla Glass. LG says this setup reduces burn-in and sucks less power than other OLED technologies.. In addition, we know that the phone's 6-inch display will be curved, go from edge to edge , and will have a 1,440x2,880-pixel resolution. It will not be flexible like the LG G Flex 2 , the company's previous OLED phone, but we're OK with that.. LG is rumored to have developed a premium "Plus" version of the V30.. The V series is known for its secondary display that runs atop the main screen. According to Android Authority , the company has replaced that second screen for some sort of "floating bar," which is rumored to give quick access to shortcuts and notifications. In addition to the flagship V30, LG may also launch an upgraded variant of the phone called the V30 Plus. (The company established a precedent for this sort of thing with the LG G6 Plus , which it revealed a few months after the LG G6 .) Unlike the. Galaxy S8 Plus , LG's Plus model won't be bigger -- it'll just offer more internal storage (128GB instead of 64GB), a different audio system and wireless charging, according to the report.. The LG V30 is said to cost $700 (about £540 or AU$885). The LG V30 Plus, if it's real, is rumored to start at $875 (about £670 or AU$1,105).. CNET earns fees when you click these offers..

UX 6.0+ enhancements fall short Doug Duvall/IDG. Should you buy an LG V30? Doug Duvall/IDG. When I first went hands on with the LG V30 , I was sure I had found the phone of my dreams. But that was before the Galaxy Note 8 and Pixel 2 XL had made their debuts, and LG had just fed me a feast of specs: a Snapdragon 835 chip, 1440x2880 18:19 pOLED display, Quad DAC, and a 16MP camera with a f/1.6 lens.. The LG V30’s fingerprint sensor is in the right spot.. And there it all was, packed inside a sleek frame with skinny bezels and a lot of glass, as if it were the love child of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 .. At once, the V30 seemed to be a wholesale reimagining of the V20 and a declaration that LG was finally serious about building a flagship phone free of gimmicks (the second screen) and niche features (the removable battery).. But even if LG’s timing hadn’t been doomed it from the start—the subsequent launches of the Note 8, iPhone 8 and iPhone X , and Pixel 2 have all but snatched the spotlight—the V30 still misses the mark in small but meaningful ways. Despite a couple of cool features that its higher-profile competitors are lacking (most notably a kick-ass headphone jack), ultimately the V30's legacy will be the same as the LG flagships that came before: So close. While the V30 isn’t nearly as much of a departure from its predecessor as the G6 is from the modular G5, it still brings some significant design changes. The most obvious is that there isn’t a physical second screen at the top anymore, giving the phone much better visual symmetry and balance. a bit more than last year, and the bezels have slimmed down dramatically, giving the phone a more compact look despite its larger screen (6 inches vs 5.7 inches on the V20).. The LG V30 has a big screen, but it fits comfortable in your hand thanks to its slimmer bezels.. With its new design, however, the V30 has also left behind some of the V20’s character. Where the previous model had strips of metal at the top and bottom reminiscent of the timeless HTC One , the front of the V30 is entirely made of black glass. Around the back you’ll find a dual camera setup and a centered fingerprint scanner that once again doubles as a power button. The glass backing has a metallic sheen to it that reflects the light nicely, and feels smooth without being too slippery.. The bezel-slimming movement has had the unfortunate side effect of homogenizing large handsets to the point of bring indistinguishable, however, and LG couldn't resist the trend. While there’s nothing wrong with the V30's design, there’s nothing memorable about it either. It looks like any old Android phone.. I prefer the distinguishing touches of metal in the G6 and V20.. The V30 represents LG’s first OLED phone since the ill-fated G Flex 2. The newness of the display is evident. With HDR and Daydream VR capabilities, the OLED's deep blacks and vivid hues represent an upgrade over previous generations of LG LCDs. Unfortunately, though, the deficiencies stand out more.. The LG V30 has a six-inch OLED screen, a departure from the LCD screen in previous V phones.. The “p” in pOLED stands for plastic, which is used to make the display thinner and more flexible than would be possible with glass—similar to the AMOLED screens Samsung uses in its Galaxy phones. Compared to the G6 and the V20, the V30’s curved edges are definitely a step in the right direction, but the display's not quite in the same league as the Infinity Display on the newest Galaxy handset. Plus, in my experience, it scratched way more easily than other phones despite being covered with Gorilla Glass 5.. Samsung has practically perfected its AMOLED displays with the S8 and the Note 8 , and as a result the V30’s pOLED screen feels several generations behind. In fact, colors are often a bit cooler and somewhat duller than they are on the G6. At lower brightness levels, the V30's screen is noticeably uneven, with pockets of inconsistent colors and occasional graininess. It echoes the issues some users are seeing with the Google Pixel 2 XL , which also has a display made by LG. Given the impressive track record with its LCDs, it’s a little surprising that LG’s quality control team keeps letting subpar product out the door.. What the V30 lacks in display performance, it makes up for in actual performance. The V30 sports a Snapdragon 835, along with 4GB of RAM. While the 835 is a step above the Snapdragon 820 in the V20 and the Snapdragon 821 in the G6, it's still a bit old hat by this point. Nevertheless it's very capable: Navigation and app switching is fast and smooth, and there’s a cool haptic engine that emits little pulses of feedback when you flip a toggle or snap a photo.. The LG V30 only has a 3,300mAh battery, but it’ll likely get your through the day.. LG has put a 3,300mAh battery in the V30, but this time around it’s not removable. The V20 was the last major Android phone with a removable battery, so some enthusiasts will be very disappointed. For most buyers, however, it won’t matter, especially because LG has added wireless charging and IP68 water resistance in its place.. You wouldn’t need to swap it out very often, in any case. Benchmarks were somewhat inconclusive, as PCMark’s Work 2.0 battery life test repeatedly crashed before it could tally the results. Based on my observations of the tests as they ran, however, a span of about 8.5 hours seems realistic—longer than the G6, but not quite as long as the Galaxy S8+. Most importantly, however, I never had to plug it in during a heavy load of real-world testing. The V30 should get you though a full day, but you’ll need to charge it while you sleep. You know, like pretty much every other Android phone.. While Google and Apple are leading the charge to dump the headphone jack, LG is doubling down on the legacy port by building a 32-bit advanced Quad DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) into the V30. The LG V30’s headphone jack is real... With a pair of Bluetooth buds, the V30 sounds like any other phone, but with wired headphones and the Quad DAC flipped on, it’s in a class by itself. Even comparing it against the HTC U11, which has its own USB-C-based audio system with a proprietary pair of noise-canceling earbuds, the V30 more than held its own. Once I plugged in a pair of higher-end headphones, the sound was downright spectacular for a smartphone. My only quibble is that I would have preferred the headphone jack at the bottom edge of the phone rather than the top.. With on-par performance and battery life, the V30’s Quad DAC is easily its best selling point, especially for people turned off by the Pixel 2 XL’s reliance on a USB-C-to-3.5mm dongle. In an era where specs and design are increasingly homogenous, sound quality could very well become one of the main differentiators among flagship phones. The V30 is definitely among the cream of the crop.. The V30 continues its product line's tradition of being a showcase for LG’s latest advancements in smartphone photography. The dual-camera setup pairs a 16MP lens with a 13MP one. LG has stuck with its wide-angle camera over the telephoto one on other flagship phones, so there’s still no portrait mode.. The V30 is capable of snapping some truly amazing pics.. If you’ve used an LG G6, you pretty much know what to expect with the V30’s camera. In the right light, pictures are clear and bright, and colors are vivid, though they can get a touch oversaturated at times.. Low-light performance is still very good and a step above the G6's, though I wasn’t as blown away by its f/1.6 aperture and optical image stabilization as I’d hoped. In extreme darkness, the Pixel 2 and Note 8 are far more impressive. And while autofocus is speedy in most cases, it struggles with motion, whereas the Pixel 2 are able to lock in and capture crisp, clear images of moving subjects.. The LG V30’s optical image stabalization and f/1.6 lens really help when shooting in low-light situations.. In extrememly harsh light, however, the LG V30 (left) paled in comparison to the Samsung Note 8 (center) and Pixel 2 (right).. But those are just my anecdotal observations. We're also running the LG V30 through a battery of real-world camera tests. At this point we can say that the V30 holds its own against our longtime champion, the LG G6, and even brings some notable improvements in image quality and user experience. However, the V30 struggles to match the superior image processing power of the newer Pixel 2. Stay tuned for our full camera shootout.. The LG V30 (left) couldn’t capture motion shots like the Pixel 2 (right).. While it might not be superior to its peers in terms of raw image quality, the V30 excels in giving you plenty of creativity tools. LG has expanded on the G6’s incredible camera app, keeping features like Match Shot (taking a pic with the front and rear cameras simultaneously) and Snap Shot (showing a preview of your last pic alongside the viewfinder), while also adding some cool new ones. Flip over to manual mode and you’ll see a new Graphy icon that lets you browse a library of professional photos and automatically import the same white balance, shutter speed, and ISO settings that were used to take it. You can finally learn the secret to taking perfect sunset and fireworks photos.. Cine Video and point zoom put Hollywood-style video effects in the palm of your hand.. LG has beefed up the V30’s video capabilities as well. The marquee feature is Cine Video, which offers a variety of color grades for your shot. Like lens filters for your videos, you can choose from a variety of tints, like dark-blue in Thriller or old-time black and white with Classic. Also new is point zoom, which lets you pick an area on the screen that the lens will lock into while zooming. Neither feature is particularly groundbreaking, but they go a long way toward making up for the technical issues with the camera. I might have taken consistently better photos with my Pixel 2 and Note 8, but I had way more fun taking them with the V30.. The V30 ushers in an updated version of LG’s UX OS, version 6.0+. The most notable difference is the addition of a Floating Bar that can be toggled off in the settings. A virtual representation of the V20’s second screen, it serves as a place for shortcuts and controls. Also like the V20’s second screen, it’s not very useful.. The floating bar on the V30 is a cheap imitation of the V20’s second screen.. It lives on the edge of the screen and you can move it anywhere you want, but it’s fairly limited in scope. You can show app shortcuts, a set of screen capture tools, contacts, and music controls, but not things like upcoming events and quick settings. Ultimately, I found it to be even less useful than Samsung’s Edge Panels, and I ignored the floating bar for long stretches until I finally just turned it off.. What I did like about UX 6.0+ is the new color-tinged always-on display. Previous LG always-on displays have offered little more than a clock, but the V30 brings the ability to display color photos and adds a set of useful quick controls for things like turning off Wi-Fi and turning on the flashlight. I only wish I could customize the placement and assortment of buttons.. Believe your eyes: That’s a color always-on display on the LG V30.. Among the other UX 6.0+ changes is a new biometric unlocking mechanism using your voice. Just as with “OK Google,” you can set a word or phrase that will automatically unlock your phone whenever you utter it. It worked well—so well, in fact, that a quick audio recording of me saying my unlock word also repeatedly unlocked the phone. In the age of iris scanning and Face ID, it’s an unnecessarily insecure method.. Even without last year's gimmicks, the LG V30 is still basically an Android enthusiast phone, appealing to die-hard fans who need the latest smartphone specs, and want killer audio and assortment of fun features. But its competition has only gotten tougher with the launches of Samsung's Note 8, Google's Pixel 2, Huawei's Mate 10, and Apple's iPhone 8. To get noticed, LG’s V30 would have to be nearly perfect, and it’s not. But it’s still a pretty great phone that improves upon both the G6 and the V20.. Go ahead and get it wet: The LG V30 now has IP68 water resistance.. The LG V30's outstanding sound quality and nifty camera tricks are good reasons to consider it. At $829 for an unlocked 64GB model, however, price isn’t a compelling reason to pick up the V30 over an $850 Pixel 2 XL or even the $799 iPhone 8 Plus. Neither is the screen, nor the battery.

Dual-camera with 70 degree main camera and 120 degree super wide angle. Main camera: 16MP 1/3.1" Sony IMX351 CMOS sensor, F1.6 aperture, OIS. Super-wide-angle: 13MP Samsung sensor with 1.0um pixel size, F1.9 aperture. 6" QHD+ (1440 x 2880) OLED FullVision display. The LG V30 is the Korean manufacturer's latest flagship smartphone and offers a dual-camera setup that combines a main camera with a 71-degree angle of view with a secondary 120-degree super-wide angle lens. On the main camera, a Sony IMX 351 1/3.1" sensor is coupled with a very fast F1.6 lens.. The super-wide-angle lens, by contrast, comes with a smaller Samsung sensor that features a 13MP resolution and 1.0um pixel size. There is an F1.9 aperture but no OIS, which is easier to live without on a super-wide-angle anyhow.. The V30 sets itself apart from the competition with a comprehensive video mode that provides manual control over shutter speed and sound recording levels, among many other parameters. You can also choose from 15 new Cine Effect color presets that are based on film genres and the Point Zoom mode allows for stable zooming into a target in the frame rather than the center.. Images and videos can be viewed on the phone's 6" QHD+ OLED HDR FullVision display with a 18:9 aspect ratio that occupies almost the entire front of the device's dust and water sealed metal body. Read on to find out how the V30's impressive specs translate into real-life camera performance.. DPReview smartphone reviews are written with the needs of photographers in mind.

Owner of a V30 here and yes I agree the default camera app is average at best... Now, if only you can have google's awesome HDR+ image processing?... well now you can, Thanks to cstark27 in the xda forums, there is a Google Camera Mod that you can install without root etc... the pictures are night and day compared to the standard app... and you can use both lenses, not just the regular one....check it out!. Not a big fan of their (LG's) removing the second screen. LG used to have very good cameras in the previous models. Now look at this paintings! Is this a kind of filter applied to the JPEGs? Look at the leaves... it retains the sd slot and audio port. lg didnt have an sd slot in the v10 ... but having respect for the consumer ...saw the desire for the option at minimium ... absolutely no reason exists to leave this feature off and as a media repository 400 gb can be added for 249 usd....wow!!. The other commendable thing is the retention of the worldwide standard the audio port... as the water resistance for this phone is class leading despite keeping the audio port and sd slot, the corporate lie, that abandoning these standards increases water resistance, has been revealed. seems to be a habit] The audio port will be used by every user at some point as %100 Bluetooth readiness over a years usage is improbable.. unexpected dead wireless earbuds are going to happen once in a Bluetooth moon....will you be digging for a dongle like pixels require ? not with LG. the iq is great if i ever use a camera phone this would be a good start. Any one know what the statue of the third image from the gallery represents?. Looks like you guys like Madrid.😁. Loved my v10 till it died. The replacement V20 gives me better sound stage, better image quality and an option of having a SD card slot, infrared remote and replaceable battery. V30 bests V20 by having water proof body, much longer battery life and much lighter weight.. Seems like this has Hi-FI DAC. The G6 did not have that. But is it worth extra 500 euro for Hi-FI DAC? One can get Hi-FI DAC player between 100 and 350 euro.. I am totally disguisted with this new generation cameras quality. It started with G5 continued with G6 V20 all through Leicas Huawei Mate 10PRO and likes. That oversharpening and total denoising is just ugly. Typical smartphone as most of us knew and probaly hate from the past. I have LG V10 my wife LG G4 and there is no comparison in detail, crispness, fine textures definition (leafes, grass etc.). RAW from V30 is comparable with JPG from V10 - but not completely. I would like to change my V10 for something newer however not this picture mess. the google camera app (port for non-pixel phones) makes amazing quality photos, like it was processed from raw. i am extremely impressed by how well it works for my lg g5, although it only works with main camera (no wide angle support) and it only saves to internal camera memory (no SD card support). plus it's a hack version made by unknown developers so no guarantees about its safety.. but anyway it can be amazing especially with regards to sharp yet natural-looking output. Sorry, but where is the iPhone X camera review? Your email newsletter that brought me here said “With all the hoopla about Google's Pixel and the tenth iteration of a certain fruit-based device” so I’d assume that all the hoopla would mean you’d have a god solid pro viewpoint on the iPhone X, the first iPhone to have OIS on the 56mm lens. I’ve found this makes a huge difference to low light shots.. Anyway, can’t find a review of it on here.. I can only assume DPreview is anti-Apple as you don’t even mention the device’s name but call it a fruit-based device, even though you acknowledge there is must hoopla about it, and the Pixel, which you do call out by name.. I’ll still come here for the real camera reviews, I love my Fuji gear - but the smartphone side is seriously lacking if you place importance on reviewing any LG phone over the Samsung and Apple flagships first.. DPR owned by AMAZON where does not sale iPhone.. Not sure it is the reason.. " if you place importance on reviewing any LG phone over the Samsung and Apple flagships first" Really? You should Google "LG V30" first, a lot of photographers, and video guys prefer LG V20, and LG V30 is one of their dream over Samsung Phone. LG V series is designed photo/videography. Samsung designed for people who have time to hack and root their phone :D, and Apple designed for people who don't know how to spend their money.. Why do the image comparison's on GSM Arena's studio shots of the V30 look worse than the iPhone 8, Note 8, and Pixel 2 then? Very aggressive noise removal and lack of detail as a result.. In these cell phone camera reviews it would be nice to have tables with comparisons to previous versions of this phone on the first page like you often do with new camera bodies.. I am trying to decide if paying double for the v30 vs a v20 for my kids is worth it when considering camera and audio capabilities and this review is not helping me make that comparison.. Based on specs and hype I had high hopes for this phone camera and its packaging vs. the too easy to break and too hard to protect samsung s8 plus or note.. B and H has lots of owner reviews of the V20. Put the phone in a decent case can help with the shock proof aspect. I bought the V20 at BandH.com and its case on Amazon.. Not sure whether V20 is based on LG G5 or G6 (I presume the first), but optically the G5 differs from G6 by having a 130 degree super wide angle, instead of 120 on the G6. My main pet-peeve with the otherwise fantastic optics (btw, G6/V30 increased resolution with the superwide-angle (8 vs 13MP):. Other than 1 single exception (Open Camera), I have *yet* to find an app that also utilises the secondary camera (might also happen with those other brands/models with secondary tele-lens?). Really wish Ultimate HDR could do this.... (although having something similar to the magnificent Casio HDR-Art would be even better). Oh, Open Camera, despite its settings, doesn't want to perform AEB with 5 shots, +/-3EV (should generate a total of 12EV, but it only does 4 (based on +/- 1EV)). Panorama is also not as stable/foolproof as with Casio (but Panasonic FZ72 isn't either (even though that one does a much larger swing than both)). "but optically G5 differs from G6 by having a 130 degree super wide angle, instead of 120 on the G6.". I think the wide angle difference is caused by sensor format, G5 is 16:9 and G6 is 4:3, so it makes G5 wider. I have G5, but it is not as wide as G6 while print with 4:3.. I bought G5 is not because I need another phone, but for UWA with my Panasonic ZS100 while traveling, but DR from G5's UWA cam's sensor is toooo poor while certain scenic need better DR range.. It’s as though LG is using a lot of noise reduction, and then trying to boost sharpness up again afterwards. It’s worse than it should be in outdoor, bright pictures, but also really bad in low light. Look at the pic of the people looking at the art of the heads. Sharpening artifacts are super easy to see there around all contours, but particularly around the heads.. And this is in small, crappy, low res files on the site. I shudder to think of how bad it is in a larger size. LG has not given good photos since, well, forever.. Obviously you never used an LG V10. I still use it today to back up my SLR with exceptional results.. Oh jeez, it’s NOT water or dustPROOF. How many times do we have to go over this? When are “technical” writers going to learn their subject? This is very basic. There is almost nothing that is waterproof.. My old Omega diving Watch was water resistant to 1,200 meters. Just like these phones are water resistant to about 1.5 meters. They are NOT guaranteed against water incursion.. AFAIK, it's IP67, which is about the limit you'll find in consumer products. (don't expect any salesman to know about IP68, or even IP69 (high-pressure waterproof, including rotating nozzle (which is particular agressive, rattling the seals, if present)). Better change to some exotic MIL-spec's if you want to be picky like this....;)). It's IP-rating actually means that it has too be waterPROOF to a certain depth and for a certain duration.. LG's phone OLED screens are garbage, give this and the Pixel 2 XL a wide berth. Not sure why their small screen OLED is so poor compared to their TV OLED.. What a low energy, lackluster, modane review. Does not seem like a lot of thought or ambition was put into this review at all - just sort of going through the motions. I have tried the top camera phone side by side and they are all very good and very close in performance. The review just does not come across as very genuine.. What exactly is it that you are missing in the review?. This article sums up your review. what an excellent link ... imagine not reviewing the x in a vacuum but comparing and contrasting with another flagship...genius.... the Forbes article raises the question of why so many give the iphone so many passes for its faults so perfectly covered in the forbes article. why pundits seem to be apologists for apple phones gushing over them in such an undignified manner ..... for me the answer is media was never there to inform you ..... they are there to spin you a tale. I was ready to get the V30 but choked when I saw its price. So, I just now ordered the unlocked V20 from BandH.com It will be a quantum jump from my 5 year old Samsung, that's for certain. Note that that site is running a special deal till Dec 2. Buy the V30 and get up to a $400 rebate on the purchase of another LG phone.. enjoy your excellent phone and dont forget to soup it up with a huge sd card. 200 gb and 256 are both pretty cheap now..... while most people enjoy phones as a GP computer and internet portal .... my personal focus is on "media server" and media caster for tv i use an 8 inch win tablet for computer needs on the road it all take up very little room in my small backpack. and ...well ...a real camera too either a small ricoh \ fuji x30\20\ gm5\x100. anyway enjoy that nice v20 tis a fine machine at a sane price. The V20 is in some ways better anyway - replaceable battery (either keep multiple OEM batteries or just get a huge one from ZeroLemon), second screen on the top is actually quite useful for performing tasks like controlling music or entering frequently used applications directly, etc. I will check out that dual screen and that big battery from ZeroLemon. The V20 for me and the G5 for the wife should get here today, I got the cases and belt holster for the V20 already. I have never had a speedy phone before. My old Samsung Centura is painfully slow and very small in size and performance wrt the camera. I got to get the tiny SD's for the two new phones yet. This one looks good: SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO UHS-I SDXC Memory Card (V30) for $129.50 at BandH.com. a week ago it was or a similar sized card 256 was 99 but a couple of months ago it was 200 i missed out even 129 is a good price .... ive been using the 200 gb with regularity and have 3 getting it once ofr 49 usd at bh on sale. SanDisk 200GB Ultra UHS-I microSDXC Memory Card (Class 10) today is 76.99 which is good. I am shopping for a new phone and tracking this V30 parallel to Pixel2 and S8 for some time. The V30 can make decent pictures and movies, and the next big plus from my perspective is a built in hardware, for a DAC, that means pre-amp for headphones and full bouquet music listening overall. Got myself the audi a4S, lets call it a very decent car...a well dressed up german engineering. But usb connected any ordinary cellphone sounds like a rusted pail. I tried many phones borrowed from friends, no matter iphones or droids, altering the sound with apps won't move the sound quality away from a junk. So, back to story, sitting in an office or at home with headphones on or connected to a power hifi system, or sitting in a car for hours and streaming the favorite music with full dynamics, and suddenly running into unexpected scenes and making movies or pictures along my routes...with just a single cellphone? Well, I see all these features are decent enough quality and can float my boat.. The V20 has that DAC too, that's why I got it, plus the price was good. My next buy will be the Oppo PM-3 headset, planar magnetic and efficient which should be a good match.. For my the super Wide(r) Lens in the LG 5 is a reason not to upgrade.... I have a V20 ,,,, There were none of the usual frustrations and disappointments with it .. Obviously I'm not upgrading, but it the V30 would be the first place I would look if I was.... The V20 has a very similar wide vs zoom dual cam and I find this a perfect compromise.... The only issue is the lag when switching ..... I wonder if that got reduced in the V30. LG phones are really catered to my style of use .... microSD is a requirement and the V20 and 30 have it. LG seems to know how to do microSD as I have had no issues with errors or card dropouts .... not one in 8 months with a 128GB card. Quick charging is pretty standard but LG has a good implementation of it.. My V20 has a removable battery ..... I doubt the V30 does ...... I prefer removable but the Li-ion tech is getting so much better that usually your phone dies or is subject to a calamity before the battery dies.... The V30 is weather sealed ..... I wonder how you get the microSD card in ? Same way as a SIM I guess.. For the V20 at least, the designers are quite good at adding features and actually making them useful like the dual screen.. The camera is great on the V20 but like every smartphone it isn't even close to a cheap m4/3 camera. With a smartphone you either find a picture or not .... with a m4/3 camera or better you can often make a picture.. the fingerprint sensor on my V20 is so close to perfect that I sometimes forget I even have one ..... I just pick the phone up that way.. Yeah, I just got my V20. Obviously much cheaper than it was a year ago when it was the latest thing. Removable battery, MIL-STD-810G transit drop compliance rating, second screen, SD card slot and even a good old fashioned FM receiver chip are what attracted me -- dual cameras are nice, but laser focus assist and OIS are more important to me. I just unlocked the Bootloader and installed debloated ROM.. The V30's battery is not user removable. But to offset that, LG has put in a P-OLED screen that was introduced in the G6. Also many other features were added. I bought the V20 this go-round since it has that DAC, and it does work very well indeed. BTW, the DAC isn't activated until headphones are plugged in. That DAC, and V20's far cheaper price were what clinched the deal for me.. with a good set of earphones the V20 is great for listening to music.... I got an old set by Bose that sounds decent but I will replace it with the PM-3, planar magnetic, by Oppo as soon as I can. Now I got to figure out how to activate the FM radio chip that's supposed to be aboard.. I hope you don't have the Verizon version, as apparently the LG V20 Verizon (VS995) has its FM chip deactivated. Only the T-Mobile and AT&T V20's have it working.. You need to have headphones attached as that is the antenna. It is an unlocked version, 996, but I don't see anything in Settings about the radio but I downloaded Nextradio from Google Play and it seems to be working A-Ok. So, it seems to be a hidden feature but it apparently is activated now. Now I got to play with the cameras so they become second nature, like my Canon M5.. Update: I turned off the router's access point and after a 2 second delay the "radio" went quiet. So, the Nextradio seems to be faking it. It does a prelim search for local stations and so it makes it appear that it's working over the airwaves. So, that hidden radio chip is still untouched.. If your rooted and have twrp you can flash this zip,. If the FM application isn't in your app drawer .... that means the ROM flashed to your phone is from a country that has issues with it and removed it ..... If you flash a international version it should be there .... The chip is aboard according to the Nextradio site. Unless LG issues a firmware update, I think rooting is the only option. Otherwise the chip is out of reach of any app. So, I will be looking at rooting and see if it's worth the effort. I sure don't want to make the phone into a paperweight.. Unlocking the bootloader, gaining root access and installing a custom recovery -- TWRP -- is a little drawn out. I used the 'Dirty Santa' method. It's pretty safe though, so the risk of bricking your phone is pretty remote.. I've seen a couple of videos on Youtube stating there is now an 'improved' method for rooting the 996, but I used the Dirty Santa method.. EwanMC: You still got Wi-Fi working afterwards? I was looking at Weta. It seemed promising especially as he (Mentalmuso) is concentrating on audio and stability. But then he says "might lose Wi-Fi" after installing his Rom in my phone's firmware base, US996. Also, is that FM chip working for you now? after using Dirty Santa? If anyone finds a safe way to activate the FM chip, please put it here. It does look like there's no 100% safe way to do it. BTW, being able to remove bloatware is a big plus of rooting too. I will take a look at that method.. Install this ROM, it runs absolutely perfectly on my LG V20 H910, especiaally after flashing the v5.5 update file.. [US996][ROM + Kernel] NRD90M Modded NotSoStock ROM v5.5 1/5/2017. I used to root all my phones ..... with the V20 there just wasn't enough non-removable, non-hidable bloat to annoy me into rooting. Hmm, well for me it's about practicability when I can't take a real camera, and that means facebook at 1080, youtube etc.. Even the wide-angle does a good enough job for the indoor low-light resized down to 1080. And the station video was good too.. A winner...if I was looking for wide-angle. I really think in terms of portraits, but maybe I should get over myself and reserve that to the real camera.. I would like to see more RAW examples, I have LG-G6 and the difference between JPEG to RAW is huge sometimes. I have few examples of processed RAW images with Lightroom in full size here and I am not very strong in PP area :) I think that those examples shows good and useful results regarding that this is smartphone. Why did you put this statement on the first page of the review? "DPReview smartphone reviews are written with the needs of photographers in mind. We focus on camera features, performance, and image quality.". I really don't think you're telling the truth with that statement. Where is the specifications page, like you have on the second or last page of almost every review of professional cameras? You don't even have the specs. I want to know what maximum capacity Micro-SD card it can take and things like how much RAM it has and the minimum and maximum configurations (if it has optional versions that have more memory in them). What is the street price? You give this information for cameras normally - why not for this phone?. Here's an example of where you give this info.. You could easily get the specs. and its retail price of about $840 right here: http://www.lg.com/us/mobile-phones/v30/specs#video. It's $819.99 at B&H - https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1357369-REG/lg_lgus998_ausasv_lg_v30_us998_64gb.html. I see you did include the RAM and storage specs. I don't know how I missed that. BTW, for anyone who is interested, the charging/data port is USB-C.. We include the key specs of any smartphone on the first page of the review. If you need details about things like Wifi-standards, communication bands etc you can find all those on mobile specific sites, we are focusing on the camera of course.. As a landscape photographer, this is the only phone I would ever consider using as complement to my photographic activity, as a way to create behind the scenes shots and small clips. And why do I say this? Because in the same way that a ultra wide angle lens is absolutely essential to me, and used 90% of the time, the same would obviously apply to a smartphone. There's no point in having higher image quality if I can't properly show the scene to my viewers. I would love to see a different jpg processing engine, but right now I'm quite happy with processing the RAWs with Snapseed.. G5/V20 is 130 degrees, G6/V30 is 120....;)). If only there was also more than one aftermarket app that can also utilise this secondary lens.... (thusfar I only found Open Camera....my other favorite, Ultimate HDR, has no lens-switching option) (while Open Camera fails in it's AEB setting of 5x +/-3EV....should generate 12EV, but only manages 4 (5x +/-1EV)). I do not feel the need for an aftermarket app because the native G6 camera app is one of the best I've seen, with full manual controls.. This device was on the list of possible phones to get for me.. Please also feature some more in depth reviews of the screens - they are part of the experience using the phone as a camera device. I nearly bought a Samsung S8+ phone and luckily got to see it first. What looked to be a wonderful screen turned into myself being appaled by the rounded screen edges: (Samsung S8 Users dont read this. you will hate it) They are constantly showing blue shifts on light pictures / backgrounds and distorting pictures at those edges. (the latter was to be expected.. thinking about it being an AMOLED screen the former too). all I see looking at that scren is the discolorations at those edges. To see more distinctly see it activate AMLOD picture mode in the settings (whichs btw to my mind excellently calibrated). The negative edge effect tends to be slightly hidden by the default blue tinted default color mode. you might never be fully happy with the device again. I think the panorama mode is spherical, the mode I never use in PS...This is basically useless unless you really really know what you're doing...or you have no idea at all what you're doing but you're fine with that nontheless.. there is a standard panorama mode and a spherical one...the latter probably based on Google's version.. Has any of you found an aftermarket panorama app that uses the secondary superwideangle lens? Even for HDR-Art I haven't found one (otherwise quite happy with Ultimate HDR).. Only twin-compatible aftermarket app thusfar (non-panorama, non-HDR), is Open Camera. (but it sadly fails with its AEB setting of 5x +/-3EV; result is only 4EV (5x +/-1EV), while it should be 12.. Worst image quality I've seen from a recently released smart phone. The water colour effect is evident even at normal viewing, and even in the videos. I guess this is due to having a smaller sensor size than other recent smart phones.. it is signature of lg phones. That is no signiture of LG phones because LG G4, LG V10 have very good IQ.. Don't know what they're thinking...1/3.1" and the wide angle even smaller. It creates bad results if you let it go crazy with the noise reduction and oversharpening. But if you control it manually the results are excellent. The HDR results are very good too.. I would really like these camera phone reviews to have the same studio scene test as every other camera. We could then compare different models, and even compare them against some compact cameras.. Michael! Exactly! That is the reason for this site to exist!. Where is the detailed RAW / DNG output comparison or analysis? What about analysis of the "log" format the LG V30 shoots in terms of quality & post-processing latitude?. Nice site....change my user name on me but I can't.....really nice site. Given the puny size of these sensors, I am continually impressed with the output of recent smart phones.. Separately, it would be very helpful to see your Studio Scene Comparison Tool used for this and other cameras in its class (8 Plus, X, Pixel 2, Note 8) so we could really see the differences. Isn't that the reason you created the tool to begin with?. We now take (low-light) images that were totally impossible even 5 years ago, not to mention 10. Especially video is baffling, down to candle-light. The real agony is having made overland expedition trips of a lifetime, 10 years ago. (when even the pro-videographer still used tapes, and not even HD-resolution). Image quality is useless for any serious project. Every 3 MP camera (Y2000) doing better.. A photography platform (like DPR?) should skip all that smartphones.... Smartphones can have excellent cameras, and they are beginning to dominate photography, except at the professional level. They are the cameras that are always there. Except for dark scenes for noise makers that some people think are music.. However, they dominate the world of (mostly) frivolous snaps.. A cellphone pics and video have a place. A cellphone captured a grainy video of a seaplane losing its wing and crashing on Miami Beach. That person made plenty of money on it. It was the only video available and the media and the FAA wanted that video. A co-worker made over $10,000 on photos she made with her cellphone. A News worthy event and the only pics available at the time....news media paid her $10,000 for the pics.. they dominate photography like disease dominates a sickened organism. even photo competitions have dumbs down their expectations and winners to make themselves relevant to this lessened photography that is taking over and "democratizing" it in this new simpler, less thinking world. people only want instant this and automatic that .... computational bokeh is all vaguely artificial, overprocessed, oversharpened, over noise reduced, i really believe people who really care about shooting well should carry a small camera with a larger sensor,, a 2\3,, 1inch or,,, 4\3 sensor is readily available with realy tiny cameras like fuji x30 sony rx100 or a gm1 or gm5 the small canon compacts ect. An excellent photo is an excellent photo. The only thing that matters is the aesthetic response of the viewer. The viewer does not care what tools were used to create an image.. I recently spoke to a woman who is buying the iPhone X because she always carries her phone with her (she has a point).. I would also comment that I am intending to do a pinhole project.. Photography is money or just great pics. Amateur or Pro...you strive to create great photography,. I disagree, I think that image quality of smartphones is getting better every year, especially if you use RAW, that given in flagship smartphones. You can look at this album of mine, the pictures from my LG-G6 taken in RAW and were edited with Lightroom and saved as JPEG's. You can see the 100% file, it is not DSLR but it is very surprising quality for such small sensor. Give smartphones a break ..... smartphone pictures probably dominate ALL others by several 100 times ...... In good light, low contrast scenarios with no crop the pictures aren't bad as long as you don't pixel peep. if you have the discipline and the need for a better non overprocessed image than the dismal output of a cell phone then a small compact is always with you too .... deciding that a cell phone is good enough is a personal choice .... if you decide to have a tiny capable real camera with you always ... then they are always with you too. not having a camera ever unless you break out the dslr isnt an excuse its a life choice and a very poor one. folks who say the cell phone is the camera always with you ...have made the choice that that the camera they always have with them. its a terrible self fufilling prophesy. OK, but if I'm wearing a suit (I don't mean photographing a formal function), I'm not carrying a DSLR.. How's that not getting any image working out for you?. There seems to be a hell of a lot of snobbery going on in the camera community. I can't wait until I start shooting large format again, just so I can look down my nose at the lot of you people who use miniature formats.. You are quite passionate about cell cameras .... yes I do agree that the output is pretty crappy.. The cell phone may be the greatest Trojan Horse in the history of mankind .... I don't blame you for your reservations...... It a leash, its Big Brother, it a porn and gambling gateway you can't escape from, it mesmerizing, it talks to you, it listens to you and transcribes to text in real time, it thinks for you, it tells you what to do and when ....... An YES is a camera that captures smeary processed images ..... a perfect synopsis and all human culture art and craft and mental effort are the gates of troy. James, you say smartphones will never dominate photography. Do smartphones provide the best image quality vs a professional camera? Absolutely not. But for many people that are more than enough, and improving every year. Recently on a hot and terrible day I went for a walk with my daughter, with her old my shoulders. Then we stopped at a playground. I didn’t have my X-T1 and 56mm f1.2 lens with me. We were just out for a walk. I did snap a couple of pics, including this one, with my iPhone, because that’s what I had with me. https://www.dropbox.com/s/b6pogbm7of7b10y/Photo%2011-11-17%2C%202%2038%2029%20pm.jpg?dl=0 How is that a bad thing? It’s saved as a format where I can turn off the depth stuff afterwards if I didn’t like it. But it’s not too terrible here. Would I have got a better shot with the X-T1? Absolutely possible, except my daughter does react differently to it. And I talk about having a camera with you in the first place.. I present to you tropical China, heat-index 45C and over.. There is no f*cking way I would even consider taking with me any camera(strap) that touches my upper torso, not to mention a camera bag....would create a neverending soaking sweat spot. (and for all of which a waterproof smartphone is very nice to have anyway (had my G5 in a very thin document-pouch, inside leg-pocket, kind of 'sweat-proofing' it....:)). while i applaud LGs decision to respect the consumer reality of headphone jack and sd card ubiquitous user base and not shove some new absurd listening reality as google phone and apple iphone do , i must criticise the 800 dollar price point its just a phone,ok? it has a crap camera in it like every other phone, currently.uses apps\games like every other phone,makes calls\uses internet like every phone,& in a yr or 2 it will be another old hat you'll toss in the drawer, just nonsense today B&H has a daily deal that offers,for instance,an LG V5 for $199 usd specs? hmm,lets see: 4 GB,Snapdragon 820,2.15GHz Kryo Dual-Core+1.6 GHzryo Dual-Core,GPU Adreno 530 32 GB 5.3" screen, 2560x1440 554 ppi ,IPS LCD7 Gorilla Glass 4 headphone jack? check. SD support? check [add 256gb sd \$99 also b&h]. 292 gb phone of great build for [199 +99] $298usd https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=256%20gb%20sd&N=0&InitialSearch=yes&sts=ma&Top+Nav-Search=. 800?900?1300$ for a phone? its stupid period. the lg g5 is on special for a very short time https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1239313-REG/lg_lgrs988_ausatn_g5_rs988_32gb_smartphone.html. its very nicely speced add 256 gb for 99 bucks https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1265042-REG/sandisk_sdsquni_256g_an6ma_256gb_ultra_uhs_i_microsdxc.html. I bought my V20 used ..... I agree 800-1600$ is a bit much but if you consider what you are getting and actually use it ..... My smartphone replaces 20 to 30 devices and services I had ...... Also remember the mobility of the smartphone also costs .... These phones are almost doorstops without a mobile connection .... sure you can go to Starbucks ... but that isn't really mobile is it?. The Internet is most useful when you are engaged in real time doing real things in the world. That is almost priceless then you learn to use it skillfully.. the usage experience of a lg 4gb 32 plus 256 gb phone that has sd support headphone jack 4 GB, Snapdragon 820,2.15GHz Kryo Dual-Core+1.6 GHzryo Dual-Core,GPU Adreno 530 5.3" 2560x1440 554 ppi screen ,IPS LCD7 Gorilla Glass 4 is every bit as good and likely better than what many are using for the tasks you mentioned. use the 700 dollars left over to but a real camera like a ricoh gr apsc 18mm prime $559 https://www.adorama.com/ircgr2n.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAxuTQBRBmEiwAAkFF1n9oinXM8OeRdLDvZvRCRAlsZ1Hhcj-Vl2b6lfyrMPhBNxkyRQUWiBoCOd0QAvD_BwE. use the rest for a few nice dinners and a movie. totally agree it's a phone for god's sake. In fact this review attempts to pan this machine by not letting you download the RAW files!! Imagine it being a Sony A7RIII type camera: there would be howls of anger and REAMS of complaints!!. As every cellphone photo so far that I've seen: Great for Instagram, a horror when viewed at 100%. I am super happy to have bought a Mavic pro at your recommendation instead of a jpeg-only-Spark.. As someone who owns an LG G4, it should be said that these jpeg still samples are still (unfortunately!) typical of the marque, and give no idea of the results to be had by simply setting it to use RAW files all the time instead.. Why they produce these dreadful oversharpened noise-reduced blocky jpegs, rather than leaving them unsharpened and with little or no noise reduction is a mystery to me- but then I dont post fast online!! which is I believe, why they do it. As the lens is as good as the G4 and the sensor its equal RAW stills will be as good. Just forget Panoramas-that suffer the same humiliating treatment, and HDR jpegs-where even in pic one the disappearing tree branch above the water should cure you of the temptation even to try. AS it has about the best video and sound, plus an FM steroeo radio that records (? check area etc) with the RAW files used always its possibly the best phone- but not for panoramas (try an old S6 Sammy). Any of the almost $1,000.00 smartphones are too expensive for me, for what it is.. And what's with the all glass trend?. Checkout OnePlus 5T....almost can match the iPhone X specs....for half the price $590.00 with 128 mb storage.. Checkout OnePlus 5T....almost can match the iPhone X specs....for half the price $599.00 with 128 mb storage.. Would not ever buy another LG phone again. Had two nexus 5x both had the boot loop error ( known LG fault) despite being being within the two year guarantee period lg refused to repair. How does It sack up against an iPhone 8+? Is I compatible with late model iPads?. A cellphone is not a Swiss Army Knife. The smartphone is way more than a Swiss Army knife. It is perhaps the single device that man has invented which has almost infinite uses.. My phone controls my house, monitors it remotely, and controls access to it; it gives directions, finds restaurants and gas stations; orders food; purchases almost anything; makes payments; deposits cheques; tracks shipments; it books flights, hotels and cars; it records my trips; it calls help in emergency; it communicates by audio, video, email and messages; plays games, video, music, audio books; tracks my health; takes photos and videos, and controls my other equipment (DSLRs and drones) that take photos and video; edits my photos; shares my photos and videos; tracks and notifies me of my schedules; wakes me up; updates me about the people I care; etc, etc, etc.. All of those and more from a device that fits in my pocket and is with me or within my reach all the time. For all it does and is capable of, it is almost a bargain at any price.. Yes, it does all that...all the stuff that I managed to do waaaaay back in the 70s and 80s all on my own with a home phone and a postman.....and a brain. And I still do all that with little effort. It has become a device that tries to do too much. It has allowed people to let it take over their lives. But personally I don't need one. Believe it or not, I still use a flip phone that only makes calls. I use a couple of different cameras for photography (Nikon P900 and Canon 6D). Covers all my personal photography needs and all my communication needs. I am loving still living in the last century with my old phone!. Are you telling us that in the 80s you are able to tell which gas stations have the cheapest price at any time? And that you have a daily-updated map of any place? That you can know what is happening in your house remotely? By your claim that you still use a flip phone, I can understand how you have zero idea of how powerful and multi-use the smartphone is.. Oh, and by your flawed logic, why even use a camera? In the past, people have been capturing images by painting.. This thread is about whether or not the smartphone is of very limited use like a spork.. No mentioning that V30 is the first smartphone that has 10-bit sensor in it? Are the still raw files 10-bit as well?. Anyway, I'm very happy with the camera of my current LG G4 which I have been using for a couple of years now. Its camera has fantastic sharpness with 16 MPix sensor and the low light performance is superb. Also I like the 16:9 aspect ratio of the sensor which makes sense on a smartphone. Why all phone camera sensors are nowadays 4:3? I wish someone would make a proper camera phone with larger sensor size and 16:9 aspect ratio.. "The V30 is also preserves" I guess that's American English ? :). Actually, DpReview is very much a British site, originally HQ'd in London, but recently moved to Seattle. Though currently in Seattle, their writers are very British, and their English is very much British English; not American English. Secondly, I presume that the quoted grammatical error is not poor British English, but rather poor proofreading by DPReview staff. I am going to blame it on google android. Their auto spell check on my phone is too sensitive and finish with other words while i type... Which is why I have auto spell checking turned off. When I had it on I spent more time correcting it's mistakes than I did typing my message.. I believe the trend of throwing out the "from" following words like "save", "prevent" and such is British. So can you make cinematic movies with this? Ah sorry, of course only IPhone X can make "cinematic" movies, right?. pssst! lg did not pay for advertising. no point, they cant say it without money being handed.. love my lg v30 by the way.. How can you love it when you can't even take "cinematic" movies :). During photography, iPhone snaps focus very quickly. When shooting video it does a much slower, “cinematic” style focus pull. Should this be a setting? Yes. Can you override this with more pro oriented camera apps? Yes. FiLMiC Pro by FiLMiC Inc https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/filmic-pro/id436577167?mt=8. You can see the results in Youtube video 'LG V30 vs. $50,000 RED Weapon - Replicating the Walter Mitty Longboard Scene'. I have and love the LG V30 +. ...but one correction, it’s all glass on metal frame....with glass on front and back.... It's a real shame that LG has decided that marketing the lens is more important than specifying a proper sensor.. Since the LG G4, the main camera specification has gotten progressively worse. The LG G4 had a very good sensor, and was arguably the best camera phone on the market during its availability. The same can definitely not be said of the G5, G6, and V30.. Smartphone camera sensors have gotten larger, but are now getting smaller again, I don't think any mainstream flagship except Pixel 2 still uses a 1/2.3" sensor.. V10 was even slightly better (I have both G4&V10) but then - totally agree - they went downhill.. Having bought a LG G6 after 2 years with a Samsung S6 I can only say that my ideal phone would be a wide anlge lens paired with a 50mm equivalent and the image quality of a Samsung Note 8 or Google Pixel. The LG is very unreliable in auto, especially in dark conditions and HDR. The latter is just terrible, mushy. Even at ISO 50 and bright light there is often a lot of noise in the sky and very overprocessed and oversharpened images. I much prefered the ol S6 in that regard.. But the V30 images with the WA lens look much better, I have to say. So I could sell my G6 which suffered terrible loss in value for maybe 250-300€ and pay 800€ for a V30. The way these LG phones depreciate is another reason to avopid them in the future. 100€ per month for the first 4 months is beyond normal.. I have the S6, 3 years and still pretty reliable except for the broken OIS that sometimes also affects AF. And the automatic shadow pull (vignette removal) for JPG gets pretty ugly at night.. Lackluster HDR would hardly be a problem, if there were aftermarket apps using the secondary wide-angle lens. Thusfar I have only found Open Camera doing that; non-HDR, non-panorama. (while its AEB fails in 5x +/-3EV, not getting 12EV, but only 4). If anyone finds any, please tell. (Ultimate HDR does a nice job in the HDR-Art/-Painting category (but something like Casio's HDR-Art would be much better (like its panorama, totally foolproof, no matter which speed & direction)). These used to be the phones of choice for serious phone photography but, other than some decent low light results, the images and videos here are really poor. It has a lot of great manual controls but what's the use if the results are so poor?. I fully expect it will die like my last 2 G4 phones. (I didn't get the usual boot loop. I had wifi and bluetooth die). I won't buy another LG phone. It's better than my much older Galaxy S4, and for a while it had what many considered the best camera. But things have gotten much worse at LG. And at the prices being charged for flagship phones, I was out anyway.. Have your say: Best smartphone of 2017.

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The LG V30 sports a number of impressive premium features, but the company has paid extra attention to the quality of the phone’s audio setup. Just like last year’s V20, there’s a mysterious Quad-DAC onboard promising a superior listening experience, along with high quality Bluetooth streaming, new voice recording capabilities, and a selection of new software options.. LG’s V series has built a solid reputation among the smartphone audiophile crowd, so here’s a closer look at what’s on offer for the audio enthusiast with this year’s V30 release.. Starting with the most sought after requirement for music and audio enthusiasts, high fidelity playback. For those still listening over a wired connection, the LG V30 sports another 32-bit Quad DAC in place of the built in Snapdragon SoC solution – this time in all global markets. Ignoring that “32-bit Quad” marketing jargon for a minute, the DAC chip isÂ. ESS Technologyâs ES9218P , a familiar chip in LG’s recent flagships.. Functional Block Diagram for the ES9218P. The chip features stereo quad parallel delta sigma converter channels with a 32-bit interpolation filter for a low noise conversion process, which ESS calls its HyperStream II architecture.Â. For the spec insatiable audiophiles, the ES9218 boastsÂ. 130 dB SNR and -114 dB Total Harmonic Distortion, and support for up to 32-bit 384kHz PCM and DSD256 file formats. Of course, real world additional circuit performance, required drive from the amp, and input file type will affect these stats somewhat, but they’re impressive nonetheless.. While most of the specifications look the same between the V30’s ES9218P and the V20’s ES9218 chips, a dig through ESS’ press material reveals that the P version is missing DSD512 data support. Furthermore, this time LG has chosen to let the user select between the chip’s three output filters. We’ll talk more about those in a minute.. For those who have moved over to wireless listening, LG is retaining its position as a leader when it comes to implementing high-quality wireless technologies. The LG V30 supports Qualcomm’s latest aptX HD Bluetooth codec , which vastly improves over traditional Bluetooth audio quality.Â. Other smartphones to support aptX HD are limited to the OnePlus 3, 3T and 5, the LG G5, G6, and V20, and just a small selection of others Â. LG is retaining its position as a leader when it comes to implementing high-quality wireless technologies.. In a nutshell, aptX HD supports high resolution 24-bit 48 kHz audio file formats over Bluetooth, up fromÂ. 16-bit 48 kHz with classic aptX.Â. Qualcomm targets a 4:1 compression ratio with its codecs, so classic offers a setÂ. 352 kbps bitrate while HD ups this toÂ. 576 kbps â a quarter of the bitrate of an uncompressed 24-bit 48 kHz file. However, due to its use ofÂ. adaptive differential pulse-code modulation to send compressed data, the end result is much better than a typical lossy codec.. The only downside is that you’ll need an aptX HD compliant set of headphones or speakers in order to make use of this high-quality codec. Currently these are in short supply, but more manufacturers are popping up with support this year.. Audio software options were pretty limited in the V20, but LG has sought to rectify this with the V30. You’ll find the mandatory volume control alongside the familiar left and right balance control in the Hi-Fi DAC settings menu. This is now accompanied with a selection of sound or EQ presets too.. A number of music applications come loaded with preset EQ options, sometimes even allowing users to configure their own, so this will be a familiar feature to many. However that particular feature is still absent from the V30’s options. Instead, LG has come up with four presets, which it claims are optimally designed based on popular tones and characteristics studies by its engineers. The final option is for the choice of digital filter sound characteristics, an interesting new setting that you won’t find elsewhere. At first it might appear that this is somehow linked to the sound presets, but some digging through ESS DAC datasheets (I can’t actually find one for the exact ES9218 model) reveals that a configurable FIR (finite impulse response) output filter is a common features of ESS’ chips.. Without going into too much detail, the final stage of any sigma delta DAC is to filter out the noise that’s been pushed into high frequencies, leaving us with just the audible signal. The trusty old Nyquist Theorem tells us that the maximum frequency for captured data appears at half our sample rate (24 kHz for 48 kHz files, etc), so we should filter out everything above that.. What you’re looking at in LG’s UI with that strange squiggly line is actually a filter representation known as an impulse response. This shows a filter’s frequency response as a sinc-function and the associated filter ringing or artifacts. The tighter the filter the more artifacts you’re likely to see, but the squiggle isn’t really very helpful for visualizing what the filter does, instead it’s easier to look at a graph of amplitude and frequency.. ESS Datasheet for the ES9018 reveals the different frequency responses of the Sharp and Slow filters. Data below 0.5x the sampling frequency is actually useful, so the filters are simply designed to remove noise.. Real world filters don’t cut off signals instantly and perfectly, and different FIR filter types can reduce the amplitude of frequencies outside of the passband more or less abruptly than others. This slope is often referred to as the speed of the filter, and this is what LG is referencing with Short, Sharp, and Slow.. Typically, faster filters suffer from more ripple in the pass and attenuation bands, which is what LG refers to as the pre and post ringing of the impulse and can be seen as the small ripples either side of the large pass frequency represented by the impulse response. Essentially, this can manifest as slight change in amplitude for frequencies around the “corner” of the filter.. Now, is this really important? The basic answer is no, as we’re dealing with a very high frequency filter we are highly unlikely to be able to hear any differences as a result of changing these filters. The more complicated answer is that “golden ear” types may profess to being able to detect subtle changes from an earlier filter roll-off, or differences as a result of filter ringing. But I’m skeptical as the changes will be minute, while the placebo effect of pressing a button and assuming a difference is always compelling.. As the V30 is boasting some top-notch output hardware, you’re going to want support for the very best file formats too. The V30 is the first global smartphone release to support theÂ. MQA format, which is short for Master Quality Audio.. The V30 is the first global smartphone release to support the MQA format. MQA is a high quality file format that boasts a better compression ratio for high-res audio than FLAC, but without the data loss associated with lossy file types like the MP3.. Instead, MQA repackages high frequency audio data into superfluous bits of data inherent in hi-res audio files.Â. It’s a hugely interesting technology, and shares some similar ideas to wireless variable quantization codecs used for higher quality Bluetooth audio. If you’re intrigued, here’s a brief need-to-know.. The study of real world recording applications reveals that the maximum achievable recording noise floor actually falls just above -120dB (20-bits), but 24-bit audio files give us a noise floor around -145dB. So we actually have 4 bits of excess data transmitted with each high-res audio sample. Furthermore, data above 48 kHz requires a much smaller dynamic range to reproduce, as it mostly just contains noise that is very close to the noise floor. Therefore, this data can be captured using a much lower bit-depth than the 20-bits used for the bulk of the music.. Stereophile MQA tucks high frequency data into the unused bits of lower frequency samples.. MQA encapsulates this very high frequency data and basically places it into the least significant bits of data betweenÂ. An area that would otherwise just contain random 1s and 0s of noise. It doesn’t stop there though, data above 24 kHz is losslessly resampled, compressed in a similar way and tucked below the noise floor below 24 kHz, resulting in a 24-bit, 48kHz file type that actually contains data all the way up to 192kHz. You can then compress this data using traditional lossless techniques to end up with a data rate of aroundÂ. 1.5Mbps per channel, which is smaller than an uncompressed CD file.. Interestingly, MQA files can be delivered via standard lossless file types, including FLAC, AIFF, and WAV. If you think about it, there’s no way of hearing that data encoded into bits that fall below the noise floor unless you decode them. So if your phone doesn’t support MQA it can still play back the file at CD quality, without uncompressing the data to reap its full benefits. However, if a hardware manufacturer licenses the MQA decoder, they can unpackage that extra information to reproduce high frequency components losslessly.. The MQA file type is supported by streaming service Tidal via a selection of specifically mastered tracks. So if you’re signed up to HiFi or an even better package, you’ll be able to enjoy higher quality music streaming with the V30 without eating up extra data. The video below from MQA mastermind Bob StuartÂ. probably explains all this better than I can, although I’ll leave you to debate the merits of keeping data from very high sample rates.. Ok, enough about audio playback, the LG V30 is also sporting some top-notch recording technology too. The HD Audio Recorder from the V20 and G6 makes a return, but this time with the introduction of a newÂ. the capability to use the audio receiver of the phone simultaneously as a microphone, which is designed to improve the capture of very loud sounds.. We’re not sure exactly what else has changed since the V20. three High Acoustic Overload Point microphones supporting undistorted audio capture up to aÂ. Perhaps these have been replaced with theÂ. Receiver-as-a-Mic implementation? The HD Audio Recorder option retains itsÂ. 24-bit/192kHz recording capabilities and lossless 24-bit, 48kHz audio recording output for video too.. It’s pretty clear then that the LG V30 boasts a premium audio setup. The handset has all the bases covered with a top of the line DAC for your wired headphones, support for higher resolution Bluetooth streaming with aptX HD, and the industry’s latest file format trend in MQA. Not forgetting a powerful microphone setup to ensure you’ve got great audio to go along with the footage captured from the equally impressive looking camera.. If you place a lot of value on the quality of your portable or streamed music collection, the LG V30 should certainly be on your radar if you’re looking for a new smartphone..

The V30 is smooth and quick running (no stutters scrolling, ever), has a great feel and balance to it physically, has a very nice display, a good main camera (not so good selfie cam), and a fantastic Hi-Fi music capability.. This is by far my favorite Android phone--and its the first to feel as integrated and smooth as my Apple phones did in the past.� Overall, as a phone, I'm very happy.. I'm more than happy, however, at the ability to plug in a set of great headphones, or an AUX into my car, and to be able to play much higher quality sound via the Hi-Fi DAC that is available.. I didn't think it was going to make much of a difference, but is really does.� If quality music is your thing, get this phone.. Rated 5 out of. Excellent Small Business Phone - on Verizon. We've used many different phones including Moto, LG & Samsung. I switched my personal phone after 5 years with Samsung Note II and IV. I appreciate the flat no-nonsense screen on the V30 vs all the useless curved glass on the Note 8 'monster' phone. As far as I'm concerned the Note 4 was the last no-nonsense phone from Samsung. Just make sure they can scan the bar codes on your box and this model instantly registers in their system. I installed the MOKO tempered glass screen protector and a Speck Presidio Grip case. The V30 I purchased here was manufactured Jan 2018 - no screen issues. No other issues in the 2 weeks I've had this wonderful phone.. Rated 5 out of. One Of The Best Smartphones Ever. I have the T-Mobile version and will get an unlocked as well. This is a smartphone that does everything really well. It looks and feels great, lightweight but solid quality build. Great P-OLED screen with great color. Quad DAC for the headphone jack provides excellent sound. The only phone in the U.S. that hooks into T-MOBILE's super fast 600mhz band (faster than gigabit). Best Smartphone Ive owned after 20 sine myPalm Treo 600 days.. Rated 5 out of. Beautiful screen, snappy performance, no carrier bloatware.� And, yes, it will activate on Verizon.� No issues.. Rated 5 out of. An LG phone that shouldn't be overlooked!. The unlocked LG V30 is everything I had hoped for in a flagship phone. With the lowered price, it was difficult to pass up and I'm glad I did not. I'm using this on T-Mobile with HD quality calls and WIFI calling when I choose without any problems. LG has installed minimal bloatware which is another plus.�All of the many software features work well. Just received an update from LG. Thought it was the Oreo update, but only security. �Very pleased with my purchase and customer service at B&H PhotoVideo.. Rated 5 out of. I upgraded to this phone from the LG V10 and overall the upgrade has been fantastic. The phone is fast, sleek, and feature-packed. The biggest upgrade is definitely the OLED screen - it's absolutely stunning. Even next to a brand new iPhone X, the LG's screen is an obvious winner (see the image showing the same exact picture on both phones. The LG is on the left). My unit also shows no banding at low brightness, although whites do appear a bit dirty/gray.. One of the primary standout features is IP68 water resistance. The SD slot is also a feature rapidly disappearing from today's flagship devices.. Unfortunately, in order to permit wireless charging and to provide a more sleek look, LG has ditched the removable battery. The battery appears to hold a long charge and has performed well for me so far, much better than my old V10's were performing, even with 3 different batteries I was swapping between. However, we all know that the battery will lose capacity over time and now replacing it with a freshly purchased one is a much bigger endeavor. Additionally, I have had to use the battery-pull reset method on my LG V10 many times, and I'm worried that the button reset will not be as powerful for resetting purposes as pulling a battery.. The phone is very sleek and beautiful; it feels as nice as the iPhone X and Galaxy S8+ do. Unfortunately, it loses the rugged durability of the V10, which means that 95% of us are going to wrap that sleek body in a clunky case anyways - so I don't give LG too many points for the beauty of the device itself, as we won't get to appreciate that during normal use.. This unlocked variant is definitely the way to go - the device came� almost entirely bloatware-free, with only a few LG apps that aren't too frustrating anyways. The ability to hop between carriers is also fantastic. One thing to note here - this variant does not come with the extra cord and USB-C wall plug that ship with Verizon's variant. So if you want to use USB-C charging speeds, you'll have to buy a type C-C cord and type C wall plug.. The software features feel fast and powerful, and there are little useful things left and right. Go watch a YouTube video of V30 software features and you'll see what I mean. One-handed support, fast camera launch, almost everything can be customized, the floating bar is nice, etc. Using the device is very enjoyable.. The primary annoyances I have discovered so far are: loss of removable battery, volume buttons moved to the side from the back (can be more easily bumped in pocket, etc.), headphone jack moved from the bottom of the device to the top (less convenient for when in pocket, but at least there still IS a jack), wide angle mode for selfie camera is terrible, selfie camera itself is not great, and whites look a bit dirty with brightness turned all of the way down.. That said, the upgrades are impressive and well worth those losses. Rated 5 out of. LG LG V30 US998 64GB Smartphone (Cloud Silver). LG LG V30 US998 64GB Smartphone (Cloud Silver) this is the most under rated phone on the market, the OLED display beats Samsung and Apple, the picture quality is 4K and knocks out the competition when you add in the Sony sound system adjustability, with presets ahead of recording and also adjustability afterwards, it is slim it is small feeling but a VERY LARGE phone indeed.. Rated 5 out of. The best smartphone I have ever owned.� Loving it, coming from a HTC U11 (which is a very nice phone also).� Lightweight, super snappy fast, great audio, don't use cam much but it is very nice, love the always on screen, battery life is fantastic.� I could go on and on...� Just eager for LG to release Andriod 8 Oreo update. But for this phone I am willing the wait.. Be the first to review this item. See any errors on this page?. Please enable javascript for your best B&H experience..
