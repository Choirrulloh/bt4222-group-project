Gionee Elife E8 is the successor to much acclaimed Elife E7 smartphone. Gionee Elife E8’s 6-inch WQHD Super AMOLED display offers great viewing angles and nice colour reproduction. Gionee Elife E8’s 24MP rear camera is capable of shooting some good pictures in professional mode with accurate colours. Updated: May 6, 2017 1:27 pm. Gionee S10 Lite launched at Rs 15,999: Price, features and. specs Gionee A1 Plus, A1 Lite prices slashed by the company: All you need to. know Gionee S11, S11s and M7 Plus launched: Price,. While smartphones with 6-inch displays may sound unwieldy for most, there is still a sizeable demand for large screen phones. The new Gionee Elife E8 caters to that segment. After the fate of Nexus 6 in India, not many have dared to launch big screen (above 5.5-inch) smartphones of late. However, with consumers getting comfortable with screen sizes ranging between 5.5-inch and 5.7-inch now, the 6-inch Gionee Elife E8 might get good traction.. Gionee Elife E8 comes with top end specs and competes with the likes of Samsung Galaxy A8, Nexus 6P, Motorola Moto X Style among others. So, should you look at the Elife E8 while spending around Rs 35,000 on a new smartphone? Here is the review.. Gionee Elife E8 tries to woo consumers with a premium design backed by top of the line hardware. Like Elife E7, the focus here is on the camera again. It comes with a 24 MP rear camera and claims to be the first Android smartphone to offer lossless zoom. Running Android 5.1 Lollipop OS, it is powered by a 2GHz octa-core Mediatek MT6795 Helio X10 CPU with 3GB RAM. On the software front, the device runs Gionee’s Amigo 3.1 interface. It also has a fingerprint scanner at the back.. Specs: 6-inch WQHD Super AMOLED Display | Amigo 3.1 UI based on Android 5.1 OS | 2 GHz octa-core Mediatek MT6795 Helio X10 CPU | 3GB RAM | 64GB internal memory expandable up to 128GB | 24MP rear camera with dual tone Flash | 8MP front camera | Dual SIM | 4G support | NFC | fingerprint scanner | 3,500 mAh battery with fast charging | Gionee Elife E8 full specs. The device comes with a good display which is essential for a big screen smartphone. The viewing angles are good and sunlight visibility is decent. While the display is quite bright; it doesn’t hurt the eyes.. The star feature of the Elife E8 has to be the camera. Gionee Elife E8’s 24-megapixel rear camera. The camera is fast and colours are pretty accurate. Coming to the ‘lossless zoom’ feature, the device does well but there is obviously grains visible while shooting at full zoom. The front camera is quite pleasing too.. On the performance front, the Elife E8 is a delight. Games run smoothly and multi-tasking is not a problem. Another good aspect of the Elife E8 is that it comes with ample storage. It offers around 53GB of internal storage which can be further expanded to 128GB via microSD card.. There is nothing much to complain about the device, but Gionee could have certainly come up with a better design. It is heavy and weighs 210 grams and the sharp edges make it difficult to operate with one hand.. The battery life of the device is not something to boast about. The 3,500 mAh battery can last a day at max.. If you are looking to buy a 6-inch smartphone, then the Elife E8 is no doubt a good choice. It’s a complete package in itself. However, the ambitious Elife E8 at a price of Rs 34,999 may not make the cut especially while competing with the likes of Motorola, HTC , Samsung or even an older iPhone..

Related: Hands-on with the super-slim, improved Gionee Elife S7. Gionee has been selling phones in India for a while, but this is the first time it has struck a deal with an online retailer.

Huawei also offers its Honor 7 through Flipkart’s site, while Xiaomi runs its own online store.. The highlight of the Elife E8 is its stunning 23.7-megapixel camera, which offers several special features to make shutter bugs happy.

Availability Officially announced: 10 Jun 2015. Shopping information MSRP price: $ 645. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Mobiles / Gionee Mobile Phones / Gionee Elife E8 Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 784 Launch Date in India: 16 October, 2015 Compare. Android Lollipop Fingerprint scanner 24 Megapixel primary snapper. No word regarding Android M upgradeability Big size. Gionee is one of many Chinese handset manufacturer that have entered the Indian handset market over last few years. And, just like all other Chinese brands, Gionne has also managed to impress the one and all with its budget friendly devices that are also high on specifications. The Elife E series of smartphones are its flagship series, which offers high end features to the power users in India. Gionee Elife E8 is the next big thing coming from the Chinese brand, which is expected to make its debut this month. Here is a brief overview of the handset for the benefit of our readers.. The design of the handset is befitting a high end, flagship device with matte finish back panel and glossy front. Moreover, with a sleek and slim design, the whole aesthetics of the handset is accentuated by a notch. However, what pricks our eyes is the notable bezels above and below the display with capacitive touchscreen buttons on lower bezel. Gionee could have opted for onscreen buttons for a larger display and sleeker look. The back panel of the handset also houses a fingerprint sensor apart from camera and dual-tone LED flash module.. The display of the handset happens to be the highlight of the handset owing to its sheer size and brilliant resolution. It comes with a display that measures a whopping 6-inch from corner to corne diagonally. And, with a Quad HD resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels, it offers a visual experience like no other handset. The size and resolution of the display results in a pixel density of. 490 ppi, which is quite impressive and will appeal to multimedia junkies.. The user experience of the Gionee Elife E8 happens to all but glorious and smooth to the hilt. We say this because the handset comes with the latest Android 5.1 Lollipop update installed in it out of the box. The operating system is already known for its visually appealing material design and performance enhancements. Now throw in the proprietary Amigo UI 3.1 interface and the whole package gets a lot better than it already is.. It seems that the handset maker was intending to design a performance oriented handset while designing the Elife E8. The handset has been equipped with a powerful Octa-core processor that has been clocked at 2 GHz for an outstanding performance. Moreover, the processor has been coupled with a massive 3 GB of RAM to provide ample memory for multitasking and other performance related tasks. This handset comes with a 3500 mAh battery that can last a considerable duration of time on a single charge.. Gionee Elife E8 happens to be one of the most powerful smartphone in the market when it comes to photography. We say this, as it boasts of a powerful 24 Megapixel snapper on its rear panel, which is definitely the most powerful snapper available in the smartphone market as of now. The snapper is loaded with features like optical image stabilization and phase detection autofocus. The front panel of the device houses an 8 Megapixel selfie shooter with autofocus.. It seems that Gionee has checked all the right tickboxes in terms of connectivity in Elife E8 smartphone. The handset comes with both 3G and 4G LTE support for a blazing fast Internet connectivity. Other options include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and microUSB for standard connectivity.. Gionee has placed the handset in sub-INR 40,000 price segment and as such it takes a lot of heat from a number of flagship devices. The handset will be facing competition from the likes of Samsung Galaxy S6, Motorola Moto Turbo, Google Nexus 6 and Apple iPhone 6. Needless to say, all of these devices are a benchmark by themselves.. The Elife E8 is a heavyweight as far as specs go and there is little to dissuade one from opting for this smartphone. What it actually boils down to is not its price but its size which feels a bit unwieldy. If you can deal with the unwieldy part, the Elife E8 is a strong proposition for you to consider..

2 years ago October 27, 2015. Gionee is not your average Chinese smartphone manufacturer company; it is that hub that many local mobile brands go to get their smartphones manufactured. Originally, a manufacturer of smartphones for others, Gionee realized that they should start their branded smartphones. The journey that started a couple of years ago has yielded good fruit to the company in various regions outside the homeland. Especially, India has played a key role in bringing out the best out of the Gionee products. Some of them are even designed keeping in mind the mid-range craze in the country like the F103 , a fashioned focused mid-ranger.. The company launched several handsets this year such as Gionee Elife S7 , Marathon M4 , and M5. But out of that the most astonishing was the Elife E8 , originally announced during June but recently launched in India. The E8 is the flagship device from Gionee, and it is being touted as the best camera smartphone of this year. Elife E8 is just for shutterbugs or does it have more to offer? We find out in this detailed review of the device.. There is nothing much familiar of the Elife E7 on the new E8, but one thing I would say that the bezels are still given much room. These days’ companies are focusing on removing any extra room for bezels and utilize it to offer compact size. With display 6-inch in size, the company could have taken some more measures ensuring the large size doesn’t affect the usability of the device.. The first thing comes into mind when you see this handset lying on the desk is that if it’s a small sized tablet. That’s the generous thing to say, but when you realize that it’s not exactly a tablet per say, but an oversized smartphone. Then, I won’t do justice to the design if I’m not slamming Elife E8 for its large heavy design.. Now that I’m over complaining about the oversize let’s get some facts straight about the design language on Elife E8. The device sports a metal body built but is not entirely a metal phone; the frame and edges are metal while the back panel is a removable plastic.. Neither the front nor the back is a fingerprint magnet, which is a good thing, as I’m quite sick of fingerprint magnet phones. Gionee may have screwed about the device size, but the company did well with certain other basic stuff like giving a giving camera shutter button on the right edge. As well as the placement of the Volume rocker keys and power button, which is also present on the right edge. Because I hate it when volume rocker placement is on the left edge, it’s just not intuitive design.. Talking further about the ports placements, the bottom edge houses microUSB port and a microphone while the top edge has the 3.5mm audio jack only. You can see the two band marks on the corner of the top and bottom edges. On the rear, you can see the camera module at the top center along with dual-tone LED Flash, just below that is the fingerprint sensor. Coming down is the Gionee branding and the loudspeaker, which has good output. The slight curve in all the corners on the back allows the device to have some space between the surface and corner. That’s smart design, as it helps in easily picking up the phone when its lying on a desk.. The 6-inch Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) screen is more than enough for a sharp and vibrant display one wants on their device. And since it is an AMOLED display I don’t have doubt that it would create any issue.. The 2K resolution and AMOLED technology together creates a perfect combination of entertainer. With a large real estate, the device is a big treat for consumers who like to watch movies while travelling. The E8 can be a good companion for those users since no extra gadgets would be needed for that purpose. Some of us like to travel with tablets for the work; the E8 isn’t a Note 5 with executive apps or multi-window functionality, but it should be good to create and edit documents on the go.. The sunlight legibility of the device is pretty incredible, you can see almost everything even when the screen is put under sunlight, of course, the brightness should be full, and otherwise it’s hard to see anything. The adaptive brightness feature is present since the operating system is based on Android Lollipop.. Some more interesting parts in the display are that you get three different LCD effects, which optimizes the color reproduction of the display. By default, it would be on Neutral while you can opt to go with Cool or Warm color based on your needs. Though, I would suggest you keep it neutral.. The display comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection, so you don’t have to think twice before placing the house keys and phone in the same pocket. But you’ll hardly put this gigantic phone in your pocket. Hey, I’ll just flaunt my large display phone instead feeling awkward putting it in my jeans pocket. Overall, the display is pretty stunning, and you’ll enjoy what you see if the large size is not an issue for you.. The interface is quite similar to recent Gionee handsets, F103, and Elfie S7. Based on the Android Lollipop 5.1 the device runs on the Amigo OS 3.1, which is the Android skin for Elife E8. Looking at what we saw on the E7, the company has improved upon their software interface a lot. The UI was one of the things that were pretty bad on the Elife E7 and in the end that handset didn’t even got the Android Kitkat update as there was some issue according to the company that they weren’t able to solve or something.. Comparing the predecessor regarding the software enhancements, the UI has come to a point where I actually enjoy using it. The earlier Amigo UI might have great content of features, but the new Amigo OS has totally changed the way one looks at the Chinese interfaces. I like the clean and simplicity of the new interface.. There is no app drawer present on the interface, so if you’re pretty conscious about them, you can anyway install Google Now Launcher. The overall interface experience won’t be affected, what you’re getting is a well-organized system that you can rely on.. Regarding bloatware, you’ll find tons of pre-installed apps that may not be useful for everyone, especially the games that are just the trial versions. Though, there are many apps that are quite resourceful to the system and users. Such as system manager, file explorer, system update, one-stop mobile security and many more. These apps are useful for a purpose of management and security.. While talking about the appearance, there are many options through which you can change the look of the interface. One of the ways is through Chameleon app, which allows you to change the color theme and wallpaper of system. Using the camera, it absorbs the color of the environment and creates a theme based on the color in surrounding. A very innovative way to create themes for the system.. Multi-tasking is pretty much similar to the Stock Android experience, once you tap on the menu button, you get recently launched apps. Though, there is no way to close all apps at once like the stock UI. Talking about the internal storage on the device, we have the 64GB variant with us, and it has around 52GB internal storage free out of the box. Moreover, you also have the option to expand the storage up to 128GB via microSD card slot, and it supports OTG drive as well, which we tested out for confirmation.. Powering Elife E8 is the Helios X10, Mediatek’s premium chipset that clock at 2GHz. Along with PowerVR G6200 GPU, 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, the device isn’t less than any beast. The same processor that is powering the HTC’s One M9 Plus , the Octa-core X10 is the first of the Helios series of chipsets that MediaTek has launched to compete directly with latest Snapdragon 800 series processors.. The powerhouse is optimized for incredible performance on the Amigo OS, which it delivers as advertised. I didn’t feel any lags as the Apps open swiftly, the multitasking is also quite snappy. I didn’t go easy while using it as a daily driver, whether you take gaming or heavy apps usage, the Elife E8 can take any challenge and succeed.. The experience in most of the games was smooth and without any lag, on top of that the loudspeaker was clear and has high sound intensity. You could truly enjoy the gameplay on Elife E8. But the fact that it heated quite a bit within a couple of minutes of gaming was bad. The area that is heated mostly was the Fingerprint sensor; it was almost unbearable to put the fingertip on the sensor just after the gameplay.. We tested the device for various popular benchmarks like Antutu and Vellamo. We were not surprised to see the scores for the Helios X10 processor. For Antutu, the device scored around 49500, which isn’t as great as expected from the processor. While the Vellamo scores for the browser was 2404, for Metal it was 1379 and Multicore score was 2338, among these three categories in Vellamo, the device of most of the flagships including LG G4 in Multicore score. Though, it didn’t beat the score of Samsung Galaxy S6 in the list.. The large screen allows a good browsing experience that was for sure, which we later realized was the icing on the cake. The Zoom-in and Zoom-out capabilities are amazing; moreover the screen responsiveness is quite fast. Loading the desktop version of the website is not recommended on smartphones, but Elife E8 experience is unlike any average smartphone since it has large display to showcase the whole website.. I would have liked if the menu, back, and home buttons were given on-screen because these capacitive buttons aren’t responsive at times. They demand force touch, which is not friendly at all, and they don’t have a backlit light for operations in the dark.. The ideal position for the fingerprint is on the front while these days’ companies are focused on offering the biometric sensor on the back. The Elfie E8 offers fingerprint sensor on the back of the device. While the placement may not be ideal, the feature works pretty neatly. Just tap on the sensor and you’re good to go. The sensor is present just below the camera module in a circular hole formation. You can clearly feel the depth, which is a good thing as when placed on a desk it won’t interfere with surface and thus less chance of it being damaged in prolonging use. Note you can add up to four fingerprints only.. The USP of the device are the cameras, specifically the rear camera that is of 24-megapixel and has the support of various impressive technologies such as PDAF (Phase Detection Autofocus), BSI Sensor, Ultra Pixel and much more. To aid these camera technologies, there is a dual-tone LED flash, Lossless Zoom up to 4X, Smart Scene to capture those cloudy details and a night mode for captures in low light.. Gionee Elife E8 – Low Light Normal Mode. Gionee Elife E8 – Low Light Night Mode. Gionee Elife E8 – Low Light Normal Mode 2. Gionee Elife E8 – Low Light Night Mode 2. Gionee Elife E8 – Low Light Normal Mode 3. Gionee Elife E8 – Low Light Night Mode 3. Gionee Elife E8 – Dark Light Normal Mode. Gionee Elife E8 – Dark Light Night Mode. Gionee Elife E8 – Dark Light Flash ON. We tested out the camera in various conditions such as low light, natural light, and artificial light. In all of these conditions, the camera performed pretty neatly in natural and artificial lighting conditions, but in low light it was as good as advertised. The night mode isn’t any good if you’re capturing photos in dark conditions, but instead I would suggest you go with Pro Mode or LED Flash for dark light captures.. Gionee Elife E8 – Natural Light Focus on Background. Gionee Elife E8 – Natural Light (3). Gionee Elife E8 – Natural Light (7). Gionee Elife E8 – Natural Light (6). The UltraPixel technology is just splendid, which lets you capture image sin up to 120-megapixel resolutions, i.e. The details can’t be hidden much more in such captures. This kind of photography haven’t been achieved on the smartphone camera, Gionee becomes the first to offer such technology. While Oppo did have a technology like this but that can only offer up to 50-megapixel image resolutions. This is a just an incredible feature on the Elfie E8.. Gionee Elife E8 – Normal Mode. Gionee Elife E8 – Ultra Pixel Mode. Left Side: 100% Zoom – Normal Capture , Right Side : 100% Zoom – Ultra Pixel Capture. The broad daylight captures were stunning, as you could see the color reproduction to be exactly same as reality. Further, the white balance and saturation was perfect in the image outputs. Talking about the video recording options, you get a 4K video option on the Elife E8. The fact that there is no OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) support on the camera sensor is sad because the large camera is capable of recording some amazing video content.. Gionee Elife E8 – Artificial Light Focus on Object. Gionee Elife E8 – Artificial Light Focus on Background. Gionee Elife E8 – Artificial Shot. Gionee Elife E8 – Artificial Close up Shot. Gionee Elife E8 – Artificial Light. Gionee Elife E8 – Artificial Light. Gionee Elife E8 – Artificial Light. Gionee Elife E8 – Artificial Light. Gionee Elife E8 – Artificial Light. Gionee Elife E8 – Artificial Light. Gionee Elife E8 – Artificial Light. The issue with the 4K content is that the device wasn’t able to play most of the recordings even though they were the MP4 format. We contacted the brand for this issue on the Elfie E8 and company reverted saying it might be the issue with the MediaTek Chipset, the Helios X10. Gionee has forwarded the issue with MediaTek’s Technology Team. And we should soon receive an update on this.. One more point that could have made it good was the Slow motion capture feature. While previous generation Apple iPhone with 8MP had the Slo-Mo option, Gionee couldn’t able to offer that option on their 24MP camera module, which is quite sad. We hope company consider this in future devices or if possible via an OTA update.. Talking about the front facing camera, it has an 8-megapixel camera sensor that apparently doesn’t have a wide-angle lens. We compared the front facing camera of E8 with Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and noticed the lack of wide angle lens. One could easily notice the difference as the Elife E8 fit less content on its bigger selfie camera. But don’t you worry about the quality of the selfie, it is quite good. Just take out your Elife E8 at the dinner table and try to catch all the family members in a selfie. You can read our detailed camera review of Elife E8 for further insight.. The large size comes with an advantage to the battery life, here you get the 3500mAh capacity battery, but when you compared the size to capacity ratio on Oppo R7 Plus , the device packs 4100mAh battery for same 6-inch device. Not to complain, but Gionee might have added few extra mAh to the battery. I guess that would have made it more bulky and heavier than it is at 9.6mm and 207 grams.. OTG Charging is one of the benefits of having a large battery capacity on your phone. If you like to carry a secondary phone with you, and that is running out of battery juice, then you can use the Elife E8 as the power bank to charge the secondary device. It is a quite convenient feature as you don’t necessarily have to carry a power bank all the time with you while travelling.. The standby time of the device is good, but it’s not even close to what company claims, the battery isn’t what I was expecting of the large capacity. The sole reason for quick battery life might be the 2K display, and since it has more real estate to showcase, the drain is quick. Though, it can get you through the day with average usage.I got around three and half hour of screen-on-time, which is pretty bad for such a massive capacity battery.. The device offers two power saving modes for different situations, normal power saving mode can be turned ON most of the time as it will allow power saving mode in the most efficient way without compromising the performance of the device. Whereas the Extreme mode was for when you have only a couple of percent battery juice left and wanted to keep your phone last longer than even on a normal mode. Note that in the extreme mode you’ll only able to make calls, reply to texts and see the clock. This will drastically increase the battery life. With not much good screen-on-time for a massive capacity, these power modes would be required.. The connectivity has always been the foremost part of the smartphone, every year it has been increased concerning the network speed. This year the 4G LTE has been a highlight in the country and thus a 4G enabled device is a must these days. The Elife E8 support fast 4G LTE network bands in the country, as well as other connectivity, needs including latest Wi-Fi standards, Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP support and Wireless Input device in the form of casting screen to other devices.. You get the support of NFC technology and company is generous enough to provide the NFC tags on their retail units, so the users can actually make use of the NFC. India is yet to incorporate NFC payments system, but you can still have fun using the NFC tags to activate different settings according to needs.. Talking about the call quality on the device, it was pretty clear all the time when I was connected to a 4G network, there were no call drops as such to complain about. We don’t know whether the four small holes above the camera module are the microphone, which may be the reason of the top-notch call quality. The Gionee Elife E8 is your flagship device of the year? No, I wouldn’t go that far, since it lacks in some important key points that need to be present on a great flagship device. It doesn’t offer a great battery life that one would be looking forward on a massive capacity battery. The large size would have been still manageable for me, even though I don’t like to carry such heavyweight devices in my pocket.. The points that it checks out are the impressive camera package, stunning display, great speaker output and a clean UI. For only these reasons, you can invest in the Elife E8. But if you have a budget of around 35K then you can surely go with much better options like Moto X Style , Oppo R7 Plus , and Samsung Galaxy S6. The Elife E8 is not exactly the best camera phone if we take 4K video recording issue under consideration. But it does make a good case..

Chinese handset-maker Gionee has launched its flagship Elife E8 smartphone in partnership with domestic e-commerce player Snapdeal priced at Rs. What is good? The phone has an elegant uni-colour look, its metal sides giving it sturdiness. The Gionee Elife E8 also comes with a dedicated camera button enabling users to take quicker photos. The positioning of the fingerprint scanner is good and it is also very fast.. The 6-inch wide quad-HD display is amazing to watch movies on. There were no problems with viewing angles.. The 64-bit octa-core MediaTek processor, along with a 3GB RAM, can take anything that you throw at it. Switching between apps was very fluid. Gaming was also fun as there were no lags while playing games like WWE Immortals, Nova 3, and Mortal Kombat.. Going by Geekbench 3 scores, the phone has excellent multi-core performance. On An Tu Tu, the phone scores 49,992 points, taking it very close to other rival flagship devices and above the Meizu MX4.. The Gionee Elife E8's rear 24-megapixel camera is an excellent performer under all light conditions. Pictures taken on the device came out clean with no noise or blur. This time, Gionee has also included a professional mode along with other modes like PicNote, Panoroma and Ultra Pixel and Smart Scene. The front 8-megapixel camera takes good pictures in well-lit conditions and is a premium performer for video chats.. Gionee finally took into consideration the need of storage for Indian consumers and has provided a 64GB internal storage which can be further expanded to 128GB via a microSD card.. The device also comes with other features which are common in flagships like NFC, Bluetooth 4, and Wi-Fi. The phone's 3600mAh battery is also very impressive, retaining a better part of the charge on heavy usage.. What doesn't work for the phone? The phone has a bulky design owing to its huge screen size and battery. The back panel is made of plastic which doesn't seem very appropriate and it is a tad heavy as well. The camera button's utility could have been improved if it could also be used to quick launch the camera app.. The screen-to-body aspect ratio could have been better to gain more advantage from the huge display.. Gionee's decision to go with a MediaTek processor could be a spoiler but the company's decision to stick to MediaTek could be due to the higher price points of Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. Using a Snapdragon would also increase the cost of the device, making it impossible to compete with rival devices in terms of an aggressive price point. A Snapdragon 810 SoC would make the phone one of the best in the market.. Although the E8 scores high points on An Tu Tu, it is nowhere near the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge plus which has an unrivalled 69,000-plus points.. The front camera doesn't capture wide angle pictures, which is a minus for selfies with a large group.. Keeping in mind the price, the features except for a Snapdragon processor, this is the perfect crwod-pleasing combo from Gionee's stable. Sales volume shall speak for the rest. It is definitely worth a look at before opting a costlier rival which mostly has the same specifications..

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Gionee Elife E8 Review: The Gionee Elife E8 brings with it an average design, good specifications and stellar performance. is it worth the asking price?. The Gionee Elife E8 brings with it stellar, hiccup-free performance and a great battery life. The display is underwhelming, when you compare it to the Galaxy S6 or the Nexus 6P, but that's the ONLY shortcoming. For what's on offer, the Elife E8 is a great smartphone.. PROS Good battery life Good camera Overall smooth performance Good gaming performance Amigo UI has an interesting set of features. CONS The display colour reproduction could have been better Unwieldy for single-handed use Non-removable battery.

Gionee Elife E8 is currently available at the best price of: ₹12,752. When you decide to drop 35k on a smartphone there are a few things one expects —. good build, great hardware under the hood, no premature battery drain and a camera with a lot of beauty modes. The device should make crystal clear calls, too. Chinese smartphone maker Gionee looks to take on the likes of the Nexus 6P, Samsung Galaxy S6 and more with the launch of the Gionee Elife E8. This is Gionee’s first smartphone priced around the 35K mark. Can Gionee cash in on beginners luck with the E8, or are you better off gunning for the brands that dominate this price segment?. With the Samsung Galaxy S6 we have an all-metal unibody design that will definitely turn heads. With the Nexus 6P , we have a sleek design with the perfect bulge for a camera. Both the smartphones have a very premium feel when it comes to the design, and the materials used to build it are top of the line, too. The Gionee Elife E8, on the other hand, has a plastic body, but the plastic used is of very good quality. You'd be forgiven for thinking that the device was made from metal. The back of the smartphone is removable, but you don't have access to the battery. Under the rear panel you have two SIM card slots along with a microSD card slot. Thank God, there is no hybrid slot here. The rear also houses the camera below, which rests the fingerprint sensor. The back of the Elife E8 is curved, just like we have seen on many other devices. This makes the device easy to hold, making it quite ergonomic. The review unit we received has the metallic gold finish to it and placed next to the gold Nexus 6P, looks a little pale.. Coming to the placement of the buttons on the device, the right has the volume rocker, power button and the dedicated shutter button. Even though the power button isn't textured like we have seen on smartphones from Motorola , its placement on the Gionee Elife E8 is perfect. It is easy to identify the placement of the power button without looking at the phone.. With its 6-inch display, the phone is quite big making it unwieldy for single-handed operations. It works well for two-handed operations, though. The biggest problem I have with the smartphone is that the capacitive buttons that rest below the display aren't backlit. This makes it very difficult to identify the Home menu and multitasking buttons under low-lit situations.. Overall, the build of the smartphone is good, and can survive a few drops from low heights, although we recommend you don't drop it. Cribbing about single-handed operations seems outdated, since large screen phones seem to be the trend these days.. As we’ve mentioned earlier, the smartphone has a 6-inch display, but where it stands out is with its resolution. It has a 2560x1440 pixels resolution, and the display uses an AMOLED panel, which puts it right up there with the creme. Standalone, the display of the smartphone is quite good. It's clear when you read texts, watch movies and play games, but place it next to the Nexus 6P, and we have a problem. Compared to the 6P, the Gionee Elife E8's display has a blue tint to it. It has a slight hue bias, and dim saturation. At full brightness too, the display is a little dim when compared to the Nexus 6P at full brightness. In outdoor conditions, the brightness is good, and viewing angles are good too, on the Elife E8.. Moving on to the UI on the Gionee Elife E8, the smartphone runs on Android v5.1 Lollipop, with the Amigo 3.0 UI overlaying it. The UI is quite similar to what we’ve seen on other smartphones.. There is no app drawer, and the Settings menu is a little different from stock Android. The drop-down notification gives you the notifications only. For quick settings, you need to swipe up from the bottom of the display. You have access to eight shortcuts from the pull-up drawer, and you have a bunch of options to choose from as far as these shortcuts are concerned. This is similar, but is better than the notifications tray we have seen on the QiKU. In the Q Terra, you have duplication of shortcuts between the pull-up and drop-down notifications. It’s a lot cleaner on the Elife E8.. A cool feature that I stumbled upon when using the smartphone is “Fake call”. Put simply, your smartphone rings and a female voice at the other end says, “Can you send me the files please?”. This is a very cool feature to have in a smartphone, and I did use it to get out of sticky situations at home. Another interesting feature of the Amigo UI is the changing wallpaper. There are five wallpapers that keep cycling and fresh wallpaper sets are downloaded too, on the device. It's nice to see the wallpaper change regularly without manual input.. Apart from the above-mentioned features, there is little difference in. the OS between China and India. I haven't used the Amigo UI in China, but some that have used it have told me that the UI has its own version of Google Now, which is very impressive. Alas, the feature hasn't trickled down to India.. Overall, the display of the device is impressive but when pit against the competition, it falls short. The UI is interesting with its features on offer, and delivers a lag- and bug-free experience.. Before we delve into the performance of the Gionee Elife E8, here is a quick look at the specifications of the smartphone. As we've mentioned earlier, the smartphone has a 6-inch AMOLED display with 1440x2560 pixels resolution. Under the hood, the device has the MediaTek MT6795 Helio X10 chipset with an octa-core CPU clocked at 2GHz, coupled with 3GB of RAM. It has 64GB of built-in storage, expandable by an additional 128GB via a microSD card. The rear of the smartphone has a 24MP camera with OIS, phase detection autofocus and a dual-LED (dual tone) flash. The rear camera can also shoot video in 4K. The front has an 8MP selfie camera. A 3500mAh battery powers the entire package.. Moving to the benchmark performance, here is how the smartphone compares to other devices in its price range.. Gionee Elife E8 performance Create bar charts. From the benchmark scores, it is clear that the Gionee Elife E8 isn’t the best but it scores well nonetheless.. Moving on to everyday performance, the device worked very well, be it texting, calling, playing games, watching videos, playing music, and more. Despite having the speaker at the back of the device, it was loud and clear. Placing the smartphone on a table while playing music did muffle the audio a little bit, but not as much as we have seen on other devices.. The Gionee Elife E8 houses a fingerprint sensor. One noticeable thing is that the fingerprint sensor is considerably dented when compared to the likes of the Nexus 5X, 6P, Honor 7, or even the iPhone 6s. This isn't a bad thing by any means. It just ensures that your finger gets to the sensor rather than partially touching it. The fingerprint sensor works well, even if it isn't as fast as Nexus Imprint.. Moving on to the camera performance of the Elife E8, it is really good. Images produced are sharp, clear, and it is easy to achieve a depth of field effect by simply tapping the area you want to focus on before hitting the shutter button. You have a bunch of shooting modes at your disposal, such as face beauty, night, magic focus (for getting better depth of field), and more. Put simply, if you are looking for a smartphone with a great camera, you can definitely consider the Elife E8.. The call quality from the Gionee Elife E8 is good. It has good audio at both ends, and the only time we faced trouble was with the network.. Watch Gionee Elife E8 In-depth Review Below. Overall, the performance of the phone is good. I handed the phone to a few of my friends, and at first glance they weren’t impressed and I don’t think you can blame them, as the phone is simple to look at. They weren’t very receptive of the Gionee brand, either. It was only when we started clicking a few pictures that they were impressed. They were also impressed when the phone outlasted their devices in terms of battery life. It was a process, trying to convince them about the features of the smartphone, and at the end of the day, I don’t think they were impressed. At a price point of 35k, it's difficult to recommend the Gionee Elife E8 to brand-conscious people with a closed mind. The device isn’t perfect, but is great with what’s on offer. The camera is great, and the overall performance is hiccup-free. But, handing the device to the non-techie community that I'm associated with and asking them if they would buy the device, I am yet to receive a positive answer. Some people diss the interface, others talk about the brand, some say it doesnt look like a 35k smartphone, and there are only a handful of people that agree with me that it's a great device to consider. I really like the phone for what it does. The battery life is better than the Nexus 6P (which is my ideal weapon of choice), and the camera produces stellar images.

Higher count of megapixels does not necessarily mean better photographic performance, but what makes the Elife E8 rear camera special is the ability to deliver photos up to 120 megapixels in resolution.. Gionee has added a dedicated Ultra Pixel software that enables it to stitch multiple shots together to deliver photos in 120-megapixel resolution. The feature is expected to appeal to users who want greater details in photos, which are at par with photos taken by DSLRs. One main advantage of such high resolution is that you can crop a certain part of the photo with minimum distortion.

In normal mode, you can take stretch the resolution count to 24-megapixel (aspect ratio of 4:3). To take the 120-megapixel image, tap on the menu icon that appears on the top.. Drop down Menu will show you several modes such as Normal, Professional, HDR etc. Scroll right, tap on the Ultra Pixel.. Keep the lens steady while capturing the photo. It takes about 4-5 seconds to process the image. So, be bit patient while holding the camera.. Your 120-megapixel resolution photo is ready. To review the difference from the photo taken in normal and the one taken in Ultra Pixel mode, use a larger display, perhaps your laptop. You will notice the focus area of the image has amazing detailing.. Here are a few images taken in the Ultra Pixel mode. Click the image on the right hand side to see in full size.
