CNET también está disponible en español.. The best Windows Phone device to buy right now. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Nokia Lumia 930 has a crisp, bold display that makes Netflix shows look great, its camera is up there with the best and its metal and colourful plastic body will turn at least a few heads.. The Bad Its battery life doesn't impress, it's quite a chunky beast, Windows Phone 8.1 doesn't come with the Cortana voice assistant outside of the US and the platform still suffers from a mediocre app selection.. The Bottom Line With its great display, brilliant camera and attractive, colourful design, the Nokia Lumia 930 has most of what you'd expect from a top-end Windows Phone device. It's battery lets it down though and with an unimpressive selection of apps still available from the Windows Phone store, a high-end Android device with a good camera will likely be a better option for many of you.. Design Display Windows Phone 8.1 software Camera Nokia Lumia 930 camera test. If you're tired of seeing all those Samsung Galaxy phones and iPhones in everyone's hands and fancy something different -- a little more colourful maybe -- cast your eyes over Nokia's latest flagship. The Lumia 930 has a slick metal band running around the edge, it comes with a plastic back available in either a vivid green, bright orange or white and black if you don't want to stand out quite so much.. Like all Nokia's Lumia phones, it runs on Windows Phone software -- in this case, the latest 8.1 version. As a top-end phone hoping to do battle against the likes of the Galaxy S5. and LG G3 , it comes with a strong lineup of specs including a 5-inch full HD display, a 2.2GHz quad-core processor, 4G LTE and a 20-megapixel camera. It's almost identical to the Lumia Icon , a CDMA version which is exclusively available in the US from Verizon -- the Lumia 930 is the GSM model.. You can snag the Lumia 930 SIM-free from Nokia directly for £440 in the UK or for free on contracts starting at £30.50 per month at Carphone Warehouse. In Australia and the US, you can find it unlocked from various online retailers for around AU$700 or $600.. With its metal edging and plastic back panel, the Lumia 930 is very similar to the older Lumia 925. That's no bad thing, as I found the 925 rather luxurious. The 930's metal band gives a sturdy feel to the phone, while also letting you lord your premium materials over your plastic Galaxy S5-toting friends. The 930 is chunkier than the 925, however, with squared, angular edges, rather than the 925's curved sides. The plastic back panel has a soft-touch matte effect which feels good to hold and, like most of the Lumia range, is available in various garish hues. My review model came in a bold green colour, but you can also snag it in vibrant orange or white if you're not keen on colourful phones.. The glass front is only broken by a small slit for the speaker -- the navigation buttons along the bottom are touch-sensitive. This button-less front adds to the premium aesthetic, as does the attractive way the glass curves at the edges to meet the metal band. Although I'm very keen on the design, it split opinion on the CNET UK team, with Luke Westaway in particular arguing that it feels "thick and cheap". My advice would be to get your hands on one in a shop before you splash your cash.. With a 5-inch display, the 930 clearly doesn't fall into the compact category, but it's also not too huge -- not like the 6-inch Lumia 1520. It has a very narrow bezel around the display, which means the body hasn't needed to bulk out too much to accommodate the large screen. I found it reasonably to comfortable to hold in one hand although its relatively heavy 167g weight means it can be cumbersome when you're typing one-handed.. Tucked into that metal band are the volume and power buttons (also metal) and a dedicated camera shutter button that allows you to half-press for focus before taking the picture. The micro-USB port sits on the bottom and the 3.5mm headphone jack is on the top, where you'll also find the nano SIM tray. This is fiddly to pop out, even with a removal key.. What you won't find is a microSD slot to expand the built-in storage. That's pretty disappointing, particularly for a flagship phone. Although its 32GB is rather generous, high-resolution, raw-format photos aren't small and hardcore shutterbugs among you may find the space running low after a particularly photogenic holiday.. The 930's 5-inch display has a full HD (1,920x1,080-pixel) resolution. It's not the first Lumia we've seen with a full HD screen -- that was the 6-inch Lumia 1520 -- but as the 930 packs the same number of pixels into a smaller space, its display is sharper. It has a pixel density of 440 pixels per inch, which bests the 367ppi of the 1520.. In real terms, that means the 930's display is very crisp. The large tiles of the Windows Phone 8.1 interface are extremely sharp, as is the small text that appears on some of the live tiles. Images too look great, helped by the display's rich colours and deep black levels. Netflix shows look excellent, as does just swiping through some of the stunning photography that crops up on the 500px app.. It's very bright too which not only helps counter reflection from overhead office lights, it also means it's easily readable under bright sunlight. Intense Melbourne sun may still required hand to shade, but under London's wan summer skies, I found it easy to read.. The 930 arrives with the absolute latest version of Windows Phone 8.1. Visually, Windows Phone 8.1 is very similar to previous versions of the software. The homescreen is still made up of resizable, colourful tiles showing live information and any apps you don't want there are held in an alphabetical list off to the right.. There are a few recent tweaks to take note of. Most importantly, WP8 has finally been given a pull-down notifications panel, letting you see incoming texts, emails and so on, as well as providing quick access to critical settings such as brightness or Wi-Fi. You're also now able to set your own images as backgrounds on the homescreen. The image isn't actually on the background, but rather makes some apps look transparent, with the image behind. It's an unusual look, but I quite like it -- I do wish more apps were compatible with the effect though.. A major feature of Windows Phone 8.1 is the digital assistant Cortana , which is similar to Siri on the iPhone. Cortana is still US-only for the moment, so Lumia 930 users in the UK, Europe or Australia won't be able to bark orders at their phone in the same way Lumia Icon users in the US can. Windows Phone 8.1 is easy to use, thanks to its minimalist interface and straightforward way of doing things. If you're not keen on Android's sometimes complicated foibles, but can't afford to go with the iPhone's simplicity, Windows Phone 8.1 could be a good compromise.. Where it falls down though is its apps. Although the app store does have some major names such as Netflix, Spotify, Skype, Whatsapp and Instagram, it doesn't have much else to offer. It's nearly always the last of the app stores to receive new releases, if it receives them at all.. Its problem is that Windows Phone still doesn't have many users compared to Android or iOS, so developers don't bother spending time making apps for the platform. But without those apps, new users don't switch to the system and the vicious cycle continues. Fair to say, if you're keen on getting the latest apps and games, Windows Phone will not keep you happy.. On the back is a 20-megapixel camera. Nokia has a strong record pairing great cameras with its phones -- the Lumia 920 and 925's cameras were good and the Lumia 1020 is arguably more camera than it is phone. I therefore had high hopes for the 930 and I wasn't disappointed.. On my first shot, overlooking the city of London across the river Thames, I was impressed at the even dynamic range, lack of any overexposure on the clouds and the realistic colours.. This knotted rope on the riverbank looks crystal clear, with attractive depth of field. There's loads of detail even when you zoom in, thanks to the high resolution of the sensor.. Wandering further down the South Bank, I was generally impressed at the 930's ability to cope with bright skies and shadowy areas.. It's not perfect though, as these shots of the river bank and the Globe Theatre show. Both of them have quite washed-out skies. There's no HDR mode as standard on the phone, which on other phones would help achieve a better balance between bright and dark areas.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Please try your search again later.. An unlocked phone is a device that is not bound to any carrier or plan. It allows you to choose your phone first and your carrier second. Upon selecting a plan, simply insert the carrier's SIM card into the phone and you're ready to go. If you decide you want to change carriers down the road or want to take an international trip, it's as simple as replacing your existing SIM card with a new SIM and activating your new plan.. What are the benefits of an unlocked phone?. Freedom: Choose the carrier with the best service or price. If you find a better deal later, you have the ability to change to a different carrier.. Travel: Take your phone internationally and use the carrier of your choice. It's as easy as inserting an active SIM card.. Selection: Choose the phone with the features you want, whether or not your carrier sells it, and get more service options without a contract.. How do I set up my unlocked phone?. The first thing you’ll need is a SIM card for your desired carrier. When activated, the SIM card will let your phone connect to your carrier’s network. If you decide to upgrade to a newer unlocked phone in the future, you can easily remove the SIM card from your old phone and put it in your new phone—just make sure you get the right size of SIM card (nano, micro, or standard) for your phone. If you want to use your phone while traveling internationally, you can easily buy a SIM card for a carrier that operates where you’re traveling. As long as it’s activated, you can just swap SIM cards when you arrive at your destination..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 1.0 out of 5 stars This phone WAS a great buy!. This phone WAS a great buy! Being a windows fanboy I was excited to purchase my Lumia 930 on Sept. Everything with the phone worked exceptionally well Especially the camera to which I pitted against that of the ipone 6s and galaxy s6 which my friends owned. Long story short, in 6 out of the 10 tests we carried out with the three phones the lumia won with the iPhone and galaxy performing considerable better in the low light tests. So I was a very happy camper since photography was one of the main reasons I purchased this phone. And with windows 1o mobile looming I knew that app gap will start to shrink slowly but surely. Almost a month in and really enjoying my phone.Then I decided to upgrade to Windows 10 mobile. Everything worked great! The new menu and quick access bars were just what the phone needed to make the OS morefluid in terms of user handling. Then I realized that on calls no one could hear me. WhatsApp voicenotes were silent, Skype, My Talking Tom, Pretty much everything that involed the mics did not receive any audio input. Not even the 2 speakers at the back for surround sound video recording worked. I tried restarting, resseting, downgrading to the original windows 8.1, denim, but nothing worked. Did some research and found out that there were a lot of people experiencing this problem and the only resolution was to return it to the store and have the mics fixed this confirmed that this was infact a hardware malfunction. The only problem with my case was I bought it online, got the international unlocked version which comes with no warranty and didn't take the Amazon warranty so I'm basically screwed. I have a cell phone which takes great photos but I cant use it as a cell phone. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars While it does work on T-Mobile I knew going in that I'd be losing LTE which sucks but since it supports HSPA+ bands for T-Mobile. I bought this to replace my iPhone 6 on T-Mobile. While it does work on T-Mobile I knew going in that I'd be losing LTE which sucks but since it supports HSPA+ bands for T-Mobile I figured it wouldn't be that bad and it would tide me over until there was a better WP flagship. I'm so glad I bought it though, yes the internet is a little slower but this is by far the best phone I've ever used. First off the design and the materials used are amazing. It feels like something you'd expect to come from Apple, except somehow better. It's super solid and expensive feeling. It looks absolutely amazing, super high end. The camera I wasn't expecting to be that amazing but it totally blows the iPhone 6's camera away! It's kind of hard to take a bad shot with this camera. Overall, even if you're on AT&T or T-Mobile and have to go back to 3g or HSPA+ do it, it's well worth it!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome Phone. I have owned many phones from Motorola to Nokia (Old School versions) then i went to iPhones (4 and 4s). I have also owned blackberry bolds and many Samsung phones (S2, Note 2, and S5). I stated the phones i owned before, so that you can have a good idea of my personal phone experience. My wife lost her phone and i wanted to try the new Nokia 930, so i gave her my Samsung S5. It was a very good decision because this phone is awesome. Windows 8.1 is a very good phone OS, i would say it is better than iOS and Android when it comes to social media integration, user interface and just overall fun to use. The 930 is built very very well and internal hardware functions well with the OS. I'm giving the 930 five stars because it exceeded my expectation (greatly) and its a beautiful phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars I HATED this phone from the day I opened it. I'm only giving this phone 2 star due to the operating system. The phone itself works EXACTLY as I expected. I HATED this phone from the day I opened it. I tried it for a bit and very quickly realized that the windows operating system is the WORST! All the apps are third party apps and most cannot do very many functions that the real app on android or iPhone can. The phone itself is not too bad. If this phone ran on android or IOS, I'd probably give it a 5 star rating!. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing! Lumia 930 deserves to be a Flagship Windows Phone :-). I have been using this phone for over 2 weeks now and I can say that all the Apps that I had on the Samsung Galaxy S5 and LG G3 are on this phone (hint: from the windows store) and they actually work a lot better. I notice no lag and a very fast and fluid experience. One thing I really enjoy that Android and Apple Phones don't have is the extremely loud speakers, Built-In Pedometer, and Amazing 20MP Camera. I don't need the 20MP camera but in dark and low-light conditions, it outperforms many flagship android and cyanogen phones. I think the only competitor to this phone (in terms of camera quality) are the Apple Phone 6 and HTC One M9 Great Windows Phone and will get upgraded to Windows 10 later this year which is a plus..

The Nokia Lumia 930, also known as the Lumia Icon in the US, is the 5-inch follow-up to the Lumia 925. It is the first handset to launch since Microsoft’s buyout of Nokia’s mobile division in April 2014. It’s now available on contracts from just £22 a month and its SIM-free price has been slashed to £279/ $330. It would have required a heftier £449 outlay at launch, putting it head-to-head with the likes of the iPhone 5S and higher-end Android phones of the time like the HTC One M8 , Samsung Galaxy S5 and Xperia Z2 .. This handset is an upgrade in almost all respects compared with its predecessor, the Lumia 925. Packing Windows Phone 8.1 , Microsoft’s slowly improving mobile operating system, it’s the nearest we’ve come to a Windows phone that can cut it with the best Android phones and iPhones. The Lumia 930 is a well constructed handset that feels built to last, though it lacks the trailblazing qualities of Nokia phones of old. The design is actually one of the few aspects of the phone that hasn’t improved. If anything it’s a backward step compared with the Lumia 925.. Like most Lumia phones the 930 embraces colour. Nokia has swapped out the chiefly metal design as seen on the 925, opting instead for a metal frame and polycarbonate matte black that’s available in bright orange and green. You can get the phone in a more subdued black or white, exclusive to Phone4U, but we imagine many buyers will be attracted to the louder, highlighter-style shades that Nokia is pushing. SEE ALSO: Best Mobile Phones 2014 Round-up The 930’s squarer, chunkier body makes it much less appealing than many of its rivals. At 9.8mm thick, the Lumia 930 is considerably beefier than the Samsung Galaxy S5 (8.1mm), and its square edges make it feel chunkier than the more agreeably-curved frame of the HTC One M8 (9.35mm).. Consequently, the Lumia 930 is one of the less comfortable phones to hold we’ve reviewed, even if the slightly raised back rests nicely in the palm. The 930 also weighs 167g, making it heavier than the M8 (160g) and the Samsung Galaxy S5 (145g), though the weight difference is less problematic than the rather boxy body.. The button and port layout is fairly conventional. The headphone jack is on the top edge; the microUSB charging port at the bottom below the physical touch keys; and the volume rocker on the right edge, along with the on/off button and a dedicated camera button. The nanoSIM card slot is well disguised next to the headphone jack, where a fingernail instead of pin is suitable to open up the tray.. Like the 925, there’s no expandable memory, which is going to disappoint many given Android alternatives routinely have them, though of course the iPhone doesn’t have one, either.. SEE ALSO: Best Android Mobile Phones 2014: Round-up. The Lumia 930 follows the big phone trend by jumping from the 4.5-inch screen in the 925 to a larger 5-inch Full HD AMOLED display. It has an impressive 441 pixels per inch (ppi) pixel density and is toughened up with Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Of course, AMOLED screens are famous for their deep, inky blacks, so it’s little surprise the Lumia 930 has Nokia’s ‘ClearBlack’ label.. Those deeper blacks are immediately obvious when you glimpse at the Live Tile user interface. It’s an extremely bright screen as well and like the 925, the contrast and vibrant colours really impress. Colours can have a habit of a looking a tad oversaturated, as is common with AMOLED displays, and some early users have reported a purple tint on white pages, but neither issue is hugely detrimental.. SEE ALSO: Best Windows Phone Round-up. Nokia also includes a comprehensive set of display settings where you can can adjust the screen’s colour profile to standard, vivid or cool. There’s also the option to tinker with colour temperature, tint and colour saturation in the advanced settings and see how the adjustments look in a series of images before they are applied. Additionally, you can also adjust brightness, switch on a sunlight readability mode or reduce screen brightness when the Battery Saver mode is active.. If we are being really picky, the display doesn’t quite match the LG G3 or the Samsung Galaxy S5. The Quad HD screen on the G3 has a ludicrously sharp 534 ppi spread across a larger 5.5-inch screen, while the work Samsung has done fine-tuning the S5’s Super AMOLED really shines through, but even so the Lumia 930’s screen is very good..

The Nokia Lumia 930 is a Lumia Icon look-alike smartphone with a 5-inch 1080 x 1920-pixel AMOLED display, a 20-megapixel PureView camera, and a few software tricks up its sleeve. The Lumia 930 will ship with Windows Phone 8.1 on board, and it comes with metallic elements on the side, plus it also supports wireless charging. In addition, just like many other Lumias, it captures outstanding sound thanks to its advanced (likely, HAAC microphone) that also support directional stereo recording.. HTC One M9 vs Nokia Lumia 930 Nokia Lumia 930 Review Nokia Lumia 930 manual Nokia Lumia 930 benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.39 x 2.80 x 0.39 inches (137 x 71 x 9.8 mm). Weight: 5.89 oz (167 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 5.0 inches. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor, Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3). Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Optical image stabilization, Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Face detection, Smile detection, Digital zoom, Touch to focus, Geo tagging. Settings: ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, Panorama, Night mode, Scenes. 3840x2160 (4K) (30 fps), 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (30 fps). Features: Optical image stabilization, Continuous autofocus, Video light, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Talk time: 11.50 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 23.0 days (552 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 15.50 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: DLNA. Features: Album art cover, Background playback, Preset equalizer, Dolby Digital Plus. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 20, 8, 3, 1, 7. Data: LTE Cat 4 (150/50 Mbit/s), HSDPA+ (4G) 42.2 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s. Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones (MP3), Vibration, Phone profiles, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone.

Navigation: Turn-by-turn navigation, Voice navigation, Points of interest (POI). Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 02 Apr 2014. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

The Nokia Lumia 930 is a high-end smartphone developed by Nokia that runs Microsoft's Windows Phone 8.1 operating system. It was announced on April 2, 2014 at Microsoft Build 2014 and was released in April 2014 as Nokia's (and later Microsoft Mobile 's) flagship. [4] It is the last high-end Nokia-branded Lumia device and succeeded by the Microsoft -branded Lumia 950 and its XL equivalent .. The Nokia Lumia Icon , which is exclusive to Verizon Wireless in the United States, is essentially a derivative of the Lumia 930. The two versions share a common design and specifications; the only hardware difference is that the 930 is equipped with GSM radios and available as both carrier-locked and unlocked versions , while the Icon has both GSM and CDMA radios and is always sold unlocked. The other difference is that the 930 was originally pre-loaded with the newer Windows Phone 8.1 rather than the previous-generation Windows Phone 8 Update 3 on the Icon.. Neither the 930 nor the Icon have the Glance feature, which displays the time and other selectable information on the display of an otherwise sleeping phone. While other contemporary Nokia smartphones have Glance, the 930 and Icon do not because their displays lack the necessary "display memory" feature. Some handsets experience heat and battery drain issues. Some handsets have had a display discoloration issue, when the device came out. A significant number of Lumia 930 users have reported an issue with the operation of the audio microphones, where handsfree calls and video recordings have very low audio levels. This has been confirmed to be caused by a motherboard fault. There have been a number of reports of this being a software issue introduced with Windows 10, though this is incorrect as the issue is also reported with Windows 8.1, including pre-Denim releases. A workaround for Lumia 930 users experiencing this issue is to use ear buds that have a microphone included when doing handsfree calls and video recordings.

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. A colourful handset that battles against Windows Phone. The Lumia 930 is the most complete Windows Phone to date. It's the first to properly challenge the flagship might of Android and iOS with its impressive design, new Windows Phone 8.1 software and all round decent specs.. ClearBlack display Metallic rim Windows Phone 8.1 Pureview 20MP camera Here and there Wireless charging. Windows Phone is going on four years old now – and it's still never had the standout phone that shows it's a platform that can compete with the iPhone and the best Android has to offer.. The Nokia Lumia 930 looks to be just that phone, with a next-generation screen, a much-improved processor and a new version of the OS to give users more customisation than ever before.. This is still a Nokia phone, despite the buyout by Microsoft, and the heritage is plain to see with the choice of coloured plastic backs combined with the metallic trim.. But here's the key question: does the Nokia Lumia 930 have the ability to mix it with the big boys? It's got a higher spec sheet than ever before, the still-great camera and all of the Finnish / American toys it can pack on board, and it's coming out of the gate for cheaper than the competition too.. On top of that you've got a decent accessory ecosystem around it, a strong identity and an ever-growing user base for Windows Phone.. But there's also the other side of it: the Lumia 930 is using last year's components and still has to battle against the fact Windows Phone is still running behind iOS and Android in both the popularity and app stakes.. It's a tricky one – read on to see if the new Lumia could possibly be your next phone.. The first thing that you'll notice about the Windows Phone 8.1 -powered device is the fact it's got a much improved screen over its predecessors.. The ClearBlack display is just that: clear and capable of display deep blacks. Yes, the Lumia 1520 had a large 1080p screen, but it was much bigger than the 5-inch version on show here and as such the sharpness suffered as a result.. But the AMOLED ClearBlack display used on the Lumia 930 is just brilliant. I've had too many tedious arguments with others about the benefits of LCD over OLED technology (yes, such is the effervescent life of a technology journalist) but you can't argue that OLED just looks better.. Whether it's the deep blacks, rich contrast or generally decent colour reproduction (which Nokia has nailed with its ClearBlack technology) the screen quality on the Lumia 930 is a really lovely experience.. It makes the live tiles really stand out on the home screen, and combined with Nokia's love of colour, the whole effect is really rather nice.. One of the key benefits of OLED technology is the fact that when a portion of the screen is black, it's completely switched off. This means that the disparity between bright white sections and the darker portions is more apparent, and from the moment you switch on the Lumia 930 you get the sense that this is a good quality phone.. There's also the battery saving element (if a pixel is off, it's drawing a lot less power... actually, pretty much none) so that's a benefit too.. I'm going to come onto the design of the Lumia 930 in the next section of this review, but it's worth talking about here as it's something Nokia is using as a real selling point for its new handset.. The combination of a metallic rim and polycarbonate back is nothing new, but Nokia's bolstered the strength of the phone with this year's design, and it works pretty well.. The lighter grey exterior has a very Scandinavian feel to it, and combines well with the brighter colours - although you can get black and white versions if you prefer your smartphone a bit more low key.. It feels solid in the hand, but the weight and thickness is pretty hefty for a 2014 flagship smartphone... it's hard to work out why Nokia has increased things here, but it's definitely a design that stands out from the crowd and offers a very well-built phone.. Again, I feel like I'm ruining a later section, but the update to Windows Phone is a key selling point of the Lumia 930, at least in the early days of sale.. There aren't a huge amount of phones packing the update at this point, and users will benefit from new elements like a notification area (Action Center), more options with the background wallpaper and more live tile options than ever before.. It's good, but still needs more to impress. Sadly, in the UK there's no look at Cortana yet, but that will be coming pretty soon we're told, and that will offer some decent access to one of the best voice assistants on a smartphone.. Windows Phone 8.1 pushes the OS forward by a huge amount - it was sorely needed, and doesn't quite get it up with the best, but just a little bit closer. Nokia's Lumia 930 is a good poster boy for this, and the combination of power and design gives a good experience under the finger.. Nokia's camera heritage has been a mainstay of the mobile phone for nearly a decade now, since the decision to stick a snapper on the back of a handset.. With Pureview Nokia's really owning this space, with the Lumia 1020 still arguably the best camera-on-a-phone out there (not the best cameraphone, as what's running underneath is sub par).. The Pureview sensor on the Lumia 930 is similar to that seen on the Lumia 1520, which is a shame, as I was really hoping for something really advanced and could allow me to stop carrying the 1020 around with me.. It's not in the same league as the 41MP sensor on that device, but it's still very much one of the best on the market, as you'll see with the later camera samples.. Another of Nokia's big strengths is the Here suite of products that it bundles with the Nokia Lumia range - and will probably be completely available on all Windows Phone devices in the future if Microsoft has anything to say about it.. The big hitters are Here Maps and Mix Radio in my opinion - the former being a big win because of the ability to take maps offline as well as relevant information being spread throughout the app.. It's a much better app than it used to be too - while you still need to download plugins to make it fully functional, at least those extra bits are now available. It allows for easy mapping and is arguably a more coherent sat nav option than those from Apple or Google, which you should note if you're one to use your phone to navigate around in the car.. However, it's still not up to the standard of Google Maps, either in interface or general functionality. What you gain in offline capability and relevant information you lose in general interface - the slower way of flicking through the map (even with the extra grunt of the quadcore Snapdragon 800 chip running under the hood) shows that this is still something that needs more work to be a real competitor.. Nokia's onboard app offering still needs work. Mix Radio is an interesting proposition though. The idea is that it forces new music onto you (and for free, which is brilliant) and even lets you sync offline without paying any more.. The range of genres and pre-mixed playlists is really something, and despite downloading Spotify as well (which needs a lot more work on Windows Phone) I found myself initially drawn to this app to see what was on offer music-wise.. However, it didn't take long to start to fall out of love, as it relies heavily on a connection most of the time, and if you go underground or on a train with low signal it can really upset the functionality of the app. This means that the playback won't work over and over again despite being able to connect, and if you've part-downloaded a playlist it will confuse the life out of the app.. You can pay £3.99/$3.99 per month and get better access to the features of the app, such as improved audio quality and unlimited skips through songs, but it's not really that much better than the free version.. Plus you need to sign up through a Nokia account (you can do it through a Microsoft login, but that's not quite integrated yet, which leads to an email asking you to sort out a Nokia account still) which seems a bit last century nowadays.. There are plenty of decent apps from Nokia and Microsoft to download (or are pre-installed on the phone) that really add to the functionality though - everything from Video Tuner (which allows you to easily make more shareable videos) to Nokia Beamer (an awesome app that lets you mirror your phone screen on any internet-connected device in the world) so at least the Windows Phone experience is working hard at its own apps to make the experience more enticing.. Nokia needs to work out what it really wants when it comes to wireless charging. Enabled in the Lumia 920 , it's been stripped out of subsequent light-named smartphones.. It's back in the Lumia 930, and as such adds a huge amount of heft to the design, apparently. I get that Nokia decided to let it be an option extra in recent models, in the shape of a snap-on case, as that gave consumers choice.. Sadly, it seemed that they chose to not use it, so Nokia has made it mandatory once again. It's great to see, and even better that there's a wireless charging pad in the box - THAT'S what consumers need to make wireless charging happen.. The wireless charger comes in the box. However, I don't get why it's added so much depth to the phone (assuming that's the reason), as other models, such as the LG G3 , can manage it in a very slim profile.. But overall wireless charging being part of the set up is a big, big win. Not needing to plug your phone in for the first time as you put your head on the pillow is really awesome - this is the kind of futuristic stuff I was expecting years ago..

Nokia Lumia 930 review - the last great Nokia smartphone? 2. Windows Phone 8.1 & Apps 3. Battery life could be better, but this is still one of the best Windows phones ever made. Processor: Quad-core 2.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800, Screen size: 5in, Screen resolution: 1,920x1,080, Rear camera: 20-megapixel, Storage: 32GB, Wireless data: 4G, 3G, Size: 137x71x9.8mm, Weight: 167g, Operating system: Windows Phone 8.1. Display Performance & Benchmarks Battery life. The Lumia 930 was arguably the last great. handset before Microsoft took over Nokia. It's since been replaced by the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL , both of which come with Windows 10 straight out of the box, but neither of them really do their operating system justice, as their slow, stuttering performance pales in comparison to the super slick speeds of the now defunct Lumia 930.. However, you can still pick up a Lumia 930 if you hunt around, as you can still get one from Amazon. That's a lot more palatable than the £420 you'd have to fork out for the Lumia 950, and you get to choose from a wide variety of eye-searingly bright colours, too, something that the all-black Lumia 950s are entirely lacking.. The Lumia 930 is also eligible for a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile as well, but it's worth noting that it won't be able to take advantage of certain new Windows 10 features. Chief among them is Continuum, as this requires a USB-C port. The Lumia 930, on the other hand, only has a standard micro USB port for charging and data transfer, so you won't be able to connect it to a monitor and turn it into a miniature PC by attaching it to Microsoft's Display Dock .. However, despite being almost two years old, there's still plenty to like about the Lumia 930. Available in the same highlighter green and orange cases as the rest of the 2014 Lumia range, including the excellent Lumia 735 and Lumia 630 , it certainly stands out from the crowd. 5in OLED display with a 1,920x,1080 resolution, a 20-megapixel PureView camera, 32GB of storage and its internal hardware is among the fastest we've seen for a Windows handset.. It's a huge improvement over Nokia's previous flagship model, the Lumia 925 , so much so that the Lumia 930 even has the potential to go head to head with Nokia's two phablets, the 1320 and 1520 .. One thing that hasn't changed is Nokia's excellent build quality. The Lumia 930 may measure a chunky 9.8mm thick and weigh a hefty 167g, but its solid metal rim and sealed matt rear make it feel incredibly sturdy and well-made. It's more angular than the Lumia 925, but the design is way more desirable.. That sense of allure is only heightened by the Lumia 930's 5in Full HD OLED display. OLED panels typically have much better colour accuracy, contrast and black levels than IPS displays as each individual pixel has its own backlight, and the Lumia 930 is no exception.. Our colour calibrator showed it was displaying a perfect 100 per cent of the sRGB colour gamut and black levels were a near perfect 0.05cd/m2. This meant colours looked incredibly rich and vivid and text was pitch black. Whites were perhaps a little pinkish compared to other OLED displays such as the Motorola Moto X , but we'd rather the screen looked warm than overly cool.. Contrast was a little low at 4,854:1 (other OLED displays such the Lumia 1020's have measured a massive 37,507:1), but we were still able to see a high level of detail in our darker test images. Likewise, the phone's wide viewing angles meant we could see the screen clearly regardless of whether we were looking at it face on or had it lying down on the table beside us. Peak brightness was also a modest 271.10cd/m2, but we found this was still more than enough to use the Lumia 930 outside without forcing us to strain our eyes to see the screen clearly.. Performance was superb for a Windows Phone handset. With its quad-core, 2.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor and 2GB of RAM, browsing the web has never felt smoother on Windows Phone. Pages loaded in an instant and the Lumia 930 even took image-heavy desktop sites such as The Guardian home page in its stride. There was no stutter whatsoever when we were zoomed in and panning round quickly, and scrolling up and down pages was very responsive. The operating system was equally silky, with apps opening quickly and showing no signs of lag or stutter as we swiped between screens.. This was reflected by the Lumia 930's lightning fast score of 512ms in our SunSpider Javascript benchmarks, which is the quickest time we've seen for a Windows phone and almost twice as fast as the Lumia 925. This score even beats the Lumia 1520, which until now was our reigning Windows performance champion, meaning the Lumia 930 has all the power of a high-end phablet tucked into a normal-sized handset. To compare it with the current crop of flagship Android phones, the only other handset we've tested with a faster score is the Samsung Galaxy S5 , putting it ahead of both the HTC One (m8) and LG G3 .. Although our go-to graphics tests, 3DMark Ice Storm and Epic Citadel, still aren't available on Windows Phone, we were still able to put the Lumia 930 through its paces with GFXBench. It scored 20fps, dropping behind a Snapdragon 800-equipped Samsung Galaxy S4 which scored 26fps. Realistically, however, the limited number of games available on Windows Phone will all play smoothly on the 930, even with the Full HD resolution, and the only one that might cause frame rates to fall slightly is the demanding Halo: Spartan Assault.. Fortunately, this amount of power doesn't take its toll on the Lumia 930's battery life, as its 2,240mAh battery lasted 10 hours and 24 minutes in our continuous video playback test with the screen set to half brightness. It's not quite as spectacular as the Lumia 1020's twelve hour battery life, but you should still be able to get a whole day's use out of the Lumia 930 without having to return it to the mains mid-afternoon. The Lumia 930 includes wireless charging, too, so with a compatible charging plate you can top up without having to reach for a cable first..

Nokia Lumia 930 review: like the Icon, but better. TomTom intros GO 930T and 730T with Lane Guidance and IQ Routes. Nokia Lumia 930 review: like the Icon, but better. Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia is now bearing fruit , but as often happens when big companies merge, there aren't enough jobs to go around. More than 10,000 former Nokia employees are due to be laid off by the end of the year , but their legacy will live on for a time in the Lumia 930 : one of the last all-Nokia creations. If you live in the UK, then you already know where to get the flagship Windows Phone, but the more important question is whether you want one. We've already taken a deep dive on the 930 in our review of the Lumia Icon , which is essentially the same phone, just exclusive to Verizon in the US. Let's revisit the good, the bad and the competition.. Gallery: Nokia Lumia 930 review | 15 Photos. Top specs with strong performance to match. The Lumia 930 is arguably the best Windows Phone on the market, with a brilliant camera and top-end specs. It's also an improvement over the US version, the Lumia Icon, thanks to broader LTE band support and a free wireless charger in the box.. Chances are you might not want to pay up front for the handset in the UK, and should you journey the contract route, there's almost no delineation in prices across the top handsets. For around £30 per month, you're free to pick your poison. And if your poison happens to be a top-spec Windows Phone with unmatched performance, a great display and a camera that's practically as good as they get, well, prepare to get very sick indeed.. The Lumia 930 won't leave many wanting when it comes to raw specs, but it could leave the more design-focused buyer a tad underwhelmed. It's a fairly inconspicuous marriage of Gorilla Glass 3, aluminum and polycarbonate, with the latter adding a dash of Lumia color to brighten up the proceedings. If you're not a fan of Nokia's more playful, plastic-clad models, then the 930's utilitarian look might be right up your alley. The aluminum band spanning the perimeter of the phone is a nice reminder you're dealing with a top-end device that deserves a dose of premium materials. A slight pillowing of the back panel makes the 930 comfortable to hold, and with a 5-inch display, it has much more agreeable dimensions than the 6-inch Lumia 1520. The smaller device is still relatively heavy at 167g (or sturdy, depending on how you look at it), but well within most people's tolerances.. Nokia Lumia 930 Dimensions 137 x 71 x 9.8mm Weight 5.89 oz. (167g) Screen size 5.0 inches Screen resolution 1,920 x 1,080 (441 ppi) Screen type OLED ClearBlack; sunlight readability enhancement; high brightness mode; Gorilla Glass 3 Battery 2,420mAh Li-Ion (non-removable) Internal storage 32GB External storage None Rear camera 20MP Zeiss, OIS, f/2.4, wide-angle lens, AF Front-facing cam 2MP sensor (1.2MP stills) Video capture 1080p/30 fps (rear); 720p (front) NFC Yes (with secure element on SIM) Radios Bluetooth v4.0 LE SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 (MSM8974) CPU 2.2GHz quad-core GPU Adreno 330 RAM 2GB Miscellaneous FM radio, GPS/GLONASS, micro-USB 2.0 HS, four-mic setup WiFi Dual-band, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wireless Charging Yes, Qi standard Operating system Windows Phone 8.1, Lumia Cyan. LTE Bands 1, 3, 7, 8, 20. The Lumia 930 launched already running Windows Phone 8.1, but the Icon, its US doppelganger, was built before Microsoft eased up on design requirements with the release of 8.1. As a result, the 930 is probably the last phone you'll see with capacitive navigation keys and a physical camera button alongside the standard power and volume rocker arrangement. Undoubtedly, one of the best bits of the external hardware is the 5-inch display: a 1080p AMOLED ClearBlack panel nestled under a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3. It's hard to fault, what with its great sunlight readability, viewing angles and color saturation.. You can check out our Windows Phone 8.1 review if you're unfamiliar with what the latest update to Microsoft's mobile OS brings, but the biggest features to note are the addition of a notification center and virtual assistant Cortana. The latter is still in beta in the UK, but that in itself means we shouldn't be far from a consumer-friendly release. Aside from the two main highlights that make for a much more competitive OS, the keyboard now supports swipe-based typing, and there are various other improvements to the core experience, like a new battery saver mode and redesigned calendar app, among others.. Being a Lumia, the 930 also reaps the benefits of Nokia's Cyan update on top of Windows Phone 8.1, which includes enhanced Camera, Creative Studio and Storyteller apps. Packing the heaviest hardware in Nokia's lineup, the 930/Icon and 1520 get some special treatment, like the Living Images photo feature that creates multi-frame moving pictures. Then there are the improvements to sound-recording quality when shooting video, as well as color temperature, low-light capture and autofocus when using the camera in general.. On the imaging front, the 930 has a more-than-capable 20-megapixel PureView camera with f/2.4 aperture. It's not quite on the level of the Lumia 1020 , but it's also not as inferior as the raw specs would suggest. Low-light performance is especially good, and Nokia's Camera app allows you to tweak deeper settings like white balance, ISO and shutter speed straight from the viewfinder -- things you may actually find yourself doing on a mobile with such a large sensor. While picture quality may be impressive, video is of a slightly lower standard. The overly skittish autofocus noted in our Icon review is much improved with Windows Phone 8.1, but auto-exposure compensation is still somewhat overactive. The audio that accompanies the video is basically as good as it gets, thanks to four microphones that focus on the sound in front of the lens and while canceling out what's behind it.. There's nothing negative to be said about the overall user experience. Windows Phone is designed to run smoothly on super-cheap hardware configurations, so with a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 and 2GB of RAM to work with, the 930 does it better than any. All that power isn't at the expense of running time, though, and the 2,420mAh battery will keep the 930 chugging along happily for at least a full day, even with intensive use. You can also juice it up wirelessly thanks to an integrated Qi coil -- every 930 comes with a wireless charger in the box , too, which isn't the case with the Icon. Incidentally, the Icon also doesn't support any form of LTE roaming, making it well and truly a Verizon-exclusive handset. The 930, on the other hand, works on bands 1, 3, 7, 8 and 20, which should take care of all needs, foreign and domestic.. For now, the Lumia 930 is simply the top of the pile when it comes to Windows Phone handsets, and with flagship status comes flagship pricing. Unlocked, you can currently pick up a 930 for £395 in the UK, but search around and you'll find the Apple iPhone 5c, HTC One M8, LG G3, Samsung Galaxy S5 and Sony Xperia Z2 all within roughly £50 of that price. As Verizon called dibs on the Icon , it's unlikely we'll see US carriers ranging the 930 any time soon. That said, if you're keen on the 930's wider LTE frequency support, unlocked models are available on Amazon from around $580 .. 930 , lumia 930 , lumia930 , mobilepostcross , nokia , nokialumia930 , review , smartphone , uk-feature , uk-reviews , windowsphone8.1.

There are three major form factors seen in mobile phones => bar phones, folding phones and sliding phones. 137 x 71 x 9.8 mm (5.39 x 2.80 x 0.39 in). SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) is a small card that contains mobile network subscriber's account information. This allows the phone using the card to attach to a mobile network. The SIM card is most commonly associated with GSM and UMTS mobile networks. Moving a SIM card from one phone to another allows a subscriber to switch mobile phones without having to contact their mobile network carrier. SIM cards can also be used by a phone to store limited amounts of data, such as phone numbers and text messages.. GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900. HSDPA 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100. LTE 800 / 900 / 1800 / 2100 / 2600. Display Technology => A number of display technologies and types used in mobile phones => TFT (Thin Film Transistor), IPS (In-Place Switching), OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode), AMOLED (Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode), Super AMOLED (an even advanced version of AMOLED), Resistive Touchscreen (Resistive touchscreens contain two layer of conductive material with a very small gap between them which acts as a resistance), Capacitive Touchsceen (Capacitive touchscreen technology consists of a layer of glass coated with a transparent conductor). Display Colors is refers to the number of different shades of colors that the screen is capable of displaying => 64K colors, 256K colors and 16 million colors, Obviously 16M is highest available range of colors and better than others. Pixel Density (PPI) is refers to the concentration of pixels on a particular display, measured in pixels per inch (ppi). Pixel density is calculated by dividing the diagonal pixel resolution of a display by its diagonal size, higher pixel density better display quality. Display Protection => Gorilla Glass is a special alkali-aluminosilicate glass shield with exceptional damage resistance that helps protect mobile displays from scratches, drops, and bumps of everyday use, It is always better to go for a smartphone with Gorilla Glass for that added protection and peace of mind. Camera is able to capture photographs and usually videos, The most important characteristics of a camera are the resolution (measured in megapixels), lens focus type (fixed or automatic), higher megapixel cameras are known to capture higher quality photos, but not always a good measurement of the photos quality. Flash Light => There is commonly two types of flash lights are used in camera mobile phones, LED Flash (LED flash offers lower power consumption with drive circuitry that takes up very little room, LEDs can be strobed faster than any other light source), Xenon Flash (xenon flash produces an extremely intense full-spectrum white light for a very short duration). Yes, 1080p@30fps, optical stabilization, stereo sound recording. PureView technology, carl zeiss optics, optical image stabilization, autofocus, dual capture, geo-tagging, face detection, panorama. OS => Every computer system run on a base software called Operating System (OS). Operating System controls all basic operations of the computer (such as smartphone, PDAs, tablet computers and other handheld devices). The Operating System allows the user to install and run third party applications (apps), apps are used to add new functionality to the device. UI or user interface of a device is the look and feel of the on-screen menu system. How it works, its color scheme, how it responds to button presses, all of these things are part of the user interface. Java for Mobile Devices is a set of technologies that let developers deliver applications and services to all types of mobile handsets, ranging from price efficient feature-phones to the latest smartphones.

Chipset is a group of integrated circuits designed to perform one or a more dedicated functions, often with real time computing constraints, Popular smartphones are equipped with more advanced embedded chipsets that can do many different tasks depending on their programming. CPU (Central Processing Unit) mostly known as processors, CPU processes instructions in order to carry out certain functions that make your device operate properly. Processors are often described as the brain of computers, smartphones and tablets, Smartphones and tablets rely on processors to carry out their every task, Processors are an incredibly important factor in selecting any type of computing device, including your smartphone. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a single-chip processor designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display, This includes things such as lighting effects, object transformations, and 3D motion. RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly, any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes that allows information to be stored and accessed quickly from random locations. RAM is the most common type of memory found in computer systems, smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices. Internal Storage is a data storage space (flash memory) mostly used in smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices where operating system, apps, music, photos, videos, files and other user data Is stored. Memory Card Slot is a special slot for inserting a memory card. Memory cards allow you to expand the phone's built-in memory, A memory card (sometimes called a flash memory card or a storage card) is a small storage medium used to store data such as text, pictures, audio, and video, for use on small, portable or remote computing devices such as mobile phones, mp3 players, digital cameras. Sensors are electronic components that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The specific input could be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure and location, The output is generally a signal that is converted to use in computing systems, a location sensor, such as a GPS receiver is able to detect current location of your electronic device.. Bluetooth is a wireless communications technology for exchanging data between mobile phones, headsets, computers and other network devices over short distances without wires, Bluetooth technology was primarily designed to support simple wireless networking of personal consumer devices. Wi-Fi is a popular wireless networking technology using radio waves to provide high-speed network connections that allows devices to communicate without cords or cables, Wi-Fi is increasingly becoming the preferred mode of internet connectivity all over the world. GPS The Global Positioning System is a satellite-based radio navigation system, GPS permits users to determine their position, velocity and the time 24 hours a day, in all weather, anywhere in the world, In order to locate your position, your device or GPS receiver must have a clear view of the sky. NFC (Near field communication) is a set of standards for smartphones and similar devices to establish peer-to-peer radio communications with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no more than a few inches. Wireless Charging (Inductive Charging) uses an electromagnetic field to transfer energy between two objects. This is usually done with a charging station. Energy is sent through an inductive coupling to an electrical device, which can then use that energy to charge batteries or run the device.. Yes, with A-GPS support and GLONASS. GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) is a packet oriented mobile data service on the 2G and 3G cellular communication system's global system for mobile communications (GSM), Generally, GPRS is used for the purpose of wireless data transfer, such as sharing pictures and videos or browsing the Internet via a mobile phone connection.

IM (Instant Messaging) is an exchange of text messages through a software application, it enable you to create a kind of private chat room with another individual in order to communicate in real time over the Internet.. Battery Type => Cell phones run on various kinds of batteries depending on the manufacturer, phone size or shape and features. There are basically four types of cell phone batteries => Lithium Polymer, Lithium Ion, Nickel Metal Hydride and Nickel Cadmium. Battery Capacity is a measure (typically in Amp-hr) of the charge stored by the battery, and is determined by the mass of active material contained in the battery. The battery capacity represents the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from the battery under certain conditions. Standby Time is the total amount of time that you can leave your is fully charged, turned on and ready to send and receive calls or data transmissions before completely discharging the battery. Talk Time is the longest time that a single battery charge will last when you are constantly talking on the phone under perfect conditions, Ambient temperature and highly dependent on the cellular network environment such as the distance to the closest cell network tower.

Which camera is right for you?. The Nokia Lumia 930 and Samsung Galaxy S5 are two of the best smartphone cameras you can get. Nokia has produced some of the most important phone cameras ever made, and with the Lumia 930 carrying the PureView seal of approval, we have big expectations.. But can it hope to better the Samsung Galaxy S5, a true powerhouse of phone photography? We’ve given the two a test drive to see which is really better in photographic terms.. We find the Samsung Galaxy S5 marginally easier to use than the Lumia 930 camera. All of Nokia’s higher-end phones suffer from the same problem – they use two camera apps.. You get the Windows Phone app and Nokia’s own camera app. Choice is good, but ultimately this is quite confusing when they appear similar enough to think you’ve just pressed the wrong button and ended up in the wrong part of the same app.. SEE ALSO: Best Windows Phone Round-up. Samsung actually cut back its camera app for the Galaxy S5. Lots of the extra modes have been cut back to make it easier to use, and you can customise the interface to put the modes you need at your fingertips. You can also do this in the Lumia 930’s standard camera app, but it is a little fiddlier to do.. However, for those really wanting to learn about photography from their phone, the Lumia 930 is much, much better. While having two camera apps isn’t great for beginners, the control the Nokia Camera app gives you is fantastic.. It goes over and above what you get from most other camera apps, letting you focus manually and set the shutter speed as well as fiddling with standard things like ISO and exposure compensation. With a bit of effort and know-how, you can get some creative results.. The only thing you can’t control is aperture, because the Nokia Lumia 930 aperture is fixed at f2.4. SEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy S5 vs Galaxy S4 One of the best parts of the Lumia 930 is the control you get with the Nokia Camera app. The interface is neat too, using rotary sliders to let you change settings. Some Samsung cameras offer something similar, but it’s not available in the Galaxy S5.. The Samsung Galaxy S5 offers relatively little manual control. You can tweak ISO, exposure and so on, but shutter speed and focus are handled by the phone itself.. The Nokia Lumia 930 has a higher-resolution sensor than the Samsung Galaxy S5. It uses a 20.7-megapixel sensor while the Samsung Galaxy S5 has a 16-megapixel camera.. However, it’s all-too-easy to overemphasise this difference. The Nokia Lumia 930 has a 20.7-megapixel 1/2.5-inch camera sensor that predominantly deals with 5-megapixel photos.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. Most of the information from the sensor is used, but it is boiled down to a 16:9 5-megapixel image to save space and reduce image noise. We saw a similar system in the Sony Xperia Z2 , a 20.7-megapixel that largely outputs 8-megapixel photos.. You can force the Lumia 930 to save full-res photos too, but these are actually 16-megapixel shots in actuality as the phone shoots in 16:9 while having a 4:3 sensor. You can’t readily access them from the phone either.. The Lumia 930 is not what it at first appears to be.. We also found that the Galaxy S5 is faster to shoot with than the Lumia 930. Shot-to-shot speeds are slower and focusing is marginally slower at times. This may be in part down to the processing required in downscaling images to 5-megapixel format – it’s something we also saw in the Lumia 1020 , and to a much greater extent.. The Galaxy S5 is helped on this front by its phase detection focusing , which stops the forward-back seeking that is used by the contrast detection system of the Lumia 930.. On the lens side, the Galaxy S5 is a bit faster, with an f-stop rating of f2.0 to the Lumia 930’s f2.4. Nokia uses a larger sensor to compensate for this actually relatively slow (among phones) lens, though.. In daylight, the Nokia Lumia 930 and Galaxy S5 are both accomplished photo takers. Colours are lively and well-saturated, exposure metering is fairly good and you can instantly tell the photos are from a good phone camera.. In common with other Lumia phones we’ve tried, the Lumia 930 has a slightly warm tone that gives shots a pleasant look. It could be seen as a deliberate stylisation, but it’s a minor one at best and it often leads to the Lumia photos looking a bit prettier than those of the Galaxy S5.. Where the Galaxy S5 excels is contrast and punchiness. Zoom into shots and you can see the difference in detail you get from a 16-megapixel S5 shot compared to a 5-megapixel 930 one. While you get far more fine detail with the Lumia 930 than you would from a ‘native’ 5-megapixel phone camera right down to pixel level, the Galaxy S5 gets you much more straight off the bat. This is improved if you dig out the full-resolution 16-megapixel Lumia shots, but let’s not forget that 5-megapixel shots are the Lumia 930’s real currency. SEE ALSO: Best Smartphones Round-up. Here we see the detail you lose in the Lumia’s downgrading of images to 5MP. The Galaxy S5 shot also offers higher contrast.. Get closer up to the subject and, once again, the phones perform well. The Samsung Galaxy S5’s clearer highlights bring out fine details in our macro subject below a bit more.. We also found that we were able to get a bit closer to the subject with the Galaxy S5, thanks to its slightly longer focal length. Where the Lumia 930’s lens has an equivalent focal length of 26mm, the Galaxy S5 has a 31mm-equivalent lens. That’s pretty ‘zoomed in’ for a phone, whose focal lengths tend to stay around the 26-28mm mark.. Phone makers try and sell wide angle lenses as a good thing, but for the kind of street-style photography most people do with their phones, something around the 35mm mark would actually be much better. You heard it here first, people.. For pure quality, we think the Galaxy S5 pips the Lumia 930 here, but they both do extremely well. SEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy S5 Tips, Tricks and Secrets The Galaxy S5 let us get close up enough to see the top of flower go a little out of focus, due it exceeding the camera’s depth of field. Crisp and colourful, the Lumia 930 can take some lovely-looking close-ups. However, the Lumia 930 has real usability win too. More experienced photographers will love being able to use the manual focus of the Nokia Camera app to take macro shots.. Our macro example was pretty easy to shoot as the subject takes up most of the frame, but it would be far more difficult if the subject was much smaller – in this case phone invariably try to focus on the background, even if there is a macro focusing mode. For actually taking around town for macro photography, we’d probably pick the Lumia 930 as a result.. HDR is an essential tool for the mobile photographer. It makes taking photos with light sources in the shot possible, and will sort out exposure issues in cloudy skies.. The Samsung Galaxy S5 has a dedicated HDR mode, but HDR has never been a big feature in Nokia phones. What you get instead in the Lumia 930 is a Backlight scene mode, which is the closest thing the Lumia 930 has to a real HDR mode.. But how to they compare? This is the area in which the Galaxy S5 puts the most distance between itself and the Lumia 930. The Galaxy S5 HDR mode is much, much better. SEE ALSO: iPhone 6 release date, news, rumours, specs and price The foreground appears underexposed as the Galaxy S5 tries to juggle between the super-bright sky and the other parts of the image. It hasn’t done too bad here without HDR, though.. Switch on HDR and there’s a complete change. The foreground is properly exposed, and only the area right around the sun appears overexposed. That there isn’t a particularly pronounced halo around objects is frankly amazing. While the foreground is reasonably clear, the sky is massively overexposed here. Part of the tree is obliterated. It’s probably better than ending up with a massively underexposed foregound, though.. The backlight mode has helped with the exposure of the sky, but the foreground is actually less well-exposed an there’s a weird yellow cast to it now too. It’s not a patch on the Samsung HDR mode.. One extra quick comparison: There’s a nice ‘larger than life’ quality to this HDR shot, but it’s not enough to blast the photo into pure fantasy-land stuff. The backlight mode doesn’t do nearly as well. The sky is overexposed, the foreground is pretty glum, and again we get that yellowy colour cast.. One way photographers make portraits pop is to use a wide lens aperture to produce a shallow depth of field effect, where the background appears blurry, making the subject pop all the more. Phone makers have tried to create this artificially in their latest phones, but how are the Galaxy S5 and Lumia 930 when producing a natural bokeh effect?. The Lumia 930 is a tiny bit better here, producing slightly more background blur. It is a little jittery compared to the Galaxy S5, but in mobile phones we’re happy for any effect, regardless of its character.. To get a significantly better shallow depth of field effect, you’d have to upgrade to the Lumia 1020, which we find to have more-or-less the best in this respect among ‘normal’ phones. SEE ALSO: Windows 9 release date, preview and Start Menu. Blurring levels are very similar, but the Lumia 930 effect is marginally more pronounced. What about low-light? This is traditionally the area in which phones really start to struggle. The Galaxy S5 and Lumia 930 tackle the problem rather differently.. Where the Lumia 930 has a dedicated Night scene mode, the Galaxy S5 instead uses something called picture stabilisation. It’s basically a simulated software form of optical image stabilisation that appears to involve stitching together numerous exposures in order to reduce noise and ramp-up detail. It takes a little longer as a result.. If you shoot with both phones in Auto, with the Galaxy S5’s stabilisation turned on, the Galaxy S5’s results are better. There’s less noise and loads more contrast, although dynamic range is a big issue. Check out the tree in the image below, which has been reduced to a flat black mass where there’s a bit more retained detail in the Lumia 930 shot.. SEE ALSO: Best Android Phones 2014 Round-up It’s dark but contrast is – as usual with the Galaxy S5 – great. If only there was a bit more shadow detail. The Lumia 930 Auto photo is less contrasty, but there’s a smidge more shadow detail. Turn on the Lumia 930’s mode Night mode and it all changes. Sony Xperia Z2, the Lumia 930 is very effective at making do with barely. Colour fidelity isn’t too bad considering what the. phone has to work with too – the lamp light is roughly on the money and. Boom – switch on night mmode and suddenly the scene is 400 per cent clearer. It looks more like dusk than night now, but sometimes clarity is all you’re after. In terms of a picture you’d actually want to use and share, the Lumia 930 Night mode is the clear winner, and it’s quicker to shoot with than the Galaxy S5’s stabilisation mode.. Actually zoom in and look at the photos critically, though, and you will see that the Galaxy S5 actually produces a load more detail. As near-unusable as the photo is as a whole, you can read the phone number pasted on the side of the van in the background. The Lumia 930 wins the night mode challenge, but the Galaxy S5 once again captures more detail. What about the flash? We try to avoid using the flash unless taking face-on portraits of people in very poor lighting, but it is useful at times. Both phones have an LED flash, but the Nokia Lumia 930 has a dual-LED one where the Galaxy S5 uses a single LED.. You might think that this would make the Lumia 930 much more powerful, but we found the Galaxy S5 to be a bit more powerful. However, the Lumia creates less harsh shadows and tends to blow out images a bit less.. There are no bad choices here. The Galaxy S5 and Lumia 930 both have good cameras. However, for the average point ’n’ shoot mobile photographer, we think better results will come from the Galaxy S5.. Its borderline-magic HDR mode, the simpler approach to the interface and the faster shooting times are all big wins. However, if you want to use your phone to find out more about photography, it’s all about the Lumia 930. The Nokia Camera app lets you take a much more hands-on approach to your photos that shouldn’t be undervalued.. Next, read everything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S6.
