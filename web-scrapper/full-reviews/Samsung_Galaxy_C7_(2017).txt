Mobiles / Samsung Mobile Phones / Samsung Galaxy C7 2017 Price in India. User Visits: 20 Compare. Samsung has always been the top dog when it comes to the smartphone industry and lately it has been launching some of the most impressive smartphones for a while now. In the mid-range segment, the brand has its C-series of smartphones taking the centre stage with affordable yet powerful handsets. The Galaxy C7 2017 is the latest iteration of its much popular Galaxy C7 and also happens to be the first dual camera phone from the brand in mid-range. We take a look at the pros and cons of the handset for those who are interested in it.. The Samsung Galaxy C7 2017 is one of the first smartphones from the brand to come with dual camera module. It comes with a 13MP + 5MP camera module on the rear panel, which makes for a good imaging experience with depth of field and photography modes. The handset also features a powerful 16MP camera on the front and has every type of photographer covered with this device.. One of the biggest gripe that every smartphone user had with the Samsung in past was mainly due to it heavily bloated Touchwiz UI, which dampened the whole user experience. However, fortunately Samsung was quick to take note of the same and has completely overhauled the interface. The new UI from the brand is called Experience and is no more as bloated as it was in the past. Combine it with the newest Android OS and you have a pleasant user experience in your hand.. Samsung has recently started paying attention to features that matter the most and the demands of the end user. As a result, the front camera, which has never been a priority for the brand in the past, has been vastly improved now a days. The Galaxy C7 2017 is a testimonial to this since it comes with a powerful 16-megapixel snapper on the front panel.. When you have a powerful smartphone in your hands, you have to make sure that the device has a battery that can power the device and deliver the required resource. However, the Samsung Galaxy C7 2017 falls a bit short in this department as it comes with a 2,850mAh battery. Be rest assured, you will need to charge the handset atleast once a day even before the day runs out.. The handset comes with the signature Samsung design and spec sheet that the brand is known for. If you are looking for a branded device, which has premium build and makes for a good users experience, Samsung Galaxy C7 2017 makes for a good option. On the other hand, there are better smartphones with equally good build quality available in the market from Chinese and Indian brands.. 29,990 (Expected Price) Samsung Galaxy C7 2017 is currently not available in any online store..
