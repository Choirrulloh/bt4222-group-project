Motorola has just announced two of its most anticipated smartphones : Moto X and Moto G. The company decided to stick to the previous names, keeping things simple by calling them 2nd Gen devices. The new Moto G has been launched at the price of Rs. 12,999 for 16 GB and is going on sale later today with special offers on Flipkart. The company said that last time around they sold 1.6 million devices through Flipkart for Indian customers, and this time they’ve made sure they have sufficient stock for prospective buyers. The 2nd Gen Moto G has a 5.0-inch 720p HD IPS display made out of Corning Gorilla Glass. Other improvements to the G include two front stereo speakers and an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 2-megapixel front-facing one. The new G will also now finally come with a microSD card slot, which is located underneath the back cover. It’ll still come with 16GB built-in storage, but an expandable memory slot is always nice to have. However, underneath is the same 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 processor and 2,070 mAh battery. The new Moto G still shoots in 720p. However, they considered going for 1080p video capability, to compete with the Xiaomi Mi3. It’ll ship with Android 4.4 KitKat and is upgradeable to Android L as soon as it is released. It does come with a few Motorola apps like Migrate, which helps you transfer old phone contacts to the new one, and Assist, which provides a voice-activated Drive Mode when you’re on the road.

Ketan Pratap , 14 November 2013. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. Motorola announced the Moto G at an event in Brazil on Wednesday. The Google-owned handset maker confirmed its intentions to get back into the Indian smartphone market in early January next year. -- Guy Kawasaki (@GuyKawasaki) November 13, 2013 Moto G - Google and Motorola's new budget smartphone. A tweet by Guy Kawasaki later confirmed that the Motorola Moto G dual-SIM variant will be making it to the Indian market, as well as Brazil. The tweet said, "#MotoG Dual SIM will be available in India and Brasil." Kawasaki confirmed the news via a question and answer session with Motorola .. #MotoG Dual SIM will be available in India and Brasil. While Motorola has confirmed the Moto G will be arriving in India, it has not revealed precise plans for the rollout. We expect it to be sold in India via Motorola's official online channels, much like the Nexus devices on the Google Play store. There has been no word on Moto G India pricing but considering US pricing of $179 for 8GB model and $199 for 16GB model, it can be expected to be priced around Rs. 20,000 in India, including various taxes.. The Motorola Moto G runs Android 4.3 out-of-the-box and the Google-owned handset maker also has confirmed that the smartphone will be getting the Android 4.4 KitKat by January 2014.. The Moto G features a 4.5-inch HD 'edge-to-edge' display with a resolution of 720x1280 pixels (translating to a pixel density of 329ppi) and boasts a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 screen. Powered by a quad-core 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 (Cortex-A7) processor coupled with an Adreno 305 GPU, the Moto G features 1GB of RAM. On the optics front, the Moto G sports a 5-megapixel rear camera along with an LED flash and also includes a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera. The rear camera supports HD (720p) video recording.. The Motorola Moto G also features water-resistant nano-coating on the inside and outside. The Moto G packs a 2070mAh battery, which Motorola claims can deliver up to 30 percent more talktime than the Apple iPhone 5s..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 1.0 out of 5 stars I will not buy Motorola again.. This has failed within 6 months. I mistakenly returned it to Motorola for repair as it was and is still under warranty. They claimed that there was "liquid damage". The phone has been rarely taken out of the house and has certainly never been submerged. The phone was returned in externally immaculate condition. If it cannot tolerate the UK high humidity, then it is not fit for purpose. Motorola forwarded it to their repair centre who then held it up for ransom. They said that it is not repairable and said that I could pay £14 to have it returned without being repaired or it would be destroyed. I asked them to return the SIM card (as there is credit on it) and the micro SD card. I have been very busy due to changing job and moving house, but now it is time to follow this up with Amazon.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Slow, terrible battery life: avoid like the plague!. The worst Android phone we have ever had. I bought this for my wife. Battery life turned out to be extremely poor. There were constant wakelocks keeping the phone awake, but now wakelock detectors and similar apps require root (thank you, Google!) so we couldn't identify the offending apps. We tried all the usual IT approaches of wiping cache, restoring to factory settings, etc, but battery life was still awful. On top of that, the phone was extremely, extremely slow for even the most banal tasks. It's simply unacceptable, especially because my wife is not a power user, and only uses a couple of apps on the phone. In summary: avoid like the plague!. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Motorola = crap.. Had it for 7 months, then one morning I wake up and it is stuck on a boot menu and no buttons work. Sent it into Moto who told me it was water damaged, so unless there was a rain storm inside my home during the night I dunno how.... so yeah, before that they made me pay the postage to send it to them and now want me to pay almost £15 to get it back not fixed. I'll avoid them in the future! The phone was decent, came a little laggy after time, freezing up every now and then but for the price I think it was a decent phone! Thankfully Amazon are being legends and refunding me the amount I paid for the phone because they don't agree with how Motorola have performed. So yeah, Phone = decent, Motorola = crap.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars moto g dual sim. Well, having received my new dual sim motorola smart phone with kitkat 4.4.4. its really good for its price point 5 stars there, would have like 16 gyg version but for some reason amazon are not selling that version ...why? so 4 stars there, only 1 gig memory could have been 2 gig 3 stars there, it is noticeable in speed times, sound is average depending on the broadcast received from various sound outlets i.e. bbc itv players etc it does vary a lot, plenty of apps, added a 32gyg micro sdcard you can transfer your apps to the that sd card no problem but not android main apps like gmail or any embedded apps, that does save space on your main 8 8gig sd, good clear calls on my sainsburys vodaphone pay as you go sim, taking the plastic back off very fiddly 2 stars there, Motorola are providing lollipop up 5.01 up date shortly for this phone all 2013/14 g x phones see their site to check that, that means it may more responsive then now under kitkat nice to handle, on off button is a bit crap to to use really hard on press to start the thing! works with bluetooth jam speakers, really good over all star marking is 4 stars , would I buy another one? probably yes because its not apple its affordable and affordability and freedom to choose what network you want not have to pay two years contract and paying twice as much!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars I had never previously used a smartphone and was suspicious of how useful they are. Firstly, I had never previously used a smartphone and was suspicious of how useful they are. I was prompted to go for this because of the dual SIM. (I took advantage of a free SIM through my TV/Broadband provider but also wanted to keep my existing PAYG SIM going). The phone was simple to set up and is very effective for the operations I want to use it for: watching and listening to music and films, internet searches, photos and video. I added a 32GB MicroSD card and this has given the phone a massive storage capacity for using when offline. The sound is very good from the speakers, although I would normally use headphones. The picture quality for HD is good, (considering the price) I have had no issues watching films, music videos and TV episodes and the slightly larger screen size is great. I am using the VLC Player (windows) app for viewing and listening & this is fine. Have also installed Flixster which runs fine on this device. I'm probably not using the phone to it's full potential, but have found it incredibly useful on a daily basis. Very good and would recommend to others thinking of taking the plunge into the Android pool!. Was this review helpful to you?. Would you like to see more reviews about this item?.

This is my first smartphone so I don't really have anything to compare it with but I couldn't be happier. The display screen is a perfect size and very clear and sharp. The sound is good although at times you do have to make sure your ear is properly positioned. I thought I was going to be greatly disappointed with the camera but it's fine for posting pics on social media. It can't replace my very good stand alone camera of course but for the price I think this phone rocks! It will be interesting to see what my tech buddy thinks of it as he's an iOS freak. I just don't want to pay big bucks for a phone at this stage and I'm more of an Android person anyway. by francis9110 10 Jan, 2014. I bought this phone for my 13yr old son, Its got a rubber case and screen protector on it and it spends most of the time on the sand at the local beach and then down at the skate park. He is pretty brutal and each morning when he gets up its still working, so for me its okay, I don't know much about the specs of the phone but hey he's not whinging at me so its got to be doing what its meant to be doing. At the moment everything is fine..... This item doesn't belong on this page.. Site Map Copyright © 1995-2018 eBay Inc.

Motorola Moto G Dual Sim (dual stand-by) je model koji funkcioniÅ¡e sa micro-sim karticama. Na trÅ¾iÅ¡tu se pojavio u januaru 2014. godine i karakteriÅ¡u ga odliÄni 4,5-inÄni IPS LCD ekran rezolucije 720 x 1280 piksela. Ima 1GB ram memorije, 8GB unutraÅ¡nje memorije za skladiÅ¡tenje, glavnu kameru od 5MP(sa LED blicem) koja snima video snimke u FullHD rezoluciji i pomoÄnu od 1,3MP koja sluÅ¾i za video pozive. PokreÄe ga Android verzije 4.4.2 (KitKat), a okosnicu hardvera Äini quad-core Snapdragon 400 procesor Äija jezgra rade na 1.2 GHz i pruÅ¾aju savrÅ¡eno iskustvo koriÅ¡Äenja Android operativnog sistema. Puna podrÅ¡ka za sve programe, igre, video i audio formate, koji dolaze putem Google Play prodavnice nije izostavljena, a joÅ¡ jedna od prednosti koja krasi ovaj model je veoma dopadljiv dizajn i kompaktne dimenzije koje predstavljaju jedan od prvih aduta ovog telefona kada ga prvi put uzmete u ruke.. Telefon nije los, imao je problema sa ekranom dok je bio na androidu 4.4.4, sad je sve ok, ali posle azuriranja na 5.0 android, kad se svetlost smanji ispod nekih 30% ekran pocne da treperi. inace radi solidno,gura sve igrice bez problema itd.. uglavnom preporucio bih ga, odlican je za svoju cenu..:D. Sony Xperia L1 Dual SIM 16GB. Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) Dual SIM LTE. Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) LTE Dual SIM SM-J510FN/DS. Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime Dual SIM 16GB. Postovani, da li imate dual sim model sa 16 GB memorije i kolika je njegova cena?. Pozdrav, da li imate (ili moze da se nabavi) single sim model? Pozeljno bi bilo od 16GB, ali ako ne, moze i od 8... Nameravam ovaj telefon da uzmem za suprugu, jer joj je potrebna dual sim opcija. Ono sto mi je jako bitno je da znam da smo zasticen u slucaju bilo kakvih nedostataka ili kvara, jer ipak nije beznacajna suma novca u pitanju. Zanima me kakva je vasa politika vezano za reklamacije, koliko se najduze ceka na popravku/zamenu? Pitam ovo jer koliko citam, motorola nema zvanican servis u Srbiji. Takodje me zanima da li su telefoni regularni u smislu, da li izdajete fiskalne racune? Slusao sam razne price da neke radnje ne izdaju fiskalne, pa je onda naravno problem i ostvariti garanciju bez toga. u ponudi imamo model Motorola Moto G 16GB Dual sim ( kliknite ovde za LINK ) i njegova trenutna (30.04.2014.) cena iznosi 219 evra, odnosno 25 510,00 dinara. u ponudi imamo single sim model od 16GB( kliknite ovde za LINK ). TakoÄe imamo i model od 8GB koji je trenutno nedostupan, odnosno nemamo ga na lageru. podatke moÅ¾ete proveriti u našem kontak odeljku(LINK) , matiÄni broj firme i proveriti u APR (Agenciji za privredne registre) kako bi bili sigurni da je sve regularno. Po Zakonu o zaštiti potrošaÄa mi smo duÅ¾ni da vam vratimo novac, ukoliko to zahtevate/niste zadovoljni kupovinom, u periodu od 7 dana od kupovine (ako ureÄaj nije fiziÄki ošteÄen) ako to ne uradimo moÅ¾ete da se obratite nadleÅ¾nim organima koji jako dobro rade svoj posao. Ali do svega toga ne bi trebalo doÄi jer, nama je cilj da su svi naši kupci zadovoljni - to nam jedino garantuje stabilno poslovanje. Uz kupljeni ureÄaj dobijate fiskalni raÄun, a period popravke zavisi od same vrste kvara jer neki zahtevaju kratak period od samo par dana, a neki i oko 10ak,15(otprilike), tako da Vam to ne mogu taÄno reÄi. TakoÄe smo po zakonu duÅ¾ni da Vam u garantnom roku obezbedimo ispravan ureÄaj ukoliko je nastao neki kvar na njemu koji ulazi u uslove garancije, što je takoÄe propisano Zakonom o zaštiti potrošaÄa. Za ova i sliÄna pitanja, moÅ¾ete pogledati LINK i LINK , a ukoliko budete imali nekakve dodatne nejasnoÄe, moÅ¾ete kontaktirati naš Call Centar na brojeve telefona 063.889.0000 / 064.554.0000 gde Äe Vam kolege pojasniti ukoliko Vas zanima nešto detaljnije. MobilniShop zadrÅ¾ava pravo brisanja pitanja sa sledeÄom sadrÅ¾inom: psovanje, vreÄanje, VELIKA SLOVA, liÄne poruke, reklamiranje, cene u zemlji i inostranstvu.. ta drugi kaÅ¾u o nama ?.
