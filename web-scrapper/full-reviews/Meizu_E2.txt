CNET también está disponible en español.. The Good Multicoloured backlight adds interest. Tough to beat on MB per dollar ratio.. The Bad Navigation can be tricky at first. The Bottom Line The 1GB Meizu E2 offers a fairly decent feature set and performance at a cheap as chips price.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. The Meizu E2 is a light (33 grams), compact device that combines an MP3 player, FM radio and voice recorder. It can play MP3, WMA and WAV files and comes with a cable for connecting to a PC's USB 2.0 port, wrist strap and a velvet carrying case.. It has a small LCD graphical display that has a multicoloured backlight that can illuminate the display in up to 999 different colours, which will probably make the Meizu very attractive to the younger end of the market. Each time a song is skipped or the volume is adjusted, the screen colour changes, which certainly gets the device noticed, especially in low light conditions.. The E2 has a small navigation joystick that can be used to skip forward, rewind or fast forward through tracks; the joystick can be pushed up or down to adjust the volume.. Navigating around the memory can be a little tricky at first. In order to search through the album folders, the joystick needs to be pressed and held down for a couple of seconds. If it is not held down the system menu appears, which allows you to customise the display, default sound mode and power management features.. The unit also has three multifunctional buttons. One doubles as an on/off switch and a pause/play button, the second switches the system between graphic equaliser modes while the third is used to start and stop the voice recording function.. With the joystick and other buttons protruding from the device, the E2 luckily has a hold switch on its reverse side. Use of the hold button is essential because simply sliding the device into a pocket or bag causes it to switch on and the battery to waste away.. The device comes with a graphic equaliser that contains eight preset levels including SRS, WOW and TruBass, plus one that can be manually adjusted by the user.. One of the E2´s outstanding features is its voice recorder, which acts like a high quality dictaphone and can be operated with a dedicated button. The quality of the microphone is excellent but the inability to connect an external microphone does let it down a little.. The E2's radio was a disappointment. The device uses the ear buds supplied to act as an antenna but tests found that reception was relatively poor when compared to alternative devices.. The E2 is powered by a single AAA battery, which according to Meizu can power the device for 17 hours, however we found that with the backlight on and under ‘normal´ usage, the device easily plays for a respectable 12 hours.. Oh yes, it does wish you a "Happy every day" before shut down.. The unit reviewed was the 1GB model which at May 2005 retails for AU$229. Two other capacities, the Meizu E2-256 and the Meizu E2-512, are available for AU$129 and AU$179 respectively.. Best MP3 Players for 2018. See All.

Meizu E2 Specifications ` Photos / Pictures Meizu E2 Performance Meizu E2 Video review Meizu E2 Will be later Official site Meizu E2 Firmware Meizu E2 Publication date: 2017-04-12 Now we do not have stock for this smartphone, but there are similar products which you can buy at a discount, for example:. Meizu E2 - a fake innovation?. It is difficult to confuse smartphones of the Chinese company Meizu with other representatives of the mobile electronics market. Corporate identity is traced in every product, and FlymeOS , worth of millions of positive feedbacks, allows the corporation to be one of the leaders. However, nothing should stand still, and fans of the company expect a real revolution from it. But does the producer justify expectations?. In the case of the hero of today's review, the situation is the most noticeable. It seems, the full-metal housing, a beautiful curved glass of an excellent 5.5-inches display, a fingerprint scanner - what else is needed for happiness? However, all of the above, we have seen more than once (it would be enough to recall M5 Note, M3E and other models). However, within the segment, this combination looks all the same remarkable, as well as the installed IPS-OGS -panel with a resolution in 1920 by 1080 pixels. The highest brightness and contrast, excellent image clarity guarantee exceptionally pleasant emotions from using the gadget.. The already tested in the recent M3X Mediatek MT6757 processor easily copes with demanding games and applications, but even in combination with 3/4GB of RAM and Mali T880MP2 video accelerator, the power reserve is sufficient only for the current year. But there will be no problems with a lack of memory, because even impressive 32/64GB ROM can be expanded with MicroSD -cards.. The 13-megapixel camera from Sony copes well with the photographic duties assigned to it. The quality of images is high, and at a daylight is close to the flagship. The 8-megapixel front camera also deserves compliments, it is ready to make hundreds of brilliant selfies for social networks. Still actual Android 7.0 OS , support for 4G, OTG, a USB Type-C port, a 3400mAh battery only increase the chances of the device for excellent sales, but from such an ambitious and interesting developer you expect something more..

Meizu the famous smartphone maker from China has recently launched a smartphone known as the Meizu E2. Features such as Helio P20 chipset, Flyme OS 6.0, 13MP rear and 8 MP front cameras makes it the most vying device.. The Meizu E2 has been officially released and it has taken up to the hilt of popularity in the Chinese market. Within two days, the company received over 3 million registrations for the Meizu E2 across China. The product has been priced at 1299 Yuan (Approx. Rs.12,095) for the 3 GB RAM version and 1599 Yuan (Approx. Rs.14,890) for the 4 GB RAM variant.. However, contrary to people's expectations for the phone being available in the global market, the company is insistent to keep the Meizu E2 primarily within nationwide circulation. As per their opinion, they first want to weigh its performance in the national market and see how it performs in terms of feedbacks from its users. Only on receiving a positive response they would consider launching it on a global scale.. In China, this is not the first time that such a step has been taken to measure the performance of a newly launched device. Yet, critics worldwide wonder why Meizu wishes to test out the E2 only within the Chinese territory, when they can take it globally.. What is more to it is, that Meizu has assured that although people might have to wait for the Meizu E2 to be circulated on a global level for some time, but they would indeed be able to try it out before long and enjoy using its features which Meizu has promised to be absolutely unique.. Till then, it is ineveitable for people around the globe wait for the company's official statement on their website about the global availability of Meizu E2 and stay calm trusting the company's policy. Let's just hope that product is indeed worth the wait and the company find reasons, more than one, to launch it on a global scale.. Read more news on this product. User Review : 2 Reviews.

Meizu E2 - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 ». This device does not actually run Android 7.0. is this available in south africa??????????????????????????????????????. Patricius, 05 May 2017 I am using Meizu almost 2years. And the Flyme is the best. This is one of the best value for money phone u can currently get (64gb/4gb), i brought it in china. The performance for Daily task is above average. Battery life is decent, fast charger from 20% to 100% in less then hour. You will get nice picture from the camera but not outstanding 8/10. You can't get wrong with the price. Adreno320, 24 Jun 2017 i want to buy Transformer editon All sold out even in China. i want to buy Transformer editon. Amit, 17 May 2017 Tell me some one about Meizu e2. About its processor camera battery backup and storage capaci... has the phone running 4G on 1800, 1900, 2300, 2500, and 2600. So it will probably 'work' with any major US carrier, although that will depend on how well that carrier has coverage for the 1900 band.. What are the specific 3g/4g bands. Amit, 17 May 2017 Tell me some one about Meizu e2. About its processor camera battery backup and storage capaci... more It has helio p20 processor which is better than sd chips and it has flyme ui which is buttery smooth.. Tell me some one about Meizu e2. About its processor camera battery backup and storage capacity. All about who can tell me about this phone????. Is this phone has ir blaster. Really Android 7.0 (Nougat) and we waiting international version? Or this is Yun OS and this is gsmarena mistake?. I am using Meizu almost 2years. And the Flyme is the best. This model is best looking from Meizu. I like new design from back cover. I prefer 5" but this model look really good. I hope that Meizu will make some similar model as E2 just with 5 inch.. Twatonk, 30 Apr 2017 Hahahah obviously it's MediaTek, I hope Meizu create their own Chipset as soon as possible. more i wish this device use chipset that support ClearMotion tho, like MTK6592(old),MTK6595(old),Helio X-series. my device altho old model, Meizu MX4(MTK6595), it has ClearMotion(need root to enable it), but still better than non-ClearMotion device, very nice watching videos (HW capable video player). i think no clearmotion on non-flagship mediatek chipset like P-series..what is ClearMotion? easiest to explain, 30fps video but with ClearMotion you watch like 60fps... [deleted post] And this surprises you why? Have you not seen Mac computer and Windows computer starting in the 80's till now. They completely merged in the end. Twatonk, 30 Apr 2017 Hahahah obviously it's MediaTek, I hope Meizu create their own Chipset as soon as possible. more At least it's better than the helio p10 that many companies are still using. For its price and specs this phone can rule the market. Behold new midranger flagship you stupid greedy companies like Samsung Sony and so.. Hahahah obviously it's MediaTek, I hope Meizu create their own Chipset as soon as possible. Good Phone in Great Price Release in India 4 GB RAM 64 GB Memory. It will Make Record for Sale.
