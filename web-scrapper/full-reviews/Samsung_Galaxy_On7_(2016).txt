Please enable JavaScript to view comments.. Samsung Galaxy On5 2016 and Galaxy On7 2016 Pass Through TENAA. As Samsung continues to hog the limelight in the upper ends of the market, the lower end of its product lineup. does not get as much love as it once did. Credit where credit is due, Samsung’s low end lineup made Android affordable to the masses, and were once prime choices before the Chinese took over this segment.. That being said, Samsung has been focusing aplenty on its lower-end lineup. Its J-series and On-series have been selling well in the Indian market, even if they aren’t the most competitive of devices. The average consumer finds the brand trustworthy, and Samsung’s after-sales are in much better shape than that of its competitors in the budget categories, so this comes as no surprise.. And the latest news on the block is that the On-series is in line for its 2016 refresh. This information comes to us through TENAA listings of the Samsung On5 2016 and Samsung On7 2016 , while specs for both the On5 2016 and the On7 2016 also surfaced on Geekbench and GFXBench respectively.. In typical Samsung fashion, the On5 2016 and the On7 2016 look the same as each other. But this time around, Samsung seems to have dropped plastic completely out of the picture. Previous On-series devices had a metallic mid-frame and a plastic back, but these images show a device that is more along the lines of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 , if that makes sense. The back seems to be a single piece metal, with top and bottom caps being out of plastic most likely to allow for radio transmission. What this means for the lineup is that the device will not have a user-removable back panel anymore, and possibly denoting a shift throughout Samsung’s budget and mid-end lineup.. As for the specs, the On5 2016 will likely come with a 5″ HD TFT display, a Snapdragon 617 SoC, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage with microSD. The home button will likely double up as the fingerprint scanner, while the battery capacity is pegged at 2,600 mAh capacity. For the camera setup, the phone will sport a 13MP rear camera and a 8MP front camera. The device will run on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with TouchWiz UI.. With the On7 2016, the screen gets bumped up to a 5.5″ FHD display (still TFT), while the SoC gets a bump up to a Snapdragon 625. The only other thing that changes is the battery capacity, which will now be 3300 mAh in capacity. Everything else internally remains the same.. The Samsung Galaxy On5 2016 and the Samsung Galaxy On7 2016 are on track to be released in China. They will also likely make their way to other regions where the previous On-series devices were sold.. What are your thoughts on the new refreshes in the On-series? Would you like to see Samsung change something in their mid lineup? Let us know in the comments below!. Samsung Galaxy On5 2016 Samsung Galaxy On7 2016.

Home Technology Gadget Reviews Samsung Galaxy ON7 2016: User Opinion and Review. Samsung Galaxy ON7 2016: User Opinion and Review. Smartphones are becoming an everyday essential for people no matter the brand or size.. If you are looking for an android phone which performs fast, has a good display, with a high-resolution camera, long battery life and you quite don’t have the budget, check out Samsung Galaxy On7.. Samsung Galaxy On7 is one of the newest models for Samsung Technology’s Samsung Galaxy On series. The series was launched in India in 2015 and has four phone models as of today— the Samsung Galaxy On 5, Samsung Galaxy On 5 Pro, Samsung Galaxy On7, and Samsung Galaxy On7 Pro.. Like any other Galaxy phones out on the market, Galaxy On7 has a wide viewing angle. It has a 5.5-inch TFT display with a 1280 x 720 or about 267 PPI pixel density resolution. It has the typical design of a Galaxy phone with the earpiece, 5MP front-facing camera, and a couple of sensors above the screen. Below is a physical home button in the middle with two capacitive keys on both side of it, just the usual set of keys for navigation and previously used apps.. At the back, the 13MP camera sits in the middle and on both sides of it are its LED flash and loudspeaker. The volume rocker is on the left side while the power or lock key is placed on the right-hand side of the device.. The top part was left clean with no single button while at the bottom end is where the micro-USB, microphone pinhole, and the 3.5mm headphone jack is placed.. Galaxy On7’s 13MP main camera and 5MP may not be the best in terms of speed and quality but it can produce photos that are decent enough in terms of colors and sharpness. Its autofocus is not also in its best version but the tap-to-focus feature comes helpful in speeding things up.. Another good thing about this phone is its above average battery life. A 3,000mAh battery powers the device and it could last two to three days in a daily use (calling, texting, taking pictures). If you like to play games and a heavy social media type of user, it could last for a day or a day and a half.. One of the best features this phone can offer is its large screen. The resolution and display may not also spectacular at 267PPI but its viewing angles are decent enough with minimal dimming at a further angle. As for the speaker and sounds, it’s like any other Samsung devices— not that loud with poor trebles and deep bass quality.. This may not be the best model. the Samsung Technology has produced but will do good for casual users who are looking for a device that has a large screen with nice design and good battery life, most especially at an affordable price of Php 8,990..

Samsung Galaxy On7 (2016) and Galaxy On5 (2016) lay bare upper mid-range features. Adrian Diaconescu August 10, 2016 3:57 am. More and more, Samsung defies our conventional expectations of how non-flagship, low-cost Android devices should look, and what they can afford to accommodate under the hood on a tight budget.. The entry-level Galaxy J2 (2016) pioneers a new LED notification system dubbed Smart Glow, also packing a hearty 1.5GB RAM, while the mid-end Galaxy C5 and C7 sport unusually stylish aluminum bodies , cranking up the memory to a colossal 4 gigs.. Next up, the 2016 editions of the relatively well-received (at least in China) Galaxy On5 and On7 are tipped to bump their own RAM counts up from 1.5 to 3GB, with powerful matching octa-core Snapdragon 617 and 625 processors respectively.. This is all essentially etched in stone early, mind you, courtesy of the FCC-equivalent Tenaa agency, as is the Full HD 5.5-inch display of the Samsung Galaxy On7 (2016), and the largely unchanged 720p 5-inch panel of the second-gen On5.. Both upcoming mid-rangers also feature solid 13 and 8MP cameras, running Marshmallow out the box, and allowing for 32GB internal digital hoarding (each) while holding up to 128 gig microSD cards. But perhaps the biggest surprise and most meaningful upgrade is their apparent replacement of faux leather, i.e. plastic, backs with covers made of metal. Not the greatest-looking metal, but a step forward in build quality nonetheless.. Sources: Tenaa (1) , (2).

With the Galaxy On7 (2016), Samsung seems to be aiming. for those who don’t want to spend more. on getting the company’s new Galaxy C handsets, which also feature metal bodies and have slightly better specs (like 4GB of RAM and a Super AMOLED display).
