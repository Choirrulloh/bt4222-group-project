Lenovo C2 Power price in Pakistan. Lenovo C2 Power's lowest price in Pakistan is {{productLeastPrices| currency:"Rs. The online store {{storeNameHasLeastPrice}} offers the best price for this Lenovo Mobile when compared among 7 sellers.. PriceOye DOES NOT sells mobile phones! We only help you save money.. Full Specifications of Lenovo C2 Power. IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors. microSD, up to 32 GB (dedicated slot). While flagships rightfully take their place as the true flagbearers of their manufacturers, it’s the value for money smartphones that are the most sought after ones due to the general affordability of the masses. Lenovo is doing its utmost to appease people in this category and its latest upcoming smartphone, the C2 Power, might just be the smartphone you’re looking for.. The Lenovo C2 Power is meant to target the cheap smartphones category. That automatically means that you cannot expect the craftiest of looks or build quality from this smartphone. The C2 Power’s front is analogous to many Huawei smartphones while its plastic finished back has its fair share of similarities with the Lenovo K5 Note. Its dimensions are not the best though as a 9.6mm width is not everyone’s cup of tea.. Its display is finely poised with a 5.0 inches IPS capacitive touchscreen with 294ppi pixel density. This allows a crisp 720p resolution that undoubtedly makes for one of the strongest points of the C2 Power.. If it’s cameras that you crave the most, the Lenovo C2 Power has got two excellent ones. The back camera features an 8 megapixel sensor with autofocus and an LED flash. Not as big as its lens suggests, it still is valuable for the amount you’re gonna pay for it.. Its selfie camera is one of its most promising features with a 5 megapixel sensor. Most smartphones tend to neglect their secondary cameras within this price range but thankfully, the C2 Power is not one of them.. The name of this smartphone contains the word “Power” so it’s no surprise that the device is powered by 1.0 GHz Quad-Core processor with 2GB of RAM. This amount of RAM is always great news and we believe that the built-in Android Marshmallow will run without many problems.. The smartphone houses dual-SIM capability while 16 gigs of internal storage expandable further is music to our ears. Its battery at 3500 mAh contains a lot of muscle and we expect the C2 Power to provide adequate battery life. Oh, it also supports 4G as well!. More Mobiles like Lenovo C2 Power.

Design Type called form factor refers to a mobile phone's size, shape, and style as well as the layout and position of major components of phone. There are three major form factors seen in mobile phones => bar phones, folding phones and sliding phones. SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) is a small card that contains mobile network subscriber's account information. This allows the phone using the card to attach to a mobile network. The SIM card is most commonly associated with GSM and UMTS mobile networks. Moving a SIM card from one phone to another allows a subscriber to switch mobile phones without having to contact their mobile network carrier. SIM cards can also be used by a phone to store limited amounts of data, such as phone numbers and text messages. Yes, GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900. Yes, HSDPA 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100. Yes,LTE band 1(2100), 3(1800), 5(850), 7(2600), 8(900), 20(800), 38(2600), 40(2300), 41(2500). Display Technology => A number of display technologies and types used in mobile phones => TFT (Thin Film Transistor), IPS (In-Place Switching), OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode), AMOLED (Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode), Super AMOLED (an even advanced version of AMOLED), Resistive Touchscreen (Resistive touchscreens contain two layer of conductive material with a very small gap between them which acts as a resistance), Capacitive Touchsceen (Capacitive touchscreen technology consists of a layer of glass coated with a transparent conductor). Display Colors is refers to the number of different shades of colors that the screen is capable of displaying => 64K colors, 256K colors and 16 million colors, Obviously 16M is highest available range of colors and better than others. Pixel Density (PPI) is refers to the concentration of pixels on a particular display, measured in pixels per inch (ppi). Pixel density is calculated by dividing the diagonal pixel resolution of a display by its diagonal size, higher pixel density better display quality. Display Protection => Gorilla Glass is a special alkali-aluminosilicate glass shield with exceptional damage resistance that helps protect mobile displays from scratches, drops, and bumps of everyday use, It is always better to go for a smartphone with Gorilla Glass for that added protection and peace of mind. Camera is able to capture photographs and usually videos, The most important characteristics of a camera are the resolution (measured in megapixels), lens focus type (fixed or automatic), higher megapixel cameras are known to capture higher quality photos, but not always a good measurement of the photos quality. Flash Light => There is commonly two types of flash lights are used in camera mobile phones, LED Flash (LED flash offers lower power consumption with drive circuitry that takes up very little room, LEDs can be strobed faster than any other light source), Xenon Flash (xenon flash produces an extremely intense full-spectrum white light for a very short duration). OS => Every computer system run on a base software called Operating System (OS). Operating System controls all basic operations of the computer (such as smartphone, PDAs, tablet computers and other handheld devices). The Operating System allows the user to install and run third party applications (apps), apps are used to add new functionality to the device. UI or user interface of a device is the look and feel of the on-screen menu system. How it works, its color scheme, how it responds to button presses, all of these things are part of the user interface. Java for Mobile Devices is a set of technologies that let developers deliver applications and services to all types of mobile handsets, ranging from price efficient feature-phones to the latest smartphones. Java is currently running on over 3 billion phones worldwide, and growing. It offers unrivaled potential for the distribution and monetization of mobile applications. Youtube is a popular free video-sharing website, Youtube is the largest video sharing site in the world, Millions of users around the world have created accounts on the site that allow them to upload videos that anyone can watch. Facebook is a popular free social networking website that allows registered users to create profiles, upload photos and video, send messages and keep in touch with friends, family and colleagues. The site is available in 37 different languages.. Chipset is a group of integrated circuits designed to perform one or a more dedicated functions, often with real time computing constraints, Popular smartphones are equipped with more advanced embedded chipsets that can do many different tasks depending on their programming. CPU (Central Processing Unit) mostly known as processors, CPU processes instructions in order to carry out certain functions that make your device operate properly. Processors are often described as the brain of computers, smartphones and tablets, Smartphones and tablets rely on processors to carry out their every task, Processors are an incredibly important factor in selecting any type of computing device, including your smartphone. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a single-chip processor designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display, This includes things such as lighting effects, object transformations, and 3D motion. RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly, any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes that allows information to be stored and accessed quickly from random locations. RAM is the most common type of memory found in computer systems, smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices. Internal Storage is a data storage space (flash memory) mostly used in smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices where operating system, apps, music, photos, videos, files and other user data Is stored. Memory Card Slot is a special slot for inserting a memory card. Memory cards allow you to expand the phone's built-in memory, A memory card (sometimes called a flash memory card or a storage card) is a small storage medium used to store data such as text, pictures, audio, and video, for use on small, portable or remote computing devices such as mobile phones, mp3 players, digital cameras. Sensors are electronic components that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The specific input could be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure and location, The output is generally a signal that is converted to use in computing systems, a location sensor, such as a GPS receiver is able to detect current location of your electronic device.. microSD, up to 32 GB (dedicated slot). Bluetooth is a wireless communications technology for exchanging data between mobile phones, headsets, computers and other network devices over short distances without wires, Bluetooth technology was primarily designed to support simple wireless networking of personal consumer devices. Infrared connectivity is an old wireless technology used to connect two electronic devices. It uses a beam of infrared light to transmit information and so requires direct line of sight and operates only at close range. Wi-Fi is a popular wireless networking technology using radio waves to provide high-speed network connections that allows devices to communicate without cords or cables, Wi-Fi is increasingly becoming the preferred mode of internet connectivity all over the world. GPS The Global Positioning System is a satellite-based radio navigation system, GPS permits users to determine their position, velocity and the time 24 hours a day, in all weather, anywhere in the world, In order to locate your position, your device or GPS receiver must have a clear view of the sky. NFC (Near field communication) is a set of standards for smartphones and similar devices to establish peer-to-peer radio communications with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no more than a few inches. HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is a compact audio/video interface for transferring uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from a HDMI-compliant source device to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device. Wireless Charging (Inductive Charging) uses an electromagnetic field to transfer energy between two objects. This is usually done with a charging station. Energy is sent through an inductive coupling to an electrical device, which can then use that energy to charge batteries or run the device. GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) is a packet oriented mobile data service on the 2G and 3G cellular communication system's global system for mobile communications (GSM), Generally, GPRS is used for the purpose of wireless data transfer, such as sharing pictures and videos or browsing the Internet via a mobile phone connection. EDGE (Enhanced Data GSM Environment) is a wireless network technology generally considered the next step in the 2G network offers data transfer rates up to four times faster than ordinary GSM networks, Generally, EDGE is used for the purpose of wireless data transfer, such as sharing pictures and videos or browsing the Internet via a mobile phone connection. Web Browser => a web browser is a software application used to locate, retrieve and display content on the World Wide Web, including Web pages, images, video and other files, The primary function of a web browser is to render HTML, the code used to design or markup webpages.. SMS (Short Messaging Service) is a text messaging service component of phone, Web, or mobile communication systems. It uses standardized communications protocols to allow mobile phone devices to exchange short text messages over the networks. MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) is a standard way to send messages that include multimedia content (audio clips, video clips and images) to and from mobile phones over wireless networks using the WAP protocol. Email (Electronic Mail) is a system for receiving, sending, and storing electronic messages, Similar to a letter, email is text messages that may contain files, images, or other attachments sent via the internet to a recipient by using applications and software prograps. An email address is required to receive email, and that address is unique to the user. IM (Instant Messaging) is an exchange of text messages through a software application, it enable you to create a kind of private chat room with another individual in order to communicate in real time over the Internet.. Battery Type => Cell phones run on various kinds of batteries depending on the manufacturer, phone size or shape and features. There are basically four types of cell phone batteries => Lithium Polymer, Lithium Ion, Nickel Metal Hydride and Nickel Cadmium. Battery Capacity is a measure (typically in Amp-hr) of the charge stored by the battery, and is determined by the mass of active material contained in the battery. The battery capacity represents the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from the battery under certain conditions. Standby Time is the total amount of time that you can leave your is fully charged, turned on and ready to send and receive calls or data transmissions before completely discharging the battery. Talk Time is the longest time that a single battery charge will last when you are constantly talking on the phone under perfect conditions, Ambient temperature and highly dependent on the cellular network environment such as the distance to the closest cell network tower.

Lenovo C2 Power (K10a40) tethering does not work. Float this Topic for Current User. Float this Topic for Current User. Message 1 of 18. Lenovo C2 Power (K10a40) tethering does not work. The tethering via WiFi or USB does not work.. Can connect to phone but there is no access to internet.. Tried with Windows PC, Linux PC, iPad, Android Tablet.. All them see the WiFi from the phone, but there is no access to internet.. The phone itself can access internet without problem.. Not sure if this happened after update to K10a40_S111_170505_ROW_WE.. Tried resetting network settings, as hinted in other thread, but problem remains.. 1 people also had this question. Message 2 of 18. Re: Lenovo C2 Power (K10a40) tethering does not work. The tethering via WiFi or USB does not work.. Can connect to phone but there is no access to internet.. Tried with Windows PC, Linux PC, iPad, Android Tablet.. All them see the WiFi from the phone, but there is no access to internet.. The phone itself can access internet without problem.. Not sure if this happened after update to K10a40_S111_170505_ROW_WE.. Tried resetting network settings, as hinted in other thread, but problem remains.. You mean that your other devices can connect to your phone but it don't have internet connection, right? Have you tried to resetting the APN Settings?. Message 3 of 18. Re: Lenovo C2 Power (K10a40) tethering does not work. Yes, the other devices connect to the phone SSID, but all them say there is no internet connection.. Yes, I have reset APN settings.. Note that the same SIM card tethers without problem when inserted in another phone (Samsung ACE2).. Also, when I try tethering via USB the other device says it is connected to phone, but that there is no internet connection.. Message 4 of 18. Re: Lenovo C2 Power (K10a40) tethering does not work. Yes, the other devices connect to the phone SSID, but all them say there is no internet connection.. Yes, I have reset APN settings.. Note that the same SIM card tethers without problem when inserted in another phone (Samsung ACE2).. Also, when I try tethering via USB the other device says it is connected to phone, but that there is no internet connection.. We can do Reset Network Settings. Go to Settings> Back up and Reset> Reset Network Settings. Message 5 of 18. Re: Lenovo C2 Power (K10a40) tethering does not work. I have Reset Network Settings again (I already told in my first message that I had done this reset).. The problem persist exactly the same: The other devices connect to the SSID from the phone but there is no internet connection.. Is there any way to downgrade the phone to the previous ROM version (K10a40_S106_161223_ROW_WE) ?. Message 6 of 18. Re: Lenovo C2 Power (K10a40) tethering does not work. Have you tried contacting your Service Provider regarding this? If this is the case, last resort would be performing a Reset. You can do it on Settings (un-check Automatic Restore) or do a Hard Reset .. Message 7 of 18. Re: Lenovo C2 Power (K10a40) tethering does not work. I doubt that the problem is with the Service Provider because another phone (Samsung) tethers without problems using the same SIM card that does not work in the C2.. I will try the Reset/Hard Reset method first. But at this moment I am on the move and I can not risk to do it right now.. If this method fails to solve the problem then I will contact the Service Provider, but my experience is that their technical support is very basic, so it will probably do more harm than good.. I will post the results when I have exhausted all the resources.. Message 8 of 18. Re: Lenovo C2 Power (K10a40) tethering does not work. I did the reset (settings->backup&reset->reset_to_factory_defaults) and it did not solve the problem.. I also did a hard-reset (power_off->key_combination->power_on->wipe_cache+wipe_data) and it did not solve the problem.. I contacted Service Provider, was told to change some APN settings. I brought the phone to the shop where I bought it.. Since it is in warranty they have sent it to 'repair shop'.. I will inform when the phone comes back.. Message 9 of 18. Re: Lenovo C2 Power (K10a40) tethering does not work. The tethering via USB does not work for me.. The phone itself can access internet without problem.. Tried resetting network settings, as hinted in other thread, but problem remains.. Also tried a factory reset but the problem remain.. The SIM works OK on a Samsung phone tethering via USB without problem.. Message 10 of 18. Re: Lenovo C2 Power (K10a40) tethering does not work. The tethering via USB does not work for me..
