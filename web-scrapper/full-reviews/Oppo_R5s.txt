Oppo has unveiled an upgraded variant of its popular super-slim R5 smartphone, dubbed R5s. Additionally, the Oppo R7 Plus is going on sale in limited markets.. The new Oppo R5s (see above) has been listed by the company's Europe site at EUR 199 (approximately Rs. 15,000), and notes that the handset will be 'coming soon on August 25'.. While the new Oppo R5s retains one of the highlight features of its predecessor - the 4.85mm thickness - it also brings few improvements. The R5s smartphone features 3GB of RAM, compared to 2GB of RAM on the Oppo R5 ( Review | Pictures ), and also comes with double the inbuilt storage, with 32GB instead of the R5's 16GB.. Rest of the specifications of both the handsets are identical. The Oppo R5s features a 5.2-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) Amoled display that offers a pixel density of 423ppi.

It sports a 13-megapixel rear camera with Sony IMX214 sensor; an f/2.0 aperture, and a LED flash. There is a 5-megapixel front-facing camera also on board.. Running the company's proprietary ColorOS 2.0.1 (based on Android 4.4 KitKat), it supports a single Micro-SIM. Similar to the R5 smartphone, the R5s doesn't support expandable storage.. There is 2000mAh battery on board, and the smartphone supports VOOC charging technology that is said to charge the battery from 0 to 75 percent in around 30 minutes. Connectivity options on the smartphone include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS/ EDGE, 4G, and Micro-USB. The Oppo R5s measures 148.9x74.5x4.85mm and weighs 155 grams.. In other news, Oppo R7 Plus is finally going on sale (via GSMArena ) in limited markets. The company in May had announced that the R7 Plus smartphone will be available at CNY 2,999 (approximately Rs. As of now, there is no word which are the specific markets where the Oppo R7 Plus (see below) will be going on sale.. The dual-SIM (Micro-SIM and Nano-SIM) supporting Oppo R7 Plus is powered by a 64-bit octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 MSM8939 (quad-core 1.5GHz Cortex-A53 and quad-core 1GHz Cortex-A53) processor; 3GB RAM; Adreno 305 GPU; 13-megapixel rear camera with f/2.2 aperture and ISOCELL image sensor technology, and 8-megapixel front-facing camera with f/2.4 aperture..

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

The super thin metallic-bodied Oppo R5 is back as the Oppo R5s with improved specs and updates.. When the Oppo R5 was released, it was the world's slimmest phone at 4.85 mm body. It took the world by storm with its stunning slimness and smooth good looks. Now, it has been upgraded with better specs but inside the same slim casing as Oppo R5s.. The areas that were upgraded were the RAM - now resized from 2GB to 3GB - and the internal storage, which was expanded from 16GB to 32GB.. In the US, the Oppo R5s will be available from its online store for $220 and in Europe, it will be priced at Euro 199.. At present, the Oppo R5s will be available in grey colour only.. The Oppo R5s has the following specifications:. Design -Super slim casing, metallic body of width 4.85 mm Display - 5.2-inch screen with resolution of 1080ppi AMOLED Display. Camera - Rear 13-megapixel camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, Powered by - Snapdragon 615 processor Launcher- Skin - ColorOS 2.0 (based on KitKat). RAM and Storage -3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Connectivity â WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth Dual SIM with Micro SIM and GSM type.. There are two disadvantages of the new Oppo R5s. Firstly, it does not have the support of 4G LTE bands in the United States. Secondly, the Oppo R5s is still running on the older version of Color OS 2.0 that's based on an even older Android KitKat. Why it doesn't have ColorOS 2.1.3i update is a mystery.. Some would say that it is a great disadvantage for the Oppo R5s to not have the latest launcher, which includes Air Gestures for easy navigation and an Eye Protection mode for those who read alot on their mobiles. Still, at $220, it's a bit cheaper than some phones and worth a try.. Televangelist Benny Hinn Admits Going Too Far With Prosperity Gospel in Wake of Billy Graham's Death.

Nagy August 22, 2015 8:54 am. Remember the OPPO R5 ? It was the world’s thinnest phone, until it wasn’t anymore. Still, not bad at 4.85mm, maybe even too thin for some. Well, apparently, the Chinese phone maker pulled an iPhone by adding an “s” to the device’s name, and so we have the OPPO R5s. Well, that’s not the only change, of course, and the phone is wearing a “coming soon” label on the manufacturer’s website.. You’ll be able to easily tell the OPPO R5s apart from the R5, as it comes in grey, opposed to the silver R5. It keeps all the features, including the overall aspect and measurements, and also keeps most of the predecessor’s specs too. However, OPPO added an additional gig of RAM for a total of 3GB, and doubled the internal storage to 32GB (still not expandable).. What hasn’t been changed is the octa-core. Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 MSM8939 clocked at. 1.5GHz, 5.2-inch Full HD screen, 13MP camera, and everything else, just to name a few. It is still a neat little phone, don’t you think?

Mobiles / Oppo Mobile Phones / Oppo R5s Price in India. User Visits: 4 Compare. Phase changing chassis Metal unibody 4,85 mm thin VOOC Flash Charging. Non expandable storage Non removable battery. Oppo is one of the first ever Chinese handset manufacturers to have set foot in the Indian smartphone domain.

The design of the Oppo R5s surely manages to impress ta first glance with a metallic body and ultra slim profile. Oppo R5s has a metal unibody that is just 4.85 mm thin and thus makes it feel premium in one's palm. Oppo claims that the device is made of phase-shifting material is made of metal, resin and other composite materials, which absorbs any excessive heat generated by the handset. This is a huge advancement since Android devices tend to heat up often.. Oppo has equipped the handset with a 5.2-inch display that has wide angle 80 degree visibility for an enhanced visual experience. The display of the handset further offers full HD resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels for further enhancement in visual experience. Also, the handset display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass layer.. The performance of the handset is quite praiseworthy since it has been equipped with an Octa-core processor with a clock speed of 1.5 GHz. Moreover, the handset has enough RAM of 3 GB to handle anything that is thrown at it. The device is backed by a 2000 mAh battery that can easily last a day and with VOOC flash charging, it gets even better.. On the camera front, the handset maker has equipped the device with a 13 megapixel camera on the rear panel. The primary snapper of the device is equipped with features like after focus, Pure Image 2.0 engine, photo stitching to capture 50 Megapixel images and fast focus for an enhanced photography experience. The front panel of the handset houses a 5 Megapixel selfie snapper and comes with beautification mode.. Oppo R5s comes with support for both 4G LTE and 3G connectivity to allow fast speed Internet to its users. There are other features like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, microUSB and aGPS as well in this handset for the convenience of the user.. It is expected that the new device will be placed in INR 15,000 price segment, which is quite aggressive in Indian handset market. The handset will be competing with the likes of Motorola Moto G 3rd Generation, Xiaomi Mi4i, Samsung Galaxy J7 and Asus Zenfone 2.. Oppo has managed to tick all the right checkboxes when it comes to R5s in terms of specifications and hardware. However, everything depends on the pricing of the handset by Oppo and if indeed it is priced under or aroudn INR 15,000, it is going to be one of the best buy.. 29,990 (Expected Price) Oppo R5s is currently not available in any online store..

more ... more .... more ... more .... Ultra-thin Oppo R5s now available to buy in the US. Ultra-thin Oppo R5s now available to buy in the US. posted by Florin T.. Tags :. Oppo today started selling the R5s , a new Android smartphone that the company announced last week. The handset can be bought in the US and many other countries around the world, and, for a limited time, it's sold for $220 (unlocked). The discount is available until August 27. The Oppo R5s is an upgraded R5 , coming with more RAM (3 GB) and more storage space (32 GB). Other than that, the R5s isn't different from its predecessor, thus being a 4.85mm-thin, 5.2-inch 1080p smartphone. The handset is powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor, further offering a 5 MP front-facing camera, a 13 MP rear camera, and a 2000 mAh battery. Unfortunately, at the moment, the Oppo R5s seems to be running Color OS 2.0, which is based on Android KitKat. However, we assume an update to Color OS 2.1 (based on Lollipop) will be available at some point. It's worth noting that the Oppo R5s doesn't support US LTE bands, so you'll have to make do with HSPA (on AT&T or T-Mobile ). Another new Oppo smartphone that will soon be available in the US is the 6-inch R7 Plus. Is anyone interested in getting an Oppo handset?.
