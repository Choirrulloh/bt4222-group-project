CNET también está disponible en español.. BlackBerry Torch 9850 (Sprint) review:. The Good The BlackBerry Torch 9850 is a sharp-looking, dual-mode world phone with a good camera and offering 720p HD video playback.. The Bad Call quality, speakerphone, and general performance on the BlackBerry Torch 9850 hit some snags.. The Bottom Line With its full touch screen and fair price tag, the BlackBerry Torch 9850 shows that RIM is ready to compete with others in Sprint's lineup, although it's not without its flaws.. Photo gallery: BlackBerry Torch 9850 (Sprint). Just when we were wondering when BlackBerry would end its smartphone dry spell, RIM announced not one, but four new smartphones for U.S. release, including the BlackBerry Bold 9930 and the full touch-screen cousin to the Torch, the BlackBerry Torch 9850. (AT&T has a version of the latter called the Torch 9860 .). RIM's history with all-touch handsets that don't carry its trademark keyboard has been spotty; it flew by the mark with its inaugural effort, the BlackBerry Storm , which turned us off with its lack of Wi-Fi and its awkward SurePress screen technology that required you to click the touch screen to select, the way you would a button. The revised Storm 2 was an improvement, with Wi-Fi, double the memory, and some performance fixes, but it still struggled to stand up to the competition.. Two years later, RIM has thankfully learned from the embarrassing mistakes and has wisely left the Storm brand name whirling in our memory, even though the Storm series is more this full screen touch-y Torch's true ancestor. Regardless, the new attempt has a nice 3.7-inch display, a 5-megapixel camera with 720p HD video capture, a 1.2GHz processor, and dual CDMA/GSM mode for international travelers.. The specs place it in the upper middle range of smartphones, and the price matches fairly well at $149.99 with a new two-year contract. However, its debut cost is the same, $50 less, or $50 more than a handful of more dressed-up Android handsets like the HTC Evo 3D , the Samsung Epic 4G , and Samsung Nexus 4G , respectively. That said, prices do drop with sales, and penny-pinchers may see the Torch 9850 recede a bit with future promotions if they're patient. The Torch 9850 will be available August 21.. In terms of looks, the Torch 9850 is the maverick of the BlackBerry family, and that's no bad thing. While the most recent crop of BlackBerrys feature squarer corners, including the slide-up Torch 9810 for AT&T and Sprint's Bold 9930, this full-screen Torch 9850 embraces sharp angles, with top and bottom edges pointed enough to slice through soft cheese in a pinch. The glossy black front is framed in shiny silver along the spines and back. A soft-touch finish smoothes out the black back cover. It's one of the sexier BlackBerry designs, and despite those sharp tips, the Torch 9850 is comfortable in the hand and on the ear.. The BlackBerry Torch 9850 is RIM's largest all-touch-screen smartphone to date.. While it's no jolly black giant, the Torch is no miniature, either. It stands 4.7 inches tall by 2.4 inches wide by 0.45 inch thick and weighs 4.8 ounces. This Torch has the largest BlackBerry touch screen to date, at 3.7 inches. With a WVGA screen resolution (800x480 pixels) and support for 16 million colors, the Torch 9850's screen looks very sharp and clear. We were also impressed with how the screen handled direct sunlight. From most angles, the screen was bright enough at 70 percent to easily send e-mails.. Directly above the screen is an LED indicator light that glows red when you've got a new message waiting. At the top is the lock button. Beneath the screen, five raised hardware buttons correspond to the dialer, the Menu, the Back, and the Power/End buttons. The center select button doubles as an optical track pad for navigating the screen without smudging it up.. The phone's sides are slickly contoured. On the right are three thin, almost sharp protrusions of a rubberized material; together they make up the camera shutter button (which you can also set as a convenience shortcut key) and the volume rocker. It's a very stylized look that proves RIM is branching out with an edgier industrial design, but we can't say the buttons are our favorite to use. The right spine is also home to the 3.5mm headset jack. On the left you'll find the Micro-USB charging port.. The back side houses the 5-megapixel camera lens and the flash. Slip off that back cover to reveal the microSD card slot that accepts up to 32GB external memory. If you're traveling abroad, you can slip in a GSM SIM card for quad-band support, which makes the Torch 9850 a convenient world phone for business travelers.. The BlackBerry Torch 9850 runs RIM's new BlackBerry OS 7 operating system, with its new Liquid Graphics display, voice-activated universal search, and more. You can read about it in greater detail in this review of the BlackBerry Torch 9810 .. Since there's no physical keyboard, the Torch 9850 employs just the virtual keyboard. Onscreen buttons were on the smallish size overall, but on par with the onscreen keyboards we've seen time and again on many other smartphones. Although accuracy is hard to achieve when typing quickly on a small, flat screen, the virtual BlackBerry OS 7 keyboard did a very good job making correct suggestions and replacements, even with contractions. Spell-checking was a breeze and placing punctuation didn't interrupt our flow. Although a physical keyboard would probably be more comfortable for longer compositions, we felt confident texting and e-mailing.. Before we drill down to particulars, let's get the basics out of the way. The Torch 9850 is equipped with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth support, and GPS. The communication tools include the signature BlackBerry e-mail that supports Web mail as well as support for the BlackBerry Enterprise Server that secures and encrypts corporate e-mail. There's also text and multimedia messaging, instant messaging, posting to social networks like Twitter and Facebook, and an integrated inbox that lets you compose a message using any of those aforementioned channels.. Shiny plastic and metal accents, sharp ridges, and a mix of textures bump up the Torch 9850's style appeal.. In addition to voice calls, there's a voice recorder and support for voice commands. OS 7 also adds voice input to its universal search, a feature that lets you control when to stop recording by pressing a button when you're done. It worked well in our tests.. As with the Storm 2 before it, the Torch 9850 boasts a dual-mode functionality for its globe-trotting faithful, which will allow it to automatically switch from Sprint's dual-band CDMA network (you're locked into this while Stateside) to the international quad-band GSM networks. Just keep in mind that you might be tied to Sprint's overseas roaming partners while abroad.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

It's a beautiful part of Italy, a majestic park split by one of the most historic racetracks in the world, and it was also the codename for this rather more homely looking phone. This is a handset that would go on to be known by many names (Storm 3, Touch...) before receiving its final moniker: Torch 9850. Why all the pseudonyms, and why choose to confusingly overlap this with the somewhat similar but rather different Torch 9810 that's also officially launching today?. Maybe RIM didn't know what to make of this keyboard-free phone. Maybe the company wanted to distance itself from the Storm. Or, maybe what we have here is a smartphone that's trying to find an identity by sadly ditching the feature that, for many, makes a BlackBerry a BlackBerry: the physical keyboard. How does this smoothie compare to the others, and is it worth sacrificing all the QWERTY wonder found within the 9810? Read on to find out.. Gallery: BlackBerry Torch 9850 | 21 Photos. Solid, comfortable designGreat call performanceBright 3.7-inch LCD. Mediocre on-screen keyboardBlackBerry 7 already feels datedSomewhat limited app selection. if you're down with BlackBerry for the long-haul, you could do worse than the Torch 9850.. Hardware We'll just get this out of the way: the Torch 9850 is not a particularly good-looking phone from the front. The design concept is that of a "waterfall" of glass flowing over the device, a seamless, curving pane that welcomes the curious, clumsy imprint of your fingers. That's all well and good, but that purity of flow is ruined by four oddly proportioned buttons and an optical touchpad at the bottom, sticking out of this current like a bunch of bricks. That's not to say that physical controls can't look nice -- the set on the Droid Charge look rather good and fit in with the shape of the phone. Here, though, they're just sort of all in a row, like a five-year-old's first attempt at Bedazzling a mouse. Capacitive buttons hidden beneath the glass would be far more agreeable to our aesthetic sensibilities, but these physical inputs at least feel comfortable to the touch. Oh, and they light up pretty, too. If you want something visually appealing you'll have to flip the phone over. There's a lovely gunmetal band that flows all the way around, looking far more classy than the average touches of blingy plastic chrome used to brighten up other handsets -- indeed, many with RIM provenance. That polished band runs around a recessed, matte section that is, for the most part, a thin metal battery door. It springs right off with enthusiasm when a tiny button is pressed. Under here is the 1,230mAh battery that powers RIM's new trifecta of smartphones, and a slot for a microSD card -- 4GB comes by default, paired with 4GB on the inside. Dig a little deeper and you'll find a SIM tucked away, needed to help this phone achieve its world-conquering intents. This is the Sprint flavor, so you'll get dual band CDMA / EVDO (800/1,900MHz) with quad band GSM / GPRS / EDGE (850/900/1,800/1,900MHz), 2,100MHz UMTS support and 802.11b/g/n WiFi on 2.4GHz. That's all backed by the same 1.2GHz processor, 768MB of RAM and "Liquid Graphics" engine found in the other two RIM phones launching today, a tricky trio that have near-identical internals despite rather different externals. Of course, this phone bears more than a passing resemblance to the Torch 9810, but makes do without that one's keyboard. Instead you get a larger, 3.7-inch WVGA display, set beneath that silica waterfall, looking bright and contrasty and impressive, delivering the same edge-bending viewing angles we saw in the 9930. The screen is the strongest selling point of this phone, something that you'll have to like an awful, awful lot, because to get it you'll have to give up the slide-out keyboard on the other Torch, which is only slightly thicker (14.6mm, vs. 11.5 here) but suffers from a smaller, lower-res, 3.2-inch VGA LCD.. On the top of the right edge of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, along with a skinny, somewhat hard to press volume rocker rather lower on the chassis, about the same as on the previous Torch. New in the middle is a tiny little nub that can be used for muting. Lower still is the Convenience Key, which by default takes pictures, but offers a bit too much resistance to let you easily capture shots without blurring. The very top of the phone is the lock button -- taking up that entire side of the device. Squeeze anywhere here and the phone will lock or unlock itself. On one hand this is intuitive and comfortable, but we found this phone pocket-unlocking itself on more than one occasion thanks to that large, easy to depress sector. We don't need to tell you that pocket-unlocking is bad news. On the left is where the micro-USB port can be found, while the bottom reveals nothing much of interest. The termination of that waterfall, we suppose. In our testing we found call quality to be quite good on the 9850, whether talking directly into the handset or rather more indirectly to the room using the speakerphone. Indeed that speakerphone is plenty loud enough to fill up offices of nearly any size, to the point where if your office is too big to hear it you'd probably be in a position where you could simply hire someone else to attend that call for you. Camera Like the new Bold, the Torch 9850 packs a five-megapixel camera on the back, but unlike that one we have a proper autofocus lens here. This means you have the risk of capturing a genuinely out-of-focus image, but the camera does a far better job at grabbing macros than the EDoF lens on the 9930. You can see that in the close-up flower shots in the gallery below. Overall, we found images to look decent here, showing good color reproduction in general, but none succeeded in knocking our dress socks off. Video capture is at 720p and our footage looks reasonably good, with only a bit of focus-hunting on display. The only notable issue is some jiggle distortion that serves to make things a little livelier than they should. Finally, with no front-facing webcam, video chat is left completely out of the equation.. Gallery: BlackBerry Torch 9850 sample images | 20 Photos. Software We delved into BlackBerry OS 7 over in our 9930 review, so we'll refer you there if you're curious about what's new and how it helps out things here. Suffice it to say, though, that there isn't exactly a shocking amount of fresh meat in this bundle of software, and when it comes to the Torch 9850 there's one annoying issue: the lack of a proper home screen. Boot up the phone the first time and you're presented with a lot of display that can be filled with menus but nary a widget or shortcut. Basically, it serves only as a good place to show off your wallpaper. The BlackBerry integrated search function is a little less useful here than on the other handsets since you can't just start typing -- with only a virtual keyboard you have to first tap on the search icon. But, do tap on it and you'll find an excellent way to dig up any 'ol contact or favorite or document or whatever. Once tapped you can use the impressively accurate voice recognition or struggle with the virtual keyboard, a keyboard that is... It has a very similar layout to the on-screen keyboard found on the earlier Torch, but things are rather more square here. As virtual keyboards go it's fine, auto-suggesting as you type and of course using the same smarts that make physical BlackBerry keyboards so nice to use. (Hit space in an e-mail address to automatically add '@' or '.' in the appropriate places, for example.) But, the virtual keys are small and each time you try to find them you'll probably find yourself wishing you had a real keyboard, which you could have if you'd bought the 9810 instead. The phone comes pre-installed with a full version of Documents To Go, enabling the creation of Word-like, Excelesque and PowerPointish documents. The Torch of course also has full access to the contents of the App World. At this point there is indeed a solid selection of apps, but whether there are enough and, more importantly, the right kind is of course up to you. Finally, and most notably in this latest OS, is the new browser, which will do your HTML5 up right but turn its nose right up at Flash. Pages load snappily, scroll and zoom smoothly, and the phone scored a very healthy 2,668ms SunSpider score. That matches the score on the Bold 9930 -- unsurprising given they're running the same basic internals. Also unsurprising is that battery life here is not as good, managing six hours and 50 minutes on our intense rundown test. That's nearly an hour and a half short of the 9930 on Verizon, likely thanks in part to the larger display here. Regardless, that's much higher than your average Android smartphone and we think users will have no problem getting through a full business day -- even if your full business day is more five-to-nine than nine-to-five.. Gallery: BlackBerry Torch 9850 software | 16 Photos. Wrap-up We can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by the Torch 9850. It's reasonably slim, feels well made and, aesthetics-aside, is certainly not a bad handset. The thing is, it just isn't as good as t'other Torch that's also been released today, the 9810, because a 3mm gain in thickness gets you a full keyboard when you want it (and you will want it) plus a bit more internal storage. Sure, you lose out on screen size, but we never felt like there was all that much to do with the extra pixels here anyway. In truth, though, all three of the new phones are let down by their software. BB7 is a minor upgrade to BB6 and, when compared to the fluid, intuitive experience of the PlayBook and its QNX-based operating system, we find ourselves here mired in menus and EULAs. This leaves the whole OS feeling dated, tired, and ready to retire, and so if you were hoping for something truly new in your next BlackBerry, this isn't it. That said, if you're not quite ready to move on to a younger, fresher OS, if you're down with BlackBerry for the long-haul, you could do worse than the Torch 9850.

CNET también está disponible en español.. BlackBerry Torch 9850 (Verizon Wireless) review:. The Good The RIM BlackBerry Torch 9850 's svelte design and sharp screen give it consumer-level appeal. Features like 720p HD video capture, world phone capabilities, and an enhanced operating system are welcome. Call quality is good as well.. The Bad The Torch 9850 suffers from the occasional sluggishness, and there are times when the touch screen isn't as responsive as we would like.. The Bottom Line The RIM BlackBerry Torch 9850 for Verizon Wireless is a laudable midrange smartphone, but it faces stiff competition.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. RIM is once again making the rounds with its latest line of BlackBerry smartphones, with the Torch 9850 heading to Verizon Wireless after its initial launch with Sprint. The BlackBerry Torch 9850 marked a milestone for BlackBerry as the first-ever full touch-screen handset after the rather embarrassing mistakes of the Storm and the Storm 2. And we have to say, RIM made a decent effort here. The 3.7-inch display is sharp, and the 1.2GHz processor does a good job at improving overall performance. The Torch 9850 also ships with OS 7, which brings a number of under-the-hood enhancements like 720p HD video capture, voice-activated search, HTML 5 support, and more. The Torch 9850 is also a dual-mode CDMA/GSM phone, which makes it fit for globe-trotters.. As the Torch 9850 for Verizon Wireless has the same design and features as the one for Sprint, we'll focus more on slight software and performance differences that the Verizon version offers. For the full review of the device, please read our review of the BlackBerry Torch 9850 for Sprint .. One of the main differences between the Sprint and Verizon Wireless versions of the Torch 9850 is the bundled software. As you might expect, the Verizon version of the phone comes preinstalled with Verizon apps and services. They include VZ Navigator, Backup Assistant, V Cast Music, V Cast Videos, V Cast Song ID, VZWTones, and Bing search. Many of these can't be uninstalled. Aside from these apps, the rest of the phone's software is the same as the Torch 9850 for Sprint and other OS 7 handsets. For more on BlackBerry OS 7, please read our review of the BlackBerry Torch 9810 .. We tested the dual-band (CDMA 800/1900;UMTS 2100), internationally quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) BlackBerry Torch 9850 in San Francisco using Verizon's network. We enjoyed clear call quality on our end, though we did encounter a tiny bit of static occasionally. Otherwise, callers had plenty of volume and sounded quite natural.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Introduction: Can you believe that it has been almost three years since the original BlackBerry Storm 9530 debuted? And that it was positioned to being an iPhone killer at the time? Crazy to believe it, but yes, it has been that long. A year later, RIM was gracious enough to follow it up with its successor, the Storm2 9550 , which managed to iron out some of the kinks and issues with its predecessor – but still, it failed to be compete with its rivals. Interestingly enough, we thought that RIM’s desire to build an all touch smartphone died out last year when no successive device was announced, but it seems that RIM made use of the downtime. Well, after close to two years of dormancy, RIM is about to unleash their third take on the all touchscreen form factor with the BlackBerry Torch 9850. Not messing around with any gimmicks, it seems that the Torch 9850 might be the actual one to finally end RIM’s losing streak in achieving success in this category. Some might say that the third time is a charm, right? However, is it just too late for it to finally make some headway? The package contains: RIM BlackBerry Torch 9850 microUSB cable Wall Charger Hands-free 3.5mm headphones Design: Initially, we thought the Torch 9850 to be inferior in quality and craftsmanship compared to the. However, after getting a good feel for it, we’re accepting the totally new design approach that RIM is taking with the full touch BlackBerry. For starters, it’s a skinnier and more streamlined (0.45” thick) device, and at the same time, it’s by far the lightest (4.76 oz) out of the entire touch-only bunch. On top of that, we adore that the chrome trim sprinkles a bit of premium touch to a handset that’s constructed mostly out of glossy black plastic. Ultimately, it has an endearing design that’s able to drastically differentiate itself from RIM’s past offerings. You can compare the RIM BlackBerry Torch 9850 with many other phones using our Size Visualization Tool. Boasting the largest and highest resolution display to grace any BlackBerry smartphone thus far, we’re grateful to find a reasonable 3.7” WVGA (480 x 800) screen on the Torch 9850 – whereas the previous Storm units employed smaller 3.25” displays. Sharp is one way of calling it, but it’s nice to see plenty of distinctive details as well. Additionally, its high contrast allow colors to pop with enough iridescence to make our eyes drool. Granted that it’s not as alluring as Super AMOLED Plus displays, it’s nevertheless very attractive on the surface. As much as we’re inclined to interact with its touchscreen more, the handset still employs that typical optical trackpad as an alternative and useful way of navigating. Regretfully, we’re not digging the very narrow looking volume rocker and shutter key that are clinging to the right side of the phone – they simply lack any distinguishable outlines. the Torch 9850 is carrying a higher 5-megapixel auto-focus camera with a single LED flash. Removing the metallic back cover that’s covered in that soft touch matte material, we’re given access to its SIM card slot, microSD card slot, and 1,230 mAh battery.. This version of the phone is intended for Sprint, but an identical one, called Torch 9860, is for AT&T.. The RIM BlackBerry Torch 9850 is constructed mostly out of glossy black plastic.

RIM also wanted to keep the battery life higher so it omitted the extra core. Honestly it doesn't feel like it's dated or slow in the performance dept...it just needs some new shine on the OS..

C'mon dude.. posted on 20 Aug 2011, 01:10. Ugly design, but that's just my unimportant opinion. I LOVED Blackberry's torch 9810 design SOO much wow, but now they changed it to this basic-looking phone. 3.7 touchscreen is nothing to boast about even though it's BB's largest. Even the iphone 4 beats this. I hope their next design will improve. Their new bold 9900/9930's design is BEAUTIFUL though.. posted on 20 Aug 2011, 02:54. Uh...the iPhone does not beat the 3.7" touchscreen of the Torch 9850/9860. Also, this is an entirely different phone than the 9800/9810 Torch which is a smaller screen with a slide out keyboard. Personally, I like the look of this phone and will be getting it. I'm not too enamored with the physical buttons but it's not a deal breaker.. posted on 24 Aug 2011, 17:09. Sorry I meant that the iphone 4 design beated this, but yes you are right with the 3.5" display, but even the screen quality beats this. And I'm not a fan of the physical buttons either, but cool that you'll be getting it.. posted on 24 Aug 2011, 04:12. The Big question is....What to go for, the 9900 or the 9860. Had myn heart set on the Bold upgrade but am liking the look of the Torch upgrade. (Posts: 3; Member since: 25 Aug 2011). posted on 25 Aug 2011, 06:33. Each phone has its good bad and ugly. i do believe the new 9850 is a beautiful phone that will appeal to some and not others. as far as hardware and some of the people that complain about no dual core or wanting quad core get a life. if the phone functions well then its good. only reason you would need dual core is if you plan sitting and playing games all day instead of doing other things..

I love it, I love it, compare with a co worker Iphone and we both when on www.msnbc.com and my BB Torch loaded the site before the Iphone 4, we compare youtude videos and same. So yes the wait for this New BB Torch was worth it. posted on 08 Sep 2011, 10:38. I got the chance to play around with this phone yesterday and I have to admit that I am impressed. Blackberry has come a long way but still is behind on the hardware and most importantly the software. I love the design, not big and bulky and heavy like the storms yet its thin and light. The screen is amazing with the liquid graphics. The operating system is smooth, fast and the 1.2ghz processor seems to run it flawlessly. I like this phone primarily due to the fact that for me it is the perfect size phone. I have had many Android devices and felt that many of them were just too big to put in my pocket even without a case. I applaud Blackberry however I do not believe this will stop the impending buyout by microsoft. I predict a buyout of RIM by Microsoft. They will load WP7.5 on all new blackberries. Is it the perfect marriage? No, but its a start.. posted on 21 Sep 2011, 17:55. One thing to say for the RIM bashers... They have always made phones geared towards those who like to use their phone to take calls. More of a business phone than a toy. For those of you Android lovers ... you can bet the battery life will outlast ANY Android phone. Sure, great technology and OS, but what use is a dual core if the batt is always about die. Blackberry users don't need a fake drumset, or lighter app to look cool on your LED screen. Unlike your newest phone, Blackberry users like to keep their callers on the line. Its more like Android and iPhones are for the kids and teens, and Blackberry is reserved for the adults. By the way, before you retort, I am currently using a Blackberry Storm 2. I have not had the problems that many have reported. I still like it and it is running strong. I have not even used any of the newer BB phones yet and can only imagine how much better they can be. The 3.2mp camera I have still has better quality than the iPhone 4G. Goes to show that the tech specs may not be as "flashy new" as the competition, but the quality of the device does what it says it will do, and more..

Unfortunately due to corporate restrictions I can only use a Blackberry. I get them for free so I have had a chance to use almost all of Blackberry's models. My last was a Storm 2 which I absolutely hated. I just got a new 9850 and I have to admit it's by far and away the best Blackberry to date. I would say it's not up to par with other smartphones but for a blackberry it's a big step in the right direction.. (Posts: 1; Member since: 14 Nov 2011). posted on 14 Nov 2011, 17:01. Got 9850 a couple of weeks now. Light, feels sexy in my hand. perfect weight and size for a phone. why get an android phone...may as well get a table.The software, with all new touch UI is nice and familiar, but has some neat features that enhance the touch experience. swipe, touch and hold for menus, contextual Only complaints are, the portrait keypad is small, and back key could be moved a little further away from the \'L\' key so I don\'t keep pressing L when i want to back space. I can get around this by using the reduced keyboard which doubles up the Letters like on the Pearl and let the predictive text sort out my typing. The Horizontal keyboard however is perfect. the predictive typing and learning curve of the dictionary is next to amazing. This is everything that the first Storm should have been. For those BB users out there having doubts or clinging to your physical keypads. Don\'t worry, you wont miss it. I used a Palm and then BB for the past 12 years...and I don\'t miss the physical keypad for a second.. Want to comment? Please login or register .. Display 3.7 inches, 480 x 800 pixels (252 ppi) TFT.

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. BlackBerry Torch 9850 officially coming to Verizon September 8th for $200. Mobile Miscellany: week of August 22, 2011. BlackBerry Bold 9930, Torch 9850 go on sale at Sprint for $200, $150. RIM's BlackBerry Torch 9850 goes official for Sprint and US Cellular (update: Bold 9930 for Sprint, too!). What's a BlackBerry launch without a bit of love for RIM's CDMA partners? Infinite sadness, that's what. While the outfit (understandably) couldn't showcase the BlackBerry Torch 9850 at its London launch event this morning, the CDMA sibling to the Torch 9860 is making its official debut in the US of A. Destined for US Cellular and Sprint here in the States, the 9850 (shown right) will ship with a 3.7-inch WVGA (800 x 480) touchpanel, BlackBerry 7 OS, a "waterfall" screen design that tickles the edges ever-so-slightly, and not one inkling of a physical keyboard. As with the 9860 -- which is destined for AT&T, Rogers, Telus and Bell -- you'll get a five megapixel "zero-shutter lag" camera, 720p movie mode, inbuilt GPS and a 1.2GHz processor. There's no mention yet of a price or release for the SIM-less duo, but you can bet that we'll keep you posted as we hear more. Update : Sprint's just pushed out a full presser of its own (embedded after the break), which also confirms that the Bold 9930 -- shown above on the left -- will also be making its way onto The Now Network. We're told to expect "fall" availability for both BB 7 OS phones, but specific pricing isn't expected until that already-ambiguous time frame draws nearer. As for the 9930, it's boasting an all-too-familiar design, with a 10.5mm-thick chassis, 2.8-inch capacitive touchpanel, the "widest QWERTY keyboard available on a BlackBerry smartphone" and a trackpad to boot. Moreover, NFC support is thrown in, as is a magnetometer for AR apps. Update 2 : A trusted source just informed us that the Torch 9850 will soon go for $199 on contract (and after rebate) at US Cellular, or $549 with no strings attached.. America's First BlackBerry 7 Smartphones Coming to Sprint This Fall. BlackBerry Bold 9930 boasts thinnest design and widest QWERTY on a BlackBerry smartphone; BlackBerry Torch 9850 will be the first all-touch BlackBerry smartphone for Sprint customers. 3, 2010 – Sprint (NYSE: S) announced an expansion of its robust portfolio of BlackBerry® smartphones with the fall availability of America's first two BlackBerry® 7 smartphones – BlackBerry® Bold™ 9930 and BlackBerry® Torch™ 9850 from Research In Motion (RIM). Specific pricing and availability will be provided closer to availability. Both new smartphones are powered by the next-generation BlackBerry OS, BlackBerry 7, a performance-driven operating system designed to deliver the ultimate in communications, multimedia and productivity. Both smartphones also feature Liquid Graphics™ technology, a key new feature powered by BlackBerry 7 to deliver incredibly fast, smooth performance and a highly responsive touchscreen experience. They are also both powered by a 1.2GHz processor, offer 5MP cameras and are World Phone capable. "Sprint's incredibly loyal BlackBerry customers will appreciate the benefits of the BlackBerry 7 user experience on these two new smartphones – BlackBerry Bold 9930 and BlackBerry Torch 9850," said Fared Adib, vice president – Product Development, Sprint. "BlackBerry 7 is an evolution that extends the ability to support our customers domestically and internationally as they juggle their busy personal and professional lives with one easy-to-use device. We are excited to continue our strong relationship with RIM through these new powerful devices.". Two options – Super Thin or Full Touchscreen. At just 10.5mm thick, the BlackBerry Bold 9930 smartphone is the thinnest BlackBerry smartphone ever. It features a 2.8-inch capacitive touchscreen display, the widest QWERTY keyboard available on a BlackBerry smartphone and a trackpad for easy navigation. Key features of BlackBerry Bold 9930 include:. • BlackBerry® service with access to up to 10 supported business and personal email accounts, plus BlackBerry® Enterprise Server support for corporate email installations. • DataViz Docs To Go® Premium suite preloaded, for editing Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint files from anywhere. • BlackBerry App World™, the official app store for BlackBerry smartphones offering customization, fun and productivity. • BlackBerry® Playbook™ support with BlackBerry Bridge™ (Bridge is available as a free download on BlackBerry App World). • Near Field Communications (NFC) support for a secure exchange of information between NFC-enabled devices over a very short distance. • Augmented Reality using the built-in compass (magnetometer) to support augmented reality applications. The sleek BlackBerry Torch 9850 smartphone will be the first full-touch BlackBerry smartphone from Sprint. It features a spectacular, new 3.7-inch capacitive touchscreen display, the largest ever on a BlackBerry smartphone, and trackpad for easy navigation. Key features of BlackBerry Torch 9850 include:. • BlackBerry® service with access to up to 10 supported business and personal email accounts, plus BlackBerry® Enterprise Server support for corporate email installations. • DataViz Docs To Go® Premium suite preloaded, for editing Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint files from anywhere. • BlackBerry App World, the official app store for BlackBerry smartphones offering customization, fun and productivity. • BlackBerry® Playbook™ support with BlackBerry Bridge™ (Bridge is available as a free download on BlackBerry App World). • Augmented Reality using the built-in compass (magnetometer) to support augmented reality applications. Enhancing the Experience with BlackBerry 7. BlackBerry 7 introduces a next-generation BlackBerry browser with a significantly faster, more fluid web browsing experience that is up to 40 percent faster than BlackBerry® 6 based smartphones and up to 100 percent faster than BlackBerry® 5 based smartphones1. The new BlackBerry Bold 9930 and BlackBerry Torch 9850 smartphones also feature Liquid Graphics technology, with each smartphone combining a dedicated high-performance graphics processor with a blazingly fast CPU and stunning high-resolution display to deliver an incredibly fast, smooth and responsive visual experience. Building upon the Universal Search feature introduced in BlackBerry 6, BlackBerry 7 expands the capability to include voice-activated search. This new capability makes it easier and more convenient to search for content on the smartphone or web. BlackBerry 7 also integrates BlackBerry® Balance™, which separates personal content from corporate content, giving users the freedom and flexibility to use the smartphone for personal email, Facebook®, Twitter®, multimedia, games and other apps, while satisfying the need for corporate data to be highly secure and manageable. BlackBerry Balance works in conjunction with BlackBerry® Enterprise Server 5.0.3, which provides a number of unique IT policy controls, such as wiping only corporate data or blocking work-related content and apps from being copied or forwarded to personal contacts. BlackBerry Bold 9930 and BlackBerry Torch 9850 use the Sprint 3G Network domestically and offer World Phone capability for international travel to nearly anywhere in the world. Sprint customers have the power to make or receive phone calls in more than 185 countries and access to BlackBerry® data services, including email, apps and web browsing in nearly 150 countries. Customers also have the option of using a third-party SIM for international voice and data services.. 9850 , 9930 , blackberry , blackberry 7 os , blackberry bold , blackberry os 7 , blackberry torch , BlackBerry Torch 9850 , Blackberry7Os , BlackberryBold , BlackberryOs7 , BlackberryTorch , BlackberryTorch9850 , bold , Bold 9930 , Bold9930 , cdma , smartphone , sprint , torch , us celluar , USCC , UsCelluar.

The 9850 is decent enough if you require a full touchscreen display, but if you need a BlackBerry and are on Sprint, I’d recommend the Bold 9930 any day, hands-down.

Per the BlackBerry standard, it still has excellent email and communication capabilities, and some aspects of the new OS 7 interface are a step up from OS 6 and previous iterations. But I said this about the Bold 9930 and I'll say it about every other BlackBerry OS 7 device: you're better off waiting until RIM's QNX OS-based BlackBerrys hit the market. Then, I suspect, you'll be in for something new and different.. A lame and misguided attempt from RIM. If you’re a BlackBerry fan with Verizon who just has to have an all touch device, the $200 BlackBerry Torch 9850 is obviously your only choice but it’s a pretty terrible one.

It’s not a terrible phone, but it really is hard to recommend it over a device like the Samsung Conquer 4G, which has more to offer at a lower price. There are just too many blunders to overlook and I can’t see them improving via software updates. The Torch 9850 was a gallant effort, but in order to produce a full touchscreen device worth someone’s hard earned money, RIM seriously needs to go back to the drawing board.. The BlackBerry Torch 9850 is a bit of an anomaly, much like RIM's previous efforts at an all-touchscreen smartphone.

The BlackBerry Torch 9850 is a bit of an anomaly, much like RIM's previous efforts at an all-touchscreen smartphone. It won't appeal to the BlackBerry faithful, who likely demand a real, hardware QWERTY keyboard (and based on the virtual keyboard packaged with the 9850, rightfully so), and it isn't compelling enough to attract those who are in the market for a smartphone with a big touchscreen. Hampered by buggy software and a dated OS, not to mention looks only a mother could love, the Torch 9850 is just yet another disappointment from RIM. Its a shame, too, because with a different OS, or even just a better keyboard, the 9850 could appeal to those looking for a smaller phone that has a really great camera. When it comes to touchscreen slab smartphones, I would tell RIM to try again. But honestly, how many tries does it take for RIM to figure this out?. The Torch 9850 simply can’t compete with other smartphones in the market. The 9850 is decent enough if you require a full touchscreen display, but if you need a BlackBerry and are on Sprint, I’d recommend the Bold 9930 any day, hands-down.

The 9850 is decent enough if you require a full touchscreen display, but if you need a BlackBerry and are on Sprint, I’d recommend the Bold 9930 any day, hands-down. It has the best keyboard I’ve ever used and the design is much more beautiful. RIM created the Torch 9850 to go toe-to-toe with the dozens of full touchscreen smartphones on the market that run iOS, Windows Phone and Android. Unfortunately, because BlackBerry OS 7 is so far behind the pack, the Torch 9850 simply can’t compete.. It fills a glaring gap in RIM's device lineup. The BlackBerry Torch 9850 is a really solid smartphone. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it fills a glaring gap in RIM's device lineup. (It's a wholly different animal from the Storm/Storm 2 and much better than both of RIM's previous touch phones.) The 9850 is well-made, looks attractive, and all the aspects of the hardware function as they are meant to. Signal performance was a bit iffy, and that led to mixed results concerning call quality. Data speeds, however, were reasonably good. Battery life was decent for a touch phone, though some BlackBerry faithful may be shocked at the less-than-three-weeks of time between charges....

Data speeds, however, were reasonably good. Battery life was decent for a touch phone, though some BlackBerry faithful may be shocked at the less-than-three-weeks of time between charges. The messaging components are all locked into place and are as robust as any other BlackBerry; email, SMS, IM, Twitter, Facebook are all ably conquered. The media prowess of the 9850 is an improvement over other BB7 devices thanks to the larger screen and improved camera. The only real niggle I have with the 9850 is the crummy software keyboard. I found it to be unusable, and that could be a deal-breaker for those who have an addiction to messaging. In the end, however, there's little to complain about. RIM has done a good job at bringing BlackBerry 7 to life in a classy and capable smartphone. I can easily see the Torch warming the hearts of BlackBerry fans.. Reasonably slim and feels well made. We can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by the Torch 9850. It's reasonably slim, feels well made and, aesthetics-aside, is certainly not a bad handset.

We can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by the Torch 9850. It's reasonably slim, feels well made and, aesthetics-aside, is certainly not a bad handset. The thing is, it just isn't as good as t'other Torch that's also been released today, the 9810, because a 3mm gain in thickness gets you a full keyboard when you want it (and you will want it) plus a bit more internal storage. Sure, you lose out on screen size, but we never felt like there was all that much to do with the extra pixels here anyway.. With little in the way of must-have features, it’s tough to recommend the 9850 to those who would otherwise be considering an iPhone or Android device. RIM’s strength has always been in its text entry and messaging talents, but while the IM/BBM/email combo is present, the onscreen key... With little in the way of must-have features, it’s tough to recommend the 9850 to those who would otherwise be considering an iPhone or Android device.

Sony Xperia XZ2 embraces curves, haptics and 4K HDR. Galaxy S9 price details: Verizon, T-Mobile, unlocked, more [Updated]. Huawei MateBook X Pro hides pop-up webcam in svelte 3k laptop. How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. Vincent Nguyen - Aug 16, 2011. Mention all-touch and BlackBerry in the same sentence, and it’s tough not to experience an involuntary Storm-shudder. RIM’s belated answer to the iPhone failed to grab it the chunk of the touchscreen smartphone market it expected, and while the Storm 2 was an improvement, the company is yet to entirely convince when there’s no physical keyboard. Third time lucky, perhaps, with the BlackBerry Torch 9850, a compact BlackBerry 7 smartphone (aka the Torch 9860, the only difference being CDMA/GSM connectivity) hoping to convince us that QWERTY-free doesn’t mean zero appeal. Check out the SlashGear review after the cut.. Where both Storm handsets were chunky and masculine in their styling, the Torch 9850 flexes some curves. It’s a lightweight phone, at 4.76oz, and slim too, measuring in at 4.72 x 2.44 x 0.45 inches. A bulge on the back contains the 5-megapixel autofocus camera and LED flash, capable of 720p HD video recording, while the front is dominated by a 3.7-inch 800 x 480 display.. There’s no too-clever-for-its-own-good virtual clicking here, just a regular capacitive LCD TFT touchscreen that’s reasonably bright and responsive. Underneath are the usual send, end, menu and back buttons, flanking an optical trackpad which we found too low on the fascia to convince us to use it instead of the touchscreen. Keeping things running is the same 1.2GHz single-core processor as in the Torch 9810, again paired with 768MB of RAM. 4GB of integrated storage can be extended by up to 32GB with a microSD card.. Connectivity includes CDMA EVDO Rev.A along with quadband GSM and single-band 2100MHz UMTS/HSPA, making the Torch 9850 a so-called “world phone” capable of voice and data outside of North America. There’s also WiFi b/g/n, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR and microUSB 2.0, a headphone socket and GPS/AGPS, though no NFC as in the Bold 9900.. The downside to the light weight is somewhat plasticky construction, and the 9850 is a fingerprint magnet thanks to its glossy finish. The battery cover is matte, but the fake chrome trim and entire front soon get shiny with fingerprint grease.. The Torch 9850/9860 helps debut BlackBerry 7, RIM’s latest OS for smartphones. It’s not the QNX we’re waiting for – that won’t arrive on phones until 2012 – but it borrows some of the UI cues from the QNX-based PlayBook and the end result is a tighter user-experience than previous all-touch BlackBerries.. Performance is swift thanks to the 1.2GHz processor, only showing some lag when pinch-zooming in the WebKit-based browser. That’s a shame, as the WVGA display offers the best internet experience of the new BlackBerry trio. It may lack the resolution of, say, the iPhone 4, and the web performance overall can seem sluggish on heavier pages when compared to dual-core Android devices, but it no longer feels quite as much of a struggle as the Storm and Storm 2 did.. For a company known for its physical keyboard prowess, switching to a virtual ‘board obviously comes with a learning curve. Unfortunately, the on-screen layout still falls short of what we’ve seen on other all-touch devices: in portrait orientation, the key spacing is a little too close for decent accuracy, for instance, though landscape orientation is better. What RIM needs is a slick predictive system, like Swype, which could introduce some intelligence to counter the lack of physical keys.. Given the slim profile of the 9850, we were concerned the BlackBerry might fall short when it came to speaker or signal performance. Happily neither is the case, with the Torch clinging to a signal well and audio through both the earpiece and the speaker sounding good, if a little shallow when it comes to low-end audio.. Battery life from the 1,230 mAh user-replaceable li-ion pack in the 9850 is quoted at up to 6.8hrs of CDMA talktime or up to 13.4 days of CDMA standby. The 3G equivalents are slightly less. In practice, we managed more than a day of full use out of the Torch, though you could certainly prolong that for considerably longer by playing with the sync settings.. The Torch 9850 is a solid, capable little smartphone, and BlackBerry 7’s UI arguably suits the all-touch display most of all. With the 1.2GHz processor RIM’s handsets no longer feel like the slowest devices in the pack, and while we’d welcome more metal and less plastic in the construction, the styling is a reasonably successful compromise between classic RIM functionality and the curviness of a consumer device.. With little in the way of must-have features however, it’s tough to recommend the 9850 to those who would otherwise be considering an iPhone or Android device. RIM’s strength has always been in its text entry and messaging talents, but while the IM/BBM/email combo is present, the onscreen keyboard underwhelms. Third time’s the charm when it comes to RIM’s attempts at an all-touch device, but while the Torch 9850 is far better than the Storms that came before it, it still lacks the stand-out appeal that could break it out of the BlackBerry niche..

The BlackBerry Torch 9850 is a no-frills touch phone. There's no SurePress display, thankfully — just a regular capacitive screen.. HANDS ON PREVIEW: Every last detail leaked, but Samsung’s Galaxy S9 still blew me away. September 13th, 2011 at 11:35 AM. RIM didn’t envision creating a touch device. Yet here we are in 2011 with the company abandoning it’s prior failed attempts at making a touch-only smartphone, and instead copying the competition instead of innovating. The BlackBerry Torch 9850 is a no-frills touch phone. There’s no SurePress display, thankfully — just a regular capacitive. The device features a 1.2GHz CPU, a 5-megapixel camera, 4GB of built-in storage, and more. Does it stand a chance at competing with the iPhone and Android devices, though? Read on for my review.. The BlackBerry Torch 9850 features specs that mirror the fantastic BlackBerry Bold 9900 pretty closely — a 1.2GHz processor, 3.7-inch touch display, sporting a 800 x 480-pixel resolution, a 5-megapixel camera with auto-focus, 768MB of RAM and 4GB of built-in storage. It’s also pretty slim at 11.5-millimeters. The design of the Torch 9850 could have been incredible, but RIM counters most of its sleek styling with noise and distractions. For instance, the front of the device is this one big beautiful black slab that runs from the top of the smartphone all the way to the bottom. It’s like this sheet of touch sensitivity has been perfectly stretched over this awesomely-designed facade with. curves on both the top and bottom… but it gets. by these hideous hardware buttons that look completely out of place. To compound matters, the buttons don’t perform very well at all.. It was a last minute hardware change as the phone originally sported integrated BlackBerry keys much like all of RIM’s recent releases, and that would have been great if RIM was able to stick with that slick design.. The side and back of the device get worse and worse design and styling-wise. On the sides, RIM chose to use such a massive, gaudy, plastic chrome-look bezel, that the only physical buttons it could fit are these tiny, almost paper thin buttons that offer little tactile feedback. To make matters worse, RIM crammed not one or two, but three of these onto the right side of the phone — volume up, mute and volume down. Below those you’ll find a dual-stage dedicated camera button for the auto-focus camera. On the left side of the phone there’s a lone microUSB port.. Switching over to the back of the device, the industrial design that was too good to be true is again spoiled by poor color choices, worse material choices, and hardware placement. The battery cover cut out is reminiscent of previous BlackBerry Storm battery doors (anything having to do with the BlackBerry Storm should be wiped clean, and RIM shouldn’t sell that phone anymore) and it. the styling of what could have been a really smooth phone for the touch world. There are no charging contacts on the Torch 9850 so those awesome charging cradles won’t work, though RIM sells one you plug the phone into when it’s in landscape.. As far as touch goes on RIM’s first all-touch device (remember, I refuse to. the BlackBerry Storm since it has a SurelyPressed the wrong button screen), it’s pretty horrible. Let’s start with the physical screen itself.. First off, there’s no oleophobic coating on here, so grease and fingerprints get picked up very easily and it’s pretty difficult to wipe off. But worse than that is the material RIM used for the display; it feels completely different than the screen on the BlackBerry 9900. This screen feels like cheap plastic and it doesn’t allow your fingers to glide over its surface smoothly… at least not like other touch devices such as the iPhone 4 or Motorola DROID BIONIC, both of which use Gorilla Glass (Apple is rumored to). It’s another example of how RIM’s poor R&D management and foresight have affected not just the types of products it makes, but their quality as well.. I do like the integrated lock / unlock button on top of the device, though.. The good thing about this section is that the OS isn’t vastly different from previous BlackBerry operating systems. In fact, not much has changed at all in terms of significant user-facing elements. That means it’s a frustrating experience all around.. The Torch 9850 sports an outdated OS, the worst App ecosystem and selection, mind-numbing quirks and issues, all on a platform that was not ever made to be used on a touch screen.. Why is there a mouse cursor on an all-touch device in the web browser? It’s the. use an Exchange account without having a BlackBerry Enterprise Server? Why can’t I sync my Google account in addition to my Exchange account once I use a BlackBerry Enterprise Server? Here’s another example of something that irritates me: on smart smartphone platforms, when you’re erasing text, the speed at which your text will delete will start off slow and then speed up faster and faster since the system knows you’re erasing more than a few characters. This doesn’t happen on the BlackBerry Torch 9850, and it’s just one of a hundred little things that combine to form a user experience that really isn’t competitive at all.. This is an all-touch device, and as such, so a touch keyboard is your only method of inputting text. It better be damn good, right? Well, the keyboard on the BlackBerry Torch 9850 is probably the worst touch keyboard I think I have ever used. I actually think the keyboard on the Storm was better than this.. In portrait mode, forget about it. correction and suggestions, in addition to the look and feel off the keyboard, it’s just not a winner. “Haha” becomes “Bags”, “thats” doesn’t replace with “that’s”, and so on. And as far as the design, it makes no sense. On such a cramped layout, why would you waste space adding two shift keys — one on either side of the keyboard — just to do it? Why is there a dedicated comma key and period key?. The worst is part is that the keyboard only has two layout configurations that I have found; one for the standard layout, and one for the web browser.. As an example, typing in the “to:” field of an email is apparently the same as typing a message to a BlackBerry Messenger contact — the keyboard key placement doesn’t change as it would on other platforms to make commonly used keys more readily available in each scenario.. I like the phone app on the Torch 9850 a lot, especially when lightly customized. Having it open right to the dial-pad is fantastic, and I love the layout of the dial-pad, too. There are only three soft tabs here: the. I’m not going to dive deep into the phone app as it will upset me and ruin one of the only things I like about the BlackBerry 9850.. Battery life on the 9850 seemed quite good, though I didn’t talk much on the phone. Instead, I used it for emailing, BlackBerry Messenger, some web browsing and calendar functions. The phone easily could power through a day of this type of usage, and like most BlackBerry smartphones, the standby time is absolutely ridiculous.. Look, the tech-minded among us get caught up with raw specifications all the time, but the fact is, the experience is what sells to the general consumer and to most people. RIM doesn’t only miss the mark on both counts with the BlackBerry Torch 9850, the company demonstrates once again that it has no idea where the mark is or where it will be in the future.. It’s well chronicled how and why RIM has failed to stay. in the smartphone market, but what’s so shocking is that the BlackBerry Torch 9850 is basically little more than a Storm 9550 without the SurePress screen, which is nothing more than a lame, misguided attempt at trying to compete with Apple.. The reason I’m being so harsh, and the reason my views on the BlackBerry 9850 are so different than the BlackBerry Bold 9900 (which I loved), is because these are two different arenas. The Bold 9900 is what a BlackBerry is about. The Torch 9850 is a device RIM did not ever envision making, and it is manufactured to compete directly with the number one and number two touch smartphone platforms in the world. It feels like a feature phone compared to the BIONIC and iPhone.. If for some reason I was forced to either use RIM’s BlackBerry Torch 9850 or the first-generation iPhone as my daily phone, there’s no question what I would choose: the iPhone. Don’t forget that Apple’s first smartphone received iOS 2.0, one that brought the App Store, Microsoft Exchange support, and many more features that RIM still can’t compete with from several years ago.. If you’re a BlackBerry fan with Verizon who just has to have an all touch device, the $200 BlackBerry Torch 9850 is obviously your only choice but it’s a pretty terrible one. Do yourself a favor: duct tape your busted old Curve back together and hold out for the BlackBerry Colt .. Tags: BlackBerry , BlackBerry Torch 9850 , launch , release , review , RIM , Smartphone , specs , Torch 9850 , touchscreen. I used to sit around defending blackberry all day , get upset with articles like this. reading all these negative reviews on the og storm, I got it anyway , then turned around and got the storm 2. I realized , it was the same damn phone. Took that back and got the OG Droid.. I’ve had 5 blackberries , all of which I thought were the shit. The droid made me think , ” why was I so hung up on blackberry” since the droid ,. owned the droid incredible , thunderbolt , and droid charge .. All the things that I thought I would lose in blackberry was right there in android , but better. The whole push email thing was there ,. The threaded text blew that out of the water. calendars are much better , I can go all day with this .. The one thing that I can say was a little better was the battery life , I doubt there will. ever be a smart phone that beat rim at this .. a trade off i can deal with.. Ha, you bought a Storm and then a Storm2, LMAO. Geller, you haven’t even explored any of the software in your article. Such as the browser which i tested against the Iphone 4 and easily beats it. The added track pad made a world of a difference in browsing.. Love this phone! Coming from an iPhone 4, I have no problems!. Gotta tell you – he’s right.. I’ve been a lifelong BB user.. Rim’s latest offerings (save the new bold) just aren’t competitive.. I switched to a Samsung Galaxy S2.. I wanted to like the 9850.. I reaaally wanted to like it, but it just isn’t up to snuff.. It’s zero surprise why Rim is losing domestic market share (yeah, yeah, emerging markets, yeah.). Sure, I’m hoping that QNX will breathe some life into what little Rim stock I have left.. Man, it better be a home run.. If it’s not, Rim is in even deeper shit.. Having said all that, nobody does emails and messaging as well as Rim.. Wow is this an Apple site??? I am a BB-user and after testing the 9850 and the 9930 have to say, these are the best BB by far… Not sure why people are being so hard on RIM (as if their moms got caught playing with herself with a BB in her hand). Dude it is not that serious; buy the phone if you like it and don’t if you do not like it…simple has that. I am not a fan of the I-Maxi-Pads or their phones but I will not bash their hard work and tell someone don’t buy because it is rubbish. Let’s lay off RIM and use the KISS factor (Keep It Simple STUPID)…. As an enterprise user and locked into a Blackberry this phone Rocks compared to the 8330 that i was using until today. the only thing that it is truly missing is a front facing camera. I don’t understand why people are hating on it. The screen is bright the touch screen feels the same as an iphone (when a screen protector is used. I love the buttons and track pad that let you quickly edit and send documents. There is plenty of room on the 16gb sd card that comes with it for all of my work documents, i now feel like i have my office in the palm of my hand. I do wish that the app store was better but that is just the way that the cookie crumbles. All in all i think that it is a huge improvement from my last blackberry and is a solid phone.. Boy Gay Report you are about as smart as a door knob. To say BGR hate blackberries they sure do take the time to play with them…. Seriously when will BGR start adding a disclaimer to all their reviews that says:. “We here at BGR are dedicated Apple fanboys and Blackberry haters. We really don’t understand what Blackberry users like or want, we’re simply dedicated to pumping up Apple devices that have not shown serious innovation since the original iPhone.”. You guys really should get a grip…. This was a bullshit review i love blackberries but if your going to put a phone on verizon at least make it 4G LTE jesus. Love the unbiased (lol) review here from BGR. If you read this review, go try the device for yourself and ignore reviews from BGR. I love RIM and blackberry devices. Choose what you feel is best for what you need.. I am just reseaching the Torch 9850.. The review sounds like it was written by a disgruntled author.. I may be wrong but thats how it comes to me from the reading. For the record there is a cursor in the OS because the optical trackpad mimics as a mouse with the click functionality. Sheesh! Why do these people write reviews about devices they have hardly tested? It is not the most beautiful BB but untrue statements shall not be tolerated.. This guy is he freaking serios? This is a smartPHONE and you say you didn’t test talk-time, signal, call quality etc? Then you assert standby time is ridiculous. You moan that the phone section does everything in that tab without delving for. is like a Storm (running OS5). without surepress? Are you freaking serious? RIM is not doing well but this is about the most irresponsible regurgitation of stereotypical opinions from someone claiming to be a ‘techie’ as presented as a review I’ve ever seen. I had been warned about this site but nothing beats seeing for yourself.. there is just no way a bb could be as bad as this article posits… almost seems bought, they (other cell phone manufacturer) pay u to write this bro? seriously im all for a critique but at least be realistic! smh. The Torch 9810 is excellent, pretty harsh review but maybe this OS doesn’t work without a keyboard.. QNX phones are on the way thankfully.. 10 Netflix movies and shows you should watch before they’re removed in March. This discounted multi-use slow cooker is so good, it’ll make John Legere jealous.
