Average Score: 80.29% - good Average of. 70% Asus ZenFone 4 Selfie Review Source: NDTV Gadgets With the Asus ZenFone 4 Selfie, the Selfie series is accessible to a lot of people. Users get a decent front camera and live beautification mode can be useful if you are into vlogging or doing Facebook Live videos. For the price, the ZenFone 4 Selfie has decent hardware, but the performance of the rear camera is below average. If you intend to take a lot of selfies or use the live beautification mode, then the Zenfone 4 Selfie works as a good tool. If you don't mind spending more, the ZenFone 4 Selfie Dual Camera at Rs 14,999 has dual front cameras consisting of one 20-megapixel selfie shooter and another 8-megapixel one with a wide-angle lens. You also get more RAM and storage, though we haven't tested the phone out yet, so we can't speak for its real world performance. If you are on a strict budget and looking for an all-rounder, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Review) would be our pick.

Asus ZenFone 4 Selfie Dual Camera â Best Selfie Smartphone to own this festive season Source: Gadget Diary The ZenFone 4 Selfie (dual camera version) looks gorgeous, is easy to wield, and includes all the selfie hardware and software prowess an enthusiast could ask for. It beats contemporary selfie experts that are expensive and primarily competing in offline markets â both in terms of features and price. The bottom line is that if you are looking to buy or gift a selfie phone this festival season, the ZenFone 4 Selfie (dual camera version) feels like a great option.

ASUS Zenfone 4 Selfie Review Source: Yugatech If you can get past its lackluster design and dated display, you will find a device that performs decently and packs a punch with its selfie capabilities. With similar internals as the Zenfone 4 Max, weâd even go so far as to say that itâs a Zenfone 4 Max with less battery capacity and an improved front camera system. With an SRP of Php13,995, it doesnât break the bank, but the only way for you to justify purchasing it is if you want an ASUS device that can take great selfies â and in that regard, the Zenfone 4 Selfie is awesome.

Itâs a pretty good alternative to the slightly more expensive Selfie Pro, which is P5,000 more expensive. But if you can afford it a bit more and you want a phone that can deliver slightly better results, then go ahead and pick the latter.

ASUS ZenFone 4 Selfie Review: A New (Selfie) Challenger Appears Source: Unbox ASUS made a mistake by not continuing their original ZenFone Selfie when they launched it two years ago. That was an oversight on their part, just as the market for selfie phones exploded thanks to their rivals. ASUS has rectified that mistake, offering an extremely solid selfie offering at Php 13,995. The biggest challenge right now is trying to convince users to shy away from their competitors and see value in the products that theyâre offering.

Source: Unbox ASUS ZenUI is still on board, and while weâd still prefer a lighter UI overall this yearâs iteration is much better compared to the bloat-ware ridden mess last year. Thereâs only a few additional apps that are installed when we got the device, which makes for a more pleasant experience.

In the notebook sector, Asus had a global market share of about 11% from 2014-2016, making it the fourth largest laptop manufacturer.

If you are looking for a really good selfie phone with all the latest features Android 7.0 and 4GB RAM. It’s a really good mid-level smartphone with great processing and super amazing selfie camera.. Was this review helpful? 1 0. By Tirthesh Ganatra on November 2, 2017 | Verified Owner. Disclaimer: This is my secondary phone; my primary phone was OnePlus 3. Asus ZenPhone4 Selfie (dual camera version) is a phone which I can use it as a secondary device if I were using either iPhone or any other flagship device without dual-sim support. This is a phone which can be given to our parents who are not tech savvy and their usage is minimal (social media or consuming content). Selfie lovers will like this phone a lot, it has a dual front camera - which clicks good images compared to other phones I have used in this price range.. Phone is lightweight Good grip Camera is decent. Extremely slow charging (especially when it's below critical level). Slow finger-print reader (but accurate - very few times it failed to recognize my fingerprint). Was this review helpful? 1 0. Have you used this product?

Users get a decent front camera and live beautification mode can be useful if you are into vlogging or doing Facebook Live videos. For the price, the ZenFone 4 Selfie has decent hardware, but the performance of the rear camera is below average. If you intend to take a lot of selfies or use the live beautification mode, then the Zenfone 4 Selfie works as a good tool. If you don't mind spending more, the ZenFone 4 Selfie Dual Camera at Rs 14,999 has dual front cameras consisting of one 20-megapixel selfie shooter and another 8-megapixel one with a wide-angle lens. You also get more RAM and storage, though we haven't tested the phone out yet, so we can't speak for its real world performance. If you are on a strict budget and looking for an all-rounder, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Review) would be our pick.

ASUS Zenfone 4 Selfie Review Source: Yugatech EN→FR If you can get past its lackluster design and dated display, you will find a device that performs decently and packs a punch with its selfie capabilities. With similar internals as the Zenfone 4 Max, weâd even go so far as to say that itâs a Zenfone 4 Max with less battery capacity and an improved front camera system. With an SRP of Php13,995, it doesnât break the bank, but the only way for you to justify purchasing it is if you want an ASUS device that can take great selfies â and in that regard, the Zenfone 4 Selfie is awesome.

ASUS ZenFone 4 Selfie Review: A New (Selfie) Challenger Appears Source: Unbox EN→FR ASUS made a mistake by not continuing their original ZenFone Selfie when they launched it two years ago. That was an oversight on their part, just as the market for selfie phones exploded thanks to their rivals. ASUS has rectified that mistake, offering an extremely solid selfie offering at Php 13,995. The biggest challenge right now is trying to convince users to shy away from their competitors and see value in the products that theyâre offering.
