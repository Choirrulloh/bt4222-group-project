Thanks for the info bud and I tend to trade phones in to knock money off the ones I want and at the moment I have a u11 and g6 and I am also currently interested in the U11 plus or the Samsung s9 plus which be shown tomorrow but I admit I do love lg .... V30 + is also a great device but If you already have a U11 then don buy it. Main reason for that is the V30's display is not consistently great. I am fortunate enough to have a unit with great display without any display issues as mentioned by others.... How would you compare the U11 to the v30,would you say the v30 is better in anyway at all,?. I have a u11 myself but I am considering getting a v30 but I don't know if it would be worth it because the U11 is a excellent phone as it is..

CNET también está disponible en español.. HTC U11's gimmicky features distract from pure power. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good It’s a performance monster, it’s gorgeous front and back, it’s water-resistant, it’s big-screen. The HTC U11 ticks the boxes that matter.. The Bad The HTC U11’s squeezable sides feel more gimmicky than novel, as does HTC's virtual assistant. The stunning glass rear is prone to smudging, and the battery felt very thirsty.. The Bottom Line You won’t be picking this one up for squeezable sides. You’ll be picking up the HTC U11 for the performance and the design.. Feeling the squeeze Look, don't touch. It's getting harder and harder to make an impression when it feels like every major phone manufacturer is gunning for the super-powered, top-tier flagship title. The HTC U11 ( $629.00 at Amazon.com ) has tried to get you to sit up and take notice with features like squeezable sides that can launch an app and a virtual companion that promises to learn your preferences and make life easier. But the irony is that those bundled extras don't speak as loud as stunning design, a 2,560x1,440 resolution (QHD) screen to rival the Samsung Galaxy 8, quality of life perks like water resistance and an obscenely fast octa-core processor.. The trouble with the pressure-sensitive squeezable sides and the virtual assistant is that they feel like in-the-way gimmicks more than they feel like innovations. I relied more on Google Assistant than HTC's own Sense Companion, which offers up tailored recommendations for restaurants, smart alarms based on your calendar, reminders to charge (oh so important) and other tidbits. Much like the squeeze, it was fun to test out, but I found it getting in the way more than I found it handy to have around. With Amazon Alexa functionality also available now , it feels like HTC is banking on other virtual assistants too.. At $649, £649 or AU$999, it's also doing everything for less than the other usual suspects like the Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ) or the LG G6 ( $569.95 at Amazon.com ). Even with those extra features turned off, you can't ignore performance like this at that price. The U11 is a good phone and a worthy buy, but not because of its forgettable "perks".. This is going to be the biggest point of contention with the U11. It's been billed as a new way to interface with your phone: a one-handed, pressure-sensitive squeeze of the sides can activate the camera, launch apps, turn on the flashlight, whatever basic function you program it with. There's short and long holds, and it's contextual. By default, squeeze once to launch the camera, again to snap a quick pick with one hand. HTC Edge Sense, as it's called will also work underwater, where regular capacitive touchscreens falter. And in a water-resistant phone, it's easy to snap submerged selfies without workarounds.. Some people are going to love the novelty. I was not one of those people. In my first week with the U11, I squeezed it to launch the camera accidentally more times than on purpose. The squeeze provides haptic feedback, but the sides themselves don't actually move and it felt a little strange on the higher pressure settings. That, and the rudimentary programming available meant the Edge Sense didn't quite live up to the hype. I would have loved to set a short squeeze to skip songs on Spotify, for instance, but that level of specificity just isn't there yet. I didn't keep the HTC squeeze switched on for long.. The pearlescent "melted glass" rear of the phone is gorgeous right out of the box in every colour option (in red, black, blue, white and silver), but for me it was a total smudge magnet, which quite literally detracted from the lustre. Beneath a clear case the effect will be a little diminished, but you'll have a stunning, big-screen, smear-free phone for your troubles. Speaking of that screen, the glorious QHD, 5.5-inch display rivalled the best efforts I've seen from competitors. Sitting flush in a chassis with curved edges, the U11 looks great and feels great..

Business Insider Logo Logo for Business Insider over a transparent background. You have successfully emailed the post.. The latest HTC phone is gorgeous, powerful, and probably doomed. Jeff Dunn/Business Insider There was a time, not so long ago, when HTC was the gold standard for Android phones. At one point, around the release of the HTC One , it wasnât outrageous to say its design chops were superior to Apple and the iPhone.. Things have not gone well since.. The company has kept churning out mostly decent phones, but has fallen further into obscurity as Samsung furthered its control at the top, competition from China grew , and the space below the highest-end phones became a morass of manufacturers.. The HTC U11 , the companyâs new $650 flagship, probably won't reverse those fortunes. But if youâre just not diggingÂ. Samsung â or Apple for that matter â itâs well worth a look. From a distance, the HTC U11 is gorgeous. Itâs coated in super smooth glass, and the back sports one of a few solid, tremendously deep colors. My blue review unit here is something Iâd go out of my way to use â itâs clean, its shine immediately grabs the eye, and the way the light dances off the glass lets the phone almost change colors at different angles. When you rest it on a table, you want to put it face down.. The finish is like looking into a mirror. The U11 isnât the first phone with this look â I adored the similar finish of the Huawei Honor 8 last year â but pretty is pretty.. When you flip the phone over and look at its face, though, the U11 comes off as more dated. At a time where more and more phones are shrinking the borders around their displays, HTC still has giant black bars above and below its screen. Since it wants that screen to be big, the phone is taller than it has to be.. To be clear, having a bezel isnât some grave sin. Just because the tech world is moving this way doesnât mean HTC has failed. If the top and bottom bezels were nearly as thin as the ones on the sides, thereâd be no issue here. But because theyâre big enough to affect how you actually use the phone, theyâre a pain point.. Of course, The Great Bezel Debate wouldnât be as big a deal if phone makers would embrace small screens again , but it seems safe to say thatâs not happening anytime soon.. To HTCâs credit, the way the U11âs glass rolls into the aluminum sides is delightfully smooth, and the whole thing is neither thick nor heavy. The fingerprint scanner is fast, and everything is water-resistant. But, practically speaking, the glass is too slick for its own good. Put it on something that isnât perfectly flat and itâs bound to slide its way to the ground. It can be slippery to hold, too; this is very much not something to use with one hand. And because the back is all glass, itâs a massive fingerprint magnet.. I wouldn't trust it to be sturdy, either.. You can tidy most of this up by using a case, but then youâre neutering the big selling point of the design in the first place. As much as I love the look of the U11, I wouldnât be surprised if the annoyances that continuously arise with an all-glass design become overwhelming over time.. Once you turn on the U11, thereâs very little to complain about. That starts with the display: a 5.5-inch âSuper LCDâ panel with a 2560x1440 resolution. Text and images are plenty crisp. While it doesnât quite âpopâ the way the Galaxy S8âs OLED screen does, it still produces vivid, largely accurate colors. Its only real flaw is that it could stand to be brighter. It's a bit more difficult to read in the sun than it could be.. The pickiest phone fiends might also complain about LCD tech not having the level of contrast as the best OLED screens; black tones here arenât as deep or dark as they are elsewhere.. But smartphone screens are hard to get wrong at this point. Taken together, the U11 has the kind of display youâd expect from a $650 phone.. Likewise, the U11 is as fast and powerful as youâd like. Itâs got all the right specs: the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, 4 GB of RAM, and a plentiful 64 GB of storage. Apps load fast, nothingâs janky, and there isnât a game that doesnât run smoothly. It cruised through every benchmark test I threw at it. It can get a touch hot if you take a ton of photos over a prolonged period of time â being made of glass doesnât help â but itâs never egregious.. It also has a microSD card slot, if the included storage isnât enough for you.. With smartphones becoming increasingly commodified, itâs the little touches that stand out more and more. The U11âs quiet ace in the hole is audio: Listening to music with this thing is a treat. The pair of speakers on the phoneâs front and bottom are clear and loud (for a phone). I could play a podcast at max volume and hear it across my apartment without trouble.. That's not a big deal, but unlike the Galaxy S8, you won't have the ability to stream wireless audio to two speakers or headphones at once down the road.. Meanwhile, the âUSonicâ earbuds that come with the U11 may be the best pair of pack-in headphones Iâve tried. They connect over USB-C, and they put that digital connection to good use â thereâs a level of space, clarity, and bass response that just isnât there with pre-packaged earbuds. They also add a light noise-cancelling effect when the musicâs playing.. The hangup is that they only work with phones in HTC Uâs line. If you want to use your own pair of headphones, though, youâll have to pop in a dongle. Thatâs because HTC continues to omit the traditional headphone jack. The upside is that it does put a dongle in the box, and the DAC (digital-to-analog audio converter) in it is very solid â with a good pair of headphones, youâll get more detail here than you would plugging into most phones normally. As a result, the U11 is the first phone Iâve used that makes a legitimate case for the perks of USB-C audio. But all of that can be done without entirely removing the alternative. The dongle is still another thing to carry around.. Sadly, the U11 isnât as impressive when it comes to battery life. Inside its slim frame is a 3,000mAh battery. With that big, high-res display hogging up power, the U11 can just about last through a full day, but nothing more. If you push it a little, youâll probably have to charge by the late afternoon. It's not unmanageable to start, but batteries degrade over time, so donât be surprised if the situation gets worse a year in.. The good news is that the U11 supports Qualcommâs Quick Charge 3.0 standard, so it refills fairly quickly. Thereâs no wireless charging, but thatâs really not a big loss at this point.. The U11 runs on Android 7.1.1, under a custom skin HTC calls âSense.â That skin used to be loaded with superfluous changes, but today itâs far more restrained. It looks and feels similar to the clean, straightforward version of Android that Google produces itself. There are a few unnecessary apps pre-loaded by default â a couple of which cannot be uninstalled â but not so many as to be obnoxious. Youâll likely want to ditch the default keyboard and the âBlinkFeedâ news aggregator that sits next to the home screen, but doing so is easy enough. What is a problem, as it is with every Android manufacturer besides Google, is updates. HTC is better at getting new software features Â. out the door than most, but youâre still looking at a wait when Android O rolls out Â. Same goes for Googleâs monthly security patches; my test unit was a month behind on those out of the box.. On the plus side, HTC is promising to support the U11 through the next two major Android releases, so you shouldnât get too shafted on the software side.. The headline addition here is something HTC calls âEdge Sense.â This lets you literally squeeze the bottom sides of the phone to quickly launch any app, including Google Assistant (Googleâs Siri competitor). You can set it to control two actions at once â a short press could launch, say, the camera, while a long press could turn on the flashlight.. When you squeeze to activate Edge Sense, these little icons will pop up on the sides. This is gimmicky, yes, but it works. Simply squeezing the phone to take a photo is both faster and more natural-feeling than unlocking, swiping, and tapping your way to an app.. I could see many people simply ignoring it, and you can turn it off if needed, but it has no harm in being there. The other big addition isnât ready yet: Alexa integration. Later this summer, the U11 is set to become the first smartphone that can call on Amazonâs virtual assistant just by calling its name, much like you would with an Echo speaker. (Huaweiâs Mate 9 supports Alexa today, but only through a standalone app.) This will be completely ignorable if youâd like, but if youâve got your data with Amazon already, it should be nifty.. If two wasnât enough, the U11 also comes with HTCâs virtual assistant, called Sense Companion. Itâs not like Google or Alexa, though â instead of asking it general questions, the idea is for it to read your data, then pop in onscreen with suggestions where appropriate. If youâre out on the town, for instance, it might suggest a restaurant to visit.. It didnât do much in my week and a half of testing, though. It sometimes suggested I clear out some background processes using HTCâs Boost+ app to save power, but beyond that, itâs hard for me to say itâs useful enough to justify letting HTC read everything I do on my phone.. The U11âs camera is ready to go, though, and itâs excellent. To get it out of the way: No, I donât think itâs better than the Galaxy S8 or Google Pixel, the two leading cameras on the market. During the day, the 12-megapixel shooter here gets truly fantastic detail, with little noise. Colors hit that sweet spot where theyâre accurate, but boosted enough to not be dull. The whole thing is fast to focus, too.. Here are a few more sample shots.. Note that some detail is inevitably lost when we resize and upload images for an article like this. On the phone itself, things are a bit sharper and more vibrant. The camera has its faults, though. While the U11 does well to not wash out shots most of the time, it can skew a bit too dark for my liking by default. Itâs generally slower to actually take a photo than the Galaxy S8 or Pixel, particularly in the dark. And in those darker settings, where so many of these things go wrong, itâs not bad, but not immune from sloppiness either. Still, I can't see many people being disappointed with the whole package.. Here's a sample shot in mostly low lighting.. This is one of the better examples; sometimes, the U11 can be much slower to shoot and introduce more noise when taking photos in the dark. The 16-megapixel selfie camera, meanwhile, is solid. It's much more prone to noise than the main shooter, but it does the job in the right light.Â. Also of note is that the U11 will only be sold through Sprint in the US. That, again, wonât do HTC any favors when it comes to boosting sales â Sprint is a distant fourth in terms of subscribers. Unless you already have a deal with Sprint, you should probably buy the unlocked model: That costs $50 less than the Sprint version, and it'll work on any of the big four carriers.. The HTC U11 is a perfectly fine flagship â it looks good, runs fast, takes great photos, and has several nice little touches. Itâs got a faster processor than the LG G6 and Google Pixel, and it costs less than the Galaxy S8. If you just want something different than an iPhone or Galaxy phone, its striking design and audio tricks put it near the top of that âeverything elseâ category, somewhere alongside the G6 and Huawei's Mate 9. But the ergonomics are a bit off, the lack of a headphone jack is still pointless, and the battery is underwhelming. Those arenât fatal flaws, but it makes the U11 more of a hard-hit double at a time where HTC could really use a home run. Buy the U11 if you love this look and are a borderline audiophile; otherwise, there's little that demands you grab it over the Galaxy S8..

HTC U11 and U11+: Everything you need to know!. The HTC U11 and U11+ represent a new direction for the Taiwanese company, featuring an all-glass build, great camera and squeeze input.. HTC has, to put it lightly, seen better days. In 2017, the company is trying an all-new design language to entice customers. Gone are the solid metal builds from the HTC One lineup , replaced by slick, reflective glass. On the inside, the HTC U11 and U11+ feature standard flagship components for 2017, and the company can finally stand toe-to-toe with competitors' cameras.. Here's everything you need to know about the HTC U11 and U11+.. The U11 was released in spring of 2017, with the U11+ coming out in the fall. Both are similar enough on the inside, with the U11+ featuring a more modern, small-bezel design. Be sure to check out our review of the U11 and hands-on preview of the U11+.. More: HTC U11 review: Back in the running. More: HTC U11+ review: The best phone you can't buy. Phones need something inside to make them go beep, and the U11 and U11+ both feature the best internals for 2017:.

Ice white, brilliant black, sapphire blue, solar red, amazing silver. The U11+ has a sweet translucent variant. The squeeze feature is surprisingly useful. HTC isn't one to shy away from exotic colors on its smartphones. The U11 has a fiery red version and I always wanted to pick up the awesome blue HTC One M7. For the U11+, HTC went in a slightly different direction. There's the standard glossy black variant, but also a really intriguing translucent variant. It isn't completely clear, but you'd be able to pick out the NFC antenna and other components on board.. More: HTC U11+ hands-on preview: More screen, more battery, translucent body. The U11+ is kinda, sorta related to the Pixel XL 2. While squeezing the side of your phone may sound gimmicky, it's actually quite practical. Users can map a short or long squeeze to two separate actions, including custom actions within applications. For example, you can set a short squeeze within Google Maps to zoom in on the map, while a long squeeze could start navigation home. Squeezes can also be used for system functions like launching the camera app, toggling the flashlight or taking a screenshot.. More: The HTC U11 is the most solid phone of 2017 so far. Smartphones take about 18 months to develop from start to finish, and along the way, things can get complicated due to supply constraints or a different focus within the company. There were rumors earlier this year that we'd see three Pixel phones: what we now know as the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL , and a third device slotted somewhere in the middle. That rumored device had a lot of similarities to the Pixel 2 XL, with a 6-inch 18:9 screen, a rear fingerprint sensor, and the same general proportions. But some of that is table stakes: the Pixel 2 line and the U11+ use similar internal components because they're using the standard 2017 flagship parts. It's fun to think about, but it's unlikely the U11+ was meant to wear the Google badge.. More: HTC U11+ started life as a Google Pixel 2 XL project — but the story isn't that simple. The U11+ launched with Android 8.0 Oreo , making it one of the first non-Google phones to run that version of Android. This also means Project Treble is supported , hopefully adding to the longevity of software support for this phone. Meanwhile, the standard U11 launched with Android 7.1.1 Nougat , with Oreo rolling out to the unlocked version of the phone. The carrier variants should receieve the update shortly.. More: Android 8.0 Oreo for unlocked HTC U11 now available. Be sure to check out our forums!. The unlocked HTC U11 is priced at $649, putting it in the same league as the Moto Z2 Force , Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6. Among these devices, the U11 stands well: the camera is solid, second only to the Google Pixel line. The U11 has a very striking design, though it is a bit dated with its capacitve navigation buttons and front facing fingrerprint sensor. The U11 finally added IP67 water resistance, and the squeeze feature is suprisingly effective in everyday use. Where the U11 falls apart is general availability: most carriers aren't stocking the phone, meaning you won't be able to try one in store before buying it.. The U11+ corrects the design flaw, but compounds on the availability issue. The U11 Plus's design catches up in a big way with other 2017 flagships, moving the fingerprint sensor to the back, moving to software navigation keys and including an 18:9 (or 2:1 for those that like math) display. But HTC isn't selling the U11+ anywhere in the United States, meaning those that aren't HTC faithful probably aren't going to even know the device exists in the states.. HTC U11: With so much in common, it's a tight race. Want to know more about the U11 and U11+? The Android Central forums are a treasure trove of information, so be sure to stop by there and ask any remaining questions you have!. More: HTC U11 on Android Central forums.

Buy Now: HTC U11 on Vodafone (32GB) £45/month, free upfront. When the HTC U11 first came out, I thought it was a great phone that not many people would buy.. The U11 has a top-notch camera, super-fast Snapdragon 835 CPU and wonderfully sharp quad-HD screen. But its slightly atypical shiny design, lack of a headphone jack and wealth of superfluous features left me concerned there wasn’t enough to entice buyers away from the stellar Galaxy S8 , or cheaper OnePlus 5 .. Related: When will my phone get Android Oreo?. After three months with the phone, though, I can’t help but hope I was wrong. With long-term use the U11 has proven itself to be one of the best handsets I’ve tested this year, and has had a number of welcome upgrades that will delight tech fans.. At a basic level this is because the phone’s continued to get all the basics right. Unlike the Huawei P10 I was previously using, the U11’s battery hasn’t deteriorated at all and still offers me the same day and a half of regular use that it did straight out of the box. Performance is also as nippy as ever – a fact likely aided by the U11’s lack of bloatware.. Related: Best HTC U11 deals. The U11’s software has actually improved since launch thanks to the addition of Amazon Alexa support. I’m not convinced Alexa is any smarter than Android’s built-in Google Assistant, but the addition is a welcome one that made it easy for me to shop on Amazon without having to launch the app and manually search for items.. The feature also showcases one of the U11’s best, but most overlooked, selling points: its microphones. The U11 has some of the best mics I’ve used on a phone, and they mean that Alexa is worryingly good at picking up voice commands – a fact showcased when I nearly made an accidental and costly Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti purchase when I inadvertently answered “yes” to a visiting friend’s question while running a price check with Alexa.. Alexa also made me finally properly take advantage of the U11’s previously bizarre “Edge Sense” squeeze controls. I currently have the phone set so a short squeeze will launch Alexa while a long one will kickstart Google Assistant.. That’s not to say everything has been kittens and rainbows during my time with the U11. The lack of a headphone jack is still an annoyance that’s kept me from using my favoured Fender FXA2 wired headphones, as the bundled USB-C adapter is insanely flimsy and easy to break. I’m already on adapter number three after the connecter bent in my pocket on the walk to work.. The adapter is also fairly finicky to replace, as the U11 only accepts the official one being sold on HTC’s online store. Be warned, close to all of the third-party USB-C adapters on Amazon will not work with the U11.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Still, this is a small annoyance considering the HTC U11’s other perks, and one that can easily be avoided with the use of wireless headphones (if you can put up with the audio quality downgrade that is). The other option is to use a proper USB headphone amp. but that’s an expensive option that’s only worthwhile if you’ve spent a decent amount on your cans.. The U11 is HTC’s answer to Samsung’s seemingly unconquerable Galaxy S8 , which is TrustedReviews ’ current smartphone of choice. In its bid to outdo the Galaxy, HTC has loaded the U11 with an arsenal of interesting features.. Highlights include Amazon Alexa support, Hi-Res Audio capabilities and a slightly bizarre set of “Edge Sense” squeeze controls – yes, you read that right. These, plus a wealth of cutting-edge components, make the phone a great choice for any smartphone buyer willing to put up with its atypical, super-shiny looks.. The U11 follows the same ‘Liquid Surface’ design as HTC’s previous U Play and U Ultra handsets. This replaces the unibody metal design for which HTC was previously known with a new combination of metal and glass.. Personally, I wish that HTC had stuck with metal, but from a distance I’ll concede that the design looks great. This is largely because HTC has managed to pull a canny trick, where the colour of the glass changes depending on teh angle from which you view it. For example, the silver version I tested switches between hues of silver and blue, while the black takes on a greenish tint at certain angles.. However, upon closer inspection of the device you’ll realise there are a few problems with the U11’s design. Unlike the Galaxy S8, which also features a mixed-material casing, the glass on the U11’s back is bolted onto – rather than housed within – the metal frame. This small difference makes the phone feel far more chunky, measuring in at. 7.9mm thick – and, in my mind, slightly less luxurious.. This feeling isn’t helped by the fact that the back is an outright fingerprint magnet. Within 10 seconds of it leaving the box, the rear was a criss-cross of marks and smudges.. The only other slight quibble I have with the design is that, by today’s standards, the bezel is fairly chunky. A few years ago this may have been fine, but in comparison to other 2017 flagships – such as the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 – the giant black edge around the U11’s screen looks a little retro, and not in a good way.. Like past U-series phones, the U11 doesn’t have a headphone jack. I understand the argument that USB-C is the future, and HTC has managed to curtail the issues associated with not having a 3.5mm jack socket by including an adapter and a surprisingly good pair of in-ear USB-C “USonic” headphones. Nevertheless, the socket’s absence is still an annoyance. Over the two weeks I’ve been using this phone, I’ve repeatedly been forced to forego the listening pleasure of my Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 and use the USonic – or my wireless Jaybird Freedom gym headphones – on my commute because I’ve forgotten to pack the adapter. Case in point: there isn’t a photo of the adapter in this review because I can’t for the life of me remember where I put it.. Outside of this, however, the design ticks most of the right boxes. The fingerprint scanner sits in the U11’s front home button and, while not quite as nippy as the Huawei P10 or P10 Plus’, it’s been consistently reliable when unlocking the phone.. The appearance of a microSD card slot is also welcome, although I can’t see anyone but power users needing it since the U11 already features either 64GB (tested) or 128GB of internal storage.. The fact that the U11 has been designed to meet IP67 certification standards will be a boon for accident-prone users, and means the phone will be able to survive accidental submersions in liquid at depths of 1m and below for 30 minutes.. Outside of its slightly chunky bezel, the U11’s screen is top-notch. The 5.5-inch panel’s quad-HD (2560 x 1440 pixels) resolution ensures text and icons are uniformly sharp; you’ll struggle to spot any individual pixels.. The Super LCD 5 panel also offers decent colour temperature, with none of the RGB spectrum looking too cool or too warm – although they don’t look quite as vibrant as competing phones with AMOLED panels.. I didn’t notice any serious backlight bleed on the U11 during my first week of use, either. My only slight issue is that the maximum brightness isn’t quite as high as that of the Galaxy S8. This isn’t a huge disaster, as 99% of the time you won’t want the display maxed out. It only becomes an annoyance when using the U11 outdoors in direct sunlight, or very bright indoor areas, where the screen can become fairly reflective. Being fair to HTC, though, this is an issue I experience with the majority of phones I review.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

HTC has had a rough go of it in the extremely competitive flagship space, and the company needs a hit on their hands to make a comeback. Now, with its latest high-end offering, HTC has gone a completely different route from what we saw with the 2016 flagship, the HTC 10 .. With top-of-the-line specs, a smooth and snappy software experience, and a squeezable chassis, does the U11 differentiate itself enough from the competition? Is it worth the money that you’ll have to squeeze out of your wallet? Find out in our full HTC U11 review!. HTC has always had a penchant for beautifulÂ. design and solid build quality, so it’s no surprise to see the U11 excels in this area. Instead of a metal construction like it normally employs on its high-end offerings, HTC has opted for metal and glass with the U11. The device features rounded corners, curved edges on the front and back, and an aluminium frame sandwiched betweenÂ. This all makes for a seamless, comfortable in-hand feel.. This design is bound to turn heads. is something we’ve seen numerous times now, but what makes the U11 stand out is the liquid glass surface on the back. This design is bound to turn heads, and the way to color shiftsÂ. and changes depending on the angle results inÂ. Even though it's beautiful, the U11 is a slippery fingerprint magnet. Because this is a rounded, glass phone, it’s also quite slippery. HTC thankfully includes a clear plastic case in the box though, so perhaps this isn’t the biggest issue for folks who like to protect their devices. One other thing that case is good for: protecting against fingerprints. The U11 is an absolute fingerprint magnet, so keep that in mind if you’re worried about your phone looking smudgy.. While most other companies are going for taller and narrower display in 2017 (Samsung, LG, and Essential, just to name a few), HTC has gone with a more traditional, familiar display on the U11. The device comes with a 5.5-inch Quad HD Super LCD 5 display, with a “normal” 16:9 aspect ratio.. Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus review: Almost to Infinity. With the Samsung Galaxy S9 just around the corner, we thought this would be a fun time to take a look back at our review for the current S8 family. LG G6 review: it flies… like a G6!. Last year saw LG bring us the LG G5, a handset that dared to be different and failed spectacularly in doing so. This resulted in losses for the companyâs mobile division in 2015, and lost â¦. The front of the U11 just seems dated compared to the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. The bezels around the display are pretty thick. Although it doesn’t affect how you’ll use the phone, the front of the U11 just seems sort of dated compared to the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 .. The quality of the screen itself is fantastic. It’s sharp, crisp, has excellent viewing angles, and vibrant colors. Outdoor visibility isn’t an issue, though IÂ. do wish the display was able to get much dimmer. It feels a bit too bright when using it at night or in the dark, but that’s only a minor complaint for what’s otherwise a great display experience.. In terms of specifications and hardware, the U11 ticks all the right boxes. Under the hood is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor backed by 4 GB of RAM, and overallÂ. performance is just as fast and fluid as you would expect.. The U11 provides Pixel-like levels of performance. Touch response and scrolling is excellent and it runs apps and high-end games with no issues at all. Multi-tasking is also nice and quick, but I did notice that the RAM management is quite aggressive with the device sometimes closing apps after opening only five or six of them. While that isn’t a big deal for me,Â. The U11 in the United States comes with 64 GB of on-board storage, which you can expand up to an additional 256 GB via microSD. There’s also a global variant of the device that comes with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. That’s great news for folks outside the U.S., though we wish the higher-end model was available for everyone.. The U11 features the same woofer and tweeter combo that we first saw with the HTC 10 , but it has been improved significantly this time around. It is much louder and with better clarity, and HTC is leveraging the entire phone as an acoustic chamber to make this happen. You can literally feel the audio resonate through the device when holding it in your hand, and there is a huge difference in audio quality and volume when listening to the U11 and HTC 10 side by side.. The U11 doesn't come with a headphone jack, but it's forgivable because of how good the audio sounds through the USB Type-C port. The U11 doesn’t come with a headphone jack, but I think it’s completely forgivable because of how good the audio sounds through the USB Type-C port. The USonic earbuds that are included in the box are some of the best sounding pair of earphones I’ve ever listened to. They’re able to analyze and tune the audio specifically for your ear structure and also feature active noise cancellation.. If you don’t want to give up your current pair of headphones, HTC also includes a 3.5 mm to USB Type-C adapter in the box. Using the adapter will give you a much better audio experience, as it actually sport a built-in DAC. This allows you to drive higher impedance headphones.. HTC has finally (finally!) caught up to the rest of the pack on the water resistance front. HTC has finally ( finally! ) caught up to the rest of the pack on the water resistance front. The U11 sports an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, meaning it can survive after being submerged in water. This is a huge step up from the IP53 rating of its predecessor. With most current generation flagships featuring similar protection from the elements, this was definitely a smart moveÂ. On the front below the display, you’ll find the standard array of capacitive keys HTC usually includes on its smartphones. The back button and recent apps keys flank the home button, which also doubles as a fingerprint sensor. The fingerprint sensor, as is the case with most other HTC phones, is speedy and reliable.. The U11 does a lot of things well, but none of that matters if the phone can’t last all day. Thankfully, battery life with the device is extremely good despite featuring a 3,000 mAh battery, which is a fairly average capacity by current standards. The phone never struggled to make it through a full day of use even with heavy usage, and I never had to reach for the charger in the middle of the day.. I never had to reach for the charger in the middle of the day. When you do have to charge the phone, it gets back to a full charge pretty quickly thanks to Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0. It’s pretty impressive that HTC was able to extend the U11’s battery life without the need to include a larger battery this time around.. one of the biggest topics of discussion was the device’s camera. The company was eager to tell us that the U11 has the highest DxOMark score of all time , outranking the Pixel and Galaxy S8 by one and two points, respectively.. Overall, the U11's camera lives up to the hype. The U11’s main camera comes with a 12 MP “UltraPixel 3” sensor, with an f/1.7 aperture and optical image stabilization. Overall, the U11’s camera lives up to the hype and is capable of taking some impressive photos. There’s plenty of detail in each shot, and color reproduction is natural and not overly vibrant.. Photos taken in low-light conditions are incredibly sharp and well detailed, too. Noise levels are kept under control, and the noise you do see is very fine and compact. Low light photos aren’t splotchy at all, which isÂ. something we don’t see too often in smartphone cameras.. Although this is a new sensor, it does suffer from one issue in low-light situations that we also saw with the U Ultra. Highlights are very heavily overblown and snapping photos that have light sources causes a lot of streaking, lens flares, and floating light particles. This was also a pretty big problem with the U Ultra, which is whyÂ. I believe this might be caused by the phone’s reflective back. If that is the case, there isn’t really a permanent fix for it, other than using a case. Still, it’s not an issue many people will find to be bothersome.. The front-facing camera no longer comes with OIS like the HTC 10 did, but you are getting a much higher resolution 16 MP unit for capturing better and sharper looking selfies. Both the rear and front cameras are also leveraging a new feature dubbed HDR Boost, which auto-processes as HDR to give you the clearest and most well-balanced photo possible, similar to what Google has done with the Pixel .. Not a lot has changed on the software front compared to the U Ultra or even the HTC 10 before it. The U11 is running Android 7.1.1 Nougat with HTC’s Sense on top, and with that comes all the familiar features HTC normally includes in its phones: BlinkFeed, a vertical scrolling app drawer, and a theme store.. Read more: Android 7.1.2 Nougat review. Sense is still one of the cleanest takes on Android, but it is starting to feel a little dated and in need of a refresh. The U11 was a perfect opportunity for HTC to do that, but unfortunately that didn’t happen. I do appreciate that the U11 doesn’t come with a lot of pre-installed bloatware, though. Sprint version there are only a couple pre-installed Sprint apps. If you do want the least amount of bloat, you should probably check out the unlocked version.. standout feature on the U11 is the new Edge Sense technology, which is HTC’s new shortcut for accessing different apps or functions on your phone. You can make it do anything from opening up the camera, to launching Google Assistant, to turning on the phone’s flashlight. While some companies like to add an extra to button to the side of their phones for added functionality, HTC has decided to make the U11Â. It does sound like a weird thing to do, but it is surprisingly intuitive and works extremely well.. We’ve talked a lot about the Edge Sense feature in the past , and what you need to know about it is this:Â. it’s weird, fantastic, and is certainly one of the most interesting ways weâve been able to interact with phones in a long time.. The U11 will come with HTC's Sense Companion, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa on board. AI assistants are a big part of smartphones right now. The iPhone has Siri, Samsung phones have will have Bixby , and Google and Amazon have been bringing the Google Assistant and Alexa to many different Android phones. Not only does the U11 come with Google’s Assistant on board, it also sports HTC’s new Sense Companion that first launched on the U Ultra. will give you suggestions based on your location andÂ. the time of day, and will learn your usage habits over time and provide information that it thinks you may want to know.. For example, it can randomly update you with the weather information for the day, provide restaurant recommendations when it is time for lunch or dinner, remind you to charge your phone, or give you traffic updates based on your commute. All of this is shown in a card style layout, which may sound familiar since Google already does this. However, it does work fairly well if you choose to use it, but the big difference is that there is no voice component to the Sense Companion. This means you’ll have to use the Google Assistant for voice dictation.. If two AI assistants weren’t enough, the U11 will also support Amazon Alexa, with the update to activate this feature expected to roll out in July. When that update comes, you will certainly not be lacking in choice when it comes to which AI assistant you want to use.. If you want to buy the HTC U11, you have a few options. HTC is selling it through its website for $649 , andÂ. you can also buy it on Amazon for that same price. If you need a carrier partner, Sprint is the only U.S. carrier that will carry it in-store and online.. At $649, the U11 is certainly more reasonable than the U Ultra ( $749 ) and the Galaxy S8 ( $725 ). It isn’t an overpriced phone by any means, but it certainly falls outside of impulse buy territory.. HTC has also put itself at a huge disadvantage by not having this phone available throughÂ. The U11 is trying to compete with the Galaxy S8 and G6, after all, and unfortunately consumers aren’t going to see the new HTC phone on display when they walk into their T-Mobile, Verizon, or AT&T store.. The HTC U11 isn't a phone that should be overlooked by any means. The HTC U11 isn’t a phone that should be overlooked by any means. With its fantastic build quality, top-of-the-line specs, and stellar camera, this device will tick all the right boxes for most users. The overall experience is rounded out with a rich audio experience and unique Edge Sense feature, making HTC’s latest flagship a truly compelling package.. Your source for all things Android!.

HTC U11+ review: The best phone you can't buy. HTC rounds off a turbulent year with an excellent Oreo-powered phablet. HTC's new 6-inch phone takes everything we loved about the U11 and augments it with a more up-to-date design, the latest Android software, and a huge battery.. Dependable battery life, even with heavy use. Display lacks the brightness and punch of competitors. Design not as svelte as rivals. It's become something of a sad cliche to preface an HTC review with a refresher of the company's current monetary woes, contrasting what have generally been quality products with what has generally been a grim financial performance. Sure, HTC as a company has indeed seen better days, but it still knows how to make great Android phones, as evidenced by the quality of devices like the U11 .. Now, as the year draws to a close, there's a new model on the horizon — at least for some of us. The HTC U11+ boasts a larger, taller screen, a souped-up battery, and Android Oreo out of the box. The U11+ won't be launching in the United States, possibly due to lack of carrier interest, possibly thanks to the woeful performance of the U Ultra just nine months ago. In the UK, it's being sold only through HTC's website, with none of the major networks or high street retailers picking up the device. And it's a shame to see such a limited release, because this is a really good phone — perhaps the most competitive HTC handset since the days of the M7 and M8.. We're publishing this review after twelve days with an unlocked Asia-model HTC U11+ (2Q4D100). I (Alex Dobie) used the U11+ primarily in Taipei, Taiwan in dual-SIM mode, with a Taiwan Mobile SIM and an EE (UK) SIM roaming on Chunghwa Telecom. I also used it in single-SIM mode (with the TWM SIM only) for two days during this time, in order to judge any performance or battery life differences without the second SIM.. The phone was running software version 1.05.709.12, based on Android 8.0 Oreo, with the October 1, 2017 Android security patch.. For the HTC faithful, the most notable change in the U11+ is its move to a taller aspect ratio, and with it, a welcome reduction in screen bezels. With its latest flagship, HTC finally joins the 18:9 club, with a display more in keeping with current flagship trends. The front face of the device isn't exactly bezelless — there's still both a forehead and chin to be seen here — but the borders have been trimmed down significantly from older HTC offerings, like the decidedly bezelly (non-Plus) U11. Accordingly, from the front, it no longer looks anywhere near as dated as its forerunners. Were it actually being sold in carrier stores in the West, it wouldn't look entirely out of place alongside a Galaxy S8 or Pixel 2 XL .. Of course, this is still an HTC U phone, and fittingly there's a gorgeous "liquid surface" curved glass panel around the back of the U11+, which is every bit as eye-catching as the other models in this series. This isn't just any old Gorilla Glass 5 panel — HTC uses multiple layers of the substance to give the rear of the U11+ a unique shimmer. I've been using the black version, which has more of a reflective gunmetal finish than the pitch black you might find around the back of a Samsung phone. There's also a blue model, which is more or less identical to the blue U11, and really unique translucent color option that won't be on sale in Europe until 2018.. HTC finally joins the 18:9 club.. HTC has changed more than just the dimensions in its latest phone. There are redesigned brushed aluminum side walls too, which are reminiscent of the old HTC 10, and as a result more angular, and a little easier to hold onto. Despite these design tweaks, this is still a supremely slippery phone. Between the 6-inch display diagonal and the very slick finish of the glass back, you may well want to take advantage of the protective case bundled in the box. And like all glass-backed phones, hairline scratches on the rear of the U11+ are basically an inevitability if you go without any sort of protection.. Incidentally, the taller screen means the fingerprint scanner now lives around the back of the phone, just below the single rear camera, and HTC has also reintroduced on-screen keys to its Android UI. For me, both are welcome changes.. There's a fair amount of heft to the U11+, in terms of both size and weight, but I don't really mind that. The phone feels solid and well-made, and a little more grown-up than the regular U11, which was trying a little too hard to be curvy. Unlike just about every other HTC phone, these extra-large proportions are filled out by an extra-large battery. Personally, I'm absolutely fine carrying a less svelte handset if it means I also get a gigantic battery.. The extra heft of the U11+ is filled out by an extra-large battery.. The front of the U11+ is featureless except for the earpiece, and a 6-inch SuperLCD 6 display at 2880x1440 resolution. (SuperLCD, like SuperAMOLED, is largely a meaningless marketing term; the "6" just signifies that HTC feels this screen is a generation above that of the regular U11's SuperLCD 5.) These 6-inch, 18:9 panels are increasingly becoming the new normal — the industry seems to be settling on this size as the new go-to standard for larger Android phones, and that's great. It works well on the U11+ just like it does on the Pixel 2 or LG V30 — though with significantly more heft than the LG phone. The panel itself is attractive, if not spectacular. It lacks the awesome daylight visibility of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 , and the punch of OLED in general, but on the whole, it looks good — there are no glaring issues here. The panel is tuned to DCI-P3 by default, but you can monkey with colors in the settings, including tweaking white balance and switching to sRGB mode for more accurate color reproduction.. Under the hood, HTC takes the core specs of the U11+ and layers on a few key upgrades, which means this is another rock-solid Android phone running Qualcomm's proven Snapdragon 835 platform. In the UK, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is the standard loadout — in some other places, like Taiwan, there's a 4GB-plus-64GB version as well. (As mentioned above, I've been using the 6+128 version.) The battery jumps to a whopping 3,930mAh, putting it in the same league as the Huawei Mate 10 , at least in terms of the numbers. (More on that later.) And the water resistance spec steps up to IP68 from the U11's IP67. Other specs are unchanged — Snapdragon 835, microSD expandability and Quick Charge 3, but no wireless charging.. There's still no headphone jack to be found, which I hate having to deal with in every phone that omits it. But alongside the standard 3.5mm dongle, HTC does include its pretty great USonic noise-canceling earbuds in the box, which impressively dampen background noise whether you're walking down the street, on a busy train carriage, or dealing with turbulence on a long-haul flight. Compared to some manufacturers, I at least feel like there's a decent trade-off for HTC's omission of the increasingly rare 3.5mm jack.. When you're not using earbuds, a U11-style BoomSound Hi-Fi setup, combining the earpiece speaker and a bottom firing woofer, provides about the very best on-device playback outside of the few phones that offer front-facing speakers. Audio quality is about on par with the U11 — reasonably loud, but sometimes lacking in bass. That's fine overall, though perhaps slightly disappointing for some — I do feel like there's probably room for front speakers in this design, particularly given the size of the top and bottom bezels.. New phones shipping with Oreo are still relatively few and far between, so it's great to see the HTC U11+ arriving with Android 8.0 out of the box. HTC's Sense customisations are still around too, and look mostly the same as on the U11 — as Android "skins" go, this remains a relatively light touch, with most of the underlying design direction appearing to have come from Google.. The most obvious change from earlier Sense versions can be seen on the home screen. New "squircle"-style icons (which I can take or leave) borrow a few visual cues from Samsung's current phones. Other core HTC Sense features remain largely unchanged from the U11. BlinkFeed fills the leftmost home screen panel with news and social updates. And the Sense Home launcher inherits a couple of fashionable features from other phones, letting you swipe up for the app drawer, or down for notifications. (Bafflingly, though, there's no option to swipe the fingerprint scanner to bring down the notification shade.). HTC's UI combines mostly stock Oreo with one or two differentiating software tricks.. These few changes don't do much to alleviate the general staleness of Sense, however. Many Sense apps haven't changed in years, whether it's the Dialer and Messages apps unchanged from the 2015's One M9, or the weather animations that date all the way back to 2011's Sensation. The combination of Sense-plus-Oreo looks fine and is perfectly pleasant to use, with pastel colors, light accents, and clean lines. But this is far from the overhaul that I think HTC's UI really needs.. HTC has at least built out its squeezy 'Edge Sense' capabilities — the function introduced in the U11, which lets you perform certain actions by squeezing the sides of the phone. More actions in specific apps are now supported, including Google Calendar, Facebook, Instagram and Google Photos. And there's also a way to map specific functions of other apps to a squeeze as well, through a kind of recording function, which tells Android to simulate a tap in a certain area when you squeeze in a particular app. This feels a little clumsy, particularly because it creates complications when you're in landscape mode, but overall it works well enough.. The new Edge Launcher feature is another Edge Sense addition. Similar to Samsung's Edge Panels, it gives you a couple of wheels of shortcuts, alongside a quick calendar view. Wheels of shortcuts — either apps or quick settings — can be realigned to either edge, accommodating both right-handed users and lefties.. Personally, I've found Edge Sense works pretty well as a quick camera shortcut — it's really helpful to not have to fumble around and double-tap that power button. But I've mostly ignored all the other stuff it can do. In other apps, it's usually easier to just tap the screen, as opposed to adjusting your grip and clumsily squeezing. (I've also noticed fewer instances of blurry shots when I do use Edge Sense to take a photo — the software will wait a second to make sure everything's stable before shooting, which is a welcome improvement from the U11.). More than nine months on, HTC Sense Companion still isn't anywhere near useful.. HTC Boost+, the company's dubious performance-boosting app, now appears to come with adds enabled by default on the U11+. HTC's touch response continues to rank among the best on any Android phone. The hacked Google Pixel 2 HDR+ camera app works great on the U11+, about matching the performance of Google's handsets in the challenging situations where it shows. But of course as we'll get to later, HTC's own camera app also does a fantastic job on this phone.. At the same time, Sense Companion, which was useless on the U Ultra and useless on the U11, is just as much of a waste of space on the U11+. HTC's on-device AI thing didn't show me a single useful piece of information in a week or so of use. And any utility it might offer is undone by occasional crazy suggestions, like telling me to wake up early for a co-worker's doctor's appointment on another continent, or telling me tomorrow's weather in my home country while I'm traveling overseas. It's tripped up way too often by travel, or shared Google calendars, and should either be given the engineering work it sorely needs, or be scrapped entirely.. HTC's software still has the fundamentals down, though. It's insanely fast — every bit as performant as Google's Pixel phones — and doesn't add too much cruft on top of stock Android. To me, that speed and clarity are worth the one or two superfluous features that I can easily disable.. The U11+ boasts the kind of battery capacity which basically guarantees you solid longevity. And in its latest phone, HTC takes advantage of an almost 4,000mAh cell ensure a full day between charges, even with heavy use. The only time I needed an evening re-charge was in dual-SIM mode, using the phone continually for YouTube streaming over LTE, occasional music playback and social networking, and a few hours of 4G tethering. With lighter use, you'll manage a day and a half with ease. This isn't really a two-day phone, though. I still feel like Huawei's Mate 10 Pro gets slightly more mileage from a similar sized battery, possibly due to software tuning, or its use of a lower-res OLED display.. I should also point out that I noticed higher than average standby power draw in dual-SIM mode — noticeably more than with other Snapdragon 835 phones. It's possible this was due to the quirks of roaming on a UK SIM on a Taiwanese network. Using the phone in single-SIM mode, with just a Taiwan Mobile SIM installed, produced standby times more in line with dual-SIM contemporaries like the Huawei Mate 10 Pro and OnePlus 5T.. Unsurprisingly, it's really hard to kill off the U11+'s almost 4,000mAh cell in under a day.. When I was really pushing the U11+ in dual-SIM mode, I'd get between 18 and 19 hours per charge, with screen-on times between four and seven hours. As always, it depends on what you're doing.. In any case, if you're caught short, HTC still offers both regular and extreme power-saving modes, the former of which saved my bacon on one occasion, while out recording video after a long day of general use.. When it's time to recharge, the bundled Quick Charge 3 brick will quickly bring you out of the danger zone if you forget to charge overnight, and the phone also supports quick charging over USB-PD. Charging speeds aren't quite up to the level of OnePlus's Dash Charge or Huawei's SuperCharge, but you'll still be able to pull enough power to see you through the day in the time it takes to take a shower and eat a quick breakfast.. The U11+'s main camera packs the exact same hardware found on the standard model — a 12-megapixel Sony sensor with 1.4-micron pixels, and optical stabilization, behind an f/1.7 lens. And like the regular U11, the Plus leans heavily on HTC's HDR Boost technology, which helps it capture more color detail in night shots, and gather more dynamic range from most scenes in general. This is basically, HTC's answer to Google's HDR+ cameras.. Fittingly, HTC's HDR Boost-equipped camera the closest I've seen another manufacturer come to matching the HDR+ features of the Pixel 2. Google is still unchallenged when it comes to noise reduction and extreme low-light photography, thanks to that computational edge. (Google's Panorama mode is also infinitely superior to HTC's, for what that's worth.) Nevertheless, the U11+ is a very close competitor, and for my money, it's essentially a coin toss between the U11+ and the Huawei Mate 10 for the number-two spot.. Basically, this is the U11's camera with slightly upgraded software.. As a particular point of strength, HTC's camera is superb at pulling lots of color out of night scenes, and pulling more dynamic range out of challenging light in general. And unlike the early days of the U11, the camera no longer tends towards over-exposing darker scenes quite so much. HDR Boost also seems a little quicker than I remember it being on the U11, possibly thanks to software enhancement, or the extra couple gigs of RAM compared to the 4GB U11 I was using earlier in the year.. And although at first I made fun of HTC's ability to take photos with a squeeze of the bezel, I was actually able to capture few unique angles with HTC's squeezy shutter shortcut — shots that would've been almost impossible to capture while reaching for the on-screen shutter key. (See the shot of the cat in the gallery below.). In every other way, this setup is identical to the camera of the U11. The main thing you don't get here that many competing phones do offer is portrait mode, which may or may not be a big deal for you. Personally, I can live without it. But in the coming year, expect this to become a table-stakes feature for all high-end phone cameras.. Around the front, an 8-megapixel camera and f/2.0 lens aims to up the U11+'s selfie game, particularly in darker conditions. I've found the results closely match the very similar setup used in the Google Pixel 2, though obviously without that phone's front-facing portrait mode option. Once again, in selfie mode, the U11+'s squeezy shutter shortcut comes into play, allowing for easier captures when contorting your thumb towards the on-screen controls isn't an option.. Should you buy the HTC U11+? Yes, if you can. The U11+ is almost certainly the flagship HTC should've released six months ago. This phone looks more modern than the regular U11 — and with a bigger battery, higher specs, a sharper design and more fleshed-out Edge Sense options it's way more competitive in the market in general. In the UK, its 699-pound price point — or 629 if you can find it on sale — makes it comfortably more affordable than the Pixel 2 XL, and a genuine competitor to the more widely-ranged Huawei Mate 10 Pro.. The worst thing you can say about the U11+ is that it's yet another excellent phone in a year overflowing with great new Android handsets. It's tough to stand out, and the U11+'s true differentiating features — battery life, software quality and day-to-day performance — don't make for an easy sell.. This is the phone HTC should've released six months ago.. Nevertheless, the U11+ makes the strongest case yet for HTC's continued presence in the smartphone market. For the first time in a while, I feel like HTC kinda has its mojo back — at least on the product side.. Availability is another question altogether, though. If you're in the UK, the only place to buy a U11+ is direct from HTC, and in the U.S., there are no launch plans at all. For that reason, it's unlikely this phone will do much to move the needle for the company.. But assuming you can buy it, the U11+ is a top-notch Oreo-powered flagship with solid construction, a beautiful glass design whether you go mirrored or translucent, and differentiation through clean software, a fantastic camera and dependable battery life. It might not be as exciting as a Note 8 or a Pixel 2 XL, but it's just as worthy of your attention, and your money..

It also has HTC BoomSound™ Hi-Fi edition [ clarification needed ] stereo speakers where the headphone acts as the tweeter while the bottom firing speaker acts as the woofer. Dust and water resistance are included with an IP67 certification. The phone ships with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset and includes either 4 GB RAM and 64 GB of storage or 6. The HTC U11 ships with Android 7.1 Nougat with an overlay of HTC Sense UI. HTC is also currently rolling out Android 8.0 Oreo (without the Treble feature for device independent system updates) [1] updates for the phone via OTA. Google Assistant , Amazon Alexa and Baidu Duer (China only) [4] are pre-installed. Alexa only became available on 17 July 2017. [2] HTC Sense Companion is installed to make personalized suggestions by learning from daily routines and suggestions based on the user's location. On 15 June 15 2017, Chang Chia-lin, the president of HTC's smartphone and connected device division, stated that the HTC U11 had been selling better than its predecessors, the HTC One M9 and the HTC 10. HTC unveiled an upgraded version of the U11, the U11+ , on November 2, 2017. It features a 6-inch 18:9 display with thinner bezels, a larger battery, a rear-mounted fingerprint reader, IP68 certification for dust and water resistance, and is pre-loaded with Android 8.0 Oreo. The Verge reported via internal sources that the U11+ had previously been developed as a successor to the original Pixel XL smartphone HTC had developed with Google, under the codename "Muskie", but that it had been shelved in favor of a version produced by LG instead, and was re-engineered into an update to the U11. ^ a b c Here are all the phones updated to support Project Treble. ^ a b "Phonearena". ^ a b "HTC U11 | HTC United Kingdom". ^ "HTC U11 enjoys strong sales".

The HTC U11 for Sprint is the best music phone around, and its unusual squeeze sensor is a fun new way to interact with a mobile device.. HTC needs to face the music. The company's passion for sound has come through in its phones for years, and I hear it again in the $696 U11 for Sprint, a shimmery slab of audio excellence. There's more going on with the $696 U11, as it's also the first US phone with always-on Alexa support. But if you're going to pick one reason to buy it right now, it's the sound. Otherwise, the Galaxy S8 remains a slightly more well-rounded device, and our Editors' Choice.. There are actually two U11 models: one for Sprint, and an unlocked model (available for $649 from HTC.com) that will work on the three other major US carriers. Many of the other reviews you see out there will be for the unlocked unit, which has slightly different firmware.. The first thing you notice about the phone is the design. The U11 is shimmery and gorgeous. It comes in black or silver, but the color you really want is the deep, automotive-paint blue. There's a big price to pay for the baked-in, unscratchable color, though: The phone is a fingerprint magnet, and it'll be perpetually greasy unless you go for a (clear, please) case.. View All 10 Photos in Gallery. I've been very spoiled by narrow phones like the Samsung Galaxy S8 , the LG G6, and the BlackBerry KeyOne recently. At 6.07 by 2.99 by 0.31 inches and 5.96 ounces, the U11 is a standard size for a 16:9, 5.5-inch phone, but it still feels too wide in my hand. The sleek back turns slippery quickly, and especially when trying to squeeze the edges of the phone, it feels like you can drop it.. The 2,560-by-1,440, Super LCD 5 is visible outdoors and in, and looks razor sharp. Below it, there's a fingerprint sensor/home button flanked by two fixed, capacitive keys. On the sides of the phone, invisible, there's the innovative "squeeze" section, a pressure sensor that can launch the camera, flashlight, or any other app.. The phone is IP67 water resistant, which means it can be dunked in up to three feet of water for 30 minutes. HTC's previous generations of phones weren't water resistant, but competing flagships from other manufacturers tend to be now.. The U11 initially billed itself as Sprint's first gigabit LTE phone, although Sprint says that it removed the gigabit badge after launch. We tested it against a Samsung Galaxy S8 using our field test software and didn't see any advantage for the U11. Comparing three locations with good Sprint signal in Manhattan, we got an average of 29.2Mbps down on the S8 as compared with 23.6Mbps on the U11.. That said, you'll find a dramatic improvement in Sprint coverage in weak signal situations when compared with older phones. The U11, like the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 , has HPUE (high performance user equipment), which we've seen improve Sprint signal in several different tests.. Performance on other US carriers with the unlocked model should be very good, but will probably fall short of the Galaxy S7 and S8, as the U11 lacks the 4x4 MIMO antennas for other carriers' bands. It has all of the bands T-Mobile and Verizon use, but lacks AT&T's supplementary bands 29 and 30, which help in high-traffic areas.. Battery life on the 3,000mAh cell was good, at seven hours and one minute of LTE video streaming with the screen on full brightness. The phone supports Qualcomm's quick charge technology, but not wireless charging.. The U11 runs Android 7.1 with HTC's relatively aggressive skin. The skin doesn't hold back performance: With the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor platform on board, we got absolutely terrific benchmark scores and all-around smooth performance.. There's 64GB of storage, 11.54GB of which is taken up by system files, plus room for a microSD card in the nano SIM card slot.. See How We Test Cell Phones. The most exciting new feature, of course, is the squeeze sensor, which HTC calls Edge Sense. There's a sensor area about two-thirds of the way down the sides of the phone you can calibrate to your liking when you set the phone up. Then, when you squeeze it, it'll launch the camera or the flashlight. It's completely customizable — you can use it to launch any app, and HTC says it'll release an app that lets it hook into other apps on your phone as a click action within the apps.. It's not going to change your life. But it's a useful gimmick, much like Motorola's twist-to-camera feature. I ended up using it less than I thought I would, though, because I found the U11 to be a little uncomfortably wide to securely grip and squeeze in my hand. Folks with larger hands will likely get more use out of it.. HTC's most imposing change is to put NewsRepublic news headlines on your lock screen. Turn it off, and you'll still get aggressive NewsRepublic alerts in your notifications. Fortunately, you can disable NewsRepublic entirely. You'll still see news headlines in Blinkfeed, the Flipboard-like page that's to the left of the main home screen (pictured above).. There's also the mystery that is HTC's Sense Companion. It's supposed to suggest local attractions to you and things like when to recharge your phone, but I didn't get any suggestions from it during my test period. It may simply need more time to work.. There's a bit of other bloatware on the phone: UA Record, a fitness app that's part of HTC's deal with UnderArmour; Viveport, HTC and Valve's VR app store; Boost, a memory optimization app; and HTC's Zoe video editor. In general, though, HTC manages to hold off from adding too many redundant apps. The browser is Chrome, the photo app is Google Photos, and the music app is Google Play Music.. One of the U11's most interesting features cannot be tested right now: It's the first "dual wake word" phone. That means you can say "OK Google" to get the Google Assistant, or "Alexa" to wake up Amazon's voice assistant. You can even switch back and forth, query by query, depending on which one tends to give the best responses.. Alexa will be a downloadable add-on you'll be able to get later this summer. And there are some potential kinks to work out: You'll probably have to set all of your Amazon Echo devices to a different wake word, or the phone and your Echos will fight over your query.. But with the growing popularity of Alexa, it's worth keeping an eye out for this feature. No other carrier-sold phone in the US lets you holler "Alexa!" to wake up Amazon's assistant. And for what it's worth, OK Google works fine, just as it does on other leading Android phones.. The U11 is the best music phone we've tested. In speakerphone or music playback mode, HTC uses a speaker on top as a "tweeter," while the main speaker, on the bottom, is a more powerful "woofer." The top speaker basically offers a little bit of high-end enhancement, but the overall effect is more than the sum of its parts — a noticeably richer sound than on most other phones.. If you intend to use the included earbuds, they're a treat. HTC includes special Usonic USB-C earphones that only work with this phone. They use a sonar-like technology to map your hearing and equalize the phone's sound to compensate. It's an especially effective technology for older ears, like mine: With Usonic, I got to hear a lot more high-end than I usually do, because that part of my hearing is shot. The earbuds also do a little bit of active noise cancellation when they're playing music, although it isn't active when music isn't playing.. There's no headphone jack, but HTC supplies a special dongle with its own DAC in it. Paired with super-high-end headphones, even my tired, old ears could hear the difference when compared with the otherwise excellent Galaxy S8: The U11 has more detailed highs, better texture and shape to sound, and longer decay. This is the first convincing argument I've heard for using a dongle.. There's one exception to the U11's audio excellence: If you rely on wireless headphones, the phone doesn't stand apart. It's even a step behind the Galaxy S8. With Bluetooth 4.2 rather than Bluetooth 5.0, it can't do the new trick of playing to two sets of headphones at once, and the sound quality of Bluetooth audio is dependent on the encoding scheme, not the phone's own amp.. The U11 has a 16-megapixel front-facing camera and a 12-megapixel rear camera. The phone records "3D audio" surround stereo using its four microphones.. Still camera quality wasn't quite up to the fearsome standards of the Galaxy S8 in testing. I know this is an area where my results differ from other early reviews, and the difference may be that my phone is using Sprint firmware while other reviewers are using international units. HTC told me that the international models have a newer version of the camera software than the Sprint units do.. So, that said, the U11 took slightly washed-out photos where the blacks weren't as deep and true as on the S8. In low light, it managed to eke images out of even very dark surroundings, but at the cost of some blur and precision. The front-facing camera gave me a lot of pixels, but in dimly light scenarios, the images were aggressively filtered and sharpened. HTC says camera upgrades will come.. I know people are going to be a little skeptical considering HTC's heavy photo focus in its marketing, but the proof is in the images below. The top one was taken with the U11, the bottom one with the S8.. Video recording had fewer caveats than still photos. Videos in both 1080p and 4K were smooth and clear, with stabilization available on the 1080p clips.. HTC has spun out a confusing and unconvincing set of phones so far this year. Seeing the U11, clearly HTC's flagship, I wonder why the HTC U Ultra and HTC U Play came out at all — although they didn't fully come out in the US, with neither phone getting official carrier support.. There's also a lot of unrealized promise inherent in the HTC U11—features we couldn't quite test. Alexa integration, for instance, sounds great but isn't here yet. Sense Companion doesn't seem to do much. We would love to see Gigabit LTE restored. And HTC is promising camera software upgrades to fix the image issues we saw during testing.. The U11 is the best competition for the Galaxy S8 on Sprint. We're going to keep our Editors' Choice with the S8 for its superior camera and network performance in our tests. Even if the U11's spec sheet says differently, we have to go by our results. But while the U11 doesn't outpace the S8, I'd suggest it to audiophiles for whom music and speakerphone are primary uses. And we'll take another look at it in the months ahead, to see if this promising phone evolves into a real winner.. Bottom Line: The HTC U11 for Sprint is the best music phone around, and its unusual squeeze sensor is a fun new way to interact with a mobile device..

Update 7/17/17: HTC has pushed out the Alexa update to all users (you can learn how to use it here ) and the U11 is available in a cool new solar red color .. The annals of Android are littered with one-and-done gimmicks that were originally hailed as the next big thing. Indeed, from slide-out game pads to built-in projectors, way too many Android phones have included features that never caught on. So, will the new Edge Sense feature in the HTC U11 meet a similar fate? Probably. But the U11 is still a great phone that’s fun to use.. A more pocketable version of the ill-conceived U Ultra , HTC’s newest flagship isn’t just another spec’d-out handset with good looks and a great camera. The new Edge Sense feature lets you launch apps and actions by squeezing the sides of the phone. It’s a gimmick for sure, but one of the funnest gimmicks ever to grace an Android handset.. It’s great to see HTC thinking outside the box, and with the U11, HTC is making a statement : Anyone can make a powerful phone, but remember when these handheld computers used to be delightful too?. If you’ve ever seen a U Ultra in the flesh, the U11 will be instantly familiar. From the front, it looks exactly the same as the U Ultra, with the off-center camera, pill-shaped home button/fingerprint sensor, and extra-large forehead and chin. A textured power button is still unfortunately positioned below the volume rocker.. The HTC U11 features the same “liquid” enclosure as the U Ultra, but the camera bump has been toned down.. Flip it over, and the U11 is even more reminiscent of the U Ultra. The back plate uses the same “liquid” surface, which looks just as stunning as it does on the U11’s big brother, despite the persistence of the microphone hole, which mars the liquid effect a bit. The Ultra’s signature Sapphire Blue color remains and HTC has added an Iron Man-style solar red as well.. If Iron Man used an Android smartphone, it would be the HTC U11 in solar red.. You’ll find some other small design changes, like a round camera instead of a square one, a far-less-protrusive camera bump, and slightly less tapered edges. But HTC has fully embraced its new design language with the U11, putting all traces of the antenna lines and speaker grills of the HTC 10 and One M9 firmly in the past.. While the U11 and U Ultra may share many of the same visual cues, the similarities end when you pick it up. Gone is the U Ultra’s second screen. And where the Ultra was monstrous and cumbersome, the 5.5-inch U11 is downright svelte. Its smooth contours let it rest naturally in your hand with a glass back that somehow feels more luxurious than the glass on the Galaxy S8 or the LG G6.. The U11 (left) is much more pocketable than the enormous U Ultra.. One of the many complaints I have with the U Ultra is that its enormous size makes it far too prone to dropping when holding it with one hand. The U11 fixes that with not just smaller dimensions, but also (apparently) a change in materials.. I repeatedly rubbed my fingers across the back of each phone, and the U11 felt tackier and more resistant to gliding. The new liquid design phone is still a fingerprint magnet, but the U11 seems to pick up fewer smudges than the U Ultra.. After the LG G6, the Galaxy S8, and now the Essential Phone, we have certain expectations for screen-to-body ratio in new flagship handsets. The U11’s bezels are about as big as the eight-month-old Pixel’s, and its 71 percent screen-to-body ratio makes it look more like a budget phone and less like a premium one.. The U11 is proud of its bezels and does nothing to hide them.. But just because its Super LCD5 Quad HD screen doesn’t stretch to the edges doesn’t mean you’re getting an inferior product. At 534 ppi, its display has a higher pixel density than the U Ultra’s 513ppi, and despite sticking with an LCD panel, the U11 is just as bright and vibrant as its OLED peers. Elsewhere, you get a Snapdragon 835 chip, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage, all of which add up to a phone that can stand shoulder to the shoulder with the G6s and S8s of the world.. The U11 doesn’t have a headphone jack, but its bundled USB-C USonic earbuds sound quite good.. Audio buffs will be bummed to learn that the U11 doesn’t return the headphone jack that was cut from the U Ultra. That said, HTC has included a 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter this time around. Also in the box is a pair of noise-canceling USonic earbuds that use the phone’s ear-scanning wizardry to deliver the best possible audio profile for each user. It seems like a bunch of hooey, but as with the U Ultra, HTC’s audio prowess is on point here.. The HTC U11 has a top-notch processor and camera, and its Edge Sense quick-launch feature is a gimmick that's super fun.. Fixes most of the U Ultra's problems. Edge Sense is a fun way to launch apps. Incredibly fast with a great camera.. PCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done..

One of the HTC U11's stand-out features is that it can detect when it is being squeezed, and the action can trigger an array of functions - launching the flashlight or taking a photo, for instance. That aside, the HTC U11 follows in the footsteps of previous HTC U phones, sporting a glass back with eye-catching, highly reflective iridescent paintjob. Specs are top-notch, as the case with any high-end Android smartphone should be. And if you're willing to pay the hefty $650 to own one, you'll get a pair of nifty noise-cancellation earphones in the box.. HTC U11 Review HTC U11 manual HTC U11 benchmarks. OS: Android (8.0, 7.1), HTC Sense UI. Dimensions: 6.06 x 2.99 x 0.31 inches (153.9 x 75.9 x 7.9 mm). Weight: 5.96 oz (169 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Materials: Main body: Glass; Accents: Metal. Features: Fingerprint (touch), Touch sensitive control keys. IP certified - The IP code indicates the degree of protection against dust and water. The first number represents dust protection, while the second represents water protection. In IP67, for example, 6 means a completely dust-tight device, while 7 means the device can stay immersed in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes. In IP68, a higher level of water protection is expected, but exact numbers aren't specified: both depth and continuance are specified by the manufacturer on per device basis.. Display Physical size: 5.5 inches. Resolution: 1440 x 2560 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 5), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed.

The HTC U11 is a wildly impressive phone - in a sea of wildly impressive phones. The core abilities will wow any HTC fan, but the squeezable sides really fail to impress.. HTC U11 price See the best HTC U11 deals Design Two-tone shimmer impresses Well-built chassis Back sucks in fingerprints hugely Screen High resolution Slightly dim Auto brightness not perfect. Update: Amazon's Alexa AI assistant is now available on the HTC U11 and we've put it through its paces and updated this review with our findings.. If you're an HTC fan – good news. HTC has brought you a phone that, in many ways, is as good as you could hope for.. It's got a hugely impressive spec list, unique design, innovation in the form of squeezable sides and a great camera, and since launch it's got that little bit better, thanks to the addition of Amazon Alexa.. The latest processor buzzes along rapidly inside a phone that's neither too big nor overly compact, and the interface is as slick as anything HTC has ever made.. In fact, if you're a fan of HTC above all other phone manufacturers, you can probably skip this whole review and just buy the thing (although we suggest you read the bit about the ‘squeezable’ Edge Sense element, as that takes a bit of getting used to) and just wait feverishly at the front door, waiting for your HTC U11 to arrive.. However, for everyone else, things are a bit more complicated. Yes, HTC has pretty much nailed the spec list, but it's doing so for a rather high price – and one which pits it against some strong alternative options.. It's launching into a world where Samsung and LG have come up with beautiful screen designs, and Sony has wheeled out the big guns to bring a 4K screen and superb slow motion video to the Xperia XZ Premium .. HTC, in comparison, hasn't really done a huge amount different to previous years, but it’s largely got things right. So could this still be the phone for you?. 153.9 x 75.9 x 7.9mm OS : Android 7.1 Screen size : 5.5-inch Resolution :. 1440 x 2560 CPU : Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 RAM : 4GB / 6GB* Storage : 64GB / 128GB* Battery : 3,000mAh Rear camera : 12MP Front camera : 16MP. In the UK, the HTC U11 is coming for a cost of £649 SIM free, which is among the higher prices on the market. It's a bit cheaper on contract - under £30 a month with some decent upfront payments - but that still makes it more expensive than the Samsung Galaxy S8.. In the US, it's $649 unlocked from HTC, or it's a Sprint exclusive for $29 per month (with no upfront payment).. In Australia, it's AU$999 for the unlocked phone, and from around AU$59 per month if you want it on contract.. That's pretty expensive, even though it offers some of the top spec around - so you'll need to be sure you're into what HTC is offering before you pay those higher prices.. The design of the HTC U11 is something that takes a little getting used to – but it's worth taking the time to do so. Holding it in the hand for the first time is a little underwhelming, as the polished Gorilla Glass is so light that it feels a little plasticky in the hand.. The bulbous nature isn't as exciting or feel as premium as the metal build on last year's HTC 10 , but don't let that bother you. After a few days you'll get used to the way it feels – and the HTC U11's chassis is well built and solid.. Aesthetically, the U11 appeals in a way we've not seen with many phones. The Liquid Surface design manages to offer two colors at once, with the 'Amazing Silver' and ‘Brilliant Black’ models we tested looking more blue/purple and black/green respectively, depending on the way you hold them.. There's also Solar Red, Ice White and. Sapphire Blue - and the red is easily our favorite, as you can see below.. Image 1 of 6 How the Solar Red HTC U11 changes from gold to red.

The only saving grace is the fact that your prints wipe off easily, but the overall effect is diminished somewhat. There is a clear plastic cover in the box, which doesn't ruin the look of the phone while keeping it cleaner, but even that’s prone to the odd smudge.. It's also annoying to put any phone, designed to be held in the palm, in a case... and it's a particular issue with a phone you're going to have to squeeze to use.. In terms of the rest of the design, the U11 doesn't reinvent anything, with HTC instead putting together a phone with all the right bits in the correct places.. The fingerprint scanner on the front, in the (non-clickable) home key, is easy to hit and works almost flawlessly. Perhaps we're willing to give it more credit after Samsung played 'hide the scanner' on the back of its Galaxy S8 , but this feels just right.. The rounded glass on the HTC U11 is probably one of the most striking things about the handset day to day, and it's something HTC put a lot of effort into for good reason.. Yes, this is still the same ‘black rectangle’ design that so many other devices offer, but it’s got a foundation of quality and striking colors.. The volume rocker and power buttons on the right-hand side fit nicely under a thumb or forefinger, depending on your dominant hand, and otherwise things are very clean around the edge of the U11.. That's partly because the phone is waterproof to IP67 rating meaning you can throw it into water, but in real life you can just dunk it in shallow water, bring it in the shower or wash it clean without having to spend an extraordinarily large amount of money and shame getting it fixed.. One of the issues we have with this phone is there's no headphone jack on this phone, as HTC decided to follow Apple and Motorola's lead and drop the port in favor of a single slot.. The USB-C port on the bottom of the phone will serve as the power and sound portal for most, which means it'll irk if you need to get some juice in while listening to your top tunes.. Overall, we're big fans of the way that HTC has redefined its design strategy. There are only so many ways you can make a phone look iconic these days, and HTC has built well on its design heritage in the smartphone space to deliver something you'd be proud to put down on the table.. The screen on the HTC U11 is something that’s tricky to review. Until recently the 5.5-inch display would have easily ticked all the boxes, as it does very little wrong.. It's large, bright and clear, with the QHD (1440 x 2560) resolution offering as much clarity as anyone could want while still, seemingly, preserving enough battery life.. However, with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 now on the market, there's something archaic about how the screen on the HTC U11 looks. The bezels appear massive, the screen boxy and it just feels... However, if you're not bothered about those other phones, then you won't want for any better features on the HTC U11's screen – but don't put it side by side with the Samsung Galaxy S8 if you don’t want to be nagged by doubts about your phone choice.. While the screen is clear and bright in most situations, it can be reflective, and it's not as bright as we've seen on other handsets. There were times when trying to watch Netflix outside proved a challenge in terms of of angling the handset the right way, and only in the shade did it really start to show off the power of what the HTC U11 can do.. It's also not the brightest screen on the market, which shows that the new wave of shoving HDR compatibility into handsets is perhaps something HTC should have looked into.. The auto-brightness is still something HTC needs to work on, as it doesn't dynamically alter well enough at all – blinding in the night and not bright enough when heading outside. It should be able to work across all areas of the brightness spectrum, but we found ourselves heading into the notification bar to to tweak the levels too many times for our liking.. You won't miss too much from the screen on the HTC U11 – it's one of the better options on the market thanks to using the ever-evolving Super LCD technology – but it's not as impressive as other flagships on the market..

After the disappointing, incremental updates of the One M8 and M9 , last year’s HTC 10. showed that the Taiwanese company still has ambitions in the smartphone market. The phone was deservedly popular with reviewers, but sadly failed to ignite public excitement.. is a much more dramatic departure from past flagships like the HTC 10, switching brushed aluminum for an eye-catching liquid-glass finish wrapped around a powerful, squeezable smartphone that offers tempting features. We think it’s excellent competition against flagships like the LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8. thanks to a stellar camera, and fluid performance. The most noticeable feature of the HTC U11 is its liquid-glass surface. The U11 is one of the shiniest phones we’ve ever handled, and you really do need to see it in person to get an idea of how the refractive minerals baked into the glass change color as you tilt the phone. The eye-catching red U11 changes to gold, the white shows all the colors of the rainbow, and the black has a subtle hint of green. Our silver review unit is more of a light blue, but there is also a darker blue option.. HTC’s glass doesn’t just look good, it also curves slightly –on the front and back — to seamlessly blend into an aluminum frame. It’s very comfortable to hold, and the rear finish feels more like plastic in the hand than glass, because it warms to the touch quickly. The immediately obvious downside to an almost mirrored back is that it picks up grubby fingerprints and smudges. If you want to maintain its good looks, carry a microfiber cloth in your pocket, and be prepared to polish.. The next most visible feature is the U11’s size — this phone is big. The U11 has a 5.5-inch display, but the front has a spacious edges above and below. Even compared to last year’s Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , which also has a 5.5-inch display, the U11 feels big. Put it next to the impossibly slim Galaxy S8 , which packs a larger 5.8-inch display, and the U11 feels monstrous.. It would be fair to say that HTC is not yet onboard with the bezel-less trend, or the new, longer 18:9 screen format that LG introduced with the G6. This could be a difficult obstacle for HTC to overcome, because, unlike Samsung and LG, the company does not have its own display division. From the front, the U11 looks undeniably dated and the S8 and G6 are much easier to manage one-handed. The HTC U11 has a Super LCD 5 screen with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, which offers a sharp 590 pixels-per-inch. It’s comfortable to read on for long periods, and games and movies look good. The brightness is limited, however, which can be a problem in direct sunlight.. The HTC U11 is silky smooth and lightning fast.. It’s debatable how important the elongated screen and tiny bezels are, but the lack of anything special in this department is certainly a weak point for the U11.. Below the screen there’s a recessed, glass fingerprint sensor. It’s usually fast and responsive, but we did find that it was triggered by our palm accidentally, more often than we’d have liked, and it occasionally took a couple of tries to unlock. The fingerprint sensor is flanked by capacitive touch buttons for back and recent apps. They only light up when pressed and there’s vibration feedback.. Look at the bottom edge and you’ll see that HTC has also made the switch to USB Type-C. You won’t find a 3.5mm audio jack on this phone, but HTC has provided USB Type-C earphones and an adapter in the box.. Using the HTC U11 is silky smooth and lightning fast. Navigating around, jumping in and out of apps, and gaming are hitch-free. That shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, considering the U11 is packing a Snapdragon 835 backed by 4GB of RAM.. We played Injustice 2 , Super Mario Run , and Asphalt Extreme, and didn’t encounter any performance issues at all. This phone is a dream for gaming. The Snapdragon 835 is Qualcomm’s current top of the line and it offers significant performance and efficiency boosts over previous chips. It debuted in the Galaxy S8, but you won’t find it in many other phones just yet — a boon for HTC.. When we ran the benchmarks on our HTC U11, the scores were impressive:. For comparison, the S8 scored 2,052, 155,253, and 1,762 single core, 5,723 multi core in the same tests, respectively, whereas the G6 (which has the older Snapdragon 821) scored 2,102 in 3D Mark, and 135,032 in AnTuTu.. The vast majority of Android phones we’ve owned have exhibited some increased sluggishness over time, so we’ll be interested to see if the U11 slows down. Right now, it’s one of the fastest phones we’ve ever used, and it has more than enough power for most people.. If you’re wondering about storage, the base model offers an ample 64GB with room for expansion via a MicroSD card slot.. One of the headline features for the HTC U11 is called Edge Sense and it allows you to squeeze the bottom edges of the handset to perform a variety of shortcuts, such as launching the camera, and snapping a photo. You can also configure it to launch Google Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa , turn on Wi-Fi or the flashlight, record your voice, or launch any other app of your choice. Since release HTC has updated the Edge Sense functionality further, so that you can squeeze to trigger actions within apps and games. This means it can be used to zoom in on Google Maps or make Mario jump in Super Mario Run .. It’s easy to set up and you’re prompted to try it out when you first turn on your U11. There are sensors running down each side of the phone that start below the power button. You can set the force you’re comfortable using, and vibration feedback as well as an onscreen animation will let you know it’s working. If you find you’re activating it accidentally, you can re-calibrate it to require more force.. If you enable advanced mode, you can set one action for a short squeeze and a different one for a squeeze and hold. This takes a little practice to master. By default, one squeeze will launch the camera and you can squeeze again to snap a photo. This may sound like a bit of a gimmick, but it’s actually a step forward towards a button-less phone design. HTC is trying to ease us gently into the idea with Edge Sense, and we expect further developments in this direction if it proves popular.. We had doubts about its usefulness to begin with, but there are situations where Edge Sense works nicely. The default camera launch is a quick shortcut and the ability to squeeze again to capture a photo, coupled with the reflective back, means you can easily use the rear camera for superior selfies. It also works when the U11’s screen, or your hands, are wet.. If you live somewhere cold and use gloves, then we can see Edge Sense coming in handy once more. It’s not an earth-shattering feature, but it’s interesting, and it’s nice to see HTC is still innovating. As smartphones lose the bezels and buttons, we are going to need new ways of interacting with them and squeezing feels like a natural gesture.. The HTC U11 runs Android 7.1.1 with the Sense user interface on top. It’s not too far away from stock Android, and it will be instantly accessible for anyone who has used Android before. HTC is mostly content to employ Google’s suite of apps instead of doubling up with inferior versions of its own, as some Android manufacturers unfortunately still insist on doing.. The HTC U11 has the distinction of being the first phone with hands-free Amazon Alexa support. It’s not the only phone with Alexa, as Huawei rolled out Alexa support on the Mate 9 at the end of March. But the U11’s Snapdragon 835 processor supports activation of two hands-free services at the same time.. The Alexa app, like Alexa on the Huawei Mate 9, doesn’t show visuals like the Amazon’s Echo Show speaker. But it can do almost everything else Alexa can do on Amazon’s Echo speakers, including smart home control, weather reports, news, traffic, alarms, calendar support, and plenty more. It also has access to Amazon’s collection of 10,000 skills in the Alexa store.. AI helpers are often of dubious helpfulness, but much depends on what you expect. Alexa worked quite well on the U11 — even from the phone’s lockscreen. It answered trivia questions, gave us the weather report, and gave us local commute times.. better than expected, but it’s not a reason to buy the phone.. It’s another AI assistant (which debuted on the HTC U Ultra ), but don’t worry, because you can still long press the fingerprint sensor to launch Google Assistant. Sense Companion doesn’t compete as a voice assistant — it’s like a layer on your smartphone that learns by snooping on your activity (if you choose to allow it), and then offers up suggestions you might like.. The Sense Companion served up useful contextual suggestions. It reminded us to dress for rain when it was wet, it optimized a few apps to boost battery life, and it recommended some nearby eateries for lunch. It also tracks your activity, providing a weekly step count report, highlights points of interest when you’re out and about, and gives you traffic updates that might impact your commute.. It’s more useful than Google Now with preemptive suggestions, because it pops up over apps as a Facebook Messenger-like chat head. It’s better than expected, but it’s not a reason to buy the phone.. With a battery capacity of 3,000mAh — the same size as the battery in the Galaxy S8 — we expected standard day-long performance, but we’ve been pleasantly surprised. The HTC U11 has no trouble lasting past bedtime, even with heavy use.. Much depends on which apps and games you use, signal strength in your area, and a few other factors, but the U11 seems to have good battery life. On average, it lasts more than a day — we ended a day of average use with about 40 percent remaining.. Speaking of charging, the U11 supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 technology. It juices up fast when the battery is low, but then slows down as it approaches capacity. To give an example, this morning it took half an hour to go from 22 percent to 69 percent, but another hour to reach 100 percent.. We’re a little disappointed that there’s no support for wireless charging, like you’ll find in the S8.. Everyone wants a great camera in their smartphone, but it has not been a strong point for HTC over the last few years. That may all be about to change with the U11. This is an excellent camera that gets consistently good results in a variety of different environments and conditions. We’ve really enjoyed our time with it so far.. Early indications that HTC might have got the camera right came from news that DxO Mark awarded it a score of 90, the highest score it has ever given a smartphone camera. For reference, the Google Pixel scored 89, the Galaxy S8 scored 88. and the iPhone 7 scored 86.. The HTC U11 has a 12-megapixel main camera with a large f/1.7 aperture, with Optical Image Stabilization, a dual LED flash, and HDR Boost. Photographers will appreciate the Pro mode with RAW format support.. During our testing in auto mode, we found quickly pointing and shooting with the U11 camera resulted in pleasingly great shots more often than not. It’s very fast to focus, captures a real depth of detail with very little noise, and the colors are vibrant, but realistic.. In sunny conditions, most photos turned out great, and low-light performance is equally impressive. There’s inevitably some blooming with bright lights, but the U11 compares favorably with other smartphone cameras. It’s great for close-ups, too, capturing microscopic details with a solid bokeh effect blurring the background.. The front-facing camera is rated at 16 megapixels with an f/2.0 aperture, HDR Boost support, and 1080p video recording. It’s ideal for video calls and capable of capturing detailed selfies, although we preferred the results when we used the squeeze function to snap selfies with the main camera.. We were glad to find BoomSound speakers in the HTC U11, though the main speaker is bottom facing — we occasionally had to readjust our fingers to avoid covering it up. The volume and quality is good — for a phone – in fact, it’s one of the loudest phones we’ve ever tested. Call quality and clarity is also solid.. The U11 comes with a pair of fairly comfortable USonic earphones with active noise cancellation in the box with your U11. We were really impressed with the noise cancellation. When music plays, it drowns out the vast majority of background sound from your environment. Movies and TV shows are a lot more immersive with the earphones, too.. We’re conflicted on the HTC U11 design. The liquid glass finish is gorgeous and the build quality is generally high, but fingerprint smudges quickly spoil it. The U11 also feels big, with an average display that has too much border around it.. Under the hood, the U11 offers unsurpassed speed and fluidity. The camera is one of the best we’ve used, the audio quality is above average, and we’re satisfied with the battery life. Squeezability is in its infancy, but it’s useful at times and points the way to a possible button-free future.. You can order the HTC U11 unlocked from HTC or Amazon for $650, or pick it up from Sprint on a two-year contract at $29 per month.. It’s now shipping to customers in the United States. In the U.K., it’s also sold through HTC’s own online store , through the EE network, or Carphone Warehouse for 650 British pounds.. There are four available colors: black, silver grey, blue, and red. The stunning solar red — the liquid glass surface switches from red to orange depending on the light — is our particular favorite, and the excellent news is it can be purchased in both the U.S and the United Kingdom.. The HTC U11 comes with a standard limited 2-year warranty that covers manufacturing defects and faulty parts or components, but not accidents. The phone is IP67-rated, which is good because you’re not covered for water damage. Sadly, the U11 is not covered by HTC’s Uh-Oh Protection, which offers a free replacement for cracked screens or water damage when you buy your phone directly from HTC.. HTC is also currently running a limited-time promotion for U.S. subscribers through the end of September. If you purchase an HTC 11, you’ll receive three months of Amazon Music Unlimited for free.. The most popular Android smartphone right now is the Samsung Galaxy S8. and there’s little doubt it outclasses the U11 in the style department, but it will cost you at least $100 more. The identically priced LG G6. It’s not as powerful as the U11, but it has a great wide-angle lens and that new 18:9 screen format.. offers Snapdragon 835 power for a lower $480 price, then throws in up to 8GB of RAM for good measure, along with a capable dual-lens camera. The design is attractive, but the color choice is dull compared to the eye-catching HTC U11.. The HTC U11 should comfortably last you two years, maybe three. It has the latest flavor of Android with Google Assistant onboard, and HTC’s president of smartphones, Chialin Chang, has confirmed that the handset will be updated with at least the next two major Android versions.. It also has the cutting-edge Snapdragon 835 inside, which is Qualcomm’s top chip right now. Based on our testing the U11 is powerful enough to satisfy your every whim for the foreseeable future.. If you value substance over style, the HTC U11 is easy to recommend. It’s lightning fast, it delivers compelling audio quality, the camera gets excellent results with no fiddling required, and the battery life is solid. Sense Companion complements Google Assistant and Alexa nicely, and Edge Sense is the innovative cherry on top.. Update: We added details about the extended Edge Sense functionality..

CNET también está disponible en español.. The HTC U11 lets you take photos just by squeezing it (hands-on). Pressure-sensitive sides will launch an app when you grasp the phone.. by May 16, 2017 12:00 AM PDT. HTC U11 is the first phone you can squeeze. Gorgeous glass design, advanced processor and everything else. There's no headset jack, so you'll need to plug the included earbuds into the USB-C port. HTC includes an adapter if you prefer to use your own headphones. Amazon Alexa assistant will launch with a wake word. (HTC will add this about a month after the U11 goes on sale.) Audio quality so far seems loud, clear and rich. The Edge Sense squeeze feature is pressure sensitive and will work underwater and through some cases. HTC will also make a model in solar red (expect it to sell in select regions). HTC U11 specs versus Galaxy S8, iPhone 7 Plus, LG G6. Want to launch the camera on the HTC U11? Just squeeze.. When the phone's pressure-sensitive sides register your tightened grip, it'll open the app you've programmed in.. Say you've squeezed the camera app open. You can squeeze again to take a picture. A long squeeze might open and close the flashlight, or toggle Wi-Fi or a voice recording. Or another app of your choice.. What's going on is an entirely new way to interact with a phone. Called Edge Sense, this feature marks the first time any phonemaker has used touch like this. For HTC, a company that has itself felt the squeeze from larger rivals such as Samsung, Apple and LG, the U11's grippy new feature presents an opportunity to step out of others' shadows with an industry first.. Giving a phone pressure-sensitive sides is an incredibly interesting innovation, and one that raises a lot of questions: is this a natural way to open shortcuts, or is it better suited to some other task? Will it be accurate or will mispresses abound? Is it a useless gimmick, or the start of exciting things to come?. I don't have an answer to that yet, but after my brief time with the phone, I did try out many of the launch options, and I like that an animation of squeezed-in sides lets you know the feature's working. I found the motion easy to execute, but I did sometimes long-squeeze when I meant to short-squeeze.. I think muscle memory will take care of that down the road. I also think this method of app-launching would only be useful for the apps I open all the time (which takes that voice recorder out of the running).. The bigger question for HTC is if the U11's fresh look and feel, and high end specs are enough to make a dent in Samsung and Apple's overwhelming lead -- squeeze feature or no. From what I've seen of the U11 so far, its premium hardware stands the best chance of any HTC phone in quite awhile.. The rest will come down to performance, and how well HTC can gets its phone in front of buyers.. In the US, the HTC U11 sells for $649 -- you'll be able to pick it up in sapphire blue, amazing silver and brilliant black. Buy the unlocked version from htc.com , and AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon carrier versions from Amazon. The phone will arrive on your doorstep in June.. You'll also be able to buy the blue and black HTC U11 from Sprint. The phone goes on sale June 9, but early preorders will also get you two Amazon Echo ( $185.99 at Overstock.com ) Dot ( $29.95 at Amazon.com ) speakers. It'll cost $0 down and$29 per month for 24 months, for a grand total of $696.. It's too soon to say how the U11 performs compares to the Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ) and LG G6 , and if buyers connect with its glass design and squeeze effects.. The Big Squeeze sure is attention-grabbing, but it's really one small feature in what's shaping up to be a pretty good package.. The blue half-moons show it's working.. You get a 5.5-inch display with a QHD, or 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution (same as the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6), so there's plenty of screen to interact with.. The U11 refines the gorgeous "melted" glass design of the U Ultra ( $328.98 at Amazon.com ). It really does look like pools of liquid. It's also highly reflective and smudges up quickly. The phone meets a water-resistant rating of IP67, which helps keep water away for up to 30 minutes and 3 feet (1 meter).. I like that the 12-megapixel rear camera sits flush on the design; it's good that the lens doesn't poke out. If you follow camera specs, the U11 uses dual-pixel autofocus technology rather than laser autofocus (this should help it focus faster), and has an aperture of f1.7 (versus f1.8 on the HTC 10 ( $384.99 at Amazon.com ) ).. Your front-facing camera is a 16-megapixel wide-angle lens (150 degrees). Camera images seemed completely usable in my quick tests, but I didn't have the time to really dig deep into setting or image quality.. Other things to know going in:. 5.86 x 2.68 x 0.32 in..

Jaime Rivera June 26, 2017 2:42 am. At a time when taller displays are becoming popular, HTC decided to approach things in a more conventional way, even if with a couple of new tricks that are unique. Qualcomm MSM8998 Snapdragon 835 Octa-core (4x2.45 GHz Kryo & 4x1.9 GHz Kryo) Adreno 540. Super LCD5 capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors 5.5 inches (~71.4% screen-to-body ratio) 1440 x 2560 pixels (~534 ppi pixel density). 64 or 128GB of Storage Expandable via microSD. Primary: 12 MP, f/1.7, phase detection autofocus, OIS FFC: 16 MP, f/2.0, 1080p. Hardware Software Camera Performance Pricing and Availability Conclusion Related Videos. The argument in 2016 is that smartphones were getting boring, and one of the companies that used this as the main purpose for its then flagship was HTC. We can’t really say that the HTC 10 addressed any of the boredom that HTC claimed, but one thing it did do is prove that HTC was back. The company we once admired for making great smartphones made a solid comeback with that device.. Now, 2017 is a very interesting year for flagships. We have companies experimenting with taller displays and new aspect ratios, and we’re one digital assistant short of forming a basketball team. Yes, we need flagships to continue pushing the bar of innovation, but like with every new thing, it’s clear that some of these features are still solutions in search of a problem.. As a result, and given the price hike of some of these devices, some people actually don’t like anything about this new approach. Be it cool or not, some people just want a conventional flagship that’s powerful, capable, and beautiful enough. If you’re looking for a more conventional approach, there’s pretty much just one flagship this year that does address some of the problems already in need of a solution, but in ways that are actually not conventional. We’re talking about the HTC U11, and it’s time for our full review.. The HTC U11 is a very interesting approach to hardware design. Notice I didn’t begin this review giving you the typical sob story of how bad things are for HTC, or how the HTC U Ultra didn’t really do more than become a source for mockery.. Actually, the U11 is a very different animal. More the result of a company that has matured in many ways over the years. Just set this phone on its front over a table, and you’ll understand what I’m talking about. This phone is gorgeous, eye catching, and an immediate call for admiration. This 3D formed glass finish that HTC is dubbing liquid design is a very different approach to curving glass. Instead of making it about adding features, the whole purpose is to make this rather large phone feel pleasant in the hand, and that it definitely is.. The curves extend to the glass front, leading to this pebble-like shape that’s easily noticeable. I also love that HTC chose to stick to a black finish at the front, regardless of what color option you pick. I find black bezels to be more immersive for content consumption. The company decided to wait on the whole trend of 18.5:9 displays, and you know what, I’m not going to complain. As it stands pillar boxing is what I hate most about competing devices. There is still a good list of apps that’s not ready to support new aspect ratios, and whatever more pixels you would’ve gained are compensated by the dedicated capacitive buttons on the U11.. This is a Quad HD Super LCD 5 with punchy color and decent blacks. It does get very bright, up to the point of offering good visibility in direct sunlight, even if you’re wearing polarized sunglasses. The only problem is that oddly, if you launch the camera while wearing polarized lenses, you have to view the display from an angle for the UI to be visible. About my only complaint is the size of these bezels, leading to a 71% screen to body ratio, at a time when competitors that stick to 16:9 like the OnePlus 5 give you a solid 73%.. Precautions that I would recommend with this phone is not setting it on its front over a table as the curves seem notorious to minor scratches from dirt, and also be ready to clean this phone constantly, as the reflective coating in the back really loves fingerprints and smudges.. Tucked inside the shell we have almost everything a flagship needs. Snapdragon 835, 4 gigs of RAM, 64 gigs of expandable storage, and my review unit includes the bonus of dual-SIM capabilities if I ditch the microSD. We also get IP67 water and dust resistance, another crucial feature you should look up to in 2017.. HTC Sense makes a return to power all the hardware of the U11. This is a combination of HTC design, and a commitment with Google to avoid bloat. As a result, there’s just one Calendar, one Calculator, Google Photos supersedes the Gallery, and so on and so forth. The result is a phone that manages RAM far better than competitors, and all leading to zippy performance all around.. Graphics intensive games launch quickly and work like a charm. Even this proprietary launcher and services like BlinkFeed work without a stutter, something devices like the Galaxy S8 fumble with in the basics.. The HTC Sense Companion finally started working for me, but the implementation still feels hit or miss. One day it noticed I had an early appointment and suggested I set an alarm in the morning, something I honestly appreciated. The only problem is that every other time, all it does is tell me I use my phone too much… like really?. HTC’s Edge Sense is one of those new features that I’ve come to love and hate. I seriously love the simplicity of squeezing lightly to get the Google Feed, as OEMs continue to ignore it, or the long squeeze to launch the flashlight. I still consider this hidden button to be genius. The problem if you set the sensitivity to light, you’ll find the phone activating the feature when you don’t want it to, and going the opposite direction makes the gesture feel awkward on borders this thin. You can always just switch this off. It’s a nice little convenience, but I honestly don’t see the point in going through all this trouble instead of simply adding another button.. The camera experience on the HTC U11 only gets better if you compare it to its predecessor. DxOMark claims this to be the best camera of 2017, and even if I won’t go as far as to call this my favorite, it does a great job.. I love the color saturation and detail provided during the day, and at night it shines as a solid performer. Even with the Ultra Pixels being reduced to 1.4 microns, the bump in aperture does compensate. Juan’s real camera review should shed some more light on our final verdict for how this camera competes.. I love features like the 3D audio recording for video, making the experience more immersive as the camera captures audio from the direction of the source.. My only complaints are the death of stabilization on the front facing shooter, and how it also stepped back the Ultra Pixel hardware approach brought by the U Ultra.. I’ve been using the HTC U11 for nearly two weeks between New York City and Honduras. There are things in which this phone is great, and others where it’s simply the expected performance of a flagship. For example, this phone has proven to be a champ in retaining to Wi-Fi and Cellular signal, even when compared to other 2017 flagships. Oddly I feel that call quality over the ear piece has gotten slightly tinier compared to the HTC 10, even if the speakers have gotten louder. As of the moment of this review this is the only 2017 flagship with dual-firing speakers, but more on that in Juan’s Real Audio Review.. My biggest problem with Audio is the death of the headphone jack. Yes HTC, all 2017 flagships have one, except the U11. This feels like the time when HTC kept insisting that 4 Ultra Pixels was all you needed in a smartphone camera. Minimalism in design makes sense, but not in features. Yes, I do get the point of HTC U Sonic, and yes, I love the acoustic noise cancellation that can only be provided by having these headphones draw power from the phone and use the four microphones. It’s not as great as on my PXC 550s, but far better than any headphones I’ve tested that came bundled in the box. The problem is the need to be carrying this specific dongle everywhere else, since like with all the current cases of phones requiring them, these are proprietary, meaning the dongle on a Moto Z won’t work on this phone. Why does this matter so much? Well if OEMs gave us two USB-C ports, that would be awesome, but try to charge this phone on a long flight while listening to music. And then you’ll stay that there is amazing fast charging on this phone, and that the battery is amazing. Sadly, charging your phone is something you’ll be doing quite often. I had very high hopes for the optimizations on Android 7.1.1, but as it stands, the 3000mAh power pack on the U11 is just average, barely scratching to the end of day of moderate use.. We received a lot of heat in our video review given the “awake” indication on our battery stats. As it stands, our experience has been the same with or without this “awake” indication being shown as you’ll see in the screen shots, and remember this review is focused on consumers, so hacking anything to fix that isn’t something we can discuss as part of this review.. As of the time of this review, only Sprint had picked up the HTC U11. Every other carrier requires you to buy the unlocked variant, and yes, this even includes Verizon. At $649, this is definitely not an affordable device, but if you think of the fact that you’re getting a lot more bang for your buck than paying that same amount of money for a 32GB iPhone 7, and yes, the small iPhone 7, then you’ll understand why we don’t complain about the price tag at all.. To conclude, there’s a lot to like about the HTC U11. This is gorgeous hardware, matched by up to date specs, and with a set of unique features like U Sonic, and Edge Sense, that help this phone stand apart from the standard set of competitors out there.. I’d even say that my experience using the U11 has been delightful enough for me not to miss devices like the Galaxy S8 or the LG G6. The only reason why I’ve ended up drifting back to these other devices is because I wish HTC and other OEMs would stop copying Apple in the things they shouldn’t. Removing the 3.5mm headphone jack is not innovation, nor courage. If anything it’s lack of ingenuity in solving a problem. The day Bluetooth grows up to support better quality audio, and the day OEMs agree on a solution to avoid proprietary dongles, and also the day smartphones can last more than a day on a charge, then I’d say it’s time to move on. Sadly as it stands, proprietary solutions are always an exercise in frustration in the long run.. Even with its short comings, I have no problem in recommending the HTC U11. This is definitely a great phone in absolutely everything else. The question is if you’d be willing to give HTC another chance? Make sure you share your final thoughts in the comments down below.. + Great build quality + Liquid design shows new ways to curve glass + Hardware buttons provide more screen real-estate + Great camera + HTC U Sonic provides great audio and ANC out of the box + IP67 water and dust resistant + Powerful specs. - Battery size and performance don't impress - Fingerprint magnet - Substantial bezels - No headphone jack and only proprietary USB-C headphones work. The HTC U11 is a great smartphone. Definitely a worthy successor to the HTC 10, and good enough to make us forget about the U Ultra. This is finally an HTC flagship that doesn't fall behind in features, even if ditching essentials like a headphone jack have been met with polarization.. Android , Phones , Reviews.
