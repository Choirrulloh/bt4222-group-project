Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Night mode, Effects.

The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Octa-core, 1600 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 14 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 21.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Victor Hristov. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) is the successor to one of the more popular cheap phones out there: the J5 (2016). And while it retains the form factor and some key specs — an equally-sized 5.2-inch HD display and just 16 GB of on board storage — it gets rid of the plastic build in favor of a sturdier, metal design and it adds essential features like a fingerprint scanner. With its minimal side bezel, it even looks fairly modern. But what is the experience of using an affordable Android phone like the Galaxy J5 (2017) and is it worth getting one? Let’s find out. In the box: Phone White earbuds with in-line mic microUSB cable Wall charger SIM cjection tool User manual Design Sturdy and solid, but far from pretty. The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) is made out of metal and feels reassuringly solid in terms of build quality. At 0.31 inches (7.9mm) of thickness it is neither too thin, nor too thick, and the curved edges and slight curve on the back make it fit comfortably in the hand. The most notable design element are the antennas on the back that extend like two halves of a curved rectangle, a look unlike that on any other phone. This is particularly noticeable on the pink and gold J5 (2017) models, where the antenna bands contrast more with the color of the phone, while on the black and blue models, the antenna lines are barely noticeable. There is a single camera on the back, flush with the body of the phone. The other notable thing about the new J5 is that it has its speaker neither at the bottom, nor at the back, but on the right side of the phone (just like the Samsung A series from this year). This is actually not a bad place for the speaker: you're less likely to accidentally cover it with your hand. The buttons are made of metal and feel clicky and responsive. There is now a fingerprint scanner embedded in the home key on the front. It’s definitely not among the fastest ones, but it is fairly accurate. On the bottom, you’d find the microphone, a microUSB port for charging (no USB-C here, unfortunately), and a 3.5mm audio jack. The J5 (2017) lacks any form of special water protection or other super-powers, in case you were wondering. Display A 5.2” AMOLED display with an HD resolution in 2017 is a bit sad. The Galaxy J5 (2017) features a 5.2-inch Super AMOLED display with a 720 x 1280 pixel, HD resolution. The display is properly laminated and features oleophobic coating, which might be a standard on pricier phones, but is not as common on affordable phones, so it’s nice that the J5 (2017) has this. What is not so great is the resolution: it’s just low for today’s standards, even for an affordable phone. In practical terms, this means that you see some pixelization, especially noticeable when you read text. Colors are set by default to a punchy, slightly oversaturated mode (“Adaptive display”) that most users really like. You can go into Settings > Display > Screen Mode, and choose a different one, with more toned-down, neutral colors. If you want to get slightly better accuracy out of the default Adaptive Display mode,, go into the Color Balance section and reduce the green and blue colors a couple of steps. The J5 (2017) is also bright enough to be fairly legible even under direct sunlight which is nice. The phone also offers a blue light filter, which reduces the blue light emitted from your phone. This should help you fall asleep easier if you use your phone at night, as the blue light from the screen could mess up your sleeping cycle.. The speaker and the power button. 5.76 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches. 146.3 x 71.3 x 7.9 mm. 5.74 x 2.85 x 0.32 inches. 145.8 x 72.3 x 8.1 mm. 5.75 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches. 146.1 x 71.4 x 7.9 mm. 5.91 x 2.91 x 0.38 inches. 150.2 x 74 x 9.7 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) Compare.

In Canada it's $580 for that tiny fart of an iPhone SE. Although many places are offering BOGO deals, buy an iPhone 6s or 7 and get a free iPhone SE. But nowadays we are seeing buy an iPhone 7 and get a free iPhone 7 as well. I guess Apple has to get there market share up any way they can.

It’s packed with great Samsung features, and boasts two 13MP cameras.". “Samsung’s Galaxy J5 is back for another year - now featuring a full metal jacket, and still at a great price.”. Last year’s Galaxy J5 (2016) may have had a sturdy metal boarder, but this year’s model is protected all-round. The slimline design looks and feels great, with the rear camera sitting completely flush against the smooth metal.. At 5.2-inches, the J5’s HD screen provides plenty of space for doing more than one thing at once. And it’ll fair well against life’s occasional bumps and scrapes, with Gorilla Glass protection as standard.. Find out more about the two 13MP cameras. The main 13MP camera will deliver high quality photos every time, with a huge f/1.7 aperture. The lower the aperture number, the wider the lens can open - letting more light inside the camera. And more light means clearer, more accurate pictures.. Front-facing lenses aren’t generally as powerful that the main smartphone cameras, but that’s not the case with the J5 (2017). At 13MP, it’s neck and neck – and that means super sharp selfies and crystal-clear video calls every time.. What makes the J5 (2017) go?. A massive 3,000mAh battery will make sure you’re never without power. If you do find yourself running low, however, Samsung’s Ultra Power Saving mode will step in to save the day.. Your favourite apps and games will all run smoothly with the J5 (2017)’s 1.6GHz octa-core processor running the show. And there’s 2GB RAM on board for good measure too.. 146.2 x 71.3 x 7.9 mm.

I bought one new about 8 months ago, never dropped it or anything. I've always been good with electronics, computers, phones, etc so I know when I have a problem with a device, it's the device, not me. I don't know if it was the Android 7 update or just a faulty phone but I can't seem to do anything right on this piece of garbage phone. The screen turns on randomly even when I'm not touching it. Google chrome will not stop refreshing for no reason. Spotify and other music apps stop playing music for no reason. Everything is glitchy and just doesn't work right. Tried factory restoring and that didn't help. Seems to have a problem with literally everything you tell it to do.. Was this review helpful?

Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) review: a change of face and price. Which Samsung smartphones should you buy?. Samsung Galaxy J7 (2017) review: a pleasant surprise. Samsung's Galaxy J line is quite popular among users who are looking for a brand device that's not too expensive. The J5 (2017) exhibits new materials and design compared to the previous generation. But how does it go about it in terms of performance? Let's find out.. ✓ Quality of materials and assembly. ✕ MicroUSB instead of Type C. Lowest price: Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017). Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) release date and price. The 2017 generation of the J5 is sold in the US as the Samsung Galaxy J5 Pro (2017). available from Amazon for $204 in black, gold, blue and pink.. from Samsung UK's website for. in black and gold, under the name Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017). There is only one model with 2 GB of RAM. internal memory, expandable via microSD up to 256 GB.. Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) design and build quality. The J5 2017 is made of metal. Back and multitasking keys are not backlit. Support for microSD and Dual SIM. MicroUSB port and mini jack for the cuffie. The navigation keys are not backlit. Don't expect the same design, use of materials and build quality as the previous generation because Samsung has decided to improve the Galaxy J5 (2017). The smartphone abandons the plastic in favor of a body of 146.2 x 71.3 x 8 mm and 160 grams made entirely of metal.. The design is not original, but you should appreciate the upgrade of the materials used and the good assembly. The J5 thus adopts a classic Samsung look, rounded corners, logo on the opaque case and above the display, power button on the right and volume control on the left.. To insert SIM and microSD you will need to use the trays on the left edge, which can be pulled out with the pin included in the purchase box. The model I tested is the dual SIM version: the smallest slot is dedicated to the main SIM card, while the largest slot is dedicated to the second SIM card and microSD card.. On the body you can see the thin black stripes of the antennas and the non-protuding. camera section highlighted by the silvery frame. On the front you'll find the clickable home. button that also acts as a fingerprint reader, also present in the J7 but omitted in the J3. Alongside the reader are the back and multitasking keys, but they are not backlit, a shame. The notification LED is also absent.. The Galaxy J5 (2017) houses the speaker laterally on the right (as on the A series), while along the lower edge it leaves room for the headphone mini jack and miniUSB port (no Type C). The keys are all easily reachable, are solid and respond to commands. The smartphone guarantees good ergonomics and does not slip even when resting on flat surfaces. The general look is similar to that of the Galaxy A5 (2017) but forget the certification against water and dust.. Included in the purchase package is the 1.55 A charger, the microUSB charging cable and a pair of headphones with microphone.. 5.2 inch HD display in pleasantly bright HD. The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) mounts a 5.2-inch Super AMOLED screen and thus sits between the 5.5-inch J7. The resolution is 720 x 1280 pixels in 282 ppi. The screen is pleasantly bright and can be read even in sunlight. From the settings you can set the brightness automatically and the brightness sensor does its job.. The colors are bright, those typical of Samsung.. From the dedicated menu you can balance colors to change the appearance of white tones, choose one of the four screen modes (Adctive, AMOLED Cinema, AMOLED Photos, Basic) and activate the blue light filter so you don't strain your eyes too hard during your nocturnal readings.. Double Messenger (Settings>Advanced Functions) lets you create a second account for apps like Facebook and Skype.. Android 7.0 Nougat and Samsung Experience 8.1 on the Galaxy J5 2017. The Galaxy J5 (2017), like its siblings, runs Android 7.0 Nougat. Samsung could not opt for the latest version of the software, but at least we find Samsung Experience in version 8.1. Security patches are stationary until June.. The interface is fluid and pleasant to use but don't expect a chip. The app drawer is accessible with a swipe upwards, but you need a side swipe to scroll between apps. Bloatware is limited to brand apps, Google, Upday for news management and the Microsoft app package. Pre-installed apps cannot be uninstalled but disabled by pressing and holding for a few seconds.. Like the Galaxy A, you can enjoy Game Launcher and secure your content in Personal Area. The possibility to customize the color of the folders with a simple tap. With a side swipe on the unlock screen you can manage the songs you are listening to. I was surprised to find the Dual Messenger (Settings>Advanced Functions) that allows you to create a second account for apps like Facebook and Skype just like with the Twin App on. 16GB of internal memory isn't much. but with the use of microSD you won't have any space problems. Apps open a little bit slowly. It's a smartphone that isn't designed for intensive multitasking or gamers. 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.1. 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.0. 3D Mark Ice Storm Unlimited ES 2.0. The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) incorporates an Exynos 7870 octa-core 1.6GHz processor flanked by the Mali T830MP2 GPU T830MP2 graphics drive, 2GB RAM and 16GB ROM. Performance is good for a processor and device of this range. This means that in everyday use, such as managing emails, calling, swiping, scrolling through Facebook, web searches and videos, you won't have any problems.. The fingerprint reader is not one of the fastest but during my test it did not make a mistake. I found it convenient, as on the A5, the speaker placed on the right during the playback of videos or games less demanding. The NFC is present but, compared to the A series, there is no Always On that you can still have by downloading a dedicated app from the Play Store.. The speaker is located on the right, at the top. The Galaxy J5 has a single speaker placed on the right that doesn't disappoint in terms of audio experience but doesn't work miracles. I found the maximum volume a bit low but, moreover, it's not a smartphone designed for multimedia and during calls you won't have any problems with volume or reception.. Accessing the Audio Quality and Effects submenu you can put your hand on the equalizer to handle bass and treble, allowing you to customize the audio to your preferences. A basic Pro mode and real-time effects. Gallery of photos taken with the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017). The Galaxy J5 features a 13MP camera in front and rear. The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) improves in the photographic sector compared to the previous generation: there are two 13MP cameras (S Sony IMX258 sensor) with f/1.7 on the back and f/1.9 on the front. Alongside the LED flash this provides good shots when the light is good. When light conditions deteriorate, the results are affected. Considering the range of the J line, the results are good.. With a swipe from right to left you can access real-time effects, a nice feature for those who like to share their shots on social platforms, including basic Pro mode that allows you to customize some parameters such as ISO and white balance. The selfie quality is good and the colors are close to the real ones. With the Galaxy J5 (2017) you can shoot 1080p videos.. In our PC test Mark the Galaxy J5 (2017) reached 9 hours and 9 minutes.. The 3000 mAh battery is one of the strengths of this smartphone. HD screen, it can guarantee an average of one and a half days with standard use of the device that reaches up to two if limited to calls, whatsapp and a few Facebook checks.. In our PC Mark test, the Galaxy J5 (2017) reached 9 hours and 9 minutes. If you're looking for a better performing device, you can stay with your family and focus on the cheaper J3 that has achieved a 12 hour 33 minute result. Unfortunately, the J5 relies on the almost outdated microUSB port for charging. Charging your smartphone completely takes about 2 hours.. Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) technical specifications. 146.2 x 71.3 x 8 mm. 1280 x 720 pixels (282 ppi). HSPA, LTE, NFC, Dual-SIM , Bluetooth 4.1. The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) offers a more elegant design than the previous generation and houses the fingerprint reader. Overall it is an improved version, able to satisfy less demanding users. (gamers stay away from this device). Good battery life guaranteed and nice shots in good lighting conditions; even more surprisingly, the selfie is surprising.. I don't understand why Samsung has decided to discard the notification LED and I understand the list price even less, as it's difficult to digest for a low end smartphone. On the hardware and software side, there's nothing mind-blowing. and if you find it online for less than $250 (it's only $204 on Amazon right now), it's worth thinking about it, hoping that with prolonged use it doesn't slow down. If you find it for over $250 online, it doesn't quite have enough to justify its cost over alternatives such as the. Moto G5 Plus or Huawei P10 Lite.. If you can, get the J530Y with 3GB RAM and 32GB of storage. I imported this device into the UK and am very happy with it. If I have a criticism it's that the call quality is a bit average, almost as if the audio has been a bit bandwidth limited. Other than that it's great for the money.. On the specs it's no bargain at the price, where Moto G5 offers 32gb on a good device, for the same money (and on big Xmas discount now). Samsung is increasingly trying to build an "ecosystem" (e.g. Bixby) and is generally more intrusive about bloatware than I like at this price point, where the closer to clean Android the better..

Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) key features:. Screen: 5.2" 720p Super AMOLED screen (282ppi). OS: Android 7.0 Nougat; Samsung UX. Chipset: Exynos 7870, 14nm: octa-core 1.6GHz Cortex-A53 CPU, Mali-T830MP2 GPU. Memory: 2/3GB of RAM; 16/32GB storage, dedicated microSD slot for expansion. Camera: Primary 13MP, f/1.7, LED flash; Secondary 13MP, f/1.9, LED flash. Connectivity: nano SIM (dual SIM version available); LTE (Cat. 6); dual-band Wi-Fi ac; Bluetooth 4.2; FM Radio; microUSB; 3.5mm jack. Misc: Fingerprint reader, Samsung Pay. Low base storage for the global version at 16GB. Segmentation is at its finest in the Samsung smartphone lineup. That's how we have the entire alphabet of series with a handful of models in each of them. Near the bottom of the food chain - which is in no way sorted alphabetically - the hugely successful J series is the place to get good value for money, and the Galaxy J5 (2017) is ready to oblige.. At 5.2 inches of screen diagonal, the Galaxy J5 (2017) fits between the 5-inch J3 (2017) and the 5.5-inch J7 (2017). From then on it takes some careful balancing between those two extremes to assemble a J5 that is that much better than the J3 without being as good as the J7. Perhaps most importantly, the J5 for this year gets the Exynos 7870 SoC - a proper 14nm chip with an octa-core CPU, as opposed to the quad-core Snapdragon 410 that powers the J5 (2016).. With only the J7 treated to full-HD, the J5 has a 720p screen - which is acceptable considering the smaller diagonal. Plus, the J7 (2016)'s sales figures didn't seem to be hurt by its own 720p display, a 5.5-inch diagonal there, not to mention that the Mali-T830MP2 GPU appreciates the lower load of fewer pixels. There's no always-on display on the J5, unlike the J7, and that's a bit of a waste of AMOLED.. The J7 (2017) comes with 3GB of RAM in all its incarnations, but the J5 only has 2 gigs, except for a Pro version that matches the big bro. Storage is less than generous too, with the international version getting just 16GB, though it's double that in some regions - remember, segmentation.. The cameras come from the J7, and not the J3, which is good, even if we weren't ecstatic about the J7's output. The overall body design is identical to the larger model's, which makes the J3 look like a member of a different family. Additionally, you do get a fingerprint reader with the J5 (2017); the basic J3 is denied that.. There's no denying the usefulness of a dedicated microSD slot, and we've got nothing but praise for Samsung for going this route with the J-series. That said, it's no substitute for decent internal storage. The lack of quick charging is a nuisance but hardly a deal-breaker, and while microUSB is yesterday's interface, at least you'll probably have a use of legacy chargers and cables..

Home / News / Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) review: A milestone for the masses. Galaxy J5 (2017) review: design Display Camera Software Performance Audio quality Battery life Fingerprint reader, other features Conclusion Pros Cons Solid metal design Screen resolution could be higher Good looking display No more exchangeable battery Two-day battery life No LED notification Full of useful features Micro-USB connector Fast fingerprint reader Good selfie camera. It was not all that long ago that Samsung was chronically criticized for putting too many plastic parts on expensive phones. Now, in 2017, things are entirely different. Of course, a few markets already saw affordable premium devices last year , but for many consumers, the new Galaxy J (2017) series presents that which seemed impossible only a few years ago. In this Galaxy J5 (2017) review, I’ll be looking thoroughly at the first of these devices to hit markets in Europe, Latin America, and Asia.. Jumping straight into the design of the Galaxy J5 (2017), it is easy to understand why I am stoked. In many markets, this will be one of Samsung’s entry-level smartphones, and it easily surpasses recent flagship devices like the Galaxy S6 , perhaps even the Galaxy S7 , in build quality.. Thanks to its moderate 5.2-inch display and slightly thinner bezels, the Galaxy J5 (2017) is much nicer to handle than its predecessor. Just like, for example, on the Galaxy A3 (2017) , the speaker is now found on the side, just above the power key. The metal back is quite prone to scratches but no fingerprint magnet.. Overall, the Galaxy J5 (2017) is just a very well-built device, and I would prefer it over the Galaxy A5 (2017) if it had any type of IP-certification. It, however, does not, as Samsung obviously must keep some differentiation between it Galaxy J and A lineup. I am guessing the decision to include a micro-USB connector instead of a type-C one is backed by similar logic, or Samsung simply had another few million of those lying around. This was, apparently, not the case with the notification LED, as the phone is not equipped with one, despite it being available on last year’s Galaxy J7 Prime for the Indian market.. Either way, the phone feels very much nicer in my hand than the price tag suggests. And that is something I have never said about any of Samsung’s non-flagship devices until now.. As expected, the Galaxy J5 (2017) packs a 5.2-inch AMOLED display. While its contrast and color reproduction are as good as can be expected, the 720p HD resolution isn’t quite 2017. If your eyes are good, you can see individual pixels, thanks to the display’s PenTile subpixel layout.. There are several devices in the same price range, or cheaper, that have a 1080p Full HD panel. These phones, however, usually have a TFT LCD display, with lower contrast and less lively colors. If you’re in the market for a phone in this class, your choice boils down to this: higher resolution or prettier colors. The Galaxy J5 (2017) offers the latter, not the former.. Samsung, in some of the J5’s marketing materials, refers to the display as a 2.5D-display. And indeed, the panel lies ever so slightly above the metal rim surrounding it. However, compared to any other 2.5D display used by Samsung (S7, A series), this display should probably be called 2.2D, if that were a thing. The visual effect just isn’t that obvious.. Overall, I will say the Galaxy J5 (2017) packs a pretty nice display, even if it could have been sharper. The lower resolution sure is friendlier on the battery (more on that later). And although you have to wait a bit for our full review of the Galaxy J7 (2017) , I can give you one little spoiler: the Exynos 7870 SoC used in both the J5 and J7 handles 720p a lot better than 1080p.. In this review so far, the Galaxy J5 (2017) was off to a flying start when I described the phone’s design. The display, though more than satisfactory, gave fewer reasons for outright enthusiasm, and this line continues with the cameras. Though fine for your average ‘let-me-quickly-snap-a-pic-to-post-somewhere’ scenario, they’re just not very good. In recent years, Samsung has become so good at providing a mind-blowing camera experience in its high-end smartphones, but there’s none of that if you don’t shell out S8-like cash. In other words: the J5 (2017)’s cameras are very basic. There’s no optical image stabilization, no real time HDR mode, and unlike the A series, you can’t even download additional camera features.. The lack of stabilization particularly comes into play because there is no real time HDR mode. The non-real time HDR ‘Rich Tone’ setting is so slow, it is near-impossible to hold the phone still enough for as long as it takes to capture the image. Without the HDR mode, dynamic range is limited, so pictures often turn out too bright or too dark.. Colors are a bit of a hit and miss affair too. Sometimes the rather dull looking tones are actually closer to reality than some other devices that turn out oversaturated colors. However, at other times, the Galaxy J5 (2017)’s colors really are duller than reality. That said, auto focus is mostly pretty fast and accurate, which is a very important quality for users who just want to point their phone and take a picture – in other words, most users, particularly ones shopping in this price range. And, especially in the light of earlier J devices, low-light shooting has improved considerably. I’m even inclined to say it performs better in the dark than, for example, the Galaxy A5 (2017), no doubt thanks to the faster autofocus and the reduced aperture (f/1.7 on the J5 vs f/1.9 on the A5).. As has become a stable in the J series, the Galaxy J5 (2017) has a front cam (now 13 megapixels, just like the rear sensor) with a LED flash. And though I’m still not one to take a selfie more than, say, once a decade, I see the point of that flash. In the first-generation J series, using it often resulted in some rather unflattering pictures. In the Galaxy J5 (2017), the front flash has, for lack of a better description, matured. It’s not about putting a heap of light in your face, but about taking a more balanced picture with fewer areas that are too dark or too light. I’m still no fan, but there are enough good reasons here to disagree with me.. In the video department, you won’t be shooting anything sharper than 1080p FHD resolution. The Galaxy J5 (2017) provides digital stabilization, which does a good job ironing out larger vibrations. However, particularly in low-light conditions, the stabilization cannot entirely keep up with smaller ones.. All in all, the cameras in the Galaxy J5 (2017) do not present any surprises. They shoot nice pictures in average conditions. For users who mostly want to share their snaps with family and friends through messengers and social media, this is fine. The front flash has, so I guess, become pretty useful by now. But with the J series getting a more premium design, the camera department is where paying less affects the overall experience. Perhaps not surprising, but something to be aware of nonetheless.. What applies to the camera, applies less and less to the software.. The first Galaxy J’s often lacked basic features found in slightly more expensive Samsung devices. The Galaxy J5 (2017) comes with Android 7.0 out of the box, and (more notably) runs the same version of the Samsung Experience UX as the Galaxy S8.. This means you can disable the app drawer entirely, or merely remove the button so you have to swipe up to access it. There is the secure folder, not only hiding images and files but entire apps and accounts. There is the theme store, that lets you install entire themes, or just the wallpaper, or a different set of icons.. There are different energy saving modes, and Samsung’s own cloud service Samsung Cloud is fully integrated. The blue light filter is present, and you can use two instances of some messenger apps – even outside of the secure folder.. In terms of the Galaxy J5 (2017)’s future software development, I cannot give you a definitive prediction. Going by previous J series models, at least one big update to the Android OS can be expected. In term of security updates, Samsung has been updating the phone’s predecessors roughly every second month, dropping to quarterly updates in the second year of its lifespan. I say ‘roughly’ because ultimately update frequency varies per market.. Now, a few paragraphs back I already briefly touched on the Galaxy J5 (2017)’s performance. Exynos 7870 system-on-a-chip is not very powerful.. Still, because of the display’s 720p resolution, it does not need to be. During daily use, the device feels smooth and fast enough. Even most games can be played reasonably well, once again, because of the modest pixel count.. Still, doing anything that requires more power often leads to delays. If you are installing, updating, or removing large applications, while doing something else, you will notice things can take a bit of time.. The Galaxy J5 (2017) sure is fast enough for the average user sending messages, sharing some pictures and playing a little game or two. Heavy users will find the combination of Exynos 7870 and its 2GB RAM lacking. This phone is not trying to impress the aficionado, though. It is trying to be ‘just fast enough’ for the average user. I guess it succeeds, particularly because of one aspect.. Like this year’s A series, the Galaxy J5 (2017) has its speaker located above the power button. Compared to last year’s J5, they provide a relatively balanced sound. There’s less treble, and more mid, though I still can’t call any of it bass. That is not Samsung’s fault, as tiny phone speakers are physically incapable of producing actual bass.. As for the earphones, slowly the time is approaching for Samsung to upgrade their mid-range earphone game. They did it with the Galaxy S8 , and hopefully cheaper phones will profit from the Harman acquisition eventually. The set that comes with the J5 (2017) is primarily one thing: cheap. For phone calls, it is satisfactory. For listening to music, not so much. Realistically, though, I did not expect much in this price range anyway. And if you bring your own headphones, the phone is capable of pushing out acceptable sound quality.. You might know the formula: decent battery size plus modest processor and resolution equal good battery life. This is the equation Samsung’s nails in the Galaxy J5 (2017). Even more convincingly than last year’s J series models, this year’s J5 (2017) squeezes two full days out of its 3,000 mAh battery in most usage scenarios.. The device continues the line Samsung has been following for some time now, where its mid-range phones generally have a battery life equal to or better than its flagship models. Unfortunately, one feature that did not reach the J series yet is fast charging. Through its micro-USB port, the J5 (2017) charges at an old-fashioned rate, though honestly, it is still pretty quick.. And while we’re talking about the battery of the Galaxy J5 (2017), there is another important observation to be made. Not only was Samsung known for its use of plastics, but for years an exchangeable battery was part of the South-Koreans’ practical approach. With the arrival of the full-metal J series, the user-exchangeable battery is almost gone from Samsung’s portfolio in most markets. Only niche-devices like the Galaxy Xcover 4 still have the required removable back plate. This, too, is a landmark of sorts. Just a very different one than Samsung’s use of metal in its cheaper devices.. Though the wrap-up of this review is in sight, we still must pay some attention to the fingerprint reader. Just as with the metal body, this is a welcome addition to Samsung’s lower mid-range lineup. On the Galaxy J5 (2017) it works without fuss. Like with other recent Galaxy devices , the fingerprint reader on this phone is always-on, too. To get to your start screen quickly, just put your thumb on the home key, and you will be there within a second. No need to press the key, mind you.. But aside from convenient unlocking, the fingerprint reader offers handy integration with features like Samsung Pass and Secure Folder. The first remembers user details for apps, services, and websites, so you can log-in everywhere using only your fingerprint. Secure Folder offers an extra secure environment without the Galaxy J5 (2017)’s usual interface. Here, you can store all kinds of content you don’t want to be accessible to other users of the phone. Furthermore, you can install entire applications in the Secure Folder, including user accounts that are not visible outside the folder.. In addition, the fingerprint reader makes the Galaxy J5 (2017) well suited for professional use. The same applies to various payment services, with Samsung Pay as a notable example, unfortunately with limited regional availability. The fingerprint reader provides functionality and versatility on a device that, in previous iterations, used to have clear limitations in this area. Or, in other words: despite its lower price point, the Galaxy J5 (2017) packs quite an elaborate set of features. And if you decide to get the dual-SIM version, you will still have a microSD slot, unlike in the dual-SIM Galaxy S8. You can use two SIM cards and still expand the 16GB internal storage.. The Galaxy J5 (2017) most certainly presents a notable evolution of Samsung’s J series. The device no longer feels like an entry-level phone, but rather, offers an impressive build quality. Battery life is great, and overall the J5 (2017) is a rich package stuffed with useful features: fingerprint reader, Samsung Pass, Secure folder, Samsung Cloud, FM radio, a microSD slot, dual messenger, themes and other customization options. The display looks great, even if no one would have been surprised about a panel with a higher pixel count.. Performance is sufficient for a vast majority of users shopping in the Galaxy J5 (2017)’s price range. The rear camera’s performance will be sufficient for most as well, and the front cam takes pretty good selfies. Is it a pity that the Galaxy J5 (2017) is not water resistant? Sure, though not many (if any) phones in the same price range offer such a body yet.. A real downside of the Galaxy J5 (2017), at least for some, could be the fact it no longer offers an exchangeable battery. Also, if you’re into heavy applications and games, you will notice limitations to the processing prowess of the device. In 2017 Samsung still considers a notification LED to be a high-end feature, as the Galaxy J5 (2017) has none.. Still, if you are looking for a solid, functional smartphone with solid battery performance, the Galaxy J5 (2017) checks pretty much all boxes. I’d go as far as to say that this is the Galaxy that offers the most bang for your buck, particularly since most buyers will pay much less than its initial pricing, as they acquire it in the course of the next 12 to 18 months. Samsung is planning to ship tens of millions of devices like this , and it is not hard to imagine them doing just that.. Reviews Galaxy J5 (2017).

Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) Duos Smartphone Review. Daniel Schmidt ( translated by Martina Osztovits), 06/30/2017. Android ARM Smartphone Touchscreen. With the update of its attractive Galaxy J series, we have the third generation of the J5 in our test. Samsung has radically changed the design and otherwise performs meaningful fine tuning. Fans of removable batteries will be disappointed, since the battery is now also built into the J5.. Update: OTA update with bug fixes released..

Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here .. Compared to the predecessor, Samsung has implemented the most extensive changes in the design of the Galaxy J5 (2017) SM-J530F. While earlier, there was only an aluminum frame and the rest was poly-carbonate, the manufacturer has now decided to wrap the whole smartphone into aluminum. The battery is now built-in and even shrunk slightly. In addition, the Galaxy J5 finally has a surrounding-light sensor to control the display brightness. Instead of the Snapdragon, there is now an in-house Exynos processor inside. Samsung has also updated the cameras. The front camera offers a generous 13 megapixels and the main camera is nominally more light sensitive at f/1.7. Nothing has changed in terms of the storage equipment, though. Besides 2 GB of working memory, there are 16 GB of eMMC storage, which can be expanded via a microSD card. We have the Duos model which can accept two SIM cards in our test.. Positive: the recommended price remains unchanged at 279 Euros (~$315). Anyone with a little patience can save even more, since by now the. Already one month after its release, the price has fallen to under 220 Euros (~$249) and since December it has continued to drop.. Lenovo Moto G5 Plus , the. BQ Aquaris X5 Plus , the. Sony Xperia XA1 , and the. is part of this price range and can offer a real alternative for fans of a small display.. Update 11/06/2017: A firmware update has been released. Details can be found in the software section..

In the 2017 model, Samsung has completely redesigned the Galaxy J5, following more their A series. Although this looks good, it also makes the smartphone large, slightly growing it around all the edges. We like the fact that not only is the camera flush with the case, but even recessed slightly, which protects the glass from scratches. Samsung does not specify anything about the glass in the front, but where it transitions into the aluminum can be clearly seen. The antenna recesses fit excellently into the design.. Due to the aluminum body, the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) is very sturdy and can neither be twisted, nor does anything creak when trying. Even though the material changes are clearly apparent, it is cleanly built and the gaps are small and even. It is a bit unfortunate, that the card trays and their covers are made entirely from plastic, which may lead to a color change over time compared to the aluminum case, although originally the colors are identical.. The smaller card tray accepts a Nano-SIM card and the wider one, a second Nano-SIM as well as a microSD card. While the battery could still be removed in the. it is built into the case and fixed in this model and cannot be replaced by the user. The smartphone is available in the colors black, gold, and blue.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) Duos has maintained its features that are almost unchanged in comparison to the. However, the SoC and LTE have become faster. The latter now supports one more band.. The bottom edge still provides a micro USB port. Samsung does not use the newer Type-C form factor in its entry-level series yet. This interface does not support video output, but OTG. Hence you cannot only connect external storage devices, but also peripherals. Unfortunately, the audio jack is also placed at the bottom edge. We would have wished it were on the top edge.. Our test model is the so-called Duos variant. This means that the smartphone can use two nano SIM cards simultaneously. It is a fully-fledged dual SIM variant, which also allows using a microSD card. The microSD slot supports the SDXC standard and therewith all usual storage media. Hence, it is possible to expand the storage capacity by up to 256 GB. However, it cannot be formatted as internal storage. Nevertheless, it is possible to move bigger apps to the optional microSD card.. Moreover, the Galaxy J5 supports Bluetooth 4.1, Ant+, Wi-Fi Direct and features an NFC chip as well as FM radio. A notification LED is not available.. The top edge is free of interfaces.. Left: Volume control, SIM slot, SIM and microSD slot. The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) uses Google Android 7.0 Nougat as operating system, which is skinned by the manufacturer's own TouchWiz UI. Among others, the Galaxy S8 also uses this UI. The software features are not restricted in any way. Apart from multitasking, the Game Tools and the Game Launcher are also available. The radio app appears very well-made to us. It starts an automatic channel search upon first launch and allows saving favorites, and recording channels. Moreover, several Microsoft apps are pre-installed, which cannot be completely uninstalled, but only deactivated.. The Android security patches are from 06-01-2017 and therewith up-to-date.. Update 11/06/2017: Samsung has started rolling out a new firmware, build NRD90M.J530FXXU1AQI3 (392 MB). In addition to stability improvements and bug fixes it is also supposed to contain new and enhanced features. However, we were unable to discover what exactly these were supposed to be. Googleâs security patches have been updated to 08/01/2017.. The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) can connect to the mobile data network via HSPA+ or fast LTE Cat. 6, which allows download rates of up to 300 MBit/s on paper. Therewith, it is at least double as fast as its. and supports the current standard of mobile network operators. The frequency coverage is also fully sufficient for Europe. Moreover, the Galaxy J5 supports Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and Wi-Fi telephony if this is also offered by the provider. Reception is okay, but connections sometimes dropped in the street in between houses, while other devices worked flawlessly there.. The Wi-Fi module of the smartphone supports the IEEE-802.11 standards a/b/g/n/ac and transmits in the 2.4 and 5.0 GHz frequency bands. The measurements with our reference router Linksys EA8500 showed very good and stable transfer rates. The range of the Wi-Fi is also very good. Even through an inside wall and in about 12 m (~39 ft) from the router, we still had a strong signal and could stream HD videos without problems..

The positioning of the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) is done via the satellite networks GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou. The satellite fix is quite fast, but it is not particularly accurate at the beginning and it takes some time to reach an accuracy of about six meters (~20 ft). Inside the building, the positioning is less accurate, yet possible. We took the Galaxy J5 on a short outing and compared it to the bike computer Garmin Edge 500 in order to better evaluate its positioning accuracy. The total deviation of the whole bike tour is just 10 meters (~33 ft). Furthermore, the smartphone also performs very well and records the course relatively accurately at a closer look.. The design of the telephony app is simple and clear. Hence, everyone should find their way around quickly. is a nice features and searches the area for amenities in order to directly show their contact data. This way, you can for example find the closest restaurant and book a table.. The call quality of the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) is not quite satisfactory. Voices sound dull on both sides. Furthermore, the voice of the J5 user is occasionally interrupted by small dropouts. The situation gets even worse with speakerphone. Those who plan a long phone call had better not use it. While the included headset does also lack noise cancelling, it performs quite well otherwise.. The front and the rear camera feature a resolution of 13 MP each. On paper, the camera above the display has improved a lot. With an f/1.9 aperture, its light sensitivity is relatively high. However it only features fixed focus. The recordings are quite decent under good light conditions as long as the subject does not move too fast. A LED can be used for brighter images in the dark.. The main camera has improved a lot and uses the same sensor from Sony, which is also used in the. An f/1.7 aperture suggests good light sensitivity. However, the relatively small pixels sized at 1.12 put this into perspective; even more so as the light sensitivity already reaches its maximum at ISO 1.250 (in manual mode ISO 800). LG has done a significantly better job in its flagship, but this belongs to an entirely different price category.. The shots of the Samsung Galaxy J5 are quite homogeneous in day light and deliver good results. In comparison to more expensive competitors, its dynamic range is quite limited. Thus bright parts could quickly get too bright. The smartphone compensates this by making the subject slightly darker, which shows in the comparison below. While the Galaxy collects much light and suppresses noise well under bad light conditions, contours and details get very blurry. As a result, shots already appear muddy at low magnification.. The J5 can record videos in Full HD (30 fps) at best. Due to the lack of image stabilization, the recordings blur quite easily and fast panning results in visible blurring.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3.

We took a closer look at the camera of the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) under controlled light conditions. The X-Rite ColorChecker Passport shows quite a bright color reproduction. Only few colors such as orange and light green have a slightly higher saturation. The basic colors of blue, red, and green are slightly too pale. On the other hand, the J5 achieves a quite accurate white balance, which is only tends to be slightly warm.. The Galaxy J5 performs well in reproducing our test charts. At the center of the image all details are represented sharp and rich in detail. However, the sharpness falls relatively sharply towards the edges..

Warranty is 12 months for the battery and 6 months for the accessories. The scope of delivery includes a modular power adapter rated at 7.75 watts (5 Volt, 1.55 Ampere), a USB cable, a headset and a small tool for opening the card slot. In addition, the package includes a small printed quick start guide and a few flyers with warranty information, security hints and regional restrictions.. Optional accessories were not offered in Samsung's shop at the time of testing.. The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) features a capacitive touchscreen, which can recognize and handle up to five simultaneous inputs. The gliding traits are very good and inputs are recognized quickly and reliably. Moreover, the display can be easily cleaned.. is used as default keyboard layout. It has a very clean design and also supports features such as swiping and automatic word suggestions. If you do not like it, you can install any layout from the Play Store.. The fingerprint sensor sits in the home button and appears to be very good. It proved to be responsive and reliable and upon unlocking the user gets direct access to the system without pressing the button even if the smartphone is in standby. The two sensor buttons beside the home button also react reliably. However, unfortunately, they are not lit. One-hand mode is kept simple, yet effective.. Subpixel grid of the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017). The Super AMOLED display of the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) measures 5.2 inches and has a 1280x720 pixel resolution. Thus, it could be a little sharper, especially since most of the competitors in this price range already offer Full HD. On the other hand, there is finally an auto-brightness sensor which controls the brightness of the display. The maximum brightness can only be achieved with the sensor active. If the brightness is adjusted manually, we can only measure 300 cd/mÂ² in the screen center. In the more relevant measurement with an even distribution of bright and dark areas (APL50) we were able to measure up to 546 cd/mÂ².. Due to the Super AMOLED technology being used, each pixel is illuminated separately, which leads to a perfect black value. In theory, this results in a contrast ratio trending towards the infinite. Clouding or light halos are alien to this panel technology. For evenings, there is a blue-light filter which is supposed to be easy on the eyes in the dark.. 450 cd/m² 449 cd/m² 432 cd/m² 468 cd/m² 448 cd/m² 441 cd/m² 476 cd/m² 452 cd/m² 440 cd/m². 91 % Center on Battery: 448. cd/m²) ΔE Color 2.7 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 1.6 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.06.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 240.4 Hz. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 240.4. Hz is relatively low, so sensitive users will likely notice flickering and experience eyestrain at the stated brightness setting and below.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8982 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. OLED displays use PWM for brightness control. This is also true for the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017). PWM is also present at maximum brightness. However, the amplitude variation is very small. The flickering first increases at 63% brightness and lower and hovers at 240 Hz. It remains relatively constant down to the minimum brightness of about 4 cd/mÂ². The amplitude variation is also relatively small here. Hence, only sensitive persons should feel the effects of PWM.. Samsung's Super AMOLED displays shine with intensive colors and crisp contrasts. This also conforms to our subjective impression of the Galaxy J5 (2017). Nevertheless, we have examined the panel more closely with the photo spectrometer and the CalMAN analysis software. The colors are very accurate and are oriented towards the big AdobeRGB color space, which is not fully covered however. Almost all color deviations remains below a DeltaE of 4. Hence, they are almost invisible to the naked eye. Only red is different and is displayed very saturated.. Grayscale (profile: simple, target color space: sRGB).

This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.2 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) performs quite well in outdoor use. This is primarily thanks to its high brightness and good contrast ratio. However the panel surface reflects visibly and it is particularly difficult to make out anything from flat angles in bright environments.. The viewing angle stability of the Super AMOLED panel in the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) is good. Regardless of the angle, color inversions and ghosting effects cannot be observed. Only a slight brightness decrease is noticeable and the image gets a slight cyan haze. However, the latter is only noticeable in dark environments and is masked by reflections otherwise..

The chipset has a processor with eight Cortex-A53 cores that each clock at up to 1.6 GHz and were manufactured in the 14 nm process. There are 2 GB of LPDDR3 working memory and 16 GB of internal storage. The graphics calculations are performed by an. The provided CPU performance is about on par with faster competitors. Within the comparison group, only the Moto G5 Plus ( Snapdragon 625 ) performs slightly better. The smartphones from Lenovo and Huawei also perform better than our test model in system performance. In everyday life, these minor weaknesses are noticeable through short delays when switching between apps. Upday app in particular slows down the Galaxy J5.. In the graphics benchmarks, it quickly becomes apparent that the Samsung smartphone has very little reserves, since the manufacturer has incorporated the one core variant of the ARM Mali-T830. As the J5 only uses a 720p display, this is hardly noticeable in the onscreen tests.. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) Duos.

Samsung has moved the mono speaker from the bottom edge to the side in the Galaxy J5 (2017). Hence, it is almost impossible to accidentally cover it. The component performs quite well at average volume and delivers a relatively decent sound. The mid tones in particular are accurate. At maximum volume, especially the medium highs distort. As a result, for example, sibilants appear very hard and sharp to the listener.. Subjectively, the audio jack of the smartphone appears good and transmits sound cleanly and with low noise. The included headset is very present in the lower middles and higher bass range. As a result, sound appears slightly muffled.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 32 25 25.4 38.4 31 25.3 34 40 32.9 30 50 33.6 29.6 63 31.6 28.5 80 28.4 29.3 100 27 31.8 125 20.8 34.9 160 22 43.4 200 21.3 49.1 250 20.8 55.5 315 21.2 60.7 400 19.4 63.7 500 19.5 67.4 630 17.7 70.2 800 17.9 71.4 1000 17.8 68.9 1250 17.3 70 1600 17.4 72.6 2000 16.7 75.1 2500 17.2 77.4 3150 18.2 78.1 4000 17.9 81.4 5000 17.6 76.7 6300 17.7 75.4 8000 17.8 74.5 10000 17.9 70.5 12500 18.1 61.8 16000 18.2 58.4 SPL 30 86.8 N 1.3 70 median 17.9 Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) Duos median 70 Delta 1.3 9.5 29.6 29 29.6 28.4 28.6 28.4 27.7 29.4 27.7 28.8 32.8 28.8 28.6 28.8 28.6 25.7 25 25.7 24.9 25.4 24.9 26.6 27.7 26.6 34.2 28.7 34.2 33.5 21.8 33.5 43.6 21.8 43.6 48.8 22.3 48.8 54 21.1 54 58.7 21.6 58.7 60.9 21.3 60.9 62.7 18.1 62.7 65.2 20.3 65.2 67.3 19.6 67.3 69.4 19.5 69.4 73.6 16.3 73.6 74.1 16.1 74.1 75.7 15.6 75.7 75.4 15.5 75.4 68.1 15.4 68.1 72.6 15.1 72.6 74.1 15.2 74.1 76.2 15.1 76.2 76.8 15.1 76.8 70.7 15 70.7 55.8 15.1 55.8 85 29.7 85 59.6 1.3 59.6 median 67.3 Huawei P10 Lite median 18.1 median 67.3 11.6 3.3 11.6 31.6 35.1 25.4 34.8 25.3 30.4 32.9 29.4 33.6 27.2 31.6 35.7 28.4 34.9 27 38.7 20.8 40.6 22 45.4 21.3 48.4 20.8 52.8 21.2 59.3 19.4 62.1 19.5 66 17.7 72.1 17.9 76.7 17.8 77.3 17.3 75.2 17.4 72.2 16.7 71.6 17.2 68.8 18.2 68.5 17.9 67.2 17.6 66.5 17.7 65.6 17.8 62.7 17.9 57.6 18.1 53.2 18.2 44.3 30 83.5 1.3 54.4 median 17.9 Lenovo Moto G5 Plus median 65.6 1.3 8.2 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

In review: Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) Duos SM-J530F. With the new edition of the Galaxy J5, Samsung has succeeded in creating a well-made new device of the upper entry-level class. Many smartphones will once again be compared to this smartphone this year. The Koreans have not focused on superlatives, but improved the core competences of the J5. Despite a slightly low resolution, the display convinces and is unrivaled in terms of color representation in its price class. On top of that, it convinces with high brightness and high contrast. Most important: Samsung has finally incorporated an ambient light sensor in the J5 - which has been long overdue..

The updated Galaxy J5 is a solid performer. Battery life exceeded our expectations, the new design is favourable over its predecessor, and its camera is impressive for a handset of this calibre.. An updated, improved and highly desirable budget smartphone. Samsung’s updated Galaxy J5 does everything you could ask for.

The only issue is that price hike... Samsung’s updated Galaxy J5 does everything you could ask for. It’s a solid performer when put side-by-side with its competition, battery life is excellent, the new design is top-notch and its camera is far improved over last year’s effort.. The only issue is that price hike. For £140, last year’s J5 felt like a real bargain, despite its limitations. The new Galaxy J5 is a stronger phone in almost every way, but at £240 we’re starting to creep towards OnePlus territory, and that’s a fight the J5 can’t win. Overall though it’s still a fantastic deal - a brilliant smartphone for less than half the price of the popular flagships.. Make way for the new mid-range hero. Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) brings many improvements compared to its successful predecessor and this makes it more than accomplished model.

Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) brings many improvements compared to its successful predecessor and this makes it more than accomplished model. First of all, the device comes with an entirely metal design which is not always seen in this price range. There is a fingerprint sensor built in the hardware Home button. It is quite surprising that we don’t find a USB Type-C port but this is a drawback which can be ignored.. Build quality worthy of a high-end phone. The Galaxy J7 (2016) was the default phone to recommend last year for a complete package on a budget coming from one of the big names. With the Exynos 7870 made available to the 5 this season, and the metal build and design shared with the bigger brother, the J5 (2017) may as well be the standard for a no-frills all-rounder in 2017..

Solid build quality, very good battery life. At the end of the day, the Galaxy J5 (2017) feels like an ‘okay’ affordable phone, but is not pushing any boundaries. It has one of the best interfaces around: sleek and modern-looking, it has Samsung’s excellent apps, and it has a very solid battery life. At the end of the day, the Galaxy J5 (2017) feels like an ‘okay’ affordable phone, but is not pushing any boundaries. It has one of the best interfaces around: sleek and modern-looking, it has Samsung’s excellent apps, and it has a very solid battery life. But its camera and, most importantly, performance are underwhelming. The phone often feels stuttery and the camera lacks in detail and speed. And we know the terrible state of Android updates for phones like the J5 (2017). In such a fiercely competitive market, the J5 (2017) does too little to stand out.. Samsung impressively demonstrates what it means to create an efficient product. With the new edition of the Galaxy J5, Samsung has succeeded in creating a well-made new device of the upper entry-level class. Many smartphones will once again be compared to this smartphone this year. The Koreans have not focused on superlatives, but improved the core competences of the J5.

Many smartphones will once again be compared to this smartphone this year. The Koreans have not focused on superlatives, but improved the core competences of the J5. Despite a slightly low resolution, the display convinces and is unrivaled in terms of color representation in its price class. On top of that, it convinces with high brightness and high contrast. Most important: Samsung has finally incorporated an ambient light sensor in the J5 - which has been long overdue.. Darn, there are no reviews yet for. Be the first to write a review ..

Home / News / Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017) hands-on. hands-on: Build quality Display Software and performance Fingerprint reader Camera and battery life Overall impression. the revamped Galaxy J (2017) series marks a significant event. in the development of Samsung’s hardware design.. Though some markets already saw the launch of similarly built devices late last year (check our Galaxy J7 Prime review , for example) most Western buyers will only get their hands on Samsung’s new premium Galaxy J lineup in the coming weeks. my hands on the first device of the series to be launched, the Galaxy J5 (2017), and will now share a few quick first impressions.. After many years of repeated ridicule over its cheap choice of materials,. it is safe to say the Galaxy J5 (2017) proves Samsung has learned from the past. While it is easy to see progress in expensive flagship devices like the Galaxy S8 , the arrival of a full metal body in. the much more affordable Galaxy J series is perhaps an even more significant landmark. After all, Samsung expects to sell one hundred million of these units. And with the Galaxy J5 (2017), it is not all that hard to imagine that happening, especially when you consider how well the earlier J series phones have done in the market.. The device feels very, very solid. The smooth curves and cool back plate certainly give the. device a more sturdy, premium feel than the Galaxy S6 , which was considered flagship material a mere two years ago. In fact, were it not for the lack of IP68-rating, I would prefer the hardware of the J5 (2017) over that of the Galaxy A5 (2017) by quite a margin.. Notwithstanding the excellent design, the Galaxy J5 (2017) is not a high-end phone. Therefore, the AMOLED display comes with a somewhat modest 720p HD resolution. If you try hard, you can see some pixels, thanks to Samsung’s loyalty to the. PenTile subpixel matrix, making it similar to the J5 (2016) in this regard.. Then again, a vast majority of users will never notice. I know you can get a phone with a 1080p display in this price class, but there’s something to be said for choosing AMOLED over LCD in spite of resolution. I will reserve final judgment until our full review of this device, but as a first impression, the display of J5 (2017) is fine, even without winning any awards for pixel density.. Something similar can be said of the performance of the Galaxy J5 (2017). The Exynos 7870 SoC can also be found in the Galaxy J7 (2016) as well as the Galaxy A3 (2017), and was designed with one thing in mind: energy efficiency. The chip delivers sufficient performance to run Android 7.0 and the Samsung Experience UX smoothly.. The latter comes in version 8.1, which is the same as found on the Galaxy S8. And indeed, though a little less feature-rich, it is the same, offering plenty of customization options. Choose new themes and icon packs, and set how many apps your home screen and app drawer shows. Even entirely disabling the app drawer is an option, just like on the S8. Furthermore, there are features like Secure Folder, Blue light filter, and Samsung Cloud integration. And to be sure: there is no trace of. Slowly but surely Samsung is fulfilling its. promise to bring secure authentication methods to affordable devices. So yes, the Galaxy J5 (2017) comes equipped with a fingerprint reader (so did the J7 Prime, but that device was limited to a very few markets). In line with the overall user experience described above, it works well. It is always on, so you can unlock the phone without pressing the home key. But also when using it with Samsung Pass or Secure Folder it is an easy, fuss-free solution that is a welcome addition to Samsung’s lower mid-range portfolio.. short period of playing around with the Galaxy J5 (2017) is not at all sufficient to say anything useful about cameras or battery life. From what I’ve seen, the former should. be more or less on par with the device’s price range, while the latter seems to be very promising. But again, you will have to wait for the final review for a definitive opinion. I will add that if there are any fans of easily exchangeable batteries left in 2017, the J5 is no longer a device that accommodates this requirement. Here, too, the design now trumps flexibility.. The most important takeaway from this short Galaxy J5 (2017) hands-on, is that Samsung is indeed upping its affordable smartphone game in a big way. Mind you, it won’t be dirt cheap when it launches in Europe costing €279. However, most buyers will be paying considerably less for it, as prices decline in the course of the next twelve months. If the battery life does what the specifications promise, and the camera turns out to be at least up to the standard of its class, I have no problem imagining Samsung selling this phone by the boatload. Stay tuned for the full review.. Reviews Galaxy J5 (2017) SM-J530. February 2018 security patch rolling out for the Galaxy J7 and Galaxy J5 (2017). Galaxy J5 (2017) January 2018 update released.

You must be logged in to post a comment.. A5 2017 or J7 2017 ? I don’t know what to choose.. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 1 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. To be honest, Samsung’s non-flagship cameras are rather average this year due to the lack of optical image stabilization. Too many images get blurred because the camera’s slow at focusing, and we’d wager the J7 (2017) will be the same, so it wouldn’t matter. We’ll let you know once we’re done with the review, however, after we’ve tested them out.. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 1 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. So bettery to stay with A5 2016 with OIS ? I compared J5 2017 with my A5 2016 and I do not see big difference. I would also tell I think J5 2017 take better photos than A5 2016 in my test in shop.. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. There is always difference between entry and mid. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 1 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. Yes, but J7 2017 looks better than A5 2016 on paper. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 1 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 1 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. So, which is better ? J7 2017 or A5 2016 ?. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. Since both J5 and J7 main camera sensors are at f1.7 aperture, it should have Dual Pixel PDAF.. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 1 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. Many Samsung phones have F1.7 aperture these days, but Dual Pixel autofocus is only on its flagships. PDAF is different, but Samsung’s new J series doesn’t have that either. It’s standard autofocus like the 2017 A series phones, and it rather sucks in low-light and indoor conditions thanks to the blur it induces in many shots.. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. “However, unlike the previous Galaxy A5 (2016) there is no OIS or Optical Image Stabilization for the Galaxy A5 (2017) but Samsung have equipped the camera with PDAF or Phase Detection Auto Focus which handles light and captures details better.”. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. The reference of the camera in A5 2017 is S5K3P8. it’s have PDAF auto focus and EIS but samsung disabled The EIS. go search about the front camera of OP3T it’s the same that in a5 with EIS. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. J7 2017 is better, but only on paper. You should probably wait for the full review.. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 1 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. What about top microhpone ? J7 don’t have top microphone compared to A5 2017. So call quality will be bad ?. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. Does this phone and the J7 2017 support fast charging?. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. No, no fast charging on J series. Samsung’s gotta do something to keep some distance between these phones and the A series, I guess.. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. It no longer matters, it comes with a 5V-1.55A charger, it sucks. You Must Be Logged In To Vote 0 You Must Be Logged In To Vote. Galaxy X foldable smartphone won’t be a gimmick, says Samsung CEO. Galaxy S9 super slow-motion feature will be available on other devices. Benchmark scores for the Galaxy S9’s Exynos variant are impressive.
