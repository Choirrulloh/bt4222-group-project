Hardware inside 5.5-inch HD display with 1,280x720-pixel resolution 8-megapixel camera 5-megapixel front-facing camera 1.1GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor (MSM8909) 16GB storage; 2GB RAM 2,500mAh battery MicroSD card up to 128GB Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Who says a big phone has to cost the moon? Alcatel's Fierce 4, a 5.5-inch beast, offers large-screen lovers a budget deal. In the US, it sells for $69 with prepaid carrier MetroPCS. T-Mobile will sell it in the fall, but we don't have pricing yet.. And with it comes the typical specs trade-offs to make the phone more affordable. Like the 720-pixel screen resolution, which is low for an expansive display, an 8-megapixel camera and the lower-powered processor. This is a phone for first-timers, for casual users and for people who really just need an inexpensive phone.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 12.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 21.9 days (526 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

Worst nightmare when it comes to phones & asked questions before bought it...got the first one in Sept of 2017 now on third one Jan 2018..every one of them automatically answered..n metro pcs kept replacing of course with same kind I'm not paying them to upgrade ...but now I have no lock screen...can't update apps...multipul functions not working...talked with a corporate store in January it's now February ...called other day again...but at time in January only we're going to replace it with same kind....emailed corporate in January and told them would have no problem complaining to the better business bureau...if they have a serious garbage phone like this one ....they need to keep the customer as one and replace it with another kind of choice of equal value....and all the accessories too free..... Had less then 2 months it randomly vibrating, restarts whenever it fill lile it multiple times a day. Has a mind of it's own. Stops charging whenever it feels like it. I charged it for 6 hours and it went from 39% to 67%.Unbelievable.I took it back to the store and the Clerk updated the software. It started charging normally for 3 days, then barely charging at all. It changes wallpaper and my ringtone at random. Never saw such a creepy phone. I'm buying an Apple tomorrow and will never buy another phone from this company again!. Worst phone I've ever owned! Will connect to Bluetooth in your car when it wants and not work the next day, same with connecting to WiFi. Idiots at metro will be more than happy to tell you this pos phone and metro won't do anything to compensate or train their people to guide you to a better choice. So yeah it's a perfect phone for a hammer or a semi truck to run over!!! I spent $90 and now will be purchasing another phone before the first month of owning this pos is over:( don't buy ever ! Couldn't pay me or give me one for free!!!. after about a year of having it, I had 3 different chargers and it took an hour to charge my phone only 2 percent. This is the biggest piece of junk that i have ever bought, and will never buy another alcatel again, for starters the volume is the worst of any phone ever made,and thats only the start of the problems with this phone, they dont care about customers at alcatel, only passing off their bs as working phones,,do not buy the alcatel fierce 4, its a waste of money,. THE BATTERY IS THE MAIN ISSUE !! fully charged in the morning and by mid afternoon it needs to be charged again. the speaker volume is very low to.. Volume does suck everything else works well. This has been a good reliable phone for the last year for me. Camera could be better and I'm sure my friends and family with the more expensive phones do much better. This is a pretty reliable phone and the price is excellent. I have videos on my youtube channel from recording using the camera which is HD. I use the battery saver mode a lot and it works like a charm. It is slow once in awhile, but a simple restart is all it needs and it'll work amazingly again. Anonymous, 26 Apr 2017 Metro won't stand behind their phone gives you a big run around Biggest price of crap ever ever ever hate this phone don't ever buy fierce 4&#128557;. Totally disappointed hate this phone sucks. Anonymous, 23 Aug 2017 This phone SUCKS!!! Can't get the volume straight, it constantly loses volume to where I have ... more I bought the same phone today..I love it. This phone SUCKS!!! Can't get the volume straight, it constantly loses volume to where I have to constantly reset it for proper sound ...and that lasts for very little time! I wish I had gotten a different phone!!!. Kwayja, 19 Jul 2017 This phone when I got it, was to replace my Gallexy S Prime, which I regret doing. more This post is exactly what I came to see cause my phone started doing the same smh. The volume is crap way too low and goes up and down on its own when i plug it into my headphones. Dirteediana, 15 Jun 2017 My phone is... Acceptable, but I do have an issue with the volume... more Yeah my phone work real well ,best phone i had so far,alot of internal memory space and everything. Not an upgrade from the Fierce XL. Volume is pathetic and the camera is not an improvement. I regret wasting the money on it. When I can afford a much better phone I'll use this one for target practice.. Kl2, 03 Jun 2017 As long as you didn't use 60 minutes talk time on it and it was as you purchase it , They were... more They won't refund!! This phone is really bad!. This phone when I got it, was to replace my Gallexy S Prime, which I regret doing. Fortunately, I still have my Gallexy, but that's beside the point. The phone is slow, in comparison, it lags, as mentioned in previous posts, the volume is reduced to half when attached to any aux cord or bluetooth devices, it sometimes powers off on it's own....the list goes on. The most recent issue to arrise is that now it doesn't power when attached to a charger. First I thought it was an issue with the charger, but after having tried multiple chargers and multiple outlets, it's clearly the battery. The issue started to become apparent to me after I noticed it had issues retaining life, which I blamed on having apps run in the background....but even after closing all unused apps, it still would drain at roughly 10% per 10minutes. The price of the phone was affordable, but it's still not worth the money you'll be wasting. I've only had my phone for about 8 months, and it is unacceptable that it at this point is now a paperweight. The biggest frustraition is that I cannot remove the battery, so I don't know if it's a battery issue or an issue with the phone overall. If you're looking for a decent phone that will do the job you need, I'd suggest not looking at this phone, rather look at the gallexies and spend the extra little bit of money to get the quality you're expecting to be pay for..

MetroPCS and T-Mobile get their hands on Alcatel's $70 Fierce 4. Alcatel might have released its Idol 4 and Idol 4S flagship phones, but that does not mean the company forgot about how to make extremely affordable options, which is where the Fierce 4 comes in.. Starting on the outside, the Fierce 4 features a 5.5-inch, 1,280-by-720 resolution display. under a sheet of Dragontrail glass,. an uncommon material given how Gorilla Glass is the industry standard. Above that display sits a 5-megapixel camera with an 84-degree wide-angle lens for group selfies, while. Under the hood, a 1.1GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 chipset and 2GB RAM power the Fierce 4, with the 16GB of native storage expandable by up to an additional 32GB through the MicroSD card slot. Keeping the lights on is a decently-sized 2,500mAh battery, which, when combined with the low-power processor and lower resolution display, should allow you to use the phone from morning through the night.. Alas, the Fierce 4 runs Android Marshmallow out of the box, with no word as to whether the phone will receive an update to Nougat sometime. Even so, keep in mind that everything on paper points to the phone being an entry-level phone at most, so if it is the latest and greatest that you are looking for, you might want to look elsewhere.. For those who are interested, the $70 price tag is more than enticing, particularly if you are looking for either a secondary phone or a. first smartphone for a loved one.. Keep in mind that price seems to apply. only because potential customers get a $60 rebate, which means they will have to fork over $130 at checkout. Furthermore, the phone will not be available unlocked — you will need to go prepaid on either MetroPCS or T-Mobile to get your hands on the Fierce 4.. deterred you, the Fierce 4 is currently available through MetroPCS , with T-Mobile.

MetroPCS Terms and Conditions of Service. When you initiate Service with MetroPCS, you may receive a Start of Service form and this Agreement. These materials, including applicable supplemental terms and conditions, and your Rate Plan terms, are part of your Agreement with MetroPCS (collectively, the “Agreement”). This Agreement governs the sale, use, and delivery of MetroPCS wireless services ("Service" or "Services") to you (the purchaser or user of the Services) by T-Mobile USA, Inc. and any of its controlled subsidiaries, assignees, and agents ("us," "we," "our" or "MetroPCS"). Certain other laws may also govern our provision of Services to you and such laws are incorporated in their entirety by this reference into this Agreement as if set forth in this Agreement. Your Service is also subject to, and you agree to adhere to, our business policies, practices, and procedures, which we can change at any time without notice to you (collectively, the "Policies"). Offers may not be available everywhere or combinable with other promotions/options. Your Rate Plan includes your allotments for minutes, messages or data, rates, coverage and other terms (“Rate Plan”). The Agreement makes up the complete agreement between you and us, and supersedes any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements, arrangements, representations, advertising, contracts, statements, offers, and understandings relating to the subject matter of the Agreement, whether oral or written, including, but not limited to, all previous versions of the Terms and Conditions of Service. You cannot rely on any other documents or statements by any sales person, service representative or other agent. You acknowledge and agree that you have not relied on any representation, assertion, guarantee, warranty, contract or other assurance, stated or made by anyone except those set out in this Agreement.. IMPORTANT : READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES THE USE OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN LITIGATION BECAUSE IT USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY AND ALLOWS FOR LESS DISCOVERY AND LESS APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.. YOUR AGREEMENT WITH METROPCS STARTS WHEN YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU AGREE TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND POLICIES BY DOING ANY OF THE FOLLOWING: (A) GIVING US A WRITTEN OR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE, OR TELLING US ORALLY THAT YOU ACCEPT; (B) ACTIVATING OR CONTINUING SERVICE; (C) USING YOUR SERVICE AFTER YOUR SERVICE IS ACTIVATED OR YOU MAKE A CHANGE OR ADDITION TO YOUR SERVICE; (D) PAYING FOR THE SERVICE; OR (E) FAILING TO ACTIVATE SERVICE WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE PURCHASE OF YOUR WIRELESS DEVICE.. IF YOU ARE A NEW CUSTOMER AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT DO ANY OF THESE THINGS.. IF YOU ARE AN EXISTING CUSTOMER AND THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED TO YOU UNDER A PRIOR AGREEMENT AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST TERMINATE SERVICE AS SET FORTH IN THE PRIOR AGREEMENT ; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IF YOU CHOOSE TO TERMINATE SERVICE YOU WILL STILL BE BOUND BY THE PRIOR AGREEMENT, INCLUDING YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY ANY OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS AND YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, DO NOT ACTIVATE OR USE YOUR SERVICE, AND CONTACT METROPCS OR ITS AUTHORIZED DEALERS TO HAVE YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED.. We each agree that, except as provided below, any and all claims or Disputes between you and us, in any way related to or concerning the Agreement, our Privacy Policy, our Services, devices or products, will be resolved by binding arbitration. This includes any claims against other parties relating to Services or wireless devices provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers, Dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding. "Dispute" shall be given the broadest possible meaning and shall include any dispute, claim, or controversy arising from or relating to this Agreement or Services and/or Products provided under this Agreement, including but not limited to: (1) all claims for relief and all theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, fraud, or misrepresentation; (2) all disputes regarding the validity, enforceability or scope of this arbitration agreement (with the exception of its class action waiver); (3) all disputes that arose before this Agreement; (4) all disputes that arise after the termination of this Agreement; and (5) all disputes that are the subject of a putative class action in which no class has been certified. References in this provision to "us" include our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns and our and their directors, officers, employees and agents. References in this provision to "you" include all beneficiaries of this Agreement and all users of the Services provided under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court or bring Disputes to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, but not limited to, the Federal Communications Commission.. If you do not wish to be bound by this arbitration agreement, you must notify us of your desire to do so within 30 days of initiating Service, or, if you have never had the opportunity to opt out of arbitration, within 30 days of the date of the change notice giving you the opportunity. To do so, please visit www.metropcsdisputeresolution.com and follow the instructions on that site. Your decision to opt out of this arbitration agreement will not adversely affect our relationship with or delivery of Service to you. If you have previously notified us of your decision to opt out of this arbitration agreement, you need not do so again.. For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to the address in Section 16 below. We each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. If we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration. We each agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or this Agreement.. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if we change this arbitration agreement, you may reject the change without terminating or adversely affecting your Service by notifying us in writing at the address set forth in the "Notices" section below within 30 days of the date of the change notice. If you do, you shall arbitrate any Dispute in accordance with the terms of this arbitration agreement. If you do not, you will be bound by the changes.. Because this Agreement and the Services provided under this Agreement concern interstate commerce, this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA").. The party initiating arbitration may choose from the following independent, impartial arbitration administrators:. Copies of their respective rules for consumer disputes and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration may be obtained by contacting them or visiting their websites. Any arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the arbitration administrator's rules for consumer disputes in effect when the arbitration is initiated except to the extent they are inconsistent with this arbitration agreement. If the arbitration administrator will not enforce this arbitration agreement as written, the parties shall agree on or mutually petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a substitute arbitration administrator who will do so. The arbitrator shall enforce contractual, statutory and other limitation periods and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.. If we initiate the arbitration, we will notify you in writing at your then-current account address or (if your account is closed) the last address at which we contacted you. If you initiate the arbitration, you must notify us in writing at the address set forth in the "Notices" section below.. If your Dispute does not exceed $10,000, we will promptly reimburse your filing fee and will pay the arbitrator's other fees, costs and expenses. (If you cannot pay the filing fee, you may request that we pay the filing fee directly.) If, however, the arbitrator finds that your Dispute is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, you shall reimburse the filing fee to us and the payment of the arbitrator's others fees, costs and expenses shall be governed by the arbitration administrator's rules.. You may hire an attorney to represent you in the arbitration proceeding and may recover your reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration to the same extent as you could in court if the arbitration proceeding is decided in your favor. We may hire an attorney to represent us in the arbitration proceeding but waive any right to recover our attorneys' fees and costs if the arbitration proceeding is decided in our favor.. Unless you and we agree otherwise in writing, any arbitration hearings will be held in the county of your then-current account address or (if your account is closed) the last address at which we contacted you.. If the arbitration provision applies or you choose arbitration to resolve your disputes, then either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent (see Section 16) to begin arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will arbitrate all disputes. For claims less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that total less than $75,000. For claims that total more than $75,000, the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees. In addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Except for claims determined to be frivolous, Metro PCS agrees not to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you.. If you choose to pursue your claim in court by opting out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action Waiver provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out requirements above.. If a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration,. WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL .. ARBITRATION INVOLVES A FAIR HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR RATHER THAN A JUDGE OR JURY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY NAMED IN THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, or otherwise in this Agreement, neither party has the right to bring a Dispute or other legal action under this Agreement more than one (1) year after the Dispute arose.. If you terminate your Service, your termination will be effective at the end of your current month of Service (unless you port-out your number), and you will remain responsible for all fees and Charges for your Service and usage through the end of that period. If we terminate your Service, we will determine the date of termination, and you will be responsible for all usage and Charges through the date of termination. You can request that we port your number to another carrier, and Service for that number will be terminated when the porting is complete.. If you port your number, you will be responsible for all usage and Charges until the port-out is complete.. The Services are provided via Rate Plans under which you do not pay metered "per minute" charges for service. In an effort to offer this Service on a reliable basis, MetroPCS may discontinue providing Service to you, change the services provided to you, change your Rate Plan, reduce the speed of any service provided, restrict the amount of use of any service, change the services and features in your Rate Plan, discontinue your account, or discontinue or limit providing connections to particular telephone numbers, countries, destinations, providers, features, requested or called by you or the provision of certain services in certain areas, such as pursuant to roaming arrangements, or services that appear likely to generate abnormally high use, or other disproportionate use when compared to those of other customers of MetroPCS (as described below under Section 24 "Your Use Of The Service") or which may be harmful, disruptive, or interfere with MetroPCS' system or services to other customers. We may provide notice to you prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, but you acknowledge and agree that we are not required to provide notice and you agree that we may take any of the foregoing actions without providing notice you. By initiating service and placing calls or using any other service on the MetroPCS system, you acknowledge and agree to MetroPCS' ability to modify or terminate your Service under these circumstances.. For MetroPCS Device and accessory returns and exchanges, see the applicable return policy, which is available at your place of purchase. Amounts paid for Service charges are non-refundable.. If your Service is terminated for any reason and you have a positive balance in your Service account, you will not be entitled to receive any refund.. This Section describes how changes may be made to your Agreement, is subject to requirements and limitations imposed by applicable law, and will not be enforced to the extent prohibited by law. We may change the price and structure of your Rate Plan, modify the various Rate Plans, change the price of the various Rate Plans, change the services included in a Rate Plan, or change the requirements of eligibility for Rate Plans, at any time without prior notice to you. You may designate others to manage or make changes to your account ("Authorized Users"). You and any Authorized Users on your account will have access to all account information. If you give your personal account validation information to someone, they can access, and may be able to make changes to your account just as you can, including incurring charges for which you are responsible. Those changes will be binding on you. MetroPCS takes no responsibility for changes made to your account by any Authorized User.. With respect to domestic long distance, roaming, international long distance, and any other service provided by us (or to us by third parties), we may change the locations and destinations where such Services may be used or where calls can be placed or placed in specific Rate Plans, or the rates and terms applicable to such locations and destinations, without prior notice to you. Certain charges may be imposed by third parties and MetroPCS may, as an accommodation, allow such charges to be paid through MetroPCS.. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THESE RATE PLAN CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THE RATE PLAN CHANGES, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE CHANGE THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT NOTIFY US THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE WITHIN THAT TIME AND/OR IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICE AFTER THE RATE PLAN CHANGES, YOU ACCEPT THE CHANGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMINATION, AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.. We may change this Agreement at any time. If you are an existing customer, you will be notified at least ten (10) days, unless a longer period is required, in advance of any proposed changes that may result in more restrictive terms or conditions in this Agreement. Any such changes to this Agreement will be effective after that time period.. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THE CHANGES, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE CHANGE NOTICE THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT NOTIFY US THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE WITHIN THAT TIME AND/OR IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICE AFTER NOTIFICATION OF THE CHANGES, YOU ACCEPT THE CHANGES.. * Your Wireless Device and Compatibility with Other Networks and Equipment. You may buy a wireless device to use on our Service from us or someone else, but it must, as solely determined by us, comply with Federal Communications Commission regulations, be certified for use on our network, and be compatible with, and not potentially harm, our Service or our network. Our Services will only work with wireless devices compatible with our network and not all services are available with all wireless devices or on all networks. Some features and Rate Plans will be available only on MetroPCS wireless devices purchased from us. At times we may remotely change your wireless device's software, applications or programming, without notice to address security, safety, or other issues that impact our network or your device. These changes will modify your wireless device and may affect or erase data you have. stored on your wireless device, or how you have programmed or use your wireless device. A MetroPCS wireless device is designed to be used only with our service and on our network. Your wireless device may not work with another wireless network, or the other wireless carrier may not accept your wireless device on its network. If your wireless device was purchased from MetroPCS or an authorized MetroPCS dealer, the wireless device has a software programming lock that will prevent the wireless device from operating with other compatible wireless telephone carriers' services. Please see www.metropcs.com/unlockpolicy for information regarding our software programming unlocking policy. Your wireless device may contain sensitive or personal information. MetroPCS is not responsible for any information on your wireless device, including sensitive or personal information. If possible, you should remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive or personal information when your wireless device is out of your possession or control, including, but not limited to, relinquishing, exchanging, returning or recycling your wireless device. By providing your wireless device to us, you agree that our employees, contractors or vendors may access all of the information on your wireless device.. Service is limited to the operating range, spectrum, and capacity of our, or our roaming partners’, wireless system in your service area. Your Service area is the area depicted in the coverage map available to you when you activated Service and may change from time to time without notice. Since MetroPCS uses different spectrum in different areas of the country, service may not be available on all wireless devices in all areas. We may, but are not obligated to, provide notice when you are being served by a carrier other than ourselves. The specific network coverage you get will depend on the radio transmissions your wireless device can receive and use, and the Services you have chosen. Specific Services may not be available on all wireless devices at all points in time due to wireless device hardware and/or software, changes to our network, network infrastructure, cessation of specific Services, or service by carriers other than ourselves. Except for 911 calls and any "roaming" service to which you have subscribed, you will not be able to use your wireless device outside of your service area for any calls, including local, long distance and international calls. Further, since services outside MetroPCS' area are provided by third parties, not all services may work outside your service area. Service depends on over-the-air radio transmissions. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using Services outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage is not available everywhere and depends on the Service purchased and the wireless device used. Service speeds are not guaranteed and actual speeds will vary. Estimating wireless coverage, signal strength and Service speed is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that may result in dropped and/or blocked connections, slower Service speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of Service. Many factors beyond our control affect your ability to make and receive calls on your wireless device, the quality of those calls, and the speed of your Service including, but not limited to, your location, the conditions of the atmosphere, terrain, nearby buildings and other structures, network capacity issues, system outages, failure of equipment to operate as expected, spectrum used, problems that occur with service we purchase from third parties, system upgrades, performance of system maintenance, accidents, network problems, network or Internet congestion, software, signal strength, your wireless device, weather, geography, topography, server speeds of the websites you access or other events outside of our control. As a result, sometimes Service, including calls or attempted calls to emergency services like 911, may be unavailable, interrupted or may fail, and the quality of calls may sometimes be poor.. MetroPCS takes no responsibility for Service interruptions or problems caused by factors beyond our control. Any statements by MetroPCS, its employees, representatives or agents about the coverage of our system are intended only to describe MetroPCS' approximate coverage in your service area. You should not interpret any such statement to mean that Service will be available or without interruption in any service area.. Location Based Services; Important Emergency and 9-1-1 Information; and Emergency Alerts. When making a 911 call, always state the nature of your emergency and provide both your location and phone number, as the operator may not automatically receive this information.. MetroPCS is not responsible for failures to connect or complete 911 calls or if inaccurate location information is provided. 911 service may not be available or reliable and your ability to receive emergency services may be impeded.. Services that rely on location information, such as E911, GPS navigation, and our wireless network depend on your wireless device's ability to acquire satellite signals and network coverage. Unlike traditional wireline telephones, depending on a number of factors (for example, where you are, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their equipment, etc.), 911 operators may not know your telephone number, your location or the location of your wireless device. Other third party entities are involved in connecting a 911 call. MetroPCS makes no guarantee that emergency 911 calls will be routed to a specific Public Safety Answering Point ("PSAP") or any particular public safety organization (for example, police department, fire department, ambulance services, etc.). MetroPCS takes no responsibility for the acts or omissions of any PSAP or any public safety organization (for example, police department, fire department, ambulance services, etc.). In certain circumstances, an emergency call may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher or alternative location set by local emergency service providers. Enhanced 911 service ("E911"), where enabled by local emergency authorities, uses GPS or network technologies to provide location information. Even when available, however, E911 does not always provide accurate location information, and in some cases may not generate a location at all. If your wireless device is indoors or for some other reason cannot acquire a satellite signal, you may not be located. Some wireless devices have a safety feature that prevents use of the keypad after dialing 911. You should follow voice prompts when interacting with emergency service providers employing Interactive Voice Response ("IVR") systems to screen calls. While your wireless device is receiving a software update, you may be unable to use your wireless device in any manner until the software update is complete. If you are porting a phone number to or from us, we may not be able to provide you with some Services, such as 9-1-1 location services, while the port is in process. Your wireless device may require you to elect to use location based services, or you may choose to use location based services, other than E911. If you elect to use non-E911 location based services, you agree that we may use the location information transmitted from your wireless device to improve our location services. Your personal, biographical and calling information will not be used by us. By electing to use location based services, you agree and authorize us to send targeted, location based information to your mobile device and also to use or provide to third parties your location information in an aggregate form.. MetroPCS has chosen to offer wireless emergency alerts, within portions of its coverage area, on wireless alert capable Devices. There is no additional charge for these wireless emergency alerts. For details on the availability of this service and wireless emergency alert capable Devices, please visit https://www.metropcs.com/terms-conditions/wireless-emergency-alerts.html .. * Data Plans and Other Features. Depending on your Rate Plan, your usage of Data Access may be metered by Us. Your Rate Plan may include a Data Access usage limit, such as 2 GB per service cycle. We shall determine in our sole discretion what data usage constitutes Data Access and reserve the right to alter, make additions to or deletions to what type of data usage, or protocols, constitute Data Access without notification to you. Data Access may include, for example, multimedia streaming and video on demand services, as well as certain multimedia uploads, downloads and gaming services and applications. Uploads are data sessions where the data is transferred from your Wireless Device to some other computer or wireless device, while downloads are data sessions where the data is transferred from some other computer or wireless device to your Wireless Device. Depending on your Rate Plan, certain usages may not count against your Data Access limit. Data Access does not include any data services or uses which are prohibited by Us under this Agreement, such as in the MetroWEB Terms of Use. Data Access usage includes, but is not limited to, the actual data sent and received along with overhead, header packets, and may include other information sent in connection with a data session in which Data Access occurs. Data Access on networks not owned by us, such as when you are roaming, may not be available or may be further limited. Charges and availability are based on the location of the cell site receiving and transmitting the Data Access service and not your location.. The absolute capacity of the wireless data network is limited. Accordingly, Data Access is only provided for prescribed purposes and pricing for Data Access is device dependent and based on the transmit and receive capacity of each device. A Data Access pricing plan designated for one type of device may not be used with another device. Compatible data-enabled wireless devices are required.. You acknowledge and agree that your Data Access usage and speed may vary depending on certain factors outside of our control. Such factors may include the amount of users on the service, network congestion, the distance to the serving cell site, the number of users served by your serving cell site, the management of backhaul at the serving cell site, any application(s) you are using for your data session, the screen size of your Wireless Device, the bit rate(s) of your data session, the type(s) and amount(s) of compression used by the computers or wireless devices involved in the data session, and any error(s) that might occur in the data session. We also manage our network to facilitate the proper functioning of services that require consistent high speeds, such as video calling, which may, particularly at times and in areas of network congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services. Additionally, we may implement other network management practices, such as deploying streaming video optimization technology and prioritizing all Smartphone Mobile Hotspot (tethering) data below on-device data. This technology is intended to manage data usage on the network, reduce the risk of streaming video stalling and buffering, and reduce the amount of high-speed data consumption used for streaming video.. Streaming video optimization improves streaming video reliability as well as makes room for other users to enjoy higher browsing speeds.. The streaming video optimization process is agnostic as to the streaming video content itself and to the website that provides it.. While most changes to streaming video files are likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the streaming video as displayed on a user’s device. These practices operate without regard to the content itself or the source of the content, and do not discriminate against offerings that might compete against those offered by MetroPCS on the basis of such competition. In order to assess your usage during an applicable service cycle, you may obtain approximate usage information by using one of our automated systems. Any application on your Wireless Device which describes the amount of data usage does not necessarily reflect your usage of Data Access. We may provide a meter for your use in one or more locations accessible by you. Any meter provided for your use may deliver readings higher or lower than your actual Data Access usage, or deliver readings that are higher than your actual Data Access usage because of the units of measurement used by Us. Any reading delivered by any meter we provide for your use will have inherent inaccuracies and may not provide up to the minute or second accuracy. Further, any reading delivered by any meter We provide for your use may only be completely accurate if your Wireless Device is turned off and not transmitting or receiving any data from any data session.. MetroPCS reserves the right to manage our network and the traffic on our network in the way we believe best benefits our customers and best enables us to maintain Service of the nature described in this Agreement. We have determined that our ability to provide Service to our customers is disrupted when you place an abnormally high number of calls, repeatedly place calls which result in abnormally long call lengths, high or disproportionate use, or otherwise use our Services or network in excess of our expectations for the normal amount of use by our customers. Other examples of prohibited uses can be found in Section 17. If you use your service in a manner that could interfere with other customers’ service, affect our ability to allocate network capacity among customers or degrade service quality for other customers, we may suspend, terminate, or restrict your Service.. Some elements of multimedia messages may not be accessible, viewable, or heard due to limitations on certain wireless phones, PCs, or e-mail. We reserve the right to change the multimedia message size limit at any time without notification. Text message notifications may be sent to non-multimedia messaging subscribers if they subscribe to text messaging. You may receive unsolicited messages from third parties as a result of visiting Internet sites, and a per-message charge may apply whether the message is read or unread, solicited or unsolicited.. To differentiate the services we sell, at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, we give the data traffic of customers who choose T-Mobile-branded services precedence over the data traffic of customers who choose non-T-Mobile-branded services such as MetroPCS.. Where the network is lightly loaded, a MetroPCS customer will notice little, if any, effect from having lower priority. This will be the case in the vast majority of times and locations. At times and at locations where the network is heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, however, MetroPCS customers will likely see reductions in data speeds, especially if they are engaged in data-intensive activities. Customers on Rate Plans and Devices with 4G capability should, for example, be aware that these practices may occassionally result in speeds below those typically experienced on our 4G LTE and HSPA networks. MetroPCS constantly works to improve network performance and capacity, but there are physical and technical limits on how much capacity is available, and at constrained locations, the frequency of heavy loading in relation to available capacity may be greater than at other locations. When network loading goes down or the MetroPCS customer moves to a location that is less heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, the MetroPCS customer‘s speeds will likely improve. See www.metropcs.com/openinternet for details.. MetroPCS also reserves the right to restrict, or otherwise prevent access to services, countries, carriers, destinations that MetroPCS determines, in its sole discretion, are inconsistent with the nature of Service provided by MetroPCS, are indicative of uses not permitted hereunder, or result in abnormally long calls, or abnormally high usage. We also may block calls to telephone numbers at the request of the called party.. You can purchase Content and Applications (for example, downloadable, streaming or networked applications, wallpapers, ringtones, games, productivity tools and video) ("Content and Apps") for and with your compatible wireless device. Some Content and Apps that you can purchase with your wireless device are not sold by MetroPCS and for such Content and Apps, you can identify the third party seller at the point of purchase. MetroPCS is not responsible for such Content and Apps, including download, installation, use, transmission failure, interruption, or delay, or any content or website you may be able to access through the Content and Apps. Any support questions for such Content and Apps should be directed to the third party seller identified at the point of purchase. When you download or install any Content and Apps sold by a third party seller, you may be subject to license terms between you and the third party seller and Content and Apps creator/owner. When you use, install, display, run, or listen to Content and Apps that you purchase from MetroPCS, the Content and Apps are licensed to you by MetroPCS and may be subject to additional license terms between you and the creator/owner of the Content and Apps. Whether purchased from MetroPCS or a third party seller, any Content and Apps you purchase are licensed for personal, lawful, non-commercial use on your wireless device only. You may not transfer, copy, or reverse engineer any Content and Apps, or alter, disable or circumvent any digital rights management security features embedded in the Content and Apps. Content and Apps may not be transferable from one wireless device to another wireless device. You understand and agree that the Content and Apps contain the intellectual property of third parties. You understand and agree that the Content and Apps are protected by law (including copyright law) and are solely for your personal, non-commercial use. You agree to comply with all applicable laws (including copyright law), and may only make such copies as are reasonably necessary for your personal and non-commercial use. You agree that any other redistribution, reproduction, transmission, communication, sale, use (including, except in the case of Ringtones, as a "ringer" for a telephone), broadcast, public performance, rental or lending, adaptation, sub-license or other use of the Content and Apps without the prior written consent of the copyright owner is prohibited. You understand and agree that all rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by the applicable content owner.. Your location can be identified while using GPS applications. It is your responsibility to notify Authorized Users that their location can be identified while using GPS applications. If you use a third party application, the application may access, collect, use or disclose your personal information or require MetroPCS to disclose your information, including location information (when applicable), to the application provider or some other third party. If you access, use or authorize third party applications through the Services, you agree and authorize MetroPCS to provide information related to your use of the Services or the application(s). You understand that your use of third party applications is subject to the third party's terms and conditions and policies, including the third party's privacy policy. You agree that any Authorized User may access, use or authorize MetroPCS or third party location-sensitive applications through the Services. You understand that your use of such location-sensitive applications is subject to the application's terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy. If you activate location-sensitive services for wireless devices used by other Authorized Users, you agree to inform the Authorized User(s) of the terms of use for location-sensitive applications and that the wireless device may be located. For additional information on location-sensitive services, see our Privacy Policy at our website.. Your wireless device may connect to another provider’s network (“Off-Net”) even when you are within our service area. Our Services and Rate Plans are designed for you to use your Service each month predominantly using our networks. You must use your wireless device predominantly within the MetroPCS owned network coverage area. If your minutes of use, text messaging usage, or data usage are not predominantly on our networks ("Off-Net Usage"), or are excessive, abnormally high, or cause MetroPCS to incur too much cost, MetroPCS may, at its option and sole discretion, limit or terminate your service, deny your continued use outside the areas served by our network or on other carriers' coverage, or change your Rate Plan. MetroPCS will provide you with advance notice that it intends to take any of the above actions.. Nationwide roaming requires multi-band wireless devices and is not available with single-band wireless devices, certain other wireless devices, or to customers residing outside their home area. Data services and certain features (for example, Voicemail, Caller ID, Call Waiting, Location Services, etc.) may not be available in all roaming areas. The term "roaming" typically refers to coverage on another carrier's network that we may make available to you based on our agreements with other carriers. These agreements may change from time to time and roaming coverage and available services are subject to change without notice. Your ability to roam depends on the radio transmissions your wireless device can receive and use, and the availability of roaming coverage. We make no guaranty that roaming coverage will be available. Roaming coverage may exist both within and outside our network coverage areas. Depending on your Services, separate charges or limits on the amount of minutes used while roaming may apply. We may, but you agree we are not obligated to, provide you with notice when you are roaming. YOU AGREE TO HOLD METROPCS HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, ACTIONS, OR OTHER CAUSES OF ACTION (INCLUDING ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE SERVICE.. You agree to pay for all charges for Service ("Service Charges"), including, but not limited to the following: (1) recurring monthly or weekly access charges; (2) charges and taxes for optional Service features that you select, including long distance and directory assistance (411) calls and other optional features, such as ringtone downloads; (3) any Service reconnection charges that may apply, such as a reactivation fee; and (4) all applicable taxes and regulatory charges whether assessed directly on you or us; provided, however, that for certain tax inclusive Rate Plans, only applicable taxes and regulatory charges may be included in the Rate Plan price. You must pay all taxes, fees and surcharges set by federal, state and local governments. To determine taxes, fees and surcharges, we will use the street address you identified as your Place of Primary Use ("PPU"). If you did not identify the correct PPU, or provided an address that is not a recognized street address, such as a PO Box, does not identify the applicable taxing jurisdictions or does not reflect the Service area associated with your telephone number, you may be assigned a default PPU for tax purposes. You acknowledge and agree that a default PPU may affect your ability to receive E-911 assistance and you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any claims relating to your failure to provide a valid PPU. In addition, if you are not on a tax-inclusive plan, you agree to pay all regulatory administration charges ("Regulatory Administration Charges"), which may include, but are not limited to, Federal Universal Service, various regulatory charges, our administrative charges, gross receipts charges, margin taxes, and charges for the costs we incur in complying with governmental programs. Regulatory Administration Charges are not taxes and are not required by law. We set these charges, and the amounts and what they include may change without notice. They are rates we choose to collect from you and are kept by us in whole or in part. The number and type of Regulatory Administration Charges may vary depending upon the PPU of the wireless device and can change over time. We determine the rate for these charges and these amounts are subject to change as are the components used to calculate these amounts. Changes to taxes, fees and surcharges will become effective as provided by the taxing authority and changes to Regulatory Administration Charges shall be effective immediately. You are responsible for all Charges to your account, whether or not you were the user of the wireless device. If your wireless device gets lost or stolen, you agree to notify us immediately, so we can suspend your Service to prevent someone else from using it. After your Service is suspended, you will not be responsible for additional usage charges incurred in excess of your Rate Plan Charges, applicable taxes, fees, and Surcharges. If you request that we not suspend your Service, you will remain responsible for all usage, Charges incurred, and applicable taxes and fees. We may prevent a lost or stolen wireless device from registering on our and other networks. Wireless access to corporate/employee email may require additional server or server access, licenses, or additional requirements which may incur additional charges. By requesting wireless access to corporate/employee email, you agree to pay any of these additional charges.. Certain parties besides MetroPCS have the ability to place charges on your bill for their services. You may access these services and authorize the placement of charges on your bill through your phone or online account. MetroPCS also provides customers, at no additional cost, with the ability to restrict the placement of charges for third-party services on your account. Contact customer care at 1-888-8metro8 or go to. Service Charges must be paid in advance and are due before the first day of your service cycle. Service Charges cannot be paid in arrears. Unless otherwise specified in your Rate Plan, monthly service cycles are approximately 30 days long. The dates of your monthly or weekly service cycle and other dates related to your account may change from time to time. You must promptly notify us of any change in your billing address. As a convenience, you may authorize recurring payment of your Service Charges through a credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization; this authorizes us to charge all amounts you owe us to the credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization up to five (5) days prior to the due date and to demand immediate payment from the card or debit issuer or bank. Unless required by law, we will not give any additional notice to you or obtain additional consent from you before charging Service Charges to that credit or debit card. You must promptly notify us of any change in the credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization you want to use for payment. You may also make a payment by credit or debit card online at www.metropcs.com or through the automated MetroPCS IVR. In addition, you may pay your Service Charges by sending a check or money order by mail to P.O. Box 5119, Carol Stream, Illinois, 60197-5119, or by bringing cash, check, or money order in person to any MetroPCS store or authorized payment center. You may be required to pay an additional service charge, depending on the payment method you choose. This information is available at MetroPCS.com. In addition, we may charge an additional fee up to the maximum amount permitted by law for any check or other negotiable instrument tendered by you and returned unpaid by a financial institution for any reason. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to require that you pay your Service Charges with cash, certified check, cashier's check, or money order. We also reserve the right to report any check returned to us to reporting and credit agencies and law enforcement.. * Your right to Dispute Charges.. Your payment will be considered late if we do not receive it before the first day of the service cycle for which the payment is due. If you do not make all payments when they are due, you will be in default under this Agreement, and MetroPCS will be entitled to exercise any rights it may have under this Agreement, including the suspension or termination of Service to you. If we accept a late or partial payment, even if you mark the payment "paid in full," we do not waive our rights to suspend or terminate your Service or any other rights we may have. If your Service is terminated and you promptly pay amounts that are overdue, MetroPCS, in its sole discretion, may reconnect your Service after you have paid any reconnection fees we have imposed. In such case, your service cycle anniversary date will not change, which will result in fewer days of service for that month. If you have a dispute regarding the Charges to your account, or about the Services provided to you, you agree to notify us of the dispute within 60 days after the date you first receive the disputed Charge ("Dispute Period"), unless otherwise provided by law. If you do not notify us of your dispute in writing within the Dispute Period, you have waived such claim and will be forever barred and estopped from raising, or making a claim for such dispute and you may not pursue a claim in arbitration or in court. Unless otherwise provided by law, you must pay disputed Charges until the dispute is resolved. If you accept a credit, refund or other compensation or benefit to resolve a disputed Charge, you agree that the issue is fully and finally resolved and such credit shall act as an accord and satisfaction. In the event of a lost or stolen wireless device, for Charges incurred before you notify us, you are not liable for charges you did not authorize, but the fact that your wireless device or service was used is some evidence of authorization. You may request that we investigate Charges you believe were unauthorized. We may ask you to provide information and you may submit information to support your request. If we determine the charges were unauthorized, we will credit your account. If we determine the charges were authorized, we will inform you within 30 days and you will remain responsible for the charges.. You expressly consent to be contacted, by MetroPCS or anyone calling on its behalf, for any and all purposes, at any telephone number, or physical or electronic address where you may be reached, including any wireless telephone number. You agree that MetroPCS may contact you in any way, including, pre-recorded or artificial voice or text messages delivered by an automatic telephone dialing system, or e-mail messages delivered by an automatic e-mailing system. You agree that we also have the consent to contact any Authorized User on your account for Service or payment related reasons. Any such notice will be treated as provided to you when left with you, on your wireless device, on your answering/voicemail service, or by email or fax to any email or fax number you provided to us, or 3-days after mailing to your last known address as shown in our records. Your consent to be contacted may be revoked only if it is in writing and is with MetroPCS’s express agreement. You must notify us of any address changes. Failure to notify us of a change in your address constitutes a breach of this Agreement and grounds for possible suspension or termination of your Service. If you have any questions regarding your Service or information in this Agreement, you may contact our Customer Care department at. www.metropcs.com , by calling 1-888-8metro8, or by writing us at MetroPCS, P.O.
