more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Peter Kostadinov. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction Ever felt like importing a Chinese smartphone? In case you have, a quick research might have made you familiar with Meizu, a somewhat large China-based handset maker that rivals local superstar Xiaomi when it comes to bargain-priced devices. We have the Meizu M5 Note with us today, the company's latest 5.5-incher that pairs a not too shabby specs sheet with a rather aggressive pricing and seems like a great deal on paper. In China, you can get the base model for the local equivalent of roughly $130, which is a killer price. In Europe, the 16GB version of the phone will retail for 229 EUR, while the 64 gigabyte one will sell for 249 EUR. However, does this attractive proposition double as a great everyday device in real life? Secondly, is it worth going through all the hassle of importing that phone to the States? Let's find the answers to these questions! What's in the box: Meizu M5 Note Wall charger Micro USB cable Quick start booklets and SIM ejector tool Design The run-of-the-mill design doesn't impress, but the phone has a sturdy build While its design is a bit mundane and fails to excite on any level, the build quality is pretty good for a phone of that price range and makes it up for the lack of anything special going in terms of looks. The phone's solid metal body feels pretty sturdy in the hand and is a bit lighter than similarly-sized devices. All the hardware buttons—the volume rocker, the power and home keys—provide great feedback. We also love the fact that the camera at the back is not protruding outside of the body – it's actually ever so slightly recessed. The M5 Note has a multi-functional home button, which acts as a fingerprint scanner, a back button when tapped, and finally, a regular home button when clicked. You access your app switcher by swiping up from the bottom edge of the phone, which has allowed Meizu to go for a super minimalist button layout, with no capacitive or software navigation keys in sight. Display It's sharp enough, but cold and not that accurate The 5.5-inch full HD IPS-LCD display of the Meizu M5 Note is a mixed bag. We find it sharp enough yet we simply can't ignore the fact that it's far from perfect in terms of color reproduction. By default, the display is a bit cold, meaning that you'll notice colors being a bit more blueish than supposed to. That's easiest to see when looking at white. Luckily, you can tweak the color temperature of the display to your liking. The display is neither over-saturated nor overly vivid, but the color accuracy is far from perfect. For example, yellow colors appear way greener than they should be, while blues are much more prominent that they are expected to. We have to give credit where it's due – we were pleasantly surprised to notice that the display's gamma is pretty good. This means that the Meizu M5 Note has a very accurate contrast between the dark and bright areas of a given image.. 6.05 x 2.98 x 0.32 inches. 153.6 x 75.8 x 8.1 mm. 6.02 x 3.02 x 0.39 inches. 153 x 76.6 x 9.8 mm. 5.91 x 2.99 x 0.34 inches. 150 x 76 x 8.65 mm. 5.96 x 3 x 0.32 inches. 151.3 x 76.3 x 8.15 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Meizu M5 Note Compare.

The Meizu M5 Note is a smartphone designed and produced by the Chinese manufacturer Meizu , which runs on Flyme OS, Meizu’s modified Android operating system. It is the company's latest model of M series, succeeding the Meizu M3 Note. It was unveiled on December 6, 2016 in Beijing.. 2.2 Hardware and design. On October 31, 2016 Meizu officially launched the M5 in Beijing. Later in December, Meizu announced and unveiled the M5 Note, targeted at budget-conscious consumers looking for a decent mid-range device. Pre-orders for the M5 Note began after the launch event on December 8, 2016. Sales in mainland China began on December, 2016.. The M5 was released with Flyme OS version 5, [5] a modified operating system based on Android Marshmallow .. The Meizu M5 Note has a MTK6755M octa-core processor with an array of ten ARM Cortex CPU cores, an ARM Mali-T860 GPU and 3 to 4 GB of RAM LPDDR3 (depending of the version 16/32 or 64 GB). Unlike most other Android smartphones, the M5 Note has neither capacitive buttons nor on-screen buttons; the functionality of these keys is implemented using a technology which makes use of gestures with the home screen button, which also acts as a fingerprint sensor. The haptic technology that debuted on the Meizu M3, which allows the user to perform a different action by pressing the touchscreen instead of tapping, also features on the M5. The M5 Note has a 5.5-inch LTPS IPS LCD multi-touch capacitive touchscreen display with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels, and a pixel density of 403 ppi.. The device has a volume/zoom control and the power/lock button on the right side and a 3.5mm TRS audio jack. Like its predecessor, it uses USB Micro-B for both connectivity and charging.. The device has front and back cameras, with resolutions of 5 megapixels and 13 megapixels, respectively.. The M5 Note is available in four colours: champagne gold, silver, grey, and blue; and comes with either 16, 32 or 64 GB of internal storage.. The M5 Note received mixed reviews. Android Authority praised the Fingerprint sensor on the device, saying "There’s a fingerprint sensor below the screen that wakes up the device in 0.2 seconds and will keep your precious data safe." [6]. Digital Trends however commented on the timing and how the M5 Note was more of an upgrade stating "The peculiar thing about the M5 Note is it arrives less than a year after the M3 Note’s introduction, making it much more of an incremental upgrade than anything else." [7]. GSM Arena concluded that whilst featuring an attractive design, Meizu M5 Note was described as being less impressive than competitor devices, noting "everything about the phone is average, while the competition goes above and beyond the understanding of the term average." [8] Android Headlines also commented on the issue of LTE support, saying it should be carefully considered "If you live in a country where the Meizu M5 Note supports all of the bands that you need for LTE, then definitely." [9]. Phandroid commented that storage could be an issue saying "just as long as you opt for the 32GB models so you can install more than a few dozen apps before running out of storage."

Meizu M5 Note review: Do not buy this phone. 2017/01/18 9:15am PST Jan 18, 2017. 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design and materials 5 Camera 6 Performance 7 Software 8 Battery 9 Conclusion. It would be understandable if you have never heard of Meizu.. one of the top electronics companies in mainland China,. the company isn't massively popular outside of the country. The M5 Note is the newest device to come out of Meizu, and like many of its recent phones, is being sold internationally.. From the spec sheet, the M5 Note looks like a solid device. A Mediatek Helio P10 CPU, 1080p LCD screen, at least 3GB of RAM, a massive 4,000mAh battery. The price is perhaps most impressive, costing just 899 CNY for the base model - roughly $131 USD. For comparison, the Moto G4 Play with a Snapdragon 410, 720p display, and 2GB of RAM costs more at its regular price.. With great specifications at an incredibly low price, the M5 Note almost seems too good to be true. 13 MP Rear, 5 MP Front. The 1080p display is probably the best feature of the M5 Note. The built-in speakers are firmly in the 'good enough' category. There are countless issues with Flyme OS, starting with no Google services being installed by default. The poor implementation of Google Play Services causes the battery life to plummet, even with light use. I could not receive notifications through. Google Hangouts, among a few other apps. The M5 Note only has a MicroUSB port, not USB Type-C.. The M5 Note, as the name might imply, is a rather large phone. The device itself is roughly 154mm. tall, 75mm wide, and 8mm thick - almost identical in size to the Pixel XL and now-discontinued Galaxy Note7.. Besides the physical size, the first thing you might notice when holding the M5 Note is the weight. Whereas my Pixel is just 143 grams (5.04 oz), the. Note is 175 grams (6.17 oz). The extra weight is largely thanks to the included 4,000mAh battery, which I'll get to later. Overall, I didn't really mind the extra weight, but it is certainly noticeable compared to most flagship devices.. Aesthetically, the M5 Note seems closest to the iPhone 6S. It has the same reflective metal around the home button's edge, the same aluminum back, the same antenna bands, and so on. The speakers and headphone jack are in the exact same position as well.. This premium look and feel (even if unoriginal) seems out of place on a budget phone, and it's one of the M5 Note's best qualities.. That being said, the M5 Note is not a completely shameless copy. The large camera lens sits in the top center of the back casing, instead of the iPhone's top-left corner lens. Like most Android devices, the power button and volume rockers are on the same side. Annoyingly (or at least for me), the power button is positioned below the volume.. Perhaps the strangest design choice on the M5 Note is the navigation buttons - or rather, lack thereof. The home button, much like on the iPhone, serves as the only means of navigating through the operating system.. Pressing the button takes you to the home screen, swiping or tapping the button acts as the back button, and swiping up from the bottom of the display brings up recent applications. While this form of navigation is certainly bizarre, I got used to it fairly quickly. I would have preferred software navigation buttons, but I suppose it could be worse.. The M5 Note has two cameras - a 13 MP rear camera and a 5 MP front camera. Both are unexceptional, as should be expected for a phone at this price point. Outdoor shots with enough light are usually good, such as the first photo, but still appear washed out. Inside/low-light photos often appear blurry and unfocused,. even when capturing stationary objects with the M5 Note on a tripod.. With many budget devices, a good camera is often a low priority, and it certainly was with the M5 Note.. As you may have noticed in the table above, the M5 Note is powered by the. eight ARM Cortex A53 cores, clocked at 1.81GHz each. Graphics are handled by the Mali-T860 GPU, and depending on your model, the M5 Note has either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. There's also no USB Type-C port to be found - just microUSB.. On the Geekbench 4 CPU test, the Meizu M5 Note scores 696 for single-core performance and 2118 for multi-core performance ( full results here ). The single-core score is dreadful, comparable to the Samsung Galaxy S4 (679) and Neuxs 7 2013 (660). The multi-core score fares a bit better, ranking close to the OnePlus X (2088) and LG G3 (2142).. In day to day usage, I would describe the M5 Note as 'acceptable' in performance. Most apps do take a second or two to open, but overall the phone never felt bogged down or especially slow.. But what about games? Much like the CPU, the GPU is nothing to write home about. The 3DMark Sling Shot test running at 1080p with OpenGL ES 3.0 scored 498 ( full results here ). This places the phone alongside the LG Optimus G Pro. (488), LG Stylus 2 Plus (510), and Oppo R9 (494). This should be enough to power through most games, with my test of GTA San Andreas only dropping frames when setting visual effects to the max.. While I'm on the topic of hardware, let's talk band compatibility. Like many Chinese smartphones, the M5 Note does not support the LTE bands in the United States, and doesn't work at all on CDMA carriers like Verizon. On my Project Fi SIM card (only connecting to T-Mobile towers, since I'm using an unsupported device) I often switched between HSPA+ and 3G.. The Meizu M5 Note runs Flyme OS, the company's skinned version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. While the Note was originally announced to ship with Flyme OS 6 (still unfortunately based on Marshmallow), my review unit shipped with version 5.2.11.. As with many Chinese Android ROMs, Flyme OS. takes some visual cues from iOS. The notifications panel has a frosted glass background, the launcher doesn't have a separate app drawer, and so on. While I don't mind the overall design, it doesn't share much in common with Material Design.. However, Flyme OS seriously cripples this phone. The major problem is that the device ships without Google Mobile Services , which I consider essential to every Android device. GMS not only includes the Google Play Store, but also Google Play Services - essential for most Google applications to even work.. This may be acceptable in China, but with the M5 Note being sold internationally, this is a huge problem.. Instead of the Play Store, the M5 Note includes the non-descriptive "App Store" and "Hot Apps." The former seems to be a front-end for the sketchy 9APP repository , filled with unauthorized re-uploads from the Play Store and bootleg games. The latter is simply a list of recommended applications, with only an Install button for each item - you can't even view a description. Once you install an application, it vanishes from Hot Apps entirely.. Notice how I said the M5 Note. One of the many sketchy applications visible in 'Hot Apps' is an installer for Google services, which installs everything you need to get the Play Store and your favorite Google apps up and running. If you have ever flashed a gapps package on a custom ROM, this is the same basic concept.. However, there is one problem -. Meizu is not a GMS partner, which means they are not allowed to distribute Google's library of applications at all. As outlined by David , allowing users to install GMS on uncertified devices could lead to problems down the road.. So why does the M5 Note not have GMS installed by default? The most likely answer is that Meizu also ships phones with YunOS ( formally known as Aliyun ), which is not strictly Android-compatible. The terms for becoming a GMS partner dictate that the given OEM must not ship devices with incompatible forks of Android. So essentially, until Meizu stops selling YunOS devices, they would be. blocked from becoming a GMS partner.. Flyme OS has some other issues as well. writing this review, I was unable to change the wallpaper at all - with the error message asking me to "upgrade the system and try again." A recent system update later fixed this problem.. Perhaps as not much of a surprise, the M5 Note with GMS also fails SafetyNet, so you won't be playing Pokemon GO on. In addition, during my entire time using this device, I was unable to receive notifications for Hangouts (as well as two other apps). With it being my most-used communication tool, I had to keep my Google Pixel on-hand at all times to ensure I would receive important messages.. This is by far the most surprising aspect of this phone, and the primary reason why I cannot recommend the M5 Note to anyone. As explained in the Software section, the M5 Note. has not been approved by Google to run Google Mobile Services. Shortly after setting up the device, I used the Google Services installer to obtain the Play Store and related Google services, as I'm sure many other customers will do.. Thanks to Flyme OS not being certified for use with GMS, the Google Play Store absolutely tanks battery life on this phone. With a 4,000mAh battery, I was expecting at least a noticeable increase in battery life over my Nexus 5X. What I got instead was the worst battery life I have ever experienced on an Android device.. The Play Store regularly consumed 15-25% of my Note's battery in regular use, with Google Play Services always following closely behind. My typical workload on a phone consists of checking various social media applications, some searches and news reading in Chrome, and the occasional Netflix TV episode or short YouTube video. In the time I was able to stand using the M5 Note as my daily driver, I did not see more than three hours of screen-on-time.. You might have already scrolled down to leave a comment along the lines of "Corbin, why don't you just uninstall GMS? Then the battery issue would be solved." And while you might be right,. I don't consider Android phones without the Play Store or Google Play Services to be usable at all. Searching on F-Droid for long-abandoned alternatives to my favorite applications is not a very. The Meizu M5 Note, put simply, is a bad phone. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, especially at this price point, but the annoyances are not worth the savings.. The poor implementation of Google Play Services, the awful battery life, the sketchy included app store, buggy skin, and issues with notifications make the M5 Note unusable as a phone for me - I would take my first-gen Moto G over this any day.. While this is clearly designed for the Chinese market, hence the microUSB port and lack of support for US LTE bands, this still has many more problems than other Chinese-aimed smartphones do.

Since Type C became the port flagships began using. Because I've already switched over all of my chargers to Type C connectors, this would be firmly in the "con" category - I won't purchase a device without Type C.. I switched to type C way back in 2015. But that's the only device I have which has type C.. And I also switched over to type c with my 6P. Doesn't change the fact that the next device you or I get will most likely have Type C.. USB Type C is quickly becoming mainstream. It's time to ditch Micro USB. I switched over to type C when I purchased my 6P.. USB Type-C is still rare on Chinese Android devices, outside of flagship devices. It's understandable, much like the lack of LTE bands for America, but still a bit annoying.. Here in India, a budget phone which is around 250$ are coming up with type C, fingerprint reader and they put the VoLTE feature in bold letters (because it's a new thing) and sell it. I feel type C hasn't grown much. Even the PC are taking such a long time to get them on board.. The sad truth is, besides flagship phones in the US/Europe, not many devices use USB Type-C yet. Pointing this as a "con" is just misleading, specially for a sub-$200 Chinese smartphone.. Since having a 3,5 mm audio jack on your phone is literally making you Hitler.. I don't think anyone even consider buying a Meizu phone in the first place.. Since when having headphone jack count as a con? :3. When did he say headphone jack is a con?. When Apple (not Lenovo) decides you can't have it.. Who would even consider a phone meant for the Chinese market anyway? Is it even available in Europe?. Yes, Meizu officially sells its phones online (including the M5 Note) in China, India, Israel, Europe, Brazil, and New Zealand: https://www.meizu.com/en/wheretobuy.html. I don't think a non-GMS Android phone will sell outside of China or India but good try Meizu. What about people who purposely don't want Google services? They're in a minority, but they still exist based on what I see on Reddit and XDA.. Although it's not worth it for companies to bring their devices to the market just for this minority of users.. I can think of better phone options than this one could put a custom ROM on it without GApps. Regardless, my understanding is Meizu is a company actually trying to produce phones that will SELL WELL outside of China. This is NOT the way to go about it especially considering the questionable legality of the device itself.. And yeah, the things which Corbin mentioned in the article about what this phone does are just fishy.. Those people are usually tech-savvy users which are more than able to install a custom ROM without flashing GApps.. Besides, then they can have a great phone. Someone like that buying a phone like this just to not have GApps is laughable.. Designing a phone to sell specifically to minorities (I mean in term of numbers, not race, so don't get sensitive) and rom flashers only is a strange marketing plan. Saying you can flash a rom to a phone to make it functional is a really bad excuse, especially when roms have issues which they usually do.. Meizus sold in Europe from the official source have Google services! I made a friend buy a M2 Note like 2 years and she's super happy with that :). My understanding is Meizu is NOT A GSM PARTNER so if they are selling a phone with Google services on it the legality of it is in question. I assume you mean by an official source you are talking about a re-seller. They are known to to slap unofficial ROMs on Meizu phones.. It's cool she likes it but personally I don't buy knockoff products.. I didn't read that article in particular before. Those I was talking about are not resellers, but "official stores" that are indicated on their european website. BTW, as they state on their specs list on those "official stores" there's a pretty straightforward line affirming that phones are coming with the Play Store preinstalled (as you can see below)... It doesn't seem really correct then. Indeed there wouldn't be any play services issues if you actually buy it from an official seller instead of some shady reseller that installs outdated gapps, adware and some mystery meat on it.. I'm getting the impression that Corbin isn't a fan of the Meizu M5 Note.. Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !ud328c:. On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. It sounds unbelievable but you wont forgive yourself if you don’t check it. I hope Chinese phones get way more popular in the West just so I wouldn't have to read "It's understandable if you haven't heard of this company" in the beginning of every single review about one of them.. Except that most Chinese OEMs will never reach that accomplishment.. Sure, but there's two or three that stand out. Xiaomi is definitely one of them, Meizu is/was on the verge.. I hope that they do not become more popular because they are bringing a lot of very bad Hardware with corrupted software and almost no security to these markets and they price them so cheap that people buy them because they don't know any better. I would much rather that they focus on putting out some quality devices and actually getting them up to par on the software and security front prior to releasing anything in the US.. >very bad Hardware with corrupted software and almost no security. You buy cheap shit, you get cheap shit. Get a decent Xiaomi, flash your non-MIUI ROM of choice, and you've got yourself a great phone. Xiaomi Mi5 (not Mi5s) is currently a steal at ~230-250$, it's a sick 2016 flagship.. Even Xiaomi's bottom of the line is pretty good.. LeEco phones are better value, saying it as happy owner of two Xiaomi or Zuk 2 is steal as well. Id say it's hard to go wrong with a redmi pro from xiaomi. that's a nice phone for the $ & you get amoled. Meizu are like a samsung 2nd. Id rather buy an older or refurbed samsung & get the real thing. Meizus problem is explained above making it just like umi. At least meizu is going back to samsung & mtk now for their soc. Alright, I won't get into the bad hardware part because it's simply not true for any of the top Chinese OEMs, and into corrupted software because I'm not sure what that even is, but it's funny how you talk about "almost no security" when Xiaomi has the best track record for updates and security patches from any OEM.. Xiamoi is beating Google and Blackberry? I didn't know that. But Xiaomi aside, it's only been about 10 weeks since we were reading about OEMs letting third parties access and modify their low level firmware, which resulted in back doors being created. The excuse was "it is used for customer service" and it impacted at least 2 OEMs.. Even on budget devices like my Redmi Note 2 they currently have the January patch level.. Those backdoors were found on none of the popular Chinese OEM. Not Xiaomi, or Huawei, or Oppo, or OnePlus, or Lenovo and Motorola.. Do you have a source for that? First time I hear about Huawei having the backdoor.. Android Police and others from circa Nov 15th. lol none of those are actually verified data. even the source has not been verified by an independent 3rd party. want to know some verified ones? google for CarrierIQ. this californian company implemented backdoors into phones from apple, samsung, HTC, LG, RIM, AT&T, Sprint, Verizon. still think you are safe from these known brands? ha.. Carrier IQ logs information about your whereabouts as well as other personal data such as browsing history, application usage and phone numbers.. Carrier IQ users are unaware of the software's existence, as it runs hidden in the background and doesn't require authorized consent to function. From a permissions standpoint -- with respect to Android -- the software is capable of logging user keystrokes, recording telephone calls, storing text messages, tracking location and more. It is often difficult or impossible to disable.. Thankfully every phone I've ever bought has been immune to it.. I did a search and found no keyword about Huawei in the main article at all. ZTE and BLU, however, are on the list. Huawei is definitely on the better side in terms of quality and security control than those companies. I didn't find anything about Huawei on those lists.. I read one that mentioned huawei, zte & others. It was definitely there.i remember thinking what nexus lovers would think? I mean i don't think it makes too much difference if china or sth korea have my info.as if samsung don't sell off our info? It's just the other doors that can potentially be opened leave you vulnerabie on cheaper chinese phones. That's true, I own the Redmi note 4 and I got the security patch for 1.1.2017 a week ago! And the phone is perfect without any bugs that I noticed so I'm happy especially because the phone was so cheap 😀. not sure where are you from but Huawei and Lenovo are HUGE in Europe, followed by Asus and few other brands. something like HTC is pretty much unknown since nobody buy it, heck even Sony would be dead if not for subsidizing with contracts. Hmm not sure if I should buy this or not, review was unclear on that.. He basically told that it's not worth because it's not GMS partner so, you install the google apps with a third party and it may not work well and drain the battery... It's cheap, but maybe you can find some better options with little more money like a Xiaomi and wont have problems with the Gapps. they recommend it since only thing they found can be easily fixed by installing clean custom ROM. This phone has a Mediatek SoC, so custom ROMs will likely never happen for this.. Exact same thought every time I read specs on a new device.. Well, it seems an android review made by an IPHONE fan... Not entirely sure how you came to that conclusion.. It is when you do a review seeing mostly what a thing does not do, instead of what it does... "OMG, where is app store? i dont like it.. "OMG, I cant deal with so many tweaks, roms... Design? Meizu had "iphone" design before apple. Play Store? Camon, it is a chinese phone, there is no play store there... AND you can easily install gapps.. This is a LOW PRICE PHONE, by a good brand... so, a good review could see all the good things the device has... My last iPhone was an iPhone 3G.. You approached the cellphone with a heavy load.. "While this is clearly designed for the Chinese market, hence the microUSB port". Many including corporations still use XP and IE6.. I guess, but you're not going to find many Type C phones at that price point in any country, not just China. Besides, China had the first USB C phone in the world.. Correct on the first part, but my Corp finally upgraded to Win7 about 2 years ago.. As I mentioned in another comment, Type-C on phones/tablets is still rather rare in China, besides on some flagship devices.. ummm, yeeeaah, USB-C isnt even common here in the US. Sure its going to start being adopted by remind me again why I should care? I have a SGS7E. and that comes with a microusb? you telling me my phone is an absolute piece of ****??. have you not read, some foreign countries/companies are suing google bevause they feel google play services are a monopoly, forcing others from not being able to install their apps. Sure, google apps are badass but if this doesnt even work eith LTE in the US, im guessing they dont really care if they sell like hotcakes here or not.. also, arent people always bitching that they want a bare stock experience? sure this is a crappy ios clone ripoff, but at least they have a starting base point for less apps.. and as for the camera, if people are willing to sacrifice quality and use a camera phone for everything, surely they dont care about its quality. i care, so i bought a Canon 80D and I have an expensive lens that isnt the crappy lens kit.. China had the first USB C phone to begin with and plenty new mid rangers have it.. "There are countless issues with Flyme OS, starting with no Google services being installed by default". "The poor implementation of Google Play Services causes the battery life to plummet, even with light use.". I am confused with this statement. the implementation is poor because it is uncertified and not optimized. Yes, but you can't say battery life is bad due to installing an application that the manufacture intended to not be installed on (not certified). If no Google services are installed on it, then installing it manually and giving poor review for battery life just doesn't make sense to me. Thats like me installing facebook on my Moto G and giving the phone a bad review because Facebook eats my battery.. yes you can because they have a GMS installer app EXPLICITLY to CIRCUMVENT GMS certification while still making GMS apps "available". Well that is an interesting way of implementing. Fair enough, but the review correctly implies that an Android phone meant to be sold internationally (where Google services are used, unlike China) should be pre-optimized at least enough to not have battery life decimated after many users predictably install Google services on their Android phone.. Maybe when/if TWRP becomes avaliable to this phone, OpenGApps can be flashed? I mean, at least I think that their installation of GMS would work better.. It's an MTK SoC, so I would not hold my breath.. "And while you might be right, I don't consider Android phones without the Play Store or Google Play Services to be usable at all. Searching on F-Droid for long-abandoned alternatives to my favorite applications is not a very enjoyable experience.". Corbin, a rhetorical question: what about Amazon Appstore?. Actually it's a crappy review since an original Meizu phone would never ship with google services. So reviewing it based on something it doesn't have is kinda odd.. The reseller probably installed the google services before he shipped the device and used some crappy outdated gapps package and didn't check if any other modifications are necessary for gapps to work properly. And to complete the party the reseller probably added some adware for fun :P. The Meizu OS skin is actually pretty nice in my opinion, it's very different from stock indeed but there's great attention to detail and has some interesting additions.. And this is a budget Meizu device from around $100 so it's obviously has a Mediatek soc, compared to high end Meizu phones with an Exynos soc.. The phone was sent as a review unit from Meizu, not a reseller.. Factory reset the phone and install Google services again. Also, make sure that you have the lastest firmware installed. I have owned several Meizu phones and every one of them had great battery life (with Google play installed).. Why do you even review non Google devices?. I already know AndroidPolice people is gonna shit on it, you guys are a joke.. Crap article based off a review unit.. Buy it from AliExpress and basically everything you read in this article is crap.. Got mine a week ago and it's running flyme 6.0 with google services pre installed - via the seller. Haven't had a single crash or issue in the week I have owned it.. Battery life is on par with my 7 plus and get 2 days out of it.. Two friends of mine own the thing and they have nothing but great things to say. Amazing battery life even with the GMS installed and amazing performance for the price. Try another unit before you bash the product for flaws that not everyone has.. Meizu probably didn't pay AP enough this time.. Only if they was judging the other OEMs that are releasing phones with problems and lack of updates... ! But of course liking Google's a** pays the bills I guess.. My Meizu M1 note is still going strong after nearly 2 years of abuse. The battery still endures 1 day easily. I usually do web browsing 3-4-5 hours a day. Still 40-50% of battery left when I plug to charger at night. LG G3 could not hold charge that long. My wife's redmi note2 as well does not hold charge that long after 6-7 months. They have similar capacity battery of 3000 mAh. Flyme is brilliant if you are used to. I find it easier and quicker to use than usual android 3 buttons in LG and Xaiomi. I do not need to use power button at all. Google play installation is a breeze. I use Google Now as home screen so I do not have all the app icons on the screen. I got bored and bought mi max last month. It is too big and not very practical for daily use. Now I switched back to my M1 note.. No Google services is a great fucking thing. That should be the selling point.. "With a 4,000mAh battery, I was expecting at least a noticeable increase in battery life over my Nexus 5X"...."I did not see more than three hours of screen-on-time". Well, I don't know if there's something wrong with my Nexus 5X, but I've NEVER got more than 3 hours of screen-on time. It's usually just 2.5 h :(. sot depending on your pattern of use, preferred network (wifi/lte) and so on. Greater improvement I got after reflashing to custom ROM.. Have you considered that the google apps you installed from this questionable & unofficial source might be maliciously modified & that is whats draining the battery like mad?. As mentioned in the article and another comment, the GMS installed is made by Meizu, was found the in the Meizu-developed 'Hot Apps', and was recommended for use to us by a Meizu representative. It's as official as it gets, unfortunately.. Oh, I missed the part of "former" in the article, I just read it as both pointing to a sketchy third party.. I think most of your problems are caused by the GMS, including the battery problem. Moreover, no Qualcomm SoCs, mostly MTK with weak graphics, always locked bootloader so no any custom ROMs, no FM-radio, no IR remote and so on compared to his rival Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro based on Snapdragon 650 with stronger performance and battery life.. It's nice seeing reviews of devices from chinese manufacturers. Considering this author's background with development, it would be nice to also see a personal note at the end of the article, regarding 3rd party development support of the device.. It should run all Android 6.0-compatible apps.. god what I would give to have this skin or at least make my nexus 5 look like this. I don't give a shit if it look like an iphone clone or something, I find it to be one of the prettiest looking skins of android. It's just so clean and slick. Yeah I know the software itself is crap, but they can improve!. Yeah, the UI itself isn't half bad. Certainly better than some of the other skins I've seen.. I wouldn't dare signing in to my main Google account on that phone. Did you (I suppose you did)?. Shame that the reviewer had such a bad experience with this phone. I have tried two Meizu phones in recent years - the budget M2 Note and the Pro 5. The former came with a global ROM so had no Chinese apps. I had no problems with this phone, great battery life although the SOC was a bit laggy and the screen was a fingerprint magnet. However, the Pro 5 was a real flagship. Still I had to install Google services myself and the installed apps were all in Chinese and I got some Chinese notifications occasionally. But it was speedy and had fantastic battery life, plus no problems with anything. One thing I really loved about both these phones was the one-touch on the home button to go back so no need for a separate back button. And you could swipe up from the bottom to show recent apps, very convenient. (Lenovo's Zuk phones work in a similar way). I generally like Meizu phones, my only wish is that they would stop using underwhelming Mediatek processors. Now that they have resolved their differences with Qualcomm maybe we will see some improvement in this area.. The problem with notifications happens with my meizu M3 (a.k.a Meizu m3 mini) and M3s, they dont appear until you open the app (whatsapp, as a example). I have the same problems you described (Im brazilian, imported my phones from aliexpress). Pokemon go runs on my M3s (with log in problens) but dont work on M3 mini. The notification problems seems "better" when i uninstalled Gapps, but that F***** my experience with the phones... I have had problems with whatsapp notifications on both Meizu M2 Note and Meizu Max. But I managed to fix both of them. On M2 Note I rooted the phone and uninstalled security manager. On Meizu Max I whitelites whats app in the battery and ram settings and disabled linked launch is settings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEeMTnFk0Ns. I consider myself a Meizu fan after purchasing MX6 last year. A year before that I got myself Nexus 5x (small upgrade from Nexus 5), all I can say is, Ive never been more impressed. But, I had to get rooted, extract opengapps and placed all the googliess apk manually because flashing the gapps zip files can be a bit tricky.. Right now it feels very good.. so your only complaint is that you don't know how to install custom ROM? because i don't see any provided reason why to not buy this phone in article besides complaining that you are lazy to replace ROM with clean custom ROM like Lineage. I don't think custom roms is available for M5 Note but the newest firmware version is available here (both Flyme 5 Stable and Flyme 6 Beta): https://forum.meizufans.eu/category/144/meizu-m5-note. Countless people use this phone with Google Play and no battery life problems at all. You either got a defective unit or something went wrong with Google Play on your device. Factory reset the phone and install Google Play again. When it comes to missing notfications, I am sure that you can solve this issue by tweaking the power management settings.. This may sound crazy but..does anybody here have an android phone they need to get rid of?..wouldn't mind sending it to Africa. I am enthusiastic about but phones here aren't that affordable, not especially for people in school.. Wow a really good review!! Have you seen the agm a2?. "Disclaimer: Since Meizu is not a registered Google Services partner, the international M5 Note comes without Google's services preinstalled. Instead, the phone gives you access to an installer which installs them for you hassle free. Other reviewers have been pointing out that these, essentially sideloaded, Google apps and services drain the battery faster than usual, but we assure you this behavior was only found on the reviewers units, which were sent out running an earlier pre-production version of the ROM. With the latest software build we've been enjoying great battery life." - GSM Arena. Android Police = no Google implementations? don't buy it!!. I've seen and read most of your reviews, and your reviews are misleading and bashing against chinese phones. Don't pretend every Android user uses the full suite of Google apps because i can tell you, this is not the case even in many countries in EU.. Is this website working under Apple's sponsorship? I am using m5 note and device has no battery or performance issues. This is a cheap middle level phone. This put simply, is a bad review. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but the annoyances are not worth the reading... First of all, you cannot compare the weight of a 5.5" budget phone to a 5.0" flagship device. The Google Picel XL which has thas the same screen size weights only 7 grams less. I own a Meizu phone with Flyme OS and it definitely does not cripple the phone. It actually runs smooth and GMS work completely fine. Review a unit that is not designated for the chinese market and you will not have these problems.... Nice post http://www.selfcarinsurance.com 4. i dont know where you got this fast battery drain bla bla bla.. ive been using this phone a couple of months and it could survive a day and a half for moderate usage.. your review is inaccurate plus its charging speed is impressive even without usb type c.. you can go from 0% - 100% in 60 minutes.. and it has its own playstore if u want dl googleplay its just few clicks away... I agree, M5 it's a terrible Phone, we got one as freebee and it's terrible, the Navigation is the worst as there is is no back button, you get stuck on certain applications like videos on Facebook and can't go back, even using the home button does not work..And no Google Play or Services.. It's never a phone I would buy. I have an Old Lenovo A 7000 and it's miles better.. Go for the new Lenovos, they have great write ups... Corbin Davenport is absolutely correct, this phone is the worst I have ever used, the lack of navigation buttons is inexcusable.. But there are many faults, the phone looks good but it's like new car with no Engine under the bonnet... I have this one for some time now (more than 6 months) and I would recommend it. It is a good phone if you ask me.. Who knew the world had dual-boot Apple/Google fanboys? And just as predictably boring and vapid as I would have thought....

February 9, 2017 - Written By Alexander Maxham. Highlight – Meizu brings a compelling package in the M5 Note, at a very low price. Meizu seemingly has a smartphone in just about every product category and every price range. The M5 Note is pegged as one of their cheaper models, but it still has quite a few tricks up its sleeve. The 32GB model (which is what we have) is about 999 Yuan, and that converts to around $145 USD, which makes it one of the cheaper smartphones on the market. But how does it stack up? Let’s find out.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. Meizu, like many other manufacturers out of China, have opted to stick with a full HD panel on their smartphones, and they’ve done that again here with the Meizu M5 Note. There’s a 5.5-inch 1080p panel here which equates to about 403 pixels per inch. Powering the smartphone is the MediaTek Helio P10 processor. This is an octa-core processor with four 1.8GHz Cortex-A53 cores and four 1GHz Cortex-A53 cores. This is paired with the Mali-T860MP2 GPU along with either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. There are three storage models, 16GB and 32GB options come with 3GB of RAM and then the 64GB model comes with 4GB of RAM. There is also a micro SD card slot that supports up to 256GB of additional storage.. When it comes to the camera, there is a 13-megapixel sensor on the backside of the Meizu M5 Note. This sensor has an aperture of f/2.2, phase detection autofocus, and dual-LED flash. The front-facing camera is a 5-megapixel shooter with an aperture of f/2.0. There is also a non-removable 4000mAh battery inside powering the show with Android 6.0 Marshmallow and Flyme 5.2 (Meizu’s own user interface).. Meizu doesn’t offer a whole lot of goodies in the box with the M5 Note, which is pretty much expected since the device does cost just under $150 USD. But there is a SIM ejection tool, the necessary paperwork that comes with any smartphone, and then the wall adapter and a micro USB cable, since the Meizu M5 Note does indeed use a micro USB connector instead of a USB-C port.. Meizu released quite a few smartphones in 2016, and for the most part they all looked pretty similar. The M5 Note does look quite a bit different, but it does still share a lot of the design aspects of other products they released last year, like the Meizu PRO 6, MX6 and others. One of the big changes is the sides of the device. Instead of being slightly curved, the Meizu M5 Note has flat sides, which may have given them more room for a bigger battery inside, seeing as the M5 Note’s battery is much larger than the PRO 6 which is one of the company’s more powerful devices, but not their flagship, that title belongs to the Meizu PRO 6 Plus. It does still fit comfortably in the hand, and that’s largely due to the fact that the display is only 5.5-inches. Another change here is the antenna lines. On the PRO 6 and MX 6, the antenna lines were basically the same as the iPhone 7 (which came out months later). This time around, the antenna lines are closer to the edge, and are straight. They still look fairly minimal, but also still exist.. Another change, and it’s one many people will like, is the fact that the camera no longer sticks out. The camera now sits flush with the back of the M5 Note, which is likely another thing that helped Meizu cram a larger battery inside. The overall feel of the M5 Note is actually very comfortable. Despite the device still boasting a pretty large top and bottom bezel on the front, the device is still pretty compact. Meizu did also opt to keep the 3.5mm headphone jack – which is located on the bottom of the device and is to the left of the micro USB port with the speaker on the other side.. The power button is on the right side, and is just below the volume rocker, both of which are in a great position. Making it easier to use either button with ease, and not worry about readjusting your grip on the Meizu M5 Note to actually turn down the volume or even power off the phone. When it comes to build quality, there really isn’t a whole lot to complain about here with the Meizu M5 Note. It’s a very subtle looking device, it’s not showing off anything crazy, like some other phones. And it has all of the necessities too, like a headphone jack and a big battery.. Many people believe that 1080p displays belong on a mid-range smartphone these days. Well, this is a mid-range smartphone, but Meizu also uses Full HD panels on their flagships. The difference is that on devices like the PRO 6, Meizu uses an AMOLED display, instead of an IPS like here on the M5 Note. The M5 Note’s display might not be as good, but for people looking for a cheap device, it’s still more than good enough. At 403 pixels per inch, it’s slightly lower than a good number of other devices out there, like the Huawei Mate 9, but by using a lower-resolution display it means that performance is even snappier and battery life is even better.. The display here isn’t perfect on the Meizu M5 Note, but it is pretty good. It may not win any awards for being the best display, but during our time with the device, we really had no complaints with the quality of the screen. Sure blacks could have been a bit darker, but that is also one of the advantages to using an AMOLED panel over an IPS. One of the big issues that we see with smartphones in this price range is with the digitizer. For those that might be unaware, the digitizer lives under the display and it is basically what tells the device that you touched the display, and where you touched it. In cheaper devices, the digitizer is often of lower grade and has issues with response. Resulting in lag and sometimes just not registering your touches at all. But with the Meizu M5 Note, that is not a problem at all. In fact, when it came to lag, we had no issues with it.. The Helio P10 is a pretty unknown processor in the West, but it’s pretty popular over in Asia. Many manufacturers use it in their mid-range devices. it’s basically like a Snapdragon 600-series processor, when it comes to performance. Paired with the Mali-T860MP2 GPU, it does offer some rather impressive performance, on a smartphone that is as cheap as the Meizu M5 Note. We’ve been using the M5 Note for about a week as our daily driver, and other than a few slow-downs, the device kept up with heavy usage all week-long. Obviously you’ll notice some differences coming from a device with a high-end processor like the Snapdragon 820, but that’s to be expected, since this is a slower clocked processor. The Helio P10 performed pretty well in day-to-day usage, it really only suffered in gameplay, which even then, it did pretty well.. While the Helio P10 did suffer in gameplay, it was mostly only in high-end games with loads of high-end graphics. Occasional games will work just fine here. With 3GB of RAM, there is also plenty of space to keep all of your favorite apps and games open in the background. We never actually needed to clear our recents for more RAM. Which is something that is common on every smartphone, even those with less RAM, and that is due to the fact that Android handles RAM really well these days.. The performance on the Meizu M5 Note isn’t the best, but you’re not paying for top-notch performance here, so the M5 Note isn’t really for heavy users (unless that doesn’t include gaming). The M5 Note is more geared towards those that don’t need a smartphone to do everything under the sun, and want to save some cash. The Helio P10 and 3GB of RAM (or even 4GB if you go with the higher-end model) is going to be perfect for most people, and definitely shouldn’t be a deal breaker.. Meizu has been using their physical home button as their fingerprint sensor for a few years now. Their home button is actually an all-in-one button. It acts as a back button, home button and fingerprint scanner. The fingerprint scanner is just as fast as you would expect from Meizu. You don’t really notice any delay, but if you are using another device – particularly a Huawei device who are known for having blazing fast fingerprint sensors – you may notice a difference. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate. Additionally, since the Meizu M5 Note does run on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, it does also support the Fingerprint API that Google debuted. So you are able to authenticate yourself in apps that have support for that API. This includes using your fingerprint in the Google Play Store instead of typing in your password.. Here on the M5 Note, you’ll notice that the speaker is on the bottom of the device, beside the micro USB port. This isn’t the most ideal position for a speaker, but it has become the norm in the smartphone industry. This is largely because manufacturers are wanting to make phones with larger screens, but not a larger footprint. Which leads to making bezels as small as possible. That also means that putting speakers on the front of the device is pretty difficult. And having one on the back isn’t a great idea either. So many are putting theres at the bottom of their device. It’s a pretty good position, since you can still hear the sound, even if the device is sitting on a desk.. Now the actual quality from the speaker isn’t all that great. It is definitely loud, but there are times where it can sound a bit tinny. Now, we’ve found in our time testing out this device that if you turn down the volume just a tiny bit, the sound actually sounds much better. And it’s still plenty loud, in most environments. Of course, the lows aren’t as bassy as you might expect from most smartphones in 2017, but it’s still more than capable. Let’s also not forget that there is a 3.5mm headphone jack here, so you can plug in some good headphones and get some great sound too.. Just as a disclaimer here on this review, the Meizu M5 Note does not support 4G LTE networks in the US. That goes for most smartphones that are made for the Chinese market. We did get some time on 3G and HSPA+ networks on T-Mobile, but no 4G LTE. Which is to be expected, even if it is a bit of an annoyance. Having said that, the network connection seemed to have performed about as we had expected it too. It wasn’t as fast as T-Mobile’s LTE network is, but HSPA+ is still mighty fast. WiFi also performed the same as it has on other devices that we’ve used.. When it comes to phone calls, the Meizu M5 Note worked as expected. It was able to make phone calls, it didn’t drop any, and users on the other end said that we were nice and clear. Not HD Voice clear, as that is not supported on the M5 Note, but still pretty clear which is still important. The Meizu M5 Note also does not support VoLTE, at least in the US.. Bands supported by the Meizu M5 Note include:. FDD LTE 800, 850, 900, 1800, 2100, 2600. On the Meizu M5 Note, we ran three benchmarks. These included AnTuTu, 3D Mark, and Geekbench 4. On AnTuTu, the device scored a 45,126 which was low enough to keep it in last place. Over on Geekbench 4, it scored a 687 in the single-core test and a 2129 in the multi-core test. Finally, over on 3D Mark it. Keep in mind that this is a mid-range smartphone, so these are mid-range scores. You can check out the full score results in the gallery below.. The Meizu M5 Note has a pretty large battery, along with a very efficient SoC and a 1080p display. All of these ingredients make for some incredible battery life, and that is exactly what we got out of the M5 Note during our time reviewing the device. However, Meizu’s Flyme OS has messed around with the battery stats reporting (this isn’t new actually), so when going into the settings to check your stats, you can only set it for a specific time-frame – 3, 6, or 12 hours – instead of the entire battery cycle from the minute you unplugged it. Which means that the screenshots below don’t show the entire battery cycle, in fact most of them don’t even show half of them, since this phone does regularly last about two days on a single charge.. Due to the way battery stats are reported here, it’s tough to say how many hours on screen you can get with this device, but our guesstimate would be around 6-8 hours of on-screen time. Which is pretty good, considering our usage included loads of YouTube videos, using Snapchat (which is notoriously bad at sucking battery power) and more. For a smartphone with a 4000mAh battery, it actually performed better than I had expected. I might even say that it performed better than the Huawei Mate 9, which has the same size battery, although it does have a slightly larger display.. The big downside to having a large battery in a smartphone, is charging it. Luckily, most smartphone makers are now including a form of fast charging or quick charge (even if they aren’t using a Qualcomm chipset) into their devices. Making it easy to charge up these large batteries, faster than ever before. But not with the Meizu M5 Note. It charges at a normal speed. And since it does last so long, I only plugged it in at night, and by the time I wake up, it’s fully charged. So there’s no real complaints here, but it wouldn’t hurt to add in some form of fast charging into devices like the M5 Note.. When it comes to software, our review unit of the Meizu M5 Note is running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, Flyme 5.2.11 OG and the October 5th, 2016 security patch, at the time of writing this review. Which means every aspect of this software is out of date. Meizu should have Flyme 6 on the Meizu M5 Note, but it’s not surprising that they don’t, considering their newest flagship the PRO 6 Plus doesn’t even have the update just yet. That is definitely something that Meizu needs to work on, is getting updates out faster, and keeping their phones up-to-date, even on a phone that is as cheap as the M5 Note, since it is still a very popular smartphone. It’s worth noting here that Google Play Services were not installed when we unboxed the phone. This isn’t uncommon for phones in China, considering Google is banned there, many people don’t use it. But it is pretty simple to set up. Just jump into the “Top Apps” app on the home screen and you’ll see the Google Services Installer there to install it. It doesn’t take more than a couple of minutes.. We’ve already reviewed numerous devices from Meizu with Flyme 5 on-board, so there’s not a whole lot that is new here for us. But for those unfamiliar with Flyme, the first thing you’ll notice is how colorful it is. Flyme 5 has plenty of colorful icons, as well as wallpapers. Which actually really help to make this 1080p display look even better. Like most user interfaces on devices coming out of China, there’s no app drawer here. This is something that those in the Eastern part of the world seem to really like. But here on the Western side, not so much. But, that is fixable, seeing as all you need to do is download a third-party launcher from the Google Play Store and you’re good to go.. One of the smaller, but definitely appreciated changes that Meizu made in Flyme 5 was moving the settings shortcut on up to the notification shade. Before this, you’d need to leave the Settings shortcut on your home screen to get to it (now it just sits in a folder of stuff you never use that often). Now one of the cooler apps that Meizu has included is the “Security” app, although I’m still puzzled as to why this isn’t included in the Settings app. This app has all kinds of great features that you’ll want to use to keep your device in tip-top shape. This includes a cleaner, which will show you how much cache is on your phone, especially useful if you are in need of space. it also shows you junk files, redundant APK’s and more. If you’re phone is running a bit slow, you can use the Accelerator to speed things up a bit. This will mostly close apps from the background and keep them closed until you open them. You can whitelist apps here, so that they don’t get closed. There’s also a power setting, which shows you the approximate amount of time that is left on your device, before it needs to be charged. This is estimated based on your usage. There are also different power modes there to help keep your phone going as long as possible. Again, it’s a bit weird that none of this is in the settings app as it should be.. Software on Meizu smartphones isn’t necessarily bad. The only real issue we have is the fact that they are typically out of date, which does open up users to security risks. Especially when it’s still sitting on a security patch from October, when it’s now February. If Meizu can get updates out to their devices in a faster manner, then Flyme OS would be a great user interface. Sure it won’t be everyone’s favorite, but it does add in tons of great features that even AOSP is still missing, as well as making their devices really stand out from the others that are on the market (like those from Xiaomi, Huawei and ZTE, also big names in China).. When it comes to the camera, the M5 Note actually is rather impressive. The backside houses a 13-megapixel camera, which is made by Sony and has a f/2.2 aperture. It actually takes some rather good photos. Now it’s important to note here that when it comes to pictures, part of it is the sensor, but often times the bigger factor is the post-processing software that Meizu has built. And it appears, at least to the naked eye, that Meizu has done a great job with the software here. Just about every picture I took with this phone came out pretty good. Now obviously something like the Galaxy S7, Huawei Mate 9 or another smartphone with a higher price tag, would do a better job. But given the hardware here, it’s really good. The background isn’t overblown, pictures aren’t overly saturated, there’s really not a whole lot to complain about. Even the shutter is lightning fast.. Now the actual interface of the camera app is also an important aspect. What good is there having a slew of features in the camera app, if no one knows where they are? That’s not the case with the M5 Note. You can choose modes from the button next to the shutter key. This includes Auto, Manual, Video, Beauty, Panorama, Light Field, Slow-mo, Scan, Macro and GIF modes. There is an HDR feature, but it’s an either on or off type of thing, there’s no Auto HDR, and it’s actually in settings, so it’s not a simple toggle, like some of the other features here. Something that would definitely be nice to have. Of course, you also have all of your favorite filters available for making your pictures your own.. You can check out all of the picture we took with the Meizu M5 Note (even the bad ones) in the Flickr Gallery linked below. These are all in their original resolution and are un-edited, so you can truly see how good or bad they actually are.. Outdated Security Patch (5 months old, at the time of writing). Micro USB connector instead of the newer USB-C. The Meizu M5 Note is a pretty good mid-range smartphone. It’s right on par with something like the Moto G4 that is available here in Western markets for around the same price. The M5 Note really shines in its build quality and battery life. There’s just not enough to be said for how good the battery life is on this phone, which is especially important for those that need their phone to last a full day, especially those that are heavy users. The only real issues we had with this device can all be fixed with software updates, so the future is looking bright for the Meizu M5 Note.. Should I Buy the Meizu M5 Note?. If you live in a country where the Meizu M5 Note supports all of the bands that you need for LTE, then definitely. Just remember that you get what you pay for – even though you get a whole lot for how little you pay for with the M5 Note.. Within Launches WebVR-Supported Web App, VR.with.in.

The following errors occurred with your submission. By dogmatism , Senior Member on 1st July 2017, 10:41 AM. I've seen couple of question on rooting this phone, here's a quick guide. M5 Note comes with a firmware number ending with G or A. G is global which is multiple language, as for A it is Chinese default, AND English. Mostly the firmware by default is 5.2.11.0 Or 5.2.12.0. These firmware, modified by sellers, installed Russian. Cuts the ability to update, and getting a a permanent root is impossible. So the best solution is to immediately flash/upgrade to any current firmware. Those with G firmware must install upgrade with G (but global version is slow in development) If your language is ENGLISH there is nothing wrong with flashing A. G users COULD flash a to A (it needs first to root and use flashfire to flash, I would not be going into this procedure). Flash files are named as "update.zip" Download them to your internal, with a file manager navigate to the folder where you downloaded or copied the "update.zip" and just pressing it, will prompt you to start the update procedure. Here is the official firmware download page. here is the latest beta update (for A). Download and upgrade as mentioned above. After upgrade your phone will reboot, and will display CHINESE language. Find the "settings" icon, scroll down to the bottom and enter the language (identify the language icon). when you enter this language option the first option will be languages , press and select English. Now, you have to register a Meizu account from your phone. Go back to setting >Personal > Meizu account. GO backto settings > finger print & security > at the bottom under <security> you will have [Root Permission] Option! Enter and activate. (you will need to re enter Meizu password).

Hi, after do this, my phone can not restart, why?. Join Date: Joined: Jun 2013. Join Date: Joined: Dec 2014. I think today, this can't work anymore. Meizu stopped to give access in root :/. Maybe If I success to change 6.X.X.X to 5.2.X.X, I could try your solution but how can I change that without root rights ? I'm currently running on a G version but if can try the A in english, it's not a problem for me. Join Date: Joined: Oct 2013. im using flyme 6.2.0.0A based from 7.0,this method is not working anymore,it will make our device bootloop,the systemless root method too,because we cant access root folder now,hope this issue will fixed soon.

Hands on with the Meizu M5 Note, a fast, stylish and affordable phone. | January 27, 2017 -- 11:38 GMT (19:38 GMT+08:00). GPS signal quickly lost if phone in pocket. The Meizu M5 Note is a nice looking Android phone. Released on December 6th 2016, it has a smaller form factor than the fast and sleek M3 Max that I reviewed last year .. The M3 Max has a 6 inch HD display, whereas the M5 note has a 5.5 inch HD display at 1920 x 1080 resolution. Its dimensions are 153.6mm x 75.8mm, It weighs 175g, and is thin at only 8.1mm. I found this phone easier to hold than the M3 Max. It is perfect for smaller hands.. Meizu say that this phone has been designed for consumers who want an affordable smartphone with good industrial design and an easy user experience.. The company says it has sold over 20 million Note devices since launching the range two years ago. It sold seven million of its previous generation Note devices.. The M5 Note has a 4000 mAh battery, which can be charged up to five times with just one of these high capacity power bank charges. Like the M3 Max, its fast charge technology means that the phone can be fully charged in 90 minutes.. Meizu say that this will support up to 32 hours of talk time, eight hours of browsing on 4G or five hours of playing resource intensive games.. Inside there is a 64-bit Helio P10 octa-core processor. Four A54 cores are running at 1.8GHz, and four run at 1.0GHz to reduce power consumption.. It comes with either 3GB or 4GB LPDDR3 RAM, with either 16, 32, or 64 GB of internal storage. It will support a micro SD card up to 128GB.. The M5 Note has an all-in-one metal sandblasted body available in four colours: champagne gold, grey, blue and silver. It has lines near the top and bottom of the metal case which are the antennae. It gives the case a nice crisp look.. The Android-based operating system on the M5 Note is Flyme 5 which is fast with great performance. I had no system crashes, or reboots with this phone, nor did I with the M3 Max.. Meizu told me that the international version of Flyme 5 currently does not have NFC, however, this will be enabled in a future software update. In addition, currently there is no VoLTE in the international version of Flyme 5.. The camera on this phone is really good. There is a 13 megapixel CMOS sensor which focuses the camera in 0.2 seconds. The rear camera has a five element lens with ƒ/2.2 large aperture. The front camera is 5 megapixel, ƒ/2.0 aperture, four element lens.. The rear camera takes great panorama shots, and the front camera has a real time 'beautifying' feature, the 'Face AE smart facial brightness adjustment'.. This tool can brighten and slim your face, and make your eyes look larger before you take the photo. I took a range of interesting selfies testing all the adjustments.. The device has a fingerprint sensor which stores up to five fingerprints. The phone also has a 'guest mode' with a password which enables the guest to make calls and send SMS from the device, although access to your personal data on the phone is limited.. I only had a couple of issues with the phone. I was not too impressed with the audio volume. The phone rings much more quietly than other phones I have tried. I missed several calls - even when i chose the most shrill ring tone for the phone.. The M3 Max was definitely louder than the M5 Note. However, the audio is crisp and clear at high volume and excellent through headphones.. I also lost GPS signal often when my phone was in my pocket. The M5 held the GPS signal all the way round my running route.. As soon as I took the phone out of my pocket the signal came back. Running with the phone strapped to my arm eliminated this issue.. I did not notice any other issues, and all in all, I was impressed with the device. The phone has all the features I need to make it a perfect fit for my lifestyle..

Internationally Meizu might not be as recognized as they are in China but they do have some interesting smartphones on sale internationally and one of them is Meizu M5 Note. The budget smartphone comes with a nice metallic unibody design and a vibrant display amongst a number of other features we will be reviewing.. Where to Buy Meizu M5 Note. Jumia Nigeria – See Offers. Meizu M5 Note Key Specs and Features. 5.5-inch, IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen, 1920 X 1080 pixels (403 ppi).

There’s a fairly large battery in the Meizu M5 Note, however, this does not always translates to longer battery life.

Now, when it comes to taking pictures the Meizu s like other smartphones in the budget category. Meizu M5 Note features a 13MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. With decent pictures can be taken in the presence of enough light, however, low light are usually characterized by a lot of noise.. For a budget device a MediaTek Helio P10 chip is a decent one and handles basic day day tasks quite smoothly. The Meizu M5 Note’s Octa-core processor clocks at a maximum of 1.8GHz and an ARM Mali-T860 MP2 GPU.This handles things like gaming even some high resolution ones with ease but might experience a slight lag when it comes more heavier ones..

Meizu M5 versus M5 Note – budget smartphone review. As we’ve seen with our recent Meizu MX6 and Pro 6 Plus reviews , Meizu is more than capable of delivering flagship tier smartphones at a reasonable price. Today, we’re taking a look two more phones from Meizu, but these devices are at the opposite end of the spectrum – the M5 and the M5 Note.. As their names imply, these two phones do have a lot in common. The Meizu M5 and the M5 Note. have the same 13MP main camera and 5MP front-facing camera sensors. Both have fingerprint scanners, both have 16GB of storage, both support microSD cards (up to 256GB), both run on Android Marshmallow with Meizu’s FlyMe UI and come in a variety of different color options.. But there are also some differences that are worth considering. Meizu is selling the base M5 for just $100 while the M5 Note commands nearly a 50% price bump, selling for $146. The higher price of the M5 Note means you get a larger, higher resolution display – a 5.5-inch 1080p panel versus the 5.2-inch 720 panel of the M5.. There’s also a big difference in the build materials of the phones.. The basic design is the same with a glass panel. covering the front of both phones. The M5’s body is wrapped in cheap plastic while the body of the M5 Note is wrapped in an aluminum shell with stylish chamfered edges. The M5 looks like it’s a hundred dollar phone, but the M5 Note looks like it should be selling for $300 or more. And to top things off, the Note has 3GB of RAM, a MediaTek MT6755 chip, and a 4,000 mAh battery. The base M5 only has 2GB of RAM and MediaTek’s slower MT6750 SoC with a 3,070 mAh battery.. As the spec sheets of these two phones. makes perfectly clear, the Meizu M5 Note is a much better device than the regular M5. It’s faster, has a better display, more RAM, faster processor, and added battery life make the M5 Note much for suited for someone who enjoys playing games or surfing the web.. But that doesn’t mean the M5 is a bad phone. The phone sells for $100 – roughly the same price as a decent pair of Bluetooth headphones .. Naturally, performance isn’t going to be a huge selling point for either of these phones. They handle the phone’s Flyme UI just fine and can multi-task reasonable well, but limited RAM means that apps fall out of memory pretty quickly.. For optimal performance, you will want to go into the battery settings and switch from “Balance” to “Performance” mode. You’ll sacrifice a bit of battery life, but the improved performance is well worth the trade-off.. Both phones can be used for gaming, but don’t expect a smooth experience if you’re loading up a first person shooter like Modern Combat or a fast-paced racing game like Need for Speed. You’ll be treated to long load times, dropped frames and intermittent. Our recommendation would be to stick to puzzle games or titles with minimalist. Again, the M5 Note does a little better than the base M5, but playing some of the newer games from. the Play Store can be a frustrating experience.. On the battery front, things are a bit different. Since both phones have underpowered processors and limited RAM, their respective batteries perform exceptionally well. The M5 and its 3,070 mAh battery cell is outstanding. Getting through a long day on a single charge is a breeze, even with two hours of gaming and 4 to 5 hours of screen-on time. The same can be said for the M5 Note and its 4,000 mAh cell. Most of the time, the phones have more than a 25% charge when plugging them in at night after being used during a 14 hour day.. And if you pretend that you’re over 60 and cut down on gaming and excessive web browsing, you can easily extend the battery life of both phones to two full days without breaking a sweat.. Since these devices are quite cheap, don’t expect too much from the 13MP main and 5MP front-facing cameras. The camera UI is clean and easy to use, but auto-focus on both cameras is slow. This means that there’s a good chance that you will miss the shot you wanted. But you can get some decent shots from both devices, just as long as you don’t zoom in. If you do, you’ll notice a lot of compression artifacts and blurred edges if you don’t have a steady hand.. If you enjoy taking pictures once the sun goes down, you’ll need quite a bit of patience if you want to get a good shot. More often than not, the images turn out blurry and even when you do get a blur-free shot it’ll likely be darker than you’d expect. Optical image stabilization could definitely improve the camera performance on the two phones, but that’s a luxury feature that’s reserved for more expensive devices.. Comparatively, the front-facing cameras of both phones fare a little better. The 5MP sensors can produce sharp images in good light and you even get Meizu’s beauty mode if you want to clean up a few of those annoying blemishes or magically knock off a few of those extra pounds you put on over the holidays.. As mentioned in our other Meizu reviews, you will have to use the included Google Play services installer to get the Play Store and Google’s other apps up and running. These two devices also use Meizu’s unique navigational system, which relies on tapping and pressing on the home button along with swiping up from the bottom of the screen to navigate back to the home screen or pull up recent apps.. Since I’ve now used four different Meizu phones over the past few months, I’ve gotten accustomed to. There’s no app drawer to hide away the apps you seldom use, but the interface is clean and there’s zero bloatware to speak of. You can always install a third-party launcher on the phone, but then you’d need to forego using the dozens of themes which allow you to completely customize the look of the software.. After all that, you may be thinking that Meizu M5 and the M5 Note aren’t worth your hard earned cash. If you’re on the hunt for a great mid-range device, I suggest you stay away. But if you need something simple and cheap, for someone who doesn’t have high expectations and isn’t going to push their phone to hard, the $100 and $150 price points of these phones make them extremely appealing.. It’s quite easy to find phones with much faster processors and superior camera performance, but those devices will likely cost double of what Meizu is charging for the M5 and M5 Note. My recommendation would be Meizu’s M5 Note, but anyone on a tight budget would likely be satisfied with either of these two phones – just as long as you opt for the 32GB models so you can install more than a few dozen apps before running out of storage..
