Please ask the question in above box. Does it have a fast charging feature?. No, it does not have fast charging. But it charges pretty fast with a normal charger, considering it has a 4000mAh battery.. Which one is good Redmi note 3 or note 4?. According to the specifications, Redmi Note 4 is one step ahead but from the point of user reviews and even from my point Note 3 must be better in operating.. But as Note 4 is newly released from Mi, so they will be more focussed on giving updates and solving bugs for Note 4.. Both are good and are approx. similar, choose what your mind says.. I would suggest note 4, it's latest and almost the same price plus 2.5D glass and grill speakers.. Now, Redmi 4 is good, but I am very much happy with Redmi Note 3.. NOTE 4 IS THE BEST CHOICE WITH GOOD STORAGE & RAM.. what is the difference between redmi and samsung?. Redmi is a Chinese brand and Samsung is a South Korean company. Samsung earns money at the time of product launch whereas Redmi earns by selling a large bunch of products in a long time. That's why the price of Redmi products always remains same from the time of launching to obsoletion. Samsung on the otherhand decreases its price with time, sometimes the price is half when compared to its price at the time of its launch.. Redmi has good features for lowest cost. But Samsung has good features for high cost.. Redmi is developing new technologies, but Samsung has new technologies in higher end mobile phones.. Redmi has good battery backup compared to Samsung.. Redmi has some good features which attracts the customers while using the phone.. main difference is performance.after some month usage samsung shows lag problem,heating issues,but after heavy usage also redmi doesn't heated up.plus redmi ha a massive 4100 mAh battery,which provides a long lasting usage.not go for brand ,go for performance. Redmi gives you the best handset in the budget segment; you get all the sensors. Good phone overall, but Samsung skips all these in their budget phones.. redmi have a 3gb ram and qualcom processor so redmi is faster then samsung so you better go redmi dont buy samsung. Can we use earphones in this phone?. Yes, you can use it in Redmi Note 3 with a 3.5 mm jack, but not in LeEco Le 2. Use a branded genuine accessories for an amazing sound quality along with a long durability.. Yes, you can and I would suggest buying the Mi Piston earphones.. Yes, Redmi earphones or any other universal type.. Yes, you will have to purchase them on your own.. It has a normal earphone port.. WHAT IS THE CAPACITY OF BATTERY OF REDMI NOTE 3?. Redmi Note 3 is equipped with 4100 mAh battery which is enough to last for a whole day. As I have mentioned before, it does not support fast or dash charging like LeEco le 2, so it takes atleast 2 hours to get fully charged .. Hi, it's capacity is 4050 mAh. It has a good battery backup.. good, normally 2.5days and on standby mode 5days. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Video Review.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Nick T.. Android - Android + Xiaomi - Xiaomi +. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction Let’s say that you’re in the market for a new smartphone, but you’re constrained within a very tight budget. One of your options is to settle for something on the lower end, but made by a well-known company – the Motorola Moto G and the Samsung Galaxy J5 are some of the first models to come to my mind. Alternatively, you may take a gamble and go for something a bit more… exotic; something like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. Xiaomi is one of the many Chinese brands we rarely get to mention, primarily due to their near-zero presence in the western part of the world. But when we do get to talk about Xiaomi’s handsets, the story usually revolves around how much you get for so little. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, for instance, packs a humongous battery, a high-resolution display, a 16MP camera, and a fairly powerful Snapdragon 650 SoC coupled with plenty of memory and storage space. All of this costs well below $200 in the Asian markets where the phone is officially on sale. Could this deal be too good to be true, however, or is this the absolute best bang you can get at this price point? And no less importantly, is importing one worth it given the extra fees you'll have to endure? The box contains: Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Wall charger (Output: 5V, 2A) Micro USB cable for charging and data transfer SIM card ejector tool Quick start guide Design Excitement and curiosity, sprinkled with a healthy dose of skepticism – this is what I felt as I was setting up the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 as my new personal phone. On one hand, it was my first time having one of the brand’s handsets as a daily driver. On the other, I was finding it hard to believe that a smartphone could retail for so little and not be terrible. Looks, however, weren’t what the Redmi Note 3 was going to win me with. Don’t get me wrong: the phone looks great for a budget offering, and it is clear that Xiaomi has put effort in giving it character – by going for a metal body, for instance, or by adding a shiny metallic trim around the glass covering the front. In spite of this, the handset couldn’t thrill me with its appearance. In the hand, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 feels bulky and heavy, which is to be expected given the considerable capacity of its battery cell. It is well balanced, however, and and its curved corners make it comfortable to handle. I’m also happy to report that all buttons work well, while the fingerprint scanner is positioned right where my index finger naturally rests. Oh yes, I almost forgot to mention that this thing has a fingerprint scanner! Very few low-cost phones will offer you this perk, and having it is a great convenience. Admittedly, the one on the Redmi Note 3 is fast and reliable. Display On the technical side of things, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 sports a 5.5-inch LCD display with 1080 by 1920 pixels, which, in human speak, means that it is big and stuffed with more than enough pixels to deliver clear and crisp visuals. For a budget-friendly handset, this screen is nearly perfect. I did have to add that “nearly” there because the screen’s colors aren’t exactly accurate. One flaw that tends to stick out is the cold color tone, giving whites a noticeably blueish look. Thankfully color temperature can be corrected from the settings menu, although I’m willing to bet that most people wouldn’t even notice that the screen is colder than it should be. Before I proceed, I must make it clear that I’ve had almost no troubles using the Redmi Note 3 in broad daylight. The screen gets bright enough to be used comfortably outdoors, and it would have been even easier to see if its glass surface wasn’t as reflective. At night, I sometimes took advantage of the built-in Reader Mode, which works pretty much like f.lux or Apple’s Night Shift – it filters out blue light to reduce eye strain.. This review is based on a Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 with Snapdragon 650 SoC and 3GB of RAM, running a global software ROM with Google services pre-installed.. 5.91 x 2.99 x 0.34 inches. 150 x 76 x 8.65 mm. 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.48 inches. 142 x 72.4 x 12.2 mm. 6 x 3.04 x 0.43 inches. 152.5 x 77.2 x 10.9 mm. 5.96 x 2.92 x 0.29 inches. 151.5 x 74.1 x 7.3 mm.

The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

I don't know how many comments are going to be "BUT IT'S SO CHEAP!" but I know that is going to be a heavy part of the criticism given here. PA understands this, but many of you don't seem to have a clue as to why price doesn't factor into the review process for MOST reviewers..

I have ordered a number of phones from Chinese retailers. It only costs an average of about $20 via DHL and they normally arrive (in Canada) no more than a week after the order is placed. Import duties average around $25 - no extra tax or costs. I have never had any hassles with any of my orders. In terms of rating the Redmi Note 3 in comparison to similarly priced phones, I would pick the Redmi Note 3 first because of its superior battery life compared to the competition. But then, I am not that fussed about photo quality.. (Posts: 622; Member since: 18 Sep 2012). posted on 05 May 2016, 11:24. I am not really sure whyPA rate phones. Probably due to sponsors that will like their phones to be rated high. Why not do like gsmarena? Review the phones as you do now but don't rate it. Even if the ratings were not subjective, some people wil not agree with it. Go and ask teachers and they will tell you this.. (Posts: 600; Member since: 26 Apr 2014). posted on 05 May 2016, 11:31.

This phone doesn't even deserve a 6. Xiaomi phones are really difficult to use. Not to mention the ui is a total iOS ripoff. Their phones slow down and lag after months. Even for its price, it still doesn't deserve a 6. Price shouldn't factor in any reviews.

I had this phone for a month and got rid of it mostly because;. -notifications arrive as they want, you really can't rely on MIUI... -apps kept shutting down, listening on spotify during morning commute was painful, I had to start the playback 2-3 times again. Not a big issue but definitely annoying. -sometimes the alarm doesn't fire off in the morning.. -the call experience was pretty robotic, the voices are clear on both sides, but nothing like they sound in other phones, I love my wife's voice on the phone and this is not the device I use with joy when calling with her on the phone. -other than that, the performance is great, if that is the only thing you need, but the device might be a bit overrated on the internets, is either used by people who can't afford a quality flagship phone, or by people who had mediocre/slow phones and are blown away with this device.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 review:. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Redmi Note 3 features a premium metal body, fingerprint scanner and a brilliant 5.5-inch display all at a low, low, price.. The Bad The camera, while adequate for a budget phone, tends to overexpose shots and it's a shame the phone drops the removable battery feature found on the previous model.. The Bottom Line With its comfortable design and low price, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is a top choice for phone-buyers on a budget.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 vs ZTE ZMax 2 vs Huawei Honor 5X. I've always been a big fan of Xiaomi's phones and the Redmi Note 3 is no exception, but also may now be my new favourite. That's partly because of the phone's classy metal body (upgraded from plastic on previous models) and partly because of its low price (around $220, £150 and AU$290, respectively). But it's mostly because Xiaomi has turned out a quality product that fits well into my lifestyle. However, if you're outside of Asia, you'll have to work some online magic to get the phone, and it may not work as swiftly with your carrier if it doesn't support your network's bands, so you'll need to check.. Xiaomi's Redmi Note 3 packs premium metal for a budget price (pictures). Budget phones usually skimp on storage space, but not the comfortable, 5.5-inch Redmi Note 3. This guy comes with 32GB, and if you need more, you can use one of the phone's dual-SIM slots as a microSD card slot for up to an additional 32GB of storage. Gaming performance was great; I loved the smooth framerates on Asphalt 8 and when switching between apps and sending emails, I rarely experienced any noticeable delay. The Note 3's non-removable battery lasted nearly-14 hours in our video looping battery test; a respectable number for the vast majority of phones.. Software wise, Xiaomi's usual MIUI skin runs over the Android 5.1 Lollipop operating system. Since all the app icons spread out across multiple home screens, it looks like a mix of Android and iOS. But other cool features, such as the ability to quickly move all the apps on one screen to the next, and weekly security updates, help make up for the atypical layout. While it isn't standard Android, MIUI does a great job making the phone easy to use, especially with a "Lite mode" which simplifies the interface for not so tech-savvy types.. The phone still uses physical keys instead of onscreen menu buttons.. Now, if there's one thing that I downright didn't like, it's the Redmi Note 3's lackluster camera. It's slow and lacks Auto HDR (high dynamic range), which meant I had to manually turn this mode on. It also had some exposure troubles, which resulted in slightly darker images unless you adjusted the exposure setting yourself before shooting. Neither is a deal-breaker, but they did knock down my experience a few pegs.. While it's a bit heavier than your typical flagship phones, the Redmi Note 3 is still comfortable to hold, and after switching back to my daily phone, I missed having the Note 3's rear-mounter fingerprint sensor. Truly, for the price, it's an excellent budget phone at any size. If you can find it, get it.. Quad-core 1.4GHz, dual-core 1.8GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 650. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 – Performance, Speakers & Call Quality. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 – Software. The Redmi Note 3 is the latest large-screen, low-cost phone from Chinese handset maker Xiaomi – the company often referred to as “The Apple of the East”, thanks to its dominant position in that particular part of the world.. The company’s Redmi Note series has traditionally been focused at the low end of the market – even more so than Xiaomi’s other astonishingly good-value offerings, such as the flagship Mi5 series. However, it offers premium features such as metal bodywork, a fingerprint scanner, 5.5-inch IPS screen and a surprisingly fast octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 processor – all for around £130 for the base model.. The Redmi Note 2 was certainly no slouch when it came to build quality, but it was still an all-plastic phone and felt a little cheap when set alongside Xiaomi’s other handsets, such as the sleek Mi4. The Redmi Note 3 doesn’t leave anything to chance and comes equipped with a robust metal chassis that gives the entire handset a pleasing feel of weightiness.. It isn’t entirely made of metal, though – the top and bottom edges are plastic, which blend in seamlessly with the rest of the design – but this definitely feels like it’s in a class above most budget blowers. The construction is also rock-solid, with no noticeable movement when gripped tightly. The rounded edges make the Redmi Note 3 comfortable to hold, and this is accentuated by the fact that Xiaomi has clearly put a lot of thought into ergonomics and what should go where.. The power and volume controls are on the right-hand side, falling just under your thumb. However, the real star here is the fingerprint scanner, which resides on the rear of the device, just below the 13-megapixel camera. It’s the same location that LG chose for the scanner on both the Nexus 5X and LG G5 , and is almost effortless to reach.. In fact, the moment you scoop the phone up off a table or lift it out of your pocket, your index finger naturally comes to rest over the scanner, allowing you to wake the phone and unlock it in one movement. The downside of having the scanner on the back of the phone is that you can’t access it when the handset is resting on a table, face-upwards.. Along the top edge of the Redmi Note 3 you’ll find the 3.5mm headphone socket and an IR blaster, something that’s quite common on phones intended for the Chinese market. While it might seem like a throwaway addition, being able to change TV channels or adjust the volume on your stereo using your phone never becomes old and I’d personally like to see it featured on more handsets..

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. On the bottom edge of the handset you’ll find the micro-USB charging and data port sitting alongside the in-call microphone. While Xiaomi has embraced USB Type-C with its Mi4C and Mi5, the Redmi Note 3 sticks with the older connection standard – just like Samsung did on its Galaxy S7 .. Sadly, there’s no NFC included here, even though Xiaomi has recently changed its previously dismissive stance on the technology by bundling it with the Mi5. As a result, you won’t be able to use the phone to make contactless payments using Android Pay, which recently launched in the UK.. The Redmi Note range – as the name suggests – traditionally guns for the “phablet” sector of the market, and this third offering is no exception. It’s sporting a large 5.5-inch IPS screen with a 1,920 x 1,080 resolution – hardly earth-shattering, but still more than acceptable in a phone that costs this little. The pixel density of 403ppi is decent as well, and it isn’t possible to pick out individual pixels unless you press your nose up against the glass.. Colour replication and contrast could actually be a little better in my opinion – unless the screen is at a reasonably high brightness level, things tend to appear a little washed out – and it’s sometimes hard to see in really bright sunlight.. The screen isn’t clad in Corning’s Gorilla Glass either, but Xiaomi insists it has used a glass that offers the same level of protection – and even ran a car over a Redmi Note 3 to prove it.. The Redmi Note 3 is available in two flavours – the MediaTek Helio X10 version and the more recent Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 version. The version I have for review is the former. You also have different storage options, with the 16GB edition shipping with 2GB of RAM, while the roomier 32GB version has 3GB of RAM.. MIUI is a surprisingly fast UI, but even so, the MediaTek processor copes admirably under heavy load. Even with multiple apps running simultaneously, I didn’t experience any stutters or jerkiness – although there were times when a “Just a sec” message would appear, which suggested that the handset was having to re-load the Home menu after some intensive work.. Like many Xiaomi devices, the Redmi Note 3 comes with various modes that are intended to conserve battery life, and switching to the more demanding “Performance” mode naturally delivers more impressive results at the expense of stamina.. According to the Geekbench 3 benchmark – which I ran in “Performance” mode – the Redmi Note 3’s multi-core rating is 4,658, outranking the Samsung Galaxy S6, which achieves a score of 4,108. In Geekbench’s single-core test, the phone is more in line with the original Nexus 5. The relatively low screen resolution certainly helps, but Xiaomi’s handset is clearly no slouch when it comes to overall performance.. The Redmi Note 3’s speaker is located on the rear of the phone and is reasonably loud and easy to hear, even in a crowded environment. There’s the usual lack of bass that one associates with mono phone speakers however, and the audio is quite tinny and unpleasant at times. There’s a little raised piece of plastic next to the speaker, which – when the phone is face-up on a flat surface – ensures that the speaker isn’t muffled or covered.. Call quality is decent, with audio coming across crystal-clear. A noise-cancelling mic is located on the top edge – next to the 3.5mm headphone socket – and keeps background audio to a minimum, while the placement of the phone’s mic on the bottom-left edge means that it’s unlikely to be obscured by your hand in the middle of a call.. The Redmi Note 3 supports 4G networks, but only bands 3 and 7 in the UK. That means if O2 is your network provider – or you use a company that uses O2’s masts, such as Giffgaff – then you’ll be limited to 3G. Like a number of Chinese handsets, the device offers dual-SIM support, although it should be noted that it uses micro-SIMs; not the more recent nano-SIM format.. Xiaomi’s phones are all based on Google’s Android OS, but they use a custom skin that is perhaps one of the most drastic examples in the Android sector. MIUI bares many visual similarities with Apple’s iOS, and even goes as far as completely removing the trademark Android app drawer, instead placing all of your available apps on your homescreen. MIUI version 7 comes loaded on the Redmi Note 3 and is based on Android Lollipop.. However, Xiaomi has put in a lot more effort than most hardware makers, ensuring that MIUI offers something a little different to stock Android.. For example, you can turn on a feature in the OS that gives you a different lockscreen wallpaper each day. It’s also possible to download and install various themes to make your phone’s menu system look entirely different – other Android phones have this feature, but not to the stunning degree seen here; there are literally thousands of themes to choose from, some of which include animated lockscreens.. There are plenty of other little improvements and enhancements, too, which make the Redmi Note 3 feel very different from your typical Android device.. Since it isn’t intended for sale outside of China, the Redmi Note 3 doesn’t come with any Google applications as standard – turning it on for the first time doesn’t prompt you to input your Google account details, but instead asks for your “Mi Account” – Xiaomi’s own login system.. This is backed by a suite of features including a fully fledged app store (in Chinese), a backup tool and even cloud storage allocation. Many resellers will install Google apps on Xiaomi devices, but these “custom” ROMs often come with annoying bloatware as well.. While the “stable” build of MIUI that shipped on our review unit has full English language support, Xiaomi does offer “global” ROMs for its devices that feature Google apps and more language options – but updating your phone is more cumbersome than it needs to be, with a bootloader unlock request being required before you can flash any new software.. MIUI is one of the most recognisable and appealing Android skins out there, but you should be aware that it’s a bit of a minefield if you’re using the phone outside of China. You may have to put in a lot of effort to get things working to your satisfaction, but as the thousands of Xiaomi fans outside of China will tell you, it’s more than worth the hard graft.. Next Camera, battery life and verdict. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

Xiaomi's Redmi series has been wildly popular over the past few years and for good reason. The low prices and good features have really set these models apart, and even other Chinese players have found them hard to compete with. Thanks to this competition, you can get a lot more in a budget or even mid-range smartphone than you used to be able to a few years ago.. After pushing powerful components and cutting prices, manufacturers have started focusing on premium aesthetics and build quality, which appeal even more to customers. We've seen a lot of metal being being used by companies rather than plastic, such as with the recently released Honor 5 X ( Review ) and Le Eco Le 1s ( Review ). In terms of specifications, 3GB of RAM is not something to boast about anymore, and Coolpad has proven to everyone with the Coolpad Note 3 ( Review ) that even fingerprint sensors are not restricted to premium phones.. In light of all this, the Redmi 2 series feels a bit dated, and so Xiaomi is right on time with the new Redmi Note 3. We had a first look at the device back in December , although that was the original version running on a MediaTek processor. The one launched in India sports a more potent Qualcomm chip which should make it more competitive. Just like the Xiaomi Redmi 2 Prime , the Redmi Note 3 will also be made in India.. The two biggest competitors for the Redmi Note 3 that immediately spring to mind are the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note and LeEco's Le 1s. Can Xiaomi's latest offering become the undisputed winner in the sub-Rs.15,000 segment? Let's find out.. Look and feel The moment you take it out of the box, the Redmi Note 3 looks and feels incredibly premium, especially in gold. The full-metal body gets a smooth matte finish that doesn't attract fingerprints. It's easy to keep clean too, as dust and grime come off with a simple wipe.. In the front, we have the 5.5-inch full-HD IPS display with very narrow side bezels. There's a glossy rim running along the edge of the front facia, which is elevated above the rest of the display to protect it from scratches when the phone is placed face-down. It's a nice design touch but it's also a bit of an annoyance on the ear when you're making calls. The display has a scratch resistant layer, although Xiaomi hasn't explicitly stated this anywhere.. There's a 5-megapixel camera on the top along with a notification LED for alerts. Mercifully, the capacitive buttons at the bottom are backlit. The volume rocker and power button are quite ergonomically placed on the right, while the left side houses the hybrid Dual-SIM tray. In addition to the headphones socket on the top, we also have an infrared (IR) emitter. The phone uses a standard Micro-USB connector for charging and data transfers.. Around the back, we have a 16-megapixel camera, a dual-tone dual-LED flash, the fingerprint sensor, and a speaker grille at the bottom. The Redmi Note 3 ships with a 10W charger, data cable, SIM ejector tool, and instruction leaflets. The quality of the accessories seems good, and they should last.. We feel that Xiaomi has done a terrific job with the design and aesthetics of the Redmi Note 3. The finish of the phone is excellent and the display is crisp and vibrant. The IPS panel has very good colour reproduction and features Xiaomi's Sunlight Display hardware feature which indeed makes it decently legible even under direct sunlight.. We also like how comfortable the phone feels in the hand. It's a bit tricky to use one-handed, but is fairly slim at 8.7mm with good weight distribution.. Specifications The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 might be a budget smartphone but there's certainly nothing low-end about the hardware it packs. This is the first phone to roll out with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 650 SoC, which is a pretty big deal given its near-flagship level performance in some benchmarks. It's a hexa-core SoC, much like the Snapdragon 808 found in the Moto X Style , but instead of the Cortex-A57 cores, we have two of ARM's more powerful Cortex-A72 cores running at 1.8GHz. The other four cores are Cortex-A53s which chug along at 1.4GHz. This SoC still uses the 28nm fabrication process but the GPU is a newer Adreno 510, which is one notch lower than what's present in the flagship Snapdragon 820 chip.. In benchmarks, we witnessed some pretty impressive numbers especially considering the price of the device. We got an average of 74,303 in AnTuTu, which is higher than what we got from many high-end phones based on the Snapdragon 810. GPU performance is equally impressive, and we recorded 31fps in the T-Rex test in GFXbench, which once again is competitive to scores posted by Snapdragon 810 devices.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 will come in two variants. What we have today is the one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage, but you can opt for the other model with 2GB of RAM and 16GB storage if your budget is tight. Officially, storage can be expanded by up to 32GB by using a microSD card instead of a second SIM in the hybrid slot, though unofficially you can put cards of bigger storage capacity as well.. Thanks to the Qualcomm chip, the phone features Category 7 LTE for Band 3, 5, 40 and 41 along with VoLTE support. You also get dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac, Bluetooh 4.1, USB OTG, FM radio, Miracast, GLONASS, and BeiDou. NFC is one feature that's missing.. Software The phone ships with an Android Lollipop fork called MIUI 7, which is has been reworked from the ground up. Compared to earlier versions of MIUI, version 7 is certainly more likable and better polished. It's still a single-layered interface, but it does let users customise the look and feel with transition effects and themes. The Theme Store app has a pretty good selection of free themes, and we particularly liked the Marshmallow one.. The lock screen gets a feature called Wallpaper Carousel, which displays random wallpapers from a user-selected collection which is updated daily. The notification shade has separate tabs for incoming alerts and toggle switches, to avoid clutter. There's also a lite mode for those looking for a simplified interface, and a child mode that lets you restrict which apps your children have access to when you let them play with your phone. The Settings app is where you'll find the most interesting changes.. Reading mode, which is essentially a bluelight filter, can be toggled from the notification shade. The strength of the filter can be adjusted in the Display sub-menu. The fingerprint sensor can recognise up to five fingerprints. Xiaomi Vice President Hugo Barra stated during the phone's launch that it's possible to record your lip pattern too, though it failed to unlock the phone when we tried it.. Signing up for a Mi account gives you 5GB of cloud storage for backing up your contacts, messages, photos, etc. You also have the option to password protect specific apps to keep nosy people out of your private chats, for example. You can hide files with fingerprint authentication using the Explorer app.. Xiaomi has incorporated a one-handed mode, which you can enter or exit by simply swiping right from the capacitive Home button. You can even choose the size to which you want the display to shrink. The phone comes with a preloaded app called Mi Mover which lets you move apps and data to or from any other Android device. MIUI 7 supports up to 13 indic languages. Apart from the standard Google keyboard and SwiftKey, our test unit also had a keyboard called Fleksy, which turned out to be much better than we had expected.. In terms of preloaded apps, you get basic productivity tools along with some additional ones such as Mi Remote. This lets you set up the IR emitter for various infrared-capable devices, including DSLR cameras. The Mi Store app is a marketplace for all Xiaomi products sold in India. The Security app lets you monitor data usage and run basic maintenance tasks. You also get Facebook, WPS Office, and the usual Google apps.. Performance Xiaomi Redmi Note 3's hardware and software come together nicely to deliver a very pleasing Android experience. The interface is fluid with barely any noticeable stutter when multitasking. Call quality is good and the phone had no trouble latching on to multiple carriers' LTE networks in Mumbai.. Our review unit was fairly stable apart from a few reboots which occurred when the phone got warm when running benchmark tests with it plugged in. Speaking of heat, the metal body does get warm during continuous video playback and when recording videos, but it doesn't get too uncomfortable.. One niggling issue we did encounter was the long time it took to get both SIMs working. This wasn't a problem if there was only a single SIM in the phone, but when we inserted a second one, it would take a really long time for the phone to detect it. We were stuck with a 'No Service' message for more than 10 minutes on one such occasion. This could be a pain if you swap SIMs often, but otherwise it's not that big a deal. We're happy to report that the fingerprint sensor works well and is quite fast at unlocking the phone.. The Redmi Note 3 is great for multimedia, especially thanks to its crisp display. The phone can handle 4K video playback. The speaker is fairly loud for alerts and media although we missed the stereo effect. The music player is functional and you can switch between different audio profiles set for different types of earphones. You can quickly share media files with other Xiaomi devices using Mi Drop. We didn't have issues with audio quality with our own earphones. In the 32GB version, you get about 26.2GB of accessible storage space. On average, you have about 1GB of free RAM available if you only have a single app running.. Camera The rear camera has a 16-megapixel sensor and a wide f/2.0 aperture. Both landscapes and macro shots captured in daylight have good detail. However, objects in focus lack a bit of definition and aren't very sharp, but this is only visible once you zoom in. Images look good on the phone's display though, and as long as you don't need to crop the picture at full size, you should be good.. The camera also struggles a bit with sharpness and depth under artificial lighting. Low-light images are not too shabby, as there's barely any visible noise in the dark areas. The dual-tone flash is decent for nearby objects but don't expect too much from it. 1080p video recording is good but very shaky due to lack of any software stabilisation. Also, 720p video quality is not great so we recommend shooting in full-HD all the time. The front camera captures good selfies in daylight thanks to the same wide f/2.0 aperture.. The camera app is simple to use and has plenty of shooting modes. We liked the handy HDR toggle switch next to the shutter button, which makes life a lot simpler. You swipe down or left for filters, and the other way for shooting modes, depending on whether you're holding the phone in landscape or portrait. The Panorama mode does an okay job of stitching photos together. The Manual mode lets you play with white balance and ISO settings but there aren't any options for aperture or shutter speed.. The focusing speed is good, even in low light. You can capture an image with the secondary shutter button placed in the centre of the focus ring. Other modes includes Gradient, which helps level out shots even if you tilt the phone; Fish eye, which adds a fun effect; and Beautify which lets you smoothen out skin blemishes.. Battery life The non-removable 4050mAh battery managed to get us through 12 hours and 21 minutes of continuous video playback, which is quite good. During actual usage, we easily managed to go more than a day, and this was without resorting to the battery saving modes. The phone supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge feature, and we managed to charge the Redmi Note 3 up to 20 percent in half an hour. We wouldn't call this super quick but it's better than nothing.. Verdict The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is priced at Rs. 9,999 for 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, and Rs.11,999 for 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, which is very aggressive when you consider the overall package. Xiaomi has also partnered with Hungama to offer a free two-month subscription to its streaming service.. It's hard to find fault with the Redmi Note 3 as it ticks all the right boxes, and in some ways, rivals phones that cost a lot more. The metal body and fingerprint sensor are welcome additions to the Redmi series, and make the Note 3 feel relevant in 2016. You also get a great display, very good battery life, and a powerful SoC. The camera isn't too bad, although we could have done with sharper stills and better quality HD videos. MIUI 7 is improved compared to previous versions, and is quite likable. We do wish storage expansion beyond 32GB was officially supported, and it woudn't have hurt to throw in NFC just to complete the package.. A few kinks aside, we believe that the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is easily one of the best smartphones available for under Rs.15,000 today, and has the potential to get better with future software updates. If you are confused between this, the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note ( Review ) and the Le 1s ( Review ), we can confidently give the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 our vote..

The Snapdragon versions use a special display technology known as 'Sunlight Display' in which the phone detects the ambient light and makes pixel level adjustments in order to be better legible in the sunlight. It also features a blue light filter for low light night reading. Another notable feature of the phone is the presence of a finger-print sensor at the back. It is not only fast but very accurate as well. It can be used from all directions and can unlock the phone in around 0.1 seconds. It can also be used for capturing images via the front or the rear cameras.. Kenzo runs on an Android based MIUI 7 OS which was upgraded to MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0 and then to the newest MIUI 9.

Though u can manage to play nova 3 but if the question comes about playing las Vegas this handset Will make u cry.so laggy that u can't play at all. Ram management could have been better.

Quick Charging as per QC 1.0. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is one of Xiaomi’s trump cards to capture the low-mid end market for 2016, being the successor of one of Xiaomi’s most popular phones, the Redmi Note. Featuring some very enticing specs at a price that is unbelievable, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 seems to bring most of the right ingredients to become the king of the low end.. But can its real world performance do justice to its beastly specifications? Or is there a catch in this too-good-to-be-true deal? Read along as we find out if the Redmi Note 3 “Pro” can put its money where its mouth is.. Here’s a quick look at the spec sheet for the Redmi Note 3:. + 1.8 GHz Cortex A-72, x2; Adreno 510. Xiaomi is no newbie in the smartphone making game, and the Redmi Note 3 is a tribute to the expertise the company has acquired over the years. Moving over the plastic builds from the Redmi Note 2, the Note 3 features a metallic build that grants it a nice heft and leaves no stone unturned in hiding away the true price of the device. No way you can say this is a cheap device, because it certainly does not look cheap.. On the face of it, the Redmi Note 3 would appear as. a device sporting a metallic unibody build. The marketing materials sure do point to this as they smoothen out and make the back appear to be made of one material. But, the phone is not all metal and glass. The top and bottom ends of the Note 3 are definitely plastic, but the combination of plastic bits to the metallic back that Xiaomi went for does not easily give it away. body bears a cool, smooth finish; while the plastic has a glossy finish which is less slippery. This works in the device’s favor in two ways: one, Xiaomi has a way to incorporate the antennae needed for radio communication without resorting to plastic band lines; and two, this texture difference makes the device less slippery than an entirely flat, metallic phone would be.. Speaking of flat, the back of the Redmi Note 3 is not entirely flat. It does bear curves at the edges, and these help with the grip of the device considering that it has decent thickness to it, along with a bit of height. In my case, the curved back and rounded corner help in holding the phone, resting on the palm for one handed use.. While we are on the topic of the back of the device, the back also features the rear camera module in the center, with the dual tone LED flash placed horizontally below it. Below these, you will find the fingerprint scanner inset significantly, making it very easy to find without looking at the back. In comparison, the camera module lense as well as the glass on the LED flash are flush with the back, making them vulnerable to scratches. On the bottom end of the back, you will find the Mi logo, along with some self-declaration to comply with Indian government rules. Below this, you will find a drilled grill pattern of which the middle 50% open up to the speaker on the inside.. There is also a tiny obtrusion just below the speakers, on the plastic bottom cap. Xiaomi mentioned that this was intentionally placed so that the speakers are not muffled when you place your phone on the back, but in my experience, the device did not show any noticeable gap between the phone and any flat surface because of this lip. It’s barely there, and it does not make any difference, positive or negative. Fortunately, it also does not cause any rocking of the device in any direction.. At first glance, you see a black slab of glass…. Unlike the back, the front bears a very minimalistic look. You get the speaker grill deep inset on the top, along with the ambient light and proximity sensor beside it and the front camera and notification LED following it along. The 5.5″ FHD LCD display sits in the middle, and three backlit capacitive buttons are below it. You can remap these to a certain degree for other actions, so you get some choice in the matter even though you can’t disable them entirely in lieu of the navigation bar. The front is so clean, you see only see a black slab of glass in the first glance. Focus, and then you can make out the various elements. I really like such a super clean and smooth look for my devices, but your subjective opinion may differ and that is alright.. the Dark Grey color of the Redmi Note 3 does not bear the black border bezel around the display, since the entire front of the device is black. This gives a very uniform color and a clean, distraction-free look to the device that I really appreciate. Bezels are necessary, I get it, but it is the choice of coloring which decides if it becomes a distraction or something you’d never notice. In contrast, the Silver and the Gold color variants have matching colored front, but with the black bezel border around them. If these are a distraction to you, I would suggest to opt for the Dark Grey color variant which has an all-black front.. Dark Grey Color with Black Front. Moving on to the sides of the device, you get the microphone hole and the headphone jack on the top left and the IR blaster on the top right. bears only the slot for the hybrid SIM + micro SD card combination, and is otherwise devoid of any buttons or marking. The bottom side bears the primary microphone hole and the micro USB connector on the left (and not on the middle, as a lot of phones tend to go for). The right side of the device gets the volume rockers towards the top and the power button below it. These have the same texture as the rest of the metal back, so you may occasionally have an issue hitting the correct button in the first try. Otherwise, these are good stiff with a sufficient press and have absolutely no wiggle or sideways travel to them.. Before we move on, the box contents of the Redmi Note 3 are very minimal. You get a standard USB to micro USB data cable, a power adapter rated at 5V/2A of output, a SIM removal tool and some documentation. An important message in the documentation, relating to the SIM slots, is that the Redmi Note 3 does not support dual-4G. If one SIM has 4G/3G/2G, the second SIM will only be restricted to 2G. Also to mention, the Redmi Note 3 does not have NFC in it.. For its dimensions, the Redmi Note 3 has a very typical setup as you come to see in 5.5″ phones. The phone is a tad bit smaller than the OnePlus One , and is almost as thick. But the Redmi Note 3 bears a larger battery, an improvement of over 1,000 mAh in pure capacity as compared to the OnePlus One. As a result, it feels more dense and heavy even though the phone is just 2 grams heavier than the OnePlus One. The curves on the phone make it feel more smaller than the difference in pure dimensions, and the Redmi Note 3 can be used one-handed better than the OnePlus One.. is one of the best built phones I have owned. Holding the phone, you certainly do not feel as if this is a $150 phone. It kills all the other devices in my collection, considering how much this phone retails for. With a weight of 164 grams, the Redmi Note 3 is a tad bit heavier than the OnePlus One (162 grams), but bears slightly smaller device dimensions overall and a 33% increase in battery capacity. As a result, the Redmi Note 3 feels really solid in the hand, but not blocky either due to its curved side profile. There is no creaking or noticeable bending, no noticeable gaps, no other hardware issues. It’s just a well built phone altogether, a rarity for phones from Chinese manufacturers (although our review unit was manufactured in India as part of Xiaomi and the Indian government’s “Make in India” initiatives).. The Redmi Note 3 has an air of confidence to it. You can hold the phone without a case and not be terrified of dropping it. It is not a “tough” phone, but it certainly has that air to it. It is slightly slippery as smooth finish metal phones tend to be, but I haven’t had any incidents of it slipping out of my hand or off the table or any slight incline. Overall, I am very satisfied with the package Xiaomi has put together in terms of build quality and design and have no significant complaints.. The Redmi Note 3 bears MIUI 7.2.3.0 based on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. We have done an extensive, comprehensive review of MIUI 7 on the Redmi Note 3, so check that out!. I did find some smaller annoyances after the review section. Mainly, I could not find any setting to turn off Android’s Spell Checker, and that the brightness slider compulsorily needs the finger to be at the current level before the slider can be dragged, which can be difficult to do when you can’t see what is on the screen..

Tech Reviews Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Camera Review | Camera Review Redmi Note 3 India. Redmi Note 4 Released In India Read review about Redmi. Note 3 audio & sound quality Full Review Redmi Note 3. I have got many messages, asking about Redmi Note 3 Camera Review. I know many of you might be waiting very eagerly for experiencing the Redmi Note 3 and everyone is waiting for the information about its release date in India, But still there isn’t any official information about the release or price of Redmi Note 3. I”ll keep updating the information about it’s release and price on my Facebook page .. I have taken many pictures in different light conditions and played around the camera features. In this post, I”m going to share the review and my experience about camera quality of Redmi Note 3.. The Redmi Note 3 has 16 MegaPixel rear shooter which takes pretty decent images. The rear camera is equipped with dual-tone dual-LED flash and phase detection to focus faster and more accurately. The Device comes with default Xiaomi camera app which has many features like Panorama, Beautify, Fish eye, HDR and yes the rear cam also supports “Manual Mode”. The camera app has the option to take images in two frames 16:9 on 12MP and 4:3 on 16MP.. Redmi Note 3 Rear Camera Screenshots:. The camera interface is very simple. It has three panes – the default one shows the viewfinder with a virtual shutter, flash trigger and front camera key. Sliding up or down will help you switching between front/rear camera, slide left to right on the main camera screen to open advanced camera setting such as Panorama, Beautify, Manual Mode etc, and slide right to left will give you a choice of 12 filters with live previews. Whereas from “Manual Mode” you can set white balance and ISO manually”.. I can’t say this is the best camera around 15MP but still its taking very decent pictures with low noise level & details especially in daylight. Night or low light shooting is average but we should not blame the Redmi Note 3 camera for this because almost all Android smartphone are still struggling with night shooting.. HDR Mode is fast and impressive. Its not taking too much time for capturing the images in HDR mode. Images with HDR mode contains more contrast, color and less noise.. Redmi Note 3 Rear Camera With Auto Mode:. Redmi Note 3 Rear Camera With HDR Mode:. Redmi Note 3 Rear Camera With Auto Mode In Night:. Redmi Note 3 Rear Camera With HDR Mode In Night:. Redmi Note 3 Rear Camera With Lens Blur Mode:. Video recording screen has the same interface. You will have the option to record slow motion & time lapse video after sliding left to right. Default camera app of Redmi Note 3 supports 1080p full HD stereo video @30fps. It will support the 4K video recording with some 3rd party apps but I hope in future OTAs, Xiamoi will enable the 4K video recording option in their default camera app. (Watch the featured video for reference of video quality). The Indian version of Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 comes with 5 MP front-facing selfie camera. You can take a nice and soft selfie. The UI for front camera is also similar to the rear cam, it has the beautify mode on main camera screen and you will get 12 image filter by sliding from right to left. Selfie in beautify mode coming better it looks bit polished but its good enough to set your WhatsApp DP 🙂. Redmi Note 3 Front Camera Sample Images Without Beautify:. Redmi Note 3 Front Camera Sample Images With Beautify:. While recording videos and taking all these photos, I have noticed that the phone is getting overheated after continuous use of the camera. I haven’t noticed any lags even after overheating. OS/software is working fast, smooth & flawlessly in all scenario. the heating issues before its final launch in India.. I have used all images after compressing and resizing, So to know the actual differences and actual image quality please download this zip file , it has all the images plus some extra images in actual size and quality.. Enjoy !!! Don’t forget to share it with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus.. TAGS Note 3 Camera Review Redmi Note 3 Redmi Note 3 Camera Review Redmi Note 3 Review Xiaomi Redmi Note 3.

Whereas Redmi Note 4 has Snapdragon 625 which is an octa-core processor, it supports Quad HD videos up to 720p and performance is not as good compared to Redmi Note 3. But not even very low than that. The battery life is much better compared to Redmi Note 3..

Both are good, but it depends on your requirements like the Note 4 has got a better RAM than Note 3 and Note 3 on other hand has a better camera. Rest of the features are same in both the mobiles.

Redmi Note 4 has the following advantages over Note 3,. 1- It has a better battery.. 2- It has a better camera sensor.. 3- It has more efficient battery optimization. 4 -Most importantly, it's bang for the buck.. Well, if you compare their price, then Redmi Note 3 is better, and if you compare regarding usage, then Redmi Note 3 is better again.. But it only has one disadvantage that until today it doesn't get an Andriod 7 update. Which phone is better Redmi 4 or Redmi Note 3?. Before we buy any smart phone ,we need to check 3 parameters: 1st performance, 2nd look and size of the phone and 3rd budget. While coming to the performance Redmi note 3 shows a best performance than Redmi 4 because Note 3 has Snapdragon 650, where as Redmi 4 has Snapdragon 435.

I am a highly satisfied user of Redmi Note 3, and a few of my friends own either Note 3 or Note 4, and they too are quite satisfied with their respective mobile phones. Talking in terms of hardware configuration, Redmi Note 3/4 boast of the best processors, camera, signal reception, and strong build quality with beautiful metal casing. Both of these mobile phones have almost all sensors that can be found in models worth around Rs. However, the only problem with Redmi Note phones is the hybrid tray for SIM2 which allows either SIM card or the memory card to be used at any given time. A dedicated tray for SIM would have been a better option.. 5-inch, Snapdragon 435, 13MP rear camera. If you want slightly bigger (5.5-inch) phone with a pretty good processor - Redmi note 3 is the best option. For smaller (5-inch) display with better backup - Redmi 4 is best.. Another option is Redmi note 4 - successor of Redmi note 3. Or wait for 1 or 2 months and grab Redmi note 5 - I would suggest it - it has possibly dual rear camera ..

When you start using, you actually come to know you have made a wrong choice. The screen gets yellow patches in few months, service center will claim that you kept the phone in pocket, so the screen gets pressure that's the reason for yellow patches to occurs. Really?
