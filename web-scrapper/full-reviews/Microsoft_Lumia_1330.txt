While the network going crazy the first pictures of the Lumia 535, which you can find an overview in this article, by closely examining one of these we came across what could be the other two terminals Lumia branded Microsoft. Retired Evleaks, Chinese sources are now the only ones still active for some preview of the new devices coming soon. In the picture you see at the top and bottom, as well as the now famous Lumia 535, Microsoft branded with the body, close to Lumia 1520, we recognize a possible Lumia 1330, very similar in size and shape to phablet the previous generation. There is also a third Lumia Microsoft that we can not identify the third generation, given the dense range X30. We can confirm that we have had rumors of a possible successor of Lumia 1320, but then it is quite legitimate to wait for this coming one year after the presentation of the first.

Today we have already seen another device which has been leaked, at least a dummy model of it. What I am talking about is the Nokia Lumia 535. This is supposed to be one of the first low budget devices with Microsoft branding and the continuation of the Lumia 520 successor. Microsoft has also said that they will be presenting new devices on November 11th , though there is not clear yet which and how many devices Microsoft will present there.. Now it seems that WindowsBlogItalia has revealed one more device with Microsoft branding that will probably be officially announced by Microsoft on November 11th. At the picture below you can have a look at the device which is supposed to be the Microsoft Lumia 1330. It is standing beside a Lumia 1520 and therefore we can say that it will be another phablet. It also seems that the device has a camera button what would mean that it can not be a low budget device but must be at least a mid class device.. So what do you think of this photo, does it seem legit? Well we will know it on November 11th at the latest, but it would be an understandable move by Microsoft if they are planning to release a continuation of the Lumia 1330 also because they are trying to conquer the smartphone market with low budget and mid class Windows Phones..

Microsoft-Branded Lumia 535, Lumia 1330 Leaked Ahead of Tuesday Launch. Hitesh Arora , 10 November 2014. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. While the Redmond giant seems all set to launch its first Microsoft-branded Lumia smartphone on Tuesday , the anticipated device, previously tipped as the RM-1090, is now rumoured to be dubbed Lumia 535, and has been leaked in images along with purported specifications. Coming to the second rumoured Microsoft-branded Lumia smartphone, the Lumia 1330, which was leaked by Windowsblogitalia with an image (see above) that only reveals the Blue colour smartphone's very large back - tipping a display as large as 6 inches. As yet, there are no other details available about the device, and we are not sure if this will also be launched at Microsoft's scheduled announcement on Tuesday.. On the other hand, some images have also emerged out of China showcasing another Microsoft-branded Lumia phablet device, which is rumoured to be called the Lumia 1330, the possible successor to the Lumia 1320 .. First up, are the purported images and specifications of the alleged dual-SIM Microsoft Lumia 535, which were tipped by WMPoweruser. The image showcase a white-coloured Lumia smartphone with Windows Phone 8.1. The report claims that the device will also come in Black, Blue, Grey, Green, and Orange colour options.. On the specifications front, the unannounced Lumia 535 is said to include a 5-inch qHD (540x960 pixels) display; a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor; 1GB of RAM; a 5-megapixel rear camera with flash; a VGA (0.3-megapixel) front camera; dimensions of 140.2x72.45x9.32mm; a weight of 145.7 grams, and a 1900mAh battery.. Notably, the purported specifications are in-line with the earlier leaked Tenaa and US FCC listings. The alleged orange-coloured device on Tenaa was listed as 'RM-1090', with Microsoft branding on the back and a 5-inch qHD (540x960 pixels) display; a 1900mAh battery, and 140.2x72.4x9.3mm dimensions..

> Microsoft > Windows Phone. Here's what the Lumia 1320 successor could bring us. Reader comments Load old comments. Lumia 1320 official photos (5 Images). 32 GB of internal storage without card support. Microsoft Lumia 1330 has already been spotted out in the wild, but little is known about the device that could be unveiled by Redmond at MWC 2015 in spring 2015.. And still, a report published by NPU reveals a few new details about the phone, but keep in mind that nothing is confirmed so far, so nobody can tell for sure whether these specs are real or not.. First and foremost, Lumia 1330 will serve as the official successor to Lumia 1320 , so it's only natural to expect an advanced camera capable of shooting high-quality photos. Lumia 1320 comes with a 5-megapixel camera, but all signs point to a significant improvement in this area, with this new report suggesting that a 14-megapixel unit is very likely.. At the same time, the 1320 sports a VGA camera on the front, and again the 1330 will make taking selfies a lot easier with the help of a 5-megapixel camera.. Lumia 1330 will most likely come with a 5.7-inch display featuring a 720p resolution, so if these figures are accurate, it's going to fall in the phablet category, alongside the Lumia 1520. If this is indeed the 5.7-inch device that has recently been spotted online, it's another indication that Microsoft is working to expand its phablet offering with new models.. What's more, the aforementioned source adds that Lumia 1330 is expected to ship with a quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor and Adreno 305 GPU, as well as with 1 GB of RAM. Obviously, these aren't really outstanding specs, but they do make for a decent Windows Phone device capable of providing the best of Microsoft's operating system on a 5.7-inch screen.. According to rumors, Lumia 1330 could be equipped with 32 GB of internal storage, and in case this is indeed true, Microsoft might not offer a secondary storage option besides OneDrive cloud storage. MicroSD card support is very likely to be skipped on the 1330, sources say.. As for the official launch, some are pointing to MWC 2015, while others claim that the 1330 could be introduced even sooner because new 5.7-inch devices have recently received FCC's approval and are now waiting for the go-ahead to hit the market.. Of course, specifics on these new phones are really vague at this point, but more details will most likely be unveiled very soon, as Microsoft is working to expand its so-called “Microsoft Lumia” brand with new models as fast as possible.. # Microsoft # Windows Phone # Lumia 1330 # Lumia 1320.

Microsoft has been working on the successor of the Nokia Lumia 1320 smart phone. The company is working its strategies in quite a meticulous manner. So named, Nokia Lumia 1330, the images of the same are getting viral hits online is expected to be a budget offering. The expectation for this peppy and vibrant phone is gaining a lot of likes online. Let’s hope this Nokia sees the light of day soon.. To get a taste of excitement, here is what you can expect out of the Lumia 1330.. The Lumia 1330 will carry a Snapdragon 400 chip with a 1.2GHz Quad-Core Qualcomm processor. This processor will come paired with an Adreno 305 graphics unit. The smart phone will also be coupled with 1GB of RAM. The internal memory will be boosted from 8GB to 32GB. The 1320 had the Qualcomm MSM 8230 AB Snapdragon 400 in its 3G model and MSM8930AB Snapdragon 400 in the LTE model. The 1330 should have a little more cutting edge than its predecessor in terms of processing and performance.. Another notable feature will be the new Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 or GDR2 operating system. Taking various hints from the Windows Phone 8.1 model, the new phone will have new additions. The device is set to bring MPA or Message Access Protocol that would allow a smart watch to access the text messages. The update will also contain HID 1.1 that would bring Bluetooth keyboards. The phone will also have HOGA or HID over General Attribute Protocol. The HOGA would enable the device to interface with various accessories that come with the device. Lastly, the device will also contain the Absolute Volume Control Support. The device would also carry an Accelerometer sensor along with the Compass and Proximity Sensor. Additional Sensor would definitely be a plus point. The device will also have SMS (threaded view ( MMS, Email, Push Email and IM messaging integration. The Lumia will also have a HTML5 enabled browser without Flash support.. The Lumia smart phones have One Drive with 15 GB of cloud storage space; the 1330 should have the same.. The Lumia 1330 will sport a 5.7 inch display that is a little shorter than the display on its predecessor. The display will have 720 x 1280 pixels resolution and a pixel density of 258 ppi that is going to be more than its predecessor (245 ppi). An interesting aspect about the Lumia 1320 was its Clear Black Display. The appearance of details and resolution was prominent. The new Lumia should carry the same, only 0.3 inches shorter. The integration of 16 Million colours is a neat addition to the tough and sturdy Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The Nokia Lumia series with the IPS capacitive touch screens have always been satisfying with the focus on details and clarity.. The Lumia 1330 should continue with the same. The Adreno 305 Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) should increase the video viewing and gaming experience to an increased level. The design of the Lumia 1320 carried 164.2 x 85.9 x 9.8 mm measurement and carried a weight of 220 grams. The device is a phablet that is a tad shorter than its predecessor, the dimensions and the weight is expected to vary slightly. Although the name Lumia 1330 is not official yet, it’s a matter of time till the official name of the device is out.. The Lumia 1330 will be a 4G enabled smart phone. The device will add updates to the connectivity options. The device will feature Wi-Fi connectivity (Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n) along with Bluetooth connectivity (Bluetooth 4.0) with A2DP, EDR, LE/ apt-X and a Micro USB provision (v 2.0) It will also consist of GPS connectivity with A-GPS, GLONASS.. The new Nokia Lumia 1330 will be known popularly for its extraordinary camera. The company is introducing a whole new camera that will promise better clarity and better results. The older version, the 1320 has a 5 MP primary camera coupled with a VGA front snapper. However, the company is going to introduce an all new interesting 14 Mega pixel pure view rear camera that would have Auto Focus and LED Flash. The camera would also feature geo-tagging and touch focus. Another exciting bit is that the smart phone will have a 5 Megapixel front facing snapper. The front facing camera will have 2592 x 1944 pixels resolution. This camera will be more purposeful than just a selfie-clicking camera. The camera is hence a significant boost compared to its predecessor. The device coupled with the new Windows Phone update will function faster than ever. The Lumia 1330 will also have FM radio support (most likely with RDS support).. It will also have Active noise cancellation with dedicated mic and will support MP3, WMA, WAV audio formats with the aAAC+ player. The device will also support MP4, WMV videos with the H.264 player. The device will also have a photo and video editor, thereby reducing the worry of editing files on a computer. The Dolby Headphone found on its predecessors should be the same, as it sustained the credibility of the Lumia devices. The advantage of having a memory boost from 8GB to 32 GB is always good news.

> Microsoft > Windows Phone. The company could launch the phone at MWC 2015. Microsoft Teases the 5.7-Inch Lumia 1330. Lumia 1330 leaked photos (4 Images). Next month's MWC 2015 in Barcelona, Spain, is expected to bring us several new Lumia devices and one of them could be none other than the successor to Lumia 1320 .. Obviously called Lumia 1330, the new model has recently been more or less confirmed in a post on the Facebook page of Microsoft Lumia Indonesia , which teases a new phone with dual-SIM capabilities that “would be unveiled very soon.”. Details have not been provided until now, but judging by the size of the device, this could be the new Lumia 1330, a new 5.7-inch phone running Windows Phone 8.1 and supposed to help Microsoft become more relevant in the phablet industry.. Lumia 1330 is very likely to come with specs that would keep it in the mid-budget sector, so unfortunately for those who were expecting a Microsoft flagship at next month's mobile conference, that's not going to happen.. The Lumia 1330 is very likely to come with a 5.7-inch OLED display with a resolution of 1280x720px and Gorilla Glass 3 coating. The device will most likely offer both single- and dual-SIM capabilities, with the latter possibly available on a second Lumia 1335 variant.. Previous reports indicated that Microsoft would integrate a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor and an Adreno 305 GPU, as well as 1 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage space.. As far as cameras were concerned, leaked documents pointed to a 14-megapixel rear unit with Carl Zeiss optics and a 5-megapixel one with a wide angle for selfies.. Interestingly, Lumia 1330 could be the first device to launch with Windows 8.1 Update 2, a new version of Microsoft's mobile OS that has recently been confirmed in official documents. A release date for Update 2 is not yet available, but given the fact that the 1330 is expected to be unveiled in March, sales could begin in April, when the new OS version could also see daylight.. More to come in the next few weeks as we're getting closer to MWC 2015, when Microsoft is finally expected to share more about its mobile plans with Windows 10.. # Microsoft # Lumia 1330 # Lumia # Windows Phone.

Microsoft is expected to announce the entry level Lumia next week - on November 11. Attentive readers however have spotted that next to it on the blurry image there is a yet-unseen Lumia phablet.

Microsoft Lumia RM-1109 documents spotted, possibly the Lumia 1330 [Update]. with 23 comments. Mobile World Congress 2015 is only a few weeks away and leaks regarding a new Microsoft Lumia smartphone have already surfaced. Janela Tech has revealed a document from Anatel; a Brazilian regulatory agency similar to the FCC, the filing dubs the upcoming phone as model 'RM-1109.'. The filing indicates that the phone will be powered by a BV-T5C model, 2500mAh battery. As this is relatively a large battery capacity for a Windows Phone, it has further fueled rumors that this device is probably the Microsoft Lumia 1330 .. Specs of the unannounced device are said to include a 5.7-inch 720p display powered by a 1.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor. It might also feature a 14 MP PureView rear camera along with a 5 MP front facing camera; which is becoming quite the norm for low and mid end Microsoft Lumia devices. The device may also come packed with 32 GB internal storage too.. As none of these documents and specifications have been confirmed, we'd advise you take this news with a pinch of salt. With that being said, it is important to note that Janela Tech has been quite accurate in the past as well which leads us to believe that these documents are indeed real.. Source: Janela Tech via Windows Central |Filing image via Janela Tech. Update: Apparently, the RM-1109 is in fact an unannounced Lumia 640. The device will reportedly be a Dual SIM handset with integrated Digital TV which is becoming quite popular in the country. Details are quite scarce regarding whether the Lumia 640 will be exclusive to Brazilians or if it'll see the light of day in other countries as well..
