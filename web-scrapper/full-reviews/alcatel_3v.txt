The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Midnight Blue and Midnight Black colours. Alcatel 3v preview: Display, features and camera. 1080 x 2160 IPS LCD 6-inch display. It was back in 2015, at that year’s. that Alcatel started to catch the eye. In the Idol 3, it created a. that promised close-to flagship performance and specifications at a fraction of the cost. In the following years it failed to excite as much with the follow-up Idol generations, but that could all be about to change.. has refreshed its model names to make them simpler. There are no more Idols or Pops anywhere to be seen, just numbers. Alcatel 1, 3 and 5, with variations on those themes. The standout among the budget models however is clearly the Alcatel 3v. with a long aspect ratio screen at a high resolution. leaning towards 18:9 ratio screens, making a. that looks unique is becoming more of a challenge than before. The front is almost all screen for many of them, and the same is true of the Alcatel 3v. Side bezels are fairly slim, with slightly thicker framing at the top and the bottom.. Apart from that, there’s nothing else to talk about on the front except the usual collection, including the front facing. camera, earpiece and ambient light sensor on the top panel. There aren’t any capacitive or physical buttons on the front, they’ve been dumped in favour of virtual onscreen ones.. It’s on the back things get a bit more interesting. Alcatel has covered the rear of the. in a really attractive, glossy finish, reminding us a little of the HTC U11, except – for budget reasons – this isn’t created using a high-end glass treatment, it’s more a chromed plastic. Even in our brief time with the. phone, it seemed almost impossible to keep fingerprints off, but looks good and felt comfortable in the hand, despite the phone’s larger size.. Placed centrally on this glossy back you’ll find a fingerprint sensor within easy reach of an index finger, along with a dual. and dual LED flash, as well as the rather large Alcatel logo.. Around the edges you catch a glimpse of a little more cost-cutting, as the entire thing is predominantly plastic. That is to be expected at this end of the scale though, and isn’t at all surprising, or off-putting.. The right edge is home to the textured power button and removable SIM tray, while the left has the slender volume rocker. jack on the top edge, and the usual suspects on the bottom edge: micro USB and two grilles covering the. On the whole, it’s a really attractive. and one that’s surprisingly compact given the size of the display. Top marks to Alcatel’s design team for this one, it’s a budget. you won’t want to hide away.. The biggest feature in the 3v, and what will likely draw in the consumers, is the display. It has what Alcatel is calling a 2K resolution display, and looks as brilliant on first impressions as it does big. The actual resolution is 1080 x 2160, which is the 18:9 version of full HD, also known as full HD+. this cheap, that resolution is welcome indeed.. Text and detailing looked crisp and sharp on first impressions, and the entire panel was bright, colourful and without any obvious flaws. Which is pretty surprising at this price point, and is more than likely down to the fact that the 2.5D glass has been fully laminated to the display panel, leaving no air gaps.. One feature Alcatel has stated it’s bringing to many of 2018’s. is facial recognition, and that’s going to be available in the 3v too. on the front, you’ll be able to pick up your. phone, or press the power button, and it unlocks using your face. According to the company, this feature can’t be fooled by a photograph, and in our initial look, seemed to work well.. If you feel facial recognition isn’t secure enough, there’s also the fingerprint. on the back, that’s made up of one 16-megapixel. camera, that combine to offer the same bokeh-effect in portrait photos as we’ve seen on dozens of other handsets. It can capture 1080p video at 30 frames-per-second and has a bunch of other fun features like a manual shooting mode, panorama, PDAF, video stabilisation and time lapse among others.. side of things, it’s the usual scenario for Alcatel. The 3v runs a fairly clean-looking version of. Oreo with a few twists on stock. have the typical colourful icons, and no particularly crazy additional. or functions were mentioned to us during our time with Alcatel at MWC.. To keep it running smoothly at a budget, Alcatel opted for a quad-core MediaTek processor paired with 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage, which perhaps is the one slight low point in an overall decent package. The 16GB/2GB combination is low by most comparisons, but thankfully, there is support for. Given the processor and memory setup, we do worry a little about overall performance.

In 2017, we saw more manufacturers follow the near bezel-less 18:9 display trend and it looks like that will continue into 2018. For the new year, Alcatel will bring these elements to its new product lines that consists of the 1, 3, and 5 series. Christian Gatti, who is the Global President Alcatel Business Division and Executive Vice President TCL Communication, states that :. “By modernizing our smartphone designs and being one of the first global manufacturers to offer 18:9 full view displays across the majority of our lineup, we’re able to refocus our efforts at democratizing flagship style features and making these experiences accessible to almost any consumer worldwide.”. This movement will be an important step as companies like Honor and ZTE are also vying to position themselves as provider of affordable quality handsets. Perhaps what makes Alcatel different is that it has the backing of TCL, which licensed the brand, and is known for its production and distribution of TVs. Utilizing TCL's extensive knowledge with LCD panels, Alcatel will be able to provide the best possible displays, while at the same time keeping costs down, and also expediting the process when it comes to manufacturing handsets.. Although Alcatel did shed some light on its 1, 3, and 5 series handsets at CES 2018, it only offered folks a teaser of what is to come, saving the big reveal for Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona. Luckily, we were able to get some hands-on time with a couple of the handsets, the Alcatel 5 and Alcatel 3v. The 5 is the more interesting out of the two, as it has a design that is quite different, with a majority of the bezel residing on the top end of the handset. The bezel houses dual front-facing cameras, along with the usual proximity and ambient light sensors. Overall, this handset feels good in hand and should be an interesting offering coming in at around $300.. The Alcatel 3v is the more conservative looking phone that looks modern thanks to its 18:9 aspect ratio display with rounded corners. This device feels good in the hands and has a dual camera on the rear, along with a relatively glossy back surface. Alcatel has stated that this model will retail for $200.. It's good to see Alcatel providing various solutions at excellent price points, with phones that look much better than your average bargain offerings. With prices starting at $100, the new line of handsets should make for alluring options for budget-minded shoppers. For the time being, this is a small preview of what Alcatel has to offer, with the full reveal happening next month at MWC..

Leak: Alcatel 3V To Sport A FullHD+ Display, 2GB Of RAM. January 17, 2018 - Written By Mark Real. Roland Quandt has leaked the specifications and press renders of the Alcatel 3V.

While the company promised that it will provide more information about its newest mobile device at the upcoming Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Roland Quandt has already released both the press renders and the detailed specifications of the handset.. The leaked specifications state that the Alcatel 3V will be powered by the MT6737 chipset from the Taiwanese semiconductor company MediaTek. The MT6737 SoC is comprised of a quad-core ARM Cortex A53 64-bit CPU running at a maximum frequency of 1.45GHz and the Mali-T720 GPU. According to the leak, the smartphone will include 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal flash storage that could be expanded using a microSD card. The leak also claims that the device’s dual rear cameras are equipped with one 16-megapixel sensor and one 2-megapixel snapper, while the front-facing selfie shooter is equipped with an 8-megapixel sensor.
