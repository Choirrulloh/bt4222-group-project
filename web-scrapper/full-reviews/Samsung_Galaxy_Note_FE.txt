Samsung Galaxy Note FE (Fan Edition) Review. by Maxwell Ramsey. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 2 Interface, Functionality, Performance and Connectivity. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Samsung Galaxy Note Fan Edition specifications. Introduction The Samsung Galaxy Note Fan Edition needs no introduction. In fact, no device we can think of has garnered more visibility while its actual release was so limited in size and scope. The Galaxy Note FE could arguably be tagged as a simple reincarnation of the Note 7 , and that is certainly a valid observation. Samsung chose to refurbish a large selection of returned devices. Using salvageable components from the beleaguered Note 7 series, Samsung was able to reduce gross waste, and even extract materials that could be put to use in other products. During the time that was taken to tear-down, reclaim, and recycle all the returned stock, Samsung continued to make progress with its other smartphone products, particularly with its flagship Galaxy S-series. The end-result, by making only two significant changes, Samsung made something that is actually a little more, and a little less, than what the Note 7 was. Design Still elegant in 2017 The Note FE has the exact dimensions and physical design of its predecessor, making it a two-handed device. The only visual cues that this is a different model are the lack of the Samsung logo under the earpiece, and the name of the device on the back. Outside of that, even though it is “last year’s” design, the Note FE feels great in the hand, and the symmetrical motif with the sharp curves in the display and rear glass back plate blend nicely into a subtly noticeable metal frame. In all, the design fits nicely into what we have seen so far in 2017. The color options for the Note FE are the same as was available last year, black, silver, gold, and coral blue, with the latter still among our favorite color schemes, the light blue touch contrasts perfectly with the copper metal frame. Design features are otherwise unchanged from last year, due to the remanufactured nature of the Note FE. That is not a bad thing, the materials are all top notch, Gorilla Glass 5 protects the display and backplate, and water resistance is still present, with the Note FE packing an IP68 water and dust resistance rating, allowing the device to survive up to 30 minutes in as deep as 5 feet of water. Display Bright and bold, the Note FE’s AMOLED panel will not disappoint With 2K resolution, the Note FE carries on with Samsung’s penchant for making vivid AMOLED displays. Though, the 16:9 ratio is arguably an outlier among flagships this year, the arrangement makes sense for a device with a suite of functionality baked-in to utilize the S-Pen. Even with momentum of big-ticket video media making the push to a narrower aspect ratio, like 2:1, the 5.7-inch has plenty of room to let you take it all in. With the new Samsung Experience UI, the resolution is set to FHD by default. In addition to kicking the pixels into high gear at 1440 x 2560, you can also opt for the more battery and processor friendly HD of 720 x 1280. That noted, users will be able to discern subtle differences in UI fluidity when changing resolution settings, but after the initial switch, you still have to look closely to really see the difference overall. In addition to being able to swap through resolution settings, Samsung lets you switch between different screen modes that adjust the color characteristics of the display. The default setting is “Adaptive display,” which tends to bring you all the color, indeed, saturation is pretty high, maybe too high for some users. “AMODEL cinema” places the display in a mode suitable to playing HDR10 video. “AMOLED photo” puts settings in the Adobe RGB color space, and “Basic” places colors in the standard sRGB scheme, which is arguably the best option, but beauty really is in the eye of the beholder. On this unit, the “Adaptive display” pumps up all the color to “11,” while “AMOLED photo” seems to deliver the best all-around balance.. 6.04 x 2.91 x 0.31 inches. 153.5 x 73.9 x 7.9 mm. 6.28 x 2.89 x 0.32 inches. 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1 mm. 6.06 x 2.99 x 0.31 inches. 153.9 x 75.9 x 7.9 mm. 6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches. 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm.

(Posts: 297; Member since: 06 Oct 2011). posted on 05 Sep 2017, 11:43. How is it possible that this FE Edition has more score than the original note 7, it has a smaller battery. And by now those specs are 2016. I don't understand this score thing. But it's not accurate at all. (Posts: 463; Member since: 14 Feb 2016). posted on 25 Jul 2017, 08:55. I don't care what any biased Samsung fanboy says, but this is unacceptable. This was mentioned in the S8+ review as well. Samsung must figure out a way to fix this issue. The FE is far too expensive to stutter when gaming. My 6P from 2 years ago doesn't do this, and it has a weaker chip. Samsung - We want to love your devices, but real world performance must be improved.. (Posts: 161; Member since: 25 May 2017). posted on 25 Jul 2017, 09:14.

I believe some PA posters are literally paid Samsung reps. I don't know how many times I must explain this simple concept. Some phones have a greater degree of lag. Some phones have such a great degree of lag in which it's declared an issue. If a review notices lag/stutter, there is most likely an issue as this observation has been tested in various scenarios. Multiple reputable sources mention gaming lag on many Galaxy reviews. This is an issue, not just the phone lagging in one occurrence.. (Posts: 231; Member since: 16 May 2017). posted on 25 Jul 2017, 11:54. in response to #20 Hide. Samsung was caught in the past for paying people to write bad reviews of the HTC One and had to pay a fine. I don't doubt any second that these Samsung fans here are paid by Samsung..

It continues to baffle me how much people rag on the site, writers, review scores, other commenters, yet come back regularly and comment at length. Seems to me the most likely reason is that they are paid to do so. Especially when they advocate for one company at length.. (Posts: 3170; Member since: 03 Oct 2015). posted on 25 Jul 2017, 20:23. in response to #20 Hide. But you really have to stop talking as if only one side of the blind fanboy nation are at fault, all these blind fanboys are equally annoying and stupid.

If you have saved $1 for every time you have written 'lag' on phonearena.com, you would have saved more than a million dollar. Is it some kind of kick for you to write lag and samsung in the same sentence every time?. Even if s8, note 7 lags as you say, they are still very good smartphones. If an iphone user can live with retina display in 2017, a Samsung user can also live with occasional stutter..

Don't you get bored writing same point again and again?. Considering the fact you are nexus user, you shouldn't be worried about samsung's device so much. If in the future samsung can fix its ' tremendously lagging devices' you can switch from nexus and buy a samsung device. But writing same thing on phonearena.com every other day, will not help you or samsung or anyone. That is why i said get some life and stop worrying about samsung's lag so much..

The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (marketed as Samsung Galaxy Note7 ) is a discontinued Android phablet smartphone that was produced and marketed by Samsung Electronics. Unveiled on 2 August 2016, [6] it was officially released on 19 August 2016 as a successor to the Galaxy Note 5. Although it is the sixth main device in the Galaxy Note series , Samsung branded its series number as "7" instead of "6", so that consumers would not perceive it as being inferior to the flagship Samsung Galaxy S7. Its successor, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 , was announced on 23 August 2017.. The Galaxy Note 7 is an evolution of the Galaxy Note 5 that inherited hardware components and improvements from the Galaxy S7, including the restoration of expandable storage and IP68 water resistance, and new features such as a dual-sided curved display, support for high-dynamic-range (HDR) color , improvements to the bundled stylus and new software features which utilize it, an iris recognition system, and a USB-C port. Demand for the Galaxy Note 7 on-launch was high, breaking pre-order records in South Korea and causing international releases to be delayed in some markets due to supply shortages. The Galaxy Note 7 also received positive reviews from critics, praising the quality of its construction, HDR support, as well as its streamlined user interface, although it was panned for its high price and increasing similarities in overall specifications to the main Galaxy S series phones.. On 2 September 2016, Samsung suspended sales of the Galaxy Note 7 and announced an informal recall , after it was found that a manufacturing defect in the phones' batteries had caused some of them to generate excessive heat, resulting in fires. recall was announced on 15 September 2016. [7] [8] Samsung exchanged the affected phones for a new revision, which utilized batteries sourced from a different supplier. However, after reports emerged of incidents where these replacement phones also caught on fire, Samsung recalled the Galaxy Note 7 worldwide on 10 October 2016, and permanently ceased production of the device on 11 October. Due to the recalls, Samsung has issued software updates in some markets that are intended to " eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices ", including restricting battery capacity, and blocking their ability to connect to wireless networks. Samsung has stated that it intends to recycle reusable silicon and components from the recalled models, and release refurbished models "where applicable".. The recall had a major impact on Samsung's business in the third quarter of 2016, with the company projecting that its operating profits would be down by 33% in comparison to the previous quarter. Credit Suisse analysts estimated that Samsung would lose at least US$17 billion in revenue from the production and recall of the Galaxy Note 7. The Note 7 had the shortest life span of any Samsung phone.. In July 2017, 9 months after the Note7 recall, Samsung released a refurbished version of the Galaxy Note 7 called Galaxy Note Fan Edition (marketed as Samsung Galaxy Note FE ). It has a smaller battery of 3200 mAh and is supplied with Android Nougat with Samsung Experience UI, the operating system of the Galaxy S8 .. 4.4 Issues with replacement phones. 4.5 Second recall and subsequent discontinuation. 4.5.1 Disabling of functionality. 6 Note FE ("Fan Edition"). 7.1 Galaxy Note 7. 7.1.1 Samsung Exynos 8890 Models. 7.1.2 Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Models. 7.2 Galaxy Note Fan Edition (FE). 7.2.1 Samsung Exynos 8890 Models. The Galaxy Note 7's hardware is similar in overall specifications and design to the Galaxy S7 , with a metal and glass chassis, IP68 water resistance, and a microSD card slot. [9] The Note 7 is equipped with an octa-core Exynos 8890 system-on-chip in most markets, and 4. In China, Japan, and the United States, the Note 7 uses the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 instead (which supports older CDMA networks that are extensively used by wireless carriers in these markets), [10] [11] [12] Unlike the S7, which uses Exynos chips in this market, Canadian models of the Note 7 also use the Snapdragon 820. [13] The Note 7 uses a USB Type-C port—marking Samsung's first mobile phone with the symmetrical connector. The Galaxy Note 7 features a 5.7 inches (140. mm) 1440p Super AMOLED display. Similarly to the "Edge" models of the S6 and S7, the display curves over the side bezels of the device; the curvature allows the Note 7 to be 2.2 millimetres (0.087. in) narrower than the Galaxy Note 5. [9] The display supports high-dynamic-range video , [16] and is coated in Gorilla Glass 5. [17] As with all Galaxy Note models, the device is supplied with an active stylus branded as "S Pen". The Note 7 stylus supports 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and is water resistant. [9] The Note 7 features the same 12-megapixel rear-facing camera as the S7, [9] with a "Dual Pixel" image sensor and f/1.7 aperture lens. The Galaxy Note 7 also offers an iris recognition system, using a front-facing camera and infrared illumination. The iris scanner can be used for unlocking , and as authentication for other features of the device (such as Samsung Pay and Secure Folder). A fingerprint reader is also embedded in the home button. The Galaxy Note 7 is supplied with Android 6.0 "Marshmallow" and an updated version of Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz user interface and software suite codenamed "Project Grace". It features an "always-on display" mode, which can display a clock and notifications on-screen when the device is not in use; different clock styles and support for notifications from third-party apps was added for the "Grace" version. The Screen off memo feature also leverages this mode, allowing users to write notes on the always-on display. The OS also features several new tools supporting the S Pen stylus, including translation, a screen magnifier , and a GIF recording tool. The previous suite of note-taking apps were also consolidated into a single Samsung Notes app. The Galaxy Note 7 introduces a security feature known as "Secure Folder"; it allows users to create a private workspace, protected by an authentication method, with separate user data and apps that are sandboxed from the main system. Installed apps can be cloned into Secure Folder, and users can designate whether notifications generated by apps in the Secure Folder are displayed from outside it. Secure Folder is based on the Samsung Knox 2.7 technology, which also added the ability for enterprises to control the distribution of system updates, and improvements to mobile device management and Microsoft Exchange Server integration. The device also introduces Samsung Pass, a platform allowing apps to provide biometric authentication using its iris scanner. Samsung reached partnerships with several major U.S. banks to explore the integration of Samsung Pass into their mobile apps. Pre-orders for the Galaxy Note 7 opened the day following its unveiling, with a U.S. [9] [18] Samsung skipped the numbering of the Galaxy Note series directly from " 5 " to "7" to synchronize it with the flagship Galaxy S series , and the Galaxy S7 line. The company stated that consumers may have perceived the Galaxy Note models to be inferior in technology to Galaxy S models because the numbering in their names were one digit lower. Pre-orders in South Korea already broke records with 200,000 plus units pre-ordered within 2 days. [26] Samsung Canada stated that pre-orders in Canada were "outstanding". [27] The demand also forced countries like Malaysia, Netherlands, Russia and Ukraine to delay their releases to September due to shortage in supply. TechRadar complimented that the Galaxy Note 7's "rich-looking, glass-and-metal-fused design" would "really wow people who are upgrading from those old, plastic-clad Note 4 and Note 3 handsets", but noted that the curved edges of the screen infrequently caused minor issues when using the stylus. The display was considered to be vibrant and well-suited for multimedia, especially due to its HDR support. Aspects of the software were also praised, including the continued trimming of Samsung's TouchWiz suite and its streamlined settings interface, and that it already included features introduced to the stock operating system as of Android "Nougat" (although still being initially supplied with Android "Marshmallow"). Of the device's new stylus-oriented features, the consolidated S Notes app, GIF recorder, and always-on display functionality were commended, but the translation tool was considered to be inferior to Google Translate. The Galaxy Note 7's battery was judged as being capable of one-and-a-half days of normal use, and it was noted that the software also featured numerous estimation and power-saving features. Techradar concluded that "If you're going to get out of the stylus, the Note 7 is an obvious choice. The iris scanner doesn't make it a convincing enough buy on its own. Otherwise, save your money and stick with the S7 Edge." [16]. Ars Technica was critical of the Note 7 due to its many similarities to the Galaxy S7. The Note 7's refreshed design was commended for being smoother and more ergonomic than previous Samsung devices with curved screens, although the company was panned for using glass on the rear panel rather than metal. The S Pen was also criticized for feeling "cheap", describing it as a "hollow plastic tube that would feel more at home in a 100-pack of disposable Bic pens than in an ultra-premium $850 smartphone". The iris scanner's implementation was panned for adding additional steps to the process of unlocking the phone in comparison to the fingerprint reader, and that it does not integrate into Android's integrated authentication platforms (making it proprietary to Samsung components). Warnings regarding looking at the sensor for too long were also considered to be "just a little scary". TouchWiz on the Note 7 was panned for consisting mainly of "'different for the sake of being different' changes that don't add much to the software experience", and make the interface less consistent with third-party software by removing elements of Material design language. In conclusion, Ars Technica doubted whether the Galaxy Note series was even necessary anymore due to its increasing similarities to the main Galaxy S line, and felt that the device was priced too high, citing Chinese vendors capable of undercutting the prices of major brands while still producing phones of similar specifications. Galaxy Note 7 security bulletin on a Lynx bus in Orlando, Florida. Battery defects caused many Note 7 units to overheat and combust or explode. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] On 10 October 2016, Samsung permanently discontinued the Galaxy Note 7 due to these repeated incidents. In the original run of devices, the battery, produced by a Samsung subsidiary, [38] contained a design flaw that made electrodes on the top-right of the battery susceptible to bending. This weakened separation between positive and negative tabs of the battery, thus leading to thermal runaway and short circuits. Following an official recall on 12 September 2016, [8] the Galaxy Note 7 was re-versioned using batteries from a third-party supplier. [38] Samsung stated on 23 January 2017 that these batteries had suffered from a manufacturing defect in the welding process, which pushed electrodes up and caused damage to the separation between the positive and negative tabs. Some batteries were also missing insulation tape entirely. Samsung reported that these oversights resulted from the vendor's push to ramp up production of batteries for the replacement phones in order to meet demand. On 31 August 2016, it was reported that Samsung was delaying shipments of the Galaxy Note 7 in some regions to perform "additional tests being conducted for product quality"; this came alongside user reports of batteries exploding while charging. [39] On 1 September 2016, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported that Samsung was preparing to recall the device worldwide due to these battery issues. On 2 September 2016, Samsung suspended sales of the Galaxy Note 7 and announced an informal recall , after it was found that a manufacturing defect in the phones' batteries had caused some of them to generate excessive heat, resulting in fires and explosions. recall was announced on 15 September 2016. [7] [8] Samsung exchanged the affected phones for a new revision, which utilized batteries sourced from a different supplier. However, after reports emerged of incidents where these replacement phones also caught on fire, Samsung recalled the Galaxy Note 7 worldwide on 10 October 2016, and permanently ceased production of the device on 11 October. Due to the recalls, Samsung has issued software updates in some markets that are intended to " eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices ", including restricting battery capacity, and blocking their ability to connect to wireless networks.. A company spokesperson stated that it had received 35 reports of battery failure, which "account for less than 0.1 percent of the entire volume sold". [7] [39] Samsung stated that the hazard was limited to a small fraction of phones manufactured, and released a tool on its website on 19 September to identify affected units by their unique IMEI numbers. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an advisory on 8 September 2016, that passengers should not turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft. [41] The European Aviation Safety Agency made a similar statement on 9 September, stating that "passengers are reminded of the need to inform the cabin crew when a device is damaged, hot, produces smoke, is lost, or falls into the seat structure." [42]. On 12 September 2016, the Galaxy Note 7 was officially recalled in the U.S. by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, who advised all owners to shut down and cease all usage of the device, and return them in exchange for a replacement. [8] On 13 September 2016, Samsung announced in newspaper advertisements that it would release a software patch to the affected Galaxy Note 7 devices in South Korea, which prevents the device from being charged beyond 60% capacity to reduce the risk of combustion. The Galaxy Note 7 was subsequently re-issued with batteries supplied by the Chinese company Amperex Technology Limited (which also serves as the main battery supplier for the iPhone line). [38] These replacement models, which Samsung purportedly [45] [46] classified as being safe, had a prominent marking on their packaging to distinguish them from the first wave of recalled units, [47] and render all software battery indicators with green icons. Samsung was granted special permission by Google to allow this change, as it would normally violate the requirements of the Android Compatibility Definition Document (which must be met to license Google Mobile Services software and Android trademarks) [48] for all status bar icons to only be rendered in white. [49] Following the announcement of the recall, Verizon Wireless released a software update to Galaxy Note 7 units purchased from the carrier, which displays the aforementioned green icons on safe devices, and an embedded recall notice on affected devices when the device is plugged in. Unlike the South Korean update, it does not include a charging cut-off. Samsung reported that 80% of devices had been replaced in South Korea, and roughly 50% in Europe and North America. Only 10% [ not in citation given ] of devices in the U.S. were returned, and about 50,000 devices were traded for a different model. However, Samsung stated that 95% of users chose to maintain their loyalty to the company. In October 2016, several incidents occurred in which replacement Galaxy Note 7 phones still suffered from battery failure and combustion. A Galaxy Note 7 owner in Kentucky was hospitalized with acute bronchitis due to smoke inhalation , after his replacement device caught fire in the early morning of 4 October. The owner told a local television station that he had received a text message not meant for him from a Samsung customer service representative, which read "Just now got this. I can try and slow him down if we think it will matter, or we just let him do what he keeps threatening to do and see if he does it". On 5 October 2016, a flight preparing to depart from Louisville was evacuated prior to takeoff when a passenger's replacement Galaxy Note 7, obtained from an AT&T retail outlet, began smoking and popping as they were turning it off. Samsung stated that they were working with Southwest Airlines to investigate the incident, but stated that they would be unable to confirm whether the device was a replacement model until it was recovered. On 7 October 2016, a third replacement phone in Minnesota had reportedly caught fire in a similar manner. A sign at the Air New Zealand check-in counter in Pudong International Airport warning passengers not to bring Note 7 phones onto the plane.. In response to these incidents involving replacement phones, the United States' five major wireless carriers ( AT&T Mobility and T-Mobile US on 9 October, along with Sprint Corporation , Verizon Wireless , and U.S. Cellular on 10 October) subsequently announced that they would suspend sales of the Galaxy Note 7 until further notice, pending an investigation. On 10 October 2016, Samsung officially announced that it had "[asked] all carrier and retail partners globally to stop sales and exchanges" of the Galaxy Note 7, and urged all owners to power them off and "take advantage of the remedies available, including a refund at their place of purchase". [58] On 11 October 2016, Samsung announced that it would permanently end production of the Galaxy Note 7 in the interest of customer safety. [37] [59] Samsung began issuing special kits to package the devices for returns; they consist of an antistatic bag that the phone is to be inserted into, and three layers of boxes—the last of which is lined with ceramic fibre paper for fire protection. The shipping box also contains instructions explicitly stating that they are not to be shipped by air. [60] Samsung stated to Vice 's Motherboard that it would not repair or refurbish any of the returned phones, and that the company would "safely dispose" of them. Following Samsung's actions, the Rwanda Utilities and Regulatory Authority and the United States ' Consumer Product Safety Commission issued official recalls of all units of the Galaxy Note 7. These recalls ban the sale and distribution of any Galaxy Note 7 phone within these countries. [63] [64] [65] The British Royal Mail and British courier company Parcelforce announced that they would not accept or deliver any parcels containing a Galaxy Note 7. needed ] [67] Online marketplaces eBay and Gumtree also began to pull listings selling Galaxy Note 7 devices. [68] After the suspension of sales, Oculus VR issued an update to its software for the Samsung Gear VR virtual reality headset , which blocks its use with the Galaxy Note 7 for safety reasons. The headset had been included with some units of the phone as a promotional offer. On 14 October 2016, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation 's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration banned the Note 7 from being taken aboard any airline flight, even if powered off. [70] [71] Qantas , Virgin Australia and Singapore Airlines issued similar bans, [72] while Transport Canada issued a notice stating that the Galaxy Note 7 was banned from flights under Special Provision 137 prohibitions, banning the carriage of damaged or defective lithium-ion batteries onto flights. [73] In response to these air travel bans, Samsung announced that it would set up dedicated kiosks at selected airports, to allow travelers to exchange or receive a refund for their Galaxy Note 7 on-site before they depart, rather than having their phone confiscated by security or airport staff. In December 2016, a Virgin America flight from San Francisco to Boston was nearly diverted mid flight after it was discovered that a passenger on the plane had been operating a Wi-Fi hotspot with the SSID "Samsung Galaxy Note7_1097". However, it was later discovered that the hotspot was a hoax, and that no passenger had actually brought a Galaxy Note 7 on board. On 4 November 2016, the New Zealand Telecommunications Forum announced that all Galaxy Note 7 phones would be banned from use on local mobile networks beginning 18 November, enforced via IMEI blacklist. [77] On 30 November 2016, Samsung announced that Galaxy Note 7 devices would be banned from Australian wireless networks effective 15 December 2016. In December 2016, Samsung announced its intent to cripple the functionality of unreturned Galaxy Note 7 phones in Canada and the United States via software updates. In Canada, an update restricted charge capacity, and blocked the phone from connecting to any wireless networks, nor use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. In the United States, the update blocked the devices from being recharged in order to " eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices ". Verizon announced that it would refuse to distribute this update due to the "added risk this could pose to Galaxy Note 7 users that do not have another device to switch to" because it would "make it impossible to contact family, first responders or medical professionals in an emergency situation", especially during the holiday season. On 18 December 2016, Verizon announced that they would be distributing the update on 5 January 2017. [82] Sprint also stated that it would not distribute this update until January 2017. [83] Verizon later announced that it would redirect all outgoing calls (excluding emergency calls) made on unreturned Galaxy Note 7 devices to a service hotline demanding that they be returned, and threatened to charge customers a fee equaling the total retail cost of the phone if they refused to comply. On 9 January 2017, Samsung released another update in South Korea, blocking the device from being charged beyond 15%. On 24 March 2017, Samsung released yet another update for South Korea users, barring charging of the Galaxy Note 7. The Verge criticized Samsung's overall handling of the battery faults and recall, arguing that the company had initially delivered unclear messaging over whether the devices were still safe to use, as well as its slow communication with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission , which had the capacity to issue an official recall in the U.S. The arguments were based on data released on 13 September 2016 by the research firm Apteligent , which stated that Galaxy Note 7 usage had been "almost exactly the same" since the announcement of the exchange program. [87] The Verge also noted that the U.S. government's ban on taking Galaxy Note 7 phones aboard airline flights was "perhaps unprecedented", acknowledging that only the ban of hoverboards by individual airlines for similar reasons—an entire class of products (albeit one that was "admittedly fire-prone because of cheap materials")—came close to a legal ban for a single consumer product in terms of overall magnitude. [70] Kyle Weins of Wired.com felt that Samsung switched to non-removable batteries in order to imitate the industrial design of Apple , after having used removable batteries on many of its past models (such as the Galaxy Note 4 ). He argued that this design decision exacerbated the battery faults of the Note 7, by requiring users to replace the entire phone as opposed to just the battery. He suggested that in the future, Samsung could "lead the pack" by switching back to removable batteries, as with other "responsible" OEMs such as HP Inc. Analysts argued that the recall had hurt Samsung's brand, and would likely cause the company to lose its market share to competitors, including Apple and Google (which had recently unveiled their iPhone 7 and Pixel models), and other Android vendors. [37] [59] Credit Suisse analysts predicted that the recall and discontinuation would cause Samsung to lose nearly US$17 billion in revenue. [89] On 12 October 2016, Samsung revised its earnings forecast for the third quarter of 2016, estimating a 33% drop in operating profits in comparison to the second quarter of 2016, and revenue expectations cut by ₩ 2 trillion to ₩47 trillion (US$41.8 billion). On 18 October 2016, McCuneWright LLP sued Samsung and filed a proposed class-action lawsuit over its handling of the recall, stating that the company had "failed to reimburse consumers for monthly costs associated with owning an unusable Note 7". [91] Samsung was also criticized by customers affected by the exploding phones, who alleged that the company was refusing to compensate them for property damage caused by the explosions. In the wake of the recall, Samsung, as well as UL LLC , Exponent , and TÜV Rheinland performed internal testing and analysis to determine the exact causes of the defects. Samsung released its official findings on 23 January 2017. [93] Concurrently, the company announced that all of its future battery-operated products would become subject to an "enhanced" eight-point inspection and testing protocol, including stricter visual inspections, as well as charge and discharge tests, Total Volatile Organic Compound tests, and accelerated usage tests. An advisory board of academics was also formed. Concerns were also raised over the creation of electronic waste resulting from Samsung's announced plan to destroy all returned phones, rather than recycle and refurbish them into new products. [61] [62] In February 2017, Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung had been considering refurbishing the Galaxy Note 7 into a modified version with lower battery capacity, and targeted toward markets such as Vietnam. A representative of Samsung India denied these reports. [95] Greenpeace disrupted a press conference by Samsung at Mobile World Congress to protest the company's unclear plans for the recalled devices. On 27 March 2017, Samsung announced that it now intends to extract reusable parts such as metal, semiconductors, and cameras from the recalled devices, and market refurbished devices "where applicable". After the discontinuation of the Note 7, some features in the device (such as Samsung Pass, Secure Folder, S Pen related features, and Grace UX) were eventually made available in Marshmallow (e.g. Galaxy A8 (2016) , Galaxy A (2017) series and Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2016)) and Nougat (e.g. Galaxy Note 5 (via software update), Galaxy S8/S8+ and Galaxy C Pro series). In June 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported on Samsung's plan to refurbish its inventory of recalled phones and release them with a new model designation of Galaxy Note FE, with the "FE" referencing "Fan Edition." The phone was also rumored to be named as the Note 7R, with the R referencing "refurbished". This phone was released on the 7th of July in South Korea, with limited availability in other countries to follow, and a price of $610; being a $255 discount from the price of the Note 7. The Fan Edition has a smaller battery of 3200 mAh and multiple safety features. It has a "Fan Edition" logo on the back. The software is identical to that of the S8. It has a similar UI and includes Bixby home and reminders but not the whole Bixby assistant. [99] [100] Samsung introduced an 8-Point battery check after the Note7 to make sure all of their batteries are safe for new and current devices in production. There have been no reported incidents of an S8/S8+ catching fire after their release as the first new flagship device to go through the 8-Point battery check. There have been no reported incidents of the successor Note8 catching fire either. After the Fan Edition has launched in South Korea , the Galaxy Note FE has also been launched in selected countries in Asia and Saudi Arabia starting from October 2017. As of December 2017, there is no word on the Note FE being released to other countries.. ^ "Samsung Galaxy Note7 Teardown". Retrieved 22 October 2016. ^ "Samsung Galaxy Note Fan Edition Teardown".

Guest Quick Reply (no urls or BBcode). The following errors occurred with your submission. By zamzenos , Senior Member on 29th July 2017, 06:01 PM. The Note FE comes with dm-verity check and forced encryption enabled. You will need to remove this extra layer of security for root access. To disable dm-verity and forced encryption you must install TWRP recovery first on your Note FE. Note that disabling forced encryption and dm-verity requires a factory reset from TWRP recovery, so you should backup your data (internal storage) before you begin. The next stage then will be to root the device by flashing the SuperSU zip via TWRP recovery. SU will also ensure that dm-verity and forced encryption remains disabled. Bear in mind, however, that a factory reset will restore them again. Download Odin and drivers here: https://build.nethunter.com/samsung-tools/. Download TWRP for Note 7 Exynos: there are two versions: Korean and International:. Download the latest version of SuperSu here: https://download.chainfire.eu/1021/S...etrieve_file=1. You should also download the stock firmware appropriate to your version of Note FE, just in case. Variants S & L can be found on Sammobile, and variant K is available here: https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=817550096634784008. Read these instructions through carefully before you begin. (1) Install TWRP Recovery on your Note FE via Odin. (2) Boot your Note FE into TWRP recovery as follows:. (a) First switch off your device. (b) Now Press and hold “Home + Power + Volume Up” buttons for a few seconds and as soon as you see your device’s logo on-screen, release the three buttons altogether. Your device will boot into TWRP recovery. (3) Upon booting into TWRP recovery for the first time, you’ll get a prompt to allow system modifications. You should swipe right to allow this. (4) On the TWRP main menu, select WIPE then select “Format Data”. You will need to type yes in order to proceed. This will clean wipe the entire internal storage on your Note FE (make sure you have backed-up your important files safe to restore later). (5) Still in TWRP recovery, you should now connect your Note FE to the PC. (TWRP supports MTP connection so you’ll be able transfer files to the device.) Wait until your Note FE appears on your PC desktop (may take a while first time). You can now transfer the SuperSU zip to your Note FE. (6) Go back to the TWRP main menu and select “Install” this time. Now you can flash the SuperSU zip. It would be helpful to others if you reported your experience and the outcome here.

Samsung Galaxy Note FE - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 32 33 ». In Malaysia set, it has Samsung logo in front... Because in other countries, it doesn't have logo in front... Samsung from Malaysia are the 'BEST'... I don't know why they choose this.... murphey, 20 Feb 2018 should i buy note fe or A8 You should buy note FE. Hdhd, 23 Feb 2018 Can you tell us your experience using note fe? I'm very happy with the phone. I have been using it for 3 weeks. My first day i got a little disappointed with the battery because it seem to drain fast but it last 6hs screen on, so it wasn't bad. I finish my day with at least 40% of battery, some days it last 2 days. Everything is great, the phone works perfectly, I like the camera, the phone is beautiful i also use the live message that is supposed to be only for the Note 8. I have a Note 4 so I was used to use the S pen. I like the screen 16:9, better than the 18'5:9. This phone is half the price than the Note 8.. This phone is everything I can ask for, descent RAM & internal memory, great feeling when gripping, beautiful design, nice camera & features, also nice original flip cover & headset. For work, it's good to have synchronized s-note which I can write on my tab, another plus point if pairing with Samsung stylus MH5100. Performance is very good to switch between apps like excel, word or any messaging tools. Excellent stylus response in drawing apps like Autodesk Sketchbook, very acurate & convenient to use, no lag or delays in sketching. Good to capture sudden ideas when brainstorming. Good security, it has iris scanner & finger print scanner. Secure folder to keep whatever private. Overall it is one of my EDC that quite satisfied me since Note 7.. Hdhd, 23 Feb 2018 Can you tell us your experience using note fe? I think it is a great phone for me,the performance are good ,launch social apps just take a second just a bit lag like during multitasking (like open about 10 apps and may suffer a bit lag which annoys even when email)but got few refresh in multitasking like 1 or maximum 2 app,s pen is good for me to draw something or plan things or mind mapping(i am student)even translate directly by hover on the word,i think daily use are great.Camera is outstnading good in low light capture whole article by use this only take few seconds as fast autofocus available in this device colour production also great and just lack of potrait mode,if got i think it is perfect.Battery life one and a half day till 2 days for me and charge only takes about 100 minutes,okay for me.

Hdhd, 23 Feb 2018 Can you tell us your experience using note fe? I bought an indonesian Note FE model 2 weeks ago. For me it's a cheaper alternative for note 8, with almost all note 8 feature for almost half the price, i can even use live message and paragraph translate on Note FE using the Note 8 app apk. The only missing feature in note FE is Dual Camera, Infinity Display, Bixby Voice and Bixby Camera. The only bad about note FE is the battery life, you will have need to charge it midday. Personally i love my FE, and for me Note FE is more appealing visually than Note 8, i had the black onyx its super sexy and professional looking, even might be the best mobile phone look ever made not even joking..

Samsung Galaxy Note FE (Fan Edition) Review. by Maxwell Ramsey. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 2 Interface, Functionality, Performance and Connectivity. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Samsung Galaxy Note Fan Edition specifications. Camera An outstanding sensor with processing that works harder than it needs to We are reunited with the same 12-megapixel camera that we have seen on last year’s, and this year’s Samsung flagships. Despite having the new Samsung Experience UI, and Bixby on board, the Note FE’s camera interface is not updated with added features like Bixby Vision, or the ability to apply an animal mask to people’s faces. That does not detract from the reality, however, that the images captured by the Note FE are wonderful, as we have come to expect from Samsung. Post-processing seems to favor over-sharpening, but just as often as not, you have to zoom in to really see it. In darker conditions, the F1.7 aperture lends a hand in bringing plenty of ambient light into the picture, a feature we praised in our review last year. Like any smartphone camera, even with OIS, things can get a little fuzzy, but for the masses (or the few, really), the Note FE takes pictures that rival any flagship, past or present. The front-facing 5-megapixel camera does not break any new ground, it has a wide field of view, so selfies are no problem. Wanting to spare the readership of images dominated by my ugly mug, I took it upon myself to find some people to take “us-ies” instead, with a family visiting California’s Capitol, and a couple CHP officers making the rounds. Plus, it gave an excuse to also try a selfie stick. Even with very bright sunlight conditions creating sharp changes between shadows and light, the camera performed well. Video The camera brings much of that same photographic competence to video recording as well. The Note FE records 4K video at 30 frames-per-second. You can also record 2K video at 30 fps. FHD video can be recorded at 30 or 60 fps. Certain features like image stabilization, video effects, and tracking auto-focus are not available when recording in the higher resolution settings. Multimedia Ideal for consuming video content, speaker is weak sauce The beautiful 5.7-inch AMOLED display makes the Note FE ideal when it comes to taking in video content. With support for HDR10, you can harness more enriching goodies as providers like Netflix expand their offerings. The single bottom-mounted speaker is barely adequate, and in order to hear anything, you really need to hammer the volume rocker. The sounds are clear, and there is nothing in the way of distortion, but among the current crop of available devices, the Note FE’s speaker does not shine. On the flip side of that, audio through the 3.5mm headphone jack works just fine.. Samsung Galaxy Note Fan Edition sample images. Samsung Galaxy Note Fan Edition sample images.

And by now those specs are 2016. I don't understand this score thing. But it's not accurate at all. (Posts: 463; Member since: 14 Feb 2016). posted on 25 Jul 2017, 08:55. I don't care what any biased Samsung fanboy says, but this is unacceptable. This was mentioned in the S8+ review as well. Samsung must figure out a way to fix this issue. The FE is far too expensive to stutter when gaming. My 6P from 2 years ago doesn't do this, and it has a weaker chip.

I believe some PA posters are literally paid Samsung reps. I don't know how many times I must explain this simple concept. Some phones have a greater degree of lag. Some phones have such a great degree of lag in which it's declared an issue. If a review notices lag/stutter, there is most likely an issue as this observation has been tested in various scenarios. Multiple reputable sources mention gaming lag on many Galaxy reviews. This is an issue, not just the phone lagging in one occurrence..

It continues to baffle me how much people rag on the site, writers, review scores, other commenters, yet come back regularly and comment at length.

If you have saved $1 for every time you have written 'lag' on phonearena.com, you would have saved more than a million dollar. Is it some kind of kick for you to write lag and samsung in the same sentence every time?. Even if s8, note 7 lags as you say, they are still very good smartphones. If an iphone user can live with retina display in 2017, a Samsung user can also live with occasional stutter..

Doesn't change the fact I'd like Samsung to improve its lag/stutter situation. We are both on a mobile tech blog right? Nothing about this suggests we aren't living our lives lol..

Don't you get bored writing same point again and again?. Considering the fact you are nexus user, you shouldn't be worried about samsung's device so much. If in the future samsung can fix its ' tremendously lagging devices' you can switch from nexus and buy a samsung device. But writing same thing on phonearena.com every other day, will not help you or samsung or anyone. That is why i said get some life and stop worrying about samsung's lag so much..

Samsung Galaxy Note FE arrives in the PH, priced at PHP 32,990. Samsung finally launched the much-awaited Galaxy Note Fan Edition, commonly called as Galaxy Note FE, in the Philippines. As a refresher, the newly-announced Galaxy Note FE is the refurbished Galaxy Note7, which has a tragic history due to exploding batteries.. After months of speculations, the Samsung Galaxy Note Fan Edition has finally arrived on the shores of the Philippines. Please note, though, that the newly-announced device, usually called as the Galaxy Note FE, is the refurbished Galaxy Note7 which was known for its tragic past. You might ask, "Will the Galaxy Note FE still sell out despite the fiasco it caused last year?" Well, there's still some who are willing to forget its terrible history and focus on what the refurbished phone can offer now. Also, Samsung surely checked the handset before launching it to avoid having the same mistake again which caused the loss of a lot of its sales as well as damaged its reputation.. For instance, the Galaxy Note FE has gone through Samsung's new 8-Point Battery Safety Check, developed to ensure that there will be no exploding and catching fire batteries in the future. Furthermore, the South Korean tech giant integrated a smaller battery to the refurbished smartphone, suggesting that the company has already learned its lesson. The new device only packs a 3200 mAh battery, a downgrade from the Galaxy Note7's larger 3500 mAh cell.. Apparently, the rest of the specs are identical to the ill-fated handset. Samsung's Galaxy Note FE sports a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels and a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on top for protection. Powering the phone is the tech firm's in-house Exynos 8890 chipset clocked at 2.3 GHz and coupled with Mali-T880 MP12 GPU. It packs 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of built-in storage which supports an expandable memory of up to 256 GB via microSD card. Camera-wise, the device features a 12 MP rear snapper with f/1.7 aperture, phase detection autofocus, OIS, and LED flash. It also comes with a 5 MP selfie shooter with a f/1.7 aperture up front. As for the platform, it runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat out-of-the-box. It costs PHP 32,990 and is now available for purchase in all Samsung's concept stores for a limited time only..

Samsung Galaxy Note FE Review. 5.7-inch Super AMOLED Display 12-Megapixel Rear Camera 3200mAh Li-Ion Non-removable Battery Samsung Galaxy Note FE Dubai Price IP68 certified for dust and water resistance Latest Android operating system right out of the box Great rear camera It’s still expensive Battery is smaller than the original Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Only one storage option (there is a microSD card slot). The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is back with a new name and a new battery titled as the Samsung Galaxy Note FE or Fan Edition. All the Note series fans were really disappointed after Samsung Galaxy Note 7 nightmare as it was one of the most anticipated phones of 2016. Now, to find out all about the changes inside this new version and the Samsung Galaxy Note FE Dubai price, keep reading.. It’s the same old Samsung Galaxy Note 7 we are talking about and there is no visible change. We get the same 5.7-inch display showing 2560 x 1440 pixels resolution and 515ppi of pixel density. That’s not necessarily a bad thing as everyone loved the display. The resolution is set to 1080p by default and users have to switch to 2K or 720p depending on what they prefer. Just like the original version, the phone will support Qi wireless charging. It will be available in four different colors: black onyx, gold platinum, silver titanium and blue coral.. The original Samsung Galaxy Note 7 got the same camera as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and that’s what we get in the Galaxy Note Fan Edition. Although there is no change in the camera, it will get the job done perfectly. For those of you who are interested to get the best camera focused phone, there is the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus or the iPhone 7 Plus. The camera comes with Dual Pixel autofocus feature which results to faster and accurate focus. On the front side, it’s a 5-megapixel camera with auto HDR and dual video call features. There are better camera focused phones out there available at the same pricing range as the Samsung Galaxy Note FE Dubai price but none of those phones includes the S-Pen.. This is where things are different compared to the original Samsung Galaxy Note 7, the battery size. It’s a smaller 3200mAh battery with fast charging support. Under the hood, it’s the same Exynos 8890 octa-core processor paired with 4GB of RAM. It’s definitely not at par compared to other phones released this year but it does offer smooth Android Nougat 7.1.1 performance. There is a microSD card slot for expanding storage which is necessary as the built-in storage is only 64GB. It’s the S Pen that makes this phone different than the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and it’s more accurate than before with new features and updates. It’s definitely the phone to go for if you are not interested to wait for the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and want the latest phone in this series.. The Samsung Galaxy Note FE has been released in South Korea recently and is expected to be available globally soon. We don’t know what will be the price here yet but it will be around AED 2400 after the Samsung Galaxy Note FE release date UAE.. Things we loved about the Samsung Galaxy Note FE:.

The Galaxy Note 7 took Samsung's best phone to date, the S7 Edge, stretched it to a 5.7-inch curved display and added an S Pen stylus. It has the same top-of-the-line camera and specs, but was meant for big hands with equally big wallets. Unfortunately, two recalls lead to its ultimate cancellation.. Here's how to get a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 replacement Release date and price August 19 in the US for about $33 a month August 19 in Australia for AU$1,349 September 2 in the UK for £749 Design Stylish curved glass design with Gorilla Glass 5 Hot new Coral Blue shade is one of four colors USB Type-C, microSD card slot and IP68 waterproof Display Spacious 5.7-inch AMOLED screen is the world's best on a phone Mobile HDR future-proofs the display with expanded contrast ratio Fewer false touches, but sensitive capacitive buttons are annoying S Pen and GIF maker Samsung's stylus embeds right in the phone for easy carrying Off-screen memos can capture thoughts, even if the display is unlit Can create and edit animated GIFs from non-DRM videos Iris scanner With your eyes, unlock your phone and specific apps, files and photos Second security layer allows you to share lockscreen code with kids Doesn't replace the more reliable home button fingerprint sensor You often exit a swimming pool or shower with incredible pruny hands and desperately need to check your phone Your fingers are grasping the middle of this really big phone, unable to make it down to the home button You want a second biometrically controlled way of accessing certain files and folders, far from your phone prying, Pokemon Go-playing kids Your friends want you to unlock the phone from the bar stool next to you You want a new party trick because no one fancies your smartwatch. Update: The official cause of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 battery explosions has been announced, with a two reasons being the recalls. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is rumored to be ready to write the wrongs of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall, one of the biggest fails of 2016. That's good news because last year's twice-recalled Android phone has ceased to function due to its exploding battery. Updates have forced it to stop charging and make calls , yet, shockingly, 'thousands' of Verizon customers in the US are still using the Note 7. We're ready for Samsung's attempt at a comeback story at MWC 2017 .. Note from the editor: You should stop using the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and return is immediately. Although it scored an impressive 4.5 stars in its in-depth TechRadar review and we experienced no significant problems, Samsung has recalled all Galaxy Note 7 handsets , including the “safe” replacements it sent out that can also pose a danger. The South Korean firm has ceased production on the phone.. Samsung is offering to compensation toward your next phone, even helping you pay for an iPhone. You should take advantage of that, as it's now illegal to US flights. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is the large-screen phone for 2016 that Android power users have been anxiously waiting to upgrade to, and it takes several cues from the Galaxy S7 Edge .. Sure, the S7 Edge already stretched our fingertips into near-phablet territory with a 5.5-inch display in March. But it didn't have two Note-series staples: a 5.7-inch screen and the S Pen.. The Note 7 maximizes the screen space, while minimizing its body, and it includes a small stylus that slides right into the phone – no matter which way you put it in this time.. All of this makes it larger and heavier than most of today's phones. But it's a worthy trade-off if you can wrap your meaty paws around its elegantly curved glass and aluminum frame.. Returning features include a microSD card slot for extra storage, absent from last year's Galaxy Note 5, and an IP68 water-resistance rating, normally limited to the S range, which makes this first Note phone that's both waterproof and dustproof to a point.. New in the Note 7 is an iris scanner, Samsung's latest novelty act and your next party trick. You never knew you needed to unlock your phone with your eyes – and, truthfully, you really don't. The fingerprint sensor is still here and works just fine.. This now-launching Android phablet is especially anticipated in the UK and Europe – the S Pen upgrade is long overdue there. Samsung made the bizarre decision not to launch the Note 5 outside of the US and a few other countries.. Skipping over the Samsung Galaxy Note 6 name, the Note 7 is meant to bring it into line with the Galaxy S7 series – and steal the thunder of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus .. It's certainly among the best phones available right now, big or small. Let's take a look to see if the sizable Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is the right fit for you.. The S Pen works no matter which way you slide it in now. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 release date is August 19 in the US and Australia, and September 2 in the UK. Don't worry, it's coming this time. Pre-orders In the UK launch earlier last week, August 16.. In the US, it costs between $33 and $36.67 a month on device payment plans with AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile or Sprint. That's basically the full price spread out over 24 months. Without a contract, it's anywhere from $850 (T-Mobile and Sprint) to $880 (AT&T). Sprint is the only one offering old two-year contracts in exchange for $350 upfront. Samsung is likely to wait four months for a SIM-free unlocked Note 7, just like it did with the S7 Edge.. The Note 7 UK price is simpler, but still expensive at £749. In Australia, it's pricey, too, at AU$1,349. But if you pre-ordered in certain stores, you'd receive a bonus: either a Samsung Gear Fit 2 fitness tracker or a Samsung 256GB microSD card, your choice. Shop around to see if that's still available.. You best like futuristic-looking edge-to-edge displays, because this screen wraps around the left and right sides of the handset with space-age curved glass. No, there's no flat Note 7, grandpa.. The dual curved edges come to the Note 7. It's a lot like the equally-stylish S7 Edge, only this phone has a slightly bigger 5.7-inch display. It comes together in a rich-looking, glass-and-metal-fused design that's going to really wow people who are upgrading from those old, plastic-clad Note 4 and Note 3 handsets. Next to the similarly designed Note 5, it's less breakable, too, thanks to an upgrade to Gorilla Glass 5. It's still heavy compared to Samsung's flagship S series, but it's a tad lighter and noticeably slimmer than the Note 5.. What really makes the Note 7 superior is its gentler dual curved sides. Both the front and the back of the phone slope inward toward its frame, meeting at its metal band apex. The curves aren't as pronounced as the S7 Edge's one big curve, which boldly slopes the front glass all the way to its nearly flat back. But with a more dramatic curve comes more drama in the way of more false touches.. Thankfully, falses touches haven't been as much of a problem on the Note 7, despite its larger size. It usually worked the opposite way in the past – bigger phones made our hands creep up on the non-existent bezels and we used to hit all sorts of crazy keyboard interference. If you're still having issues touching the side, we recommend searching for a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 case.. We did still run into the issue of accidentally hitting the very sensitive capacitive buttons that no case can fix. The back and recent buttons flank the physical home button, and pretty much everyone we hand this phone to touches them only to immediately exit the screen we were trying to show off. It's rather annoying, but present on all Samsung Galaxy phones except for the S6 Active and S7 Active, which use physical soft buttons.. There are four Note 7 colors that vary by region: Black Onyx, Titanium Silver, Gold Platinum and the hot new color, Coral Blue. The UK, for example, is only getting Black and Blue initially. Samsung made a point that every phone has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a not-so-subtle jab at Apple, as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus might not have the ubiquitous audio port.. Samsung did make one important switch at the bottom of the Note 7, however: it's using the reversible USB Type-C connection instead of the insufferable, non-reversible micro USB port. This makes life easier when plugging in the phone, except you're going to have to carry around a micro USB cable for many gadgets that won't upgrade to the new standard for years. GoPro is the best example, as they only recently made the switch from USB mini in the GoPro Hero4 Session variant. Even Samsung's own fast wireless charging pad sent to us along with the Note 7 uses micro USB. It's going to be a while for USB-C to fully to kick in.. The Note 7 has a larger screen as the S7 Edge to go along with that same color-rich Super AMOLED panel and pixel-dense 2K resolution. It's perfect for the new Samsung Gear VR and also supports Mobile HDR.. The world's best display on a phone. Let's be honest, 0.2 inches of additional screen space doesn't make a tremendous difference in a world where the 5.5-inch S7 Edge exists. It's just a hair better for reading a few more words without scrolling, gaming with a smidge more room for on-screen controls without dying, and watching a 12-hour Netflix binge without feeling as badly for not stopping. It's not your fault, it's the immersive screen!. Mobile HDR, on the the hand, allows for darker blacks and brighter whites, and it's more meaningful than any size increase or jumping to a 4K resolution. It'll be up to Netflix, Amazon Prime and other popular services to deliver more content with the expanded contrast ratio. Right now, movies and TV shows with HDR are extremely limited and hard to find (often without proper labels). In the case of Netflix, HDR costs $2 a month on top of your current subscription. So the screen isn't just futuristic-looking, it's future-proof.. Off-screen memos return from the Note 5. No need to open an app or even turn on the screen. What you can enjoy right now from the screen are off-screen memos using the S Pen and an always-on display that shows the time, date, battery life and notification icons, even when the rest of the screen is asleep. An always-on display is new to the Note series and was a big hit on the S7 and S7 Edge. A few improvements have been made in the past five months. There are more color options and background choices, and more notification icons are supported.. There's another reason the Note 7 edges don't slope so dramatically: this phone is designed to use the tiny Samsung's S Pen stylus, which has always made the Note series business-friendly. On occasion, drawing on the sides did mess up our critical business memos (aka our Snapchat game), but those instances were few and far between. It's a happy medium between fashion and functionality.. Want a phone with a stylus? This is the one (and pretty much the only). We relish the fact that Samsung chose to roll all S Pen notes into one S Notes app, unlike the splintered apps on the Note 5, and that off-screen memos return for jotting down notes on the unlit screen as soon as the embedded pen is unshethed, just like the Note 5. That's great for penciling in a quick groceries list without ever opening up an app or your phone.. And now the S Pen is for more than for taking quick memos. New to the stylus' capabilities is a GIF maker. It allows you to record just about any moving image and turn it into an animated GIF. You can't record copyright-protected footage from streaming services like Google Play or Netflix (we tried), just like you can't take a mid-movie screenshot. But we were able to pull off an animated GIF of The Simpsons care of an episode uploaded to YouTube. We then edited the GIF frame by frame (to axe the frames that had the YouTube pause button overlaid on top of it in the beginning) and sent it to a TechRadar colleague. It elicited the intended hahahaha response. There's a new GIF maker that's fun to use. Other S Pen capabilities include Screen Select for clipping portions of the screen with lasso tools, Screen Write for annotating screenshots, and newcomers Translate and Magnify. Hovering over foreign text word-by-word with the S Pen's Translate is a letdown when the far more comprehensive Google Translate exists, though we did find uses Magnify when photos and text were too small. Old people who whip out a magnifying glass to look at receipts will love this on their phone.. The iris scanner won't, or shouldn't, sell you on the Note 7. It's not the breakthrough eye scanning technology that replaces the fingerprint sensor home button like you may be thinking at first pass, and to be fair, Samsung isn't marketing it as such.. The iris scanner won't replace your fingerprint. Instead, it's a supplemental way to unlock your phone or password protect folders, apps and photos behind a second layer of security. This is a great idea for parents who are forced (read: guilted and/or tortured) into giving their kids their password for playing game apps (read again: Pokemon Go). They won't have full access to your Secure Folder.. Here are the rare, but actual uses of the iris scanner:. The iris scanner worked well enough for us and even worked in the dark. It's not faster than putting your finger on the home button, but it's close enough and it can be a neat party trick. Only, be warned, the scanner shows an unflattering, low-resolution sliver of your face in black-and-white when it tries to read your eyes. It can be (and was) a party trick gone wrong when we tried it the first time at a party. The phone managed still to unlock our sad face, so that's good news.. Next Page What's it like to use?.
