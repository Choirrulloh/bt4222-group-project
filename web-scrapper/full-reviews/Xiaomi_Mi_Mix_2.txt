White version: 18K PVD rose gold coating camera and fingerprint. All screen, all the time – that was the philosophy behind the Xiaomi Mi Mix , one of last yearâs hottest smartphones. Coming before offerings from Samsung and LG , it was Xiaomi that made such a big deal about having a minimal bezel display that we all had to pay attention. Naturally, expectations are a little high for the followup to a phone that tried to put just a screen in your hands. This is our full review of the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2.. Buy Mi Mix 2 on eBay. The first thing that most people will notice is the different size. Minimal bezels are generally supposed to help with the handling of a larger screen, but the original Mi Mix opted for a super-sized screen that wasnât very easy to handle with one hand. That changes this time with a 5.99-inch IPS LCD display that minimizes what already prioritizes minimalism. As a result, the phone is easier to grip and keep from slipping about despite the ceramic body.. We love that Xiaomi is sticking to making ceramic phone bodies.. We love that Xiaomi is sticking to making ceramic phone bodies, and that the Mi Mix 2 continues this pleasing design trope. The back shines beautifully, with few elements breaking up the sheen. The fingerprint reader is found in an optimal place, just below the companyâs simple but dramatic branding. The Mix 2 is easier to hold because of the smaller size, as we mentioned before, but also because of the rounded sides and edges that can actually be gripped this time around.. The curves make this phone look quite different from its predecessor, and not necessarily for the better. Xiaomiâs freshman attempt had a more square, angular look. It was an attractive take on the all-screen philosophy. Now, we have a phone that might seem pretty familiar to anyone that is used to current high screen-to-body ratio smartphones.. Over 80% of the front is taken up by that IPS display.. Over 80% of the front is taken up by that IPS display, and it stretches up to the very top of the phone. This is still a wonderful look that avoids the divots and notches that we see from the likes of Essential and the iPhone X.. However, the same compromise that helped make the front of the original Mi Mix a reality is back. The front facing camera is located in the bottom corner of the phone in one of the most awkward positions that weâve ever seen. Not only is it incredibly easy to cover up the camera with oneâs right hand, it makes for an odd angle that will annoy selfie experts. Sure, the camera app tells the user to turn the phone upside down for more conventional self-portraits, but that is not an option when using apps like Instagram and Snapchat.. Other compromises were actually mitigated this time around. The ultrasonic proximity sensor returns but is no longer accompanied by a vibration speaker found underneath the surface for calls. Now, there is a very small slit at the very top of the device that houses an actual phone speaker. It is a small driver that points upward and it already sounds much better than last yearâs alternative.. Unlike the original Mi Mix, the Mi Mix 2 has a very small slit at the very top of the screen that houses an actual phone speaker.. While we think that the Mi Mix originalâs lack of curves made for a more enticing design, we canât deny that the new edition still rocks the all-display really well. We still miss the headphone jack and still donât like the front facing camera placement, though.. What I really wish is that I was able to review the unibody ceramic version of this phone, which comes in both black and this incredible white color. Xiaomi claims that the white version is a lot like a perfect piece of jade, and it is definitely the edition of the Mix 2 that I would rock because it looks crazy good.. That IPS display does soften the blow a little, because it remains a wonderful viewing experience. The Mi Mix from last year was bucking a lot of trends in the Android space, bringing completely different aspect ratios to the operating system that were, at first, rejected by Google. But now that 18:9 aspect ratios are all the rage, the Mix 2 is afforded a good position to insert itself into the greater Android game.. This display is quite good to handle, though getting up and down the phone will still require hand gymnastics. The screen’s brightness is about where it should be even in daylight situations, though colors are just a little less saturated than its LED counterparts. You can change the color profile in the settings, and there is a reading mode included for lowering the blue light during the twilight hours.. Xiaomiâs only misstep is going with Full HD+ rather than Quad HD resolution.. Xiaomiâs only misstep with the screen here is making it Full HD+ rather than springing for Quad HD resolution. While the experience has still been great for gaming, media consumption, and all textual elements, that extra bit of clarity just keeps this phone from being squarely in the flagship pack.. The internal specs really make this phone shine, even underneath its gorgeous ceramic body. The Snapdragon 835 is accompanied with either 6 or 8 GB of RAM that come at different price points. Storage isn’t a problem for this phone, despite the lack of a microSD card slot, either, as 64/128/256 GB storage options are available.. The internal specs really make this phone shine, and as this is a global-ready phone, Google Play Services are pre-installed.. I had no problem with the everyday performance with the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2, zipping between applications despite the actual software itself remaining a bit rough around the edges. As this is a global-ready phone, Google Play Services were pre-installed on this device and didnât have to be injected after the fact like with the original Mi Mix.. The Mi Mix 2 has the most radios of any smartphone in the world.. Another factor that we were happy to see addressed this time around is the phoneâs ability to work anywhere outside of China. The Mi Mix 2 has the most radios of any smartphone and is compatible with just about any band for voice and data throughout the world.. It was refreshing to use this phone with US LTE networks and not have to rely on slower HSPA+ speeds. When using the phone on my T-Mobile account, I also had no problems with calls and call quality on the GSM network, as sound came through nice and clear thanks to the new earpiece speaker.. Sound in other situations is a bit of a mixed bag, unfortunately – without a headphone jack, users are again forced to use a USB Type-C adapter to use wired headphones with the Mi Mix 2. While there are settings in the phone that help enhance the listening experience, it mostly requires use of Xiaomiâs own headphones to take advantage of it.. Sound in other situations is a bit of a mixed bag, unfortunately.... That was not as upsetting as the external speaker, however, which was an uneven experience. It seemed that, at volumes lower than 50%, the speaker was tuned to have a noise gate. Quieter sound seemed to drop off the spectrum so that there was a noticeable separation between it and louder parts of the audio. It was just noticeable enough to be annoying.. The speakers will get the job done, but this phone feels like itâs begging you to use wireless headphone solutions at all times.. Battery life was, like last year, a bright spot of the Mi Mix experience. While last year I could have attributed this to the lack of LTE connectivity, this yearâs Mi Mix manages to last just as long. I got an average of 5 hours screen-on-time throughout 12+ hour workdays, some as long as 16 hours non-stop. Despite the large screen that takes up most of the body, the Full HD+ resolution helps a bit by being less power hungry. Nonetheless, getting power back isnât a big deal with Quick Charge 3.0, which can top it up in no time.. Xiaomi decided to keep a surprisingly conventional camera experience compared to their competitors, at least on its back.. The rear camera is a 12 MP shooter that boasts 4-axis optical stabilization and not too much else. While the stabilization does help with some of the up-to-4K video capture modes and a bit better low light shooting, it is just about the only thing special about the camera. The app is still the same as before with no new modes. A manual mode does help with some deeper tweaking of the settings for specific results.. Pictures in general are pretty good, though itâs no surprise that it all kind of falls apart in low light. The HDR capture does help with exposure in lower light situations but it requires a longer shutter release and thus shutter to file speeds slow down pretty significantly. On that topic, the HDR setting is a toggle on the camera app rather than automatic like on plenty of other flagship devices. Hand-Held Twilight (HHT) mode produces decently crisp low light exposures although they do tend to be darker than HDR shots.. The front facing camera goes past unconventional and becomes downright odd.. The front facing camera goes past unconventional and becomes downright odd. I do a lot of video calls these days and this was where I found the camera positioning less than ideal.. When talking with someone and looking at their video feed, it makes you look like you are looking up and away from your subject, which is normally mitigated by more typical camera placements. Making the effort to look down at the corner usually meant that I also had to hold the phone in my left hand, because my palm would likely cover up and block the camera.. My other annoyance with the camera is that it is a bit too narrow – it just isnât very wide at all, so it wonât capture much more than your head and very little of the background. The camera placement is uncomfortable as is , but adding the need to stretch oneâs arm out in order to get more in the frame is even more awkward.. For those reasons, p ictures coming out of the front facing camera, are rarely very good. Add to that the fact that you canât use the camera upside down in apps like Instagram and Snapchat and you can see why the Mix 2 is definitely not my favorite selfie experience.. The camera did nothing to blow me away, even though I used it as a vlogging rig around Beijing. Some pictures came out really well, but plenty of others left quite a bit to be desired. I am inclined to say the camera is pretty average, especially since Xiaomi is trying much harder on their other phones with dual cameras.. Xiaomi is trying much harder on their other phones with dual cameras.. Which brings us to the software and MIUI. MIUI is the backbone of Xiaomi and was the starting point of their success, so itâs not surprising that they continue to tweak and improve it as much as possible. Unfortunately, that doesnât quite feel like the case here, as the software on the Mi Mix 2 feels really similar to previous versions of MIUI I experienced on the Mi 6 and the previous Mi Mix. That said, it is great that Xiaomi already included Google Play Services on my unit, which is important to have on a phone that is supposed to work outside of China.. MIUI still boasts quite a few features though. The Quick Ball is a small, convenient way of getting to core functions without relying on the soft keys. Dual App allows for multiple instances of the same application if you need to access two different accounts or experiences. Second Space can take that even further, by basically making a whole new second account that you can put together from scratch.. The main issues that I have with the software are ones Iâve had before, and they all have to do with polish.. Parts of the OS donât seem to be completely finished or translated properly from Chinese and notifications in particular show up in odd ways – the heads up notifications donât show any of the actual information and when looking at them in the notification menu, expanding puts much of the information too far down the screen.. The software on this phone is just short of ready for primetime outside China.. MIUI has come a long way and continues to be supported by the user forum community, meaning updates can come quickly. However, that doesnât really excuse the bits of polish that are still missing even after a couple generations of Mi devices Iâve reviewed. That many of my critical apps, like Instagram, froze up and eventually crashed makes it clear that the software on this phone is just short of ready for primetime outside China.. All in all, the main problem the Mi Mix 2 is that the things its predecessor did differently are now standard in the smartphone world. The original Mi Mix was co-opted by the Essential Phone, among others, and we are seeing a move toward the phone’s 2:1 aspect ratio (well, 17:9 but close enough) , along. with minimal bezel displays, across the industry.. Xiaomi has done well to stick to its design guns in keeping the phone not only ceramic, but very similar to the minimalist and honestly beautiful original Mi Mix, albeit with more curves and a smaller overall body. If you want your Mi Mix 2 to be as unique as possible though, you might want to spring for the white unibody ceramic edition. Because the internals and the overall user experience of the Mi Mix 2 donât set it apart from other high end Chinese devices and certainly other better known flagship smartphones. That special edition of the phone does come in at an equivalent of $720 US, making it the most expensive phone of the bunch.. However, the 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage model is just over $600, making it at least a few hundred dollars lower in price compared to plenty of other recent flagship devices. Depending on your stance regarding the lower resolution display, the single camera, and the Chinese software experience, that might be one hell of a steal.. It wouldn’t shock us if you wanted to go back to the phone that got us all really wanting all screen all the time – at least if you’re able to get your hands on it.. Buy Mi Mix 2 on eBay.

Too costly for this features of CHINESE phone!!!. By Srinivas Prmbdr | 11 Oct 2017. This phone should have been priced around 15000/- to 20,000/- but they put price as 35999/-. For this range one can get APPLE 7 or Samsung 7 mobiled which are lot better than this device. So, this device is not at all worth buying.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 6 out of 17 people found this review helpful. By Adonai Krause | 8 Nov 2017. The Snapdragon 835 and Ceramic Back are nice and dandy, but, to my eyes, This is by far the most beautiful phone ever. My question is: Would i spend â¬100 to have my phone look like this? I absolutely would. The facts are as follows: It has what is arguably the best chip on the market; the Snapdragon 835. That means it's FAST, has better battery life than most older phones and is just generally as good as it gets. The bezel less design is well done, no black part on the top of your screen that will never go away. The underside of the phone is nice and thin aswell, and has the front facing camera hidden inside it. I can't talk enough about this phone. It's a must have! (unlike the full ceramic version.. ) But that's for another time :). Was this review helpful? Yes No. Stunning display , superior performance , Innovations!. By Amit Joshi | 7 Nov 2017. This phone has got what Apple was known for 'innovation'. First to launch full screen display in world. innovations like Ultrasonic sensors, 4 axis image stabilisation add to superior performance.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 review:. A great Xiaomi phone you can use anywhere. The Good The bezel-less Xiaomi Mix 2 is fast, snappy, and packs LTE support for the whole world.. The Bad The selfie camera is still located at an awkward place below the display, and the phone is only sold in limited countries. The Bottom Line The Mi Mix 2 is the perfect bezel-less phone for Android fans all over the world, but can be hard to get if you don't live in China or India.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Mi Mix 2 brings the goods. Once again, Xiaomi has proven that you don't have to pay your body weight in gold to get a quality, feature-packed phone -- so long as you aren't looking for cutting-edge features.. And for the first time ever, Android fans will be able to use a Xiaomi phone on LTE no matter where they live. The snappy, all-screen Mi Mix 2 includes the right radios to latch onto the fastest networks in the US and other countries across Europe. Before this, Xiaomi phones would ride slower 3G networks outside their home countries, which typically included China, India and Brazil, if they worked at all.. Although the Mi Mix 2 will still only sell in those limited markets and a few more besides, the fact that this high-value handset will work wherever it goes, is a step in the right direction for fans or the Xiaomi-curious that are resourceful enough to get their hands on one.. Xiaomi's Mi Mix 2 is all about the screen. Still, don't think of this as a phone intended for the US or UK, though its dual SIM capabilities mean you'll be able to use it there if you frequently swap carriers or travel internationally.. Any Mi Mix 2s bought in China will come without Google Play Services installed, but those sold through India's retail and online outlets should come with Google apps right out of the box; you'll want to play it safe and double check.. Though the Mi Mix 2 falls at the pricy end of Xiaomi's spectrum, it comes in below handsets such as the Galaxy S8 Plus ( $709.99 at Amazon.com ). The base 6GB RAM, 64GB onboard storage model costs 3,299 yuan, which converts to about $535, £405 or AU$665. There are configurations with more storage that cost more (128GB, 256GB), with the most expensive special edition priced at 4,699 yuan, which converts to $720, £545 or AU$895.. As with the iPhone X ( $1,099.99 at Best Buy ) and Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 , the Mi Mix 2 has a dazzling, edge-to-edge screen. Its 6-inch, 2,080x1,080-pixel resolution display is smaller than last year's 6.4-incher. This gives you a slightly less immersive feel, which I noticed right away, even though it's easier to hold. Its cool ceramic backing hangs on to fingerprints, but it also resists scratches and feels great in the hand.. With enough light, the Mi Mix 2 can take great shots with lots of detail.. The Mi Mix 2 doesn't have the dual cameras we're now seeing on almost all flagship phones, but the lone 12-megapixel shooter at the rear does a good job of taking bright, colorful and detailed images in full lighting all the way down to low light. Front-facing photos were at best decent, and comes with Xiaomi's beauty modes to make you look better. One major downside: You'll have to flip the phone upside down, which is a pain if you're a selfie fanatic.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 2 Interface, Performance, Camera and Multimedia. 3 Call quality, Connectivity, Battery and Conclusion. by Plamen Dimitrov. Android - Android + Xiaomi - Xiaomi +. 2 Interface, Performance, Camera and Multimedia. 3 Call quality, Connectivity, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction In 2016, Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi introduced a smartphone which was among the first to spur the all- screen craze we're observing today. The name of this unusual device was the Xiaomi Mi Mix. The gigantic phablet stood out with its “tri-bezel-less” 6.4-inch screen and attractive ceramic back plate, but unfortunately, it was hard to acquire for anyone living outside of China. Luckily, Xiaomi has recently released a follow-up to the handset which grabbed our attention a little less than 12 months ago. The new Mi Mix 2 comes with many of the traits which made its predecessor a head-turner, but is more compact and features global LTE support. This may sound encouraging if you're looking to import something exotic from overseas, but let's first put the Mi Mix 2 under scrutiny and see if it can compete with its mainstream rivals. Design No longer futuristic, but still a looker Unlike the first model, the design of the Mi Mix 2 doesn't look that futuristic anymore... Of course, this is largely due to every other big company jumping on the all-screen bandwagon, and it doesn't take away from the fact that this handset is a joy to look at. This time around, Xiaomi has gone with a smaller, 6-inch screen, which makes the Mi Mix 2 much more compact than its 6.4-inch predecessor. The display seems to run off the edge on three sides, with a thicker “chin” situated at the bottom. The 5MP front camera is located at the right corner of this lower bezel, which is a big con from a design standpoint. We've covered this at length in our “camera” section, so make sure to check it out for the full scoop. The black plate of this handset is made of ceramic. The premium material is known to be much more scratch-resistant than the glass employed in many other phones, but it's also quite the fingerprint magnet and it isn't immune to cracking. The 12 MP main camera, and dual-LED flash occupy a central spot on the upper half of the phone. The fingerprint scanner is situated below the camera, meaning that there's little chance of users smudging the lens. Also, we're happy to say that the digit reader is quite fast and reliable. Meanwhile, an aluminum frame is sandwiched between the front and back of the device. It plays host to the speaker and type-C USB port that are placed at the bottom, as well as the power key and volume rocker which are situated on the right. You'll find the SIM tray on the left, but sadly, Xiaomi hasn't included a 3.5mm headphone jack. Still, there is an adapter present in the retail box. Display One of the defining features of the Mi Mix 2 is its 6-inch LCD display. With a resolution of 1080 x 2160 pixels, this screen employs an aspect ratio of 18:9. This is not some fancy Quad HD panel, but its pixel density of 402ppi translates to some really nice and sharp-looking graphics. Our overall impressions are that the display is sufficiently bright and quite accurate in terms of color representation. This is further confirmed by our measurements – the color temperature is really close to the ideal 6,500K, while the maximum brightness level stands at 517 nits. On the other hand, the minimum brightness level of 1 nit means that you won't burn your retinas when you use the phone at night.. 5.98 x 2.97 x 0.3 inches. 151.8 x 75.5 x 7.7 mm. 5.97 x 2.97 x 0.29 inches. 151.7 x 75.4 x 7.39 mm. 5.65 x 2.79 x 0.3 inches. 143.6 x 70.9 x 7.7 mm. 6.28 x 2.89 x 0.32 inches. 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 Compare.

Speaking of the image quality the camera optics are very good if not great post processing is to blame here I have seen the exit data and even with the 4 axis OIS shutter speed can't go slower than 1/15th of a sec in low light. I can get better results in manual mode .I am disappointed with the contrast ratio. Worth mentioning this time the cons make sense. Excellent phone with some flaws ..

I'm buying one and all of your cons don't matter to me. I happen to love miui (except the launcher) but that's personal, I don't take selfies and a decent camera is all I want. But you got the biggest pro which is price completely wrong. I've never heard of EUdirect shop and I buy phones regularly but their prices are extortionate. $650 for the 64gb version is over $100 more than most vendors are selling it for. I've ordered the 128gb version for $572 including an extra case and a screen protector. They're selling it for $700 ffs!! Your score should be an 8.5 at least especially when considering the true price. Other than that it was a surprisingly fair review for iPhonearena.. (Posts: 547; Member since: 22 Aug 2015). posted on 19 Oct 2017, 10:07. 1.Miui us one of the best custom os when compared to other OEM. If mix 2 had camera cut on the front panel the it would be futuristic. (Posts: 223; Member since: 29 Feb 2016). posted on 19 Oct 2017, 23:16. I don't believe miui is heavy. If your strictly using phones out of Asia, you'll appreciate miui for keeping pace with the other competitors as far as customization. But if you strictly purchase your phones in North America then you'll find it too heavy compared to the very simplistic UI found in lg, HTC and iPhones..

Xiaomi's Mi Mix 2 is the most luxurious Chinese phone ever made—and it works in the US. Android , bezel-less-phone , china , Gadgets , mi-mix-2 , reviews , smartphone , Tech , Xiaomi , xiaomi-mi-mix-2. By Raymond Wong 2017-09-11 12:00:00 UTC. highlights the best of everything we cover, have experienced first-hand and would recommend to others.. Apple's iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy phones dominate worldwide, but in Asia — and specifically in China — homegrown brands like Huawei , Oppo and Xiaomi are rapidly closing in on them.. Xiaomi, the fifth largest smartphone maker worldwide, in particular is ready to lead , not by repeatedly copying the iPhone, but with industrial design that dazzles. The company started down this path last year with the gorgeous bezel-less Mi Mix , and now it's following it up with the Mi Mix 2, a ceramic sliver from the future that I can't stop fawning over.. SEE ALSO: Xiaomi is finally stepping out of Apple and Samsung's shadows. Xiaomi didn't just launch another nice-looking premium phone with the Mi Mix. It put a stake in the ground and stepped out of Apple and Samsung's shadows.. The Mi Mix was a concept phone that pushed the boundaries of smartphone design and innovation. It used ceramic, came with a huge bezel-less screen, and eschewed a traditional earpiece and unsightly proximity sensors for ultrasound technology to hide these things underneath the screen.. Its designers even convinced Google to change Android's Compatibility Definition Document (CDD) to allow for screens with aspect ratios larger than 16:9 (Mi Mix had a 17:9 ratio) and with rounded corners — two features that are present on many 2017 flagships and wouldn't have been possible if not for the Mi Mix's pioneering.. The Mix Mix collected critical acclaim, but there were just two problems: It wasn't sold in the U.S. You could only drool over it from afar, and even if you managed to import the phone, you'd be constrained to Wi-Fi.. Xiaomi's new Mi Mix 2 still won't be sold in the U.S., but at the very least it now comes works with U.S. 4G LTE networks like AT&T and T-Mobile, making an import actually worth it. The phone's available in select markets on Sept. The 64GB will cost for 3,299 RMB (about $506); 128GB for 3,599 RMB (about $552), and the 256GB variant costs 3,999 RMB (about $614). These prices are unreal for a phone of this caliber, especially when Apple and Samsung are pushing prices into the $1,000 range.. The back is made of scratch-resistant ceramic.. I'm fortunate enough to have held almost every premium phone ever made, but nothing prepared me for the Mi Mix 2. It's in a luxury class of its own.. As much as I love my Jet Black iPhone 7, the glass-and-metal Galaxy Note 8 , and even the titanium and ceramic Essential Phone , the Mi Mix 2 just feels so polished.. The glass display and ceramic back spills flush into the aluminum frame with zero gaps. The Mi Mix 2's materials are as luxurious as a Swiss-made watch, and there really is nothing about it that feels cheap.. The standard Mi Mix 2 comes with an aluminum frame.. Xiaomi's paid careful attention to all the details — all of the lines and ports and speaker holes are perfectly symmetrical — and I appreciated it every moment I held it in my hand. It's truly one of the most elegant phones ever made.. Ceramic, as you may already know, is virtually scratch-proof, but it's not an easy material to work with. Even though ceramic is so difficult to mass produce (yield rates are notoriously low for ceramic-based products), Xiaomi decided it needed to master it to stand out.. I can't stress enough how nice the standard Mi Mix 2 looks and feels.. Donovan Sung, Xiaomi's Director of Product Management and Marketing, explained to me during a briefing how over 200,400 tons of pressure is applied to ceramic in its raw, mushy, pounded down state. Then, the material is baked in an oven at nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 days. After that, you wait up to 12 hours for it all to cool down and shrink to the right volume, see if it meets quality assurance, and then apply CNC techniques to further shape it.. It's an excessive amount of work for a phone, but it's worth it Sung says. "After every 3-4 samples, the blades [used to cut ceramic] get so dulled you have to replace them because it’s just a really, really hard material to work with.". The screen's 5.99-inches, but the whole phone feels so small because of the virtually non-existent bezels.. I've handed the Mi Mix 2 to several colleagues and they all were awestruck by how dense, and solid it felt. There's just something about the slightly cold-to-the-touch ceramic back that just feels better than glass or metal.. Xiaomi also says it applies an anti-fingerprint coating to the ceramic, but honestly they're still quite visible on the mirrored finish. Another downside to ceramic: It's incredibly slippery. I dropped the phone and dented a corner while photographing it. But putting a case over the Mi Mix 2 defeats the point of its design.. The Special Edition, all ceramic model, feels even better.. Still, I can't stress enough how nice the standard Mi Mix 2 looks and feels. Better yet, there's going to be an even better model, the Mi Mix 2 Special Edition with a unibody ceramic case in place of the aluminum. I only had a few minutes to hold the SE model and it's even more luxurious. The all-ceramic version will cost more than the aluminum/ceramic version, but Xiaomi didn't say by how much.. You won't find a "notch" on the Mi Mix 2.. Stunning design aside, the Mi Mix 2 has a bezel-less edge-to-edge screen that sucks you in the second you power it on.. Like the original Mi Mix, the phone's display stretches to the edges on three sides, with a single narrow bezel below the screen. It's a design I've seen before on Sharp's Aquos Crystal , but is all the more magnetic because the corners are rounded and there's no notch that cuts into the display.. Not that the notch is a problem — I quickly stopped noticing it on the Essential phone — but it's just aesthetically more pleasing without one.. You're basically holding just the screen.. The Mi Mix 2's 5.99-inch screen is not OLED, and its resolution is only 2,160 x 1,080 (FHD+), but it never bothered me at all during my first week of testing. It's still plenty bright and colors are vibrant thanks to DCI-P3 wide color gamut. While it's no Note 8 display, it's still better than the Essential Phone, which looks rather dim in comparison.. The display specs might disappoint the hardest-to-please of geeks, but it also means one perk: excellent battery life. I easily got up to 1.5 days of usage on a single charge from its 3,400 mAh battery. And besides, it comes with Quick Charge 3.0 so you can always top it off quickly if you need to.. The fingerprint sensor might be the fastest I've ever used on a phone. The phone still uses ultrasonic proximity sensors in lieu of those ugly black dots found on all other phones, but the earpiece is now a regular one. Sung says Mi Mix users didn't like how the piezoelectric speaker that vibrated sound off the glass display and into your ears dispersed sound in all directions instead of directly forward.. On the bottom "chin" bezel, you'll find a selfie camera (more on that below) tucked in the bottom right corner. And around the back, there's a fingerprint sensor that's one of the fastest I've ever used (it seriously unlocks almost too fast) below the camera.. Sadly, you won't find a headphone jack or a memory card slot for expanding the internal storage. The Mi Mix 2 comes with 6GB of RAM and either 64, 128, or 256GB of storage, and the Mix 2 Special Edition with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. But why no headphone jack or card slot?. Do you see the selfie camera tucked into the lower right corner?. Sung says they dropped the headphone jack because most of its users have already gone wireless. As for why there's no storage expansion, he blames it on poor compatibility, the same reason why OnePlus's phones don't have them. "We feel memory cards are very prone to error and they’re one of the largest source of customer service complaints. So we don’t put memory card slots in our flagship phones.". On the plus side, the Mi Mix does come with dual SIM card slots, if you really need to juggle two numbers and networks.. 3D games are buttery smooth and look incredible.. All of these features mean nothing if the phone's slow and performance stinks. Fortunately, that's not the case on the Mi Mix 2. It's just as fast and smooth as any flagship Android phone. Underneath the hood, it's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chip and 6GB of RAM.. Xiaomi's still crazy about its MIUI (version 9.0 now) interface that sits on top of Android 7.1.1 Nougat. I didn't like it as much years ago when I reviewed the Mi Note and Mi 5 , mainly because it looks like an iOS knockoff, but I can tolerate it now.. The Recent Apps UI looks like an old version of iOS's App Switcher.. MIUI 9 has a minimalist design with nice flat icons, and some of the Xiaomi customizations like Quick Ball, a little floating onscreen button that resembles iOS's onscreen accessibility button gives you shortcuts for things like opening the Recent Apps window and taking screenshots. There are a bunch more very small, tiny things you can turn on within the Settings app, but overall, I like how MIUI doesn't slow anything down.. LTE speed is also solid so you're definitely not getting gimped cellular antennas. I popped in my T-Mobile SIM card and ran the Speedtest app and got 27.92 Mbps download and 28.77 Mbps upload speeds. It's about as fast as my iPhone 7, which 28.23 Mbps downloads and 29.64 Mbps uploads. An Essential Phone managed 27.76 Mbps downloads and 30.91 Mbps uploads. And the Galaxy Note 8 managed 31.19 Mbps download and 23.02 Mbps upload.. The back camera has 12 megapixels with an f/2.0 aperture.. The Mi Mix 2's cameras are good, but not what I'd call great. The 12-megapixel sensor is fast to shoot and autofocus is pretty quick, but I noticed details are a little soft and not as crisp as on an iPhone 7 or Samsung Galaxy S8 or Note 8. Colors are also on the muted side and not as vibrant. HDR processing is also slow and low-light photos have some noticeable image noise.. These things aren't really as noticeable if you're posting to Instagram, but on a computer screen, you can see the difference. If anything, perhaps a software update can fix these things.. Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 camera samples. I'm a little disappointed there aren't dual cameras — this is a flagship phone, after all — but Sung says they would rather have a really great single camera than a dual camera that is half-baked. There are many kinds of dual camera systems, and he thinks anything less than a wide-angle + telephoto, like on the iPhone 7 Plus or Note 8, is inferior.. That said, if you really want dual cameras, then maybe get its Mi 6 phone instead.. As I mentioned earlier, the selfie camera is located in the lower right corner. You can totally take a photo from that angle, but you probably won't. I found my inner palm always blocked the lens (you won't have this problem if you're a leftie) and the angle (looking up into your nose) was always unflattering.. The age guesser within the camera app is a Xiaomi classic. It thinks I'm 15 with a hat on. Instead, the phone actually recommends flipping the phone upside down before taking selfies. It's a minor annoyance, but once you get used to it, the camera's up top and the angle's correct again. (This is one reason why the Essential Phone has a notch for the selfie camera and the company wasn't willing to move it to the bottom bezel.). In Asia, Xiaomi products are hugely popular and getting more so as the company expands into more countries (it now sells phones in 40 countries compared to seven just two years ago).. Its phones continue to sell out almost immediately. The Mi Note sold out in three minutes and the first batch of Mi Mix in 10 seconds. You may not have heard of Xiaomi in the U.S., but you will soon.. While the company still hasn't officially started selling its phones in the U.S. — it's dipped its toes in with fitness trackers, accessories, and the Mi Box , to name a few non-phone devices — it still plans to in the future. Xiaomi's already selling phones in Mexico and some South American countries.. So what's taking so long when its so popular worldwide? Sung says it comes down to resources. phone market is extremely saturated compared to India, Indonesia, and Russia, three countries it's expanded to and is quickly rising to the top in.. 4G LTE bands is a baby step, but an important one if ever wants to play in the U.S.. "When we look at a new market to enter, we look at a couple of things. The first thing we look at is the population of the country so it helps us understand the total addressable market. We also look at the number of internet users and how fast that’s growing. Then, we look at how many of those users already know about Xiaomi and the Xiaomi brand.". At seven, Xiaomi's still pretty young. It doesn't need to enter the U.S. to become a global tech superpower. There are plenty of big lakes to fish at, and that's where it's concentrating its efforts on.. is a market it can't ignore forever. at some point in the future. We really want to make a big splash," Sung says.. Xiaomi's been towing this line for years, but it's finally making the right moves. The Mi Mix 2 may not be sold through the company's online store in the U.S., but if you really want it, it won't be hard to find find it online some other way. 4G LTE bands is a baby step, but an important one if ever wants to play in the U.S.. I've reviewed several of Xiaomi's previous phones, but I could never whole-heartedly recommend them because you couldn't use them in the U.S., but now I can with the Mi Mix 2. It's just so beautiful and unlike any other phone.. Ceramic back feels incredible • Flagship specs and performance • Finally supports U.S. 4G LTE networks • Sharp bezel-less display • Great battery life. No water resistance • No headphone jack • No dual cameras • Camera takes soft photos. Xiaomi's Mi Mix 2 is a ceramic sliver from the future, and best of all, finally works in the U.S. even if it's not sold here..

While Apple may be making headlines this year with the slim bezel of the iPhone X , it’s by no means the first company to enter this arena.. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 famously asked consumers to ‘unbox’ their handset, but prior to that, Chinese company Xiaomi had established the full-screen vision with 2016’s Mi Mix.. That device was more a concept phone, but Xiaomi is back with a sequel handset that’s set to spearhead its long-overdue expansion into Europe. The Mi Mix 2 boasts a 5.99-inch screen surrounded by a metal chassis and a ceramic back panel. Powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chipset and packing 6GB of RAM in its base configuration, this is unquestionably a top-tier device – yet it can be purchased from online re-sellers such as Gearbest for around £440.. The original Mi Mix was something of a beast, even though its edge-to-edge display reduced its bezels (on three sides, at least) to practically none. Xiaomi has modified the design of the Mi Mix 2 slightly in order to make it more manageable in the hand – the display has dropped from 6.4-inches to 5.99-inches.. We’re still firmly in phablet territory here, but compared to other 6-inch handsets the Mi Mix 2 isn’t as big as you’d expect. That gorgeous LCD screen fills almost the entire front of the phone; the chin at the bottom remains, but is smaller than it was on the original Mi Mix.. The rounded edges of the Mi Mix 2 are very ‘iPhone’. The rear is of a premium-feel ceramic material, which – while something of a fingerprint magnet – makes the phone look stunning. It’s also scratch-resistant, but don’t expect it to remain in one piece if you happen to drop the device; Xiaomi bundles in a protective case with the phone for good reason.. The super-fast fingerprint scanner is positioned on the rear of the handset, and above it you’ll find the 12-megapixel camera, which is surrounded by a rather fetching gold-plated ring.. The bottom edge of the device is home to the USB Type-C port and one of two speakers (the other is in the earpiece), and the volume and power buttons reside on the right-hand edge. The SIM card tray – which accepts two nano-SIMs at once – is on the opposite edge.. The use of metal and ceramic gives the Mi Mix 2 some serious weight, but it’s balanced nicely and feels reassuringly robust. If someone told you this was Samsung or Apple’s latest handset you wouldn’t question it for a second; it’s utterly gorgeous.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. Unfortunately, Xiaomi hasn’t been able to include any kind of water- or dust-resistance. In addition, it’s also lacking a 3.5mm headphone socket, although the manufacturer has been kind enough to include an adapter in the box.. As mentioned, the 5.99-inch IPS LCD screen dominates the front of the Mi Mix 2, and is covered by super-tough Gorilla Glass 4 for protection.. Its 1080 x 2160 resolution offers a pixel density of 403ppi, which results in pin-sharp image quality. The panel is bright, colourful and striking, with superb viewing angles and good legibility in direct sunlight. The tall and slim 18:9 aspect ratio means the phone isn’t too wide to hold in one hand, either.. With Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chipset calling the shots, it goes without saying that the Mi Mix 2 is blessed with lightning-fast performance. 6GB of RAM is included in the base model; a more expensive variant has a whopping 8GB.. The end result is a phone that can handle pretty much any task you throw at it. Switching between apps is smooth and stutter-free, and intense 3D games run beautifully. This really is a flagship phone experience in terms of performance, with no corners cut whatsoever.. It might not be obvious the moment you turn it on, but the Mi Mix 2 is armed with stereo speakers, one on the bottom edge and the other in the earpiece – a similar approach to that taken by Apple with its phones.. The key difference here is that the quality of these speakers is noticeably weaker; bass is non-existent and the earpiece speaker is rather feeble. As a result, it often sounds like there’s only one speaker working, which is a shame.. Still, at least Xiaomi opted to include a real earpiece this time around – the original Mi Mix used “cantilever piezoelectric ceramic acoustic technology” to essentially vibrate the phone’s frame to create sound. As impressive as this technical feat was, it resulted in a very low call volume. This isn’t an issue with the Mi Mix 2, thanks to its more traditional earpiece.. Like many other Android handset makers, Xiaomi installs its own user interface skin over the top of Google’s core mobile OS. MIUI has been around for quite some time now, and is one of the more extreme UI skins. In the past it’s been branded ‘iOS on Android’, thanks to the fact that it borrows many thematic elements from Apple’s software.. Over the past few updates this has changed, but there are still a few similarities. The most obvious is the lack of an app drawer. On the whole, though, MIUI offers some neat innovations of its own, alongside the typical deep customisation for which Android is famed.. You can download homescreen and app icon themes, create a ‘second space’ for the installation of more than one copy of the same app, and even randomise your lockscreen wallpaper, pulling images from Xiaomi’s servers to ensure you have a different look for each day.. The Mi Mix 2 we reviewed ships with MIUI 8.5, which sits on top of Android 7.1.1. MIUI 9 has just been launched and is slowly but surely being pushed to Xiaomi’s 2017 handsets as we speak. It’s still based on Android Nougat, but comes with a raft of improvements, including the ability to run two apps on-screen at once – just like Samsung’s phones.. Xiaomi is pretty aggressive when it comes to OTA updates and works with its community to eliminate bugs and factor in requested features. This makes MIUI a pretty exciting prospect. However, if you find you don’t like Xiaomi’s vision for Android, you can always install the Google Now Launcher to make it at least look like a stock Google experience.. Note that the unit we were sent in for review ships with the Chinese version of MIUI. While this does have an English language option, it comes preloaded with apps intended for the Chinese market.. It also refuses to play nice with some location-based services, which expect you to be in the Far East. It lacks official Google app support, and while it’s perfectly possible to install all of the relevant components to get Google’s ecosphere running, the phone still tries to push you back to Xiaomi’s own digital storefront whenever it can.. With a bit of effort it’s possible to install the global version of MIUI – which eliminates almost all of these annoyances – and that’s something we recommend you do at the earliest possibly opportunity. A word of warning, however: it’s anything but a straightforward procedure and requires you to unlock the phone’s bootloader and flash new firmware updates using PC-based software.. The Mi Mix 2’s 12-megapixel Sony IMX368 sensor comes with phase-detection autofocus and 4-axis optical image stabilisation. As such, when conditions are right, it’s capable of taking some really impressive images.. Unfortunately, low-light shooting is a hit-and-miss affair, with the sensor struggling to allow in enough light for a decent shot – even when aided by the handset’s custom low-light shooting mode. Admittedly, the speedy dual-tone flash doesn’t help in these situations either, since it tends to wash out the photo.. Compared to the images you can take on the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8, the Mi Mix 2’s photos feature more aggressive compression, which results in a dramatic loss of detail when you zoom in close.. It’s also puzzling as to why Xiaomi decided against packing a dual-camera setup on this phone, despite using two cameras on its Mi6 handset – a second, wide-angle sensor would have been welcome. 4K video recording is possible at 30 frames a second, but audio recording is somewhat poor.. With that massive screen filling the display on the front, Xiaomi has had to get creative when it comes to the placement of the front-facing selfie camera. The camera is located in the bottom-right of the phone’s front, which means you have to turn the handset around to take a traditional selfie shot. Thankfully, the UI prompts you to do this whenever you switch to the front sensor. It’s a mild annoyance, but not one that will keep anyone awake at night.. The battery inside the Mi Mix 2 is rated at 3400mAh, which is a drop from the gigantic 4400mAh power cell contained inside its predecessor. Shrinking the phone down left Xiaomi little choice, and the good news is that even with the reduction in capacity the Mi Mix 2 has some serious staying power.. I was able to comfortably get an entire day of fairly heavy usage on a single charge. If I was a little more modest with my demands, it managed to get through half of the following day, too. Since it sports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0, the phone can go from practically nothing to 85% battery in just over an hour. The base model of the Mi Mix 2 has 64GB of storage, but 128GB and 256GB editions are also available. Choosing the right storage amount is important – sadly, the Mi Mix 2 doesn’t support microSD cards, which is unusual for a Chinese device.. From a design perspective, the Mi Mix 2 is a stunning smartphone. Xiaomi has been producing jaw-dropping devices for the past few years now, but this could possibly be the company’s most attractive offering yet. It looks and feels great, with the ceramic back and the gold-plated camera giving it a real touch of class.. On the downside, the lack of water and dust protection is disappointing – especially since pretty much every flagship phone has it now – and the camera performance is rather underwhelming in low light.. I’d also say that unless you’re willing to tinker with the phone’s software to install the global version of MIUI, you’ll have to put up with a China-focused user experience – which is often a little puzzling and disorientating.. These niggles aside, the Mi Mix 2 offers absolutely incredible value for money at under £450 – less than half the price of the £1000 iPhone X.. In practically every regard the Mi Mix 2 is a flagship handset that can stand proud with the best the smartphone world has to offer.. Thanks to Gearbest for supplying the unit used in this review..

Xiaomi Mi Mix 2: Everything you need to know. What iPhone? The beautiful bezel-less Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is here. The Xiaomi Mi Mix. was a taste of what was to come in smartphone design when it released last fall — a large, gorgeous display with next to no bezels. A year later, almost every major manufacturer has followed Xiaomi’s lead in cutting out unused surface area. All the while, the company has been quietly preparing the Mi Mix 2 , a successor to its iconic handset. Xiaomi announced the Mi Mix 2 alongside the Mi Note 3, and a new Mi Notebook Pro laptop, at an event in Beijing on September 11.. It’s the Mi Mix 2’s screen that will attract all the initial attention. It measures 5.99 inches, and has an 18:9 aspect ratio, which is shared by the LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8. This makes the body quite tall, and is different from the first Mi Mix’s 17:9 aspect ratio and 6.4-inch screen. The chin below the screen has been reduced in size by 12 percent, and from the images sent out by Xiaomi, the phone’s aluminum frame is curvier and thinner than the original Mi Mix. All this should mean the phone is easier to hold.. Due to the screen taking up the whole of the front panel, the selfie camera is set in the chin, so you’ll have to rotate the phone round to take images naturally with the front camera. On the back is a single Sony camera lens with 12 megapixels and 1.25nm pixel size, which is the same as the main camera found on the Xiaomi Mi 6. It also features 4-axis optical image stabilization and a flash unit.. Xiaomi has worked on improving the sound produced by the Mi Mix 2. It still uses an ultrasonic proximity sensor and a piezoelectric ceramic audio system, meaning you hear calls when placing your ear against the screen. Now it also has a small speaker hole at the very top of the screen, which is connected to a sound guide leading to a membrane speaker inside the device, producing better sound than before.. Inside the Mi Mix 2 is a Snapdragon 835 processor and 6GB of RAM, a choice of either 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of storage space, plus global LTE support across 43 different bands. The great news is, the LTE bands for AT&T and T-Mobile are included, so if you decide to import a Mi Mix 2, you no longer have to compromise with a lower data speed connection. The Mi Mix 2 won’t be officially sold in the United States, and has currently only been announced for China, where it costs the local equivalent of $500 for the 64GB version, $550 for the 128GB model, and $615 for the 256GB model.. If you’re feeling very flush, a special edition all-ceramic Mi Mix 2 will also be sold. It comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB storage, and will cost around $720 locally. It forgets the aluminum chassis from the regular Mi Mix 2, and is instead made from a single piece of ceramic in a process that takes seven days to complete. It comes in a black color, or a beautiful white model, which we desperately want to own.. Xiaomi hasn’t provided a release date for the Mi Mix 2 yet, but we’ll keep you updated here..

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. Ask any filmmaker who's been tasked to make a sequel to a surprise box office hit, and they'll likely tell you how tough it is to recapture the magic and live up to expectations. Beijing-based Xiaomi was in a similar predicament most of this year as it was working towards the Mi Mix 2, officially unveiled a few hours ago.. The first Mi Mix was, after all, a surprise hit in every sense of the word.. When then-company vice president Hugo Barra, without prior announcement, whipped out. at a Beijing launch event last October (which was advertised as an event for another device,. of the phone drew audible grasps from the crowd. The reaction across the world, from snarky tech bloggers to. oldschool print journos (a much tougher crowd to please) were similar. Headlines were as sensational as they were enthusiastic: "Xiaomi blows minds," wrote. "The concept phone of your wildest dreams," declared The Verge. Even sites that didn't usually cover Android phones, like MacRumors and. HighSnobiety , had something to say.. So yes, tough act to follow.. I've been using Xiaomi's Mi Mix sequel for almost five days now, and I can indeed say its "wow factor" doesn't compare to the first device. This is due to no fault of Xiaomi, which improved on the first Mi Mix on every front: it's more powerful, faster, and feels much better in the hand than the first device. But the Mi Mix 2 didn't blow me away like the first phone did, because whereas the Mi Mix 1 stood alone at the time of release, the Mi Mix 2 is coming into a market full of bezel-less phones, from companies ranging from global juggernauts like Apple to obscure Shenzhen companies like Vkworld. The Mi Mix 1 made every other phone look outdated at the time of release; the 2. This is not to say the Mi Mix 2 doesn't look good. It's an exceptionally well-crafted piece of hardware that feels different from most of the glass or metal handsets on the market because of its choice of material.. "We are still the only smartphone manufacturer dedicated to using ceramic," said Donavan Sung, Xiaomi's director of product management. Much like the Mi Mix 1, the Mi Mix 2's back is entirely crafted out of ceramic. first gen device, however, Xiaomi developed a unibody ceramic casing that wraps all the way around the device. After implementing into the display panel, the device feels like one smooth piece of ceramic. Sung said this unibody casing takes seven days. to produce from start to finish.. This unibody casing is, however, limited to the "special edition" of the Mi Mix 2 (which also packs additional RAM). The standard version of the Mi Mix 2, which I tested, still has a flat ceramic back plate, but it's. implemented into an aluminum alloy frame. As a result there is a line of visible seam around the edges of the. back where the ceramic meets aluminum. the seam is hardly visible unless you inspect closely (you can get a better look in my video review, which. at the end of this article).. The gold trim -- which Xiaomi says is 18-karat -- around the camera lens that was only available in the premium edition of the first device makes a return and is now available on all Mi Mix 2 editions. It's a nice touch that should appeal to mainland consumers especially.. The camera trim is made of 18-karat gold, according to Xiaomi.. The back of the Mi Mix 2 is very shiny and reflective.. Overall, the Mi Mix 2 keeps that "piece of jewelry" vibe of the first device, perhaps more so, because the 2 is curvier and more petite than the boxy Mi Mix 1. This is a godsend, because as much as I liked the first phone, its 205g weight and boxy, thick dimensions made the phone uncomfortable to use after long periods. The Mi Mix 2 is 20g lighter, and significantly less wide across from left to right. Xiaomi didn't accomplish this with some miraculous feat of engineering though -- it merely made the screen size smaller.. The Mi Mix 2 sports a 5.99-inch (Xiaomi's official measurement ... from here on out I'll just call it 6-inch) LCD panel instead of the 6.4-inch monster of the first. The resolution of this new 6-inch panel is 2160 X 1080, which is a bit more than the standard 1080p because. has that same longer/wider 18:9 aspect ratio first introduced in the LG G6 (Samsung's Galaxy S8 has a similar 18.5:9 ratio).. going to be the new industry standard for mobile screens -- like I've written before, LG doesn't get enough credit for being the pioneer of several industry trends --. but Xiaomi's Sung is keen to point out that the first Mi Mix, which hadd a 17:9 aspect ratio, actually helped push things in that direction.. "When we developed the first Mi Mix, we went back and forth with Google a bunch of times because at the time, Google's CDD [ Compatibility Definition Document ] stated that all Android devices must use a 16:9 aspect ratio," Sung said. our case for a different aspect ratio,. A few weeks after the Mi Mix was released and became the talk of the mobile industry, Sung said, Google updated its CDD to allow for. varying screen aspect ratios, which he believes helped pave the way for LG and Samsung to break from the norm.. The Samsung Galaxy S8+ (left), LG V30 (middle), and Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 (right), all rocking the new 18(ish):9 aspect ratio.. Whatever aspect ratio it is, the Mi Mix 2's panel is very good. Colors are accurate and punchy, and unless you have superhuman eyesight you won't see the difference between it and a higher resolution Quad HD display found on other phones. I do wish Xiaomi had gone with an OLED panel (it did with the Mi Note 2) because OLED panels offer deeper blacks.. Internally, the handset runs Android 7.1.1 with Xiaomi's latest software, MIUI 9 on top. In what should be great news to most readers, the MIUI version here is the global ROM, meaning it was built to be compatible with Google apps (MIUI's China-specific ROMs don't have Google Play services and can be quite buggy if forced to run Google apps). Sung said Xiaomi built the Mi Mix 2 with a "global release" in mind, and that's why its modem has 43 frequency bands, including support for all major U.S. Powering things is a Snapdragon 835 processor with 6GB of RAM on the standard edition or 8GB on the special edition.. The device during my five days of use ran smoothly. I particularly tested Google apps (which crashes often on my Mi Mix 1 because it has a China ROM) and thankfully, they all worked fine on the Mi Mix 2..

Pros: high-quality finish, the feeling of a top quality device, the display, the quick charge Cons: none. Is this helpful? Yes ( 0 ) No ( 0 ). Spec sheet speaks for itself, picture does not do it justice. Pros: Took a little over 2 weeks to arrive to London, UK if anyone is wondering. Phone in itself is beautiful, spec sheet speaks for itself, the case that comes with it has design in mind so would strongly advise purchasing a case to go with it for some added protection. Gearbest were great in that they included a UK adapter free of charge as the plug supplied is designed for Asia. MIUI 8 comes preloaded but all applications are uninstallable nothing like the phones you get in the UK where you\'re stuck with bloatware unless you flash therefore voiding warranty. Google play is not on the phone originally but is easy enough to find and install - then it\'s just a matter of linking your account up and reinstalling apps and getting your contacts back etc. Cons: The phone allows you to choose the English language but many of the apps and interface is in Chinese as long as you are patient and know how to navigate around most android phones, you won\'t have a problem setting this up. It comes loaded with MIUI 8 as far as I\'m aware there is a 9 out but phone hasn\'t prompted an update just yet... Google play is not on the phone originally - but is easy enough to find and install (this is only a con because I\'m used to it being on there, I understand that if I was in Asia this is standard) Ease of use rating loses a star because of the Chinese language still very much being present which I know will frustrate some people Usefulness Rating loses a star because apps on the phone that are in Chinese that have no way to change the language they\'re displayed in, become redundant..

Its standout feature is its design - a highly scratch-resistant ceramic body houses a 6-inch displa that nearly fills the entire front side. Specs like the Snapdragon 835 SoC and the plentiful memory cement this phone in the high-end category. A standard 12MP camera is at the back, along with a fingerprint scanner, while a selfie shooter is positioned at an odd position - below the display..

Kunal Dua , 07 November 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 has a stunning design and great build quality. Performance and battery life are great as well. Sadly, the cameras are not up to the mark. Mi Mix 2 design and display Mi Mix 2 specifications, performance, and battery life Mi Mix 2 software and camera. Edge-to-edge displays might be the talk of the town right now thanks to the iPhone X , but as anyone with even a passing interest in the smartphone industry would know, Apple’s newest flagship is not the first smartphone to embrace this design. That feather belongs in the cap of Xiaomi , which released the Mi Mix last year when the iPhone X when was nothing but a rumour you read about on a site like this one.. Xiaomi released the Mi Mix with an all-ceramic body and striking display as a ‘concept’ smartphone, much like the concept cars that manufacturers showcase in the auto world. While most concept cars never really hit the market, Xiaomi’s design has inspired a whole host of ‘bezel-less’ smartphones since then. These have included the Samsung Galaxy S8 , Galaxy S8+ , Galaxy Note 8 , and LG G6 , among others, with some more true to their bezel-less nature than the rest. So how does Xiaomi’s second take on the trend it kickstarted perform in the real world? Let’s find out in our review of the Mi Mix 2 .. A lot of smartphones claim to be ‘all screen’ but the Mi Mix 2 is arguably the one that has come closest to making this a reality. Just like its predecessor, the Mi Mix 2 has done away with the ‘forehead’ almost entirely, which means the selfie camera had to be moved to below the display. However, unlike the original Mi Mix - which used piezoelectric acoustic ceramic earpiece to deliver sound “straight to the ear” - Xiaomi has managed to find space for a tiny, covential speaker just above the display. The proximity sensor, however, is still ultrasonic, and not infrared, as seen on most smartphones. The chin - the part below the display - on the Mi Mix 2 is noticeably smaller than that of the Mi Mix .. The rear camera is surrounded by a 18-karat gold-plated decorative rim, giving the phone a distinctive look from the back as well. Below that you will find the fingerprint scanner, and the words ‘Mi Mix Designed by Xiaomi’, just in case you had any doubts about the smartphone you were using. A dual-tone flash sits to the right of the camera module.. The Mi Mix 2 does away with the 3.5mm headphone jack, but you get a USB Type-C port at the bottom for charging, data transfers, and audio. A Type-C-to-3.5mm adapter is bundled with the phone. In the retail box, you also get a back cover for the Mi Mix 2, a 9V/2A charger that supports Quick Charge 3.0, a USB Type-C cable, a SIM eject tool, and some documentation. Like other Xiaomi phones, there are no earphones. Interestingly, the Type-C-to-3.5mm adapter bundled with the Mi Mix 2 did not work with other smartphones including the Nexus 6P , Nokia 8 , and HTC U11. On either side of the Type-C port you have grilles, with the left one housing the mic while the right one has the speaker.. The Mi Mix 2 has an aerospace-grade aluminium alloy frame and a ceramic backplate that’s curved on all four sides. This gives the smartphone a really nice, premium feel, though the back is a fingerprint magnet, so you’d be well advised to keep something to wipe it with handy. In India, the phone is available only in black.. Instead of the 6.4-inch 17:9 display on the Mi Mix display, Xiaomi has switched to a 5.99-inch 18:9 screen on the Mi Mix 2, which makes the smartphone a lot easier to handle. The 1080x2160-pixel display has a 1500:1 contrast ratio and support for the DCI-P3 colour gamut as well as features like Sunlight Display and Reading Mode seen on other Xiaomi smartphones.. The screen itself offers vibrant colours with good contrast and brightness, even outdoors. Watching videos and reading text-heavy documents or webpages is especially enjoyable on edge-to-edge displays like the one on the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2. By default, the smartphone displays on-screen buttons at the bottom of the display, but you can choose to hide them - and have them show only when you swipe up - for a more immersive experience.. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is powered by the Snapdragon 835 SoC, which has been seen in most Android flagships of 2017, including the OnePlus 5 - which can be considered the Mi Mix 2’s closest competitor, at least until the OnePlus 5T comes out. This phone also packs 6GB of RAM and 128GB of non-expandable internal storage, out of which nearly 118GB is available for end use. The Mi Mix 2 has dual Nano-SIM slots, though 4G can be active on only one SIM at any given time.. The smartphone supports VoLTE , and Xiaomi claims support for six network modes and 43 bands, which, the company says, is the most of any smartphone. You also get support for NFC, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac including MU-MIMO, and Bluetooth 5.0, which means the Mi Mix 2 ticks all the boxes when it comes to connectivity options.. As you would expect, the Mi Mix 2 proved to be a reliable workhorse for all day-to-day tasks, and we didn’t experience any performance-related issues at any point in time. Games such as Asphalt 8 and Breakneck ran flawlessly, and the phone did not get warm even after extended gaming sessions. The benchmark scores were pretty similar to those of other Snapdragon 835-powered smartphones.. Initially, we thought accidental touch inputs would be a big problem given the edge-to-edge nature of the display, but with everyday use, this fear turned out to be unfounded. The apps we tried scaled correctly to the 18:9 display on the Mi Mix 2 without any issues. While watching 16:9 videos in landscape mode you will notice tiny black bands to the left and right. You can choose to go ‘full screen’ at the cost of cropping a bit of content from the top and bottom, a tradeoff you end up making while watching content in a non-native aspect ratio on any screen.. As we mentioned before, the Mi Mix 2 has its fingerprint sensor at the back, just below the rear camera module. We found it easy to reach every single time, though the experiences of those with smaller hands may vary. The scanner worked reliably every single time we reached to unlock the phone, though its placement means you cannot do so when it’s lying on its back without lifting it, unless you enter the passcode.. Call quality was decent, and the tiny earpiece performed satisfactorily during phone calls, addressing a complaint many had with the original Mi Mix. The mono speaker gets sufficiently loud but cannot, of course, match the audio fidelity of a stereo setup.. The Mi Mix 2 has a 3400mAh battery, which performed great in our HD video loop test, lasting just a shade under 13 hours of continuous playback. Our real-world experience was equally good, with the smartphone easily lasting over 1.5 days of medium to heavy usage. With light use, the Mi Mix 2 could take you from the start of one day to the end of the next. Unfortunately, our review until did not come with a charger, so we couldn’t test the Quick Charge functionality with the bundled power adapter.. The Mi Mix 2 runs MIUI 8.5 out of the box, which is built upon Android 7.1.1. MIUI, of course, is Xiaomi’s own take on Android, one that customises nearly every aspect of the operating system. Most OEMs are moving towards stock Android - or at least reducing bloat in one form or other from their respective skins - but despite its Android One experiment with the Mi A1, Xiaomi is sticking to its guns with the Mi Mix 2 for now. This and other smartphones are also slated to receive an update to MIUI 9, which adds a bunch of new features, sometime later this month.. Software features that the Mi Mix 2 shares with other Xiaomi smartphones include Dual Apps, i.e. the ability to run multiple instances of apps like Facebook and WhatsApp on the same phone; Second Space, which is like having a second user/ profile on your phone with its own set of core apps; and Quick Ball, which lets you place a virtual ball anywhere on the screen and use it to trigger various apps/ actions. You also get a customisable one-handed mode and support for gestures, such as one that lets you swipe down with three fingers to take a screenshot. We encourage you to read our reviews of other Xiaomi phones to find out more about MIUI.. The camera app on the Mi Mix 2 is the same as what you get on other Xiaomi phones running MIUI, with options for Panorama, Manual, Beautify, and Square modes. You can also time your shots, voice trigger them using the Audio mode, or use the Group-Selfie mode to have selfies captured automatically when a face is detected. The Straighten mode lets you align your shots perfectly, while the Tilt-Shift mode will let you blur parts of the shot. Finally, the Hand-Held Twilight aka HHT mode is designed to improve low-light photography by stitching together multiple shots - we noticed at times that this kicks in automatically during low light conditions.. The Mi Mix 2 has a 12-megapixel rear camera with 4-axis optical image stabilisation and the ability to record 4K video at 30fps. You also get a slow-motion mode that can record at 120 frames per second, but is limited to 720p resolution. The front camera has a 5-megapixel sensor but no flash, not even the kind where the display lights up to brighten up the shot.. Images shot using the rear camera outdoors looked alright on the phone, but upon closer examination on a PC, we found that they appeared over-exposed and lacked the amount of detail that you’d expect from a phone in this price range. At times, objects weren’t properly in focus. Videos recorded with the Mi Mix 2 were similarly disappointing in terms of visual detail, though the audio quality was decent.. Images shot in low light exhibited similar characteristics and we even noticed artifacts when there was more than one source of light. The flash on the Mi Mix 2 can be rather overbearing. Even selfies taken outdoors appeared overexposed and ‘whiter’ than expected - we’re not sure if this is a result of the ‘beautification’ features kicking in.. Tap to see full-sized Mi Mix 2 camera samples. Talking about selfies, we mentioned earlier that the front camera is now placed at the bottom of the phone, and this means you will need to make a few adjustments to your habits. First, of course, you will need to hold the phone a little higher than usual while taking pictures in portrait mode, but, more importantly, you might find that part of your hand keeps blocking the camera.. This is why the first time you try to use the front camera, Xiaomi recommends that you hold the Mi Mix 2 in landscape mode. Even if you hold the phone from its bottom edge, you will find the problem doesn’t go away entirely, and you might need to hold it from the top edge, which isn’t convenient. Thankfully, either of the volume buttons or the fingerprint scanner can be tapped to trigger a capture, though that mitigates the problem only a little bit.. Verdict Xiaomi has tasted one success after another over the past 12-18 months, and the company looks set to dethrone Samsung as the number one player by volume in India’s smartphone market. This has largely been possible because of its budget Redmi offerings, but recently, we’ve seen the company looking to experiment with other price bands and product segments with the likes of the Xiaomi Mi A1 and the recently launched Redmi Y1 series .. The Mi Mix 2 is arguably the most crucial part of this new strategy, as it is the first premium smartphone that the company has launched in India ever since Mi 5’s lukewarm reception. In the meanwhile, the likes of the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T - and more recently the OnePlus 5 and Honor 8 Pro - have done well for themselves in the “budget flagships” category, and the Mi Mix 2 India launch is an attempt to grab a slice of that pie.. To Xiaomi’s credit, the Mi Mix 2 gets a lot right - the phone has a head-turning design, a great display, fantastic battery life, and excellent performance. Xiaomi also has a decent track record of eventually delivering software updates, though they don’t quite follow Google’s update cycle. Our only real gripe is with the cameras - the placement of the front camera is awkward, and we would have been willing to forgive that if its performance was great, but that sadly isn’t the case here.. Much like the OnePlus 5, the Mi Mix 2 falls short in the camera department, though it has none of the display issues of the former, and its design is anything but boring. If your primary use case will be sharing pictures on Facebook and Twitter, the Mi Mix 2 might well serve your purpose, though if you are looking for a better camera in a more traditional package, you should give the Honor 8 Pro a look. Or you could wait and see what the OnePlus 5T has to offer.. For the latest smartphone launches by Samsung, Nokia, Sony, Asus, and other MWC 2018 announcements, visit our MWC hub ..

Apart from that oddly placed front camera, the Mi Mix 2 has looks, power and the user experience that no other phone at this price can offer.. Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 price and release date Rs 35,999 for 6GB and 128GB variant On sale October 17 in India via Mi.com and Flipkart Design Ceramic back, metal on the edges and Gorilla Glass 4 on front Stunning finish on the ceramic back is scratchproof Back is fragile and attracts fingerprints. Display 5.99-inch FHD display Edge to edge FHD 18:9 Aspect ratio. We have seen some fascinating smartphone innovations in the past one year, but if there's one evolution that became a head-turner, it would be the original Mi Mix. When the Mi Mix was launched, it was said to be a 'concept' from Xiaomi which started off the bezelless trend across OEMs. It was the moment when the name Xiaomi crossed many untouched borders, and the industry perceived a capable name rising from China.. Xiaomi with Mi Mix made it clear that the company has the potential to stand up against big names. Looking at the huge demand from Xiaomi fans, the company reworked on the original Mix and returned with the new Mi Mix 2, which is more refined, logical and a favourable implementation of the bezelless concept.. Since the Mi Mix, we have seen a handful of smartphones thinning down the bezels and maximising the screen to body ratio. From Samsung Galaxy S8 , LG G6 , Essential phone to the new iPhone X , all phones have arrived with their best possible implementation of minimal bezel design. Since there are so many existing options in the market, it's now a little tricky for the Mi Mix 2 to make a mark like its predecessor without having the perk of being one of a kind smartphone.. The Mi Mix 2 is Xiaomi's chance to put itself firmly back on the flagship smartphone segment in India after the Mi 5 , but has it succeeded? Lets find out.. As expected, this Xiaomi phone unlike its siblings sits at a higher price range. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is priced at Rs 35,999, which will put it face to face against the likes of OnePlus 5 and the recently launched Nokia 8 in terms of cost.. The Mi Mix 2 will be available at special preview sale for Mi Fans on October 17 at 12 Noon on Mi.com and Flipkart.. Following this, the phone will go on sale across Mi.com, Flipkart , Mi Home stores and on all offline partners during the first week of November at a 0 percent interest EMI scheme.. Xiaomi's latest is the second flagship smartphone after Mi 6 that the company has launched this year, hence they are betting big on this. When it comes to design the Mix 2 leaves nothing left to be desired if you have an eye for beauty. Designed by Philippe Starck, the Mix 2 is one fine piece of art that looks and feels premium right from the moment you hold it for the first time.. Although the design is strikingly similar to the original Mi Mix, having a 5.99-inch display in place of huge 6.4-inch makes the Mix 2 shorter by 7mm, narrower by 6.4mm and at 7.7mm it is 0.2 mm thinner. Also, it weighs 185g, which is around 24g lighter than the original Mix without compromising the sturdy feel of the device.. The new Mix 2 has a ceramic and aluminum body instead of a stainless steel like the original Mix. Still, there's both pros and cons of having a ceramic back, as it looks good and can't be scratched easily but it is very fragile and catches fingerprints. While the back is made up of shiny ceramic, the sides this time are made up of aluminum to give it a better grip and render sturdiness. On the front it has Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for protection.. If you are buying this phone for looks, it's highly possible that you wont prefer having a cover over the back but Xiaomi bundles a back cover that looks sleek and has a super-snug fit.. As already mentioned, the phone leaves no space for bezels except for the chin, where it has the front camera baked in the right corner. Xiaomi did not go the Apple or Essential way by putting the notch to place the front camera on top of the display. Xiaomi didn't just got rid of bezels but this time it does not come with a 3.5mm audio jack. But thankfully you'll get a USB Type-C to 3.5mm connector inside the box. On top of the display, you'll see another fine piece of designing in the earpiece which peeps out of a tiny cut-out in the middle of the glass.. The beauty exists in small details like the gold ring around the camera and the discreetly placed antennae bands on the top and bottom. The SIM slot is on the left and whereas the right edge has the volume rocker and power/lock key. Fingerprint sensor is placed at an optimal position companied by company’s iconic branding that says ‘MIX designed by Xiaomi’ in gold color.. The phone is slippery but that shiny look and in-hand feel is the dominant appeal of the design. It has subtle curves on the sides that dismisses the edgy feel on the phone. It feels like a solid glass slab that weighs even at both top and bottom.. The defining feature of the Mi Mix 2 is its front that's covered mostly by a huge display. In spite of having a QHD display, Xiaomi sticks with a 5.99-inch full HD+ display with 1080 x 2160p resolution maybe to balance out the battery consumption. Following on from the current smartphone trend, the Mix 2 also brings along the 18:9 aspect ratio with rounder corners.. If you have complains about not having a QHD panel then I must assure you that the display looks quite good. The IPS display slightly softens the punch to retain it’s eye-pleasing viewing experience. The screen brightness is somewhat like LG displays that offers the perfect balance of brightness and colors. If you compare it with AMOLED display phones like S8 or OnePlus, it is a little less saturated. The colour profile is further changeable in the settings menu with a dedicated reading mode included for minimise blue light emission to enhance reading.. Color reproduction is on point, if you are one of them who like vivid colors then you can always tweak it from the settings but don’t expect it to get anywhere near Galaxy S8’s Super AMOLED. Using it in outdoors is not a problem as it adjusts the brightness to a readable limit in almost no time.. Still if you are on a hunt for the best display, then you might like the Galaxy S8 more than this one. But on a phone with such immersive front panel, the display does not disappoint either. It works great for reading, watching video content or even for using GPS. During my experience, there was a moment when I was just exceptionally impressed while using maps, browsing websites, and obviously multimedia experience is stunning too. Also, the viewing angles of the display are really impressive even in well lit conditions.. Next Page What’s it like to use?.

The lowest price of Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is at Flipkart. Mi Mix 2 is not available in other online stores.. Xiaomi Mi Mix 2: Pros & Cons. Good Stuff Looks beautiful with bezel-less design Fast and fluid performance Feature-packed MIUI 9 Excellent battery backup Bad Stuff Camera performance isn't as good as the competitors Display should have been equipped with AMOLED technology. Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 Review: Almost There. Xiaomi has launched the Mi Mix 2 smartphone in India, which has a bezel-less design. The Mi Mix 2 competes directly with the OnePlus 5T, which also has a bezel-less design. On the paper, the Xiaomi Mi Mix looks very tempting, but let's look how the device performs in the real world and how does it compete with the other similarly priced devices.. Xiaomi Mi Mix 2: Build Quality. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 has an excellent build quality; it feels sturdy and does not make any creaking sounds even when trying to flex it. However, the device is very slippery. Therefore, it tends to slip easily from the hand and other surfaces while using it, but that is the case with almost all the flagship smartphones nowadays, so we cannot really blame Xiaomi. Nonetheless, the Mi Mix 2 survived a few minor drops.. As for the looks of the device, it looks good but still lacks behind the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and the LG V30+ due to lack of sharp design. We also hate the weird camera placement, which in the real world usage gives a lot of trouble. We hope that Xiaomi fixes these issues in the successor of the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2.. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 comes with a 5.99-inch Full HD+ (2160 x 1080) IPS LCD display with a bezel-less design. The device looks futuristic with the bezel-less design, better than the Nokia 8, which is priced similarly, but to be honest, the Mi Mix 2 still doesn’t look as good as the Samsung Galaxy S8+ or the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Also, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 doesn’t feature an AMOLED display. Therefore, it looses when compared with the similarly priced OnePlus 5T. We think that the device should have been equipped with an AMOLED display, which would have made much more sense, as the display is the main focus of the device. Nonetheless, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2’s display has punchy colours, and excellent visibility under sunlight.. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 comes with a single 12MP primary camera with phase-detection autofocus, 4-axis OIS, dual-tone dual-LED flash. However, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 doesn’t come with any kind of background blur or portrait mode technology as it doesn’t have two cameras, or the intelligent AI as that on the Google Pixel 2. Therefore, it loses in that criteria when compared with the similarly priced OnePlus 5T and the Nokia 8.. The daylight images captured with the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 look sharp, and they contain a lot of details; the colour accuracy is superb too. In daylight, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 gives a tough competition to the OnePlus 5T and Nokia 8. However, the story changes in the low-light conditions. We found that the images captured with Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 in low-light conditions contain high-amount of noise, low details, artificial sharpening, and lastly, low brightness. It looses completely when compared with the OnePlus 5T in low-light conditions.. Coming to the front-facing camera performance, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 looses again, as not only the 5MP camera falls short of delivering detailed and bright images that the competitors like the OnePlus 5T and the Nokia 8 offer, but the weird placement of the camera makes it hard to capture images. We wonder, why Xiaomi didn’t equip such a costly device with a higher resolution camera, as even the devices priced at Rs. 15,000 to Rs, 20,000 are equipped with higher resolution cameras. Also worth mentioning is that the Mi Mix 2 doesn’t feature a display flash to aid in low-light conditions, which is kind of disappointing.. Unfortunately, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 completely looses in the camera department due to relatively poor primary camera performance in low-light and a weaker front-facing camera performance due to less-equipped hardware.. Xiaomi Mi Mix 2: Software & Performance. The Xiaomi Mix 2 is equipped with an octa-core Snapdragon 835 processor, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. The device has a very smooth and fluid performance. During our test, the device did not show any frame drops or lags even during heavy multitasking. Thanks to the Adreno 540 GPU, the Mi Mix 2 has an excellent gaming performance. We were also glad to see that the device did not heat up while paying graphics-heavy games and while performing heavy multitasking.. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 ships with the Android 7.1.1 Nougat OS customised with MIUI 9. The MIUI 9 has tons of improvements over the older MIUI 8. The most important change is the inclusion of split-screen multitasking and quick replies in the notification pane. The absence of these two features was really frustrating in the MIUI 8. The Mi Video app that comes with the MIUI 9 is a great addition; it has a good design and packs useful features. Xiaomi has also enhanced the Mi Drop, calendar, and image editor. Also, many UI elements have been redesigned in the MIUI 9 to give it a better look, but still the MIUI 9 lacks behind in the design when compared to the UI from other smartphone manufacturers like HTC and Samsung.. Xiaomi needs to improve a lot in the design criteria. Especially, the icon style needs to be improved; the existing boxy icon design looks outdated. The exclusion of an application drawer is also very frustrating; Xiaomi should at least add an option to use the device with an application drawer so that the users shifting from other UIs feel comfortable to use the MIUI 9. Apart from these issues, we think that MIUI 9 is pretty much equipped with every essential feature.. Xiaomi Mi Mix 2: Battery Life. We were expecting the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 to deliver a good battery backup as it has a large battery and a low power consuming LCD display, and the smartphone did not disappoint us. During our test, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 delivered an excellent battery backup. The device lasts about 28 to 36 hours with an average screen-on time of 4 to 5 hours. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 beats the Galaxy Note 8 and even the HTC U11 in terms of battery backup. Thanks to the Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0, the Mi Mix 2 charges super fast; it charges in about just 120 minutes.. Considering the bezel-less display, Snapdragon 835 processor, 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, 3340mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0, and an OIS-equipped primary camera, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is a very tempting device. Sadly, those features fall short when compared to the newly launched OnePlus 5T, which has an AMOLED display, and dual-camera setup over the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2. We think that OnePlus 5T provides with a better camera, better display, and a more practical design than the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 at the same price.. The Xiaomi Mi Mix was the first smartphone of its kind to feature a truly bezel-less display. The things are even better with the new Xiaomi Mi Mix 2. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 comes with a better display, better design, and new hardware technologies.. The most amazing thing about the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is its bezel-less display with which the device looks truly futuristic. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 does not have an earpiece or a camera on the upper front due to its bezel-less 5.9-inch display. The successor to the Mi Mix now comes with an IPS LCD display. The resolution remains unchanged at Full HD (2040x1080). The display is protected with Gorilla Glass, and it has curved edges to increase the usability and screen-to-body ratio of the device further. Another interesting thing about the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is that the device has a front-facing camera on the bottom of the device. Therefore, you have to first rotate the device to take a proper selfie. The front-facing camera is a traditional 5MP unit, whereas the primary camera is a 12-megapixel unit with phase-detection autofocus and LED flash.. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is a true powerhouse with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset coupled with a massive 6GB of RAM. The internal storage capacity is 128GB. However, there is no microSD card slot.. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 comes with Android 7.1 Nougat operating system out-of-the-box. The user interface has been customised by Xiaomi’s new MIUI 9.. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 draws its juice from a 3,400mAh non-removable Li-Ion battery. The device benefits from the Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4 technology for faster and efficient charging through USB Power Delivery.. In spite of having a very compact body, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 still manages to provide dual-SIM functionality. Other connectivity options include 4G, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, NFC, and a microUSB Type-C port..

The Mi Mix 2 offers incredible power, great looks and an excellent user interface experience at a price that puts many other top-tier phones to shame.. Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 price and availability Starts at approximately £430/$575/AU$840 Available from online re-sellers Design Ceramic back, metal on the edges and Gorilla Glass 4 on front Stunning finish on the scratch-proof ceramic back Back is fragile and attracts fingerprints Display 5.99-inch IPS FHD display 18:9 aspect ratio. We have seen some fascinating smartphone innovations in recent years, but if there's one evolution that has gone on to become a genuine head-turner, it would be 2016's Xiaomi Mi Mix.. This trend-setter kicked off a bezel-less trend which has arguably culminated in the wallet-destroying iPhone X , and now the entire industry appears to be gripped with the desire to drastically reduce those bezels at all cost.. With the Mi Mix, Chinese firm Xiaomi made a striking statement, not just from a design perspective but from a business one, too – it wants to be considered an equal to the big players in the global smartphone arena.. The company has now reworked the original design and returned with the new Mi Mix 2, a more refined, logical and a favorable implementation of the bezel-less concept it did so much to promote.. Since the Mi Mix blazed its trail a year ago, we have seen a handful of smartphones thinning down the bezels and maximizing that all-important screen-to-body ratio.. From the Samsung Galaxy S8 , LG G6 and Essential Phone to the aforementioned iPhone X, the big talking point of 2017 is minimal bezel design – so much so that otherwise excellent devices like the standard-sized Google Pixel 2 have been branded "old-fashioned" for failing to follow the same trend.. The downside for Xiaomi is obvious; while the Chinese firm may have started this particular party, it's been joined by some pretty popular new guests.. The Mi Mix 2 is Xiaomi's chance to reassert its dominance in this particular realm – and it's also the handset that the company has chosen to spearhead its expansion into Europe. Can it hope to compete with the likes of Apple, Samsung and LG? Let's find out.. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 has launched in certain parts of Europe but isn’t officially available in the UK, US or Australia. However, it does support LTE just about everywhere in the world, so you can safely import it from online re-sellers such as Gearbest .. The Mi Mix 2's pricing places it firmly in the mid-range sector of the market, where it is likely to face stiff competition from the OnePlus 5T , another big-screen challenger.. The base model comes with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage for around £430/$575/AU$840. If you want more internal space then you can go all the way up to 256GB for roughly £100/$75/AU$85 extra.. A super-premium model is also available in China which has 8GB of RAM and an entirely ceramic body.. As there's not currently a means of purchasing the phone without importing, expect to pay a little for international shipping and potentially some more on top if your parcel is intercepted by customs when it arrives in the country.. When it comes to aesthetics the Mi Mix 2 really hits the ball out of the park. Conceived by famous French designer Philippe Starck, the phone combines a premium feel with gorgeous looks which are relatively unique in this price bracket.. Many of the design cues witnessed in the Mi Mix have been retained, but the use of a 5.99-inch display in place of the huge 6.4-inch panel seen on its predecessor makes the Mix 2 shorter by 7mm and narrower by 6.4mm. All of this trimming has resulted in an overall weight of 185g, which is 24g lighter than the original Mi Mix. Some complained that the 2016 model was simply too large to use, and it seems that Xiaomi has taken this feedback on board and created a more manageable device.. The Mi Mix 2 has a ceramic back reinforced by an aluminum frame. Ceramic isn't a common material when it comes to smartphone manufacture, and it comes with positives and negatives.. It looks amazing and cannot be scratched easily, but it is very fragile and picks up fingerprints with alarming regularity; it's also incredibly slippy.. The sides are aluminum, which lends the phone a robust feel, while the screen is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for protection.. A plastic hard-case is included in the box – Xiaomi's way of admitting that it has created a beautiful but easily-dropped handset – and while it still looks great with the case fitted, it's a shame to have to cover up that stunning design.. On the front of the Mi Mix 2 there's no space for bezels except on the chin, just below the screen. Xiaomi didn't go the Apple or Essential route by including an obtrusive "notch" for the front camera at the top of the display.. Instead, the camera is located below the screen, a move which is sure to divide opinion and something we'll talk about later.. Xiaomi didn't just banish bezels this time around - it has also done away with a 3.5mm audio jack, with a USB Type-C to 3.5mm connector (kindly provided in the box) providing your only means of using wired cans.. On top of the display, you'll see a small earpiece which peeps out of a tiny cut-out in the middle of the glass; the impressive but ultimately flawed "cantilever piezoelectric ceramic acoustic technology" earpiece used on the original Mi Mix has gone, which is definitely a positive as it was hard to hear in noisy environments.. In terms of the more mundane design details, the dual-SIM slot is on the left and the right edge has the volume rocker and power/lock key.. The super-fast and reliable fingerprint scanner is placed in an optimal position on the rear – just where your index finger rests, in fact – and is accompanied by Xiaomi's branding that reads "MIX designed by Xiaomi" in gold.. Speaking of which, the camera has a gold ring around it which really pops against that lovely black ceramic.. Xiaomi has bucked the trend of 2017 by not giving the Mi Mix 2 any kind of water or dust resistance, so be careful using it near water – it might not survive an accidental dunk.. With a screen-to-body ratio of over 80%, it should come as no surprise that the defining feature of the Mi Mix 2 is its display. Xiaomi has gone with a 1080 x 2160 resolution despite the massive 5.99-inch screen, which showcases an 18:9 aspect ratio with round corners.. While some may grumble about the lack of a QHD panel, the display looks great regardless and it's practically impossible to pick out individual pixels, even close up.. The IPS display slightly softens its punch to retain an eye-pleasing viewing experience, while the screen brightness is akin to what we've seen on LG displays and offers a good balance of brightness and color.. Compared to AMOLED panels on phones like the Galaxy S8 or OnePlus 5T, it is a little less saturated. Color reproduction is on point, and if you like vivid colors then you can always tweak things from the settings – just don’t expect it to get anywhere near the impact of the Galaxy S8’s Super AMOLED screen.. Using the Mi Mix 2 outdoors is not a problem as it adjusts the brightness to a readable limit in almost no time.. One minor complaint is that the adaptive brightness is often a little too aggressive when indoors, dimming the screen down to the point where it's hard to make out images – thankfully you can adjust this from the swipe-down notification pane at any time.. If you're on the hunt for the best possible smartphone display then you might prefer the Galaxy S8 to this. But on a phone with such an immersive front panel, the display on the Mi Mix 2 certainly does not disappoint; it's great for reading, watching video content or just browsing the web. Viewing angles are also really impressive, even in well-lit conditions.. Next Page Battery life and camera.

Even before the Samsung Galaxy S8, Apple iPhone X and Essential PH1 embraced an edge-to-edge screen, Xiaomi shook the industry with its Mi MIX, a stunning smartphone with an all-screen front, a 91.3% screen-to-body ratio, and a ceramic body.. Even though the Mi MIX launched as a concept smartphone exclusively in China, it got a wide attention and mostly positive reviews.. Almost one year after the launch of the original Mi MIX, Xiaomi’s bezel-less smartphone has gotten a due successor, the Mi MIX 2. The phone is no longer a China-exclusive and launched in India today with a price tag of Rs 35, 999. The smartphone isn’t just an upgrade over the predecessor in terms of specifications, but also has a new design. At the same time it retains the essence of what the original Mi MIX stood for - a truly all-screen phone.. We have been using the Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 for roughly a week, and here our first impressions of the device. Before we hold forth, note that the model which we were using was a China version, so the experience, especially the software bit, is most likely to be different on the India variant.. The Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 does resemble the original Mi MIX, but that’s not a negative. Even if you haven’t seen the original Mi MIX, the new Xiaomi smartphone is going to grab your attention with its unique form factor.. The Mi MIX 2 is also quite different from what you most probably have seen on other 18:9 screen phones. While the likes of Canvas Infinity or LG Q6 bring a taller screen, but don’t really come close to becoming an all-screen smartphone.. We have extensively used the Galaxy Note 8 , and we must say the Mi MIX 2, sheer in terms of all-screen front, looks a way lot better.. The Mi MIX 2 comes with a full HD+ resolution (2160 x 1080 pixels), which is pretty good. It renders pretty decent outdoor and indoor legibility. If you like more vibrant colours, you can always go to Settings and choose between warm, standard and cool modes. We mostly used the phone in standard colour mode. There’s also an option to optimise contrast so that the content is crisper.. While the original Mi MIX sported a larger 6.44-inch display, the MIX 2 has a more compact 5.99-inch display. A compact size makes it easier to fit in our palms and suitable for one hand usage. The front is dominated by the display, well, it covers 80% of the real estate. While there’s an ultra slim bezel on the top, the bottom has a relatively broader bezel.. 5.99-inch, 18:9 display with 2160 × 1080 resolution (FHD+), 403 PPI 7-series aluminium alloy frame, four-sided curved ceramic body 18k gold-plated camera rim 12MP rear camera with Sony IMX386 camera sensor, 4-axis OIS, large 1.25μm pixels 5MP front camera Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 6GB LPDDR4X RAM + 128GB internal storage 3400mA battery MIUI 8 based on Android N Global LTE support, 6 modes 43 bands, Dual SIM, Bluetooth 5.0, Rear fingerprint sensor. A senior Xiaomi executive told us a broader bezel at the bottom was required to ensure there’s enough breathing space between the components.. It is worth pointing out that the front-facing camera lens has been shifted to the bottom right corner, since the top has an ultra slim bezel. In our opinion, a broader bezel doesn’t really affect the overall aesthetics.. The back panel of the Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 is equally beautiful. Sporting a ceramics panel, the rear has a glossy finish, giving it a premium look and feel. It features a camera set up on the top center followed by the fingerprint sensor. There’s subtle branding “MIX DESIGNED BY XIAOMI” engraved on the panel. The shiny back panel of the MIX 2 is good to look at but, there’s one major problem - it’s a fingerprint magnet.. The Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 has a ceramic back panel.. This essentially means you will have to keep wiping the back to keep the polish on. Fortunately, unlike the glass backs, a ceramics panel seems much easier to clean up. If you don’t really like the habit of wiping the phone back, you will have to put on a cover, which we think will murder the beauty that the Mi MIX 2 is.. Moving on to other sections of the phone, the base has USB Type-C port sandwiched between speaker grilles whereas the top has, well nothing. The Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 joins the increasing number of smartphones to abandon the 3.5mm audio jack. Volume and power buttons are located on the right edge whereas the left edge sports the SIM slot. All the necessary buttons are well within the reach. It’s slim and light enough to carry around in your pocket without any hassle.. Xiaomi has certainly raised the design bar with the Mi MIX 2, but it doesn’t fulfil all of our wish list. As we mentioned earlier, it’s located at the corner right of the front. This means whenever you’re taking a selfie, you will have to strategically hold the device so that your palm doesn’t cover up the lens. Xiaomi has given a fix for this. You need to flip the phone upside down while taking selfies. It’s a bit of habitual change for a lot of us, and certainly takes a lot of time to get used to.. Another problem is that the “upside down” feature hasn’t been optimised for Facebook or Instagram, which means an additional step to post photos to these social media apps. If you share a lot of Stories on Facebook or Instagram, the Mi MIX 2 front-camera is going to be a downer. That being said, the front-camera does take pretty neat selfies, of course, when you have learned the method to use it. But that’s a trade off you will have to make for this bezel-less brute.. The Mi MIX 2 also misses out on dual-rear camera, a hot trend in 2017. But the single 12-megapixel sensor coupled with 4-axis Optical Image Stablisation (OIS) does take pretty decent photos. They aren’t breathtaking, but decent enough for a mid-range smartphone. Though after having used the iPhone 8 and Galaxy Note 8, the Mi MIX 2 camera performance seems underwhelming.. A closer look at the Xiaomi Mi MIX 2. The smartphone is powered by Qualcomm’s top-end Snapdragon 835 processor coupled with 6GB of RAM. During our week-long experience, there was no log or stutter. Though in all fairness, we haven’t tested the performance of the smartphone as we would have liked. Since the test unit we had was a China model, it will be unfair to comment on the software experience.. Summing up, the Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 is a gorgeous smartphone. With a shrunk 5.99-inch size, it feels compact and easy to use. The iPhone X , which has similar all-screen front, will cost you an arm and leg, whereas there’s no word on the Essential PH1 coming to the Indian market anytime sooner. If you have been looking for an all-screen phone or just a phone that’s different from the rest, the Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 is worth considering..
