Actually quite a few people have had camera problems on this phone. I don't think the built quality was as good as the Nokia 800 days.. Window Phone 8.1 though is still good, Windows could have built on that and improved it over time but they didn't. Obviously main problem now is no more support and not many apps left so you have to go Android..

Esto también se puede leer en español.. Affable, affordable Lumia 830 does the 'Nokia' name proud. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good Smart-looking with satisfying mid-range power, the Lumia 830 packs in more features than you'd expect at this price range, including the impressive PureView camera.. The Bad A 720p screen seems a little disappointing on anything with the title 'flagship'. Windows, as always, suffers when it comes to your choice of apps in the marketplace.. The Bottom Line A great example of a Windows-based smartphone and a killer option for what it costs, although there's still not quite enough going on with Windows Phone to pull people away from Android or iOS.. The Nokia Lumia 830 is an affordable flagship smartphone, but it's also a swansong for the venerable Finnish company. Nokia's name is on the way out, and Microsoft will be the brand of choice for the next generation of Lumia phones, with the Microsoft Lumia 535 to be the first successor to the Nokia line.. As far as legacy is concerned, there are worse notes to end on. The Lumia 830 is pitched as "the affordable flagship" and it's hard to argue with that. A good combination of solid design, a well-rounded feature set, the 10-megapixel PureView camera and a mid-range price tag all make this phone a welcome addition to the Windows Phone family.. That price, by the way, is $99 on contract with AT&T in the US ($450 outright), AU$579 in Australia, and in the UK you can grab it direct from Microsoft for £287.10. (Carphone Warehouse also have it for £29.99 upfront on a £22.50 per month contract.). The Lumia 830 bears all the usual design hallmarks seen on the premium end of the Lumia range. The plastic back panel is a matte finish while the metal edge harkens back to the bigger sibling, the Lumia 930 .. For my money though, I like the darker metal finish on the model we had in for review more than the brightness of the 930's edge -- it comes off a little less flashy and I'm quite comfortable with that.. With a black rear case and a dark metal rim, the 830 looked quietly competent and every part a premium phone. Of course, if you want, Microsoft will also sell it to you in white, bright orange and a stunningly virulent green, shown above.. The slightly rounded edges and slick glass front all add up to a phone that feels great in the hand. The back also offers some actual grip when being held (as opposed to, for example, the Sony Xperia Z3 which may as well be coated in Teflon).. At 150g (5.29 ounces) it weighs a little less than the 930, despite being roughly the same size. Metal buttons to control volume, power and the camera shutter all sit down the right size, while a MicroUSB and headphone jack sit up the top. The rear comes off for access to the SIM and MicroSB slots -- no need to track down that SIM tray key you keep losing.. While the screen is the same size as the 930, sadly it's not Full HD. The Lumia 830's 5-inch screen has 1,280x720 resolution with a pixel density of 226ppi. That's a little lower than what you'd normally expect from a flagship, but the IPS-LCD panel is quite bright, and even when watching videos I didn't find myself pining for Full HD (or beyond). That said, for a phone touting this level of camera quality, some users may find the lack of a 1080p screen on which to review said snap an odd choice.. Readability in direct light was quite impressive thanks to Nokia's ClearBlack filter, although it drops off sharply when you change viewing angles.. The Lumia 830 is shipping with the Microsoft Windows Denim update, which brings an impressive raft of changes for Windows Phone in general, as well as some tweaks exclusive to the Lumia range.. Many of these revolve around the camera -- handy, given the aforementioned PureView snapper packed in. The update will change the name of the Nokia Camera app to Lumia Camera, but also add some features. For example, a long press on the camera button will kick off Moment Capture and the phone will instantly start recording in 4K video. You'll also get Auto HDR and dynamic flash, as well as better low-light shooting.. In the US, Cortana will now wake up just via saying "Hey, Cortana". The voice assistant service still has catching up to do in the rest of the world. It will hit beta in the UK and public alpha in Australia.. Sadly, while our review version said it was running Denim -- and gave us new features like VPN and the ability to create folders -- it didn't have the Lumia Camera installed by default, and there was no 4K option to be seen. It did, however, come with the Lumia Cinemagraph app for creating images with animated areas, Lumia Creative Suite for image manipulation, and even Lumia Selfie, which does what it says on the tin.. As always, Windows Phone feels like a good OS right on the verge of becoming great. It's simple and intuitive with some very nice touches and a great home screen, but the app store still feels like a wild west frontier town full of either devs you've never heard of or outright tumbleweeds where apps should be. In essence, it's still lacking that critical mass to make it worthwhile jumping from Android or iOS.. That said, if you're currently using an older version of Windows Phone (or BBOS), then this will probably rock your socks.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News.

Low pixel density screen (294 ppi). The successor to the Lumia 820 is another colorful Windows Phone with signature characteristics like a Lumia 1020-like 10MP PureView rear camera with OIS, a removable back cover, and hardware capacitive buttons. Designed as an affordable high-end device, the Lumia 830 houses a 5-inch 720p panel, and it's powered by a quad-core Snapdragon CPU. It runs on Windows Phone 8.1 with the Lumia Denim update.. Nokia Lumia 830 Review Nokia Lumia 830 hands-on: the Denim demon Nokia Lumia 830 benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.49 x 2.78 x 0.33 inches (139.4 x 70.7 x 8.5 mm). Weight: 5.29 oz (150 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 5.0 inches. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Optical image stabilization, Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Touch to focus, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, Panorama, Night mode, Scenes, Effects. Features: Optical image stabilization, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 12.90 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 22.0 days (528 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 14.80 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback, Dolby Digital Plus.

These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

The Nokia Lumia 830 is a smartphone developed by Microsoft Mobile and branded as " Nokia " that runs Microsoft's Windows Phone 8.1 operating system. It was announced on September 4, 2014 at Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin [3] and released in October 2014. [4] It is a successor to the 2012 Nokia Lumia 820 and marketed as an "affordable flagship". The Lumia 830 has a metal frame with a removable polycarbonate back. It is available in multiple colours - white, orange, green and black. The Lumia 830 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 MSM8926 SoC with a 1.2. GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU and a Qualcomm Adreno 305 GPU. GB of internal storage; the latter can be expanded with MicroSD cards up to 128. The Lumia 830 has a 5.0. mm) IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1280x720 and an aspect ratio of 16:9. The display features Nokia's ClearBlack polarisation filters and is protected by curved Gorilla Glass 3.. The Lumia 830 has a 10. MP PureView-branded rear camera, sporting a 1/3.4-inch BSI sensor with 1.12. μm pixels, and an optically stabilised Carl Zeiss 6-element lens with an f/2.2 aperture. The camera supports 1080p video capture and is complemented by an LED flash and a two-stage shutter button. The front camera has a 0.9. MP sensor with a wide-angle f/2.4 lens, and supports 720p video recording.. The Lumia 830 supports 4G LTE technology with maximum transfer speeds of 150. Other wireless connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a / b / g / n , Wi-Fi hotspot , NFC , Bluetooth 4.0, and wireless screen projection via Miracast. Physical connectors include a Micro-USB 2.0 connector for charging and data transfer, as well as a 3.5. The Lumia 830 supports wireless inductive charging using the Qi standard. The AT&T version additionally supports the PMA standard. The Lumia 830 includes a variety of sensors, including proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, magnetometer, gyroscope and accelerometer, as well as Microsoft's Motion Data activity tracker based on Qualcomm 's SensorCore technology. [7] Due to chipset limitations, however, it does not support passive voice activation for the Cortana digital assistant. The Lumia 830 ships with Microsoft's Windows Phone 8.1 operating system coupled with the Lumia Denim firmware update .. The new Lumia Camera app in the Denim firmware update adds support for Rich Capture ( HDR imaging ), DNG capture and Moment Capture (high-quality 2. MP stills extraction from 1080p video). The Lumia 830 can be upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile. The Lumia 830 has received mixed to positive reviews. Most critics commended the design, build quality and camera performance, as well as the availability of several high-end features at a mid-range price. On the other hand, many reviewers found fault with the chipset performance, display resolution and the overall Windows Phone app ecosystem (as compared to Android and iOS). Several reviews drew attention to the fact that the Lumia 830 would be the last Nokia-branded smartphone, with future models carrying the Microsoft Mobile brand instead.. Engadget gave the Lumia 830 a rating of 80/100, calling the rear camera "impressive" and praising the premium design and solid battery life, while criticising performance in graphics-intensive games and gaps in the app ecosystem, particularly for Google's services. Editor Philip Palermo concluded the review writing: "... in general, life was rather pleasant with the 830. It's an Icon(ic) phone that cuts most of the right corners." [13]. Lee Bell of The Inquirer described the Lumia 830 as offering many of the same features as the higher-end Lumia 930 while being more compact, commended the availability of multiple colours and called the display "the most impressive we've seen on a Nokia Lumia device". [14] A later review by Alastair Stevenson praised the impressive camera, as well as the enterprise and productivity features, while criticising the performance of Internet Explorer and the lack of "many apps that certain users will rely on for personal use". Brett Howse of AnandTech called the Lumia 830 "one of the best Nokia phones launched [in 2014]", praising the design and ergonomics, but finding that the performance does not measure up to the "affordable flagship" moniker. The review concluded with: "The combination of the metal band, a thin chassis, a light weight, a decent display, and a decent camera make for a phone that is very good for the right price", but also noted that the phone costs more than it should in many regions. Ivan Petkov of GSMArena.com highlighted the phone's design and build quality as positives, and found no major problems with performance, saying that the operating system runs "buttery smooth, without any lags whatsoever". New features added in Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 and the Lumia Denim firmware update were also praised, while the main downside was seen to be the availability of mid-range Android phones that offer comparable or better specifications for the same or lower price. Andy Vandervell of Trusted Reviews gave the Lumia 830 a score of 8/10, saying it compares favourably to the higher-end Lumia 930 in terms of design, and praising the camera's low-light capabilities. Poor performance in certain games was once again pointed out as a weakness, and the phone was said to be "useless as an in-car sat nav " due to the placement of the buttons and Micro-USB connector. Nic Healey of CNET gave the phone a favourable review, listing the camera, design and overall value as positives and saying that "the Lumia 830 does its dynasty proud". The main criticisms were against the 720p display and the appeal, or lack thereof, of the Windows Phone ecosystem. Business Insider UK ranked the Lumia 830 as 15th in their best smartphones list. ^ "Nokia Lumia 830 - Slim Stylish Smartphone with Windows". ^ Lumia 840 coming soon as Microsoft discontinues Lumia 830 silently. ^ Hachman, Mark (September 4, 2014).

There was an error emailing this page.. Microsoft announces two Lumia phones, always-on Cortana, and clever new mobile.... Microsoft Lumia 640 review: It's the practical Windows Phone most people can.... The first Microsoft-branded Windows Phone rolls out: The unremarkable Lumia 535. Build 2015: Windows 10 in 3 minutes. Performance and battery life Mark Hachman. The camera: Competent, with some flaws Mark Hachman. Not the Denim phone you might be expecting Mark Hachman. Mark Hachman An affordable flagship, indeed. To date, the Nokia Lumia Icon has topped the list of my favorite Windows Phones. But if you invest $99 to buy the new Microsoft Nokia Lumia 830 via AT&T, you’ll be handed a thinner, lighter phone that’s equally robust, which you may even prefer to the older model.. My one disappointment is that the global version of the phone that Microsoft loaned me did not include some of the best features of Lumia Denim, the. firmware update that debuts on the 830 and similar phones. And on paper, the 830 is a step down from the Icon in display quality and camera resolution.. Still, the 830 is a quality midrange phone with an upgrade path to some of Denim, backed by solid performance under the hood. is Microsoft’s newfound strategy: Attack the midrange and low end to increase its market share, with decent phones for everyday use. And if you act fast, you’ll get a free Fitbit, too .. Like the Icon, the Lumia 830 appears cut from a solid slab of aluminum, but with a plastic backing carved out of Microsoft’s electric Lumia colors. Underneath hides one advantage over the Icon: an easily accessible (128 GB) microSD slot, supplementing the 16GB built-in memory.. Placed next to each other, the Lumia 830 (left) is thinner, which you'll notice as soon as you pick it up, too.. While the 830 measures 139.4 mm x 70.7 mm, about the same size as the Icon, the difference is the thickness and weight: It’s 1.3 mm thinner, and at 150 grams, noticeably lighter than the Icon’s 167 grams. And yes, there’s a dedicated camera button. (Microsoft has published the full specs of the Lumia 830 here .). The differences extend to the internals. While both phones sport 5-inch screens, the 830 uses a. 1,280x720 IPS display, a relatively archaic resolution in a generation where premium displays are moving to quad-HD resolutions. And Microsoft’s 830 also uses a 1.2GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chip alongside 1GB of RAM, a step or two down from the 800 chip the Icon uses. I wasn’t pleased with the effect that 512MB of RAM had on the Lumia 635 , but right now Windows Phone apps running in 1GB of memory seem like an acceptable compromise. The transition between apps and the home screen staggered occasionally, but that seemed anomalous compared against the overall, smooth experience.. Surprisingly, that extended to games as well. Windows Phone doesn’t have too many games that push the hardware to the limits, but Gameloft’s Asphalt 8: Airborne does. While the Icon powers the game fluidly, you’ll notice a tiny bit of stuttering with the 830. In all, however, the game plays more than acceptably. Ditto for games like Beach Buggy Racing and the like.. This was shot in the afternoon, but the Lumia 830's display is perfectly legible throughout the day.. When tested against popular benchmarks, however, the Lumia 830 doesn’t measure up. Using SunSpider 1.0.2 (where shorter is better), the phone averaged 1.24 seconds, more than double the 0.52 seconds the Icon required. With Antutu 0.8 beta (where higher is better), the Icon scored 24, 600, while the Lumia 830 averaged 10, 969--a 55 percent decrease. WPBench (where higher is better) also reported similar results: 505.0 for the Icon, and 242.8 for the Lumia 830--a 52 percent decrease.. Inside the 830 sits a removable 2,200 mAh battery, compared to a 2,420 mAh battery in the Icon. I found it perfectly acceptable for all-day, moderate use (using it more to browse the Web and use apps than making calls). If that’s your typical use case, good news: Microsoft rates Wi-Fi browsing at 14 hours, versus 9 hours for the Icon, and 10 hours for video playback. That’s partially due to the lower-resolution screen, I suspect—which, I should note, is also more legible under direct sunlight than the Icon's, thanks to the IPS display technology. And if you want to recharge it, you have the option of wired or Qi-compatible wireless charging.. While a Lumia camera can’t compete with a modern SLR, I think most people now recognize that they’ve replaced the point-and-shoot. In full light, the 10MP PureView sensor grabs crisp, clean images with vibrant color. Note than the sensor in the Lumia 830 is 0.29 inches, versus 0.4 inches for the Icon, so there’s less surface area to capture images in low light. The 830 has an f/2.2 lens.. Even on a cloudy day, the Lumia 830 color looks excellent, and the details are sharp.. I wasn’t as impressed with the Lumia 830's low-light shots as I was with the Icon's, or the HTC One (M8)'s , whose sensor was specifically designed for that purpose. I noticed a hazing effect when shooting into a sunset that I didn’t with the other phones, and low-light images were somewhat noisy. The 830 has optical image stabilization, however, which does help steady the camera’s lens when taking those longer-exposure shots. That helps the camera continuously stabilize itself when shooting video, too, at its maximum resolution of 1080p.. In low light, things get grainy fast.. One of the most desirable elements with Denim, in my mind, are the slew of improvements that will accompany the Lumia Camera app: faster shot-to-shot performance, auto HDR, dynamic flash, and more. But the Lumia Camera feature will be added later, a Microsoft spokesman told me—probably sooner than later, if I had to guess. And Moment Capture, where you can trigger a 4K video shoot via a long press of the camera button, will record only in 1080p quality on the 830. Although the front-facing camera on the Lumia 830 is a paltry 0.9MP, a new app, called Lumia Selfie, helps solve that shortcoming. With Lumia Selfie, you can shoot a selfie with the external camera, pointing it at your face. You can’t see yourself in the viewfinder, but the camera looks for your face, alerts you with a rapid series of beeps, then snaps the shot. Aside from a tendency to focus on the background, the app works well, putting your face front-and-center in the frame.. Bing Vision, Lumia Cinemagraph, Lumia Panorama, and Lumia Refocus. The latter three didn’t come with the phone, but I could download them from the Store.. As I mentioned before, the Lumia 830. does include Denim, just not the fun stuff. Lumia Camera has been left out. And the other feature I’d like to try out, Cortana’s active listening mode, will not appear on the Lumia 830 (but will on the Icon, the 930, and the 1520.) Cortana, Microsoft’s digital assistant, normally requires a keypress to trigger it. When the feature goes live on the other phones, you’ll be able to say “Hey, Cortana!” and ask her to do your bidding.. Otherwise, the Lumia 830 also ships with Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1, which offers the opportunity to group applications into folders, set up a VPN, and group SMS messages for easy processing.. Live folders are a handy feature in Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1.. However, I do like one Lumia-specific Denim feature, the integration of either Bing Health & Fitness or Bing Weather onto the lock screen. I still think it’s odd that Microsoft chose to bundle the Fitbit Flex, not its competing Microsoft Band, with the phone. But if you’re a walker, you don’t need either; the Lumia 830 is one of the few with the SensorCore package, which has a built-in pedometer. In lock mode, you can automatically see how many steps you’ve taken, which is handy.. As I’ve noted elsewhere, I usually carry two phones: a Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and one of several Windows Phones, swapping SIMs back and forth as needed. The Android ecosystem seems obsessed with specs, dissecting screen size, display resolution, memory, and CPU speeds to determine the best solution. Move to a Windows Phone, though, and those distinctions just don't seem that relevant. As the benchmarks showed, the Lumia 830 is a substantial step down on paper. But in real-world testing, the differences weren't that noticeable.. I really liked the Lumia Icon, and HTC has done a fine job with the One (M8). But the Lumia 830 is very good phone, and a relative bargain to boot.. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.. Microsoft correctly labels the Nokia Lumia 830 as an "affordable flagship," with an appealing mix of performance, features, and price. And the phone will improve somewhat once Microsoft pushes the Lumia Camera app to the phone.. Thin, relatively light, but with a solid feel. Phone's photo-taking abilities will improve with Lumia Camera app. Camera currently struggles in low light. "Hey Cortana!" active listening won't be supported. Still lags behind iOS, Android in quality apps. As PCWorld's senior editor, Mark focuses on Microsoft news and chip technology, among other beats..

The Lumia 830 is the kind of phone you should consider if you want a ‘flagship’ style phone but can’t afford an iPhone 6 , Galaxy S5 or a Lumia 930. There are compromises to fit its £320 SIM-free price (from £22 a month on contract), but it looks and feels the part.. Key to its appeal is the camera, a 10-megapixel effort with built-in optical image stabilisation (OIS). OIS helps counteract camera shake and should help produce brighter, sharper photos in gloomy light. Many far more expensive phones don’t have OIS, and the hugely expensive iPhone 6 Plus is the only one of the two new iPhones to feature it. Is this enough to elevate it above similar price phones like the LG G3 and Nexus 5? Read on to find out.. SEE ALSO: Best Cheap Smartphones. There are two things that earn the Lumia 830 its ‘affordable flagship’ tag, the camera and the design. Like the Lumia 930, which sits above the 830 in the Windows Phone lineup, the Lumia 830 has a 5-inch screen and it shares the same basic design. Well, it’s the same, only better. It shares the metal trim, colourful plastic rear and black glass front, but it’s thinner, lighter and easier to hold.. The differences sound small, the Lumia 830 is 150g and 8.5mm thick against the 167g and 9.8mm of the 930, but the difference is palpable. The Lumia 930 felt chunky, unwieldy and cumbersome, the Lumia 830 doesn’t. In a blind test you would assume the Lumia 830 was the more expensive of the two.. SEE ALSO: Best Windows Phone Round-up. That’s a good start and the plus points keep coming. That rear cover is removable, so you can access and replace the battery and add a microSD card. The Lumia 930 had neither option. Moreover, the Lumia 830 doesn’t lose many features in return — it still has a dedicated camera shutter button, it still supports wireless charging and it includes NFC as well. So what gives to keep the Lumia cheaper? The main difference is a much slower processor; in fact the Lumia 830 carries the same Snapdragon 400 chip as the sub-£200 Lumia 735. It also has a smaller battery and, unsurprisingly, a lower resolution 720p screen. You don’t get 802.11ac Wi-Fi either, though we doubt many people will miss that.. All told, it sounds like an impressive package and it’s a good-looking one, too. It shares the same orange, green, white and black options as its brethren, and the build quality can’t be faulted. Putting the plastic cover back on is a bit fiddly, as is removing a microSD card (we needed a paperclip to prise it out), but these aren’t things you’ll do often.. Our most serious complaint is that the Lumia 830 is useless as an in-car sat nav. Why? One, because the three buttons on the right edge leave no space to clamp the phone with a holder; two, because the mini USB charging port is at the top and the phone won’t auto rotate to show the display upside down. Switching to landscape view would fix the first problem, but the second is hard to solve. It’s a shame given Nokia’s Here Drive app is so good, but this only matters if you use your phone for navigation often.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy. One final trivial concern is we found it too easy to jog the volume controls by accident, particularly when putting the phone back in a pocket. The 930 appears to have tougher, harder to press buttons in comparison.. We’ve grown weary of the ‘pixel’ wars of phone screens recently and the Lumia 830 is a good example of why. Yes, its 5-inch 1,280 x 720 screen has ‘only’ 296 pixels per inch (ppi) compared to the 441ppi of the Lumia 930’s Full HD OLED screen, but it’s still a damn good screen.. It’s not OLED like the Lumia 930 or the Lumia 735, so it lacks their ultra deep blacks, but it’s decently sharp and colours are accurate. You’ll notice a little edginess to text if you look very close, but from a normal viewing distance it’s not a problem. It’s certainly sharper than the screen in the Lumia 735, where the PenTile OLED screen gives it a grainy quality.. We didn’t have any serious problems using the Lumia 830 outdoors, either. It’s an impressively bright screen and it’s very good at picking the right brightness level for the conditions.. Overall, it’s a very good screen. You will find better on some similar price or cheaper phones, the Nexus 5, LG G2 and LG G3 spring to mind, but it’s certainly not a reason to rule out the Lumia 830..

Its a very solid phone and showcases Windows 8 very well. By Corey Hardin | 2 Apr 2015. I upgraded from a 520 which I actually did really like after my kids destroyed my S3. At first I was a little miffed about the app selection, but its getting better. So, when it came time to upgrade I went with the 830. It is a very well designed phone. The screen is bright and sharp and this is a little odd but I Iove the feel of the screen. The construction is also very good, its a solid phone, the only knock I have on it is the back cover is terribly flimsy and sometimes hard to snap in. The overall performance of the phone is very snappy. Windows 8 (Denim Update) runs like silk and apps open quickly. Was this review helpful?

Nokia Lumia 830 specification User opinions and reviews Review comments (72). 5" ClearBlack IPS display of 720p resolution, Gorilla Glass 3. 1.2 GHz quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU, Adreno 305 GPU, Snapdragon 400 chipset, 1GB of RAM. Windows Phone 8.1 OS Update 1 with Lumia Denim. 10MP PureView camera with 1080p@30fps video recording, Carl Zeiss optics, optical image stabilization. 0.9MP front-facing camera with 720p video recording. 16GB of inbuilt storage, microSD card slot up to 128GB. Free offline lifetime voice-guided navigation worldwide with Drive+. Snapdragon 400 chipset is somewhat dated now. No headset included in the box (neither in Europe, nor in the US). Nokia Lumia 830 is probably the last smartphone to wear the iconic Nokia logo, five letters with so much history behind. And while it might not be a model as iconic as the original 808 PureView or the Lumia 1020, the Nokia Lumia 830 is destined to go down in history as the end of an era. But let's not write it off just yet, the Lumia 830 is still in the beginning of its journey.. Riding the current wave of smartphones with thin metal frames, this colorful baby comes up with a vivid screen, a PureView camera and a snappy chipset behind an even snappier Windows Phone.. Microsoft has put some serious thought when designing the new Nokia Lumia 830 and you can tell this from the first glimpse - it's a gorgeously looking phone with solid build. The flagship-worthy design incorporates a metal frame, a 2.5D screen glass, exchangeable rear covers in various colors, an OIS-enabled rear camera highlighted with a black glass. The PureView sensor is a key selling point, of course, with 10MP resolution, ZEISS lens and optical image stabilization.. But there is more - the Lumia 830 is up to date with wireless charging support out of the box, LTE connectivity, NFC, it even supports 128GB microSD memory cards. Nokia Lumia 830 is among the first devices to run natively on the Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 OS with the latest Lumia Denim enhancements. And don't forget this all-round package is mid-range price!. There is very little the Nokia Lumia 830 got wrong. While the Snapdragon 400 chipset delivers a so-so performance on Android smartphones, we already know the lightweight Windows Phone will chug along happily on that sort of hardware. But we'll get into that in a bit.. But let's not make the Lumia 830 wait any longer. It's time get it through our traditional hands-on treatment and proceed with the hardware checkup shortly after..

Somewhere between the budget Lumia 735 and the flagship Lumia 930 , you'll find the Lumia 830. Not quite a flagship, the Lumia 830 aims at the higher end of the middle market, competing against the Galaxy S5 Mini and HTC One Mini 2 on contract with prices on EE hitting £33.99pm to get the Lumia 830 for free with 4GB of double speed 4G and free EU roaming.. Alternatively, you can also get it for £19.99 with no extras and a £59.99 upfront fee. In the US, it's available for $99.99 with an AT&T plan. If you're looking for more freedom, the Lumia 830 can found for £280.99 on PAYG or £304.99 SIM free. In the US, you can buy it for US$449.99 without a service plan, while in Australia you can pick it up for AU$535 at JB HiFi.. What does this actually get you though? The Lumia 830 has a metal body and a 5-inch, 294ppi, 720p HD screen. Under the skin, there's a quad-core Snapdragon 400 CPU clocked at 1.2GHz backed with 1GB RAM to run Windows Phone 8.1 , and it also includes a 10MP PureView camera with Carl Zeiss lenses.. A conspicuously square appearance means the 830 doesn't get that premium feel. Metal handsets are often commended for their premium feel - a perception driven by the iPhone range and the HTC One M8 , But I think that the metal frame is actually detrimental to the Lumia 830.. This is in part because of the plastic back, which detracts from the overall feel, and partly because of the shape. While the HTC One M8 comes with a beautifully ergonomic curved back, and the iPhone 6 is nicely rounded, the Lumia 830 just feels like a metal brick.. The chassis comes in two colours. The silver version is the less attractive: the contrast with the black face exaggerates the overall squareness of the handset. The black version has a more elegant look.. Couple the hard lines with the larger 139.4 x 70.7 x 8.5mm frame and you're left with a phone that sits uncomfortably in the hand. It also feels a little heavy at 150g. Despite the metal build, I would not feel overly confident about the chances of a phone this hefty surviving a drop.. Removing the plastic back panel reveals how flimsy it feels. The plastic back plate of the 830 makes it slightly grippier, but comes with its own faults. Being exceptionally thin means that it feels borderline flimsy, especially when I removed it to pop in the SIM. And that's before I get to the colours.. The Lumia 830 comes in four colours: a silver frame with white, orange or green back, and a black frame with black back. My review model was silver and orange, and I'm not a fan. Bright shades are a hallmark of the Lumia range - but whereas the 735 is enveloped in fun and outrageous colours, the orange and green plates on the 830 simply seem unnecessarily garish.. The Lumia 830 has soft back, Windows and search keys below the screen (so there are no on-screen navigation buttons) as well as the traditional hard volume rocker and power/lock key. There is a dedicated shutter key located with the other hard buttons on the right hand edge, which can be used to launch directly into the camera app.. Whatever the design rationale for putting the power port at the top, it's hard to use. On the top edge, you'll find the standard 3.5mm headphone jack, and microUSB port for charging and connecting to a PC. This is perfect for the headphone port, as it means you can slip the Lumia 830 into your pocket while listening to music. However, it's a different story for charging.. There must be a good internal design reason why the microUSB port is on the top, but it makes it awkward to use the Lumia 830 when it's connected to the wall. However, a strong battery performance means this is unlikely to be an issue. With normal usage, you'll only have to charge it at the end of the day.. And with so much to criticise about the look of the Lumia 830, it will need to be a phone of substance over style to succeed. How does it fare? Read on to find out.. Next Page Key features.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Daniel P.. T-Mobile - T-Mobile + AT&T - AT&T + Verizon - Verizon + Nokia - Nokia + Windows - Windows +. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction The Lumia 830 is Nokia's last midrange effort before its entire smartphone business was gobbled up, and rebranded as Microsoft Lumia. Nevertheless, the handset will be updated to the unifying Windows 10 when it lands later this year, so it is far from irrelevant still. Lumia 830 is hardly a spec'd out device when it comes to the main mobile components, as it features a lowly Snapdragon 400 chipset, 1 GB of RAM, and a 720p display “only,” but Nokia has thrown in a couple of perks that set it apart not only in the Windows Phone crowd, but also from mainstream Androids. Can a 10 MP optically-stabilized camera, and Nokia's Rich Recording with surround sound audio be enough to prevent the Lumia 830 from sinking into oblivion before Windows 10 hits? Let's see... In the box Nokia AC-60 1.5A wall charger Nokia Charging and Data Cable Warranty and information leaflets Design One of the thinnest Lumias available, the colorful polycarbonate 830 feels solid in the hand, eschewing the traditional unibody with a replaceable battery design this time. At first brush, the Lumia 830 is the typical Lumia Nokia's been churning out since the brand's inception, with a polycarbonate chassis that is available in numerous flashy colors. Here, however, we don't have the traditional unibody design, but rather an easy to pry off rear cover that reveals a swappable battery pack, as well as the nano SIM and micro SD card slots. We have to take points off for the nano SIM, however, as it will force you to cut or replace your micro SIM card if you buy it unlocked, but this trend is inevitable, it seems. At 5.49 x 2.78 x 0.33 inches (139.4 x 70.7 x 8.5 mm), however, and weighing 5.29 oz (150 g), it is somewhat tall and heavy for a 5-incher, and yet it utilizes a nano SIM slot, which should be reserved for slim and light design efforts. Moving on, the Lumia 830's chassis feels very solid in the hand, the matte polycarbonate on the back prevents it from slipping, and the keys concentrated on the right-hand side, are all big enough, with good tactile feedback, and easy to find and press without looking. We also liked how the tapered cover glass slopes towards the sides to merge with the side rim for one uninterrupted look and feel. Nokia bragged that it takes hundreds of robotic movements to achieve the curved glass edges, and we have to say that the results of all that scrubbing are very pleasant to hold or simply look at. Overall, the Lumia 830 feels like one very solid piece of hardware that should serve you well a long time. Display While an HD resolution is nothing to write home about in this day and age, Nokia has put a good IPS LCD panel in the 830, with plenty of color modes and manual adjustments to choose from. Lumia 830 sports a 5” 720x1080 pixels IPS LCD display with decent 294ppi pixel density. You have several display modes to choose from, like cool, vivid and advanced, with the latter letting you play around with color temperature, tint and saturation sliders, until you've reached the desired results. Color saturation can be adjusted from “natural”, all the way to the gaudy “vivid” level. Color temperature goes from warm through neutral to cold, while the tint slider lets you emphasize individual colors – from green to purple. The color accuracy of the screen in the default mode is excellent, too. Lumia 830 returned 6558 Kelvin white point in our display measurements, which means that the hues are neither too cold nor too warm, but rather cover almost perfectly the reference 6500K mark. Scoring another good point, the color distribution chart returns accurate representation, with no oversaturation or off-kilter tonalities. Nokia cites “sunlight readability enhancements” for the Lumia 830, which consist of boosting the display brightness significantly when outdoors under direct sunlight, but doesn't list it as having the Clear Black filter on top that diminishes reflectivity. Thus, while the 830 fares well outdoors, it's contrast is not as good then as the one on the Lumia 930, for instance, so you'd have slightly subpar experience reading the screen under the bright sunlight, compared with the flagship. Still, at 478 nits, the phone's display is bright enough to be used comfortably outdoors. Covered by sculpted Gorilla Glass 3, the Nokia Lumia 830 screen should withstand more than a few bumps and scratches, and, as usual, it also features a supersensitive touch layer, meaning that you can operate it with your gloves on.. 5.49 x 2.78 x 0.33 inches. 139.4 x 70.7 x 8.5 mm. 5.57 x 2.78 x 0.43 inches. 141.5 x 70.7 x 11 mm. 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 inches. 138.5 x 70.9 x 8.9 mm. 5.39 x 2.8 x 0.39 inches. 137 x 71 x 9.8 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

The LG G2 right now is on sale for $200 off contract and it came out a year and a half, but it is still superior to the Lumia 830. The G2 has a 1920x1080 IPS display, a quad core Snapdragon 800 CPU running at 2.3 GHz, 2 GB of ram, 13mp camera, 32 GB of storage. The Lumia 830 has a 1280x720 display, quad core Snapdragon 400 CPU running at 1.2 GHz, 1 GB of ram, 10mp camera, 8 GB of storage. I would spend my money on the older but more capable G2. Also the Moto G 2014 has the same display size and resolution to the Lumia 830, including the same ram and CPU. The moto G off contract is $179, where as the Lumia 830 is around $400 off contract. My money would still be on the Moto G because I could buy 2 off contract with a good meal out on the town for the price of 1 Lumia 830.. (Posts: 5192; Member since: 28 Oct 2013). posted on 30 Jan 2015, 17:23. I exchange way to many G2's to consider them as a serious phone to use. I would argue for the G3 however. Guess I am missing the sale of the G2, on tmobile without contract i am paying 330 at ATT i am paying 478. I would hands down choose a 830 over the G2, not only from personal use from test phones at work, but the camera despite 10mp was for me the better snapper. Plus as everyone here loves to use sd support, it has it at 128gb at that. As well in anand's review the 830 held rather well against the g2 and the motox..

Moto G is also almost as good as this (except camera), yet much cheaper. (Posts: 638; Member since: 19 Aug 2013). posted on 28 Jan 2015, 10:15.

The nano SIM is enough to keep me from buying any Microsoft phone. I like to be able to switch phones. I really do not understand why phones keep getting bigger but SIM cards are trending smaller?. (Posts: 281; Member since: 10 Apr 2013). posted on 28 Jan 2015, 11:17. Nano SIMs will be standard in a year or so. The reason is obvious: Why make a SIM bigger than it needs to be? A smaller SIM means a smaller SIM holder and more room in the phone for other things.. (Posts: 729; Member since: 30 May 2011). posted on 28 Jan 2015, 11:40. When everybody uses nano SIM switching phones will not be as big of a problem. But right now it is one of the major things that stopped me from buying a 1520. I bought a Sony Xperia Z Ultra instead. And there is a limit to how small an item humans can easily handle with their fingers. For me the current SIM is already there..

Gotta be honest, I don't think the score really represents actual device usage. I had the chance to use one for almost a week and the 830 is an absolute joy to use. It feels great in the hand, looks nice, is very zippy to use, lasts welllll over a day on a charge and take really nice photos. Specs are nice and all, but I feel like reviews like this take away from how people actually use their device..

MS can play this game long way, they still receive money from android phones. (Posts: 62; Member since: 12 Aug 2014). posted on 28 Jan 2015, 16:25. I should add this Lumia is A better phone than Moto G 2014. It's not just a better camera, it has better build quality, a better design with a metallic frame, it has a smaller footprint, wireless charging, a better calibrated display with much better picture quality, NFC and LTE (which is missing in you beloved G 2014). The fact that you just overlook these facts and then say they're equal or comparable just because they got the same SoC and RAM. I agree the initial price (400USD) was nuts, but right now I think the Lumia 830 is well worth the 300USD it's selling for.. posted on 11 Feb 2015, 12:46.

Microsoft is now selling out it's stock of Nokia Lumia 520. smart phones at a super dirt CHEAP price. Microsoft going to start clearing out Nokia Lumia smart phones stock starting with the Lumia 520.

Was considering the 1520 and 930. 930 battery life not as good and does not have replaceable battery. 1520 would be my second choice in the future. This phone is a BIG step up from 920. Battery life - i am an extremely heavy user as this is my business phone and constantly on pone calls and the calendar. With 920 i would have to recharge the phone 4x a day to keep it above 40%. With the 830 i can go an entire day and still have 25% left. I am not totally sure why the battery life is so dramatically better. i have location and bluetooth on full time and the only setting i changed was to turn off 'vibrate'. so i am ecstatic with battery life!. Bluetooth, Wifi, Airplane on and off all work much faster and nearly instant. Size - ideal! great in the hand as it has a slim profile. i can manage all functions with one hand. Camera - a step up from 920 and much faster loading. Apps - all apps seem to run no problem especially heavy graphic games like Asphalt 8. no skipping and runs perfectly smooth for up to one hour in my testing. Easy to remove back cover for removable battery is a great feature and must have. LTE/4G is wicked fast! Tested against iPhone 6 and loaded pages faster! :-). Dropped in a 16 gb sd card. Love it, as you can choose to save whatever files to the card and or the phone. Skype - runs perfect on video calls. interestingly the speaker phone works better on Skype!. only negative is the speaker phone. so any back round noise gets picked up and callers complain its too loud. so you need a quiet area to talk. and listening volume if above 7 echos to the caller and starts to distort listening. Bluetooth headset or using in the car solves the problem if 50 mph or lower. Overall i give the phone a 9!. Want to comment? Please login or register ..

Windows 10 Mobile's official launch is set for December.. Among the many hardware announcements today, fans were also eagerly waiting news about Windows 10 Mobil ... e, and a likely release date. While Panos Panay and Terry Myserson disappointed users by not even bringing up the mobile OS, a Microsoft representative on Facebook has now confirmed that the official launch of Windows 10 Mobile is expected sometime in December.. In response to a query about when existing devices will be updated on one of the promo videos for the Microsoft Lumia 950 family, a Microsoft representative replied with the following:. Windows 10 is available on PCs and tablets now, and while Lumia 950 and Microsoft Lumia 950 XL ship with Windows 10 for phones, broad availability of Windows 10 on other devices, including mobile phones, will begin rolling out in December. As we can see, the Lumia 950 and 950 XL will ship with a finished version of Windows 10, while other existing devices will have to wait till December. The post does not, however, give a set date for when in December the rollout will take place.. This is slightly later than previous expectations, which indicated that the OS would be launched in November at the latest. For those of you who can't wait to get their hands on Windows 10 Mobile, the only option till December is the Insider Program.. Still, given the many complaints, and the relatively poor state of Insider builds currently, the added time should serve Microsoft well in pushing out a complete and polished operating system, something it desperately needs after the relatively lukewarm customer response to its mobile aspirations.. Nokia Lumia 830 shared a link .. · 6 October 2015 ·. The New Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL. The New Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL The New Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/MicrosoftLumia950Official https://www.faceb. Nokia Lumia 830 shared Microsoft Lumia 950 's photo .. · 6 August 2015 ·. Images of the Microsoft Lumia 950/940 or 950/940(XL) prototype revealed for the first time.. For weeks now we have been filling in the news regarding the Microso ... ft's Talkman and Cityman Lumia phones due later this fall. Possibly going by the names Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL these phones should represent the next-generation of high-end devices for the struggling mobile maker.. This morning, numerous photos of the Lumia 950 XL aka Cityman prototype have appeared online in the WPXAP forums.. Windows Central can confirm that these images are indeed real and recent.. The photos are of decent quality. However, the phone is only seen from a few angles. The main one, seen above, shows the 5.2-inch WQHD AMOLED display with a black body. As we have indicated earlier, these phones have a polycarbonate body.. The phone is also evidently in a protective case to help disguise it.. There is also a rear shot that reveals the 20 MP camera and triple LED flash (yellow and white) along with a USB Type-C port on the bottom. Also, as we have confirmed earlier, this phone and the Lumia 950 XL with a larger display both have on-screen keys and not physical capacitive ones. Presumably Microsoft chose this to keep the screen bezel smaller.. Talkman (Lumia 950) ---------------------------- Matte White or black polycarbonate body 5.2 inch WQHD (1440x2560) OLED display Snapdragon 808, 64-bit Hexa core Iris scanner (infrared) for Windows Hello 3GB of RAM 32GB of internal storage with a microSD card slot 20MP PureView rear camera 5MP Wide-angle front facing camera 3000 mAh removable battery Qi wireless charging with flip cover USB Type-C. Cityman (Lumia 950 XL) -------------------------------- Matte White or black polycarbonate body 5.7 inch WQHD (1440x2560) OLED display Snapdragon 810, 64-bit Octa core Iris scanner (infrared) for Windows Hello 3GB of RAM 32GB of internal storage with a microSD card slot 20MP PureView rear camera with triple LED flash Aluminum side buttons 5MP Wide-angle front facing camera 3300 mAh removable battery Qi wireless charging integrated USB Type-C. The phone is also running build 10240 of the Windows 10 Mobile OS, and it has an early build of Continuum for phone on board as well. Interestingly, the camera settings confirm that this phone can shoot 120 FPS in 720P HD, which is something many people have requested for some time.. Microsoft is expected to reveal more about Talkman and Cityman in an October event, likely in New York City. Along with these phones, the Surface Pro 4, Microsoft Band 2, and Windows 10 wave 2 are expected to be revealed as well.. Update: There is some debate whether this is the Lumia 950 (Talkman) or Lumia 950 XL (Cityman). We are trying to confirm which it is at this time, but besides some slight design differences (which would be hidden by the case) and the screen size, both phones are quite similar.. Update2 : We have been able to confirm that this case is actually more than that. It is meant to hide the final design of the phone and ID anyone who uses it publicly. It is meant to hide the real shape of the phone and prevent leaks about the final design, mainly the back part It cannot be removed from the engineering sample To track leakers, the case has identifying information including: shape of the case (number of stripes, space between stripes); upper/lower cases for letters: there is a sort of binary code: MicRoSoft MObIle, MICrosOfT mObILE, etc.; The phone is ugly with this 'special' case and the shape hurts your hand when you hold it.. All of these things about the case are meant to distract people from using the prototypes in public. This also means the owner of that phone is likely in a meeting right now and about to get fired.. · 29 April 2015 ·. # SHARE : # HUGE_NEWS : Windows 10 can run Android and iOS apps.

Microsoft Lumia : As we mentioned a little over a week ago, we recently broug ... ht the partition stitching feature up to our main branch and have been testing it extensively within Microsoft. I’m VERY HAPPY to be able to get a build out to you today that has this and allows Windows 10 to be used across a larger set of phones. This is definitely not the final list of devices, and we’re still hard at work to let people with other phones get hands-on with Windows 10 in the near future, including non-Lumia devices as well.. Today we are releasing Build 10051 of the Windows 10 Technical Preview for phones to the Fast ring. This build not only supports more phones, but also has tons of exciting new features that you’ll be able to try for the first time.. Devices supported with this build :. So, let’s start with the good news: a TON more devices are supported for this build, and we’re excited for Insiders with these devices to start using Windows 10 and sending us feedback.. Lumia 1020 Lumia 1320 Lumia 1520 Lumia 520 Lumia 525 Lumia 526 Lumia 530 Lumia 530 Dual Sim Lumia 535 Lumia 620 Lumia 625 Lumia 630 Lumia 630 Dual Sim Lumia 635 Lumia 636 Lumia 638 Lumia 720 Lumia 730 Lumia 730 Dual SIM Lumia 735 Lumia 810 Lumia 820 Lumia 822 Lumia 830 Lumia 920 Lumia 925 Lumia 928 Microsoft Lumia 430 Microsoft Lumia 435 Microsoft Lumia 435 Dual SIM Microsoft Lumia 435 Dual SIM DTV Microsoft Lumia 532 Microsoft Lumia 532 Dual SIM Microsoft Lumia 640 Dual SIM Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM. And now a bit of bad news : In our last post, I shared a preliminary list of phones we expected to support with this flight. You’ll see that the list has remained largely unchanged with one exception – the Lumia Icon. Unfortunately there is an issue with scaling on certain devices (930, Icon, and 640XL) which makes the UI too small to be usable, and we need to add code to support new scaling thresholds for these devices. That work is underway, so we expect to see support for them in the near future. We know some of you will be disappointed, but trust me that you want us to make that fix before we send it out to you.. Instructions on how to join the Windows Insider Program and get your phone set up are available on the Windows Insider website. Be sure to read the instructions very carefully so you can upgrade easily and comfortably.. If your phone is already on the Windows 10 Technical Preview, all you need to do is go to Settings apps > Update & recovery > Phone update > and check for updates. We’re pushing out this build only to the Fast ring today. If you’d like to change from the Fast ring to the Slow ring, just go into the Windows Insider app on your phone and login with your MSA and change rings.. Project Spartan: An early version of Project Spartan is available in this flight. It uses our new rendering engine to give greater interoperability with the modern mobile web, and includes early versions of Reading View and Reading List. For now, Project Spartan is not the default browser, and exists side-by-side with IE11. You can find it in the All Apps list and pin it to your Start Screen from there. Please send feedback on sites and design. For more details on Project Spartan on the phone.. New mail and calendar apps : Outlook Mail and Outlook Calendar are the new built-in mail and calendar universal apps for Windows 10. These new apps bring a fresh UI, with a toggle to freely move between your email and calendar without returning to the Start screen. Outlook Mail includes customizable Swipe Gestures, letting you swipe right or left to take actions like delete, flag, move or mark as read/unread. Also check out the new email authoring experience. Outlook Mail leverages the familiar capabilities of Word to create a richer email experience. You can do formatting tricks like inserting tables, adding pictures and using bullets and text. Outlook Mail and Outlook Calendar connects to Office 365, Exchange, Outlook.com , Gmail, Google Calendar, Yahoo!, IMAP, POP and other popular accounts.. Please note that to add or remove accounts in Outlook Mail and Outlook Calendar, you do so within these apps. The Email + accounts page has been removed from the Settings app.. New Phone and Messaging apps: You’ll see our new Phone and Messaging apps in this build. Give them a try and let us know what you think. The Messaging app has a new visual design. You can also easily upgrade from a messaging conversation to a voice call with one click of the phone icon in the new app bar.. Note: If you are updating a phone from Build 9941 – please see below for a known issue regarding MMS that will require you to go use the Windows Phone Recovery Tool to roll back to Windows Phone 8.1 first and upgrade to this build in order to have MMS working on your phone.. New People app: The new universal People app has a new visual design but will continue to be the comprehensive list of all your contacts across the services you care about such as Exchange, Outlook.com , Gmail, Facebook, etc. You’ll be able to easily manage all your contacts and quickly connect with them.. New Maps app: The first preview of our new universal Maps app on phone is now available. Maps offers you the features and tools you need to explore and navigate the world. This includes the best maps, aerial imagery, rich local search data, and voice guided navigation experiences from both Bing Maps and HERE maps, integrated together for the first time into a single app for Windows.. Updated App Switcher: Check out the updated app switcher by pressing and holding the back button on your phone to see your recently used apps. We’ve added support for landscape when invoked from an app being viewed in landscape. For large phones like the Lumia 1520, we’ve introduced a new grid layout so you can be more efficient at switching between apps. And we’ve extended the length of recently used apps to 15.. We’ve updated the keyboard layout based on your feedback. The keyboard layout now has period, comma and emoji keys on first page of keyboard. Language switching is enabled by press-and-hold on the &123 key. There is also an option to replace the emoji key with the language switching key.. We’ve fixed the Cortana icon resolution so it now scales with tile size. We’ve fixed the issue where the Photos app would fail to launch periodically when attempting to add a photo attachment to an email, OneNote or Facebook item.. We’ve fixed the issue where the Microsoft Band wouldn’t sync with your phone after upgrading to Windows 10. The Photos app’s tile will now pick up the phone’s theme color before it’s launched and then start showing pictures from your collection including OneDrive in the Live tile.. Here are some known issues :. This is preproduction software going out to the Fast ring – so you should expect to see some bugs. The list below are some of the ones that we thought you should know about up front, and it’s worth reading carefully. We’re working to fix all of these in future builds.. There might be situations in which auto-upload of your Camera Roll to OneDrive may not be working. Please be sure to back up your photos especially if you need to use the Windows Phone Recovery Tool to go back to Windows Phone 8.1.. The Office Hub has been removed from this build. You won’t be able to open Word, Excel, PowerPoint or OneNote files in this build. Preview versions of the universal Office apps will be available in the coming weeks. All Bluetooth-based interactions with Cortana are not working in this build because we’re reworking how Cortana interacts with Bluetooth. This includes dictating and reading text messages, initiating searches and chit-chat, and all system-level control (such as playing music, launching applications, or navigating settings.. After upgrade, some apps that have been installed onto a SD memory card will fail to launch. To fix this, uninstall and reinstall the apps. About 1% of the time, incoming phone calls may not play a ringing sound. Call + SMS filtering will not work after upgrade.. For people upgrading their phone from Build 9941, there is a bug in which your phone’s MMS settings will be lost after upgrade. The new Messaging app doesn’t yet have the ability to re-enter these settings. You will need to use the Windows Phone Recovery Tool to go back to Windows Phone 8.1 and then upgrade to this build to get MMS working again.. Also for people upgrading their phone from Build 9941, the tiles on your Start screen for the Camera and Photos apps may be missing or corrupt. You will have to unpin any corrupt tiles and re-pin the apps to your Start screen.. On some phones, due to a scaling bug the dismiss button won’t be visible when an alarm is triggered. To stop your phone from “alarming “just touch the arrow and swipe up on the notification and off the screen to end the alarm.. On phones with 512MB of memory, apps can randomly crash due to an issue with memory management.. You may need to re-pin the Phone app after upgrade.. The Insider Hub is now included on Phone but may fail to launch on some phones.. I’m very excited to get this build out to all of the eager Windows Insiders who have been waiting since our first preview build to try Windows 10 on their devices. We are still very much in the thick of development and this build still has some rough edges, but there is also a lot to be excited about here as well..

How to roll back from Windows 10 Preview to Windows Phone 8.1. It has been a week since Windows 10 Preview for phone was released and you've probably realized th ... at it is far from being finished. While you had fun checking out the Preview, you want to go back to a more stable build. If you want to roll back to Windows Phone 8.1, Microsoft has made it really simple. You'll need a computer, your phone, a USB cable, and the Windows Phone Recovery Tool. Watch our step-by-step instructions on video.. If possible, make sure that your computer and phone are charged. Are you ready? Continue reading for the next steps.. Download and install the Windows Phone Recovery Tool to your computer. Open the Windows Phone Recovery Tool and connect the phone to your computer with the USB cable. If your phone is not automatically detected, disconnect it from your computer and press 'My phone was not detected' at the bottom and follow the instructions on the screen.. If the phone is detected, tap the phone model on the screen to continue.. The next screen shows software versions. Tap the reinstall button at the bottom. There's a disclaimer that suggests to backup your phone. The recovery tool downloads and installs the firmware. This may take a while depending on your network connection. The installation files are about 1.7 GB. Make sure not to disconnect the cable.. If all goes well, you get a message that says, "Operation successfully completed.". That's it! You should now be back on Windows Phone 8.1. We'll let you know if a new build for Windows 10 Preview for phone shows up..

Windows Phone Users usually reset their phone using the hardware button / by going to the About section in the s ... But both of these require several steps to be followed.. But this new way just asks you to enter a number in the Dialer to reset your phone.. To reset you just NEED TO type this in the Dialer : ##777#. As soon as you enter the number, a pop up will appear asking you to either reset/cancel.. This way of reset won't delete your Downloaded Maps or the Network Settings. So, this is actually a type of Factory Reset which would change the settings back to as they were when the phone was first booted.

WhatsApp launches a web client for Chrome and Android.. WhatsApp is coming to the desktop, ... thanks to a web client that launched today for Chrome and Android. Reached by The Verge, WhatsApp confirmed earlier rumors, which pointed to a newly live page at web.whatsapp.com. "The primary use is of course still on your phone," a spokesman said, "but there are people who spend time in front of a computer at home or at work and this will help bridge the two.". Your phone will need to stay connected to the web for the client to work, and all user messages will still reside on the phone, but WhatsApp is hoping the client will give users more flexibility. A spokesman said the company plans to bring the same experience to iOS, although the timeframe is still unclear. Detailing the features in a subsequent blog post, the company said, "we really hope you find web client useful in your everyday lives.". With more than 600 million users, WhatsApp is one of the largest chat clients in the world, and the app's growth has fueled rumors concerning the company's next move. In November, WhatsApp partnered with Whisper Systems for end-to-end encryption, bringing strong security to an unusually broad user base. In December, the company's plans for voice-calling were revealed by images scraped from WhatsApp's public site, although the company has yet to publicly release the feature..

LG recalls 30,000 830 Spyder handsets for crappy 911 connections. Lumia 830 review: bringing the Icon down to the mid-range. When Nokia released the Lumia Icon earlier this year, it took its polycarbonate design philosophy and went a bit metal -- aluminum, specifically. The result was a premium phone with a fancy body to match. But the Icon's exclusivity on Verizon limited its appeal, and its sibling, the Lumia 930 , has yet to make it to US shores. Into that void comes the Lumia 830, from the freshly minted Microsoft Mobile .. With the Lumia 830, priced at $100 with a two-year contract on AT&T ($450 contract-free), Microsoft looks to bring the metal frame and PureView camera branding of high-end Lumias down to the mid-range smartphone level. Of course, there's always the risk of making the wrong sacrifices when trying to lower the price, so did Microsoft shave too many corners off of the 830's aluminum body? I've spent the past week with the global version of the phone as my daily driver to find out.. Gallery: Lumia 830 review | 19 Photos. Quirky white balance (though pending updates may improve things). The Lumia 830 strikes a good balance with its premium aluminum frame and mid-range internals. Those looking for a solid camera experience at this price range should take a good look.. Hardware Software Camera Performance and battery life Nokia Lumia 830 Nokia Lumia Icon Nokia Lumia 735 WPBench 252 471 245 SunSpider 1.0.2 (MS)* 1,235 538 1,237 AnTuTu 12,154 25,750 12,060 "SunSpider: Lower scores are better. While the lower-tier Lumia 735/730 handsets stick to tried-and-true polycarbonate bodies, the Lumia 830 follows in the aluminum-ringed footsteps of the Icon and 930. A solid frame of metal surrounds the 830's squared-off body, interrupted by two pairs of thin plastic strips on the top and bottom edges (for the radio frequencies to pass through). At 139.4 x 70.7 x 8.5mm, it checks in at 2.4mm taller, 0.3mm narrower and 1.3mm thinner than its higher-end predecessors. Its 150g weight puts it 17 grams lighter as well.. That metal frame is flanked on the front by a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 that rises slightly above the aluminum body. Thankfully, the display gently tapers at the edges, making for a smooth transition from the glass to the thin metal along the bezels. Around back, a removable plastic cover allows access to the swappable battery as well as the nano-SIM and microSD slots. The latter of which supports up to 128GB cards to supplement the 16GB of onboard memory. (Sorry, no 32GB or higher model here.) The backplate puffs out even further from the aluminum frame than the front display, creating a curved rear that makes the phone actually quite comfortable in my palm despite the flat-sided aluminum frame. Its matte finish feels nice to the touch, while also resisting greasy fingerprints. If you're not a fan of my review unit's orange hue, there other colors to consider -- though the selection in the US may differ from what's offered elsewhere. Microsoft is also offering various colorful flip cover shells (with wireless charging support) if you'd like some extra protection.. As for ports and buttons, the Lumia 830 mostly sticks to the standard set seen on many a Lumia over the years. On the right edge, you'll find a volume rocker near the top, a power key in the middle and a dedicated camera key toward the bottom. The headphone jack sits front and center along the top edge. I was somewhat surprised to find the micro-USB port up there as well (it's been on the bottom on most of my past phones). In regular use, I found that placement a bit tricky when I had the 830 mounted in a cradle in my car -- it was a bit odd to see a charging cable sprouting upward out of my phone. That said, there's always the built-in, Qi-compatible wireless charging if you find the charge port's location troublesome.. The most notable feature on the rear, of course, is the Lumia 830's PureView camera module, located in the top-center of the backplate. Here, Microsoft Mobile mimics the look of the Lumia 1020 's signature camera, with a black, circular panel surrounding the 830's 10-megapixel camera and LED flash. Of course, this is more "inspiration" than it is direct "imitation." You won't find the 1020's massive, Ritz cracker-size main shooter protruding from the back. No, we're dealing with more modest equipment here, so the disc on the 830's rear is much smaller than its ancestor's. What's more, the removable cover adds a slight ridge around the rear camera, providing a bit of protection.. Toward the bottom of the back panel is the 830's main speaker grille. While that location might not be as ideal as, say, the 1020's bottom-edge speaker, it's placed where the rear starts to taper, giving it a bit of breathing room when the phone is placed face-up on a table.. While the 830 matches the 5-inch screen size of the Icon/930 line, Microsoft shed some pixels (and helped lower the price) by opting for a 1,280 x 720 display instead of a 1080p panel. We're also dealing with an IPS LCD here, rather than the AMOLED unit found on its older siblings. Whether that's a plus or a minus likely depends on how much you enjoy/detest AMOLED's highly saturated colors. I find the 830's screen pleasing for the most part, with accurate colors and good viewing angles in most directions. However, I did notice washed-out colors while watching movies at extreme positions, especially toward the lower left and right in landscape mode.. Recent improvements to the Windows Phone OS have more or less put Microsoft's mobile offering on an even footing (as far as core features) with the likes of Android and iOS. The latest upgrades to WP8.1 include support for folders on the home screen, more options and languages for the Cortana voice assistant and faster browsing through Internet Explorer. In addition, Lumia models will be getting an update called " Denim ," which tacks on camera improvements, more options for the Glance Screen feature and voice activation on certain Lumia models (the Icon, the 930 and the 1520) -- just say, "Hey, Cortana" to fire up the voice assistant while the phone's idle. On top of those additions, the OS also boasts a solid notification center, home screen wallpapers and swiping support in the keyboard.. The Lumia's Glance Screen, which offers the time, date and some notifications when the display is off, makes the 830 a perfect bedside alarm clock since it stays onscreen while the phone is charging. No more groggily trying to find your phone's power toggle in the middle of the night just to see how much time you got left to sleep.. Out of the box, my unlocked review unit came with the standard Lumia offerings (including Here Drive, Skype and Mix Radio), as well as a smattering of third-party apps like Facebook and Flipboard. Thankfully, if you're not interested in any of the preloaded options, they're easy enough to uninstall to reclaim some storage space.. Of course, it's not all great news. The continued additions to the OS (plus other, Lumia-specific features) have resulted in an unorganized and ungainly settings menu. The latest incarnation of WP's stock music player has you flicking upward on the album art to change tracks. After years of swiping right to left (since back in the Zune HD days), I'm finding this new gesture annoying and less intuitive. And then there's the app question. While the situation has greatly improved of late, there's still a chance your favorite app or game may not yet be offered on the platform.. Beyond that, Google still refuses to offer official options for services like Gmail, Hangouts and YouTube. So if you're deeply integrated in Google's ecosystem, but prefer the feel of Windows Phone, you'll need to resort to third-party options like IM+ for Hangouts or Metrotube for YouTube. Of course, Microsoft offers its own suite of tools, like Office, OneNote and OneDrive, that play quite nicely with Windows Phone 8.1.. You may consider alternative apps even when official support exists. Case in point: While there is a beta-tagged version of Instagram available, it lacks several editing tools seen on Android and iOS. Meanwhile, the third-party app 6tag offers some interesting options, like collages and letterboxing photos with wide aspect ratios to fit them in Instagram's square format.. Whether that app deficit actually affects you depends, of course, on your specific needs. Can you get by without dedicated Gmail or YouTube apps? Will you be satisfied with an official Instagram app that's not yet as robust as its Android/iOS counterparts? Comfortable with resorting to third-party alternatives? I can't answer that for you, unfortunately. So if you are considering Windows Phone, be sure to check the app marketplace to know what you're getting yourself into.. With the Lumia 830, Microsoft isn't bringing just the design language of the Icon and 930 down to a lower price bracket. It's also placing the "PureView" badge on a more affordable option as well. Sure, the 830 doesn't boast the resolution of the 20MP Icon or 930, much less the Lumia 1020's 41 megapixels. Instead, it stakes its claim to the PureView name via optical image stabilization and the promise of improved responsiveness.. Before I dive into the details, though, it's worth stating that my review unit didn't arrive with the Lumia Denim update. So, I was unable to test that firmware's biggest additions, including much-improved overall speed, a Lumia Camera app that replaces Nokia Camera and a capture mode that lets you merge the results of flash and non-flash versions of the same shot, letting you set a balanced look for the final image. I'll be sure to update my thoughts once I spend some quality time with the new features.. Even without those Denim improvements, I enjoyed my time taking photos with the 830's 10MP main shooter. On a daytime stroll through downtown Tacoma, Washington, the phone capably handled any shot I attempted. White balance in good light was accurate, though it occasionally took a few seconds to settle on the right color temperature. It did tend toward cooler (bluer) temps in low-light situations, though the Nokia Camera app's manual options let me fix that quickly.. Interestingly, the 830 also preferred bluish white balance when I tried to take orange-heavy photos of autumn leaves or pumpkin patches. For what it's worth, images of the same fall leaves taken with an iPhone 6 produced much more accurate colors, but that's admittedly competing in a completely different price bracket.. Quirky white balance aside, the camera's optical image stabilization let me take some solid photos in low-light environments, both indoors and out. Close-up shots of sushi in a dark restaurant and portraits of fellow passengers on a bumpy car ride produced relatively clean photos, though if your jitteriness is simply out of control, the 830 won't produce miracles.. Image quality starts declining when the light gets seriously low. A few interior shots of a dark, empty chapel showed a significant amount of noise, a loss of detail and muted colors, but not quite what I'd label as "unusable." Of course, what's unacceptable for a huge wall print isn't the same as what's unacceptable for an Instagram post. By that I mean, if you keep your expectations in check (e.g., using a mid-range phone for social network-worthy photos), you should be fine with the results in most settings.. The rear shooter's stabilization also applies to video recording (up to 1080p/30). Quality in good light is nice and sharp, though it tends to struggle in darker settings. It also takes slightly longer to adjust to different lighting levels than an iPhone 6. On the plus side, that stabilization feature does a respectable job smoothing out video, especially when you're on the move. We're not talking pocket Steadicam here, of course, but back-to-back videos of me jogging around with an iPhone 6 and the 830 resulted in steadier footage on the Lumia.. Unlike the selfie-targeting 5MP front shooter on the lower-tier Lumia 735/730 , the 0.9MP unit we have here is strictly average. It's fine for quick snaps and Skype, but not much else. Fortunately, the available Lumia Selfie app lets you use the rear shooter for self-portraits (an audio cue signals when your face is in the frame).. For the most part, the Lumia 830 does the PureView name proud. It doesn't have the megapixel count of the 1020 or the Icon/930, so you'll have less leeway when it comes to cropping. But it's a mid-tier camera I would be happy to use on a daily basis. The auto white balance could be more reliable and the LED flash is simply average, but these are minor flies in a largely effective ointment. If the Denim update only improves things, I'll have even less to complain about at this price level.. For high-resolution photo samples from the Lumia 830, click here .. The quad-core 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 and 1GB of RAM powering the Lumia 830 may be decidedly mid-range, but its general performance doesn't leave too much to be desired. Apps launch and close swiftly, and general navigation around the Windows Phone 8.1 UI is fluid and stutter-free. Browsing mobile web pages was a pleasant experience, though there was a good bit of tiling when zooming in and out of desktop sites. If you prefer hard numbers to gut feelings, have a look at the benchmarks below.. In general, we're talking about a solid performer here. Push the phone hard enough, though, and you can see the limits of its mid-level hardware. In a fast-moving, 3D game like Asphalt 8 , the Lumia 830 turns in merely adequate, and definitely not silky-smooth, frame rates. And if the game's graphics don't clue you in, the frequent audio breakup during races should be a clear sign this isn't going to be a mobile-gaming powerhouse.. Other games can give the 830 a workout as well. While endless runner Temple Run 2 stays smooth most of the time, certain turns, especially during water slide areas, cause things to slow down a bit. It's not just fast-moving 3D games, either. Strangely, frame rates in the relatively simple Jetpack Joyride dip noticeably whenever you hit a large patch of coins. You'd think that would make the frantic game easier, but it's really a bit jarring.. On the bright side, the Lumia 830 offers solid battery life with its removable 2,200mAh cell. In our standard video-rundown test, where we loop an HD video while email, Facebook and Twitter run in the background, the 830 managed 10 hours and 39 minutes before calling it quits. That's actually a bit longer than the 10 hours Microsoft estimates for video playback. In real-world use, the phone regularly saw me through full workdays filled with emails, social networking, lunchtime Instagrams, gaming and even a few actual phone calls.. Speaking of, voice calls featured clear conversations on both ends and the speakerphone performed admirably in my car. Even with the phone face-up on a table, the curved back allows enough clearance for sound to be heard without being muddled. That rear-facing speaker puts out voice and music at a decent level, though don't expect much, if any, bass to shine through. Overall, if mobile gaming is important to you, it may be worth investing in a phone with a bit more oomph to tackle current and future games. If you're mainly using your smartphone for more... serious pursuits, the Lumia 830 should handle those needs without breaking much of a sweat.. Since AT&T hasn't yet announced a US release date or price for the Lumia 830, it's a little tricky to size up how it'll fare against the competition here. AT&T recently announced US pricing and availability info for the Lumia 830. 7th, you can snag an 830 on a two-year contract for $100, while contract-free pricing comes in at $450. The carrier's also offering a free Fitbit Flex if you're among the first to sign up. That pricing puts it in the company of last year's Apple flagship, the iPhone 5s , among others. Despite its age, the 5s will offer faster performance, especially on games -- if that's important to you. Its camera chops shouldn't be ignored either, though between the two, I'd probably prefer the 830's rear shooter thanks in part to the OIS and that hardware shutter key. Mobile OS preferences aside, it seems worth noting that while both offer 16GB of storage, the 830 backs that up with microSD support.. Speaking of year-old flagships, $100 on a two-year AT&T contract could also get you an LG G2. While we were impressed with its 5.2-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 display and overall performance last year, its camera didn't draw universal praise. As for more recent entries at this price, you might also consider the second-gen Moto X. We were smitten with its near-stock Android build and customizable design, but were a bit frustrated at times with its rear camera.. The 830 is also available elsewhere and in the UK, for example, EE is offering it on pay-as-you-go for £280 (about $450). Meanwhile, Amazon is offering an unlocked international version for around the same price. On EE, that puts it in roughly the same bracket as the 8GB iPhone 5c and the Ascend P7 (both listed at £300). I'd be quick to dismiss the 5c, as it offers less onboard storage (and no microSD slot) and what's essentially two-year-old hardware. The P7, on the other hand, represents a solid competitor at this price range. You won't get the Lumia's full-featured camera app, but it does boast a 1080p display and an 8MP front-facing camera.. If you can do without the 830's solid, aluminum chassis and stabilized camera, take a look at its lower-priced sibling, the Lumia 735 (around €219, or about $279). It offers the same Snapdragon 400 heart in a polycarbonate body, with a much better 5MP selfie camera on the front. Although, if you're looking in that lower price bracket, don't forget the Moto G ($180), which also features similar quad-core internals, along with official support for Google's ecosystem.. In the end, the Lumia 830 is clearly a "bridge" device. It's got the high-end looks and capable camera of flagship-level phones, along with the performance and display resolution of mid-range and budget models. Whether Microsoft Mobile made the right trade-offs really depends on what you want out of your smartphone. Does having a solid camera (that's due to get even better) trump average gaming performance? Does using an ever-improving voice assistant mean more to you than having official support for Google's ecosystem? Personally, I can live with most of the sacrifices that have been made. I don't think I'm missing much with the 720p screen and merely average front-facing camera. But the spotty performance in games and Microsoft's continuing struggle to land the latest and best apps give me pause.. If you're in need of an anecdote, here's one: After more than a year of happily using the 41MP Lumia 1020 as my daily driver, I made the switch to the iPhone 6. Then, a week or so after that switch, I received the Lumia 830 to review and went about using it as my everyday phone. And guess what? For the most part, I didn't really miss my shiny, new iPhone. Of course, it's by no means a complete replacement -- there are still games, features and apps on iOS that I can't get elsewhere (hello, AP Stylebook Mobile). But in general, life was rather pleasant with the 830. It's an Icon(ic) phone that cuts most of the right corners.. 830 , lumia 830 , lumia830 , microsoft , mobilepostcross , review , uk-reviews.

Phone Reviews Product Reviews. As recently as four years ago, Nokia was the world’s top cell-phone manufacturer. Yet, the Lumia 830 marks the end of an era: It’s the last Nokia phone ever. All subsequent Lumia devices will be branded by Microsoft, which has now absorbed the Finnish company’s phone division into its smartphone business.. Despite all that, both Nokia and Microsoft are pushing the 830 as an “affordable flagship.” Affordable, because it sacrifices a few things to keep the price of entry attractive, yet still a flagship because it’s one of the top mid-range Windows Phone devices launched in the U.S. We put the phone through its paces to find out if that combination turns out to be a proper swan song for Nokia.. Throughout its history in the phone business, Nokia knew how to make quality hardware, and the Lumia 830 is no exception. The metallic frame fuses together the 5-inch 1,280 x 720 pixel LCD screen on the front, and the plastic back in the rear. The volume, power, and camera shutter button line the right side. Surprisingly, both the headphone jack and Micro USB port are at the top of the device — a curious design choice, considering both tend to be found at the bottom these days.. Like most Windows Phone handsets, especially those in the Lumia line, the general look and feel here is familiar. The screen curves along the edges to blend in with the frame; the three touch-sensitive buttons retain their familiar places at the bottom; and the front-facing camera is in its predictable spot in the top right.. Impossible to miss on the back, the 10-megapixel PureView camera is also a prominent sight with its Carl Zeiss lens and optical image stabilization. Nokia did have to skimp a little bit on the sensor inside, so this isn’t anywhere near the quality of a Lumia 1020 camera.. Take the back off, and you have a removable 2,200mAh battery that is also Qi Wireless-enabled, plus the SIM card and MicroSD slots. The latter can handle up to 128GB, making for significant expansion from the 16GB internal storage out of the box.. Overall, I like the design of the Lumia 830. I’d hesitate to call it premium, but. always felt solid in my hands. With phones getting larger and larger these days, the last Nokia came out just right.. Nokia and Microsoft may call the Lumia 830 a “flagship,” but it’s not. The phone runs on a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor with 1GB of RAM. The display isn’t 1080p and tops up at a pixel density of 226ppi. These were flagship specs in 2012, not today.. Nokia Lumia 830 Compared To. Fortunately, Windows Phone is one of the leanest mobile operating systems around, and runs pretty efficiently.. The Lumia 830 has one of the deepest core camera apps of any smartphone out there.. The Lumia 830 runs on the Windows Phone Denim update, which offers some useful tweaks and features across the board, but is more heavily weighted toward the camera.. Lumia devices have long had the Windows Phone exclusive on Glance Screen, which displays information like the time, weather and (some, not all) notifications while on standby. It’s a lot like the Active Display feature seen in the Moto X, except it doesn’t activate with the simple Jedi-style wave of a hand. By default, it’s in “peek” mode, where a simple tap on the display pops everything up. You can also choose to have it come on at a set interval or stay on all the time, both of which will eat up more of the battery.. The other changes are cosmetic or mostly procedural. Despite the Lumia 830’s shortcomings on paper, swiping around the OS is fluid and painless, with few hiccups and slowdowns to frustrate along the way.. The Windows Store caused a lot of my frustration because its app catalog is an unusual mix of established must-haves and little known options. That dichotomy makes browsing and shopping in it a bit of a slog. Do a search for YouTube and you’ll understand what I mean.. This is a shame, but also a matter of circumstance. Windows Phone is clawing away to gain more users, but only a fraction (less than 5 percent) of smartphone users have ever used it. It’s hard to get app makers to support an OS that few people use.. Cortana is like the girl that shows up late to a party, but carries herself with confidence when she walks in. Microsoft’s voice assistant is comparable to the likes of Siri, Google Now, and the new BlackBerry Assistant, though it’s obvious that the folks in Redmond have some catching up to do.. In the United States, just saying “Hey, Cortana” will wake it up. I found the voice recognition to be pretty accurate, and doing a search query through Bing is easy enough. Cortana always listens for commands to make calls, take notes, set reminders, add calendar entries, read messages or email, and offer traffic information. Like the other voice assistants, there’s work to be done here to improve accuracy and reliability, but Microsoft is on the right course.. I love the camera on the Lumia 1020, and was curious to see whether the Lumia 830 would basically have a pared-down version of it to some degree. PureView was usually tailored to higher-end Lumia phones, so its inclusion here may have something to do with Microsoft and Nokia stamping this an affordable flagship. Sadly, The Lumia 830 can’t outperform the iPhone, though it is a capable shooter and has one of the deepest core camera apps of any smartphone out there.. The phone’s shutter button launches the camera app automatically, even if the phone is locked, which is a great Windows Phone feature. Launching the camera from standby does cause a delay of a few seconds, which cost me a few photo opportunities when I had to snap something quickly. Luckily, the image quality of the shots I did take partly made up for the slow start. The standard Auto mode is the default, though I could pick between a night and sports mode as well.. If I wanted to dig even deeper, there are also pro features for adjusting white balance, ISO, shutter speed, brightness, and manual focus. The smart sequence burst mode is a pretty good bet for snatching a good photo out of a group of bad ones in one snapshot, and holding down the shutter a little longer kicks in 1080p video capture. There were even different software “lenses” to choose from, including the Lumia Selfie and Lumia Cinemagraph. The former is self-explanatory as a selfie mode, and the latter incorporates a way to animate images and export them as GIFs or share via social media.. The optical image stabilization in the lens helps keep shakiness at bay, but the small sensor does struggle in low-light situations. Day or night, indoors or out, the overall results won’t beat out the best handsets on the market, but they are more than competitive against similarly priced rivals.. Speaking of mid-range, the lower specs actually bring out the best in the 2,200mAh battery, which easily lasted over a full day with moderate usage. One time I kept the Glance Screen on all night and was stunned to wake up and see that it had plenty of life left.. Keep a pair of earbuds or headphones close because the mono speaker in the back of the 830 is one of its weakest links. Lacking bass and noticeably distorting as the volume goes up, it’s simply not good enough for anything more than a brief YouTube clip or as a speakerphone for calls. Of course, few phone speakers are much better.. Call quality itself is good, and I encountered no real issues with it. Again, I’ve heard better in other devices, but it’s not enough to knock the Lumia 830 down a peg in that department.. At $100 on a two-year contract with AT&T, or $450 outright, you don’t necessarily have to break the bank to go in on this one. The Lumia 830 is a solid middle-of-the-road Windows Phone.. The camera’s consistent performance is great, but its specs are as low as a $180 Moto G. Watching Netflix or streaming music may be easy enough, but gaming is a mixed bag. If you’re a stickler for screen resolution and pixel density, then the Lumia 830 will disappoint, but I never felt the display hurt my enjoyment.. Nokia’s legacy isn’t fully represented in the Lumia 830, but it’s certainly an affordable way to hand over the branding reins to Microsoft, who will need a lot more devices like it to get prospective Windows Phone users to adopt its unique platform..

Not everyone wants to pay the premium $650 entry price of an iPhone 6. For about half the price, the Nokia Lumia 830 offers up an amazing design, solid camera, and great performance.. for Smartphones and Cell Phones. | March 6, 2015 -- 16:33 GMT (00:33 GMT+08:00). CNET awarded the Nokia Lumia 830 3.5 out of 5 stars. Back in November I wrote about my disappointment with Microsoft's non-existent high end Windows Phone lineup. Until the launch of Windows 10, Microsoft looks to be focused on the 'affordable flagship' and I thought that was a serious problem.. A few weeks ago, I decided to buy a Nokia Lumia 830, check out the ZDNet review , to see if there was any reason for a consumer to consider a mid-range device. It turns out I was wrong about the affordable flagship and you really can get by with a phone like the Lumia 830, at about half the price of an iPhone 6.. Since I am a T-Mobile US customer I had to find a device with appropriate LTE and HSPA+ bands support. While there is no such Lumia 930, you can find the Nokia Lumia 830 with such support, it's model number RM-985. I picked up an orange one since that is one of my favorite colors and I get tired of just black and white phones.. This was the first Nokia Lumia 830 I have seen in person and I was immediately impressed by the fantastic build quality, size in my hand, and presence of a microSD card, removable battery, and replaceable back cover.. Honestly, the Lumia 830 feels like a flagship with a five inch Gorilla Glass 3 display that curves along the edgs into a solid brushed aluminum frame. Distinct metal buttons adorn just the right side with the left side and bottom completely void of buttons or ports. The headphone jack and microUSB port are located on the top.. A 10 megapixel Carl Zeiss camera with 6 lenses and optical image stabilization is found on the back with interchangeable back covers hiding the 2200 mAh battery, microSD card, and SIM card. The AT&T model has support for PMA and Qi wireless charging in the back cover, while the SIM unlocked one I bought supports only Qi wireless charging.. The design and exterior make the Lumia 830 feel like a true flagship, the internal specs are where you will find mid-range features. The Lumia 830 is powered by a 1.2 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with 1GB of RAM, 16GB internal storage, and 1280 x 720 pixels display resolution.. The unlocked Lumia 830 with T-Mobile bands can be purchased for about $380 with the AT&T-compatible one for about $300 on Amazon. The locked, official AT&T version is available for $399.99. When you consider the lowest cost iPhone 6 is $649, it's tough not to at least consider the Lumia 830. Motorola offers the Moto X at just $399.99 so that is a bit tougher choice to make.. Fans of Nokia may also want to pick up the 830 since it looks to be the last device branded by the old Nokia.. As soon as I turned on the Lumia 830, I was prompted to update it to the latest Lumia Denim software. Microsoft also stated that Windows 10 will be coming to the Lumia 830 so I'm keeping it as my future test platform.. I went through all of the apps I have loaded on my iPhone 6 Plus and Sony Xperia Z3 then installed the same ones on my Lumia 830. There were only a few apps missing, primarily Google Services apps, and when I went a few days with just the Lumia 830 I found I was able to function just fine. Actually, the Fitbit app on Windows Phone has the most functionality and is more stable than the experience on iOS and Android.. The camera blew me away and when I went hiking with my family I use the Lumia 830 with impressive results. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 may be the only Android phone that can beat the Lumia 830 so if you buy one you should be more than satisfied with camera performance.. Cortana performs extremely well, the Action Center helps with productivity, and everything is zippy even with the Snapdragon 400 processor. I am even able to play Halo Spartan Assault flawlessly on the Lumia 830. For some reason Netflix doesn't work as it seems to get hung up on the stream.. As ZDNet's Steve Ranger wrote , the Lumia 830 is an elegant and fun piece of hardware. I don't have issues with missing apps and am satisfied with what is now available.. Getting such impressive performance from a sub-$400 smartphone definitely has me thinking twice about future purchases. I bought my 64GB iPhone 6 Plus for about $900 and as great as it is, it's not worth almost three Nokia Lumia 830s. If you want an affordable, functional smartphone then I highly recommend the Lumia 830.. Fujitsu Lifebook E558 review: Configurable and well-connected. MWC 2018: Sony Mobile unveils Xperia XZ2.
