So finally it’s official – Samsung has launched its much anticipated Galaxy S8 Active smartphone , thus putting an end to all the speculation that was doing the rounds. This is Samsung’s toughest Active smartphone yet, and also the most powerful one, so it’s certainly capable of raising many eyebrows.. Although Samsung decided to keep its launch muted by playing it simple with a press release, it’s certainly going to make some serious noise among all those smartphone buyers who prefer rough and tough phones. So let’s see what makes this device special.. First of all let’s talk about the design and build quality because those things have always been the hallmarks of Samsung’s Active smartphone series. It’s no different this time as well. – Galaxy S8 Active is a rough and tough device – yet very different, because this time Samsung is taking the guarantee of military-grade toughness for this device. Samsung Galaxy S8 Active has a shatterproof display, toughest grade metal body and bumpers to protect the corners of the device.. The design is shatter, dust and waterproof, which already says plenty about the build quality of this device. Another major design change that you’ll notice is the absence of Infinity display, which was essential to support its military grade toughness.. Besides these things, however, it’s just another Galaxy S8 with some minor differences. The display size remains same, the processor remains same, RAM remains same and cameras on both sides of the device are also the same. The battery, however, has been replaced with a bigger 4,000 mAh one. So the final specs sheet of this beast looks something like this:. Below, we have detailed what we’re hearing will be the specifications of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Active in 2017.. The device will also have Samsung’s shiny new toy called Bixby – the digital assistant software company has been developing for quite some time now, and a dedicated button to access it quickly.. It also has DIRECTV NOW app, which can be used to watch various TV shows live for as little as $10 per month. Iris scanners are also present in the device, and we hope this time they turn out to be better and more accurate than the ones included in Galaxy S8.. In the end let’s take a look at colors, availability, and pricing. Samsung Galaxy S8 Active has been released only in US market as of now, and therefore it’s an AT&T exclusive.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Samsung Galaxy S8 Active review:. Buy it for the truly all-day battery life. Samsung Galaxy S8 Active (Titanium Gold). Samsung Galaxy S8 Active (Meteor Gray). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Galaxy S8 Active has an all-day battery -- about 24 hours in our tests -- and has a sturdier body that’s basically a built-in case. It keeps the S8’s waterproofing and wireless charging.. The Bad Its flat screen isn’t as sharp as the regular S8's, and the S8 Active does away with the hardware buttons that helped give the original its identity.. The Bottom Line The Galaxy S8 Active is a great phone, but if battery life isn’t your top concern, you’ll save money buying a regular Galaxy S8 and a case.. No more nav buttons or convenience key. Confession: If it weren't for the Galaxy S8 Active's monster battery life, I'd tell you to buy the regular Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ) and a good case.. The Galaxy S8 Active costs more than the S8 for what is essentially a built-in case and screen protector, but not one of your own choosing. An S8-and-case combo would save you money and let you buy a case that works for you.. Those corners mean business, but the screw's just for show.. And then the S8 Active's truly all-day battery swoops in and saves the day. It lasted an average of 24 hours after five looping video drain tests, in airplane mode with the brightness set to 50 percent. In contrast, the Galaxy S8 lasted about 16 hours in our lab tests. In real life testing the phone gamely marched along, retaining power reserves after bedtime even after we'd streamed YouTube videos and navigated using Maps -- two of the most resource-taxing activities you can do on a phone.. The Active costs more than the regular S8 -- $100 more on US carrier AT&T -- so if you're willing to pony up extra cash to avoid topping off your phone's power quite as often as you would with the S8, then the S8 Active is a good choice. It's got all the Galaxy S8's top-notch features, and a sturdier screen and body, too.. If that battery delta isn't all that important to you, then who is the S8 Active really for? It does have a more rugged/sporty/outdoorsy aesthetic, and can appeal to people who don't want to worry about getting their phones messy or wet.. That said, Samsung has stripped the Galaxy S8 Active of a few past "Active" features, like those physical home buttons, that could make it feel like a truly different phone. And remember the Galaxy S8, S8 Plus and Note 8 are all already water-resistant.. My advice: If you're fine charging the S8's battery more often, the S8 Active offers a lot less this year to make it stand out from the S8. A case from brands like Ballistic and OtterBox can protect the Galaxy S8 from most drops just as well. I know, because I tested both phones side by side; I used a Spigen Tough Armor case on the regular S8.. We'll cover my drop test results later. But first, here's how the S8 Active diverges from the Galaxy S8 and previous Active phones.. The S8 Active has a thick metal-and-plastic body of past phones in the Active line, reinforced corners and a "shatterproof" screen similar to the Moto Z2 Force ( $756.00 at Best Buy ). These traits inherently protect the S8 Active from drops and spills.. But this year's model loses the three physical navigation buttons below the screen, which came in handy when you're wearing gloves or your hands are wet and the screen won't respond to your taps. Samsung made the change to give the Active a full-face display like the S8; buttons take up valuable screen space. I like the screen real estate, but I miss the buttons; they were a major part of the Active's identity.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News.

Samsung Galaxy S8 Active review: Come for the ruggedness, stay for the battery. Samsung's 'Active' line continues to carve out its own little niche for fans of high-end rugged phones.. Don't think of the Galaxy S8 Active as a legitimate improvement over the standard GS8 — because it isn't. Think of this as the best rugged phone choice for those who want something really tough but don't want to compromise on performance, display, camera or other features. Yes, it has a massive improvement in battery life, but in the name of sturdiness, it also loses all of the design that makes the Galaxy S8 so desirable in the first place.. Too big and heavy for most people. No particular differentiation outside of casing. 5.8-inch Super AMOLED, 2560 x 1440 (506 ppi) Gorilla Glass 5 Shatter-resistant. 12MP Dual Pixel, 1.4-micron pixels, f/1.7, OIS. USB-C Fast charging Fast wireless charging. Wi-Fi 802.11ac MIMO Bluetooth 5.1 NFC, GPS, Glonass, Galileo Wi-Fi Calling, HD Voice, Video calling. Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 20, 28, 29, 30, 38, 39, 40, 41, 66. 151.89 x 74.93 x 9.91 mm 208.09 g. Galaxy S8 Active Things you'll love. The thing you'll love most about the Galaxy S8 Active is that it's simply a Galaxy S8 at its core. Every spec, every feature and every component is the same. That means you're getting great performance, a whole boatload of software features and a camera that's still in the conversation with the best in the industry. It's water- and dust-resistant, of course, but that doesn't come at the cost of any fewer ports — you still get a headphone jack and flap-less USB-C connector. You also get to look at a beautiful Super AMOLED display with great brightness, even outdoors, which I'd expect you'd want for a phone that's this rugged.. The GS8 Active even keeps components like wireless charging, which you sometimes expect to lose with such a thick outer casing. That package of specs and features is a far shout from what you expect to get in most "rugged" style phones.. There is one spec change, though: the battery is now 4000mAh, a full 1000 larger than the Galaxy S8 and even 500 larger than the Galaxy S8+. As you'd expect, this offers excellent battery life. I ended most days with roughly 20-30% battery remaining, despite taking no measures throughout the day to limit usage or save precious capacity. That's awesome when you compare it to the standard Galaxy S8, which offers acceptable battery life but not a whole lot of runway for heavier days.. Samsung is also touting one other differentiator, which ties right into the "Active" name, and that's a "shatter-resistant" screen. You can, apparently, drop the phone from five feet onto a hard surface and have a guarantee that it won't shatter. Galaxy S8 Active Things you'll hate. In terms of actually using the Galaxy S8 Active every day, there isn't a whole lot to dislike. The one real downside of the GS8 Active is its overall size. It's wider, taller, thicker and heavier than the standard version — and not subtly, but dramatically. It's over 10 grams heavier than the Galaxy Note 8 , and its size kind of slots in between the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ — that's big, considering its screen size is the same as the GS8.. That size bump just makes the Galaxy S8 Active tougher to hold and use, even compared to the slippery Galaxy S8. It also isn't all that good looking when you set it alongside the sleek and smooth standard version.. But there's also one thing you can't see that you may find spoils your experience. That "shatter-resistant" screen rating is accomplished by putting a special film on top of the standard Gorilla Glass 5 screen covering. Similarly to what we saw on the Moto Z2 Force , this covering is extra susceptible to scratches in daily use — it's not scratching the glass, but instead the plastic on top. This is one of the trade-offs necessary when you have a screen that won't shatter when it's impacted.. The other big downside of the Galaxy S8 Active is its initial exclusivity to AT&T. Not only does that limit its availability to one of four major carriers — to say nothing of international availability — but it also means you get the typical AT&T treatment on the phone. That means roughly 10 pre-installed bloatware apps that you don't want or need (thankfully you can disable or uninstall most of it), and some superfluous changes to the software for no apparent reason. Thankfully the GS8 Active isn't supposed to be exclusive to the carrier forever — but we don't know when that period will end.. Whether by AT&T's doing or not, the Galaxy S8 Active is also quite expensive. At $849, it's $100 more than a standard GS8 and the same price as the Galaxy S8+. If you choose to buy the GS8 or GS8+ unlocked, you'll save roughly $175 with the former and $50 with the latter. That's a big premium to pay for a phone that is very much the same in terms of overall experience and features.. Get it for rugged, not for battery. Galaxy S8 Active Should you buy it?. Power users who are always hunting for the biggest possible battery will undoubtedly be drawn to the idea of a high-end phone like the Galaxy S8 with an extra-large 4000mAh battery. And yes, the Galaxy S8 Active provides that — it is, in terms of features, software and performance, every bit the same as a standard Galaxy S8. But in order to get that 4000mAh battery, you have to give up quite a bit of what makes the standard Galaxy S8 so appealing — primarily, its entire hardware design.. The battery improvement is a big plus; but the design is an even bigger minus.. The Galaxy S8 Active is massively heavier and larger in every dimension than the Galaxy S8, and even loses its hallmark curved glass screen. That last part may also seem like a bonus — but the added width and thickness makes up for it in terms of poor ergonomics. With its super-thick and tough exterior, the Galaxy S8 Active doesn't look, or more importantly feel , like a Galaxy S8 anymore — and that is, after all, a big chunk of what you're paying for when you buy one.. No, I wouldn't recommend someone who wants a Galaxy S8 consider a Galaxy S8 Active just for the battery. The downsides of its size, shape, design and price just aren't worth it. But I would absolutely recommend this phone to someone who must have a "rugged" phone to survive the daily demands of their life or job, and doesn't want to compromise in terms of the software, features, camera or experience of the phone in the process..

The Samsung Galaxy S8 Active takes the best phone of the year, makes it tougher, and packs in a bigger battery. The Samsung Galaxy S8 set the standard for smartphones earlier this year, with a tall-and-narrow build, top-of-the-line specs, and feature-rich software. But its largely glass-and-metal build makes it relatively fragile, and requires you to take some care when handling it. The Samsung Galaxy S8 Active ($849.99) is for people who don't want to baby their phones. It's essentially the same device as the standard S8 , wrapped in a durable polycarbonate shell that gives it much greater protection against bumps, drops, and scrapes. It also has a bigger battery, and on T-Mobile it has the new frequency Band 71 for rural coverage. That makes it the best rugged phone money can buy, and our Editors' Choice.. The S8 Active is built like a tank. The back of the phone consists of a hardened gray or gold polycarbonate shell. Along the sides, there is metal, reinforced by hard rubber ridges on each corner for better impact resistance. This shell wraps around the sides of the phone, doing away with the curves that make the S8 so attractive, but also so fragile.. View All 5 Photos in Gallery. I subjected the S8 Active to a series of torture tests, including six-foot drops to wood, tile, and concrete floors. It survived without any visible damage. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that while the screen may be more durable due to the reinforced sides and a shatterproof layer not found on the the regular S8, it's still susceptible to being scratched.. Like the S8, the Active is rated IP68, so it can survive in 6 feet of water for at least 30 minutes. It worked fine after a thorough rinsing and handled immersion without a problem, just make sure you don't try to charge it until the port is dry.. Of course, this increased durability comes at the cost of added size and bulk. The S8 Active measures 6.0 by 3.0 by 0.4 inches (HWD) and weighs a hefty 7.3 ounces, a notable increase from the regular S8 (5.8 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces). It's also heavier than the S8+ (6.1 ounces) and the Note 8 (6.9 ounces). But compared with other rugged phones like the Kyocera DuraForce Pro (5.8 by 2.9 by 0.5 inches, 8.1 ounces), it's about average.. Along the sides, you have all the same buttons and ports as the S8. A power button is on the right and a volume rocker on the left, with a Bixby button below it replacing the customizable Active button on previous Active models. The bottom has a 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C charging port, and speaker. The SIM/microSD card slot is located at the top and worked fine with a 256GB card. The fingerprint sensor on the back is still set to the right of the camera, making it too easy to accidentally smudge the lens.. On the front you'll find a tall-and-narrow 5.8-inch, 2,560-by-1,440 Super AMOLED display. Because it doesn't wrap around the sides, it's technically not an "Infinity" screen, but is otherwise very similar to the panel in the regular S8. Its resolution is a sharp 506 pixels per inch (ppi), which is actually a little less sharp than the 2,960-by-1,440 S8 (570ppi), but the difference is barely perceptible. The Super AMOLED panel gives you rich, saturated colors, inky blacks that help save power by only lighting pixels as needed, and excellent viewing angles. The screen gets very bright and remains visible even in direct sunlight.. We tested the Galaxy S8 Active on AT&T, and that model supports LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/20/28/29/30/38/39/40/41/66. This is standard fare for a top-tier phone; the only noteworthy inclusion is band 66, which gives carriers more room to combine spectrum and improve downlink. During field testing in midtown Manhattan, network performance was decent, with 9.3Mbps down and 15.3Mbps up. Lopsided download and upload speeds like this usually indicates network congestion, and overall results are in line with what we've seen on other AT&T phones in the same area.. If you get the T-Mobile model, the phone also supports the carrier's new Band 71 , its 600MHz spectrum for covering rural areas. It plans to roll out this new coverage starting in 2018. For now, the only other phone with Band 71 is the LG V30, so if you're interested in that potential additional coverage, you really want to look hard at the Galaxy S8 Active.. Because it has a Snapdragon 835 processor, the S8 Active will be compatible with gigabit networks once they start rolling out. Other connectivity protocols include dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.1 (which improves range and lets you stream to two devices at the same time), and NFC, letting you use Android Pay. Samsung Pay comes preinstalled and works with nearly all card reader terminals.. See How We Test Cell Phones. Transmissions have clear, natural tones and are easily audible on both ends. Noise cancellation is excellent at blotting out nearly all background noise including wind and traffic. Earpiece volume is loud, and we had no trouble taking a call in a noisy environment. The bottom-facing speaker gets reasonably loud, if a bit tinny. Wi-Fi calling and HD voice are both supported.. As mentioned above, the S8 Active is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor clocked at 2.35GHz and has 4GB of RAM. Performance is virtually identical to the standard Galaxy S8, so see our review for a complete rundown. In short, the S8 Active is a fast, powerful phone that can handle anything you throw at it. Generally speaking it's much more capable than most other rugged phones like the LG X Venture .. The S8 Active also has the same 12-megapixel rear camera and 8-megapixel front camera as the Galaxy S8. Its performance is unparalleled, and remains the best camera phone we've tested. See our original review for an in-depth look at performance and sample images.. Aside from design, battery is the biggest difference between the S8 Active and the standard S8. The Active houses a 4,000mAh battery, for a nice bump in capacity over the S8's 3,000mAh cell. In our rundown test, in which we stream full-screen video over LTE at maximum screen brightness, that translated to 8 hour, 54 minutes of runtime, which is good deal longer than the S8, (5 hours, 45 minutes) and DuraForce Pro (5 hours, 39 minutes). That should get you well over a day's worth of use, and you can take advantage of fast charging with the included adapter. Samsung's proprietary fast wireless charging is also supported, though you'll need to buy the charging puck separately.. The Active runs Android 7.0 Nougat with Samsung's heavy TouchWiz UI layer on top. Once again, it's identical to what you'll find on the S8. The one additional feature you get on the Active series is the preloaded Activity Zone app. Launching it gives you quick access to a barometer, compass, flashlight, health tracking, a stopwatch, and weather information.. Left to right: Galaxy S8 Active, Galaxy S8. As with all carrier phones, you'll find some bloatware, but it's more minimal than you might expect. There were nine AT&T apps, a few of which can be uninstalled. When you first set up the phone you're given the choice if you want to install apps like Samsung Pay and Samsung Health. Surprisingly, Google apps you normally can't delete like Android Pay, Google Drive, and Google Photos, can all be removed if you desire.. Out of the total internal storage of 64GB, the S8 Active leaves you with 49.56GB available. That's a good amount of space for apps and photos, and you can supplement it with a microSD card.. For a $100 premium over the standard S8, the Galaxy S8 Active gets you more battery life and increased durability. If you're looking for a phone that can stand up to abuse and doesn't compromise on performance, it's your best option and our Editors' Choice. The Band 71 support on the T-Mobile version is just a cherry on top. Of course, you can also buy a regular Galaxy S8 and wrap it up in a protective case .. Bottom Line: The Samsung Galaxy S8 Active takes the best phone of the year, makes it tougher, and packs in a bigger battery. Ajay Kumar is PCMag's Analyst obsessed with all things mobile.

Donât get me wrong, there is always something good about having choice in the Android space, but more so than any other year before it, this Active version of the original Galaxy S smartphone seems redundant. The Active line used to bring some different features underneath a dramatically different design which set it apart, but now it feels outdated. In this piece, weâre going to look at a few of the reasons why I personally think the Active line has lost its way.. I used to be a huge proponent of this version of Samsungâs flagship lineup. Back at E3 2015, the Galaxy S6 Active was what was on my mind. It had just been announced a couple of months earlier and it seemed to look much better than the Galaxy S5 Active from the year prior.. Once I got my hands on it, I understood another reason why I wanted the Active – the Galaxy S6 that year was a stark change from the plastic designs of Samsungâs recent past, as glass and metal bodies became the new design language. I never thought the previous S5 was a looker, but the S6 Active felt like the best of both worlds and I honestly thought it looked great.. Whereas glass on glass bodies were clearly going to define our future, I was trying to hold on to the past: a time when phones were meatier, sturdier, and less inclined to go for what could only be considered more delicate designs.. I still feel the same way about todayâs phones – glass is king, but there are some phones I have gravitated to because they donât just follow the pack. My recent piece on the BlackBerry KEYone as my daily driver is a great example of this. You would think that now, more than ever, the Galaxy S8 Active is trying to scratch that chunky itch in Samsung’s own huge inventory of glass and metal-clad phones.. But Samsung was able to make the Infinity Display, once called the Edge Display, one of the most sought after design features in their main flagships. By the time of the Galaxy Note 7, the curved display had proven itself as more than eye candy – it is now Samsungâs default way of getting larger screens onto smaller bodies. As I said numerous times in the Galaxy S8 hands on and review, the feel of the 5.8-inch phone is simply sublime.. The smartphone industry as a whole is moving toward this minimal bezel, big-screen-for-less philosophy. The smartphone industry as a whole is moving toward this minimal bezel, big-screen-for-less philosophy, so the throwback design of the Galaxy S8 Active doesnât give off the same good vibes as before. This screen is flat, the bezels are so much bigger than weâre used to anymore, and the phone has a heft that, while still welcome, is contrary to the kind of slim and light bodies that were once foreign a few years ago and are now the norm. Bigger bodies can mean better durability, though.. Donât get me wrong – there are very valid reasons to go for the Active over the original S8 and S8 Plus. Users who have butter fingers will have a much better time when they inevitably drop this phone. Most people would definitely prefer to suffer some scuffs on a harder plastic material rather than shattered glass on either side of the phone.. But smartphone manufacturers have gotten better and better at providing IP certifications with their flagship devices without compromising current design tropes or by resorting to covers, gaskets, and seals. So the enhanced water-resistance of the Active line isn’t as big of a deal as it once was.. The Active is an example of a phone that tries to look as tough as it actually is, or maybe itâs the other way around. A while back, the big draw of a rugged phone like the Galaxy S8 Active would have been that it had MIL-STD-810G certification. But now phones like the LG V30 – in some ways just as beautiful as the Galaxy S8 – also have a MIL-STD-810G rating.. Considering the LG V30's looks and MIL-STD-810G rating, is a phone with the design of the Active actually necessary anymore?. The S8 Active may well be more rugged than the V30, but the gap is not nearly as wide as it used to be. In the Android space, we now have phones that have managed to combine the two philosophies of the Galaxy S and the Galaxy S Active dichotomy: looks and ruggedness. When the time comes, we’ll drop them both to find out if a phone with the design of the Active is actually necessary anymore.. I do want to highlight one bright spot of this ruggedized phone: thankfully, some of what makes the Active line more appealing than its original counterparts remains – in particular, the internals.Â. One major plus the S8 Active offers is in battery life.Â. The Active isnât chunkier for no reason – the larger body houses a 4,000 mAh unit that is 1000 mAh more than the original S8 and 500 mAh more than the S8 Plus. With all other things being equal, the S8 Active just goes harder for longer.. This is something that I really loved about the S6 Active and Iâm happy to see it continue in the current generation. If you’ve complained about battery size in the S8 and S8 Plus, the S8 Active is worth considering for this fact alone.. The camera is unchanged and provides the same exact experience as the Galaxy S7 and the S8, and there is no problem with performance due to all phones across the board having the same technical specifications.. If you've complained about battery size in the S8 and S8 Plus, the S8 Active is worth considering for this fact alone.. The main significant loss with this year’s model of the Active is the Active Key. Anyone that knows me here is probably sick of me talking about extra inputs on phones – again, I bring up the BlackBerry KEYone because I can make so much happen easily with the help of shortcuts on the stellar physical keyboard. The Galaxy S Active had that kind of capability thanks to just that one extra button in the top corner.Â. The loss of the Active Key made me immediately dislike this yearâs edition of the Active.. It was such a subtle but powerful tool, a button that can be customized to open any application when you either press it or hold it down. I used it for so many different app combinations.. It wasn’t just for convenience, but for productivity.. A tap on the button brought me to the calendar, and a long press opened up my money management application. The phone’s longer battery life only enhanced this experience, allowing me to get more done on a single charge.. But in the new S8 Active, that key is gone, replaced by the bane of many a current Samsung userâs existence: Bixby. Now, I understand that Bixby has gotten better in recent months and, given a learning curve, users can get quite a bit out of Samsungâs assistant.. But just look at all the people who wanted to replace the function of the Bixby button to a user customizable state- exactly what the Active Key offered. Now you understand how I felt about Actives in years past: they offered everything I wanted with the ability to change what I didn’t.. Actives in years past offered me everything I wanted with the ability to change what I didn't.. I can see why the Galaxy S8 Active might appeal to some users, but considering where we are in the flagship game, I canât help but think that the majority of users will gravitate more toward the curves of the originals. A bigger screen in a smaller body is much more enticing than a bigger body with a less accessible screen.. If you are looking specifically for the features that set the S8 Active apart, like its rugged looks and bigger battery, then have at it. But unfortunately for a user like me that used to love the Active line for even more, the list of reasons has shrunken as the list of things Samsung is trying to do has grown. Itâs a jump forward followed by a stumble backward.. Samsung , Samsung Galaxy S8 Active. Please enter a valid email address. Android Authority APP Get it on. Your source for all things Android!.

There are two striking visual differences between the Galaxy S8 Active and the Galaxy S8.

It measures a massive 5.8-inches, yet the body is surprisingly compact. It’s the first Active phone to not have physical buttons under the screen, which may be a cause for concern for those who wear thick gloves.. The second difference is the Galaxy S8 Active’s MIL-STD-810G rated, military-standard suit of armor. The tough exterior gives the S8 Active shock, shatter, water, and dust resistance.

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 64 GB + MicroSD. View all photos (34). Available: AT&T , T-Mobile , Sprint. Click to read the full review. Extremely high pixel density screen (568 ppi). Lots of RAM (4 GB RAM). Large camera sensor pixel size (1.4 μm). TheGalaxy S8 Active shares most of its internals with the regular S8, but it's got a tougher, different-looking exterior. That means you still get the Snapdragon 835 chip, paired with 4 GB RAM and 64 GB, the cameras are also the same as in the S8 (12 MP rear and 8 MP front). The new phone's 5.8-inch, 1440 x 2960 pixels display is flat and protected by raised margins, while a "durable metal frame" makes the device shock-resistant. Overall, the S8 Active will be a bit taller, wider, thicker, and heavier than the regular S8 - not only because of its rugged design, but also because it packs a larger (4000 mAh) battery.. Samsung Galaxy S8 Active Review Samsung Galaxy S8 Active manual Samsung Galaxy S8 Active benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.99 x 2.95 x 0.39 inches (152.1 x 74.9 x 9.9 mm). Weight: 7.34 oz (208 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). IP certified - The IP code indicates the degree of protection against dust and water. The first number represents dust protection, while the second represents water protection. In IP67, for example, 6 means a completely dust-tight device, while 7 means the device can stay immersed in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes. In IP68, a higher level of water protection is expected, but exact numbers aren't specified: both depth and continuance are specified by the manufacturer on per device basis.. Display Physical size: 5.8 inches. Resolution: 1440 x 2960 pixels. Features: HDR video support, Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 5), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Optical image stabilization, Autofocus (Phase detection). Software Features: Manual focus, Object tracking, RAW image capture, Touch to focus, Smile detection, Face detection, Voice activation, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging.

Features: Wide Angle, Autofocus, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2350 MHz, Kryo 280, 64-bit, 10 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 32.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 5.0 days (120 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: DLNA, Wireless screen share, MHL.

FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

I am a former S5 Active customer and could not wait for the S8 active's release. I am a busy parent with kids so our family heavily relies on mobile phones when running around town for kid sporting events, etc. The first thing that I was amazed by was the battery life. There is a performance mode feature on the phone that also helps extends the life. Very helpful! The phone itself runs apps at blazing speeds. I understand display ratings are important for some reviewers but for me. I am not concerned with the display resolution as long as youtube/ netflix is running when in a tight pinch. Taking pictures and video were a huge step up from the S5 active so this was noticeable too. I found myself using wifi-calling features more often but that is because my carrier doesn't reach everywhere. The design is great, very dense when holding it and very rugged in appearance. I like that the back panel is no longer removable. The only issue that we have experienced was that the humidity sensor definitely works in southern climates! When the outdoor temps were 90+ degrees with very high humidity, we had to find creative ways to recharge the battery during a "reboot" procedure that we googled. Other than that, we are very pleased. Would recommend to other parents too.. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 2 Interface, Bixby, Activity Zone, Processor and Connectivity. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Corey Gaskin. AT&T - AT&T + Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 2 Interface, Bixby, Activity Zone, Processor and Connectivity. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction Samsung’s Galaxy Active series, and increasingly ruggedized wearables, have helped establish the company’s prowess as the only true champion for more active (or careless) mobile consumers. Starting with the Galaxy S4 Active , Samsung began offering IP67 waterproofing – years before it was a flagship standard – and rugged design, which has now expanded to military standard certifications in drop tests, extreme temperatures, and IP68 waterproofing. Year after year these Active variants have been released shortly after Samsung’s Galaxy flagship, often tweaking small aspects of inner hardware to match the outer theme. This year we see arguably the Android phone of the year – the Galaxy S8 – step up 1000 milliamps in battery size, and gain all the rugged military-grade hardware to produce the Galaxy S8 Active. But in a world where IP67 is the norm for flagship phones – some even offer “shatterproof” displays – is the Active series still needed? Let’s examine what it brings to the table. In the box: Galaxy S8 Active USB-A to USB-C adapter (female to male) Micro-USB to USB-C adapter (female to male) USB-C to USB-A charging cable Adaptive fast-charging wall plug Warranty and Getting Started guide Design The Galaxy S8 Active is the first Active device released since Galaxy flagships have crossed over entirely to curved, “bezel-less” designs; no longer are the “Edge” variants alone in this style. As one might anticipate, though, the S8 Active can’t afford to expose that much glass in its edges if it endeavors to survive 5-foot drops, as stated in the Active features. Gorilla Glass 5 encases the display, which is then covered by a “shatter-resistant” shield. Unfortunately, early reports seem to indicate that this shield is very soft and prone to scratches, much like the Moto Z2 Force’s “shatterproof” screen , which garnered similar criticism. Dense metal comprises the sides of the phone, while the corners are reinforced with a hard, rubberized plastic. Bixby still has a dedicated and clicky button underneath the similarly clicky volume buttons, while the power button on our unit had a slightly mushier, and less satisfying click than the other three. Gone is the home button from the S7 Active, continuing in the trend of the S8. We’ll see how this strikes users who may need more rugged, tactile buttons more often than the average user might. Meeting military specification’s (MIL-STD-810G) for enduring drops, extreme temperatures, and much more, as well as IP68 water and dust proofing, the S8 Active is a phone of solid constitution. The thicker edges of the device not only add durability, but also space for a 1000-milliamp increase in battery capacity. Altogether, the added thickness and weight still leave the device with a good feel in-hand. While of course not as light as the svelte S8 (50 grams heavier to be exact) the S8 Active is only about 20 grams heavier than the S7 Active, with the same thickness and width, while only being about a tenth of an inch taller. Once again, Samsung achieves a sturdy design that leaves no worries in the most fearless outdoor warriors heart, while still making a pocketable device that feels substantial, but not like a brick in the hand (or pocket).. Display Though the infinity display isn’t in full effect here, with its typically curved design and near-bezel-less edges, you’ll still find the rounded corners and high screen-to-body ratio (75%) which buyers so loved on the regular S8. Though the 5.8-inch screen size is the same for the two, the metal/plastic casing that comprises the Active’s protective bulk brings that ratio down some from the original S8’s 84% ratio. Samsung’s trademark Super AMOLED technology looks just as good on the Active as on the S8 before it, even without the curved edges. Capable of brightness that can stare back undaunted at the sun’s rays, but also lower far enough for comfortable night reading, we have little to complain about here, although it’s still susceptible to the ills of any AMOLED display. Colors are pleasing to look at, albeit super saturated with less-than-perfect viewing angles which produce a bluish hue as the phone is tilted. Color accuracy can be tweaked to an extent by utilizing various color modes and sliders found in the display settings, though we found most tweaks to affect red balances more than anything, never quite giving us proper color representation. Although somewhat bluish, we found the default Adaptive Display mode to be the most pleasing to look at. Meeting the same resolution as the S8 and S7 Active, the S8 Active produces 1440 x 2960 pixels. It’s a quite pleasing screen to view pictures and video, or consume content of any kind. But of course, its 18.5:9 ratio still lends itself to cropping or letterboxing in most video-watching scenarios.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

It's a heavier phone than the normal S8? I mean....... (Posts: 591; Member since: 23 Oct 2011). posted on 26 Sep 2017, 11:08. Lmaoo right, is it not its purpose? It's suppose to be rugged so being heavier that the regular s8 is a given. What kind of petty con is that?. (Posts: 59; Member since: 09 Aug 2017). posted on 26 Sep 2017, 12:09. That gave me a little laugh because I feel like the reviewer is a little sissy.. (Posts: 1206; Member since: 05 Oct 2011). posted on 26 Sep 2017, 15:07. PA's Review system is flaw I am glad I was not they only one to see that. "its a heavier phone.." Duh!!11 as you stated it's a rugged version it has to have heft. So now being heavy is a con for a rugged model? I cant comprehend PA's reviews at all. There is no objectivity they need to establish a grading system that treats and grades all features and non features the same then they could be honest fair reviews. I mean you cant call one thing a "con" for one vendor but a "pro" for another vendor and vise versa.. (Posts: 202; Member since: 04 Jul 2015). posted on 01 Jan 2018, 15:17. in response to #34 Hide. The next review will say "This phone is heavier than it's predecessor giving it that solid and premium feel". I personally prefer phones lighter the better. But, it's hilarious to me how reviewers come up with these arbitrary "quality" factors. Especially "premium" materials like aluminum and glass. Crap, has anyone every thought about how ancient both of those materials are for use on modern technology? Jewelry, well that's different..

I got to play with the S8 Active at a Sprint store (walking distance #notmycarrier), boy is it light but oh so satisfying. This is how a premium smartphone should feel..

Have your customers, we that view your site daily to comment on the standard then finalize it. Standards that aren't skewed towards a Manufacturer and apply across the board... Rate each section then average the scores... The scores are applied with no methodology other than what I feel. I know it doesn't matter, but it concerns me.....

A little disappointing to see the battery life go down since my Active S6, but that screen and camera are unmatched, not to mention I can't not take my phone in the shower now lol (spoiled), so I would never get anything less than IP68. The very fact that iphones still run basically the same iOS from 2008 with a focus on emoticons (seriously apple smh) means they should never get rated better than an 8 out of 10 in my opinion, regardless of the design or build quality. There is just zero innovation and they are overpriced children's toys compared to this beauty. The Active is a real man's product with top notch quality, and hopefully the AT&T exclusivity ends soon so more people can see for themselves.. (Posts: 141; Member since: 12 Apr 2015). posted on 26 Sep 2017, 11:56. Shocked a non samsung flagship received such a high score. posted on 26 Sep 2017, 15:52. I don't see how you can say it's not a flagship. That's literally exactly what it is. Don't let the "active" moniker confuse you..

A lot of high-performance hardware held back by unfriendly UI and poor design choices. Only for AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile customers who want a rugged Galaxy S8 and can’t fathom buying a case, but can spend up to $280 extra.. Costs more than a standard Galaxy S8 with a great case. 4K video is a lost cause. The Galaxy S8 Active borrows some of the best aspects of the standard Samsung Galaxy S8 , and puts them into a chassis that's more prepared for a busy and accident-prone lifestyle. The result is a long-lasting phone effectively built into its own case.. If you’re looking for a phone that offers the best performance without living on the bleeding edge of design, the Galaxy S8 Active may just be that phone. It’s ready for the occasional tumble, whether that be onto hard ground or a puddle. Brush off any dust, dirt or water, and it’s good to go.. First, it’s $850, well above the price of the Galaxy S8. It sacrifices aesthetics big time, and its ruggedness doesn’t prevent unsightly dings and nicks.. Great hardware and a beautiful display keep things fast and pretty, and the massive battery can keep the phone running for ages. But, it suffers from the same poor placement of sensors and buttons as the Galaxy S8, and Bixby doesn’t make everything better, so it can be tedious to use. The Galaxy S8 Active has a great photo camera, but the new fad that is 4K video recording was less than dazzling on this device.. At its best, the Galaxy S8 Active is a simple and vastly more robust repackaging of the Galaxy S8 just like in the previous generation, but it's definitely not the right fit for everyone.. ( Update: The S8 Active has recently broken its exclusivity ties with AT&T, moving along to T-Mobile and Sprint as well. This is the first in the Active line to support other carriers and the S8 Active continues to be a fantastic option for those who want a rugged smartphone ). The Galaxy S8 Active is built to look rugged. It takes the same tall display panel found in the Galaxy S8, flattens it, and reinforces its every edge with metal and plastic bumpers.. The body is what Samsung describes as “military-grade.” It has an IP68 rating against dust and water ingress, so it can hang out in 5 feet of water for half an hour (Note: the standard Galaxy S8 is also IP68 rated). But Samsung didn’t stop the testing there, as it earned the Galaxy S8 Active a passing grade for the MIL-STD-810G military specification testing, which puts the phone through intensive temperature, dust, shock, vibration, pressure, and altitude testing. The LG G6 and LG V30 are a few other recent smartphones to carry such a distinction.. The S8 Active has an all-glass front that is shatter-resistant up to five feet if dropped on a flat surface, thanks to Gorilla Glass 5, which the normal Galaxy S8 also has. In my drop test, the phone shrugged off a five foot drop face-first onto a solid stone floor. The metal frame extends above the surface of the screen, so it should absorb the impact on flat surfaces.. Meanwhile, the rear of the phone is made to look metallic, with a concrete-like texture, but actually feels and sounds like it may be plain old plastic.. For ports, it features a single speaker grille on the bottom, alongside a USB-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There’s a SIM-card slot on the top, power button on the right and volume buttons and a dedicated Bixby button on the left. On the phone’s rear side sits its 12MP camera surrounded by a heart rate sensor and a fingerprint scanner, both of which are hard to find without turning the phone over.. In the process of making the Galaxy S8 Active more rugged than the standard Galaxy S8, Samsung sacrificed aesthetics in a big way. The Galaxy S8 Active isn’t exactly ugly (until it meets pavement), and even has a utilitarian sort of charm, but its blocky look can’t compare to the sleek appeal of the Galaxy S8 with its curved edges.. Because the Galaxy S8 Active is branded as a device capable of more survivability than your typical phone, the ruggedness of the phone deserves its own section. At first glance, the phone looks rugged, thanks to the wide metal frame and extra metal bumpers screwed on at each end.. The design ought to offer better protection than the standard Galaxy S8 or Samsung Galaxy Note 8 , as the metal edges raise slightly above screen level, so they’ll take the hit on a flat surface. There’s no glass back on the Galaxy S8 Active either, so there’s less to shatter back there. I let the phone take a few tumbles that it easily shrugged off. That said, the structural integrity of the Galaxy S8 Active doesn’t help it resist scratching to the metal and plastic surfaces, which will clearly display where they’ve hit concrete. They don’t like keys either, and a solid design shouldn’t be equated with a license for carelessness for this phone – it’s not an old Nokia.. While I was making a sandwich, I let the Galaxy S8 Active play around in the sink. As could be expected, the touchscreen went haywire, and the fingerprint scanner wasn’t registering fingerprints with all the water everywhere. But after a quick pat dry, it was back in action. A notification appeared on the phone stating that moisture was detected in the port, so I and anyone else would know not to try charging the phone until it had fully dried out.. On the plus side, the screen is still phenomenal, just like that of the Galaxy S8. You won’t suffer from a lack of crispness, as the Galaxy S8 Active packs in a 5.8-inch display with a resolution of 2,960 x 1,440. Oddly, the phone was set to run at a reduced resolution by default, not taking advantage of all the pixels, and actually making text and small icons blurry. This was one of the first things I corrected, letting the pixel density of the display shine.. Making the display all the better is the Super AMOLED technology, which offers incredible picture quality thanks to its high contrast ratio. And while some AMOLED displays can be a bit dim, I found the Galaxy S8 Active display was easy to see even when strolling down the street at noon on a cloudless day, though watching video content in the sun wasn’t so great.. As more top-of-the-line smartphones move away from bezels, shrinking or doing away with them entirely, the Galaxy S8 Active does feel like it’s behind the curve. This high-end display is surrounded on all sides by a noticeable bezel. And since the bezels are black, they do occasional blend in with the screen when there’s dark imagery or backgrounds on the phone’s display.. Next Page What it's like to use.

REVIEW OVERVIEW Build Quality Performance Price Display Camera Software SUMMARY. T he Samsung Galaxy S8 Active is the best rugged phone you’ll find on the market. Sure, there aren’t that many of them available; however, the Active line time and again rises to the top. The 2017 iteration is not only among the best in rugged and durable phones, but it’s also one of the most compelling packages offered right now.. In the early days of rugged phones we had to contend with less than desirable performance. We traded away sleek and sexy in favor of rough and tumble. If you were a general contractor or plumber in the market for a new phone to take on job sites, you had to choose from ugly and uninspired stuff. Even worse, the phones were a generation or two behind the rest of the pack.. Somewhere over the last few generations, though, Samsung figured out a way to deliver timely hardware in a body that was more sleek. Its Galaxy S Active series of devices, which has been exclusive to AT&T, is a great way to keep up with the Joneses, and have something designed to take moderate abuse.. The Galaxy S7 Active (2016) was a tremendous step forward for the line, and even bested the S7 standard bearer with a bigger battery. As for this year’s model, the S8 Active is another stellar device that delivers best-in-class specifications at its core. Indeed, it’s all Galaxy S8 under the hood.. What we really enjoy about the S8 Active is that it’s all of the good stuff in the Galaxy S8. The Super AMOLED display, excellent camera, Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB RAM, and 64GB storage are what you expect in top phone in 2017. Also present are USB-C, water and dust resistance, and headphone jack.. When it comes to performance, it’s damn near impossible to get more than what comes in the aforementioned specifications. Yes, you can stack them up on benchmarks and create a pecking order. Does that stuff matter to you? We suspect that most people. can’t discern the differences in hardware on daily tasks. There’s very little you can throw at a phone like this that will tax it.. We saw no stutters, lags, or performance issues in the Galaxy S8 Active. Everything, from just checking email and messages, to games and always-synchronizing services like Slack and Todoist, went swimmingly.. Be careful in reading too much into these words. Don’t look at the S8 Active as an improvement or enhanced version of the flagship phone. It is, to a degree, a souped-up model in areas. is everything that makes the Galaxy S8 so sexy. The beautiful body, sleek lines, and all of those premium materials are absent here.. The S8 Active’s screen is flat whereas the Galaxy S8 is curved; its resolution is 2,560 x 1,440 while the flagship offers up. The devil is in the details, and that matters to some.. Also, the display is protected by a special film or plastic that is prone to pick up scratches. This is one of the trades you’ll still make when dealing with a rugged phone. The glass is shatter-resistant, and will stand up to drops… but .. The top layer absorbs the scuffs and scratches of life and will show up over time. To us, though, we’ll take that any day. Nothing beats the peace of mind in knowing with almost 100 percent certainty that a dropped phone is going to look okay when we flip it over. Samsung says the S8 Active can withstand a 5-foot drop.. The Galaxy S8 Active is also heavier than its flagship counterpart. In fact, it’s even heavier than the Galaxy Note 8. Part of the weight comes in a 4,000mAh battery. Yes, a full 1,000mAh more than the Galaxy S8 and 500mAh more than the Galaxy S8+. This means you’ll end up with plenty of juice left over at the end of the day.. Realistically you could expect to get two days of average use out of the S8 Active. Mileage varies, to be sure, but we’ve come to appreciate this much life and we think you would, too.. In the area of cameras, the S8 Active’s setup is identical to the one in both the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S8. Specifically, it’s a single 12-megapixel sensor with an f/1.7 aperture.. As we, and others, found with this to consistently deliver bright, sharp photos with. The software is a real winner, too, thanks to a variety of shooting modes such as Selective Focus (DSRL-like bokeh). (manual settings for shutter speed, focus, and ISO).. Around front, the S8 Active’s selfie-camera is equally solid. The Wide Selfie is a neat trick which lets one snap panoramic-like shots. Samsung’s augmented reality (AR) stickers are similar to what you get in Snapchat and Instagram and make for a fun experience.. One of the other downsides to the Galaxy S Active line, thus far, is that it is exclusive to AT&T. This means you’ll end up with the carrier’s preloaded apps and services.. To that end you can look forward to nearly one dozen titles.. You can uninstall or disable most of them, but you’ll have to find a way to hide the others. That is, of course, if you don’t want to see them. If you’re an AT&T fan through and through, you might find value in them.. As of the time of this review we understand that T-Mobile may soon offer its own take on the Galaxy S8 Active.. The Samsung Galaxy S8 Active is pricey. With a sticker of $850 it falls on the high end of what smarphone makers command. It’s $100 more than the flagship model and the same cost of the Galaxy S8+ when purchased through AT&T. Go unlocked, though, and the S8 Active could be much more costly by comparison.. We definitely won’t list this phone among the most beautiful or sophisticated designs. It’s downright ugly, boring, and blocky when compared to others. On the other hand, it is better looking than its predecessors. We’re surely not the only ones to appreciate that Samsung left the camouflage off this year’s model.. Don’t purchase the S8 Active strictly on the merit of a larger battery. Do consider it, however, if your needs call for a phone that withstands abuse. Have young children in the house? If they expect to get to play with your device, you’ll want the peace of mind that comes with a shatter-resistant display.. If you’ve grown accustomed to having a rugged phone over the last few years, the S8 Active is a wonderful step up from your older model. A lot of people hold on to their handsets for 18-24 months; this phone is much improved over what was available at that time.. It's everything you want in a flagship phone, but without the sexiness. Trade off sleek lines and curves for extended battery and peace of mind. It's pricey and exclusive to AT&T (for now), and has a a boring look but it's an excellent option for those who need a rugged, waterproof, smartphone..

http:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=19682. Samsung's Galaxy S8 Active is a rugged version of the company's flagship Android smartphone. If you favor form over function, the Active delivers in spades. It includes all the great features of the S8 and packs them into a far tougher form factor that doesn't require a case. More importantly, the S8 Active makes huge gains in the battery department. Here is Phone Scoop's in-depth review.. The Galaxy S8 Active is a ruggedized version of the Galaxy S8. Though it carries over most of the S8's great features, the S8 Active is a much more robust handset and it includes a significantly bigger battery. If you spend a lot of time outdoors and need a handset that goes like the Energizer bunny on steroids, the S8 Active is one to consider.. Samsung has developed a ruggedized version of its flagship handset each year since the 2013 Galaxy S4 Active. The idea is to create a tougher device that's more able to handle the rigors of daily use by those who don't necessarily sit in cubicles all week long.. From an outward perspective, the S8 Active looks nothing like the S8. Where the S8 is sleek glass, the Active is chunky plastic; where the S8 is the ultimate in hardware refinement, the Active is blunt and a bit of a throwback.. The Active has thick bezels around the screen, a rigid metal frame that wraps around the exterior, a hardened plastic rear panel, and rubber bumpers at the four corners. While it's not quite a brick-shaped device, the S8 Active is blocky and industrial in appearance. I do like the color combinations. Our review unit is is a deep bluish gray with black accents, though a gold option is available too.. The size comparison between the S8 and Active isn't even close. The Active is taller, wider, thicker, and heavier than the S8. The thickness and weight are what disappoint me the most. We're talking 34% heavier, and it's noticeable. You can still fit the Active into most hands and pockets. The S8 Active is still a better fit for hands than the S8+ or Note8, which are both much taller. Just for the heck of it, I put a UAG rugged case on the S8 and it was still smaller and lighter than the Active. There are definitely phones bigger than the Active in the market, though few are heavier.. It's not all metal-and-glass, but you can't ding the Active's build quality nor hardiness. The metal frame encircling the outer edge is thick and crazy strong, the rear panel is hardened plastic, and the glass is protected thanks to a rim formed by the metal frame. It's easy to write off plastic as cheap, but the rear plate of the Active feels like it's bulletproof. All of these components are fitted together tightly; there are no gaps in the seams anywhere. As noted, the phone is semi-rugged (to military specs) for protection against abuse. Apart from the sturdier frame, four rubber bumpers stretched over the four corners provide excellent cushioning in the event of a drop. Samsung says the shatterproof screen should be safe from drops up to 5 feet. Certainly, drops from waist height onto concrete, asphalt, tile, and other surfaces weren't a problem when I tested it.. The curved screen and nearly non-existent bezels are what define the S8's sultry profile. There's nothing svelte about the Active's flat-faced front surface. The bezels surrounding the Active's display are a few millimeters thicker than the S8's all the way around. The result detracts from the idea of the original S8's Infinity Display; the screen may be tall with rounded corners, but the Active looks pretty much like any normal phone. The Active doesn't use physical buttons and instead relies on software controls for the Android system.. Two buttons are located along the Active's left edge. The top button is the volume toggle. It's only about an inch long, which makes it somewhat easy to accidentally press up when you mean to press down, and vice versa. It has a great profile, however, and travel and feedback are excellent. The second button is dedicated to Samsung's Bixby personal assistant tool and it also has good travel and feedback. The lock button is where you expect it to be, on the Active's right edge. It works as well as the other side keys. Samsung tucked the nano SIM and microSD memory card tray in the phone's top edge.. Like the S8, the Active includes a standard headphone jack, USB-C port, and speaker on the bottom edge.. Samsung created some sort of polycarbonate material to form the rear panel of the S8 Active. It has slight ridges along the outer edges and a softer, stone-like pattern across the majority of the flat section. The fingerprint reader and camera array are near the top edge of the phone. The fingerprint reader is placed immediately to the right of the camera module. Everyone griped about the positioning of the fingerprint reader on the S8, myself included. After using the S8 for a while longer, I can tell you you'll get used to it fairly quickly. The one thing that still bugs me is the reader's proximity to the camera module. This ensures you're going to get fingerprints all over the lens, hurting photo quality. That's why the camera app regularly reminds you to wipe the lens clean.. In addition to being rugged, the S8 Active is waterproof, though so is the S8. The two phones share the same IP68 rating, which means you can let the S8 Active sit in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. I tested this and found the phone suffered no damage after spending some time at the bottom of my local river.. The S8 Active forgoes the curved glass of the S8, but still has a 5.8-inch display with an (tall / narrow) 18.5:9 aspect ratio and 2,960 by 1,440 pixels. The Active relies on a Samsung-made Super AMOLED display. The resolution is second-to-none and the S8 Active delivers razor-sharp text, images, and graphics. The display is very bright and easy to use indoors and out. Samsung allows you to dial down the effective screen resolution to save battery life.The middle option is only slightly less amazing than the phone's full resolution. (The middle option is actually the default out of the box.). The full resolution (Quad HD+) is really only necessary for virtual reality. I checked out the S8 Active with Samsung's latest Gear VR headset. The VR experience is excellent, and that's just one of many reasons why the S8 Active is so good.. The shape of the display is well-suited to running two apps at the same time. This split-screen mode does look better on the larger S8+ and Note8, though it's still functional on the S8 Active.. The S8 Active is an AT&T exclusive and it even drops support for some (non-AT&T) LTE bands when compared to the S8, which is a shame. I tested the Galaxy S8 Active on AT&T's network in and around New York City and was mostly impressed.. The S8 Active always remained connected to the network, even when the signal was weak. The phone consistently delivered fast speeds.. The S8 Active was able to connect all calls on the first dial. It maintained calls over long distances at highway speeds, and didn't drop any calls while I tested it. The cellular radio does its job well.. Phone calls made via the S8 Active's earpiece sounded good. I'd rate calls as average when compared to other AT&T handsets. The earpiece delivers clear voices that have a pleasant tone. I didn't have any trouble hearing calls in coffee shops, on city streets, or other noisy spaces. People I spoke to through the phone said I sounded very good.. The S8 Active supports WiFi calling. Setting this service up hardly takes more than a few seconds (as long as your carrier supports it) and delivers a small but noticeable upgrade to audio quality when in use.. During my tests I found I could keep the volume at about 60% for quiet, indoor use, but outdoor noisy spaces require you to crank it up. Distortion mars clarity when you push the volume too much.. Ringers and alerts are loud enough to get your attention, and the vibrate function always made me take notice.. The S8 Active does not include the specially-tuned AKG earbuds that come with the S8, and this is a shame.. Battery life is probably the most important differentiator between the S8 and S8 Active. The Active's battery rates a massive 4,000 mAh, or 33% bigger than that of the S8. (This probably accounts for the lion's share of the Active's weight gain.). The Active delivers superb battery life. The huge power cell pushes through 1.5 days consistently, and sometimes stretched to nearly 2 full days on a single charge. Few mainstream phones available today offer as much battery life. The Active easily outlasts the larger S8+ and Note8.. The S8 Active includes Samsung's trio of power-consumption modes: off, mid, max. Mid reduces some behaviors, and Max really restrains the phone. Moreover, each mode can be customized to a certain degree (tweak brightness, CPU output, notifications, etc.) so you get exactly what you want/need out of them. You can also take control of individual apps to make sure they aren't draining power in the background.. The S8 Active supports Quick Charge 3.0 and rapid wireless charging. It will take longer (than the S8) to charge, however, due to the bigger battery. When plugged into the included wired charger, I found the S8 Active charged from 40% to 100% in 80 minutes. Wireless charging took a bit longer using Samsung's rapid wireless charging pad.. The S8 Active paired with phones, cameras, headsets, speakers, PCs, and other Bluetooth devices without issue. The Bluetooth software made the process painless. Calls sent to mono headsets sounded decent, while calls routed to my car's hands-free system were a bit below-average thanks to some distortion. Music pushed to a stereo speaker sounded amazing.. The GPS radio worked perfectly with Google Maps and other location-based apps. Maps was able to pinpoint me rapidly, and location was as good as 10 feet. The S8 Active makes for a fine point-to-point navigation device.. The S8 Active ships with Samsung Pay, which is one of many apps that can take advantage of the phone's NFC. The S8 Active is also compatible with Android Pay. I mostly used the NFC radio to assist in pairing with Bluetooth accessories, which it did well.. Last, the Galaxy S8 Active packs dual-band 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac WiFi. This means the S8 Active is compatible with faster versions of WiFi.. As the end of the year approaches so too does the season of giving. Holiday gifting lists are often filled with technology, but it isn't always easy to find that perfect item.. FCC Approves What Is Likely the Samsung Galaxy S8 Active.

I just purchased the Galaxy S8 Active, and all I'm seeing online is it's not compatible with Samsung VR, which I have from last Christmas, and it's absolutely not compatible.

SpaceX’s biggest rival has a ‘genius’ plan to cut its rocket launch costs more than 70%. Tech Insider Samsung just .... Samsung just announced a more durable version of its Galaxy S8 smartphone with a bigger battery. Jeff Dunn , Business Insider US. The Galaxy S8 Active is a tougher version of Samsung’s best phone. Samsung on Monday officially announced the Galaxy S8 Active, a more rugged version of its flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone .. The phone will be exclusive to AT&T, but only “for a limited time.” It’ll be available to preorder on Tuesday, with a full release on Friday.. AT&T says the device will cost $28.34 a month in a 30-month payment plan or $850.20 outright.. As various leaks had suggested , the Galaxy S8 Active ditches the curved sides of the standard Galaxy S8 for a flatter, more traditional design. The display itself is the same as before – which is a good thing – but the bezels around it are more pronounced.. Most notably, the Galaxy S8 Active comes coated in a thicker frame with metal sides and a polycarbonate material on the back. The makes the phone a bit heftier than the standard Galaxy S8, but Samsung says it allows the device to meet military-grade durability standards. The company says the phone is water-resistant, too, and that its display can survive drops from up to 5 feet.. The point is that the S8 Active shouldn’t fall apart if you rough it up a bit, though we’ll have to test it to be sure.. The other noteworthy change should be battery life: Samsung says the Galaxy S8 Active comes with a 4,000-mAh battery, which is significantly larger than the 3,000-mAh battery in the regular model.. Beyond that, you’re looking at just about the same phone as before. The device still runs on Qualcomm’s fastest processor, the Snapdragon 835, with the same 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of expandable storage. The top-notch cameras are still here, too, and the fingerprint scanner is still awkwardly near the top of the phone’s back.. There also remains a button dedicated to activating Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant. Previous Galaxy S Active phones have included a button that can be custom-mapped to various shortcuts, but here you’re stuck with the assistant that Business Insider’s Steve Kovach recently deemed “half-baked.”. Since this is a carrier exclusive for the time being, there’ll also be some apps preloaded onto the phone – AT&T says its DirecTV Now streaming service will be included, for one.. All of this means the Galaxy S8 Active should be plenty powerful, but it’s still fairly expensive for a phone that gives up the standard S8’s signature feature, that curved design. Nevertheless, if you want a high-end phone and don’t want to bother with a case, the S8 Active may be worth a look..

Galaxy S7 Active: Rugged smartphone shootout. A good rugged phone is hard to find. A good rugged phone that doesn’t sacrifice performance, even harder. Fortunately, Samsung has been a leader in the segment with its Galaxy S Active series of phones. Last year’s Galaxy S7 Active. retained everything we loved about the regular Galaxy S7 — the fantastic camera, lightning-fast processor, and gorgeous display — while beefing up the battery, drop protection, and water resistance.. Thankfully, Samsung appears to have taken the same approach with the Galaxy S8 Active. The result is a tried-and-true flagship that doesn’t skimp on anything to deliver the most durability in the segment. Read on to find out how the S8 Active stacks up against its predecessor.. 151.9 x 74.9 x 9.9mm (5.98 x 2.95 x 0.39 in). 148.8 x 74.9 x 9.9 mm (5.86 x 2.95 x 0.39 in). 5.8-inch Quad HD+ Super AMOLED flat. 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi. 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi. 12MP rear with OIS, 8MP front. 12MP rear with OIS, 5MP front.

Camo Green, Titanium Gray, Sandy Gold. $850, or $28.34 per month for 30 months. $695, or $23 per month for 17 months. The S7 Active was at the bleeding edge of mobile hardware last year, and the same is true of the S8 Active today. The S8 Active has a newer Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. It features the same 4GB of RAM as last year’s model, though the amount of internal storage has seen a sizable bump: 64GB, up from 32GB in the S7 Active. Both phones feature MicroSD slots for expansion up to an additional 256GB.. To tip the scales even further in the S8 Active’s favor, the new model features Bluetooth 5.0. The S7 Active made do with only version 4.2, which has half the data transfer speed, and cannot pair to more than one device at a time.. In terms of power and performance, there’s really no contest. The Galaxy S7 Active would still be plenty fast for just about anyone, but the S8 Active is simply a generation ahead.. Where design is concerned, the S8 Active is the more attractive handset, at least head-on. Although the screen isn’t curved on the S8 Active, presumably for durability concerns, it covers significantly more surface area than the S7 Active’s did. The bezels are quite slim on every side for such a rugged device, but the S8 Active is only a bit taller than its predecessor. In terms of width and thickness, they’re exactly the same.. That larger 18.5:9 screen comes at a price — the S7 Active’s physical navigation buttons are nowhere to be found on the new model. Aesthetically, it’s a good look — but if you’re in a line of work where you’re interested in the S8 Active to begin with, the lack of a tactile, clickable interface may inhibit usability with gloves.. For that reason, it’s hard to recommend the S8 Active lock, stock, and barrel over its predecessor in the design department. In other respects, both have the typical hallmarks of a rugged phone: Textured surfaces, cushioned corners, unnecessary molding along the sides, and, in the S8 Active’s case, screws that serve no obvious purpose. They’re not as garish as they could be, but they make for a phone that is no match for the svelte,. classic S8 , or for that matter the HTC U11 , LG G6 , or iPhone 7 .. While durability is probably the Active’ series foremost consideration, the S8 Active doesn’t seem to be any better at taking a beating than its predecessor. That’s not to say it’s not tough — simply that improvements haven’t really been made.. Both phones are rated IP68 water and dust resistant. If you drop either in the pool, they’ll survive for 30 minutes, at a depth of 5 feet. Both adhere to the MIL-STD-810G military equipment standard, meaning they can withstand a variety of environmental conditions and physical trauma that would demolish lesser devices. And both feature “shatter-resistant” displays, according to Samsung, as well as shock-absorbing corners to weather drops. No matter which Active you choose, you’ll be equally protected against the elements.. The real difference between the displays in each of these phones is the size. Whereas the Galaxy S7 Active featured a 5.1-inch panel with a conventional 16:9 aspect ratio and a resolution of 2560 x 1440, the S8 Active’s is bigger and sharper. At 5.8 inches, it fills up far more real estate on the front, making the body feel surprisingly compact. The 18.5:9 aspect ratio leads to a taller screen when you’re holding it in portrait mode, and the resolution has been improved to 2960 x 1440 for those extra pixels at the top and bottom. Both devices utilize AMOLED technology, delivering rich blacks and vibrant colors. In a nod to the regular S8, the S8 Active’s panel features rounded corners — although it lacks the futuristic, sloping edges.. Whereas the standard S7 had a 3,000mAh battery, Samsung bumped the capacity to 4,000mAh for the S7 Active. It has taken the exact same approach this time around. Both the S7 Active and S8 Active feature large 4,000mAh batteries, good for at least a day-and-a-half of use, with the potential to go beyond that.. Although the sizes are equal, the S8 Active’s 835 chipset is said to be 25 percent more efficient than the outgoing 820 found in the S7 Active. This would give a slight edge in battery life to the newer model. Fortunately, both devices support Samsung’s quick charging protocol as well as wireless charging , so topping up those big batteries shouldn’t take too long. However, the S8 Active features a USB Type-C connector, while the S7 Active makes do with Micro USB. The latter isn’t quite as fast, isn’t reversible, and can’t serve as many different purposes.. The photography experience is another area where there’s very little separating the S7 Active and S8 Active. Last year’s device basically carried over the regular S7’s 12-megapixel rear shooter, which we found to be excellent in testing. That camera was mostly unchanged moving to the S8, and it’s been preserved in the S8 Active. The only difference is the front-facing camera, which benefits from an 8-megapixel sensor, compared to five in the S7 range.. While extremely good, the cameras could always be improved. Samsung has received serious competition from Apple and Google in this space over the last year, so perhaps it’ll be time for a serious upgrade when the Galaxy S9 rolls around. Regardless, whichever Active device you choose, you’ll get a similar camera experience on par with the best flagships. Selfie fans will want the S8 Active.. The S8 Active includes Bixby , Samsung’s new virtual assistant. In theory, Bixby should be a huge part of Samsung’s TouchWiz Android experience, making every task a bit easier. In practice, however, it just isn’t that useful yet. Even with Bixby Voice finally releasing in English after months of delays, there’s very little reason right now you’d use it instead of, say, Google Assistant.. Bixby was supposed to be Samsung’s defining new feature. Without it, you’re looking at two very similar phones from a software perspective. Both Active devices feature a subsection of mini-apps called the Activity Zone , which acts as a portal to lots of outdoorsy tools and information, like the flashlight, stopwatch, compass, and barometer. If you’re interested in a rugged smartphone to begin with, you’ll probably find it somewhat useful — but it exists on both the S8 Active and S7 Active, so you’re not forced to choose.. Both the S7 Active and S8 Active are unfortunately AT&T carrier exclusives, so if you’re on another network, you’re out of luck. The S8 Active runs $850 at launch, while the S7 Active has dropped down to $700 after a year on the market. The S8 Active costs $50 more than its predecessor did when it was new.. So the availability is equally poor for both phones, and the S8 Active demands a $150 premium for the latest tech. AT&T does have a couple of. promotions going on to lessen the blow, like the ability to receive up to $200 for trading in an eligible device. If you can string them together, the S8 Active begins to make more sense — though on price alone, it loses this battle.. Great as the Galaxy S7 Active was, the newer model benefits from a next-gen, state-of-the-art processor and a nearly full-screen display. In terms of its ruggedness, the S8 Active doesn’t offer a significant upgrade — but if you want a phone that doesn’t cut back on power and performance to deliver best-in-class durability, look no further than Samsung’s latest..
