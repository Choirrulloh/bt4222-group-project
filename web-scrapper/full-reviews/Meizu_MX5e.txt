Meizu MX5E debuts in China with slightly watered down specs, lower price than the MX5. Earlier today we found out that the upcoming Meizu m3 note is going to cost CNY 1,099 ($169 or 148 at the current exchange rates), and now it's time for another bit of news regarding a Meizu smartphone.. This one is called the MX5E, and it's actually a new variation of the MX5 that has been released last year. It's slightly lower-end and also cheaper by a little, in fact.. Meizu has launched the MX5E in China without an official announcement or anything of the sort. It can be found in stores starting at CNY 1,399, which is about $215 or 189. Apparently that's CNY 100 ($15, 13) cheaper than the normal MX5.. However, the device you're getting comes with a 16 MP main camera (down from 20.7 MP), as well as a lower-clocked processor. Whereas the one inside the MX5 can go up to 2.2 GHz, in the MX5E it's only capable of reaching 2 GHz - 10% less, as it turns out. Otherwise, the MX5E is identical to the MX5, but it's unclear whether the paltry savings here actually make the performance hit worth it.. Another mystery is whether Meizu will ever sell the MX5E outside of China. That's not the case for now.. Source 1  Source 2. Meizu VP says Meizu X2 smartphone is real, will have a Snapdragon 845.

This new 'lite' version of the Meizu MX5E - would like to know if it has LTE band 7 (2600). Meizu blundered by putting only Bands 1 and 3 on the MX5, confusing many Chinese retailers who just assumed it would have band 7. They need to make it with Snapdragon 650.

Meizu will release Meizu MX5E and Meizu M3 Note smartphone in April. By FumiJ , Senior Member on 6th April 2016, 04:40 AM. In April, there are many Chinese smartphones to be released. For example, Meizu is ready to release Meizu M3 note and Meizu MX5E smartphone, both of them enjoy high attention among the customers. Let's talk about Meizu m3 note first:. From leaks so far we have discovered that the new Meizu M3 Note will feature a new all alloy body rather than plastic, we have also seen that the budget smartphone could also have a fingerprint scanner in the home button, a 5.5-inch display, and Mediatek Helio P10 chipset plus larger 3500mA battery. All these features sound great, but don’t they also sound very similar to what the Meizu Metal range offers?. Second, Let's see how it is powerful about Meizu MX5E?. Compared to the regular Meizu MX5, the MX5E is 100 Yuan cheaper, and has a few downgrades to cut the pricing, one being the drop in processing speed from 2.2Ghz to 2.0Ghz and a reduction in mega-pixels for the rear camera to 16 mega-pixel (down from 21MP). Unchanged is the 5.5-inch 1920 x 1080 display, all metal body, 3GB RAM , 5 mega-pixel front camera, fingerprint scanner and 3150mAh battery. Therefore, which one will you want to experience first? As it's known to all, Apple has release iphone SE version which enjoys great popularity now. So Meizu has also taken the same way to use the name of iphone. I hope Meizu will not let us disappointed in its price and hardware, and software. Honor 8 Pro and Honor 9 Now Officially Receiving the Android Oreo Update >.

Type Design Type called form factor refers to a mobile phone's size, shape, and style as well as the layout and position of major components of phone. There are three major form factors seen in mobile phones => bar phones, folding phones and sliding phones.. 149.9 x 74.7 x 7.6 mm. Display Type Display Technology => A number of display technologies and types used in mobile phones => TFT (Thin Film Transistor), IPS (In-Place Switching), OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode), AMOLED (Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode), Super AMOLED (an even advanced version of AMOLED), Resistive Touchscreen (Resistive touchscreens contain two layer of conductive material with a very small gap between them which acts as a resistance), Capacitive Touchsceen (Capacitive touchscreen technology consists of a layer of glass coated with a transparent conductor). Display Colors Display Colors is refers to the number of different shades of colors that the screen is capable of displaying => 64K colors, 256K colors and 16 million colors, Obviously 16M is highest available range of colors and better than others.. Pixel Density Pixel Density (PPI) is refers to the concentration of pixels on a particular display, measured in pixels per inch (ppi). Pixel density is calculated by dividing the diagonal pixel resolution of a display by its diagonal size, higher pixel density better display quality.. Display Protection Display Protection => Gorilla Glass is a special alkali-aluminosilicate glass shield with exceptional damage resistance that helps protect mobile displays from scratches, drops, and bumps of everyday use, It is always better to go for a smartphone with Gorilla Glass for that added protection and peace of mind.. GPU GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a single-chip processor designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display, This includes things such as lighting effects, object transformations, and 3D motion.. RAM (Memory) RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly, any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes that allows information to be stored and accessed quickly from random locations. RAM is the most common type of memory found in computer systems, smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices.. Internal Storage Internal Storage is a data storage space (flash memory) mostly used in smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices where operating system, apps, music, photos, videos, files and other user data Is stored.. Memory Card Slot Memory Card Slot is a special slot for inserting a memory card. Memory cards allow you to expand the phone's built-in memory, A memory card (sometimes called a flash memory card or a storage card) is a small storage medium used to store data such as text, pictures, audio, and video, for use on small, portable or remote computing devices such as mobile phones, mp3 players, digital cameras.. Sensors Sensors are electronic components that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The specific input could be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure and location, The output is generally a signal that is converted to use in computing systems, a location sensor, such as a GPS receiver is able to detect current location of your electronic device.. Operating System OS => Every computer system run on a base software called Operating System (OS). Operating System controls all basic operations of the computer (such as smartphone, PDAs, tablet computers and other handheld devices). The Operating System allows the user to install and run third party applications (apps), apps are used to add new functionality to the device.. User Interface UI or user interface of a device is the look and feel of the on-screen menu system. How it works, its color scheme, how it responds to button presses, all of these things are part of the user interface.. Rear Camera Camera is able to capture photographs and usually videos, The most important characteristics of a camera are the resolution (measured in megapixels), lens focus type (fixed or automatic), higher megapixel cameras are known to capture higher quality photos, but not always a good measurement of the photos quality.. Flash Flash Light => There is commonly two types of flash lights are used in camera mobile phones, LED Flash (LED flash offers lower power consumption with drive circuitry that takes up very little room, LEDs can be strobed faster than any other light source), Xenon Flash (xenon flash produces an extremely intense full-spectrum white light for a very short duration). SIM SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) is a small card that contains mobile network subscriber's account information. This allows the phone using the card to attach to a mobile network. The SIM card is most commonly associated with GSM and UMTS mobile networks. Moving a SIM card from one phone to another allows a subscriber to switch mobile phones without having to contact their mobile network carrier. SIM cards can also be used by a phone to store limited amounts of data, such as phone numbers and text messages..
