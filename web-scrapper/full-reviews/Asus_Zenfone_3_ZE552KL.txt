There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars This is a great phone with affordable cost. This is a great phone with affordable cost. I don't mind the bloat wares as long as they help keep the cost down. Just remove or ignore the bloat wares. I like the Power and Boost button that release unused memory instantly. It works great with official ASUS flip cover case. Simply close cover to put into sleep and open cover to wake it up. (I don't use the fingerprint security). There are flip cover cases by other manufacturers, but be aware that not all of them can make phone sleep/wake automatically.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars The camera is not so good, and I thought it would be better. The phone is very fast, well built, the battery lasts at least 18h with a lot of use (amazing). Fingerprint sensor is really fast and precise. The camera is not so good, and I thought it would be better. With a little bit of zoom you can perceive a lot of noise even with good light..

I was an Iphone user and just decided to switch for once. I'm not gonna lie, it is a pain in the ass going from apple to android, but in general, I don't see much difference in how they operate, the only big difference would be the price. I bought my Asus about 6 months ago and I'm the sound isn't working properly and there is no warranty, so I felt pretty frustrated about that. Would I buy this product again? Maybe, it is cheap, that's the only reason why I consider buying it again, but I'm sure there are many other options out there with a similar price that will provide you a warranty.. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Who has been doing Pro reviews must be getting paid by ASUS. I'll update with another review later. Only really has 1 good thing going for it. Speaker is very week no matter what manufacturer and others say. This cell also DOES get 4glte in the USA using cricket. ZEN 3 doesn't have a lte icon. If u have nano SIM, use micro adapter to use that SIM slot. By dialing *#*#4636#*#* will show u that your signal type is LTE.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars excellent camera for photography (videography seems to be giving me .... The phone is very powerful, tons of storage, excellent camera for photography (videography seems to be giving me trouble, but that's probably user error more than anything), and has a very responsive screen and fingerprint scanner. The one downside is the amount of bloatware that comes packaged with it. There are apps you cannot uninstall (only disable them) and they are numerous. The screen does seem prone to scratching, as I've only had the phone for two or three weeks and it already suffered a series of small aesthetic scratches just from simply putting in my pocket. Cases are few and far between with this phone. You can really only use an ASUS ZenFone 3 case with it, as your average store does not carry Zenfone cases and there do not appear to be one-size-fits-all versions Overall, an excellent phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Cellular network connection problems. I used the Zenfone 3 for one year now. I loved it so much value for a good price. Does everything a phone should, would be the best phone I ever purchased except for the last month they had a update, and now phone calls drop every five minutes. Making the main priority of having a phone to take calls useless. Other every other aspect of it it was amazing, but the problem with the drop calls made me never want to buy an Asus phone again.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Works as expected, I have lots of internal storage .... Works as expected, I have lots of internal storage and the capability to add additional storage via a Micro SD card. I am interested in checking out the Dual Sim Card feature of the phone. Looking forward to using the Zenfone 3 as my primary phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars This phone has failed in the worst area.. At first this phone seemed to deliver however after prolonged usage there are a few things that make this phone a bad buy, a small issue is its glass body, not a big deal but the glass is extremely fragile don't use without a case, but the big problem that makes this phone a bad investment is that after a few months you camera (Rear) will start to have problems focusing so pictures and video will always be blurry, anything like depositing checks will become impossible, checked online to see if this was just the case with my device turns out it has this problem in a large amount of devices, features are great but what is a smart phone without a camera.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. very nice smart phone, low cost and excellent cel phone. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. great phone but didnt work so great here in usa on 4g. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 4.0 out of 5 stars Four Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars.

More Images – Click on image below to see color specific images:. The Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) is the mid range offering from this years Asus Zenfone line-up. This model is 5.5-inch, but Asus also offers a smaller 5.2-inch Zenfone 3 (ZE520KL) model which shares the same specs but just in a smaller size. The ZE552KL offers solid build quality, specs and price. It’s built to offer the best value in this price range of phones.. At the time of this review, the availability is a curious thing in North America. The US market does not have either the ZE552KL or the ZE520KL. The Canadian market however does have the ZE552KL available.. In case you are in the US and are wondering why you cannot get this phone, we don’t have an exact answer. According to Asus the situation is unlikely to change. So if you live in the US and want this Zenfone 3 model, you will need to look at Canadian retailers (like Amazon.ca or eBay sellers) who ship this North American variant to the US. Your other option in the US is to look at the. Zenfone 3 Deluxe 5.5-inch (ZS550KL) which is significantly different looking and but maintains a mid range price compared to the other Zenfone 3 series offerings.. Asus has a proven track record on innovation thanks to great engineers and design teams. If you look across the entire Zenfone 3 line-up, they deserve some real credit on what they have achieved. The evolution from Zenfone 2 to Zenfone 3 is remarkable in terms of design and looks.. The Zenfone 3 is a beautiful smartphone. The Gorilla glass which covers the front and rear gives this phone a real precious look. Having glass surrounding a smartphone is not a common design and in terms of uniqueness, Asus scores big here.. There are a couple concerns though when handling the Zenfone 3. The back of the phone gives it a sense of fragility. For example, placing this glass backed phone on surfaces does cause concerns of scratching. Additionally we found the full glass design to be slippery and slick. Sure that means without a case or cover it can slide nicely and easily into a pocket, but by the same token it also means that it can slide out just as easily.. So from a cosmetic perspective, the design looks gorgeous. However from a practical viewpoint, this phone needs some protection on it because a drop on the glass backing will result in dire consequences. Gorilla Glass sounds great in theory, but it’s not armor. It’s not going to save this phone from cracking badly and we’ve seen evidence of this from a YouTube drop test. Additionally a case or cover will give it some needed grip.. The design on the front of the Zenfone 3 gives a hint of the Samsung Edge design, but the curvature is far less dramatic or noticeable. This is a good thing in our books because the Samsung Edge design is dramatic and seems gimicky. Asus refers to this design as a 2.5D display because of this curved edge effects utilizing Gorilla Glass on the front and rear.. The chrome trim looks sharp and accents both the edges and camera hump on the rear of the phone. Sand blasted edges make it super smooth to handle. It’s not clever marketing when Asus touts the smooth edges. When I first put the Zenfone 3 in my hand, it definitely feels light and thin. It’s very comfortable to hold with the rounded edges and the glass build gives it a slick feeling. I’ve been used to a Nexus 5 which has a more tacky feel which made me realize that the Zenfone 3 in its bare form could be slippery in the wrong pocket.. The volume rocker and power button are on the right side of the Zenfone 3. People in other reviews have made mention of the Zen like “concentric circle” design on these buttons. Big deal? Well the fact is the buttons are grooved with those circles. You can feel the ridges under finger which give a more solid and less slippery response. Asus really deserved some props here on a nice looking and premium design and feel. People have voiced some displeasure about the price increases from Zenfone 2 to Zenfone 3, but the reality is the design has truly evolved. It’s very unique and thought out. In a way it’s a shame to cover up a lot of the subtle design features with a bumper case which so many of us end up doing.. The model we are reviewing is actually called Dark Blue or Sapphire Black depending on what spec sheet or website you’re looking at. The reality is that in North America, this color model is being sold as Dark Blue even though on the Asus website there is no such color listed. There are three colors listed on the Asus website which include White, Gold and Black (which is actually Dark Blue). Most markets will not get all three colors. In Canada the Dark Blue and White colors are available.. The box contents of the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) includes a headset, USB-C charge cable and power adapter, sim card tool, phone serial and IMEI number stickers and tiny users manual. If you want to actually read a real user’s manual with more in-depth information, then you will need to download the PDF which we have for you here .. On first boot up there are the typical greeting pages and setup requirements. If you want to utilize the free 100GB Google online storage you can set that up during the initial setup. Additionally, there is a wizard if you already have an Android phone and want to easily transfer everything to this Zenfone 3.. When you first start using the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) you are greeted with a number of quick tip tutorial pop ups. Most of these can be easily skipped, but it is an annoyance albeit a short live one. The operating system only prompts the tutorials on first run so it’s not an ongoing issue. Depending on your level of comfort with Android and Asus devices, these tutorial may actually be considered a benefit rather than a hassle.. The Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) runs Android 6.0 along with ZenUI 3.0. We will get deeper into ZenUI 3.0 later in this review, but for now think of this as a layer of the operating system that Asus added to Android. It’s a deeper amount of settings, customizations and personalizations than the pure Android OS provides.. If you fear a mid range processor like the Snapdragon 625, don’t. Performance is snappy and the 4GB of RAM rounds out the competent hardware inside the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL). Under heavy loads the phone runs colder than many of its counterparts. I’ve seen some comparison temperature testing and the ZE552KL runs cooler than most which helps maintain a good battery life.. The capacitive navigation buttons like “home”, “back” and “recent apps” are not back lit, but you can see the buttons are clear to see with the silver on black. The Zenfone 3 comes with a fingerprint sensor which is located on the back of the phone. One shortcoming with the fingerprint sensor is the location. For example when you place the phone on a table you can’t access the fingerprint sensor without picking up the phone. Not a deal breaker, but an inconvenience for sure.. If you look at most polls, the most valued aspect of a smartphone is a cheap price followed by battery life. Where is the love for a great display?. After using the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) for good amount of time, I found the display as strongest aspect of the phone. It’s the level of brightness where this display really impresses. If you dare to max out the brightness, the screen really pops.. With a resolution of 1920 x 1080 it’s not at the top of class 2560 x 1440 level, but the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) does share the same resolution as the popular iPhone 7 Plus. If it’s good enough for Apple then it should be good enough for Asus right?. To give a technical look at brightness, let’s look at nits ratings. If you look at the competing smartphones, they are top end, premium priced flagship models. With the much cheaper price of the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) it’s impressive to get such a quality display.. The Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) comes with a 5-magnet single mono speaker. Asus claims that the speaker design fetches a 40% performance improvement. I can verify that the speaker provides crisp clear sound without distortion. It can also provide more than enough volume for most environments.. Having a mono speaker versus a pair of stereo speakers should not be a deal breaker. Look no further than other flagship smartphones from Samsung and Apple that also make use of a single mono speaker. Given the speaker location on the bottom end of the phone there would ultimately be very little stereo separation and even then the audio is directed out the sides of the phone and not towards your ears. Headsets and external speakers are for when sound is of the utmost importance.. I used various external audio accessories including portable Bluetooth speakers, headsets and headphones. Under those scenarios the Zenfone 3 performed very well. In fact the built in Asus Audio Wizard app provides great functionality and scope of sound when you are using an external audio solution.. With the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) having a mid ranged Snapdragon S625 processor, Asus was hoping for solid battery life performance. After using the phone over a good amount of time I can verify Asus achieved their goal.. First let’s talk about charge times. There is some misinformation about the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) having a quick charge technology. When you look at my findings in terms of charge times you will see that quick charge technology is not essential.. Standby time is another aspect of battery life that is sometimes overlooked. In my tests, for a 8-hour overnight period I would see around a 3% battery drop. This is a typical scenario with the phone making use of wifi and in a normal performance mode. There are a number of variables involved and if you leave apps open then the battery is going to lose more than 3% in an 8-hour period of time.. Asus does include some nice power saving options. If you have a set sleep schedule, you can go into the settings and have the phone enter a more robust power saving mode via a timed schedule. You can also simply set the phone to use a “Power saving” or “Super saving” mode. Using these specialized saving modes you get through 8-hours without losing a percentage of battery life.. When it comes to battery life performance for watching video and playing games, I set up some typical scenarios. One set of tests would use full brightness with a second test under the same conditions except with brightness down to 50 percent. It’s worth mentioning that you could very easily go lower than 50 percent brightness in dim environments which will decrease battery consumption even more.. Gaming tests were conducted by playing graphically intensive and performance demanding games. These results are essentially a worst case scenario. If you prefer light gaming then your battery consumption will be far less significant that these test results.. If you need a smartphone to get you through a day, the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) is going to serve you well. With a few heavy tasks and a lot of light tasks like social media and internet usage, I found the battery life to be very good. I never had situations where I was scrambling for a charge during a day.. If you need the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) to last beyond a day under heavy use, then reducing brightness to 50% is a very reasonable solution. With the super bright display, being at 50% is still quite bright. If done right you can dim the screen while still maintaining functionality. With reduced screen brightness you can cut battery consumption by around half in comparison to running at full brightness.. The Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow along with the Asus ZenUI 3.0 integration. At the time of writing this review, Asus has already made moves on the Android 7.0 Nougat update and it was available in the Philippines market. Asus has since paused the rollout to fix bugs and issues. However it’s apparent that the Android 7.0 update is right around the corner.. Asus has taken a lot of hits in the PR department regarding bloatware. It’s obviously a very touchy subject with consumers. Aside from the “pure” Google phones, every other smartphone out there has some sort of modified Android operating system.. Companies integrate some of their own apps and customization into Android. This is an industry standard but Asus took on some bad press with the Zenfone 2 pre installed apps situation.. With the Zenfone 3 series it does appear Asus listened to their customer base. However a certain amount of stigma still exists. Other Zenfone 3 reviews out there are critical of the bloatware on these phones and largely I would suggest this is a misleading criticism.. I went through every pre installed Asus app on the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) and you could disable them all and a few you can uninstall completely. Sure, it takes about 5 minutes to disable the apps but after that’s done, there is no clutter. You can make the apps pages bare. You can have just the Google apps on this phone if you so choose to do so.. Here is the truth of the matter. A lot of the pre installed Asus apps are excellent and there is no need to disable or remove them. The only app that requires a slightly less conventional disabling is the “Game Genie” but even then it’s just a matter of going into your settings to disable it. The majority of pre installed apps on the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) are perfectly fine.. If customization and personalization is important to you, then you will enjoy the Asus ZenUI 3.0 capabilities. Themes, wallpapers, fonts and other aspect can be altered to your liking. Asus has a simple theme store which provides a nifty preview mode. If you like a bland or clean viewing experience, no problem. If you want to dazzle your eyes with a unique looking operating system you can certainly do that too.. If there is one complaint about ZenUI 3.0 it’s in the layers of options or redundancies. There are many different paths to the same end point. For example, the swipe down quick launch menu is very handy but there are far too many apps listed and no option to reduce the icons. A little bit more flexibility could help lighten the load in ZenUI 3.0 and allow for less clutter. If you compare to a pure Google Android OS experience, you will see that less can be more.. Check out the two screenshots of the Quick Settings menu which is found by swiping down on the screen. The second screenshot shows some of the options that you can add to the menu. There are even more options than what you see in the screenshot if you scroll each section. Asus divided these into “items” and “tools” and you are stuck selecting a certain number of each. You cannot reduce the number of items/tools unfortunately.. It’s nice to have good flexibility in the Quick settings menu, but there are a lot of icons and there are some items that are necessary in my opinion.. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen. A swipe from the bottom of the screen can bring up another quick launch style menu. Although at first this may seem like a redundancy, the bottom swipe menu is actually more convenient when holding the phone. Rather than needing two hands to get into system settings, the bottom swipe menu is easier to manage with one hand.. I think it’s also prudent to mention that Asus has provided a good number of firmware updates to improve the phone. These regular firmware updates can improve camera performance or other optimization related improvements. Asus has rolled out 12 firmware updates since July 2016. But obviously the software update everyone wants is the Android 7.0 Nougat update and that appears to be on the cusp of being released globally. By February 2017 is should be available in all markets.. Overall, ZenUI 3.0 is a plus and not a negative. It adds some personality to an otherwise bland Android experience. As for the criticism you may read on other reviews or in comment sections, I would suggest taking those with a grain of salt. I believe a lot of the criticism you may read about the Asus Zenfone series is dated and not accurate. A lot of reviews don’t delve into ZenUI 3.0 deeply enough to see just how many Asus apps can be disabled or removed.. As a mid ranged phone, the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) has average, if not higher than average benchmark results. Gleaming insights from benchmarks is also a big difficult. More expensive mobile phones have the best Snapdragon processors and these are the phones that top the benchmark results. A more expensive device that has the top end hardware is going to be at the top of benchmark results and mid ranged hardware is going to fetch mid level benchmark results as a comparison.. PCMark for Android – Work Performance 1.0. PCMark for Android – Work Performance 2.0. When you crunch the overall findings, the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) is right in the midst of the expensive flagship phones that were released in 2015. Also in no benchmark comparison did the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) fail miserably. The overall benchmark results suggest the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) is a solid performer.. Asus touts the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) as “Built for Photography”. Specs wise, the rear camera is a 16MP Sony IMX 298 sensor with a front facing 8MP camera. The rear camera is capable of video recording up to 4K (3840 x 2160) at 30 frames per second.. If you look at some of the photo samples featured on the Asus.com website then there is something to what they are suggesting. However if you’re like me, the world of manual camera settings can be overwhelming. Thankfully Asus comes to the rescue and includes some nifty presets and easy to use functionality for people who are not expert photographers.. After using the Zenfone 3 camera in a variety of situation and environments we were most impressed with the quick laser focus. Asus employs the touch focus technology which is common among smartphones. With close up photos, choosing a focal point with create blur or a depth of field quality to the photos. When dealing with challenging lighting, touching on the screen in different places can help you quickly fetch the best lighting for the photo.. The video capturing capabilities of the Zenfone 3 are impressive. You can take up to 4K video but it’s the stabilization technology that really makes the video shine. There is far less shake than what you might expect from a smartphone camera. An added bonus is that you can take still photos while recording video.. I mentioned the Asus camera presets earlier. In total there are 18 presets, including manual mode. We spent some time experimenting with the various presets and our favorite was “Depth of Field”. This preset makes objects in the background blur while keeping your foreground subject in focus. This is particularly helpful when taking close-ups of flowers or other object that you want to be central in a photo. If there is a photo effect you can think of, Asus pretty much has it covered with one of their presets. This is a perfect solution for those of us, including me that need a helping hand when trying to get the best possible photos.. By default you aren’t going to get the biggest or highest quality images or videos. I needed to go into settings and make a few tweaks just to ensure I was getting the best possible results. It’s always curious the decision making when it comes to setting defaults. It makes one wonder what other reviewers are using in terms of their settings.. When shooting outdoors I found best results with the HDR Mode enabled. You can see in these two images the difference and accuracy of the sky. The HDR Mode photo keeps the definition of the sky intact whereas the regular mode photo washed out the details in the sky and clouds.. Selfie cameras are important these days, and here are a few sample photos. Best results were outdoors which shouldn’t be surprising. I enjoy my privacy so I snapped some selfies using American Girl dolls.. Late afternoon, sun setting, auto mode. Below is an photo using my favorite preset mode, “Depth of Field”. You can achieve a dSLR effect with this preset and this works ideally in bright lighting conditions. In some low light indoor situations a bit of patience is required and you may not get the perfect shot on first try.. We are quickly approaching that stage where the hardware exceeds the demands that we are placing on it. The point being that current day hardware is capable of handling the demands of most people. Heck, even phones that are two years old can still manage most every task and app. Yes you can pay more for something even faster, but the compromise is that battery life will take a hit for that higher performance.. Calling this a mid ranged smartphone may imply shortcomings but don’t be fooled. With 4GB of RAM and a Snapdragon S625 (2.0GHz) the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) is going to be sufficient for most everyone. The hardware isn’t the big selling point of this smartphone but it’s certainly not a liability either.. Asus has an incredible design team and the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) is a gorgeous smartphone. The only issue I have is that it’s very fragile and slippery. As a result, a protective case is virtually mandatory. Given the fact the phone looks great I would recommend getting a clear case only. Why cover up something that looks so good?. Asus has taken a bad wrap in the past with pre installed apps (bloatware) on their Zenfone 2 models. With the updated Asus ZenUI 3.0 the fear of bloatware is largely overrated. I was able to quickly disable the Asus apps which put them out of sight, out of mind. However some of the Asus apps are excellent and are completely worth keeping and using. If you prefer the Google apps, those can be installed and used instead. You are not locked into Asus apps at all. So if software concerns you about the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) it shouldn’t.. Apprehension about future Android updates and the timing of those updates is a legitimate concern. Take comfort in knowing that Asus has already begun rolling out of Android 7.0 Nougat for their Zenfone 3 series. By the time you are reading this review, it’s entirely likely that the ZE552KL has the Android 7.0 Nougat update. Expect a global update to roll out in February 2017.. All in all, the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL) hits the mark in terms of price, hardware and looks. It’s an affordable unlocked smartphone that won’t break the bank yet it has a flagship quality design and feel.. More Photos of the Zenfone 3 (ZE552KL):. Shop Now For A Zenfone 4:.

Although Asus has already unveiled the ZenFone 3 line, new leaks suggest a variant with a Snapdragon 821 processor is also in the works.. Asus made big waves in 2015 with the ZenFone 2 line of devices, which were incredibly popular last year. Their follow-up effort, the ZenFone 3, was unveiled during Asus' Zenvolution event last May, but we still don't know exactly what the specifications of all the devices will be.. However, new information suggests that at least one of the variants of ZenFone 3 will have an interesting stat: 6GB of RAM. The leak is a shot from what looks like a brochure from an Asus event. It also states that the Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe (model ZS570KL) will have an impressive Snapdragon 821 processor, 6GB of RAM, an Adreno 540 graphics processor, 600Mbps 4G LTE (CAT 13) and a USB-Type C connector.. In addition, an Asus teaser with the #Z3N hashtag shows a large number six on the ground, suggesting the device will have 6GB of RAM.. While the ZenFone 3 line was revealed at Zenvolution, this is the first we are hearing of the Snapdragon 821 variant. The information revealed at Asus' event suggest a Snapdragon 820 powered ZenFone 3.. Other than the leaked images, other information suggests that the device will have a 5.7-inch Full HD display (1080p), 128GB to 256GB of internal storage, and a 23-megapixel camera. The Snapdragon 821 clocking at 2.3Ghz.. With specifications like that, the ZenFone 3 Deluxe may very well be Asus' first truly flagship-class mobile. The ZenFone 2 line had more midrange specifications in general, but also reflected this with an affordable price tag. This new variant of the ZenFone 3 with its flagship specifications, on the other hand, is going to start at USD499 (about PHP23,000). The Snapdragon 821 processor may be even more expensive.. Regardless, there will still be multiple versions of the ZenFone 3 that will come out, catering to the various market segments. But those looking for a strong flagship device can finally consider Asus as an option.. There are other rumors suggesting a Snapdragon 823-powered variant will also rear its head, and we will report once we get more information on that.. Read more news on this product.

Asus ZenFone 3 ZE552KL Smartphone Review. Manuel Masiero ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 10/29/2016. Android Smartphone Touchscreen. Asus has treated the 5.5-inch ZenFone 3 to premium looks while keeping performance and configuration in mind. The outcome is a good and affordable mid-range smartphone that hardly exhibits any shortcomings in the test..

Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here .. ZenFone 3 ZE552KL , Asus sends a mid-range smartphone into the race, which is supposed to convince primarily with its two (8 and 16 megapixel) camera modules. However, that alone is not enough to outclass the opponents in the hard-fought market sector of up to around 400 Euros (~$440). Therefore, Asus has provided the 5.5-inch ZenFone 3, officially priced at 359 Euros (~$395), other virtues, as well. Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 octa-core SoC, integrated. graphics chip, and generous 4 GB of RAM, the ZE552KL is based on a very solid platform that fits well into the smartphone's mid-range positioning. The other configuration specs are also impressive: 64 GB of storage, a 2.5D Corning Gorilla glass-protected IPS panel with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, the latest Android 6.0, and a wireless module with Wi-Fi 802.11ac and LTE.. Asus offers other configurations besides the ZE552KL. Starting with the almost technically identical but marginally smaller 5.2-inch ZenFone 3 ZE520KL. It is based on the same SoC, but only sports 3 GB of RAM. The battery capacity is also a bit lower (2650 mAh vs. The other two members of the ZenFone 3 family make use of the superlative: The 5.7-inch ZenFone 3 Deluxe configuration of 6 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage makes it the premium model of the lineup and is allegedly on par with high-end handsets such as Samsung's Galaxy S7. If a smartphone cannot be big enough, the ZenFone 3 Ultra is a genuine phablet with a 6.8-inch screen.. Back to the ZE552KL: We let our review sample compete against the identically configured Honor 8 , OnePlus 3 , Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) , and ZTE Axon 7.. Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 Qualcomm Adreno 506.

The slim 7.7-millimeter (~0.3 in) casing of Asus' ZenFone 3 is completely made of metal that is glass protected on both the front and rear. The sleek surfaces display some more fingerprints than smartphones with a matte or rubber-coated back cover would. However, this is not a drawback in terms of feel. The smartphone could be held safely in the test, and it never conveyed the feeling that it would slip out of our hands. Furthermore, the material composition of glass and metal give the ZE552KL high stability - even stronger warping attempts did not affect the smartphone. Nevertheless, the ZenFone 3 is not invulnerable as we accidentally found out: The smartphone sustained some minor injuries after falling from a table. These were, however, limited to superficial scratches on the display's lower right edge (see third screenshot in the gallery).. In total, the ZE552KL looks very high quality. The 2.5D Corning Gorilla glass-protected IPS panel contributes to this to some degree. The screen surface is lightly curved at the corners and edges, and it is inserted seamlessly into the slightly lower surrounding metal bezel. A fingerprint scanner is situated on the rear below the primary camera. It not only allows unlocking the smartphone, but also launches the camera, allows taking photos, and accepting incoming calls.. Asus offers the ZenFone in four different colors: Moonlight White, Shimmer Gold, Aqua Blue and Sapphire Black. The latter adorns our review sample.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. octa-core processor clocks inside Asus' ZenFone 3. It can fall back on 4 GB of LPDDR3 RAM. Technically, the CPU, as well as the integrated. Adreno 506 graphics chip, is situated in the mid-range. Applications should thus run just as smoothly as graphically demanding games.. Almost 52 GB of the 64 GB storage in the ZE552KL are available out of the box. The internal storage can be expanded via a micro-SD card when the dual-SIM feature is not used. A maximum of 2 TB is possible. The micro-SD could only be formatted as portable storage and not internal storage in the test. Moving apps to the micro-SD card (App2SD) was thus not possible. In return, the ZE552KL supports DLNA that Asus calls "Digital Media Server", and Miracast ("PlayTo"). Both are found in the settings in the menu item "more". Asus' handset does not support NFC.. A USB 2.0 port is situated on the smartphone's lower edge. It can be used for connecting peripherals via USB OTG. Furthermore, the USB port is implemented as Type-C, which allows connecting plugs with either side since both sides are the same. The USB Type-C port also provides the basis for another convenient feature: The Quick Charge 3.0 technology by Qualcomm. It takes advantage of the higher voltages and electric currents that USB Type-C can provide in contrast to a standard USB port. The deactivated smartphone only needed a bit less than two hours to recharge fully.. Asus ships the ZenFone 3 with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Rather than the stock user interface, Asus installs its self-developed ZenUI 3.0. ZenUI does not change the fundamental handling compared with the proprietary GUI. However, it involves a slightly different design and interesting additional features. Furthermore, the latest iteration of ZenUI is also a bit more colorful than the former ZenUI 2.0.. For example, animated backgrounds and the app "Game Genie" that allows streaming games via YouTube and Twitch are new. "Mobile Asus Manager" is also preloaded. This is a kind of tuning app that, for example, frees storage, regulates power consumption, and scans the smartphone for security risks. The tool collection also includes known applications, such as the "Laser Ruler". This app uses the ZenFone 3's laser autofocus to measure the distance between the smartphone and a determined object. However, this only functions over short distances of up to 1.5 meters (~4.9 feet).. Besides many practical apps, Asus has also preloaded a number of niche apps, like TripAdvisor, Puffin or MiniMovie, on the smartphone. Less would have been more here since these apps cannot be uninstalled, but at most disabled and thus unnecessarily reserve storage capacity.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Asus' ZenFone 3 supports the 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi standards in the 2.4 and 5 GHz networks. Although data sharing via our Linksys EA8500 was very stable, it was also disappointingly slow. The smartphone barely surpassed 30 MBit/s. and ZTE's Axon 7, are pretty much exactly ten times faster in Wi-Fi.. Our ZenFone 3 review sample is the international version supporting up to LTE Cat. According to the specifications, the same smartphone for the Chinese market supports speeds of up to LTE Cat. 7 (300 MBit/s down; 100 Mbit up) while certain Asian territories like Taiwan,.

The ZenFone 3 can utilize GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS, and BDSS for localization. In the test, the smartphone found our position quickly and with high accuracy no matter if we were indoors or out.. We tested how well the ZenFone 3 fares in practice on our approximately 12-kilometer bike test route alongside Garmin's Edge 500 professional GPS for comparison. The ZE552KL did a good job although it sometimes placed us slightly off-route. In the end, the smartphone and professional navigation system only deviated by approximately 200 meters (~220 yards) on the total route. This is negligible in view of the distance. Thus, the ZenFone 3's GPS is sufficient for everyday app use.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

Big surprises are not expected from a phone app: Contact list, keypad, and call lists - Asus' ZenFone 3 also provides this. When using two SIM cards, one can be preferred for telephony or be set up for call forwarding in case the other card is not available.. The ZenFone 3 made a good impression in calls. The voice quality was impeccable during the test regardless whether the contact used the landline or a mobile network connection. Interfering background noises were not an issue during the calls. The speaker's position in the ZenFone 3 proved advantageous in hands-free mode. The contact is clear even when the ZenFone 3 is placed on a table since the small sound membranes are situated on the smartphone's lower edge.. Primary camera photo (click for original). The ZenFone 3 has an 8-megapixel webcam with an f/2.0 aperture, which promises decent light sensitivity. In fact, the webcam produces satisfactory pictures at up to 3264x2448 pixels, which can also be prettied up via additional photo modes, such as beautify (especially for selfies), HDR or GIF animations. The webcam records videos at up to 1920x1080 pixels and 30 frames per second.. The 16-megapixel primary camera also relies on an f/2.0 aperture. The camera lens is Sony's IMX298 with six camera lenses and optical image stabilizer. The focus system is a triple mechanism called "TriTech", in which a contrast-based autofocus works together with a laser autofocus and phase detection autofocus. According to the spec sheet, it focuses within 30 milliseconds - it functioned impeccably in testing routine. Other features are a dual-LED flash, a selectable HDR function and the option of setting important photography parameters like sensitivity, white balance, and exposure time manually.. Photos in the native resolution (4656x3492 pixels) are only possible in the 4:3 format. The resolution has to be reduced to 12 megapixels for 16:9 photos. The video quality can be increased up to 4K (3840x2160 pixels).. At first glance, the 16-megapixel camera delivers good photos with vivid colors. The photos are not bad even when looking closer. However, fine image details are only displayed more or less faded up to frayed in every single test photo. ZTE's Axon 7 and OnePlus' 3 do a much better job here, and they both add a bit more dynamics. Then again, Asus' handset fares well in night shots although image noise becomes apparent fairly quickly.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. Besides our test photos, we check the sharpness and colors in defined test conditions. For this, we photograph ColorChecker Passport and our test chart as full-frame as possible. The photos are not edited afterward. The ZenFone 3 reproduced colors are a bit too warm and saturated - although this does not really look natural, the photos look good with it. Users can set the color temperature manually if the reproduction does not appeal to them. The ZenFone 3's definition is satisfactory although the transitions between the single photo elements are always slightly frayed.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. Asus ships the ZenFone 3 with a modular power supply, USB Type-C cable, an in-ear headset, a quick start guide, and warranty card. The manufacturer does not offer any product-specific accessories for its smartphone on its website. The ZenFone 3 comes with a 24-month warranty. The battery and included accessories are only covered for 6 months.. The capacitive touchscreen in Asus' ZenFone 3 offers the fingers little resistance and can process up to 10 inputs simultaneously. The Full HD panel implements commands very quickly and accurately up into the corners. This even worked when wearing gloves. The ZenUI interface can then be used just as smoothly. Stutters or other interruptions of any kind were not noticed during the test.. The virtual keyboard's diverse input options are praiseworthy. It fades in a number bar and facilitates handling via swipe inputting and word suggestions by default. The keyboard can be scaled up by up to two-thirds of the screen optionally, but not much of the screen content remains then. The Android buttons are implemented as sensor keys below the screen, but they are unfortunately not backlit.. One screen setting that could contribute to more comfortable operation is the blue light filter that can be activated via screen and quick settings. It reduces blue light to prevent eyestrain.. The IPS panel in Asus' ZenFone 3 has a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and achieves a high pixel density of 401 PPI, which results in a razor-sharp reproduction. Furthermore, a very homogeneous illumination of 93 percent and high brightness, on average 633.2 cd/mÂ², very clearly outperforms the competition.. are the first to follow at quite some long distance with 431 cd/mÂ² and 443 cd/mÂ². The ZenFone 3 can automatically adapt the screen brightness via its ambient light sensor so that it does not get too bright. For a change, the ZE552KL does not present a top rate in black level with 0.66 cd/mÂ², but its high contrast of 997:1 compensate this.. Users can choose among the four display color modes "Balance", "Blue light filter", "Vivid", and "Adapted". The relatively color-neutral "Balance" mode is set by default while switching to "Vivid" visibly brightens up the reproduction.. 635 cd/m² 634 cd/m² 651 cd/m² 630 cd/m² 658 cd/m² 636 cd/m² 625 cd/m² 610 cd/m² 620 cd/m². 93 % Center on Battery: 658. cd/m²) ΔE Color 4.9 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 5.8 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.26.

Examining the ZenFone 3's subjectively impeccable reproduction in an objective test using a spectrophotometer and professional CalMAN software exhibits some weaknesses after all. The shifts in the color and grayscale reproduction are both higher than ideal (DeltaE <3) in the preset "Balance" mode. The color temperature of 7840 K also clearly overshoots the target (6500 K), which lets the image look slightly too cool. Then, all aberrations are even a bit higher in "Vivid" mode. However, the measured inaccuracies are virtually not noticed in everyday use, especially since the color reproduction can be set at will..

This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. Thanks to the screen's high brightness, the viewing angle stable Asus ZenFone 3 is very suitable for outdoor use. Of course, the reflective glass surface is distracting in unfavorable light conditions, but it ultimately does not affect use decisively. The ZenFone 3 also reaps in good ratings in viewing angle stability thanks to its IPS panel. The screen only looks a bit brighter or darker in extreme viewing perspectives, but this does not have an impact on legibility.. Powered by Qualcomm's mid-range Snapdragon 625 and 4 GB of RAM, Asus' ZenFone 3 achieves a decent performance that always ensured a smooth workflow in the test. The benchmarks illustrate the smartphone's real potentials. The ZenFone 3 places itself just before Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2016) but cannot catch up to the overall slightly faster Honor's 8 and OnePlus' 3 in the synthetic tests..

Reading and writing data is one of the ZenFone 3's favorite tasks. It sometimes gets Honor's 8 in difficulties in sequential and random data transfer, and it can even surpass OnePlus' 3 in sequential write. Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2016 ) cannot quite keep up, but it still achieves an above-average write/read performance.. This is just as true for the ZenFone 3 when looking at the micro-SD performance. Although Asus' smartphone cannot fully exhaust the potential of our Toshiba Exceria Pro M401 (max. 80 MB/s write), reference card, it achieves good rates with 79.2 MB/s in read and 50.1 MB/s in write..

Asus' ZenFone 3 smoothly runs up-to-date Android games. Even hardware-driven games like " Asphalt 8: Airborne " can be played in a higher resolution without the frame rate coming close to the boundary of playable and jerky. The Full HD panel and its tremendous pixel density will also satisfy fans of strategy games, adventures, and MMOs. The ZenFone 3 even clearly displays small yet important image details, such as hit-points, hex grids or percentage values in the character screen, for example in the strategy role game " Banner Saga 2 ".. With a maximum temperature of 39.1 Â°C (102.4 Â°F), the ZenFone 3 is one of the smartphones that barely heat up even during full load. It is even just 31.6 Â°C (88.9 Â°F/back) and 33 Â°C (91.4 Â°F/front) on average in idling or when using standard apps. As the stress test with GFXBench illustrates, the ZenFone 3 not only pretends to run smoothly. The SoC did not throttle for potential thermal reasons but always stably maintained its high-performance even after running the T-Rex test 30 times.. 37.8 °C 38.2 °C 38.6 °C. 37.3 °C 36.8 °C 37.9 °C. 36 °C 36.3 °C 36.4 °C.

The mono speaker in the ZenFone 3 is situated on the USB port's right and it will thus not be covered when the smartphone is placed on a table. Up to 83.7 dB(A) can be extracted from the small speaker. As to the sound, the high tones prevail while mids are scarce and bass is heard only vaguely, at best. However, this is true for most smartphone sound systems, which only sound good when connecting a headset.

Frequency diagram in comparison (checkboxes above can be turned on/off!). The ZenFone 3 can fall back on a 3000 mAh, non-removable, lithium-ion battery, and it combines this with an overall low power consumption. Although the smartphone has the highest idle power consumption with 2.12 watts, it belongs to the top energy-savers with 5.46 watts when loaded. Samsung's Galaxy A5 (2016) is most frugal with 5.08 watts. The ZenFone 3 supports Quick Charge 3.0 and was fully recharged in roughly two hours in the test..

Although all comparison devices have a virtually identical battery capacity, they present very different runtimes. The ZenFone 3 and OnePlus' 3 are up front. The ZenFone 3 lasted over 13 hours in the practical Wi-Fi test, which should be enough for roughly two days of consistent browsing. Only OnePlus' 3 is better with exactly 14 hours among the comparison devices. The ZenFone played our Full HD test video ("Big Buck Bunny") over 15 hours before it was depleted. OnePlus' 3 cannot compete with that, but it still achieves a very good runtime of 14 hours and 7 minutes.. Idle (without WLAN, min brightness) 25h. NBC WiFi Websurfing Battery Test 1.3 13h.

Review sample courtesy of Asus Germany. Asus places a very stylish, 5.5-inch smartphone at the starting line that also convinces with inner values. With Qualcomm's Snapdragon 625 octa-core processor and 4 GB of RAM, the ZenFone has plenty of power that will be enough for all up-to-date applications and games. Furthermore, features like a very bright and viewing angle stable, Full HD panel and a 16-megapixel camera that shoots satisfactory photos are also present. The good configuration also includes LTE, a dual-SIM slot, a Type-C reversible USB port including Quick Charge technology, and a fingerprint scanner. The latest Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, which Asus covers with the new version of its ZenUI interface, rounds off the successful package. The long battery life and low temperature development during use should not be left unmentioned.. Asus has created a designer piece with its ZenFone 3. The mid-range smartphone looks considerably more expensive than it actually is.. There is not much to criticize. The Android keys below the screen are not backlit and transferring data via Wi-Fi is more sluggish than fast. Asus is also a bit too generous with the software configuration and unnecessarily preloads many apps on the smartphone. In the test, we could not move apps to our micro-SD cards since they could not be formatted as internal storage.. Asus Zenfone 3 ZE552KL - 2016-10-21 10/21/2016 v5.1 Manuel Masiero.

ZenFone 3 review: Zen and the art of great midrange phones. 2016/07/17 3:01am PST Jul 17, 2016. If a phone falls in the woods with no-one around to hear it, does the screen still crack?. USB Type C and speaker on the bottom. SIM tray on the left, which you need a pin to pop out. Double tap home to enter one-hand mode (partially solves the "bigness" issue). Long press the app switch button to take a screenshot (beats the pants off volume down + power finger gymnastics). Double tap the fingerprint sensor to open the camera; single tap to take a picture. Double tap the home screen to sleep / wake. to jump into the camera from sleep. Customizable "ZenMotion" touch gestures for launching apps from wake. Any app can be placed behind a lock screen using the aptly named AppLock. Lots and lots and lots of themes. Some free, some cost a buck or two, but there are many themes to choose from. Easy Mode , which, let's face it, is basically Old Person Mode , complete with extra-large font and a maximum of 9. Kids Mode , which is almost the same as Easy Mode except you need to enter a. PIN to access other apps, answer phone calls, or leave Kids Mode. 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Features & Highlights 4.1 If a phone falls in the woods with no-one around to hear it, does the screen still crack? 4.2 ZenUI: Clean, straightforward. (Except for the bloat.) 4.3 Zenning out with some games 4.4 Crouching Tiger, Hidden ZenFone 5 Conclusion. The original ZenFone would be two years old this month, but I doubt many of them are still in use. It was highly anticipated before release, and widely panned shortly thereafter. I have friends who bought the first generation ZenFone, and the issues were obvious right from the start: the battery couldn't last half a day, the UI was clumsy and unresponsive, it got so hot you could barely hold it, and the build quality and design really weren't up to par.. A lot has changed in the last two years. The ZenFone 2 was well-received by our team and continues to be a good buy for the price. But ASUS has been hard at work, and I am happy to tell you that today, the ZenFone 3. is getting me that much closer to smartphone Nirvana: a good phone,. There are a lot of models to choose from in the new ASUS ZenFone lineup. Six, actually; or seven, if you count the ZenPad 3.. a couple of days ago, and I picked one up. to replace my aging Sony Xperia ZL. I was torn between the 5.2" ZE520KL and the 5.5" ZE552KL, but eventually decided on paying the extra $60 and I'm glad that I did. Let me cut right to the chase: everything that was wrong with the ZenFone 2 Laser from our previous review has been fixed with the ZenFone 3, and then some. Well, almost everything: the software bloat remains.. 5.2" (146.9 x 74 x 7.7mm, 144g) vs. 5.5" (152.6 x 77.4 x 7.7mm, 155g). 1080 Super IPS+, Gorilla Glass 3. 8-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 @ 2.0GHz. 64GB (but 11.3GB is reserved for the system). 6, FDD band 1/2/3/5/7/8/18/19/26/28, TD band 38/39/40/41. Slot 1: Micro SIM, Slot 2: Nano SIM OR microSD up to 128GB. 16MP f/2.0 rear, 8MP f/2.0 front. Fingerprint reader, laser (for autofocus and can be used to measure distance). 2 years 100GB Google Drive storage. This was the same with the ZenFone 2 Laser, and apparently ASUS has made some huge strides since the original ZenFone. I'll have no problem going all day, and I use my phone a lot. It took about 90 minutes to go from 4% to 97% charge. I almost never like skins, but the new ZenUI is not bad at all. It has some quirks, but overall very clean. The picture quality is pretty good, even in the low light scenes, and the camera app has just about every manual feature I could want. It probably can't compete with the Galaxy S7 , but then again, the S7 can't even come close on price. Oh, and it shoots in 4K. Clearly visible in broad daylight, unless the screen is pointed directly at the sun. Yet again, ASUS has put out a great bang-for-your-buck device. $250 for the 5" version, and around $310 for this 5.5" ZE552KL -. a great price for a very solid phone.. Granted, these are not unique to ASUS, but coming from Sony (soft keys FTW), I am not a fan. I like to have that extra bottom bezel to hold the device with my thumb. Also, there's no backlight, so they are impossible to see in the dark. (Yeah, I know, there are only 3 and they're pretty easy to remember, but a backlight would be nice - doesn't Taiwan overproduce LEDs anyway?). Why? Just why? And why does this seem to be so popular these days from many different manufacturers? It looks good ; not great. It gets smudged to hell, instantly, every time you hold the device. It can shatter, just like the front, and would be just as difficult to replace.. I'll take unbreakable, unsmudgeable plastic over glass on the back of a budget phone any day of the week. It's loud, but that's about it. The speaker quality is not something I. to listen to for any length of time. The included equalizer software helps a little bit. ASUS is pushing its own two social apps, ZenCircle and ZenChat, as basically Facebook and Messenger equivalents. And everything on ZenCircle is in Mandarin (possibly because I have a Taiwanese device, but it's set to English). I already have at least a dozen different messaging and social apps, I certainly don't need another one specific to people who have ASUS phones. Better than previous generations, but there were still 8 pre-installed 3rd party apps on the phone, none of which I wanted. There are also around 25 ASUS apps in total, that can only be disabled (but not uninstalled). Some of them are useful (system-wide audio equalizer, FM radio, note pad); many are not.. The ring around the edge is smooth but ever-so-slightly-rubberized plastic. I really think ASUS should have gone for a more tactile. plastic instead of the glass, or at least something more grippy around the outside. more premium with glass, but it just doesn't make any sense. Thankfully, I bought a case together with my phone, and I strongly advise you to get one. If you just want a rubber bumper case, that would be fine. I went for a 3rd party flip case. ASUS is making their own flip case for this phone, but it's more expensive. Apparently you can see the clock through a circular cut-out on the front, a feature that I don't really care about.. But before you tuck your phone into its case, and before you smudge your grubby little hands all over this fingerprint magnet of glass, take at least a little while to admire it - it is actually quite good-looking. The buttons on the right side of the phone are very tactile. They're raised enough and patterned enough to be obvious, and very satisfyingly clicky.. The fingerprint reader placement is also pretty good, but it's almost a double-edged sword. Without a case, the placement is perfect. With a case, or at least with my thicker 3rd party flip case, you end up trying to stick your finger in the cut-out to hit the fingerprint reader just right. 9 out of 10 times, and I'm still getting used to it.. Size-wise, this phone is big - for me. If you're used to 5.5" phones or larger phablets, it's probably nothing new, but I'm coming from a 5" phone with soft keys. The extra half-inch of screen size, combined with the capacitive buttons being below the screen rather than at the bottom of it really makes a difference. It is just barely possible for me to reach. the bottom row of capacitive buttons or. the notification bar without feeling like the phone is going to pop out of my hand. I'm glad I didn't wait for the 5.7" Deluxe model. This one is big enough, and I've got big hands.. The rest of the phone is pretty straightforward:. So the first thing to do when you get a ZenFone is open up your app drawer, tap the menu, and tap Uninstall. Then you can uninstall or disable any apps you don't want with a single tap & confirm dialog.. The pre-installed apps for the Taiwanese version include: Amazon Kindle, a couple of Taiwan-specific shopping sites, Yahoo Auctions, Puffin Browser, Instagram, a Taiwan game app store and some games (Need For Speed & The Sims). There were 8 of those in total, which I removed.. Here is a list of all of the included ASUS Zen apps:. I've disabled all but 10 of those. Curiously, when using the ZenUI home screen, the phone, camera, and a couple of other Zen apps always display in Chinese even with the device set to English. The English names show up if I switch to another launcher.. Note: some of the apps in the screenshots were installed when I synced my Google account.. One of the things I like about ZenUI is the multi-purposing. Smartphones generally don't have more than a couple of buttons, but the whole idea of Zen is that sometimes less is more. Here are some shortcuts I've found to be useful:. a couple of "ZenMotion Motion Gestures" (yes that's what they are called on the phone). you can do without touching the screen. For instance, when you get a call, you can turn your phone face down to silence it, or put it next to your ear to answer.. Mobile Manager, ASUS's version of an Android housekeeper,. job of cleaning up all of the mess and gunk that builds up on a phone over time. From one app, it is super simple to clean up apps that spam your notifications, apps. that start on boot, apps that take too many permissions, or apps that eat too much mobile data. You get fine grained control over all of those things in a very intuitive interface. It also has a "speed boost" app. You should not use a task killer on Android , but since many people don't know any better, maybe at least including it with the phone. will prevent people from downloading one of the junk, spyware-like versions. Here are a couple of other cool features ASUS provides that someone might want to know about:. One thing I found rather frustrating was that the quick launch buttons (the ones in the notification shade) are divided into two sections, labeled ambiguously as "tools" (green) and "items" (blue), and you must have exactly 4 "tools" (one row) and either 8 or 12 "items" (2 or 3 rows). I found that I only wanted 2 of the "tools" but 10 of the "items", which also adds up to 12, but is not a possible choice. I tried Need For Speed: No Limits. and as a (very) casual gamer, I am more than satisfied with the performance of the ZenFone 3. Sure, it's not as fast as the Snapdragon 820 (or now the 821 ), with undoubtedly slower benchmarks and all of that jazz. But you know what? It runs smoothly without any discernible. lag or choppiness, and the graphics look about as good as they get on phones. Good enough for me, and I would say good enough for the majority of casual gamers.. Indirectly related to gaming, there is also a pretty cool feature ASUS has included called Game Genie. As the name suggests, it's meant for gamers, but you can in fact use it in any app. It's essentially just a screencasting tool that allows you to simultaneously record the screen, the front facing video camera, and microphone. Watch me play Need For Speed :. Note: the slight choppiness in the video is not there with Game Genie turned off - I guess the graphics rendering struggles a bit while simultaneously recording the screen and front-facing camera.. I stopped by the local zoo to test out the camera, and I'm very happy with the performance for the price of this device. Manual focus, exposure, and shutter speed definitely allow for some better looking pics than the auto mode, although auto is OK for a quick point and shoot. One thing is noticeable about the camera immediately: it's fast.. For the autofocus and for the actual image capture; both feel very, very fast. You can even shoot in rapid fire succession and sort through your pics afterwards to find the best ones, I got up to about 15 photos before the camera app finally paused for a moment to work on the processing. After 1-2 seconds it was ready to go again.. There is a lot of blooming, and backlit signage is practically invisible. The picture looks a bit grainy as well if you zoom in, presumably because of the higher ISO setting. Daytime pics, however, look really good.. "mostly auto," i.e., in manual mode but with most of the options set to auto. You can see in the filename whether or not the photo was taken with HDR mode on (if the filename ends with "HDR_On"). The video camera records in 4K, and the clip below was shot in full auto mode and uploaded directly to YouTube.. design and build screen audio camera zenui skin price. ASUS ZenFone 3 ZE552KL 7.3 / 10. Overall, the ZenFone 3 is an excellent mid-range, mid-2016 smartphone. The low points for me are some aspects of the design, the audio quality, and the software bloat. The high points are basically everything else:. the screen is bright (but could be better in direct sun),. the camera shoots 4K video, and some of the. Best thing about it? It's only $250-300, unlocked.. I would definitely recommend this phone to someone who is not a phone snob, but who would appreciate a quality phone at the right price. I almost never buy phones that have just been released as the prices drop so quickly, but the ZenFone 3 was cheaper than almost. anything comparable, even against other phones that have been out. for 6 months or a year already.. to see how the ZenFone 3 holds up after a few months of daily use, and since it was just released we really have no way of knowing.. But I am keeping my fingers crossed.. While it hasn't brought me directly to Phone Nirvana, I've been pleasantly surprised by the Zen of the ZenFone 3..

You can in Taiwan - I don't think release dates have been announced elsewhere yet.. Just an FYI because I saw people asking elsewhere - some of the apps were installed when I synced my Google account. Bitcoin and Firefox were not pre-installed. The pre-installed apps were in the Apps4U folder in one of the screens above, stuff like Kindle, a couple of Taiwan-specific shopping sites, Yahoo Auctions, Puffin Browser, Instagram, a Taiwan game app store and some games (Need For Speed & The Sims). There were 8 of those in total, which I removed. Here is a list of all of the included ASUS apps:. Share Link (WiFi file transfer - very useful). Splendid (Screen calibration - very useful). I've disabled all but 10 of those.. Great to see an English language review so quickly! Could you add any more details about battery life, like SOT or a benchmark? I'm interested in how efficient the 14nm 625 really is.. So far today just over 6 hours screen on time at 40% battery. Mostly web, YouTube, camera / video, chat / social. Screen on full brightness auto, about half WiFi half mobile data.. People scared of the iPhone 6s Plus-size dimensions might not have to worry about choosing the 5.2 inch version with the smaller battery if it's that efficient.. But will it survive 6 hours of Pokemon?. I might overestimate my walking ability a bit.. the zenfone jsut read has intel and pokemon go claims they do not support intel processors for phones. so pokemon won't work according to them. intel processor support pokemon go now also this device use Snapdragon 625 so it doesnt matter... the device have great battery life so i think it will survive 6 hours of pokemon go.. The GSMarena page needs to be updated.. not all models have FM radio - The Ultra does not have it while the Deluxe has it.. Headphones / audio cable required for the radio, though.. Fine by me, I expected as much. I never go without headphones anyway.. Also bluetooth headphones does not work with the radio, it immediately shuts down the radio once a bluetooth headset is detected.. I haven't invested in bluetooth headphones yet, but that's good to know.. Every phone with FM radio uses headphones cable as an antenna.. My phone (Redmi Note 2, and I assume other Xiaomi phones) works without plugging in headphones. I'm guessing it has a built in antenna.. Is it possible to uninstall the fm app? Because I think I did that on Mi5 and can't confirm what you said :|. Can't find it, not even in the full app list (I thought maybe I disabled it). I did uninstall the music app, so I am not sure if I didn't somehow uninstall it too.... This information has been known to me for a while now, but I appreciate regardless.. How much free space was on the phone after you uninstalled the apps that could be?. Also, nice to see an AP review highlight the stupidity of glass backs on a mobile device.. I'm not sure about that, because I didn't check in between uninstalling the included apps and installing my own. I don't think it would be much different though since the games were not actually installed from the factory - they were just buttons to download from the Play Store.. And yeah, I cannot for the life of me understand the glass back. I probably won't see it much if at all in the flip caSe though, so *meh*.. Can you confirm that this phone is still uses the old Gorilla Glass 3 or is it the new Gorilla Glass 4 like in the Zenfone 2 Laser?. It is hard to believe they would have a glass back and use old glass.... It's hard to confirm exactly what type of glass it is, the official specs sheet and all of the Taiwanese references only say "Corning 2.5D tempered glass" as far as I can tell, nothing about the specific generation of Gorilla Glass. The only place I've seen it say that it's Gorilla Glass 3 is gsmarena and I'm not sure where their source is.. I have the Zen phone 2 laser with android 6. Well I guess this as good place as any to mention the mi5's glass back, I was skeptical about it, but am positively surprised by how good it has held up to usage by me and how it's really hard to see any smudges... Though I have only used the white one, so no idea how other colors stand up.... My unlocked HTC 10 didn't come with as many of their own apps included as the ZenFone 3 does and the only 3rd apps were Facebook (with Messenger) and Instagram but I am still looking go back to a Nexus phone.. I use 85% of the apps. Is there any multitasking function in Zenui? Split-screen, floating window, etc?. Not that I am aware of.. Can you guys do a comparison between the 5.5" Zenfone 3 and the ZTE Axon 7? I wanna know what the $100 difference is here.. i have zte axon a1r just got it but seems be pretty solid. minus fact it has no led notification light lol. maybe in an update as it's pretty new.. I feel like I've seen this phone before. Dual glas design was used way before Samsung even stepped up to more premium materials... Also the corners of S7 are more rounded and don't make the phone feel that rectangular as the Asus. must be some Samsung fanboy trying to show the world that everyone try copying Samsung... I didn't mean it like that. I guess it being a joke wasn't very clear. Also fyi, Huawei Mate 8 #mate8masterrace. LOL at glass being "more premium". It's more fragile than metal, and more slippery than plastic.. And prettier than both, while wireless charging still works with it.. Plastic is less fragile than glass, works with wireless charging, and has less need to be surrounded by an ugly plastic case.. The concept of "premium" is stupid in general, but look prettier it does.. that pretty glass shatters, doesnt look so pretty anymore...lol. I see you've fallen for the marketing hype of "pretty = premium".. I see you conveniently didn't read my second sentence in an attempt to sound like a smartass.. I see you conveniently ignoring that's exactly what you did in your previous reply.. So I guess we're both smartasses?. What did I ignore? "My condolences"?. Or the reasoning why plastic is better before that?. It's just that I explained why the market thinks glass is premium, and that's exactly why: it's pretty.. I have no idea why, but I've been wanting this phone so much..Like almost to an unhealthy and obsessive degree. I won't go into detail here for integrity's sake. As soon as I got the pushbullet notif. for this article, I was really hoping it may have an US release date, alas, it does not. Thanks for confirming the two size. After watching tens of foreign review video and reading a bunch about the specs, none were at all consistent.. Eprice and Sogi in Taiwan always have up-to-date Asus news, and DCFever in Hong Kong is covering ZF3 also. They have all had positive initial reviews of the 5.2/5.5 ZF3, especially noting the good overall camera performance.. The phones look good, but ZenUI is terrible crap. its not locked to the device anymore, you can chage your UI when ever you want now. ZenUI is more than just themes, it's the basic apps and system settings too. Any word on when this set will be released in the US? I'm really looking forward to the Ultra as my next phone.. The Ultra comes in a china version, and a global version. Neither version has all the bands necessary to work properly with North American carriers. I think you can find it on Amazon now though.. The major problems people like myself have been having with the ZenFone 2 Deluxe Special Edition is that the battery does not last long at all... And I don't mean just daily use, I mean the battery completely ceases to function altogether after 1 or 2 months of daily device use. One would have to RMA the device to Texas (Asus support RMA repair center of North America), to get Asus to either replace the battery all together or as Asus themselves puts it in their own words "We will most likely have to give you a refurbished device, as we really don't replace parts themselves, and it would be too costly to ship it overseas just to replace the battery sir." "We actually dont replace parts here" "We just fix parts or reinstall OS firmware when needed".. So basically I purchased a brand new phone from Amazon for around $460 at the time of purchase. and its suppose to be a brand new phone. The product malfunction is the fault of the manufacture and not of the customer. And Asus is going to give me back a used previously broken device that's from someone else's RMA problems to me, after I spent $460 dollars on my what is suppose to be a "brand new device", I worked hard to save and purchase ?... Also due note, ZenFone 2 Deluxe (Special Edition) has only been release to the public around March of 2015. - My actual device is stamped being manufactured on December 2015. And already Asus has "Discontinued" the device on all online store platforms. Yup, you heard right, Asus already discontinued the smartphone device. I purchased the device 4 months prior to them having it discontinued. So already a device I spent $460 on is already discontinues and considered old. The only thing keeping my device afloat is its 7 month warranty that it has left on the device.. I personally feel that I just purchased a discontinued device now and feel cheated out of $60 dollars of my hard earned money. Its bad enough that Asus takes forever to update their firmware as millions of people are constantly begging for update to Android v6.0 Marshmallow for almost 1 year now not to mention that Google just announced and even released Android v7 (N), but now making the device discontinued is just a huge slap in the face to everyone owning a ZenFone 2 Deluxe (special edition).. So, to resume: the phone has only good aspects, because "the not so good" chart has only personal preferences from David that not impact the usage of the phone (the bottom bezel doesn't need to be hold because you can put your pinkie at the bottom of the phone to stabilize it at your hand, if you drop the phone the front panel probably will shatter so the back is the least of your problem, loud audio from the internal speaker is the characteristic that really matter about sound on a smartphone and most of pre-installed apps can be unistalled). I don't personally like stabilizing with my pinky, it feels too insecure and I'm used to having a bottom bezel. I own a Zenfone 1, even with the hardware improvements, I will not be getting another ASUS phone. ZenUI changes too much with Android, and ASUS isn't anywhere close to Samsung or Sony's level when it come to software. Their Zen apps are terrible, their OS updates constantly break important 3rd party apps, and the stability of later updates is terrible.. If they had just left it as AOSP and sold these devices, they would honestly be much better. ZenUI is too ambitious for a company that make decent hardware, but terrible software.. Not wanting excessive bloatware is hardly a "personal preference from David", much of which can apparently only be disabled not uninstalled.. Ahh, the phones-screen-down-on-rocks tradition returns! Mmm, scratches.. Rock is as hard or sometimes harder than glass - glass is made of sand, after all. If you touch rock to glass, there WILL be scratches on the glass, guaranteed. Perhaps not big, but there will be. Haven't you heard of Gorilla Glass? Apparently not. Do you even know how Gorilla Glass is made? It's still glass. Read up on some physics before posting.. If I need a microscope to see it, it doesn't bother me.. As I ZF2 owner I did not recommend any Asus' phone to anyone.. ZF2 is fast, it is a lot of RAM (4gb), but Asus is totally horrible about updates, I am not only referring about newer version of Android, but also about their own buggy software.. ZF2 had countless updates but only to fix their own bugs, and after one thing fixed they used to broken more two (I am not kidding). That's why we had countless updates, but we are still using Android 5.0 (yes, 5.0 not 5.1).. They promised Android M for 2Q and didn't realise it, now they even talk about a new date or something like this. Same happened when they promised Android 5.1, but after Google release Android M, they said they would skip 5.1 to realise M, which they broken their promise too.. Totally agree, decent hardware screwed over by terrible software. I bought this with the expectation that it might never get N, or if it did that it almost definitely would not get O. To me it's a decent trade off at this price, and definitely one of the reasons I wouldn't have gotten the Deluxe.. I wouldn't expect software updates on a budget phone with specs like that.. My Redmi Note 2 is also on 5.0.2, although it does have a Mediatek. I can't say it's been buggy though, other than the older Android version the software is solid.. Do they at least push security patches?. The last one was on May.. I was expecting for updates since this had a good hardware and it was their flagship phone.. I got July in the last update.. What I meant to say is, with hardware like that, they probably saved some money on software support.. Deluxe edition does not have the same updates as the Selfie or other models of ZF2. The thing is I WAS going to buy the ZenPad 3 and ZenFone 3,. I dont trust Asus and their shitty support. Im tired of everything about Asus. - 8 years ago I purchased a Asus motherboard for my home computer, 2 months of using it it blew on me, stopped working completely. I purchased a Gigabyte Motherboard and threw out the Asus motherboard, and Its still working today. Fast-Forward to 2016 I purchased ZenFone 2 Deluxe and I got screwed again. As of today, I will NEVER EVER purchase anything related to Asus ever.. If the motherboard failed only 2 months after purchasing it, why discard it instead of having it repaired or replaced under warranty (assuming you bought it new)? 0_o. because they want me to pay $65 shipping fee.. weird all i use for pc is asus and never an issue.. you're one of the lucky ones. there are millions of people in the same boat im in. Going to purchase a Huawei phone next. Im done with Asus and their shitty phones and shitty customer service and shitty support and shitty products.. Idol 3 cost the same amount and managed to have updates. And I also have heard some bugs people are having using CM. Not in mood for that, at least now things are less worse on the stock Android.. Loaded CM13 snapshot on a Galaxy S4 mini 4G.. It keeps losing network signal, plus reboots randomly.. Hmm, actually its the intel cpu which is the problem. Two of my frnds own zenfone. A zenfone 2 and another a zenfone laser. The laser one never gave any problem but the intel one is surely buggy as hell.. Seriously? If you take a look at Asus ZenFone Laser you'll probably change your mind.. Mostly of all bugs on ZenFone 2 are present on ZenFone Laser also.. I have used both phones for a few times. The bugs I encountered with zenfone 2 were like, camera app freezing after taking a few shots, phone being freezed when receiving a call. I never saw any bug at all in the zenfone laser (snapdragon 615).. The Wifi and GPS on my friends Asus Zenfone Laser 2 is buggy and even Marshmallow didnt fix it. I prefer the Alcatel Idol 3 4.7Inch, and its cheaper.. Well, he is complaining about his zenfone 2. And I am sure there wont be any complaint from snapdragon zenfone users. Hmm, I will ask my frnd who owns zenfone laser if he faced any problem with his phone.. This has been my exact experience.. You have to understand that they are using x86 processors and there has been a lot of problems in coding even the custom roms found online. Hopefully they get better since now they'd be using a snapdragon processor.. Haven't you read what other people and I said? It is nothing about x86 processors, even their Snapdragon phones have the same issues that ZN2 has.. I'd have given the skin a 1/10. I mean by the time i finished reading it, Asus had released next two iterations of the device. But still, a really nice article :). I'm not sure if it's common to have different bands in different countries, but that might explain it.. is correct, I'm in the U.S. Where did you purchase it? I'm in the US and while I already have Xiaomi mi5.. I like the atheistics of this phone much more and I'm trying to purchase one.. I was hoping to not have to pay the $100 extra expansys wants. But looks like I might have to.. I would advise against ordering anything from expansysm they sent me the wrong phone and took a long time to get my money back.. Ehh, nothing a fraud claim filed with your cardholder can't take care of. That'll get anyone moving to send your money back. Ah so we're doing Verge style number reviews now? ;). Our reviewers are free to use or not use them, it's a personal choice.. Some of us just never learned to count so we skip the number part.. Shouldn't a website have some sort of consistency for reviews?. So how is the OIS/EIS with recorded video....is it as good as the iphone 6s, like they keep advertising.. After a year with the ZenFone 2, I've decided to go back to a mainstream phone and ordereda Galaxy S7. Tired of waiting for updates and the last straw the spring in the SIM card slot became loose, resulting in a SIM card error.. Put a small piece of plastic sheet on top of the SIM card so that it fits tight.. I think, If one has 3GB or 4GB of RAM in his phone, then why bother about default UI, Zen UI in this case? Just install a third party launcher and then forget the Zen UI. It is the beauty of Android that we can customize our phone as we wish. Secondly, when you can either uninstall and disable default apps, those apps will not be the reason of your headache anymore. Once you are sure about craps included in the handset and then act accordingly, you will feel happy due to the performance of our phone. No Phone Manufacturer sell their device withoutthose apps which we consider as bloatware. What I can't understand is that, when Play Store is available for all and it's free, all of the apps are available there, then Why do phone manufacturers bother about pushing those bloatware? If they refrain from doing so, then we can get more and more precious inbuilt storage free.. Launcher only replaces the homescreen, mate.. After owning a plastic backed phone, I think I'm willing to sacrifice the removable backing for glass back with a case. I've had my Samsung Galaxy S5 for almost two years, although due to water damage I had to have it replaced a couple months ago. The first S5 cracked along the edge in the plastic backing and I think it eventually led to a small hole in my phone. The second S5 cracked in the exact same place, less than a couple months in. I'm not a special use case, I'm not abusing the phone. Sometimes it has a case on it, and others it doesn't, but I'm not constantly dropping the phone or doing anything that should cause damage.. On top of that, the plastic backing has three little gouges in the back now, from where my phone was carried around by a puppy. I sat the phone down for a minute and go do something, come back and find the dog carrying it. There was no damage to the front glass, but now there are teeth marks in my phone.. Yeah well wait until puppy gets a hold of your new glass backed phone.. Didn't even scratch the front glass on this phone, I doubt it'll do anything to the glass on the back.. It certainly didn't scratch the front glass when it's picked it up the first time, just the plastic backing.. G, so i was thinking and would be glad for some advise, well Im not a big fan of big screens as well. Right now Im using Sony Xperia Z5 compact, yeah softkeys :) as Im typing this lol. So I was thinking of selling this device and get Zenfone 3 with 5.2in screen, and which will even get me some extra cash, do you think that will be a good idea? And how fast is Snapdragon 625 compared to 810? I was trying to look for some benchmarks on your reviews but there arent. I am not huge on benchmarks - I prefer "perceived experience" - but, since you asked:. SEQ RD 280.2 / WR 201.43. RND RD 19733.74 / WR 2009.76. SQLite INS 81.52 / UPD 78.29 / DEL 84.65. 3D 12774 (Marooned 7767, Garden 5007). No "official" benchmarks but 3 days in a row of 40% remaining at 6 hours screen on time, so far.. No idea if you should trade in your Z5 compact. I think that screen is a tiny bit small for my taste... I liked the 5" size in the hand, but wanted a bigger screen - it's a trade off. Overall I'm happy with the 5.5" screen and will get used to the size, I suppose.. The bloat kills it for me. The bloat really wouldn't matter much if battery life comes as advertised.. I will update the post soon with my battery experience, but just FYI I'm currently on day 3 of ~40% remaining at ~6 hours screen on time. Do you have a battery saver mode on or any other battery saving tricks you are using?. $200-300 is still a lot for an off-brand mid-range device when you can get used-but-in-great-condition previous-year flagships for around $200 (or sometimes less). Heck, you can sometimes find brand-new previous-year flagships for around $200.. This phone will be $200 in a few months, for sure. Also, ASUS is not at all an "off-brand" device. It may be a relative latecomer to smartphones, but definitely not an off-brand. For comparison, Taiwan Mobile (a medium sized telecom company here) makes their own smartphones for like $80. It's already on ebay for as low as $309 http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR10.TRC2.A0.H0.Xzenfone+3.TRS2&_nkw=zenfone+3&_sacat=0. I can't wait to buy one. I think it's a bargain, even at $300 for the 5.5" model. Included is a certified High Res audio player. A stand alone High Res player with 24 bit/192k oversampling will cost you $300. The camera is great too with the Sony IMX298 CMOS sensor. Manufacturers set a lowest advertised price and it pretty much stays there until the product is set to be replaced by a newer model. Take the Zenfone 2 laser for instance. Retail is $250 and 8-9 months after it's introduction it's still $230. Maybe there will be a sale in a few months but if $50 makes that much of a difference then maybe you should skip cell phones altogether because the service plan will be more than you can afford.. So this is the new Samsung back in 2-3 years ago that came with a lot of bloatware.. Did you actually USE the original Zenfone, or just read a few people slagging it off online and join in with the sheep. Still using my ZenFone 5 after nearly 2 years now - nope, never been "almost too hot to hold". Nope, never had any problem whatsoever with "unresponsive UI". Oh wait your FRIENDS bought one...oh well now that qualifies you then, eh. Build quality was actually one of the things it was renowned for too. Just so you're a bit more clued up for the next time you revert to mentioning something you have no first-hand experience of.. You know, I may be in the minority here, but my Intel powered ZF2 has not given me any issues. To be fair I only bought it because Cyanogenmod was available and it had good specs for the price, with no intentions of keeping it stock. Sir does it have fast charging and nfc?. I don't care about NFC and fast charging, while convenient greatly shortens the battery life. That's an issue now that most phones don't have user replaceable batteries.. I have a 5 hour layover in Taiwan next week. I hope there are stores in the airport that sell them or any store near the international airport. Should be possible, I bought an HTC One E8 when it was first released at the Taipei airport a couple years ago. Should be a slight discount from the list price at the duty free electronics shop.. OMG! thank you! will definitely look for it. Does it have a notification LED? Multi-color? Easily visible? Thanks!. Hi, does it support double tap to wakeup?. Hi, Does this phone have Double Tap to wake up from standby?. You will pay the price twice, they will not support their flagship. Update the bottom tier and leave the top tier out to dry. Better off with a lower tier Samsung phone. Their phones don't do anything well. This company has no business in the market with their customer service and failure to back their product..

Author Dhruv Bhutani Posted on September 4, 2016 September 4, 2016 Categories Asus , Reviews. 5.5-inch (1920 x 1080 pixels) Full HD Super IPS+ display with up to 500cd/m2 brightness, 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. 2GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 625 14nm processor with Adreno 506 GPU. 4GB RAM with 64GB storage (ZE552KL), expandable memory with microSD.

The Zenfone series of phones by Asus have. A well priced device with well-balanced specifications guaranteed that the first generation was a runaway success. Asus replicated this to a degree with the myriad variants of the Zenfone 2. With the Zenfone 3, the Taiwanese company is taking a very different approach to things. Higher end materials, a greater focus on design has resulted in a decidedly higher price. Will the Zenfone 3 continue to be as appealing to consumers? We find that out in our review.. Where the first two devices were utilitarian, plastic clad handsets, the Zenfone 3 is an entirely different beast. The Glass and Metal body of the phone looks really good and is a marked improvement over anything we’ve seen from the company and for that matter most of the competition as well.. Around the 5.5 inch Full HD display panel runs a brushed metal front. A protective layer of 2.5D curved glass is placed on top of it. Because of the way the glass tapers off at the edges and seamlessly melds into the metallic frame on the sides, it gives an impression of a two color design language. The metallic frame all around has chamfered edges further adding to the design element.. Up above the screen lies the 8MP front facing camera alongside the proximity sensor. Part of the company’s design DNA, Asus still retains capacitive buttons below the screen area. These three buttons represent the back, menu and home keys. Both the volume rocker and the power button are placed on the right hand side and offer fantastic feedback. Like the rest of the body, the buttons too are made of metal. The left side of the phone is where the hybrid SIM slot is placed. Worth noting is that this is the first phone in the Zenfone series to charge over USB Type C. continues to offer a headphone jack placed at the top.. Earlier on, we mentioned that Asus had massively stepped up the design element of the phone. This is most evident on the rear of the phone. The concentric ring design of the Zenbook has been replicated here alongside the glass coating on top which makes it look absolutely gorgeous. The downside of the glossy surface is that the back is a complete fingerprint magnet. Additionally, the rear of the device is very slippery. The camera module sits proud at the top and juts out from the body surface by a millimeter or two. Flanking it on either side are the laser autofocus and LED flash modules. Below, lies the rectangular and rather glossy fingerprint reader.. 152.59 x 77.38 x 7.69mm making it very slim other than the protruding camera module. The 155 grams weight is slight hefty for the size of the phone but it makes the Asus Zenfone 3. feel well built rather than heavy.. Perhaps the achilles heel of the Zenfone 3, the phone still runs a very bloated version of Android 6.0 dubbed as Zen UI 3.0. Right from the lockscreen to the pre-installed apps, there have been customizations all the way through. In a recent conversation with Peter Chang of Asus, we were told that users quite enjoyed this implementation, it’s certainly a little hard to believe though.. The lockscreen shows the time, date, weather and notifications. You can also have three shortcuts placed here while swiping up from the corner reveals the camera module. Drop into the homescreen and you get access to the all the apps and widgets placed here. The homescreen can be modified via additional icon packs, themes and more. Additionally, unlike recent devices, you can tap a shortcut on the homescreen to enter the second level app drawer.. Asus has taken upon itself the task of providing users an app for almost every use case possible. From file managers to task lists to even a laser ruler! Removing Google’s apps from the equation, we counted a whopping 26 pre-installed apps. For what it’s worth, a couple of these can be uninstalled. You can disable most of the others but they still do end up occupying space on the phone.. There’s also a full range of gestures and shortcuts built into the device that stretch from double tapping the homescreen to enter one hand mode, long pressing the app switch button to take a screenshot as well as double tapping the fingerprint reader to open up the camera. There’s more strewn all around and they do add to the ease of use. As we said earlier, this is a very heavily customized version of Android but the additions are quite useful for the most part.. For performance and gaming junkies, a Mobile Manager and Game Genie app are built into the device. The former offers some useful features like a permissions manager, data usage tracker and a security manager all in one single place. You can also use it to clear out RAM but that’s not really advised on Android. The Game Genie app as the name suggests is designed entirely for hardcore gamers. You can use this app to capture your screen while playing and also live stream to YouTube or Twitch. A very cool feature here is that you can overlay a live video from the front facing camera over the stream from your screen while broadcasting to a social platform.. From an interface perspective, the software on the Zenfone 3 is quite inoffensive and is generally about as good as the competition while offering a couple of additional options. What we didn’t appreciate was the copious amount of bloat pre-installed on the device, something that the average user wouldn’t be able to get rid off.. Powered by a 2GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 625 14nm processor with Adreno 506 GPU, Asus is taking a more balanced approach towards performance on the Zenfone 3. By eschewing the top end Snapdragon 820 processor, the phone manages to avoid the heating and battery related issues we’ve heard of on the chipset while also managing performance that is quite positive. The processor is paired with 4GB of RAM that is sufficient for regular multitasking. Yes, the competition in the price category is starting to equip devices with 6GB of RAM but realistically there is very little to gain from. On a day-to-day basis, there was little to complain from a performance perspective. Navigating through the interface and diving into apps, everything remains as smooth as can be expected. We observed a couple of dropped frames when using the Game Genie app to capture video from the front camera while playing games but even that wasn’t much of a. We’ve included some benchmarks below to give you a better idea of comparative performance.. With a Snapdragon 625 onboard, the Zenfone 3 has performance thats about par with the Redmi Note 3. The phone scores just under 62,000 points in the AnTuTu benchmark.. In the Vellamo Multicore benchmark, the phone scores 2243 points.. With a score of 1271 points, the Zenfone 3 places right in the middle of our test bench and once again, behind the Redmi Note 3.. Lastly in the 3D Mark benchmark, the phone scores 14013 points. Once again, synthetic benchmarks aren’t entirely indicative of performance and we never really had issues with the phone throughout our use. That said, there is a point to be made about the fact that a handset that costs half that of the Zenfone 3 manages similar or even better performance.. A lot has been said about the camera on the Zenfone 3. Looking at the specifications, users get a pretty nifty package here. 16MP rear camera is paired up with a dual-tone LED Flash, PDAF as well as Laser AF,. f/2.0 aperture, 6P Largan lens and 4 stop OIS. Clearly, the hardware is good enough to deliver very competitive camera performance. The real difference lies however in the software and how well it processes the data obtained from the camera sensor. For better or worse, the Zenfone 3 continues the camera quality precedent set by the first and second generation Zenfones.. Images are generally pleasing but the tones tend to veer towards cooler shades. It is possible to adjust the white balance here so you should be able to get the colors to your liking. In our testing though, we’ve stuck to the auto mode as that’s what most casual users will depend on.. The one thing that really stuck out for us was the extremely quick focussing speeds on offer. A combination of Phase Detection Auto Focus (PDAF) and laser based autofocus means that the phone manages to keep objects tack sharp in focus and tracks them well too. Low light shots aren’t too bad from the Zenfone 3’s camera but you’ll really want to stand still for that. Additionally, there remains a modicum of noise all around and particularly in the shadows.. Day light photographs are certainly above average. The phone struggles with resolving highlights and has a tendency to blow them out. Think clouds and a bright sky, if you end up metering an object instead, the shot in most cases ends up. The persists in night shots as well in which case there is fairly heavy blooming on lights. Yes, the camera on the Zenfone 3 is pretty good but it comes with certain limitations and we are rather disappointed. that Asus still hasn’t been able to sort these out despite the fact that users have consistently pointed out these specific issues over multiple generations of their hardware.. The Full HD screen on the Zenfone 3 has a pixel density of approximately 400 ppi. The panel being used here is termed as a Super IPS+ display though it appears to be just a really bright IPS panel. No harm done though as the display really is very bright and vibrant.. We had no issue at all viewing the Zenfone 3 outdoors and even in bright sunlight despite the highly. reflective nature of the glass covered display. Yes, the resolution could’ve been higher but a 2K display on a 5.5 inch frame still isn’t critical. Icons and text look sharp and watching media on the display is an enjoyable experience.. From a connectivity perspective, the Zenfone 3 comes well equipped with most of the options you’ve come to expect. 4G LTE support with VoLTE, WiFi 802.11ac (2.4 and 5GHz) MU-MIMO as well as Bluetooth 4.2 and GPS. We’ve already mentioned that the handset charges over USB Type-C. The phone is a hybrid SIM device so you have an option of expanding built-in storage should you choose to eschew the 2nd SIM slot. Talking about storage, there’s a little under 51GB available out of the 64GB built into the handset. All that built in bloatware definitely takes a toll here.. In terms of battery life we weren’t expecting much with just a 3000 mAh unit built-in but ended up being pleasantly surprised. The Zenfone 3 handily lasts a full day of use and then some. The phone charges up very quickly so it shouldn’t be a hassle to top it off if you need some extra juice to power through a couple of extra hours.. The Zenfone 3 is without a doubt the best in the series so far but with a renewed focus on design and on portraying the handset as a premium device, it appears that Asus has taken quite a gamble. The hardware looks great and so does the screen. We also observed that battery life was absolutely amazing.. All of that does not take away from the fact that there is a significant amount of bloatware on the phone. Additionally, the camera is strictly average. Most importantly though, the phone brings mid range specs at a price point that rivals the category leading OnePlus 3. At a price point of Rs. a little hard to recommend the Zenfone 3 unless you absolutely value it’s design identity. For everyone else, the OnePlus 3 is probably the better option..
