more ... more .... more ... more .... Lacks a camera on the back. Lacks microSD slot for storage expansion. Does not support automatic screen brightness. The Nokia 106 is a basic phone. It runs the Series 30 platform and specs include 1.8" display, FM radio, LED flashlight, as well as dust- and spill- resistant keyboard.. Nokia 106 Official Page Nokia 106 manual. Dimensions: 4.44 x 1.87 x 0.59 inches (112.9 x 47.5 x 14.9 mm ). Weight: 2.62 oz (74 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Features: Numeric keypad, Soft keys, D-Pad. Resolution: 128 x 160 pixels. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Talk time: 9.90 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 35.0 days (840 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Phone features Notifications: Haptic feedback, Polyphonic ringtones (32 voices), Vibration. Availability Officially announced: 21 Aug 2013.

Nokia 106 - user opinions and reviews. 384 kB RAM storage, no card slot. Pages: 1 2 3 4 5 6 ». perfect phone for calls and texts. had some terrible falls with it but it stands strong. how can i unlock my nokia 106?. I use it mostly to play games on. is this model have auto answer setting.. A great little simple phone with good battery life (and no frills) but the volume is not very high so it's difficult to hear on some calls - just be aware that it is 2G only so cannot be used by the operator "3" because (as "3" tells me) they do not supply 2G coverage.. hi every one the 106 i dont think myou can get a better phone the that i love it.

McMaunder, 16 Jun 2015 Personally think the vibration on the Nokia 106 is incredible, you can really feel the vibrati... Is it even possible to connect the nokia 106 to a pc, or laptop in order to get more ringtone or something, or is it limited to what is only on the phone. Personally think the vibration on the Nokia 106 is incredible, you can really feel the vibrations on your leg which is slighly arousing to be honest, also love how small it is cause i really like small things eg soap bars and marbles. This phone is crap, and the support, ie a decent manual, seems to be non existent. I would not recommend it to anyone. It would probably be ok if I could get hold of a more detailed manual than the useless user guide that comes with the phone and seems to be the only one available online. Microsoft's so called "support" is rubbish, like most Microsoft products.. I have buy this phone already,. when i buy this phone i my expectation is have long live battery because in specifications the battery stand by can up to 840 h. but my battery live only one weeks. I think i'ts the best for second phone.. It is incredibly good value for money and is very lightweight. It also automatically glows in the dark once turned on and I have never heard of it getting broken. The features are very good and incredibly trustworthy and it allows for customization.. Volume level is so low I cannot use without speakerphone. If put phone down too hard the flashlight comes on. Installer had bit of trouble getting SIM to boot. Does anyone know what the calendar is like e.g. is there a limit to how many appointments that can be stored, does it allow for recurring appointments. Anonymous, 24 Apr 2015 I just got a Nokia 106 and it says emergency calls only when I've inserted my vodaphone sim. more well sexy you need a top up. ant acsess puk no help please.

On November 26, 2006, the U.S. Copyright Office ruled that consumers can legally unlock their cell phones in order to use them with rival carriers. Some times you might be able to ask your network to provide you with an unlock code. However, they will only do this for free if you have completed your contract.

This is your new best friend.. Style: UK Sim Free | Verified Purchase. Having lost patience with the poor battery life of my smartphone, I was looking at buying an external battery pack (yes, another bit of junk to carry around), when someone suggested that I look at this model, because of the promise of better battery life. Granted, I only make a few short calls on an average day, but the main reason that I carry a phone is so that people can get hold of me in an emergency. My previous phone would be dead by 5pm, and it always made me anxious when I saw that low battery warning. This has only required charging once per week. It's such a relief not to worry about battery life. There are other features which cover the most common 'pocket gadget' tasks: alarm clock, stopwatch, calculator and a pretty bright torch. There's even a radio (but no mp3 player or camera). However, these are just bells and whistles. The selling point is that this is a phone with stamina.. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Not as good as previous basic Nokia phones. Style: UK Sim Free | Verified Purchase. I've used various basic Nokia phones over the past 15 years and they have always been brilliant simple but functional phones. When the latest died after about 5 years due to some strange fault which meant it didn't ring anymore, I bought the Nokia 106. I am disappointed to say that this phone is a disappointing step back: - the sound quality is noticeably worse than previous versions - hollow sounding and more difficult to hear what someone is saying when there is background noise, such as on a busy street - the phone is significantly bigger than previous versions and doesn't sit in the pocket so well as a result - it doesn't have the handy screensaver showing the time that previous versions had - the back is a nightmare to get off first time and the instructions for doing this are rubbish (tip: you need to get your nails in around the edges and prise the back cover off) On the plus side, the battery life is great and it functions well as a phone (with the significant exception of the sound issue). I'd try to find an older model if you can - it will likely be better.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Nokia 106 - How To Open Its Back. Style: UK Sim Free | Verified Purchase. I love my new Nokia 106. If you are looking for a phone just for texting and making the occasional call, the way I do, this is the one for you. It’s just as easy to set up and operate as the Nokia 100 and has quite a few extras that may come handy. The only thing that’s difficult about this phone is removing its back. The hub of the problem is that its back part is shaped like a cradle in which the front part rests. A video on youtube shows how to go about opening the phone. But that simply wouldn’t work for me, no matter how hard I tried. Maybe it’s because I haven’t enough strength in my hands. Later I found someone on the www suggesting to stick a fingernail into the initially very tiny gap between the top of the phone and its back and wiggle it about a bit. Then stick your fingernail into the gap and gently lift first a corner of the top from it’s back part and follow that by easing the rest of the top from its cradle. As I didn't want to risk breaking a nail, I used the tip of a nail file. Magic! Since then I have also used a bland knife and that also works well. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Don't let the battery run flat.. Style: UK Sim Free | Verified Purchase. Bought this as an emergency phone for our little boy in case he got lost on holiday. It is fine - a good basic phone. Only problem was we let the battery go flat and it wouldn't charge up again afterwards. I tried the trick that has worked on other cheap nokias, of taking the battery out, warming it up and putting it back in again, and eventually that worked - it didn't look like it was charging at first, so seemed to need a bit of charge before it could show it was charging!. It's ok as a spare phone but if you want one for daily use I would get the Nokia 100 which has better build quality. The 100 is just a basic phone but was good to use and reliable until I lost it.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars half awake fumblings. Style: UK Sim Free | Verified Purchase. Didn't like this at all proper tiny screen and very plasticky lightweight build. Knew I should have picked one up in my hand before buying but the seller was very kind and took back this phone which i sent right back after picking it up. Might be great for hipsters who are ironically revisiting tech that happened at the time of their birth but I'll stick with the 6303 now I've found the colour screen! (6303i) replacement (necessary for broken screen after half awake fumblings).. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Good but not great!. Style: UK Sim Free | Verified Purchase. Even after spending a number of hours reviewing Nokia phones I wish I had spent a bit more time and asked a few more questions. Don't get me wrong all I wanted was a simple mobile for phone calls and messaging, and this is a very neat functional phone which performs those tasks OK, and it has excellent battery life. However I bought it as a replacement for a Nokia C1-01 and I naively assumed that it would have the same functionality, although I knew it didn't have a camera. Unfortunately it doesn't have Bluetooth capability nor does it have any USB links to enable you to back up your contacts to a computer, features of its predecessor. Furthermore getting in and out of the various applications is a bit more time consuming than my old Nokia. As I say it is a very neat phone and it will have to do for now, but next time I will make sure I do a bit more research!. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars This is a nice little mobile but I can only review it from .... Style: UK Sim Free | Verified Purchase. This is a nice little mobile but I can only review it from the point of view of former Nokia 1100 owner. I got almost 10 years' service from my 1100 but it was showing its age and the screen was getting too scuffed to read texts easily. As a user who doesn't want internet access from a mobile the 106 looked ideal: everything the 1100 had plus fantastic battery life. The speaker phone, FM radio and colour display were of no interest to me. Ergonomically, the 106 seems like a backward step. The rectangular shape doesn't sit so nicely in the hand and the buttons aren't as distinct which makes it quite easy to type the wrong thing. I also think it's possible to send a text in one go by accidentally pressing the call button when adding a full stop - pressing the 1 key - but luckily I haven't managed to reproduce that one! As a feature phone it works very well but I'd have expected 10 years' to produce something to make me say, "That's progress" and it doesn't. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?.

See all 98 critical reviews ›. 2.0 out of 5 stars Not as good as previous basic Nokia phones. By kinggx on 6 February 2015. I've used various basic Nokia phones over the past 15 years and they have always been brilliant simple but functional phones. When the latest died after about 5 years due to some strange fault which meant it didn't ring anymore, I bought the Nokia 106. I am disappointed to say that this phone is a disappointing step back: - the sound quality is noticeably worse than previous versions - hollow sounding and more difficult to hear what someone is saying when there is background noise, such as on a busy street - the phone is significantly bigger than previous versions and doesn't sit in the pocket so well as a result - it doesn't have the handy screensaver showing the time that previous versions had - the back is a nightmare to get off first time and the instructions for doing this are rubbish (tip: you need to get your nails in around the edges and prise the back cover off) On the plus side, the battery life is great and it functions well as a phone (with the significant exception of the sound issue). I'd try to find an older model if you can - it will likely be better.. All reviewers Verified purchase only All reviewers Filter by:.

By JackJack #1 HALL OF FAME TOP 50 REVIEWER on 19 April 2015. Style: UK Sim Free | Verified Purchase. Having lost patience with the poor battery life of my smartphone, I was looking at buying an external battery pack (yes, another bit of junk to carry around), when someone suggested that I look at this model, because of the promise of better battery life. Granted, I only make a few short calls on an average day, but the main reason that I carry a phone is so that people can get hold of me in an emergency.

I love my new Nokia 106. If you are looking for a phone just for texting and making the occasional call, the way I do, this is the one for you. It’s just as easy to set up and operate as the Nokia 100 and has quite a few extras that may come handy. The only thing that’s difficult about this phone is removing its back. The hub of the problem is that its back part is shaped like a cradle in which the front part rests. A video on youtube shows how to go about opening the phone. But that simply wouldn’t work for me, no matter how hard I tried. Maybe it’s because I haven’t enough strength in my hands. Later I found someone on the www suggesting to stick a fingernail into the initially very tiny gap between the top of the phone and its back and wiggle it about a bit. Then stick your fingernail into the gap and gently lift first a corner of the top from it’s back part and follow that by easing the rest of the top from its cradle. As I didn't want to risk breaking a nail, I used the tip of a nail file. Magic! Since then I have also used a bland knife and that also works well. Was this review helpful to you?.

Style: UK Sim Free | Verified Purchase. Bought this as an emergency phone for our little boy in case he got lost on holiday. It is fine - a good basic phone. Only problem was we let the battery go flat and it wouldn't charge up again afterwards. I tried the trick that has worked on other cheap nokias, of taking the battery out, warming it up and putting it back in again, and eventually that worked - it didn't look like it was charging at first, so seemed to need a bit of charge before it could show it was charging!. It's ok as a spare phone but if you want one for daily use I would get the Nokia 100 which has better build quality. The 100 is just a basic phone but was good to use and reliable until I lost it.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. Talk about why you like this review, or ask a question..

Didn't like this at all proper tiny screen and very plasticky lightweight build. Knew I should have picked one up in my hand before buying but the seller was very kind and took back this phone which i sent right back after picking it up. Might be great for hipsters who are ironically revisiting tech that happened at the time of their birth but I'll stick with the 6303 now I've found the colour screen! (6303i) replacement (necessary for broken screen after half awake fumblings).. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. Talk about why you like this review, or ask a question..

Even after spending a number of hours reviewing Nokia phones I wish I had spent a bit more time and asked a few more questions. Don't get me wrong all I wanted was a simple mobile for phone calls and messaging, and this is a very neat functional phone which performs those tasks OK, and it has excellent battery life. However I bought it as a replacement for a Nokia C1-01 and I naively assumed that it would have the same functionality, although I knew it didn't have a camera. Unfortunately it doesn't have Bluetooth capability nor does it have any USB links to enable you to back up your contacts to a computer, features of its predecessor. Furthermore getting in and out of the various applications is a bit more time consuming than my old Nokia. As I say it is a very neat phone and it will have to do for now, but next time I will make sure I do a bit more research!. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?.

Style: UK Sim Free | Verified Purchase. This is a nice little mobile but I can only review it from the point of view of former Nokia 1100 owner. I got almost 10 years' service from my 1100 but it was showing its age and the screen was getting too scuffed to read texts easily. As a user who doesn't want internet access from a mobile the 106 looked ideal: everything the 1100 had plus fantastic battery life. The speaker phone, FM radio and colour display were of no interest to me. Ergonomically, the 106 seems like a backward step. The rectangular shape doesn't sit so nicely in the hand and the buttons aren't as distinct which makes it quite easy to type the wrong thing. I also think it's possible to send a text in one go by accidentally pressing the call button when adding a full stop - pressing the 1 key - but luckily I haven't managed to reproduce that one! As a feature phone it works very well but I'd have expected 10 years' to produce something to make me say, "That's progress" and it doesn't. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?.

It works surprisingly well with a good reception. Getting the back off is not quite as easy as the instructions would suggest. In fact it is quite hard to do. The easiest way is to slide your thumbnail into the crack between the back panel and the front of the phone and gently ease apart the top corner, then press on the Nokia name panel and push off the back panel..

Bought this as a gift for my mum as she's not into touchscreen phones and loves her Nokias! The phone itself is good for the price. It's not the most up to date in terms of phones, but it suits her perfectly well for texting and calling. The phone has many of the usual functions such as calculator, call logs, screening list etc. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. Talk about why you like this review, or ask a question..
