The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. High-end specs, excellent performance and an intuitive UI make this affordable Meizu a real pro.. Meizu is a rather unfamiliar name to many living in the UK, US and Australia. However, over the past few years the Chinese smartphone company has been subtlety expanding into the global market, building significant fan bases in France, Russia, Italy, Ukraine and Israel.. This gradual expansion into the Middle East and Europe is no fluke. In China, Meizu products both MP3 players and smartphones, have always been renowned for being well built and affordable.. Prices for the Meizu MX4 Pro are higher than the Chinese RRP but the MX4 Pro still offers great value for money, with the 16GB model currently available for $579 (around £380, AU$750). This price also includes shipping from Hong Kong and an international 12 month warranty.. With the use of the global Meizumart online store and localised sites for certain countries, Meizu has managed to get its products into the hands of consumers all over the world and enhance its reputation further afield.. The MX4 Pro is a supercharged version of Meizu's 2014 flagship, the MX4, and sports flagship level specs including a 5.5-inch Quad HD screen, a Samsung Exynos 5 Octa 5430 processor (the same as the one found in the Galaxy Alpha ) with 3GB RAM, 4G LTE, a 20.7MP rear camera and either 16, 32 or 64GB of internal storage.. It remains to be seen how the specs of the MX4 Pro hold up against upcoming 2015 flagships, however at present these internals are some of the best available.. Despite the numerous benefits, there are often a number of drawbacks associated with purchasing Chinese smartphones. Due to restrictions within China, Google apps and services such as the Play Store are not pre-installed on devices intended for the domestic market.. The protruding camera around back is protected by sapphire glass, unlike the one on the Google Nexus 5. Thus it's often a difficult task to get them installed and running correctly. Many of these smartphones are also not officially available in the UK, US or Australia and this results in import suppliers selling them with no international warranty, for considerably more than the Chinese retail price.. Fortunately, for anyone who wishes to purchase a Meizu MX4 Pro, the company's official 'Meizumart' store stocks devices that come preloaded with the Google Play Store and provides global shipping.. The MX4 Pro is sleek and minimal, possibly too minimal for some. Around the front things are kept simple with a 5MP front snapper, LED notification light, earpiece and physical home button. This is surrounded by a premium-feeling metallic frame, which seamlessly blends into the smooth plastic rear.. Meizu opted for a rectangular home key to increase scanning resolution. I personally like the uncluttered design, with the physical home key, but some may just see it as some sort of iPhone 6 / Galaxy Note 4 hybrid.. Meizu has slightly moved away from its common design language with the MX4 Pro, opting for the large physical home button, in order to pack in the mTouch fingerprint scanner. The result is a key that feels solid and gives a satisfying click when pressed.. The microUSB port takes up a central position on the bottom edge of the MX4 Pro, flanked by a solitary speaker and microphone. I would have liked to have seen dual front-firing speakers, similar to HTC One M8 's, on such a media-centric device.. The 3.5mm headphone jack and secondary microphone are also up top. However, thanks to the curvature of the MX4 Pro's bottom edge, the speaker is not directly covered by your hand when consuming media in landscape mode.. The sides of the MX4 Pro are rather barren to say the least, with only the volume rocker on the left. A combination of the smooth sides and plastic rear mean the MX4 Pro can be a little slippery in the hand, but not unmanageable.. Where things do start to get awkward is when trying to reach the power key on the top edge of the MX4 Pro. Given that the MX4 Pro is a rather tall device, the power button can be difficult to reach. The button itself, like the volume rocker and home key, has a great tactile and clicky feel.. If damaged, the rear cover can be easily be replaced. Although the MX4 Pro is a solidly built smartphone, with an aluminium frame, the plastic rear still makes it feel a little less premium than metal unibody devices such as the iPhone 6 and HTC One M9 .. The MX4 Pro's rear panel is removable, yet the battery is non-replaceable and there's no expandable storage slot. Taking the back off just to access the microSIM card slot seems a little excessive but this option was probably chosen to reduce production costs.. White and gold versions of the MX4 Pro are also available, which are slightly less understated than the grey model shown here.. Next Page Key features and interface.

The Meizu MX4 Pro is a smartphone designed and produced by the Chinese manufacturer Meizu , which runs on Flyme OS, Meizu’s modified Android operating system. It is a previous phablet model of the MX series, representing a more powerful version of the Meizu MX4. It was unveiled on 19 November 2014 in Beijing.. 2.2 Hardware and design. Rumors about the Meizu MX4 featuring two versions appeared even before the launch of the MX4. Leaked information confirmed these speculations and suggested that the extended version will be called MX4 Pro. In October, Meizu VP Li Nan confirmed on social media that Meizu would launch the Meizu MX4 Pro in November. This post also confirmed earlier speculations that the device will feature a 2K resolution screen. On 31 October 2015, it was reported that the upcoming Meizu device was certified by the Chinese telecommunication authority TENAA, the Chinese equivalent to the American Federal Communications Commission. According to the certification, the device would have a battery with a capacity of 3100 mAh. Furthermore, it reconfirmed that the display will support 2K resolution. The launch event for the new device in Beijing was officially scheduled for 19 November 2016. As announced, the MX4 Pro was released in Beijing on 30 June 2015. Pre-orders for the MX4 Pro began after the launch event on 30 June 2015. Over 6.7 million devices had been preordered within the two weeks after the launch. The Meizu MX4 Pro was released with an updated version of Flyme OS, a modified operating system based on Android KitKat. It features an alternative, flat design and improved one-handed usability.. The Meizu MX4 Pro features a Samsung Exynos 5430 system-on-a-chip with an array of four ARM Cortex-A15 and four Cortex-A7 CPU cores, a Mali-T628 MP6 and 3 GB of RAM. The MX4 Pro reaches a score of 54,863 points the in AnTuTu benchmark and is therefore approximately 8% faster than the Meizu MX4. The MX4 Pro is available in four different color variants (grey body with black front, champagne gold body with white front and white body with black or white front) and comes with 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB of internal storage..

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. posted by Victor H.. 4 Call quality, Battery and Conclusion. Introduction What should the ideal smartphone look like? Most of you will point out that a large and vivid display, powerful processor, a solid, refined design, and a good camera are a must. Good battery life is also essential, and so is a fast and good-looking user interface. The more demanding will point to fingerprint security as a requirement, and sound aficionados will hope for crystal clarity in music playback. Why are we listing all those wishes now and here? Simple: on paper, the Meizu MX4 Pro has got it all. Yet another high-profile handset from China, the MX4 Pro is a creation of the company Meizu, which has its root in the music industry. It’s thus no surprise that - apart from having all the basics covered - one of the key selling points of MX4 Pro is its ‘hi-fi’ audio. It also packs a fingerprint reader, but those are hardly its only highlights: it delivers with a 5.5” Quad HD, nearly bezel-less display, a powerful, octa-core Exynos 5430 system chip, a 20-megapixel main camera and a spacious 3350mAh battery. All of that at a price lower than that of a flagship from a first-tier company like Samsung and Apple. Is it all as good in reality as it looks on paper, though? Let’s find out! In the box: 2A wall charger (faster when compared to the usual 1A charger) microUSB Cable User manual Headset only included in some markets (not in our box) Design The Meizu MX4 Pro design is a display of craftsmanship with a solid build quality, thin bezels and nice in-hand feel. A sibling to the recently released Meizu MX4 , the MX4 Pro looks nearly identical in terms of design with an austere, yet stylish design. It’s noticeably taller than the MX4, but just a hair wider and thicker, so overall the difference between the two is minimal. The frame of the phone is made out of metal, but the back cover - despite its similar paint job and finish as that of the aluminum frame - is plastic. Still, the MX4 Pro is reassuringly well put together. It’s worth pointing out that Meizu has done an outstanding job cramming in a large 5.5-inch display in a very compact-for-the-size body. The bezel around the screen sides has almost disappeared - it measures just 2.8mm, a remarkable engineering achievement. Admittedly, it is a hair wider than the almost unnoticeable 2.6mm bezel in the original MX4, but nonetheless impressive. Just like on the iPhone , there is only a single physical home key where the fingerprint scanner resides on the MX4 Pro - no back button or any other traditional capacitive buttons. In order to go back in menus, you have the choice of either virtual, on-screen buttons, or an upwards gesture starting from that same physical home key. With all the marvels of a thin bezel, though, Meizu has inconveniently decided to place the lock key in a hard to reach position on the top of the phone. Luckily, this is not really an issue on the MX4 Pro - the handset can also be easily locked by holding the much easier-to-reach home key. For those times you’d use the physical keys - the lock key on top and the volume rocker on the left - you’d appreciate the craftsmanship on display as they are both metal-made and clicky. Display The 5.5” Quad HD display is sharp and features vivid, but overblown colors that are not perfectly accurate. The Meizu MX4 Pro comes with a 5.5-inch IPS LCD display with a 1536х2560-pixel resolution (Quad HD-ish). The interesting thing in Meizu’s latest phones - including the MX4 Pro - is the unusual 15:9 aspect ratio. When you hold the phone in a vertical, portrait position, this results in a wider-looking display, better fit for reading as lines of text do not appear as short and your eyes don’t have to jump between lines so often. Turn it over into horizontal, landscape orientation, though, and rather than have full-screen video, you’ll start seeing two very slim black stripes to compensate for the shorter, 16:9 common video aspect ratio. In terms of sharpness, we’re dealing with a pixel density of 546ppi here, more than enough for even the most eagle-eyed viewers who examine their displays with a Sherlock Holmesian fever. The panel is also protected by Gorilla Glass 3. What about the colors, though? At first sight, it’s obvious that images appear vibrant, with rich, juicy tones, but are they really accurate? Our analysis shows that the whites on the MX4 Pro are a bit on the cold, blue side with color temperature of around 7500K (above the reference 6500K value). RGB balance is off with overblown blues and greens, and underrepresented reds. Gamma is perfectly close to the reference 2.2 value at 2.15, so overall output is fairly well controlled throughout. Turning over to color and saturations, we see that while the MX4 Pro - admirably - sticks to the sRGB color gamut triangle, colors are purposefully blown out of proportion and look unnaturally saturated. We’ve seen way worse, but it would have been nice if the color balance was a bit better. Brightness can be cranked up really high and while we’ve seen phones filter out reflections a bit better, the MX4 Pro is definitely one that is fairly easy to use outdoors, even under direct sunlight. It’s worth noting that the brightness can also be reduced to very low levels, which is neat for night birds who value a very low minimum brightness, key to avoiding irritating your eyes. Finally, viewing angles are also nice and wide.. 5.91 x 3.03 x 0.35 inches. 150.1 x 77 x 9 mm. 5.67 x 2.96 x 0.35 inches. 144 x 75.2 x 8.9 mm. 6.22 x 3.06 x 0.28 inches. 158.1 x 77.8 x 7.1 mm. 6.04 x 3.09 x 0.33 inches. 153.5 x 78.6 x 8.5 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Meizu MX4 Pro Compare.

Except they don't share the same height, width, thickness, build materials, camera position, screen to bezel ratio, aspect ratio, screen resolution, colour measurements, operating system, camera sensors, call quality, battery life, battery size nor price. They both come from the same planet though. Is that your criterion for deciding whether or not a phone is an iPhone copycat?. (Posts: 226; Member since: 11 Mar 2014). posted on 20 Dec 2014, 01:16. Well actually the Meizu MX4 came out before the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. And the MX4 Pro looks exactly the same as the MX4. (Posts: 12; Member since: 08 Apr 2014). posted on 21 Dec 2014, 07:25.

This phone gonna work so good with high impedance headphones without extra amp. (Posts: 3806; Member since: 16 Apr 2014). posted on 21 Dec 2014, 00:59. The audio will never be good because Sony is protecting all their high end DACs and other audio equipment. Similarly, the camera on the Z series devices sucks because Sony is protecting their camera sales. It's basically management failing to realize that people who want a Sony phone, want a really good phone, not some neutered POS. Sony could be a powerhouse tech company but they are managed by the same sort of febrile morons that run TEPCO.. (Posts: 589; Member since: 20 Oct 2014). posted on 20 Dec 2014, 05:28.

Hayato Huseman May 2, 2015 1:31 am. Meizu’s a well-established brand on its home turf in China as one of the top ten smartphone manufacturers, but its reach has never really extended much past that. But we recently got the chance to see their latest hardware in the MX4 Pro, and after spending a few weeks with the handset we’re ready to give you our full review. If bright displays, sharp cameras, metal designs, and fingerprint scanners get you going, you just might want to stick around.. This review unit was provided to us by our friends at Efox-shop.com , one of Europe’s largest online retailers of electronics. Pay them a visit and tell them we sent you!. Video Review · Specs & Hardware Software · Camera · Performance · Pros/Cons Pricing/Availability · Conclusion · Scored For Me Meizu. The MX4 Pro is a bit on the large side, measuring in at 150.1 x 77 x 9 mm and 157 g. Its design is comprised mostly of metal and glass, with chamfered edges and a solid in-hand feel that gives the impression it could survive a decent fall without much more than a few scrapes —though we still wouldn’t advise it. The front of the device hosts a 5 MP front-facing camera, a small earpiece speaker, a physical home button, and a large 5.5” IPS LCD display. The screen is a bit wider than most with an unusual 5:3 aspect ratio (as opposed to the more common 16:9), and it packs an impressive 2560×1536 resolution at 546 pixels per inch. It’s one of the better IPS panels we’ve seen, with great outdoor visibility, good viewing angles, and vibrant colors. Whether you’re in broad daylight or laying in bed, the screen just pops out with its brilliant colors and thin laminate, though since we mentioned laying in bed you should probably be warned — while the MX4 Pro is able to get plenty bright for outdoor visibility, it doesn’t get as dim as some other panels we’ve tested, and while it’s not blinding, it may not be the frequent bedtime reader’s ideal phone.. The hardware controls are a bit awkwardly placed; the volume rocker sits along the left-hand side of the phone, which we usually like, but with the heavily sloped backing it’s not uncommon for your finger to fumble a bit trying to adjust the phone’s audio levels with one hand. Still, it’s not bad placement, and the rocker is pleasingly clicky and tactile; certainly not as bad as the power/standby key, located all the way up by the top-right corner. This was fine back in the days of sub-4” smartphones, but with a display as big as this one … it’s not. Meizu would’ve been better suited moving the button to the right bezel, but thankfully there are ways to get around ever needing to use the power button — more on that later.. Sitting on the backside of the MX4 Pro are the 20.7 MP f/2.2 Sony IMX220 sensor, and dual-tone LED flash. The back plate itself is a removable hard plastic with a look and feel like the metal body of the phone, and beneath it is a non-removable 3350 mAh lithium ion battery, and access to the microSIM slot … though there’s no microSD slot, so you’ll have to make due with the internal storage, ranging from 16 to 64 GB. There’s a microUSB port on the bottom bezel, flanked by a microphone and four machine-drilled speaker holes, pushing out excellent sound at a surprisingly loud volume.. Samsung’s octa-core Exynos 5 5430 SoC powers the MX4 Pro, comprised of a quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A15 and a quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A7, and the Mali-T628 GPU. There are 3 GB of RAM packed inside, and the hardware all works together to make a blazingly fast experience. There’s also support for LTE Cat 4 and WiFI 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac to ensure that that experience carries over with wireless connectivity.. Software Camera Performance Pros Cons Pricing and Availability Conclusion Scored For Me. Meizu’s proprietary Flyme (“Fly-me?” Or slime with an f?) UI takes full reign here, leaving almost no part of Android 4.4.4 unchanged. Yes, that’s KitKat, not Android 5.0 Lollipop. The interface here is highly customized, and largely bares resemblance to that of. The typical Android app drawer has been axed in favor of grid- and folder-based organization, and the gaussian blur effect seen in various window shades certainly feels familiar. But look, this isn’t just some iPhone copycat; Meizu has added some real value to their flagship offering to make it a unique and compelling phone. For starters, there are a few gestures that make the phone operable with just the physical home button, negating the need for capacitive keys altogether. If you’re used to always having a back button at your fingertips, swiping up from the home button will do the trick, or you can can enable the same function with a quick tap on the button instead. Swiping up from either surrounding side of the home button calls up Flyme’s multitasking ribbon, a simple and intuitive alternative to Google’s card-based UI that still bears the same functionality, all while avoiding obstructing the view of the current app. You can also swipe an app upwards to dismiss it, or swipe down in the ribbon to close all running processes.. The home button also serves as a fingerprint scanner. It’s fast and responsive, and you can program multiple fingers to make sure that you can access your phone no matter how you’re holding it. You can use the fingerprint scanner to bypass the security PIN/password on the lock screen, access apps you might’ve locked to keep nosy friends from poking around, and even authorize payments using Meizu’s mobile tap-and-pay system — though you’ll need a Flyme account to use that last feature. We’re also thankful for the added functionality of the home button as an alternative method for wake/standby. Like most phones with a physical home button, a simple press will wake an idle display, but long-pressing for one second also puts the screen to sleep. Once you get used to doing it, you’ll never need to use the top-oriented power button for anything but powering off the device.. If you create a Flyme account, you can also use it to access Meizu’s AppCenter and theming engine, though the MX4 Pro is quick to warn and remind that it only offers Chinese content at the moment. Whether or not it’ll offer support for more languages, only time will tell. Aside from these services, the phone ships with a pretty short list of pre-installed apps; along with the essentials, there’s a voice recorder, a file manager, a notepad, and a Painter app for simple doodles. There’s also a Security Center app that scans your device for viruses, large and junk files, and apps requesting access permissions, if you’re the sort to micro-manage your smartphone. It’s important to keep in mind that Meizu primarily intends this phone for the Chinese market, so while you won’t find much bloatware on the MX4 Pro … you also won’t find many Google apps pre-installed. In fact, the Play Store is the. Google service included out of the box, which is thankfully all you need in order to download the rest of what you might need.. The camera, as mentioned before, is a 20.7 MP Sony sensor, and man is it stunning in daylight. Shots with ample lighting look unbelievably crisp, whether you’re viewing them scaled or at 100% crop. Colors look vibrant and have an almost cinematic effect, even before enabling HDR mode, exposure composition is well-balanced, and the level of detail the camera can capture in a shot is insane. Go ahead, look at these 100% crop images and match them up to their full photos in the gallery below. There’s often a bit of over saturation going on in post-processing, but given the end result we’re not complaining. There’s also the option for 4K video capture and slow-motion video (both viewable in our full video review), but without optical image stabilization, you might be better off sticking with 1080p unless you really need the extra pixels.. The front-facing camera is decent, though not particularly noteworthy, and Beauty mode sits among the many shooting modes available on the MX4 Pro, complete with individual controls for key facial features to really personalize the hilarity it creates. Sadly, the whole shooting experience goes downhill fast once you start shooting in dark areas. Every bit of detail that makes the camera so great in bright environments is decimated into a mess of soft colors, noise, and blur. The shutter speed drops in attempt to compensate, but this just results in extremely slow capture that’ll result in you missing just about any moving shot.. Our time with the MX4 Pro was generally met with speedy performance and an overall positive experience … with a few caveats. The octa-core processor truly keeps the show running with almost no hesitation in flicking through home screens, launching apps, and running games. Features like the aforementioned gaussian blur takes up a decent amount of system resources and can be known to slow down the software in a lot of phones, but no such trouble here — the MX4 Pro is one smooth operator. All of the power packed inside this phone comes at a cost, however … battery life. With such a large-capacity battery built into the phone, one would expect long endurance and worry-free daily usage, but our testing yielded just three and a half hours of screen-on time on average. That’s certainly not the worst longevity report in the world, and it’ll be plenty enough for most users, but with most devices these days pulling much longer results with much smaller batteries, it’s a bit disappointing.. You might also want to match up the network bands supported the MX4 Pro with those of your carrier, as we were unable to pull in any higher than HSPA+ with an AT&T SIM card in the Indianapolis metropolitan area. Luckily, call quality was on the better side, pulling in strong signal and offering crisp and clear audio. Speaking of audio — a huge plus to the MX4 Pro is its high fidelity audio driver. There are four settings to choose from; auto, low gain, high gain, and line out, and each is optimized for a different audio hardware setup. We tested everything from jazz to hip hop to metal, to podcasts and movies, and in nearly every circumstance there was a noticeable difference in audio quality with Hi-Fi Sound mode enabled.. + Loud speakers and high-fidelity amp + Terrific daytime camera performance + Crisp display with great viewing angles + Fast and accurate fingerprint scanner. – Battery life decent at best – Camera very slow in low-light – Inconvenient power button placement – No expandable storage/removable battery. There’s no place to buy or even test the MX4 Pro directly in the US, but you can order one of your own online, from sites like Efox or Oppomart. Pricing varies from site to site, but you can expect to find it for around $400 USD for the baseline 16 GB model. It’s also available directly from Meizu’s website, though at a much higher price tag of $579.00 (But hey, free shipping!). No matter where you get it, doubling up the internal storage will only cost you an additional $50 each step (from 16 GB to 32, to 64). And while Meizu itself only offers the phone in gray, it can also be found and purchased in silver or gold.. The Meizu MX4 Pro is a bundle of surprises, sure to throw any longtime Android user for a loop. It’s feature-rich and elegant, and the hardware is certainly built to last. The only reservations we have with the phone rest in its network compatibility issues with US carriers and its battery life, although of course, your mileage may vary greatly depending on your carrier and usage. It’s a powerful phone at a great price, and if you can get past those two hurdles, you’ll be rewarded with the very best that Meizu has to offer.. Android , Phones , Reviews.

Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ hands-on: The devil is in the details. Meizu MX4 goes Pro with '2K+' screen and 'Retina Sound'. It wasn't all that long ago when China's Meizu unveiled its latest phone, the MX4 , but the real flagship is actually what the company announced today. As you can tell from the name, the new MX4 Pro is a beefed-up version of the earlier model, yet it's still priced very competitively and is almost just as comfortable to hold. Most notably, it has a slightly larger 5.5-inch display with a stunning 2,560 x 1,536 resolution -- a tad more than the standard 2K resolution (hence the "2K+" label), thus making this the highest screen resolution for the current smartphone market. That said, this NEGA LCD panel is apparently very power efficient, sipping just 1.05 times the power consumed by the MX4's 1,920 x 1,152 screen. Underneath that lies a Samsung octa-core processor (2GHz A15 x 4 + 1.5GHz A7 x 4) which, according to Meizu, is 20 percent more efficient than the MX4's MediaTek offering.. Gallery: Meizu MX4 Pro launch event | 34 Photos. Like Huawei and Oppo , Meizu is also adding a convenient single-touch fingerprint reader to its latest phone, except this one -- dubbed mTouch -- is placed on the front side instead of the back. As such, the old capacitive home button is gone. While each side has its own merits for the sensor's placement, this cheeky company thought this would be a good opportunity to say that it's on the same page as Apple, so much that it dedicated one slide to paying tribute to Jony Ive. Later on, Meizu's VP Li Nan admitted that this was just a stunt to get people talking, but we're certain that Apple will also have something to say about this, especially given the two companies' rocky past .. Despite the cheap shot, the mTouch does have good intentions. For one, it uses a TrustZone baked into the Samsung Exynos chip to process the fingerprint data, meaning hackers won't -- or shouldn't -- have access to it. Apple and Huawei use similar security methods for their fingerprint readers. Another benefit of mTouch is that some time in the first-half of 2015, this feature will let you make purchases with AliPay (the Chinese equivalent of PayPal) and WeChat without typing in passwords. This, surprisingly enough, is called mPay.. The "one more thing" for the MX4 Pro (oh yes they did) is its Hi-Fi audio capability, or "Retina Sound" as Meizu likes to call it (ugh). This is courtesy of the ES9018K2M 32-bit DAC (as featured on the Vivo Xplay 3S ) with its high signal-to-noise ratio, Texas Instruments' OPA1612 amplifier with its high cut-off frequency and ultra-low distortion (and it's better than the Xplay 3S' OPA2604 ), plus high-end capacitors and resistors to enable Meizu's patent-pending passive filter technology. Of course, we'll need some proper ears-on time to tell if this Retina Sound is as good as it claims to be, as well as how fast these audio chips would drain the phone's 3,350 mAh fixed battery.. As for cameras, the main one uses the same old 20.7-megapixel Sony IMX220 sensor with f/2.2 aperture, but it's now paired with an improved image signal processor that claims to further reduce noise, while still offering 30 fps continuous shooting and 4K video capture. On the other side of the phone, the front-facing camera has been upgraded to a 5-megapixel version which also supports auto-focus and 1080p video recording, though the aperture has gone from f/2.0 to a slower f/2.2.. As with the MX4, the MX4 Pro offers a simple camera interface co-developed with Tessera's FotoNation, and it offers several modes: Auto, Manual, Beauty, Panorama, Light Field (which just combines several shots taken at different focal lengths), Night, Scan (for barcodes and QR codes), Slow Motion and Microspur.. The rest of the MX4 Pro is fairly bog standard. Naturally, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WiFi along with TD-LTE and FDD-LTE networks are supported, and the phone is topped with 3GB of RAM to keep the Exynos chip well oiled. Oh, and the MX4 Pro supports NFC, which is something we wish the MX4 also included. As for software, the device is running on Flyme 4.1 (based on Android 4.4.4) which adds a couple of screen-off features: voice command plus launch apps with on-screen gestures.. Another interesting addition is SmartTouch: It comes in the form of a semi-transparent dot that goes on top of the UI, and by swiping horizontally from it you can jump between apps, whereas swiping upward from it takes you back to the home screen, and swiping downward from it pulls down the notification tray, meaning you no longer have to stretch your thumb to the top of the screen. Of course, you can always reposition the SmartTouch dot by holding down on it, or you can toggle it with the shortcut button on the notification tray.. Gallery: Meizu MX4 Pro vs MX4 | 18 Photos.

Meizu MX4 created a lot of media exposure for this Chinese manufacturer and has thus put Meizu MX4 Pro under the spotlight. This handset has leaked all over the place and we’ve seen tons of rumors regarding that phone. Meizu finally launched the device on November 19th 2014 and only 2 months after the launch of the original Meizu MX4 Pro, this Chinese OEM has yet another extremely powerful device to offer to its consumers. Meizu MX4 Pro is an improvement over the MX4 in almost every way, not that it was necessary, but Meizu still decided to launch this thing so soon after the launch of the original MX4. Meizu MX4 Pro sports a bigger higher-res screen, more RAM, a more powerful processor on the inside and a fingerprint scanner below the display. Other than that, these handset are very similar. Anyhow, let’s check out MX4 Pro’s specifications.. Meizu MX4 Pro features a 5.5-inch 2K (2560 x 1536) display along with 3GB of RAM for your multitasking needs and 16, 32 or 64GB of internal storage, depending on which model you get, of course. This handset is powered by Samsung’s Exynos 5430 octa-core processor which comes with Mali-T628 MP6 GPU for graphics processing. On the back of this handset, you’ll find a 20.7-megapixel IMX220 sensor from Sony (Exmor RS) while there’s a 5-megapixel shooter up front, OmniVision’s sensor. This device ships with Android 4.4 KitKat and Flyme OS on top of it. 3350mAh battery is also a part of this package. The device measures 150.1 x 77 x 9mm and it weighs 158 grams. This is a 4G LTE capable handset and it also sports a fingerprint scanner below the display, push-to-activate model. Handset’s initial pricing is China is as follows: 2499 Yuan ($408) for a 16GB version, 2699 Yuan ($441) for a 32GB model and 3099 Yuan ($506) for the most expensive, 64GB versions.. The original Meizu MX4 was a great product. This Chinese manufacturer managed to create a great device and offer it to its consumers at a great price point, which is always a good thing. MX4 Pro isn’t all that different, the handset is somewhat more expensive but it also offers a lot more power, perhaps even more than you’ll ever need. The build quality is top-notch and you get a really beastly spec sheet here along with a fingerprint scanner below the display. If you’d like to get a flagship handset, but you think most of them are way too expensive, MX4 Pro might be just the thing for you, so it’s definitely worth a look..

by Andrei Frumusanu on February 16, 2015 2:00 AM EST. Camera - Still Pictures and Video performance. (4x A7 @ 1.5GHz & 4x A15 @ 2.0GHz,. 5.46” 2560 x 1536 JDI "NEGA negative LCD" 546 PPI. (H) 150.1 x (W) 77.0 x (D) 9.0 mm, 158 grams. Android 4.4.4 with Flyme 4.0 UX. 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WiFi + BT 4.0, USB2.0, GPS/GLONASS. Meizu is a company that started out as a music player manufacturer in the mid-2000's and jumped onto the smartphone revolution in early 2008. While traditionally the company has targeted the Chinese market and its current phones are still prioritizing the Asian country, we're seeing increasingly strong offerings that people may want to consider in other international markets such as Europe.. The MX4 Pro marks a change in Meizu's release cadence and flagship line-up. Usually we've seen the company release only one flagship per year, and it seemed that the MX4 was that flagship this year. However, it took Meizu only two months to announce the slightly larger and higher-end MX4 Pro in November. Both phones are incredibly similar in design but employ very different innards, as Meizu goes back to their traditional choice of a Samsung-manufactured SoC and adopts a higher resolution 1536p screen over the 1156p screen in the MX4.. Before going into the design, let's go over the full specifications of the unit:. Marvell "ARMADA Mobile PXA1802" LTE modem. F/2.2 aperture, ISP 5P lens main camera. F/2.2 aperture, ISP 4P lens front camera. The MX4 Pro uses a Samsung designed and manufactured Exynos 5430 SoC. We've touched on this SoC in our review of the Note 4 Exynos , although I used the Galaxy Alpha as the comparison device in that article. This variant has 4x A7 little cores coming in at a higher 1.5GHz this time around, along with 4x Cortex A15 clocked at 2.0GHz. On the GPU side we have a Mali T628MP6 at 600MHz, same as the Galaxy Alpha. For RAM, we find 3GB of LPDDR3-1650 to enable memory management and multi-tasking capabilities.. The device comes in either 16GB or 32GB NAND variants, with no option for expandable storage as there is a lack of microSD slot. I was surprised to learn of this and am disappointed to see the omission of an added storage option, especially when considering the device has a removable back cover that could have easily offered the space for it.. Cell network connectivity is provided by sort of a new-comer in the high-end flagship segment, Marvell. The ARMADA Mobile PXA1802 LTE modem powers the MX4 Pro offering multi-band LTE capability. Unfortunately the current models of the MX4 Pro, including this review unit, only have a limited selection of FDD bands needed in western markets. European / South American and some Asian users might have luck as B3 and B7 (1800 and 2600MHz) are still relatively widely used in different countries. For European users especially it lacks the crucial 800 B20 EUDD band that provides best reception and power usage. For North American users, LTE is sadly completely out of the. question as it doesn't provide any band compatible with the local providers and connectivity is limited to HSDPA on GSM carriers.. The screen is a sizeable 5.46" JDI "NEGA" negative LCD unit with a resolution of 2560x1536. The screen comes in a slightly wider 15:9 aspect ratio, employing 96 more pixels in the width of the display compared to the usual 1440p devices we're getting accustomed to. The "negative" LCD moniker means that the crystals are in their rested default state non-permeable to light, meaning blacks should in theory consume less power compared to typical LCD screens and increase contrast.. The cameras are powered by a Sony IMX220 20.7MP sensor for the main rear unit, and an OmniVision OV5693 sensor sporting 5MP for the front facing unit.. The whole device is powered by an embedded 3350mAh. 3.8V or 12.73Wh battery that should provide quite good battery life for a device of this size.. In terms of design, the Meizu surprised me. Although its dimensions of (H) 150.1 x (W) 77.0 x (D) 9.0 mm put it only 1.6mm less wide than the Galaxy Note 4 for example, the ergonomics of the device far surpass the Note.. The rounded edges and corners of the device make for an excellent grip in the hand, making you forget that the device remains quite thick at 9mm. The 153g weight is also very good for a device of its size and provides great balance when holding it, without it getting too tiring to hold due to its weight, an issue I noticed with heftier devices such as the Mate 7 or Note 4.. Minimal side-bezels also provide a great screen to device-footprint ratio, as the MX4 Pro has the smallest side bezels I've seen on a device.. The front design reminds strongly of earlier iPhones and it's pretty evident that Meizu is trying to capture a bit of the Apple design language here. Although the front isn't very original, the sides and back are a unique design.. The device's sides are made of solid aluminum which gives the device a premium feel and cold touch sensation. The rounded sides, as mentioned, provide a good radius in their slope that makes it very comfortable to hold as it transitions towards the plastic back-cover.. What's eye-catching are several plastic inlets throughout the edges of the device, similar to what we've seen in Samsung's Galaxy Alpha and Galaxy Note 4. These are highly likely to enable the device to have better signal reception and to avoid the metal rim acting as a Faraday cage.. The bottom front face is where we find an addition to Meizu's traditional button layout, instead of a capacitive button we have a mechanical home button with integrated fingerprint sensor. The home button can be used to turn the device on by tapping it, or turn. it off by holding it for 1.5s. Additionally the fingerprint scanner can also function as a capacitive key that can be assigned a variety of functions. I've found it very natural to have it used as a capacitive back key for navigation as it frees up screen estate from the on-screen navigation bar. I'll revisit how navigation on the MX4 Pro works in just a bit.. On the bottom side of the device we find the device's main speaker pointing downwards and on the right side of the phone. The speaker is very loud and clear, much better than what we find on the Note 4 but still not near the range and depth of what can be heard on the Mate 7 or HTC BoomSound devices. On the bottom left side we have the device's main microphone with the microUSB port in the middle. I've found it disconcerting that the microUSB port is inverted compared to nearly every other device I've seen, which made me pause for a few seconds the first time I tried to attach a cable for charging before I realized what I was doing wrong. However, anyone used to the Nexus 5 or HTC phones won't have any issues with the microUSB orientation.. On the top of the device we have a secondary microphone for stereo recording and noise cancellation, flanked by the power button and the 3.5mm headphone jack. Many people would critique the top location of the power button, but given the MX4 Pro's ability to turn the screen on and off via the home button. it works relatively well as it provides an opposite location for access to the functionality when holding the device in different ways.. While most of the design is quite good, I noticed that the earpiece isn't well-designed. The front glass sits at a higher level than the earpiece, creating a little groove that is a huge dust magnet. In my experience I found the earpiece full of dust and debris in just a few days of usage. The fact that the inlay has sharp edges because of the front glass doesn't help either when trying to clean it.. The main camera is found on the upper back middle of the phone, right over a dual-tone flash system similar to what we find in many recent flagship smartphones. The camera sticks out by a millimeter and is encased in a metal ring and protected by sapphire glass.. As mentioned the back cover of the device is removable, although this does nothing in terms of functionality as it only provides access to the microSIM slot at the top of the device. The clip system is identical to what Samsung employs in their devices and offers for a solid attachment to the phone. We find the NFC antenna on the back-cover that connects to the phone via spring-contacts. It's interesting to see the actual battery in full view, but it's impossible to remove or disconnect it without further dismantling of the device. Although the battery is not removable, it certainly is still relatively easily replaceable if Meizu provides new battery packs later in the device's lifetime.. Overall, I think Meizu did pretty well in terms of design of the MX4 Pro. There's no obvious or odd features on the phone that would disrupt its simplistic formula. The device comes in four different color options, black front with either metal grey or white back, or a white front with either matte gold or white back..

Have you checked that it was not programmed with a backdoor that could access your personal information? Right? Just checking. WorldWithoutMadness - Monday, February 16, 2015 - link. What if they installed it from the hardware to software? If you don't trust these technologies then just buy your own country phone. Even if they do access your personal information, you can blame your country for it. Murloc - Monday, February 16, 2015 - link. most of the stuff in any phone is made in China so...

And invest in the stock market. theduckofdeath - Tuesday, February 17, 2015 - link. The SoC is made in Korea. Apart from that, I think Apple trolls on this site are just about as pathetic as trolls on the internet can get. Virtually all smartphones in the world are assembled in China, except for a few high end Samsung devices and maybe an LG or two. That includes brands like Microsoft and Apple. twoD - Monday, February 16, 2015 - link. While you at it, also check Apple and Google. They've known to be sharing personal info with the NSA. melgross - Monday, February 16, 2015 - link. bigstrudel - Friday, February 20, 2015 - link. All the info you need to draw your own conclusion is on the internet. Or you could keep getting all of your info spoon fed to you by corporate media who basically just want you to buy stuff and watch commercials. deadlockedworld - Monday, February 16, 2015 - link. Apple and Google have been pretty good about fighting for public transparency in their national security cooperation. Both are taking heat from the government for encrypting consumer devices and data. Its Verizon and ATT that are fully onboard with giving everything to the NSA.

The Bottom Line Though not flashy, the Meizu MX4 Pro has got what counts Buy Now on Amazon. Quad HD display Good performance with Exynos 5 Octa Great and reliable fingerprint reader Surprisingly good sound and speaker quality Camera provides a number of good modes, and above average quality. Design doesn't really stand out No expandable storage Battery not replaceable, and life uneven Lot of trouble connecting to LTE networks Camera is not the fastest shooter. With specifications and features on par with most current flagships, the Meizu MX4 Pro manages to couple high quality and an affordable price tag. The Meizu MX4 , despite its shortcomings, proved to be a solid device, but following the release of this flagship, Meizu also launched a Pro version of the smartphone that took everything that was great about its flagship counterpart and brought it to a whole other level. With specifications and features that put this smartphone at par with most current flagships, at a more than competitive price point, this latest large form-factor smartphone from Meizu certainly has a lot to offer. Here is our in-depth review of the Meizu MX4 Pro !. The MX4 Pro retains the design language of its namesake, reminiscent of the iPhone 3GS, down to a home button found at the bottom front, only in a larger form factor, courtesy of the bigger 5.5-inch display. The size puts this device just outside the realm of comfortable one-handed use, but its ultra-thin bezels along the sides of the display certainly make a difference.. As mentioned, the MX4 Pro features a physical home button up front, that offers a great tactile feel, and also comes with an integrated fingerprint scanner. The volume rocker is found on the right side, but the power button is placed at the top, which can be a little difficult to reach, given the size of the device. Up top is also the headphone jack, while at the bottom is the microUSB port and a single speaker unit. All of this is held together with a nice silver lining via the metallic frame, and while this smartphone isn’t too flashy, it does manage to have a look of its own.. The back cover sports a nice non-glossy feel and is removable, but serves as access to the SIM slot, with the battery being non-replaceable. The smooth plastic does have a tendency to slip around in the hand, further exacerbated by the accentuated curves of the MX4 Pro. There weren’t many issues with keeping a. grip on the phone, but a little extra care is definitely needed initially while trying to perform the hand gymnastics required to get around the screen. That being said, the reach required is at a minimum compared to some other large form-factor devices out there.. While there’s nothing to dislike about the MX4 Pro in terms of design, it doesn’t particularly stand out either, mostly because of its overt familiarity. Apart from its likeness to the older iPhone, the design language has largely remained the same since the MX3, made only bigger in the case of the MX4 Pro.. Luckily, the Pro moniker isn’t just to do with the larger size of the device, and shines through in other aspects as well, starting with the display. Apart from the bump in size to 5.5-inches, the IPS LCD display comes with a Quad HD resolution, but because of the aspect ratio that is slightly off kilter, the resolution is 1536p as opposed to 1440p, with pixel density of 546 ppi.. The difference is not really noticeable, and while this display is a very nice performer, it is on par with other Quad HD panels out there.. Despite the muted aesthetic of the default Flyme OS theme, colors still look vibrant and stand out due to some good contrast, as well as showcasing the sharpness of the display. Viewing angles are good, and the brightness allows for great visibility even in broad daylight. I had a great experience doing anything on this display, including gaming, and the Gorilla Glass 3 panel offers good protection against scratches.. While the MX4 featured a MediaTek processor, Meizu has replaced that in favor of the Samsung Exynos 5 Octa 5430 processor, backed by the Mali-T628 GPU and 3 GB of RAM. There were no issues in terms of performance, with the device flying through the various elements of the Flyme OS. Multitasking is also a breeze, despite the more minimalistic interface of the Recent Apps screen, but switching between applications was quick and easy.. My main enjoyment was from gaming here, as Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was nice and smooth at the default settings. The game was still playable when the graphics performance was pushed to the maximum settings, but at normal settings, the game never missed a beat.. On the hardware front, we start off with the speaker, found at the bottom of the device. While we keep talking about how much better front-facing or side mounted speaker setups are, Meizu has managed to make the sound experience on the MX4 Pro quite compelling. Not only does it get loud, but the sound stage is robust, bringing richness and body to mids and lows, something where a lot of other speakers just aren’t up to the task. With a Hi-Fi enhancement option available in the settings, the same great audio experience is available when a pair of headphones is plugged in.. Mentioned earlier was the fact that the physical home button up front comes with an integrated fingerprint scanner. This is a press type reader, which means that all you have to do is place your finger on it. What makes this implementation so good is the fact that you can wake and unlock the phone in a single motion. Press down the button to wake the device, and continue to hold it to scan your finger and unlock the device. Meizu claims that you can go from asleep. to working in about a half a second, and while we haven’t timed it, it certainly is very fast, and extremely reliable. You can also set fingerprints to unlock specific applications and other portions of the phone.. Mobile connectivity is one point of contention. While the MX4 Pro hasn’t seen an official release in this market, it was difficult to get more than 3G connectivity on AT&T and T-Mobile’s networks. Despite featuring 4G LTE support, the bands were just not compatible, while there have been other devices from foreign markets that have worked just fine. Of course, if the MX4 Pro does officially make it to the States, a compatible version will be released at the time. That said, call quality was still more than adequate.. Unfortunately, the experience was rather uneven on the battery front, despite MX4 Pro featuring a large 3,350 mAh unit. With the mobile network connectivity problems, administering a day to day battery test was difficult, but one incident worth mentioning is that the battery managed to drain itself overnight, while connected to Wi-Fi, something that happened a couple of times, even after checking whether a background app was the culprit. The frequency of this issue has reduced, but has still happened more times than is negligible. That said, the device does manage to go through a full day of use on a single charge before going into single digits, but this is of course with high-speed internet connectivity being a contributing factor to the battery drain.. When it comes to the camera, a powerful 20.7 MP rear unit provides a very solid performance on the MX4 Pro. Keeping up with the selfie trend, the front-facing camera also sports a little more power at 5 MP.. The camera application provides a slew of different modes and settings, found by swiping side to side on the viewfinder, including panorama and slowmotion video, with a fully manual mode available as well.. Settings in the auto mode include HDR, which does a pretty good job of improving color output on a shot, though without the higher saturation, this effect is essentially what Night Mode produces.. The Macro mode proved fun to use, though I found it a little odd that the Auto mode doesn’t automatically activate the macro focus, which basically allows you to focus on a close subject when the regular mode cannot. For all you selfie lovers out there, there is a Beautify Mode available that smartphones from Asian markets are known for. That said, the camera photos from the front-facing unit weren’t bad to begin with, and the Beautify Mode was a little too aggressive for my taste.. Videos can be captured in 4K resolution, and while they look good, a lack of stabilization makes shooting them a little finicky at times. As mentioned, slow motion video capture is also possible at 720p resolution at a speed of 100 fps, exported out at 25 fps.. Picture quality was actually quite good for the MX4 Pro, as details were very well captured and colors looked appealing when you could capture them correctly. I did find the exposure and the white balance in Auto mode to be a bit jumpy, needing you to be sure that what you want to capture is what you see in the viewfinder. Even in low light situations, the camera manages nice results, with HDR and Night Modes available to enhance the shot.. The only real gripe with this camera was the somewhat slow auto focusing time. The camera of the Meizu MX4 Pro may not be the absolute best comparatively, but it is far from the worst as well.. Finally, when it comes to software, we get the Flyme OS, a rather different take on Android that is a bit more simplistic than its more well known competitors.. What you see is what you get in this interface, as there is no app drawer available, requiring you to use folders if you’re looking to keep things clean and organized.. You may have noticed that there are no capacitive keys available, but contextual softkeys appear on the display when required in applications, while the home button can be used to go backward. The notification drop has a host of different options available, and different panels are used to navigate through the many options in the Settings menu. The only hidden area is the Recent Apps interface, which is accessible via a swipe up from the bottom of the screen.. Of course, everything is customisable via a theme engine, even if it will mostly be in Chinese for the moment. When it comes to translations, there are understandably a few holes in the text of the device, as there was obviously more room to foot many elements in Chinese characters, but not for the long form English phrases they mean. The literal translations themselves are a bit uneven.. That all said, what I like about the Flyme OS interface is that things are pretty simple. The contextual softkey bar that appears at the bottom remains one of my favorite aspects, as it helps keep the screen real estate open for media. Another bright spot was also the keyboard, which was easy to use, allowing me to type really quickly on it, with the useful functionality of just swiping down from the letters to easily get to numbers and symbols. There was nothing that was very overwhelming, and if you can keep things from getting too cluttered on the homescreens, everything should be fine.. Meizu’s current line of flagship devices is slowly making its way out of China and into other markets, though we don’t know if it will make it to the US anytime soon. When converting the price from Asia, the phone comes in at around $400, so we wouldn’t be surprised if the Western retail price would be closer to about $500 unlocked. It’s not a bad price point, but plenty of other phones in the Asian market have compelling experiences to offer and can rock similar or even lower price tags.. It is also a good idea to wait because of the network connectivity problems stated above, but if you do want to get your hands on it, it is available from Amazon for $610.. So, there you have it – the Meizu MX4 Pro! The MX4 Pro serves as a great example of the growth we’re seeing out of China. Just a few weeks back at CES 2015, we got to see a few high-quality but affordable devices from Chinese companies, and that is a trend that. looks to be on the rise.. Meizu is in the thick of this trend. with a phablet offering that manages to be powerful but accessible at the same time. Its design choices aside, the shell is just a casing for all of the power that is found underneath. A QuadHD display, good performance, an enjoyable sound stage, and an above average camera all make the MX4 Pro a package we do hope to see more easily available in the US soon, which should also resolve the network connectivity issues I faced during my testing. It might not stand out very much, but dig a little deeper and you’ll find a pretty fun and powerful phone in the Meizu MX4 Pro.. Meizu MX4 Pro , Smartphone Reviews.

The Meizu MX4 is a smartphone designed and produced by the Chinese manufacturer Meizu , which runs on Flyme OS, Meizu’s modified Android operating system. It is a previous phablet model of the MX series, succeeding the Meizu MX3 and preceding the Meizu MX5. It was unveiled on September 2, 2014 in Beijing.. 2.2 Hardware and design. Rumors appeared in April 2014, which stated that a successor of the Meizu MX3 was about to be released in August. Meizu later confirmed that the launch event in Beijing for September 2, 2014 [4]. At the Mobile World Congress in March 2015, Meizu has presented the Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition , which is an alternative version of the MX4 running on Ubuntu Touch , becoming the second commercially available device on this platform. As announced, the MX4 was released in Beijing on September 2, 2014. The MX4 was introduced to the Indian market on May 18, 2015. The Meizu MX4 was released with an updated version of Flyme OS, a modified operating system based on Android KitKat. It features an alternative, flat design and improved one-handed usability..

The Meizu MX4 Pro currently has an Informr score of 8.3 out of 10.. This score is based on our evaluation of 5. sources including reviews from users and the web's most trusted critics.. What's good Powerful performance Plenty of storage space Accurate fingerprint scanner Great price Beautiful display. What's bad Limited 4G LTE band support Slow camera No carrier subsidized options. In recent years, a number of Chinese manufacturers have begun offering high-quality handsets that rival even the flagships of big name carriers. The Meizu MX4 Pro is the latest example of this. Does the handset have the chops to run with the big names in mobile devices? Let’s look at some specs and reviews!. One of the biggest areas of debate on the MX4 Pro is its design. While it features a metal frame with a plastic shell, common to many popular handsets, it is particularly thick and heavy for a current-generation smartphone. Reviewers that liked a little heft loved the way the phone felt in the hand, while those that prefer a feather-light design thought the phone was dated and bulky. This will largely be a matter of personal preference. Phone Arena calls the design, “austere, yet stylish” while Android Authority believes that “The size puts this device just outside the realm of comfortable one-handed use.”. When you look at the screen on the phone, you’ll understand the added bulk. With a massive 5.5-inch 1536-by-2560 pixel display, the phone sports one of the highest resolution displays currently available. While the aspect ratio is a little odd, coming it at 15:9, Meizu claims that this is to optimize text rendering in portrait mode, a fact that many reviews reinforced. Reviews of clarity and brightness were superb, with many reviews noting the screen was even easy to see in bright sunlight. If there was anything to knock about the screen, in-depth tests at Phone Arena noted a bit of inaccuracy in colors, stating “We’ve seen way worse, but it would have been nice if the color balance was a bit better.”. Powering the MX4 Pro is a beastly octa-core 2GHz Exynos processor with 3GB of RAM. Despite being a 32-bit processor, it is one of the fastest available according to benchmarks at GSM Arena and Mobile Geeks. Reviews backed up the benchmarks with Android Authority noting that it “flies through the various elements of the Flyme OS.” Mobile Geeks was impressed as well, stating, “This isn’t a handset that I feel is going to hiccup when you’ve got 10 apps running and then get a phone call and your alarm goes off.”. The handset doesn’t support microSD cards, however with 16 to 64GB of internal storage available depending on your model, you shouldn’t find yourself lacking room for your favorite games or tracks.. One area that the phone excels is its fingerprint scanner. All reviews were very positive, some even calling it one of the best they’ve used. Phone Arena, in particular, called it “very quick and accurate.” WIth support for multiple gestures and fingerprints, it combines options and accuracy in a way that many maker’s have yet to figure out.. Powering the camera on the phone, you’ll find the same Exmor sensor used in the Xperia Z1 and Z3. At 20MP, the rear camera should offer plenty of detail and performance. Android Authority stated, “Even in low light situations, the camera manages nice results, with HDR and Night Modes available to enhance the shot.” Unfortunately, reviews also indicate that while the picture quality is quite good, there are some performance issues to worry about. All reviews pointed out that the camera was slow to take shots. It also lacks any form of burst mode. It also uses a tap focus, without any form of continuous focus or face tracking.. Powering all of the high-end hardware is a 3350mAh battery. Multiple battery tests from different sites noted you should expect performance similar to other flagship handsets, with at least a full day of use on a single charge, sometimes more. This also depends on the power profile that you choose.. Overall, the reviews of the MX4 Pro are positive. Combining a low price tag with robust hardware seems to a good way to turn heads. Phone Arena liked the device, stating, “The MX4 Pro looks like a device well worth your consideration.” GSM Arena declared “Meizu has a solid smartphone on their hands.” While Mobile Geeks called it their “Smartphone of choice” for early 2015.. The Meizu MX4 Pro is a bundle of surprises, sure to throw any longtime Android user for a loop. It’s feature-rich and elegant, and the hardware is certainly built to last.

The Meizu MX4 Pro is a bundle of surprises, sure to throw any longtime Android user for a loop. It’s feature-rich and elegant, and the hardware is certainly built to last. The only reservations we have with the phone rest in its network compatibility issues with US carriers and its battery life, although of course, your mileage may vary greatly depending on your carrier and usage. It’s a powerful phone at a great price, and if you can get past those two hurdles, you’ll be rewarded with the very best that Meizu has to offer..

Unlike many Chinese smartphones, it doesn't come with the normal risks associated with importing and though more expensive than in China, the international price still represents great value for money..... Meizu has done a wonderful job with the MX4 Pro, combining impressive build quality and raw power with intuitive software, to produce a great user experience.. Unlike many Chinese smartphones, it doesn't come with the normal risks associated with importing and though more expensive than in China, the international price still represents great value for money.. While many will be waiting to see what the first crop of 2015 flagships bring to the table, the Meizu MX4 Pro certainly is an interesting proposition for those currently looking for a high-end smartphone with a difference.. Manages to couple high quality and an affordable price tag. The MX4 Pro serves as a great example of the growth we’re seeing out of China. Just a few weeks back at CES 2015, we got to see a few high-quality but affordable devices from Chinese companies, and that is a trend that looks to be on the rise. Meizu is in the thick of this trend... The MX4 Pro serves as a great example of the growth we’re seeing out of China. Just a few weeks back at CES 2015, we got to see a few high-quality but affordable devices from Chinese companies, and that is a trend that looks to be on the rise. Meizu is in the thick of this trend with a phablet offering that manages to be powerful but accessible at the same time. Its design choices aside, the shell is just a casing for all of the power that is found underneath. A QuadHD display, good performance, an enjoyable sound stage, and an above average camera all make the MX4 Pro a package we do hope to see more easily available in the US soon, which should also resolve the network connectivity issues I faced during my testing. It might not stand out very much, but dig a little deeper and you’ll find a pretty fun and powerful phone in the Meizu MX4 Pro.. The Meizu MX4 Pro is every bit as good as the MX4 - in terms of looks and feel, build quality, connectivity and the custom Flyme OS launcher. The thing is most people probably have no idea just how good the stock MX4 is. But if the MX4 was an easy one to slip under European users' radar, the Pro version is more likely to get noticed. And for the right reasons, too.... The Meizu MX4 Pro is every bit as good as the MX4 - in terms of looks and feel, build quality, connectivity and the custom Flyme OS launcher. The thing is most people probably have no idea just how good the stock MX4 is. But if the MX4 was an easy one to slip under European users' radar, the Pro version is more likely to get noticed. And for the right reasons, too. To begin with, it's the phone with the highest-res screen in the market. Now, the real value in that is still debatable but, like it or not, QHD screens are the way to go for the industry flagships. And even if you don't care about the screen resolution, the Pro still has plenty of upgrades to offer. Meizu have returned to their traditional chipset supplier, Samsung's Exynos, which powered the MX3. It's the latest generation, of course - the Exynos 5 Octa is ticking inside the Samsung Galaxy Alpha, too. An improved camera and a well-behaved and feature-rich fingerprint-scanning solution are other definite points in favor. A high-res selfie cam is not to be frowned upon either. It's a tight and focused list of improvements that cover just about everything that could have been better about the MX4. The obvious exceptions are the non-removable battery and the lack of memory expansion. Unfortunately, the 64GB version isn't widely available - just like it is for the stock MX4.. Nice design, excellent audio, and smooth performance. The Meizu MX4 Pro builds up on the successful formula of the Meizu MX4: it keeps the signature simplistic, good-looking design and the futuristic minimal screen bezel. At the same time, Meizu is out competing with top flagships here: it includes a flagship-grade Quad HD display that looks fine, an adequate system chip, as well as a fast and reliable fingerprint scanner. In addition to all this, sound quality on the MX4 Pro is great and will please audiophiles. All of this works admirably well on the sleek and modern-looking Flyme Android skin....

The only area where Meizu could have done a better work is the camera: the 20-megapixel shooter is not bad by any means, but it is much slower than you’d expect and has some issues with focusing and overall photo presentation. The MX4 Pro is the most expensive phone in Meizu’s lineup with a recommended price of $400 (2499 yuan) for the base model, which is around the typical cost of a China-made flagship device, and much more affordable than a similar smartphone from a well-established global company like Apple or Samsung. Resellers are likely to sell this for no less than $500 to the Western world, but even at that price, the MX4 Pro looks like a device well worth your consideration..

by Andrei Frumusanu on February 16, 2015 2:00 AM EST. Camera - Still Pictures and Video performance. The Meizu MX4 Pro is certainly an interesting device. There is no doubt that most readers will consider the most characterizing facet of the device the fact that this is a phone by a Chinese manufacturer who has yet to make a reputation for itself in the western markets. Trying to diverge from the well-known formula by employing a more radical customization of Android, Meizu nevertheless manages to put out a very solid product.. FlymeOS, while still lacking polish and distinguishing functional features, still manages to serve as a good OEM skin. The stock launcher is definitely the weak point but doesn't hinder the user from easily installing 3rd party software to get the application drawer back. I'm happy with Meizu's permission manager and see it as an important addition to the core OS that cannot be easily reproduced by other means. The interface is clean and the design language is attractive. Translation mishaps here and there are being progressively fixed by the continuous updates that the phone seems to receive since I got the sample unit. It's Meizu's services and ecosystem that need. a more drastic effort as they completely lack. In terms of phone hardware, the MX4 Pro really seems to shine. The semi-metal build is extremely solid and gives an excellent premium feel to it, without having to sacrifice too much weight or texture due to the plastic back that in my opinion is well suited for the device. However, I miss the microSD card slot and given the device's internal build and I really wonder why Meizu chose to omit it.. Meizu's fingerprint sensor implementation works just as well as Apple's, and due to the dual-function as both mechanical home-button and capacitive function key brings a new way of navigation that, at least in theory, seems improved over previous Meizu models.. Meizu's choice of continuing with Samsung's line of SoCs is. no disadvantage compared to the competition. The Exynos 5430 will probably remain as the most power efficient SoC of the existing A15 generation. A57 SoCs are just around the corner and one may question the choice of. going forward with the purchase of a last-generation architecture device, but I've proven that in terms of perf/W the Exynos 5430 leads the newer generation 5433. Unfortunately, the raw performance of the SoC is. often wasted by poor software optimizations in the OS. If you're running non-native applications, you might not see the full potential of the hardware. I hope an eventual Lollipop update will fix these issues.. It's on the GPU side that performance may not be totally satisfactory due to the Mali T628MP6. Here a more robust GPU such as the Adreno 420 found in the Snapdragon 805 would have been a better fit for the QHD screen.. When it comes to the MX4 Pro's display, the 5.46" JDI panel is a double-edged sword. Delivering excellent maximum brightness and amazing low-light night reading modes at the same time, and the outstanding sharpness of the 1536p 546PPI resolution, are feats that could be overshadowed by the inaccurate and oversaturated colors of the default calibration that Meizu decided to employ. In terms of screen size, I think Meizu hit the upper limit of the sweet-spot for one-handed use as the sloping sides make for a very comfortable one-handed grip of the phone.. The choice of SoC, efficient display, and a large 3350mAh battery make for remarkable battery life on the Meizu. Gaming may get a little bit hot due to the GPU, but other everyday usage easily competes with top-performing devices.. The camera performs well, but don't expect it to quite reach the quality of OIS contenders such as the G3, Note 4, or iPhone 6 Plus. Compared to what the Huawei offered in the Honor 6 and Mate 7, there is however a noticeable improvement in quality.. A big detractor is the cellular network support.. If you live in North America, you will not get LTE support. Europeans will be more lucky to see either 1800 or 2600MHz band support on their carriers. Until Meizu specifically targets a model with more global band support, this will remain a unit that is best served on the Chinese mainland. It is a pity as the Marvell modem seems to behave quite well in my subjective usage.. When it comes to deciding whether the. MX4 Pro is worth buying, again it comes down to price. The device can be found through various web-shops internationally starting at $499 or ~380€ for the 32GB model, with the 16GB going for even less. I think Meizu hits a reasonable performance/price level that makes the MX4 Pro a more attractive choice than competing devices at its level. The Nexus 6 and Mate 7 both under-perform in everything but software and sheer screen size, while the Note 4 or iPhone 6 vastly out-price the Meizu putting them in a different category. Overall, if you can make due with the LTE bands, I think the MX4 Pro is a solid phone that is worth considering.. Camera - Still Pictures and Video performance.

Have you checked that it was not programmed with a backdoor that could access your personal information? Right? Just checking. WorldWithoutMadness - Monday, February 16, 2015 - link. What if they installed it from the hardware to software? If you don't trust these technologies then just buy your own country phone. Even if they do access your personal information, you can blame your country for it. Murloc - Monday, February 16, 2015 - link. most of the stuff in any phone is made in China so...

Apart from that, I think Apple trolls on this site are just about as pathetic as trolls on the internet can get. Virtually all smartphones in the world are assembled in China, except for a few high end Samsung devices and maybe an LG or two. That includes brands like Microsoft and Apple. twoD - Monday, February 16, 2015 - link. While you at it, also check Apple and Google. They've known to be sharing personal info with the NSA. melgross - Monday, February 16, 2015 - link. bigstrudel - Friday, February 20, 2015 - link. All the info you need to draw your own conclusion is on the internet. Or you could keep getting all of your info spoon fed to you by corporate media who basically just want you to buy stuff and watch commercials. deadlockedworld - Monday, February 16, 2015 - link. Apple and Google have been pretty good about fighting for public transparency in their national security cooperation. Both are taking heat from the government for encrypting consumer devices and data. Its Verizon and ATT that are fully onboard with giving everything to the NSA.

I have got this model over 2 years. Few month ago baterry had colapsed. After changing it according to youtube video instruction it seemed to be ok. Then I upgraded Flyme OS to higher version. At first it seems ok, but after a while this phone becomes slow,it takes quite some time to answer a command.It's not as good quality as it sounds when reading the specifications.. I really love the interface of this phone but the front camera is a disappointment and the phone gets hot easily like reallyyyyy HOT..

Meizu MX4 Pro May Give New Life To Ubuntu Touch. October 7, 2014 at 1:25 PM. After a fe w rumors that Meizu may be using Ubuntu Touch as its "stunning new OS," there seems to be some confirmation that the rumors are real after what appears to be a Meizu MX4 Pro device was spotted in the wild running Ubuntu touch.. The Meizu MX4 Pro is rumored to come with a 5.4" screen, a 20nm Exynos 5430 from Samsung (the same one that the Galaxy Alpha uses), a 20MP camera (likely from Sony) and 3 GB of RAM. There was a leaked spec sheet pointing to 4 GB of RAM, which technically would be possible even with a 32-bit chip like the Exynos 5430, through an extension, but right now that makes little sense until 64-bit chips arrive on the mobile market.. We haven't heard about Ubuntu Touch for some time, ever since Canonical (the company building the OS) failed to raise $32 million for its Ubuntu Edge smartphone with a sapphire screen. Canonical only managed to raise $12.8 million through its IndieGoGo campaign, and the project was cancelled.. The campaign wasn't necessary to build the phone, as Canonical should have had enough money for that regardless, but it was more of a test to see if there was enough demand. Because less than half of the money was raised, Canonical must've felt the project was too risky to do on its own.. Unlike Firefox OS, which seems to have gathered a few partners for the launch of a handful of devices so far, Ubuntu Touch hasn't been nearly as "successful." That's despite the fact that Firefox OS is an operating system that uses only web technologies, much like Chrome OS, while developers can build native apps for Ubuntu Touch.. Canonical has also ensured that Ubuntu Touch is easily ported to hardware that runs Android. This will make it easy for Canonical -- as well as other companies -- to port Ubuntu Touch to Android devices. If the porting effort is minimal, then OEMs should be more inclined to try it out (or so the theory goes).. Meizu may finally give Ubuntu Touch the chance to prove itself. There will still be market roadblocks, such as having too few apps at launch, which could make the Meizu more of a device for enthusiasts and hardcore Linux fans as opposed to average consumers. Yet if the OS impresses, it may develop a following; if it catches on in a country with a burgeoning mobile market like China, that could be a very good thing.. Lucian Armasu is a Contributing Writer for Tom's Hardware US. He covers software news and the issues surrounding privacy and security.. Create a new thread in the US News comments forum about this subject. This thread is closed for comments. I'd like to quell some misconceptions. The sole purpose of the Ubuntu Edge Indiegogo campaign was to gauge interest levels at that very early stage of Ubuntu Touch's life. $12.8 million is certainly nothing to be scoffed at. "Ubuntu Touch hasn't been nearly as successful [as Firefox OS in gaining OEM partners]". It has been confirmed time and again by Canonical employees that Ubuntu Touch has very strong support from OEMs. The delay is being caused by Canonical themselves because they want initial Ubuntu Touch impressions to be as close to flawless as possible. They have openly stated time and again that the first devices by Meizu and bq will be enthusiast devices, built primarily for developers and tech savvy people in order to build up the platform before they start mass production. As far as apps are concerned, Ubuntu Touch is the first platform that properly respects web apps, Out of the box Ubuntu Touch will have more apps than both Android and iOS. Still native apps are always nicer than web apps and they're giving developers the time they need to build those native apps.. 4GB on a 32bits device is perfectly fine: on a PC, the 32bits memory space is full of holes due to external devices mapping their own RAM in system memory and the GPU is usually the biggest culprit at 256MB-1GB but in an SoC, most of those subsystems use system RAM instead of having their own so nowhere near as much address space goes to waste. Individual apps may only be able to see 2-3GB but the system should be able to use close to the full 4GB..

All supported devices are listed here. does anyone know the source where can i buy this one?. The MX4 Ubuntu edition seems to be sold out at the moment (January 2016).. Meizu has the same hardware in both versions of MX4 (Android and Ubuntu touch), so in theory you could flash Ubuntu touch on an Android version.. There are some instructions on how to do this on the net e.g. However, since this will void your warranty and is not guaranteed to work, it is something you might not want to try on a new phone.. answered Jan 30 '16 at 8:50. If you do buy an andriod one and then flush it, it would be very interesting to know how you got on. It seems like a lot of people still want to get their hands on the currently out of stock Pro 5. So if this works it could be a good way to go forward with a phone that has a nice spec. I would personally be very keen to know how this goes.
