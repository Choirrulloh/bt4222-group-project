The ZenFone 4, the newest smartphone from ASUS, has been improved a lot from its previous model, the ZenFone 3, and it also has a totally different design. Looking at where it has been improved, we would like to report its usability.. The display is bigger, and the finger print sensor is now located at the front. There is no "bump" for the camera lens. Tech specs that have been improved a lot from its previous model. The ability of newly equipped dual-lens camera. New function of newly introduced ZenUI 4.0. ASUS launched the ZenFone 4, the newest ZenFone series phone. Its basic specification has been improved a lot from the ZenFone 3, and it has a completely different design; the display is bigger, the position of the fingerprint sensor is changed, and so on. It has a dual camera with standard and wide angle lens, so you can take photos as high quality as the ones taken with a high-end machine.. The ZenFone 4's LCD is 5.5 inches whereas its previous model was 5.2 inches. The device itself is bigger; there is not so much difference in width, but it is longer vertically by about 8.6 mm. The resolution remains the same with FHD 1080 x 1920, but because the display is bigger, it has better visibility, which makes browsing the Internet, watching photos and movies easy.. The display is a 5.5-inch FHD IPS LCD. It is not OEL which is used with the newest high-end models, but it still has high contrast and looks bright. Corning Gorilla Glass 3, toughened glass with shock resistance performance, is used.. The one on the left is the ZenFone 4, and the one on the right is the ZenFone 3. The ZenFone 4, which is bigger, has better visibility of letters.. It is bigger, but it still fits in my hand; I don't find it difficult to hold. Of course you would feel uneasy at first when you replace the ZenFone 3 with this, but you should get used to it right away.. Another big change they made with its look is its fingerprint sensor. It used to be located on the back, but it is moved to the bottom front. It is also used as a home button. With the previous model, when I had the phone on my desk with the screen side up, I had to pick up the phone everytime in order to touch the fingerprint sensor on the back, but with the ZenFone 4, I can leave it on the desk when unlocking.. The fingerprint sensor is located at the bottom front with the ZenFone 4, and it also is used as a home button. When it was on its back, I unlocked it with my index finger or middle finger, but now because it is on its front, I can use my thumb or index finger to operate.. The earphone jack is moved from the top surface to the bottom surface.. It has two cameras on its back; one with standard lens, and another with wide-angle lens. It can be said that the big change in the design with the ZenFone 4 is that it no longer has a camera bump. Also, because the fingerprint sensor is now on its front, its back looks very simple. The ASUS logo is now in the middle on its back whereas it was on the bottom. It still has a concentric-circle pattern which was designed with the image of Zen.. There is no camera bump or fingerprint sensor on the back. It looks simple and sophisticated overall. Now I don't have to worry that it might bend when I operate leaving it on the desk.. The ZenFone 4 has Snapdragon 660 for CPU (2.2 GHz), and its memory is 6 GB with 64 GB storage. Its OS is Android 7.0, but it is planned to be upgraded to Android 8.0. DSDS (Dual Sim Dual Standby) cannot be used with microSD card, but it should be practical enough as it has 64GB storage. SIM card slots have been changed to two nano SIM slots where as it was 1 micro SIM slot and 1 nano SIM slot with the ZenFone 3.. I did AnTuTu Benchmark test, and it scored 112017, which is twice as good as the ZenFone 3's 62779. It is very fast to launch apps and the camera, and it never gets unstable even when I multitask using several apps. I felt it has performance as good as high-end devices.. It scored 112017 with AnTuTu Benchmark.. The biggest characteristic of the ZenFone 4 is its camera equipped with dual lens. It has a main camera equipped with Sony flagship IMX362 with 1.4µm large pixel size and F1.8 aperture (12 megapixels) and it also has a 120 degree wide-angle camera (8 megapixels). You can switch between these cameras with one touch. Especially the wide angle camera should be useful for photographing scenery and commemorative photos with a lot of people. It is very convenient that I can hold the main camera and then change it to the wide-angle camera if I want to with one single touch. The main camera focuses on objects very fast even in dark environment, so I can photograph the moment I want to without handshakes. On the other hand, the wide-angle camera has less megapixels than the main camera, and low image quality was obvious when I took photos in dark environment. Having said that, both cameras support manual photo shooting, portrait mode, 4K movie recording and so on, so you should be satisfied with its overall camera performance.. The left is the main camera, the middle is the wide-angle camera, and the right is RGB sensor and LED flash.. Taken with auto mode of the main camera. HDR is working well, and it has strong color with high contrast.. When you tap the icon of mountains, you can switch between the main camera and the wide-angle camera.. The left photo was taken with the main camera, and the right with the wide angle camera. The wide angle camera allows you to take twice as wide range as the standard lens even when you photograph from the same spot. But when you use the wide angle camera, it gets warped more.. With the main camera, you can photograph focusing on objects quickly and without handshakes even in dark environment.. You can take photos without shakes even when you take photos with your camera handheld in dark environment like streets at night time. Because you can take bright photos, it is perfect for taking photos on night streets.. The left is taken with auto mode and the right with portrait mode. Portrait mode with the iPhone 7 Plus makes bokeh effect by measuring depth of field by using its telescope camera and wide-angle camera, but the ZenFone 4 makes bokeh effect with its software. So I couldn't use portrait mode with things like a soft toy which cannot be recognized as a face. Also, I couldn't use it with profile either, so I hope this will be improved in the future.. I took this with pro mode, which allows you to adjust white balance, exposure, ISO and shutter speed freely. If you can use this fully, you can take magical photos.. The ZenFone 4 has an original interface that is used with ASUS Android devices, the ZenUI's newest version Zen UI 4.0. There are 13 standard apps and 3 third party apps at initial state, which means it has less than the ZenFone 3. There are new functions like sharing where you are with an app or pressing the home button three times to make a emergency call, but the most useful feature is the Twin app function which allows you to use one app with two accounts at the same time. For example, if you are using two SIM cards for work and private using DSDS, you can use two LINE accounts assigned with each SIM card on the ZenFone 4. This is a very considerate function which has never existed.. Twin apps allow you to log in with two different accounts with SNS apps like Facebook, Instagram and LINE, which you only can use one account with one device. When you able this, it creates copies of the same app on your phone, and you can use them with different account each.. The ZenFone 4 is suitable as the newest model of the series with its design and performance improved a lot from the ZenFone 3. What I am not fully happy about is its price being JPY 56,800 (about PHP 28,000). Because the ZenFone 3 was JPY 39,800 (about PHP 19,500) when it first debuted, I assume many people would find the ZenFone 4 expensive. But considering its performance which scored twice as good as the ZenFone 3 with the benchmark test, and a dual-lens camera which allows you to photograph as good as high-end devices, you would feel this would be reasonable..

Asus ZenFone 4 ZE554KL Smartphone Review. Daniel Schmidt ( translated by Richard Schultheis), 12/04/2017. Android Smartphone Touchscreen. With the fourth generation of the ZenFone series, Asus challenges a fiercely contested submarket by not only offering competitive pricing but also by providing their latest offering with a strong camera. Moreover, ZenUI has taken a great leap forward, making it seem positively grown up!. » Multimedia , » Gaming , » Lightweight Gaming » Budget Office , » Business , » Workstations » Subnotebooks , » Ultrabooks , » Convertibles. Top 10 under 300 Euros , ». Best Notebooks for University Students ». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series ». » Tablets , » Windows Tablets » Smartphones. With the new ZenFone 4, Asus launches an upper-middle class smartphone with a 5.5-inch screen coming in the typical 16:9 screen ratio. the ZenFone 4 comes with the Snapdragon 630, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory (Germany). A Pro version is due to come out by the end of the year. This Pro version will come with a Snapdragon 835 and will be the first ever smartphone to have ad-WLAN. ASUS’ new phone is all about its camera: its dual-lens camera uses Dual Pixel technology and is capable of wide-angle shots. This makes it a direct competitor of LG’s G6, which, at the time of this review, is even more affordable.. Although the price range of about €500 houses few competitors, flagship smartphones of the previous generations such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, the LG G6 and Huawei’s P10 can be found around there. The BQ Aquaris X Pro tries to fill the same niche, but its SRP is lower by around €100 (~$118).

In Germany, Asus offers the phone in black and white, with another mint-green variant being available internationally. The device’s design is appealingly sleek and simple, its camera is flush with the case, so that it can be put down flat on a table. Corning Gorilla Glass protects both front and back of the phone, making it prone to slide from surfaces that are not completely level. Although smudges and fingerprints appear visibly on the phone’s surface, they can be removed easily.. The ZenFone’s build quality is good and its frame makes it a robust device that is resistant to bending. The frame’s spacing is even and it fits to the phone's body snugly, just as we like it. The card slot cover is flush with the case and made from the same material, with the inner card slide being made from plastic. It either takes two Nano-SIM cards or one Nano-Sim card and a micro-SD card.. The phone’s battery is built in and its case is not IPA-certified..

The ZenFone’s USB C port actually houses a USB C 2.0 interface, which does not interconnect with display cables. It is, however, capable of OTG and can connect to external storage devices and peripherals.. The microSD slot takes cards up to a capacity or 2 TB, which is the maximum capacity denominated by the SDXC standard. At the time of this review the largest available microSD-cards store about 400GB. The ZenFone 4 cannot format microSDs for use as internal memory or transfer apps to them.. The device also supports wireless communications via VHF-band, Miracast Wi-Fi Direct, NFC and Bluetooth 5.0. Bluetooth 5.0 is utilized only after an update to Android 8.0 Oreo, with Bluetooth 4.2 being used otherwise.. The ZenFone 4 comes with Android 7.1.1 Nougat and the new ZenUI 4.0 pre-installed. At the time of this review, the phone’s security standards were up to date, with the latest update having been delivered on October 1st 2017. During the time of this review, we noticed regular updates to this phone’s system. Its update to Android 8.0 Oreo is to be rolled out in 2018.. The new ZenUI 4.0 seems to be more cleaned up and less experimental than 3.0. Its user interface provides many features: the AI-supported gallery feature can automatically sort pictures by face recognition or group photos. The so-called Safeguard function can send the device’s location to a pre-defined contact in case of emergency so help can arrive more quickly. Furthermore, it is now possible to duplicate apps, so one can use multiple accounts comfortably. Altogether, ZenUI’s smooth experience and many useful features satisfied our expectations.. The Asus ZenFone 4 accesses the internet by LTE Cat 13 on the go, meaning that it is capable of 600 Mbit/s download and 150 Mbit/s upload maximum. The number of bands supported by the device is also very good. If 4G were unavailable at a time, it would still be able to connect to a wide variety of 3G-bands and Quad-Band-GSM. Connection quality was just fine and, altogether, above criticism.. The ZenFone 4 supports the IEEE-802.11-standards a, b, g, and ac and both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks. In direct comparison to our reference router Linksys EA8500, the device did convince us and achieved consistently good results in sending and receiving data, which could only be improved with MIMO-antenna technology. Its reception range was decent too, with it being capable of streaming HD video content 12 meters (~39 ft) away from the router and separated by an exterior wall..

The smartphone supports various satellite constellations: GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo. In our review, the ZenFone 4 also received position data from the Japanese network QZSS. Satellite fix was achieved within two seconds and was accurate within three meters (~10 ft). A relatively accurate fix was possible, even within buildings.. We put the ZenFone 4 through its paces alongside the Garmin Edge 500 with the mandatory bike ride. The recorded route is comparatively accurate, with the only noticeable divergence happening at the ascent to the embankment. The measured total distance also deviates only slightly from our cycling computer’s recording.. The call app has been refined by ASUS and using it will not be a challenge to anyone. The contacts tab is now accompanied by a tab for groups and the related menu provides fast access to numerous useful features.. The Asus ZenFone 4’s call quality is good overall. Held close to the ear, both conversational partners are transmitted clearly. The phone's speaker is decent as well, although it sounds a bit tinny. Asus’ own Noise Reduction technology performs quite well. Unfortunately, the phone does not support VoLTE and VOWi-Fi in Germany.. The ZenFone 4’s front camera features a sensitive 8 MP sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. It performs adequately in everyday use. Daylight shots turn out well and there is even the option of using a versatile beauty filter or a portrait mode. This portrait mode is supposed to simulate better depth perception, but does not quite achieve it. In adverse lighting conditions, picture quality deteriorated slightly, although the resultant pictures were still decent enough to use for social media.. The rear-facing dual camera features one 12 MP sensor and one 8 MP sensor. The main lenses’ focal length is 25 mm (83° wide-angle). Its sensor is the Sony IMX362, which is also utilized by the Moto Z2 Play and the HTC U11. Pictures in daylight come out notably well with this light-sensitive camera, even better than with the OnePlus 5, which has overexposure problems with depicting larger, bright surfaces. Finer details especially seem to come out better with the ZenFone 4’s camera. In bad lightning conditions, the large, light-sensitive pixels of the phone’s sensor and its optical and digital image stabilization perform well, as we could ascertain on our test device. At maximum zoom, image noise levels are higher than with the Note 8, but lettering is depicted more cleanly and with less pixelation. The second camera lens has a wider focal length at 12 mm (120°) and is less light-sensitive. The differences between these two lenses are like night and day, however, so we do not recommend using it for anything other than landscapes or architecture and panorama shots. The dual-camera’s shutter delay is small enough that it is suitable for point-and-shoot-use. Super Resolution Mode takes pictures with up to 49 MP. The camera’s pro mode offers a multitude of options for manual adjustment.. Videos are recorded in ultra HD at best (30 FPS, EIS), although unfortunately, the second lens cannot be used for this purpose. This does not impact the video-recording experience in low-light conditions however, since the light-sensitive lens by itself produces visible image noise and the autofocus behaves erratically already. Nevertheless, in daylight conditions and only slightly dark scenes, the camera performs well. Moreover, there are time lapse mode (max. 4k) and slow-motion mode (1080p @ 120 FPS or 720p @240 FPS)..

We checked the ZenFone 4’s color accuracy under normalized and controlled conditions with our ColorChecker Passport. The images were processed without further editing. We found that whites were slightly warmer and grays brighter than in the original. Colors were slightly oversaturated and browns had a slight red hue.. Our test chart photo shows great quality in the image center, with high levels of detail discernible. The depiction of lettering on darker surfaces or color gradients turned out particularly well, with hardly any pixelation. On the other hand, sharpness drops considerably on the left side of the picture.. The package includes a modular charger (5V, 2A), a USB cable, and a tool for the SIM-card, a headset, a silicon bumper and a short user manual.. In Germany, Asus offers a 24-month warranty for the ZenFone 4.. The capacitive touchscreen of the ZenFone 4 can recognize ten simultaneous activations and has an agreeably smooth surface that makes sliding across it easy. Additionally, the touchscreen’s precision is high, with even light touches being recognized. An optional glove mode can be activated through the device’s settings.. The phone utilizes Asus’ own ZenUI-keyboard, which is replete with features, but takes a lot of space on the screen. Especially in landscape mode nothing of the input text remains visible. Those who prefer other keyboard layouts can always install different ones from the Google Play Store.. The device’s fingerprint sensor is integrated into the frontal home button and unlocks it reliably and fast. Unlocking it this way in standby mode directly opens the home screen.. The Asus ZenFone 4’s 5.5-inch IPS display’s resolution is 1920x1080 (16:9). The panel’s image is crisp and its vivid colors and contrast levels are convincingly good. This impression was verified by our test results. The average brightness is at a very high 634. The results remain constant even with the device’s ambient light sensor activated or in the APL 50 test. The screen’s good black level (0.4 cd/m²) provides for a very good contrast ratio.. One shortcoming of the screen is the use of Pulse Width Modulation for brightness regulation.. The frequency is so high; however, that hardly anyone should be troubled by it.. 628 cd/m² 645 cd/m² 618 cd/m² 645 cd/m² 656 cd/m² 617 cd/m² 656 cd/m² 636 cd/m² 608 cd/m². 93 % Center on Battery: 656. cd/m²) ΔE Color 5.3 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 5.2 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.22.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 11360 Hz ≤. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 11360. Hz (Likely utilizing PWM) Flickering detected at a brightness setting of 35. There should be no flickering or PWM above this brightness setting.. Hz is quite high, so most users sensitive to PWM should not notice any flickering.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9144 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. We measured the display with the CalMAN software and a spectrophotometer. The ZenFone 4 has various color settings, with a blue light filter and modes such as ‘balanced’, ‘vivid’ and even one that enables the user to manually set color hue and saturation available. We tested the modes ‘balanced’ and ‘vivid’. The panel aligns itself with the sRGB spectrum in all modes. Both tested modes displayed colors with a slight shift to cooler shades, which should be possible to correct with color temperature adjustment. Blues in particular are displayed too vividly, causing higher deviations with shades of blue, while reds are somewhat undersaturated in ‘balanced’ mode. ‘Vivid’ mode produces vivid colors, particularly when displaying photos. At no time the color deviations were found to be disturbing.. The display’s feature to automatically adjust its color temperature to ambient light was particularly useful in everyday use..

This means that the measured response time is worse than the average of all tested devices (42.2 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Outdoors, the Asus ZenFone 4's screen performs very well, probably due to its high brightness. Its surface is slightly reflective, but we are used to worse and with a direct viewing angle, the display quality should not be impacted negatively, at least as long as it is not exposed to direct sunshine.. The viewing angles of the Asus ZenFone 4’s IPS panel are as good as expected. No color shift was detected, so there should not be limitations in normal use cases. Only with shallower viewing angles there is a reduction of perceived brightness.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The Asus ZenFone 4 is the very first smartphone equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 (14 nm process) that we have examined. The octa-core CPU has not changed noticeably and consists of Cortex-53 cores, which are clocked at up to 2.2 GHz. The integrated graphics unit Adreno 508 is a new addition, however, and is marketed to perform up to 30% better compared to its predecessor, even with identical clock rates. The ZenFone 4 now supports and carries 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM.. In Geekbench, the ZenFone4 is slightly outperformed by the Snapdragon 626 on both the Moto Z2 Play and the Aquaris X Pro, which might be due to the different versions of Geekbench used, considering that both CPUs have nominally identical architecture and performance. The Snapdragon 630 also performs slightly worse in the Physics benchmark of 3DMark. None of these three can compete with the performance of high-end smartphones.. The higher performance of the GPU is immediately noticeable. In GFXBench, the Adreno 508 was between 30 and 51% faster than its predecessor, and even between 37 and 92% in 3DMark. Thus, the GPU is positioned evenly with the Adreno 510 or the ARM Mali-T880 MP4.. The ZenFone 4’s system performance is no match for high-end smartphones, but it stands up well to its direct competition and our test results confirm our good impression of the device’s smooth UI. Despite the elaborate ZenUI, the smartphone performs faster than the Z2 Play or X Pro, which rely on android’s stock UI.. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) Asus ZenFone 4 ZE554KL.

The Asus ZenFone 4’s eMMC memory is not among the fastest options. It performed averagely in most tests, but was exceedingly bad at writing small data blocks, which impacts the overall test result negatively. This also results in noticeable slowdown when installing apps and updates. The device’s 64 GB of memory is reduced to 54 GB of usable memory after the initial startup. Media and photos can be stored on the optional microSD card.. We tested the microSD slot’s speed with our Toshiba Exceria Pro M501 reference card (max. The card remains underutilized, but the smartphone’s microSD slot still is fast in comparison to some competing devices..

The Asus ZenFone 4 performs at a decent level, with all current APIs being supported. At present, no game from Play Store is expected to force reduced video quality settings. The phone comes equipped with Asus’ Game Genie, which is supposed to enhance game performance and can record and stream game sessions. There is also a lock mode which prevents accidental screen switching and a macro key function that can automate in-game functions.. Generally, the ZenFone 4 can be said to be a good companion for gaming on the go. The player’s input is processed precisely and the additional frontal speakerphone compensates when the second one on the lower edge is covered.. in comparison Lenovo B (min).

The Asus ZenFone 4’s two speakers’ sound quality is very high. One is located at ear-level and the other one at the lower edge of the smartphone. The device can be quite loud with 82 dB(A). What is more important, however, is its sound, and especially with mids and highs, the speakers deliver. Only the somewhat lacking bass impacts the overall sound volume and its lows.. Alternatively, the sound can be output through the 3.5 mm headphone jack, which transmits a clear and smooth signal. With DTS Headphone:X and high-resolution audio output (192 kHz/24-Bit), the ZenFone 4 is a pleasure to listen to. The included headset does not impress, but delivers a surprisingly balanced sound pattern. Those who prefer wireless playback over Bluetooth will be pleased that the device supports aptX HD.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 35.2 36.2 25 32.9 29.2 31 37.2 28.4 40 31.7 35 50 39.6 33.4 63 28.3 29.9 80 27.3 29.6 100 26.9 28.9 125 26.7 27.5 160 24 32.7 200 20.9 43 250 20.9 47.9 315 19.5 50 400 18.5 57 500 17.5 65.5 630 17.5 66.7 800 15.7 72.2 1000 15.8 69.6 1250 16.6 70 1600 15.8 70.3 2000 15.4 69.6 2500 15.5 72.9 3150 16 72.5 4000 15.8 68.1 5000 16 69.9 6300 16.3 71.8 8000 16.3 69.4 10000 16.2 64.3 12500 16.4 61.1 16000 16.4 55.5 SPL 28.6 82.2 N 1.1 52.8 median 16.4 Asus ZenFone 4 ZE554KL median 66.7 Delta 2.1 10 31.6 27 25.4 26.2 25.3 31.1 32.9 30.5 33.6 27.7 31.6 26.9 28.4 25.3 27 25.5 20.8 30.4 22 40.1 21.3 47.7 20.8 49.7 21.2 56.9 19.4 60.9 19.5 64.2 17.7 67.5 17.9 72.3 17.8 76.3 17.3 76.9 17.4 77.1 16.7 74.1 17.2 72.7 18.2 74.9 17.9 72.6 17.6 74.3 17.7 73.5 17.8 74.5 17.9 78.8 18.1 77.8 18.2 70.4 30 86.8 1.3 68.2 median 17.9 Lenovo Moto Z2 Play median 72.6 1.3 9.5 31.6 34.9 25.4 36.2 25.3 31.1 32.9 28.5 33.6 33.4 31.6 31.1 28.4 23.8 27 24.8 20.8 29.6 22 34.6 21.3 42.2 20.8 47.6 21.2 51.9 19.4 56 19.5 57.9 17.7 59.7 17.9 62.5 17.8 64.8 17.3 66.1 17.4 67.5 16.7 74 17.2 74.2 18.2 71.1 17.9 77.9 17.6 81.4 17.7 78.3 17.8 75.3 17.9 73 18.1 70.5 18.2 63.7 30 86.1 1.3 60 median 17.9 BQ Aquaris X Pro median 64.8 1.3 12 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

The Asus ZenFone 4’s power consumption is on a fairly high level, with the bright display drawing quite a bit of power, making the BQ Aquaris X Pro and Moto Z2 Play outlast it.. Our test device does not support wireless charging, but has QuickCharge 3.0 in return – so the specification sheet says. With the meager 10 watts of the included charger, a complete charge of the 3300 mAh takes more than 2 hours. A more powerful charger should cut down the measured time for a full charge..

The Asus ZenFone 4’s battery life is impressive among the competition and is outbid only by the Motorola Moto Z2 Play.. The results were most easily compared at an adjusted screen brightness of 150 cd/m². At this level, the ZenFone 4 performed merely averagely, its comparatively large battery notwithstanding. In our WLAN test it made fifth place and in video playback it made third.. On that account, the test device offers an encompassing battery saving mode, which can be individually adjusted to the user’s needs. During our tests we also noted that the smartphone uses very little power in standby mode and only marginally discharges across the day.. Idle (without WLAN, min brightness) 27h.

Test unit provided by Asus Germany.. Asus manages to offer an attractive continuation of its ZenFone series with the ZenFone 4. Its design is elegant, yet simple and its system performance convinced us. Its networking speeds are impressive, with LTE Cat 13 and good WLAN performance. Along with the new Snapdragon CPU, Bluetooth has been updated to its latest iteration and geolocation works very well. The updated GPU catapults the ZenFone 4 forward within its class and its display is well suited to outdoor use. With the ZenFone 4, Asus offers a competitively equipped smartphone that revealed almost no flaws in our test findings.. Generally, the ZenFone 4 leaves little room for valid criticism. Unfortunately, its USB port conforms to USB 2.0 standard and the included charger’s power is too low to utilize the fast charging technology marketed for the smartphone. Our impression of the dual-lens camera was ambivalent: While the main camera is excellent, the secondary lens cannot compare and is reminiscent of the LG G5’s flaws. The camera can produce excellent photos without doubt, but its second lens might remain unused.. The ZenFone 4 also caters to music aficionados with features like high-resolution audio, DTS and aptX HD, not to mention the integrated headphone jack. At €500 (~$593), its pricing seems a bit steep but we strongly recommend the ZenFone 4 nevertheless.. Asus ZenFone 4 ZE554KL - 2017-12-01 12/01/2017 v6 Daniel Schmidt.

News on all models including: Pro, Max and more!. Asus Zenfone 4 (ZE554KL) Review – Full Details. A certainty is a 5.5-inch model. The Zenfone 3 came in a 5.5-inch and 5.2-inch, but so far it doesn’t seem that Asus is releasing a base Zenfone 4 model in 5.2-inches. That said, there is a Verizon 5.2-inch model but it’s unclear is if that’s a Zenfone 4 or Zenfone 4 Max which is coming to be in a 5.2-inch size. Processor is going to be more battery saving than power. The Snapdragon 630 is going to power through tasks, make no mistake about it. Resolution is likely to be 1920 x 1080. The mainstream, mid range priced Zenfone 4 model is the ZE554KL. The phone is built for the best balance between price and performance.. Shop Now For A Zenfone 4:.

With the fourth generation of the ZenFone series, Asus challenges a fiercely contested submarket by not only offering competitive pricing but also by providing their latest offering with a strong camera. Moreover, ZenUI has taken a great leap forward, making it seem positively grown up!. 90% Asus Zenfone 4 â Review Source: Cool Smartphone Overall, I really top handset. Iâm only sorry that itâs not available on the big networks here in the UK, so youâll need to go through Amazon or Tesco for Â£449.99 or perhaps on a plan via Carphone Warehouse. It is a fantastic handset and priced well considering the quality and speed of it.

It doesnât really do anything special, but if you want a solid mid-range phone that doesnât have any serious weaknesses, the ASUS ZenFone 4 will likely appeal.

The ZenFone 4, in particular, is a solid option in its price point, so weâre pretty confident in saying that thereâs never been a better time to try out a Zenfone â especially if itâs the Zenfone 4.

ASUS ZenFone 4 review: A good phone let down by the price Source: Android Central And that's where I feel it comes to a sad conclusion. The ZenFone 4 is an excellent phone, but it's one that many may pass over because of its price. If the ASUS thing takes your fancy, the entry-level ZenFone 4 Max with an enormous battery is Â£200 less. But at Â£449, you're paying a fairly high price for a mid-range device. Ultimately, that's where it comes unstuck. Single Review, online available, Medium, Date: 11/30/2017. ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) review - A good beautiful mid-range smartphone Source: Tech Nave Overall, the ZenFone 4 is still a pretty good phone. My favourite features have to be the beautifully compact design, excellent battery performance and the camera is quite good too and it handles games quite well. The 8MP wide-angle is still okay in certain situations, but seriously, they really need to fix the connectivity performance. You may also find that your ZenFone 4 lags at times, so always be sure to check if there are any software updates because during my three weeks review, I've updated it three times already and I'm sure they will continue to roll out more. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 11/30/2017. Revisiting the ASUS ZenFone 4: A Formidable Premium Mid-Range Phone? Source: Unbox Hereâs the thing â the ASUS Zenfone 4 is underrated. People donât get to see how good it really is because theyâre immediately turned off by the price. Other flagship devices are just a few thousand pesos more so itâs hard to not consider other options. The hard reality is that the ZenFone 4 faces a tough competition at its current price point. Single Review, online available, Short, Date: 11/26/2017. 80% Asus ZenFone 4 review Source: Stuff TV Probably doesn't signal the start of an Asus assault on our phone-buying habits, but the ZenFone 4 is perfectly potent - if a little too stuck in its ways when it comes to software. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 11/08/2017 Rating: Total score : 80%. ASUS Zenfone 4 (SD630) Review Source: Yugatech All-in-all, the Zenfone 4 (SD630) is pretty much similar to its more powerful twin â same attractive and premium build, Super IPS display, and good camera quality. The only difference is the slight decrease in performance. Still, this device is capable of handling multiple tasks and a worthy addition to the Zenfone 4 lineup.

It has a battery capacity of 3300mAh, which can last you a full day.. Asus Zenfone 4 ZE554KL - Mint Green. Dual Cameras — 5x Light Sensitivity & 120° Wide View ZenFone 4 is a 5.5-inch smartphone that evolves the ZenFone lineage with luxurious, crafted design and delivers an unparalleled mobile photography experience with a dual-lens camera system featuring the flagship Sony IMX362 image sensor, a large F1.8 aperture lens and a 120° wide-angle lens. The latest powerful and energy-efficient Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 660/630 Mobile Platform provides performance for every scenario and a high-capacity 3300mAh lithium polymer battery coupled with ASUS BoostMaster fast-charging technology keeps ZenFone 4 going longer.. See a bigger and brighter world ZenFone 4 features an advanced dual-camera system that expands your creative options to take your mobile photography to new heights. Its 12MP main camera is equipped with the industry-leading Sony IMX362 image sensor with large 1.4µm pixels and a wide, F1.8 aperture lens to capture up to 5x brighter and clearer photos in low light. Its 120° wide-angle camera provides a 200% larger view than standard traditional smartphone cameras, letting you fit more scenery and people in the frame for dramatic landscape shots, better group photos, and a more convenient photography experience in confined indoor spaces. With instant switching between cameras, you can quickly achieve the perfect composition for your photo without missing the moment you want to capture. Camera performance is further improved by the Qualcomm Spectra™ 160 image signal processor (ISP), which ensures faster, smoother focusing and zooming, as well as photos with better color accuracy.. Fit more scenery and friends in the shot The 120° wide-angle camera on ZenFone 4 has a 200%* larger field of view than standard smartphone cameras, so you can fit more scenery and people in the frame for dramatic photos and videos that capture a true sense of place. When taking photos indoors, the wide-angle view makes it much easier to get the shot you want — especially in confined spaces where it may not be possible to take a few steps back to fit everyone and everything into the photo. The unique perspective of the wide-angle lens can also be used to stylistic effect, allowing you to exaggerate the sense of space in any setting to capture more dramatic scenes and stunning, expansive landscapes. * Calculation based on a standard lens with an 83° (25mm) field of view and a wide-angle lens with a 120° (12mm) field of view.. 5x brighter and clearer photos in low light To capture real-world authenticity, ZenFone 4 packs a 12MP main camera with a wide F1.8 aperture, plus the latest Sony® IMX362 sensor with a large 1.4µm pixel size. Combined with optical image stabilization (OIS) that allows blur-free handheld exposures of up to 1/4 seconds — 3x longer than cameras without OIS — and a six-element lens, 5x* more light can reach the camera sensor, making ZenFone 4 perfect for capturing brighter, clearer true-to-life photos at night, in low-light environments, and in back-lit situations. * Compared to typical smartphone with 16MP resolution, F1.7 aperture & 1.12µm pixel size.. Capture reality, fast and steady A dual pixel camera unit with 24 million focus detection sensors — two for each of its pixels — provides ultrafast 0.03 seconds phase-detection and subject-tracking auto-focus to ensure sharp and clear photos. Together with both optical and electronic image stabilization for blur-free photos and videos, a color correction sensor for true-to-life colors, and true 4K UHD video recording, the camera on ZenFone 4 goes above and beyond other smartphones.. Shoot like a pro, capture the fun The optional Pro mode offers manual camera controls similar to those found on DSLRs to give you complete creative control over your photography. With one-touch adjustments to shutter speed, white balance, exposure and ISO, as well as the ability to make your subjects stand out with Portrait mode and shoot in RAW format, ZenFone 4’s extensive camera controls let you capture stunning images that truly express your photographic vision. In addition to its advanced, manual controls, ZenFone 4’s camera has an assortment of fun, creative modes to enhance your photography experience and let you easily achieve professional-looking results..

Efficiently powerful, effortlessly fast ZenFone 4 combines incredible performance, optimized power efficiency, and advanced connectivity with security and convenience features to deliver a mobile experience like no other.

ZenFone 4 supports Category 12/13 4G LTE Advanced technology and 802.11ac dual-band Wi-Fi with MIMO for blazingly fast network connectivity in any situation. Built-in NFC enables convenient mobile payments with Android Pay, and a front-mounted fingerprint reader offers improved security and faster phone unlocking.. Charge faster, work and play longer When creating ZenFone 4, ASUS engineers combined the fantastic energy-efficiency of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 and Snapdragon 630 Mobile Platforms with a high-capacity 3300mAh lithium polymer battery, resulting in a smartphone that delivers up to 23 days of 4G standby time. When it’s time to recharge, ASUS BoostMaster technology provides 15W of power for incredibly fast charging. With ZenFone 4’s supplied adapter, just a five-minute charge provides two hours of talk time or achieves a 50% charge in just 36 minutes and built-in safeguards protect against overcharging.. Evolved beauty and tactility ZenFone 4 evolves the prestigious ZenFone design lineage with numerous refinements that give it a singular beauty and provide an unparalleled user experience. Crafted with a solid aluminum unibody using advanced Nano Molding Technology (NMT), ZenFone 4 is thin and light, yet incredibly strong.

ZenFone 4’s dual camera system is integrated completely within the phone chassis for a perfectly flat rear surface with no protrusions. Both the front and rear of the ZenFone 4 are encased in 2.5D curved Corning® Gorilla® Glass that provides a more comfortable grip and a durable, scratch-resistant finish. A fine, diamond-cut metal edge provides a luxurious accent and micro-etched, concentric-circle detailing that catches the light to make ZenFone 4 shimmer with a rich luster.. Bright and smart-adaptive display With a bright 600-nit Super IPS+ display, ZenFone 4 makes photos, videos, and all your other content look as vibrant as real life, even when viewed outdoors in bright sunlight. ASUS Splendid technology lets users adjust the color temperature of the display based on environmental lighting for the most comfortable viewing experience..

To be seen and not heard? Not this one. Oh ZenUI look how have you grown!. See more than others can see. Before we talk about the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL), let’s take a walk through the history of ZenFones.. ASUS has come a long way with their smartphones. While they have made quite a few attempts at designing smartphones like the unique PadFone series,. it was in 2014 when they launched their first ASUS ZenFone series. The first generation comprised of the ZenFone 4, ZenFone 5 and ZenFone 6. Yes, whoever the genius in charge of naming the smartphones back then in ASUS, they have not thought about the probability that they might want to make more phones. Anyway, they were well-positioned in the entry level with excellent value for money thanks to the nippy (but power hungry) Intel SoCs in them.. In 2015 the second generation of ASUS ZenFones arrived. The charge was led by the aptly named ASUS ZenFone 2 , and while ASUS made the step up to the mid-range with significant upgrades across the board, they still offered an excellent performance-per-ringgit ratio with their newer Intel Atom SoCs. Battery life was slightly better, but still worse than its contemporaries using Snapdragon’s SoC designs. The ZenFone Selfie , ZenFone Laser and ZenFone Max families also started in this generation. I would say the ASUS ZenFone 2 was when ASUS started getting more serious with their ZenFone lineup, even coming up with the really impressive ASUS ZenFone Zoom with 10X optical zoom , a feat that few smartphones manufacturers can match even today.. 2016 was the year ASUS decided to ditch Intel’s powerful but inefficient SoCs and use Qualcomm Snapdragon SoCs in their smartphones. The ASUS ZenFone 3 series arrived with new Snapdragon SoCs inside, vastly improved cameras with laser focusing systems across the board and price tags that were quite a bit higher than those that came before them. The initial trio consisted of the. ASUS ZenFone 3 , ASUS ZenFone 3 Ultra. These three were then followed up by the ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser , ZenFone 3 Max 5.2″ (ZC520TL) and Max 5.5″ (ZC553KL). The second generation Zoom came in the form of the ZenFone 3 Zoom , but ASUS dropped the optical zoom lens module in favor of a dual camera system. ASUS ZenFone AR was the closing chapter in the ASUS ZenFone 3 story, and it ended on a very high note.. Enough reminiscing about the past though. We have the latest line-up of ASUS ZenFone 4 walking into our labs. Yes, ridiculous naming convention, I know. With dual cameras on nearly all members of the series, ASUS is definitely furthering their vision of packing their smartphones with great cameras. The ASUS ZenFone 4 Max Pro and ASUS ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro. came and went, and today I have the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL). With a heftier weight and also price tag, can it impress me? Get comfortable, as this is going to be one of our most in-depth reviews to date.. ASUS never disappoints when it comes to their packaging. The black and gold finishing on the box just screams premium. Opening up the box you aren’t greeted by the smartphone first, but by ASUS reminding you that We <3 Photo. Hell yeah we do! This decision also means that it lowers the risk of you dropping your brand new smartphone onto the sidewalk just because you unboxed it wrong .. The ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) comes with all the trappings you would expect to come with your new smartphone. You even get a case to protect that shining glass back. The charger is pretty disappointing, coming in at only 10W. Newsflash ASUS, people are packing 20W chargers with their smartphones last year , keep up.. The front is about as generic as it gets, looking like one of the many Chinese smartphones you can find on the market now. ASUS could have touched it up by adding concentric circle patterns on the vast top and bottom bezels. There is no ASUS emblem here. ASUS also moved the fingerprint sensor to the front. Perhaps ASUS received feedback that a fingerprint sensor on the front is more convenient, but I don’t agree with that. In any case, this is a solid state variant which feels more premium and should prove more resilient than the tactile kind found in the last generation devices.. The back still sports a concentric circle motif which focuses on from the ASUS logo, but the pattern isn’t nearly as apparent now with the gaps being finer than ever. I thought we had precise measurements for the gaps, ASUS? It still shimmers nicely though. If you want a really pretty back, I would recommend going for the Midnight Black variant though, as the white one here doesn’t really look as magnificent. The top left corner is where you will find the dual camera setup flush under the back glass with the RGB sensor and LED flash sharing the same perforation. The LED flash is isolated from the glass back too, to prevent light bleeding into the cameras. The smooth glass back allows the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) to slide around on a flat surface way too easily, so you might want to put on a case just so that it stays put.. You will find the power and volume buttons on the right and the SIM tray on the left. The buttons do not feature the concentric circle pattern anymore, which makes them look and feel cheaper than its predecessors. The band running around the sides are chamfered here too.. Moving up, the top is bare except for the lonely secondary microphone. The bottom edge is a lot busier, with the 3.5mm jack, USB Type-C port, primary microphone and loudspeaker here. Notice how I didn’t say “mono loudspeaker”? Well that’s because the earpiece also doubles as a loudspeaker in a configuration somewhat akin to HTC’s current implementation of BoomSound. The perforations for the loudspeaker are chamfered too, showing ASUS’ attention to detail.. ASUS knows how to play the number game very well. Their experience in the laptop industry is definitely showing here. ASUS did not skimp on the RAM and AC WiFi support like many manufacturers do. We have a few upgrades here and there over the previous generation. The Snapdragon 630 is an upgrade of the Snapdragon 625 which we really enjoyed thanks to its efficiency, so we are looking forward to some nice numbers in our benchmarks too. The bigger 3300 mAh battery here also bodes well for battery life, especially when coupled with the efficient SoC. 64GB eMCP is actually just eMMC packaged together with RAM to save space, so no blazing fast UFS storage here. The secondary 8MP camera might seem like someone is doing a #throwback here, but that’s really not the case. We will discuss more about each specification in the respective sections. Meanwhile ASUS still forgot to put NFC into the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL), meaning no easy one-tap pairing or Android Pay.. The Snapdragon 630 builds upon the Snapdragon 625 by clocking the cores differently. While the Snapdragon 625 had all eight of the cores running at up to 2.0 GHz, the Snapdragon 630 runs four at up to 2.2 GHz, while the remainder tops out at 1.8 GHz. This configuration should mean the Snapdragon 630 is capable of better single-core performance, while not sacrificing efficiency nor performance when handling multi-threaded tasks. The Adreno 508 adds 200 MHz to the Adreno 506, resulting in a claimed 30% performance increase. The 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM is just the cherry on top of all the performance niceties the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) is packing. Will the differences be tangible? Time to run some benchmarks.. The ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) performs well in Antutu, placing quite comfortably above the Snapdragon 625 devices. This device is about 5% faster than the fastest Snapdragon 625 device we have previously tested, which is quite a comfortable lead. ASUS’ choice to go with the Snapdragon 630 may be motivated by efficiency concerns, but it definitely doesn’t lack in terms of performance.. The trend is also visible in Geekbench which tests the CPU performance. As expected, we see a small single core performance gain, while multi-core performance remains largely unaffected when compared against the Snapdragon 625 devices. For some reason, the ASUS ZenFone 3 outperforms the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) by a large margin. The benchmark for the ASUS ZenFone 3 was run a long time ago, so Geekbench may have been tweaked some time between then and now.. The GPU performance of the ASUS ZenFone 4 is a clear upgrade over the Snapdragon 625-packing devices. It seems that Qualcomm was being conservative about their claims and the Adreno 508 actually offers 177% of the performance of the fastest Adreno 506 device we have on this chart in Sling Shot Extreme (ES 3.1)! Gains are more modest on older APIs, but the performance gains are definitely worth the 200 MHz overclock done on the GPU.. PCMark evaluates the performance in work-related tasks. The ASUS ZenFone 4 is performs well here, and it ranking just below the Galaxy S8 with the Exynos 8895 is definitely nice to see. It is still a far cry from the ASUS ZenFone 3 which has scored above 6000 points in this benchmark. Then again, no Snapdragon 625 has ever come close to the ASUS ZenFone 3’s score.. Battery life of the ASUS ZenFone 4 is great. It is not a battery beast like the ASUS ZenFone 4 Max Pro and ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom , but it does pretty well here. We see the ASUS ZenFone 4 clocking in at 10 hours 19 minutes, handily beating the Ufeel Go and Ufeel Fab which pack huge batteries but less efficient chipsets.. Real world usage also reflects the efficiency of the Snapdragon 630 in the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL). 3 hours out of the 5 hours 48 minutes of SOT was spent in Arena of Valor. If you aren’t into gaming, the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) can go even longer without a recharge. Which is good, as the 10W charger takes quite a while to rejuice the 3300 mAh battery here.. The 5.5″ display is carried over from the ZenFone 3 and it really seems like there wasn’t much improvements done in this area. You get a similar insanely bright 600 nit maximum brightness that can melt your retinas and a 1080p resolution which is really all you need at this size. 401 pixels-per-inch is plenty sharp and I doubt anyone can really pick on the pixels. The standard screen size also makes the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) easy to hold. A 6″ 18:9 display would have fit very well in this body too, but I guess ASUS isn’t interested in 18:9 just yet. As a result, the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) here features a 72% screen-to-body ratio, which is actually a regression from yesteryear’s 77.3%.. It’s not entirely unexpected that when you move the fingerprint sensor to the front, you give up some screen-to-body ratio. Luckily, the fingerprint sensor won’t be something you complain about. It’s fast and accurate, and can still detect my fingerprint even if they were slightly wet. In fact this is probably the fastest fingerprint sensor I have ever used. The surface is also made of glass, thus being way more resistant to scratches than the plastic ASUS used in the previous generation. And oh, these capacitive buttons are backlit.. Yup, the earpiece can blast tunes too. ASUS goes with a dual-speaker configuration this time, which is pretty interesting. We have seen them dabble with stereo speakers but place them ridiculously in the ASUS ZenFone 3 Ultra , and this time ASUS is using the earpiece as a secondary speaker for a better soundstage. The result is pretty good, sounding much better than your average loudspeaker output. ASUS calls it stereo, but because the output of the earpiece is so much weaker than the loudspeaker, the stereo effect is not as great as expected. The earpiece has zero bass response, so it’s just delivering the treble to amp up the audio experience in tandem with the regular loudspeaker. Plugging in headphones makes it even better though, as the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) is actually Hi-Res Audio certified for. AudioWizard is back in full force, with a revamped UI and also headphone profiles. Previous iterations only featured profiles for ASUS’ in-house earphones, but this time they went all out. It seems like they imported user-made profiles from Viper4Android, but I am not sure if that is really the case. The profiles attempt to balance the sound signature of whatever headphones you are using. Coupled with DTS Headphone:X’s ability to bring surround sound to any stereo headphones, the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) is a real treat to use for media consumption. And if you are unsatisfied with all that, you can play around with the preset equalizers or just tune your own with the 10-band equalizer. Or just tweak the bass and treble sliders for a simpler time. While there wasn’t any mention of AptX support on its official website, the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) supports the high quality Bluetooth codec for better wireless audio.. Screenshots do not actually come out desaturated like this. Equally interesting is the ASUS Splendid app. ASUS has decided to hide Splendid and AudioWizard away from the app drawer, so you will have to take a journey into the display settings to find this. Instead of just the usual color profiles, ASUS has even added an auto-color temperature mode for a better viewing experience. The Balance mode isn’t exactly balanced, as it does tend to look vivid. Considering that Super AMOLED displays are fan favorites when it comes to color accuracy, this is a great move from ASUS. Vivid takes it a notch further, and if that doesn’t please you, you can customize the hue and saturation of your display yourself. You can even go have a #throwback into the old days when we didn’t have color displays by turning down the saturation completely.. Aside from the above two highlights, ASUS has touched up most of their UI with ZenUI 4.0. Gone are the gaudy colorful quick setting icons, with flat icons taking their place. The entire settings menu also looks cleaner with the new flat icons. The launcher has also matured with some features taken from third party launchers. You have the ability to change fonts, icon packs and even make your own theme if you so wish. The only grouse I have is that I can’t swipe up to get to the app drawer, as the gesture is used for opening the launcher menu. Maybe that might change with Android 8.0 Oreo, which is supposed to come pretty soon to all the ZenFone 3 and ZenFone 4 devices .. ASUS has been getting a lot of flak due to their tendency to load previous ZenFones with bloatware, but their latest devices should allow them to get rid of that infamy soon enough. They have been steadily paring back the amount of bloatware that comes with their devices, and the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) has none of that crap. ASUS’ own apps like Mobile Manager, Selfie Master as well as the full G Suite do make an appearance, but I am not even complaining as these are actually legit useful apps. ASUS even went to the extent of using Google’s Messages and Play Music to replace their own version of the apps. I would say ASUS has really matured on the software front with the latest ZenUI 4.0, with a very fluid experience thanks to the huge amount of RAM and nippy processor. While the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) may not top benchmark charts, it does everything with sufficient gusto to make me nearly forget that this is a mid-range SoC under the hood. The quick animations also makes the whole experience feel snappier, unlike the Galaxy J7+ and its slow animations that stuttered under heavier loads.. Some of ASUS’ additions include OptiFlex, a feature which allows you to add apps to the list for faster loading times. I didn’t notice a tangible difference in loading times for AOV though. Game Genie allows you to to lock the navigation keys to prevent accidentally being kicked out to the home screen, stream your games on YouTube and Twitch, and even record gestures as macros. Twin Apps allows you to do what it says, have two Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Whatsapp on a single device. Instagram actually supports multiple accounts natively now though. Page Marker allows you save webpages to read later, which is nifty if you want to read something later without having to spend your quota reloading it.. Last but not least is ZenUI Safeguard, an app that allows you to send SOS messages and your current location to your selected contacts. It’s discreetly triggered by tapping the power button three times, so you can easily do it in an emergency. Report Location is also a great feature so your contacts can track your location in real time. A great addition especially in a world where bad things happen to good people.. The Gallery app has also been updated with facial recognition. All the better to sort the images you capture with the impressive dual camera! It can detect similar faces to group them together, or center the images around the faces in thumbnails. It’s cool to see that facial recognition is becoming mainstream even without the need for a specific neural processing unit in the SoC.. Another area ASUS has been making progress in is the camera department. While the ZenFone 3 series packed amazing cameras, only the ZenFone 3 Zoom came with dual cameras. This year, ASUS has dual cameras on nearly all the devices in the ZenFone 4 family. The ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) is no different, with a standard 12MP f/1.8 camera paired with a wide angle 8MP f/2.2 camera. 8MP might seem outdated, but to pair a wide angle lens with a larger sensor would mean that the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) will have to have a camera hump. ASUS isn’t having any of that, so decides to sacrifice resolution for a flat back. The RGB sensor also makes a comeback here, but there is no laser focusing to speak of now.. Like the rest of the software, the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL)’s camera UI has also been revamped. There has been a paring back of features while the Pro mode is a lot more intuitive with the settings moving in an ergonomic arc around the shutter button. If you want a guide on how to play around with the manual parameters, do check out the guide here. However the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL)’s camera is optimized enough to mean that the Pro mode will largely go unused. The placement of the RAW mode is not as intuitive though, hidden in the resolution sub-menu for some reason. HDR Pro mode is also gone, and you only get the instant HDR mode. I didn’t really like the exaggerated look of HDR Pro images anyway, so I am fine with it. ASUS has also dropped their low light oversampling technology from the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL), trusting the large 1.4 μm pixels and wide f/1.8 aperture to do their job in poorer lighting. The wide aperture on the standard camera allows for some bokehlicious close ups without any software processing. If you want more blurring, there is the Portrait Mode but it only works when it detects a face in the frame. Aside from a new UI, the camera software has also been tweaked. Images come out looking good with strong contrast and vivid colors. The auto mode also more than sufficed for great shots now, with me only having to play with the EV every once in a while. This is in contrast to the ZenFone 3 series which required a little more skill to extract better images out of the capable sensors. The new instant HDR means you won’t have to wait for your HDR images to appear, but the effect is really mild this time around. Consistent good results are what you can expect out of the cameras on the ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL). Check out the full-sized shots on Flickr .. The 8MP camera wide angle also takes amazing shots but you might need to tweak it a little due to the weaker high ISO performance and smaller aperture. It has a tendency to unnecessarily boost exposure, leading to more noise in your shot. Fine details are definitely lacking especially when compared with the 12MP primary camera. Nonetheless, I really appreciate that ASUS went with a wide angle camera here instead of a “telephoto” lens as the wide angle camera really gives you a different perspective. I am far from done exploring the possibilities, but with the image quality available, I am sure I will play around with the wide angle camera more. There is also support for 1080p60 and 4K30 video recording on the primary camera, while the wide angle camera only goes up to 1080p30.. The ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) may not deliver flagship-class performance with its Snapdragon 630 under the hood, but the user experience was definitely as fluid as one I would expect from a flagship device. You may miss fast charging, but the excellent battery life sort of makes up for it. The two great cameras are also fun to use, with the optimized software delivering good results in any lighting condition easily. ZenUI 4.0 marks a great step forward for ASUS’ UI too, with no crappy bloatware and a slew of useful features added. ASUS has made an amazing device here.. Pricing is another story altogether though. While ASUS has vastly improved upon the last generation, the competition hasn’t been idle either. ASUS’ succeeded in making a device that I enjoyed using, but whether I am willing to pay RM2099 for it is a different story. I will be docking points here as value for money is one of the main criterion evaluated before I will recommend it. The ASUS ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) is worthy of our Silver Pokdeward, failing to bag our highest honors not because it isn’t an excellent device. — which it is — but simply because it is priced slightly too ambitiously. If ASUS is listening, drop the price a little, and you may just have yourself a bestseller..
