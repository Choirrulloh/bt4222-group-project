Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Dual-camera (5-megapixel, 120-degree viewing angle, F2.2 aperture), Autofocus. Software Features: Digital image stabilization, Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Night mode, Effects. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Quad-core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 6.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 20.0 days (480 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz.

Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Alcatel 1x Alcatel 3 Alcatel 3x. Evan Blass has published the new press renders of three Alcatel smartphones, which should take place at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Specifically, let’s talk about Alcatel 1x, Alcatel 3 and Alcatel 3x, belonging to the 2018 lineup announced at CES in Las Vegas at the beginning of the year.. Actually, there are not many technical details so far emerged. For example, we know that it belongs to the budget segment, and the press images confirm the presence of a display within 18:9 format, a front camera, a rear camera and the LED flash. The material of the housing seems to be polycarbonate, especially when compared with the other two models published by Blass Alcatel 3 and 3x, equipped with a metal chassis.. If even the first of the two is currently shrouded in mystery (we can only describe the image that 18:9 format display, the front and rear cam, the LED flash and the rear fingerprint sensor) We have some details about Alcatel 3x emerged from the FCC and WiFi Alliance certifications, according to which the device would be equipped with the Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system, a MediaTek MT6739V processor with quad-core 1.5GHz ARM Cortex-A53 cores and a 3000mAh battery. Also, in this case, the display is in 18:9 format, while on the back a dual camera is positioned just above the fingerprint sensor.. If we are sure that Alcatel announces the 1x model in Barcelona (with Alcatel 5 and Alcatel 3v) as revealed by Alcatel USA a few days ago, we can’t say for the other Alcatel 3 and 3x devices, even if the press renders lead us to think that the presentation can take place at MWC 2018. We are awaiting confirmation after all the event will be held tomorrow.. Share Facebook Twitter Google + LinkedIn Pinterest. Tags Alcatel Alcatel 1X Alcatel 3 Alcatel 3X Android Mobiles MWC MWC 2018.

Leaked press renders in late 2017 revealed upcoming Alcatel phones including the Alcatel 3V, Alcatel 3C, Alcatel 1X, and Alcatel 3X, and during the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Alcatel took the wraps off the Alcatel 1, Alcatel 3, and Alcatel 5 series. Since then, new information about the phones has been hard to come by — of all the rumored Alcatel devices so far, only. But thanks to a combination of materials from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Wi-Fi Alliance, we’ve been able to glean a bit about the hardware and software of the upcoming Alcatel 3X .. According to the FCC documents, the Alcatel 3X will come equipped with a 3,000mAh battery. Meanwhile, the Wi-Fi Alliance lists the phone’s operating system as “Android 7.1.1 Nougat”.. Moving on to the FCC’s disassembly photos, we see that the Alcatel 3X has MediaTek’s MT6739V system-on-chip inside it. The MediaTek MT6739V SoC, which was. launched in India back in September of last year , has four. ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores that can clock up to 1.5GHz.. Digging through documents attached to the FCC filing reveals scans of the Alcatel 3X’s user manual, which includes screenshots of the phone’s app and software UIs.. Finally, a few images from the FCC show the phone from all angles.. Until now, we’d only seen a leaked press render of the Alcatel 3X, which showed a metal chassis, a dual-camera setup on the back, and slim bezels. The FCC’s photos appear to confirm all of it.. From close-up images and photos from all angles to the screenshots of the UI, there’s no question that. we have a much better picture of the Alcatel 3X than before. Here’s hoping we learn more ahead of Mobile World Congress 2017, where Alcatel’s 2018 lineup is expected to be announced in full.. Want more posts like this delivered to your inbox?
