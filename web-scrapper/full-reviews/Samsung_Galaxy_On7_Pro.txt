I got it for Rs.7500 on Samsung estore. more First of all On7 Pro is a decent device. I got it around 1 and half year now. Never faced any heating and freezing/hanging issue. I bought it at around 10000/- to replace the the old Lumia 540. I choose it because Snapdragon 410 is good enough to handle day to day tasks. It runs every app I need to manage my life. Second good feature is the proper 3 slots and removable battery. As for screen it is good for the price , but comparing it to IPS or new display is unfair. I watched a lot of HD videos on it which is good experience. As for UI, if you don't like it the default launcher, than try third party launchers like Nova, Microsoft etc. I use Google Now which is basic but productive. And last but not least, it will get Nouget in few days. Initially I was not expecting it, but I am happy to see that Samsung has not forgetton this model. Anyway if you use this device for few days; you will start to like it. At 7500/- you get a good value for money.

Mobiles / Samsung Mobile Phones / Samsung Galaxy On7 Pro 2017 Price in India. User Visits: 970 Compare. Samsung Galaxy On7 Pro 2017 Description. The South Korean handset maker, Samsung has managed to successfully tap the Indian handset market with the array of series launched. It launched the On series of handsets to offer well-built handsets in budget segment. The latest launch in this series comes in the form of 2017 variant of Galaxy On7 Pro. Here is a lowdown of all the pros and cons of the handset for those who are looking for it.. The handset comes with a 13MP sensor on the rear panel, which, accompanied by an LED flash is capable of taking some impressive images. However, it is the one on the front that takes the cake in case of this device. The same 13MP camera makes an appearance on the front panel accompanied with an LED flash and makes for good low light selfies.. The handset comes with a massive 5.7-inch display on the front, which makes it a good option for multimedia lovers. Moreover, the display has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which is ideal for watching high resolution videos or playing games. For those who prefer to catch up on their favourite shows or movies using their phones, this smartphone is a pretty good option.. That Samsung was once known as a brand that used outdated Android and bogged it down with its own resource-hungry Touchwiz UI, is a common knowledge. However, the brand has really made progress in terms of software and its recent smartphones are testament to that. The Galaxy On7 Pro 2017 flaunts Android Nougat based Experience UI, which is the revamped interface with minimal bloatware from the brand. As a result, the user experience on the handset is pretty smooth and pleasant.. While the massive display on the front panel is definitely a boon for many, it also turns out to be bane for others. This is because the big display of the device results in the bulk of the handset as well. Not being able to use the handset one-handed is certainly a deal breaker for many users and Galaxy On7 Pro 2017 definitely requires two hands to operate.. The South Korean handset maker has been launching some really impressive smartphones in the market recently. The Galaxy On7 Pro carries the baton forward successfully. However, it might not sit well with those who are not much into bulky phones.. 12,990 (Expected Price) Samsung Galaxy On7 Pro 2017 is currently not available in any online store..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 1.0 out of 5 stars Bad product. Bought this phone in September 2017. Got heating problem in the first week itself. She uses it only for basic functions apart from Whatsapp. Even when it showed charging of 84% in the morning, the battery drained out to 3% by 6p.m. This when she didn't use it at all from 8 a.m to 2 p.m. The phone heats up so much that it becomes uncomfortable to take calls without an ear phone. Trying to sell it off at loss. SAMSUNG IS GOING THE NOKIA WAY and that too at a FASTER PACE. If any Samsung employee reads this, i suggest they better change company before they are laid off for losses made due to bad products.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Nice at it's place. Okay,writting this review after 3 months of usage. Don't read that negative reviews which are written by some of the morons. If you think that mi phones are better than samsung's phones and less costly,ya they are good but they are not 'samsung'! Samsung is the brand from years,trusted by millions of indians. Service centers are available in your cities and towns,if compared to mi....there are only few service centers available in india,that means if anything goes wrong with your phone you can rush it to nearby centers rather than packing it and send it to mi by couriers. Ok let's come to the point. Bought this phone on diwali offer at 7590/-. overall look is great,premium golden colour and sleek design(slimmer than than mi note 4). Camera quality is also good with 13mp rear and 5mp front camera,no mi phones can even come close to it's picture quality(you can watch it's camera comparisions in youtube) Screen is good but not great since its 'TFT' dislpay,but it doesn't matter. 5.5 inch desplay makes gaming and movie watching experiance more efficient. If we talk about the battery backup,it will run about 7-8 hours on 4G for heavy users like me(on continuos gaming,movies,social media, etc.). If you are a normal user,it will run about 18-24 hours. If you think this phone will lag on continous usage........sorry you are wrong it won't lag at all. I have played games like 'real racing 3D'(in-app size 1GB+), 'wwe 2K'(500mb+), 'shadow fight 3'(400mb+) and many others high performance games with 'No Lag Issue'. Speed on jio 4G is good(5-10mbps on my area) It could be more better at your places if there is a good coverage and towers availibility. Bit heating issue on continuos internet usage but that's normal(nothing to worry). Ui is as better as it always was on samsung phones. Lack of some censors but there are still some neccesory censors that is needed to run your device smoothly. Still good to buy at the price of 8990/- but you can wait for price-drop. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars Waste of fine. Phone has to be with you to hear the ring sound. Tried to return but by the time we noticed it was late. Update:Trusting Samsung I bought this device, but this is just a trash, the phone hangs all the time, devices crashes, doesn't reboot, always call goes on ghost hold and call ends abruptly. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome speed with zero lag and there is not a .... Awesome speed with zero lag and there is not a single hanging issue. RAM managment is much pretty , most of the time available RAM was 1Gb. 3.Samasung made processor has awesome potential , it played all the HD and FULL HD videos in MX player. I played temple run and subway surfer , i didnt notice any lags. Battery life is amazing as this processor focus on smart battery usage. Better service than most of available mobile companies Cons 1.

Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars front camera is not that great.. battery generally lasts for 20hrs on moderate .... Having used for a year now.. the product has well served its purpose.. front camera is not that great.. battery generally lasts for 20hrs on moderate to heavy 4g usage.. but drains very fast from 15 to 0%.. samsung should look into this..sound is okay.. 4g speeds on both the slots works well. processing becomes slow if u hv too many apps on the phone.. overall my rating is 4/5 aftr 1 yr of usage!. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing phone in such a low price..no heating issue..u can buy it. No problem since i bought it.... Screen size is perfect, no heating issue..battery is somewhat doesnt work for a long if u surfing internet continuously..may it lasts for 3 hrs..if u dont use internet and only calling purpose and bit internet usage then it may work for a day..not bad..lookwise its amazing..internal memory is also good 16gb, if u dont use lots of apps then it serves ur purpose...

Missing Gyroscope and Ambient light sensors No HDR mode Slippery design. Samsung Galaxy On 7 Pro review. The Samsung Galaxy On 7 Pro is average at best, and does little to differentiate itself from the competition. There are far better options in the form of the Moto G4 or the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. The build quality of the device is also nothing to write home about. The plastic construction doesn't inspire much confidence and feels rather cheap. The back is removable and is very smooth and slippery. As with every Samsung budget smartphone, the quality of the removable back panel is extremely poor.. Great battery life Above average and snappy rear camera Decent Screen S Bike mode can be useful for some. Uninspired and boring design Questionable build quality Lacks basics like the ambient light sensor Mediocre performance Poor front camera. For moderate user this is perfect. Big screen 5.5inch ,good front camera,good battery 3000mah,4g LTE. Very average rear camera , ambient sensor missing. Under the budget of 8000, this is the best phone. Such a big screen it has. I became a fan of this phone. I recommend this phone to all those whose budget is 8000 .. Camera works good on night and pics are clear. Preinstalled apps cover a very little part of storage. In my point of view it has no negative point.. I am using this mbl for last 11 months..at that time it was around 11k actually it's good mbl looking at its all features..ram is sufficient i m playing games like future fight and many high graphics games bt it never hangs so no issue for processor camera is decent over all experience are awesome. Camera Ram Look Samsung service is easily available Removable battery. Battery issue it takes 3 to 4 hours to charge and I m personally facing charging issues like it's 3000 mah bt feels like 2000 mah it really drains quickly so I will not recommend this mbl look for other brands. The phone has a good features in this price. If you need a brand then go for it. If you want to buy china there are many phones avilable. This phone is good for less users.. 4g Good look To use this phone smoothly buy 32gb ultra memory then it runs smooth very freely. Wifi is good Battery is awsome for less users. Bettery takes 3hrs to charge Front light sensor missing Ram should be 3gb. i am using this phone front camera is ok Voice quality is too good Net surfing is OK Design is ok Speaker have good quality slim phone. Battery is poor Rear camera qulaity is not good as per pixel qulaity. Enter each Pro in new line.. Enter each Con in new line.. Who Viewed This Also Viewed ....

Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro, Galaxy On7 Pro launched in India, priced at Rs 9,190 and Rs 11,190: Specifications, features. Samsung has launched upgraded variants of last year's Galaxy On5, Galaxy On7. Published: July 12, 2016 9:59 AM IST. Samsung launched the Galaxy On5 and Galaxy On7 smartphones in India towards the end of last year, priced at Rs 8,990 and Rs 10,990. The company has today quietly launched the successors of these smartphones in India. The Galaxy On5 Pro and Galaxy On7 Pro are both listed on Amazon India, with a price tag of Rs 9,190 and Rs 11,190 respectively. Buyers will also be entitled to a bunch of launch day offers.. Samsung has retained all the design elements, including the faux leather back panel. As far as improvements are concerned, the Galaxy On5 Pro and Galaxy On7 Pro both get more RAM under the hood, and double the amount of internal storage. The rest of the specifications though remain the same. On the software front, the new smartphones run on Android Marshmallow 6.0, and are also bundled with features like Ultra Data Saving mode and the S bike mode, which was introduced with the Galaxy J3 (2016) earlier this year. Despite the upgrades, Samsung’s new smartphones still seem under-equipped to take on the competition in their respective segments.. Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro specifications, features : The smartphone sports a 5-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) display, and is powered by a 1.3GHz Exynos 3475 quad-core processor paired with Mali-T720 GPU and 2GB of RAM. Also on offer is 16GB internal storage, which is expandable up to 128GB using a microSD card.. The Galaxy On5 Pro is also equipped with an 8-megapixel rear camera with LED flash, f/2.2 aperture, 5-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.2 aperture, and a 2,600mAh battery. Connectivity options include dual-SIM card slots, 4G support, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, and GPS.. Priced at Rs 9,190, the Galaxy On5 Pro will be up against the likes of the LeEco Le 1s, Micromax Canvas Pulse 4G, Gionee F103 and the Lenovo K3 Note to name a few.
