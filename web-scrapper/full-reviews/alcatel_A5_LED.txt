A quick glance at its specs would suggest that it would be the ideal. alternative to the Lenovo Moto G5. The Alcatel A5 LED has a disco on its back, making it the sort of phone you can picture in Calvin Harris’ pocket if he. were a Nissan Micra driver rather than someone behind the wheel of a McLaren.. and a camera that’s significantly worse than the competition make it a good buy only if you’re in love with the idea of being able to bring out a tiny light show at parties.. There’s one reason to buy the Alcatel A5 LED: the LED shell on its rear. It’s actually removable, but to call it a ‘case’ is a real disservice.. Twenty-five multi-colour LEDs produce a light show that turns the Alcatel A5 LED into a programmable mobile disco.. When you use the phone as normal, those LEDs are dormant, making the rear look like it has a slim and stylish case attached, thanks in the main to the camera sitting below this shell. A honeycomb-like pattern of light-grey dots form a. translucent plastic through which the LEDs shine.. I tend to like my phones fairly plain. The Honor 9 borders on brash, and every now and then I take out the first-gen Moto G to remind myself that a phone lacking any stand-out design features can actually look quite nice. Miserably monotone as my taste may be, I think Alcatel has done well with this device’s rear. The diffusion of the light, those large-but-soft LEDs are signs of a job well done, particularly in a budget phone.. You can customise what the lights do too, using an app called Light Show. The two best uses for the LED cover are for music and notifications.. There’s a handful of presets for music light performances – including ones that ‘emulate’ rain, fireworks and shooting stars – that react to the music played. The Rhythm preset, for example, makes the lights act like an EQ waveform, changing colour constantly too. On receiving a notification, the first letter of the app in question scrolls across the screen on a coloured background.. What’s the point, I hear you ask? If you’re coming to the Alcatel A5 LED looking for utility, you’re missing the point. The LEDs are there for fun.. The Light Show app does have a crack at adding more obvious uses, in the form of a virtual electronic musician-style sample pad that plays. instrument clips and corresponding LEDs on the back as you tap. However, it’s pretty poor, and has clearly been made for a means to entertain young kids.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

It’s made of plastic, uses light-up soft keys (aside from the drawn-on central one) and, thanks to the case, is heavier than most devices at 170g. By comparison, the Moto G5 weighs 145g.. There’s also no sign here of any of the extra hardware features we’ve seen starting to drip down to cheaper phones. There’s no fingerprint scanner, and the Alcatel A5 LED has a micro-USB socket rather than new newer USB-C. 16GB storage and a microSD slot keep it up with the rest in other respects, though.. The Alcatel A5 LED has a 5-inch 720p IPS LCD screen. It isn’t as sharp as the Moto G5’s display, but this isn’t something that presented as an issue as I continued using the handset.. Colour is rather good for a budget phone and, unlike some models, the image appears right on the surface of the display. Low-rent LCDs can look recessed, which happens when the layers of a screen aren’t sandwiched together tightly enough.. Those who like to play with the look of their phone’s screen will appreciated the MiraVision tool in the Alcatel A5 LED. This lets you alter the colour saturation, contrast and a few other elements. Both the ‘normal’ and ‘vivid’ modes look good as-is, but I did end up tweaking the colour temperature since the phone leans towards the blueish side as standard.. Like any good budget phone, the Alcatel A5 LED has an auto-brightness setting. Top brightness is fair rather than searing, and at certain angles there’s some colour/contrast shift, which signifies that this isn’t a top-drawer panel. Overall, however, the screen is fine..

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. LED gimmick is not enough for this below-par budget phone. Alcatel is still taking a gimmicky approach to the budget Android phone market, but a flashy LED array fails to mask a long list of distinctly disappointing compromises.. Alcatel A5 LED price and release date Starts at £169/AU$299 Cheaper as PAYG Not available in US yet LED Lightshow like a Lego disco dancefloor LED back lights up in time to music Light Show app offers various lighting routines Design and display Chunky plastic design 5.2-inch IPS LCD is only 720p No fingerprint sensor. The Alcatel A5 LED is a budget phone with a flashing LED back plate that’s designed to attract bargain seekers with a love of disco lighting.. So far, it’s available in Europe and Australia and will cost you £169/AU$299 (around $220). On paper, the Alcatel A5 LED is just about exactly what you’d expect for that kind of money.. The pricing means that it’s going head-to-head with the budget crowd, taking on phones like the Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus and our current budget pick, the Moto G5. It’s going to take more than some LEDs to beat that kind of stiff competition.. Chinese manufacturer TCL Communications, also maker of the BlackBerry KeyOne , has been churning out budget and mid-range phones under the Alcatel brand for years now, so you might expect them to be getting good at it.. Unfortunately, the A5 LED is a mixed bag with some serious problems. The cynical among you might discount the light show as a gimmicky distraction to the weaknesses of this phone. Let’s find out if you’re right to do so.. The official price of the Alcatel A5 LED in the UK is £169, but you can already get it a bit cheaper at Argos, where it’s currently listed at £140, or you can snap it up on pay-as-you-go at Vodafone or Giffgaff for just £99 and a £10 service bundle.. If you’re in Australia, you’ll need to pay AU$299 to get an unlocked Alcatel A5 LED.. The phone is set to be released in the US at some point, where we imagine it will cost somewhere around $220 based on the UK price, though we wouldn’t be surprised if it came in under the $200 mark.. If this was just the Alcatel A5, minus the LED back, then there would be little reason to consider it. But slap an array of colored lights on the back and it becomes the Alcatel A5 LED – the ideal phone for party people who’ve blown their budget on partying.. You’d be forgiven for thinking that the decision to slap an alternative LED back into the box came late on when the manufacturer realized how truly boring this phone is, because when you first unpackage it, there’s a slim, black plastic back on there with a subtle brushed metal pattern.. Dig deeper and you’ll find the chunky LED back plate. Snap it into place, fire up the special Light Show app, and feel your cynicism wash away as it bathes you in a rainbow of glorious flashing glare and dazzle. Put it face down and it looks just like a disco dance floor for Lego people.. There’s a surprising array of options in the comprehensive Light Show app. You can have the LEDs light up for incoming calls and notifications, of course, but you can also sync the light show to your games or music, choose from ten pre-made light shows, or make your own.. There’s also a ColorCatcher app that allows you to snap a photo of something and generate a theme based on the colors. These themes extend to the LED back, though we can’t see many people wanting the LEDs to light up constantly when they’re using their phone.. It’s fun, but ultimately it’s a silly gimmick, albeit a silly gimmick that the makers have really committed to. If you ever longed for an LED array on the back of your phone, the Alcatel A5 LED is going to delight you. The question is – has anyone ever longed for an LED array on the back of their phone?. The Alcatel A5 LED is a chunky, sturdy-feeling, plastic phone. The front is all-glass with a speaker for calls at the top, flanked by the front-facing camera and flash, and the standard Android capacitive touch buttons at the bottom.. There's a permanently visible round symbol for the home button, with the back and multitasking buttons just lighting up when used.. On the right spine, there’s a lightly textured power button with a volume rocker above it. Up top we have a standard 3.5mm headphone port, and the bottom edge hosts the main speaker, microphone, and micro USB port.. Flip over to the back and you’ll see the camera and flash in the top left corner. The Alcatel A5 LED comes with a slim, dark plastic back with a brushed metal effect, or you can switch in the thicker, grille-patterned, partially translucent cover that houses an array of 4 x 9 multi-colored LEDs.. Switching covers, or indeed fitting the SIM or microSD card requires you to prise off the back, which extends around the frame. There’s a small slot to stick your nail into, but the covers are quite tough to remove.. The LED cover looks quite good at rest, but it’s sure to grab the attention of your friends, colleagues, and random passers-by the minute it lights up. The general reaction was a bemused smile, but my kids (who are 8 and 5 years old) really loved it.. Unfortunately, the LED cover renders NFC useless, so you’ll need to switch to the slim back if you want to use that.. Ultimately, it’s a dull, but inoffensive design and the only omission that rankled is the complete lack of a fingerprint scanner, meaning you’ll need to rely on an old-fashioned PIN or pattern to protect your phone from prying eyes.. Disappointing when you consider that the Moto G5 has a nice indented fingerprint sensor on the front.. Your phone’s display is one of the most important features, because you’ll probably be staring at it for hours and hours every day. The Alcatel A5 LED has a 5.2-inch IPS LCD. It’s a decent enough size, and you can crank the brightness up fairly high, but if you aren’t dead-on when viewing it, then it goes dull quickly.. Colors are quite good and there’s a MiraVision calibration tool in the settings, so you can fine tune it to fit your preferences.. We’re disappointed by the 720 x 1280 resolution, considering the Moto G5 has a smaller screen, but manages to be 1080p. The screen isn’t the worst thing about the Alcatel A5 LED, but we would have preferred a 1080p resolution in a screen this size.. Next Page What’s it like to use?.

Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Features: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Digital image stabilization. Octa-core, 1500 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

The Alcatel A5 has removable backs, one of which is a grid of customizable disco lights and another one of which is a big speaker. PCMag reviews products independently , but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page. BARCELONA — LG says "play more," but if you want to play around at Mobile World Congress this year, get hold of an Alcatel A5 LED. This midrange smartphone combines a dash of Motorola's modular back concept with pulsing lights and pumping bass, making for a fun, unusual party phone .. I'll get to the basic specs in the minute, but the point of the A5 LED is its removable back accessories. The first is a grid of colored LED lights, eight by four, that change color and behavior based on things happening on your phone. You can use a built-in app to theme them to complement your clothing, or have them react as a visualizer for your music.. If you insist on being serious, the LEDs can also pop up patterns for different kinds of messages and different callers, for instance, flashing red when you get a message from your boss, or green for a text from your significant other.. It's silly and useful and fun. It reminds me of a really old Nokia phone, the 3220 , which had rubber bumpers with pulsing disco lights. The A5 LED is going to be inexpensive, too, although Alcatel didn't give me a price at our MWC briefing. While other manufacturers compete with shimmery, serious phones, the A5 is purely for the inner (and outer) teen.. There are two other backs, too. One of them is a big speaker with a kickstand. It's made of white plastic, and is an oval that sticks out from the back of the phone. It's like a discount version of Moto's JBL speaker mod , and sounds like one, too: loud but not as rich. The third back is an unusually slim 3,000mAh battery.. I've been doing this for many years now. It's not boring and it's not expensive, and you don't see those two things together too often.. As for the specs, the A5 has a 5.2-inch 720p LCD, an octa-core Mediatek MT6753 processor, and "Android 6.0," which Alcatel said might change in the US model, although it offered me no guarantees. (Here's to hoping for Android 7.1.) It has 8MP and 5MP cameras that record 1080p video, 16GB of storage and a microSD card slot, 2GB of RAM, and a 2,800mAh battery. Alcatel will probably create a version for any US carrier that wants one —t hat's the company's general strategy.. Alcatel spun out a bunch of other products here at MWC, but none are as entertaining as the A5 LED. The Plus 12 is a Windows 10-powered 2-in-1 laptop, but it has a slow Celeron N3350 processor and likely won't appear in the US. It's technically interesting because the keyboard essentially has a low-end smartphone in it to connect the laptop to LTE networks, but that's just a curiosity.. The U5 and A3 are basic smartphones, like Alcatel's Pop series, and may pop up on prepaid carriers.. But the A5 LED is clearly the breakout. If it's handled well by a prepaid carrier in the US —like Boost, for instance — it could be a thriller. If you live in a city with public transportation, expect to see a lot of kids hanging out by train doors with pulsing disco lights on the back of their phones..

Alcatel A5 LED, Alcatel A3 hands-on. Alcatel Android Windows 10 MWC2017. The A5 LED is the top-specced one of this Alcatel bunch, but even so it won't be topping any benchmark charts with its MT6753 chip and 2 gigs of RAM. It's got a neat trick up its sleeve though - it's got an LED-equipped back cover.. The 4x9 array of RGB LEDs is controlled by an app and can can be set up to light up for notifications, or just flicker one of a number of pre-set dynamic effects. It's an entire light show, not just a static on/off type of thing. Additionally, you can have the LEDs perform a show based on the music you're listening.. It's not a one-trick pony, the A5 LED. You see, the LEDs are part of the back cover, and there are other interchangeable covers which bring different functionality (or should we drop the 'different' there?). Think MotoMods, minus the magnets - the covers here rely on low tech, but positively reassuring plastic clips, quite like the back panels all phones used to have before everyone started sealing the batteries inside the body.. Don't call them Mods, but that's pretty much what they are. There is a battery pack cover adding precious milliamp hours to the 2,800mAh built-in capacity. It's got a push-button with a 3-LED charge indicator.. The other cover we got to see packs a speaker in an admittedly rather oddly shaped body that's not too comfortable to carry around at all times, but hey - it can pump out more decibels than a tiny in-phone speaker. Battery pack cover • Speaker cover with kickstand extended. Mind you, there are also plain covers - no LEDs, no battery, no nothing, just a panel to cover up the back. You can tell by the absence of photos of those that we didn't find them particularly interesting.. Looking at its front the Alcatel A5 LED is a rather unassuming black tile of a phone, but you can't expect it to be one-of-a-kind front and back. If we have to point something out, it's that the display is a touch too reflective.. Alcatel A5 LED from different angles. The Alcatel A3 is a notch below the A5 LED in the lineup, yet it offers a higher-res camera and a fingerprint sensor on its back. It also looks pretty sleek, as long as you keep the display turned off. Light it up though - that's one huge black bezel.. The back has a nice grippy texture, which makes for a secure hold, and overall the device feels well put together. It certainly doesn't scream 'entry-level' quite the same way that the U5 does, but the 'Affordable premium' tagline Alcatel has assigned to it is only half right (hint: not the second half).. Bezel exposed • Back looks nice • Is grippy, too. Alcatel U5, Alcatel PLUS 12 hands-on. Alcatel A5 LED, Alcatel A3 hands-on 3.

I don't think you're ready for this LED-y. We are part of The Trust Project. The phone world is full of gimmicky-sounding stuff - but nothing comes close to the Alcatel A5-LED and its illuminated light show.. This is an absolutely mad phone that packs a wedding DJ’s sketchy disco lighting rig onto its back.. That might sound like the phone equivalent of booking a magician for your friend’s 30th Birthday: embarrassing for everyone involved. But in action, the Alcatel’s light show looks far cooler than it has any right to.. It’s a shame, then, that the phone underneath is a bit of a stinker, suffering from serious performance issues and a low-quality camera.. Alcatel A5-LED Design: Super Laser Disco 2000. First off, let’s get to the bottom of how the Alcatel A5’s LED-covered back works. A 4x9 array of multi-colour LEDs sits behind a thin translucent layer of plastic and mock grille pattern built into the back.. Putting these layers between you and the LEDs is why the Alcatel A5 LED looks far less cheesy than it could, as the light is diffused rather than in-your-face. But, yes, it does and always was going to have a whiff of brie hanging around it.. The LEDs fire off when you take the phone out of standby, when you get a call or notification, or when you play music. An app called Light Show even lets you choose exactly which kind of show the A5 LED puts on.. There are virtual fireworks, a virtual fire and a few that fling waves of colour-changing LEDs down the phone’s back, (vaguely) in time with your tunes. For those after a more DJ-like look, one called Rhythm acts like a spectrum analyser, dancing around to the music’s waveforms.. Can’t you picture the 14 year-old Stormzy wannabes waving it about on the bus as the rest of the passengers quietly lose the will to live?. The Alcatel A5 LED isn’t for me. But even I can appreciate Alcatel hasn’t done a bad job here with the main event.. It is a pity the rest of the phone’s design doesn’t have quite the same dynamic sensibility. Coming from using the Sony Xperia XA1 , the A5 LED seems tubby.. Apart from the glass on the screen this is an all-plastic phone. But it’s not a hugely expensive one, so you might be able to see past the materials. And while its back is distinctive, the front is not. That said, it’s plain and inoffensive, with some light-up soft keys below the screen. The back also looks pretty good while the LEDs are sleeping.. The A5’s LED back comes off completely too, because it’s actually an optional ‘case’, although aside from the lip around the camera lens it seems just like the phone’s normal rear.. Alcatel A5-LED Screen: Not bad, not the best. Move past the light show on the back, and the rest of the phone is actually pretty pedestrian.. For example, the screen is a meagre 720p IPS LCD panel stretched over 5.2 inches - making it a little bit bigger, but a lot less sharp than the Moto G5’s.. The light pixellation isn’t glaringly obvious and the colour tone is pleasant. There’s a utility in the Settings menu that lets you jack up the colour saturation a little more if you like, but I’m happy with how it looks straight from the box.. Peer a little closer and you’ll see this isn’t the best LCD screen going, though. Brightness takes a hit at any angle other than ‘dead on’, and the backlight is only just bright enough to cope with those screen-testing bright-but-cloudy days.. At an extreme angle there’s also some contrast shift visible in the A5’s screen. It’s the sort of angle you’d only look at the phone from if you end up stuck under a fallen bookcase and need to reach the phone to call an ambulance. But it does tell us this isn’t the latest, greatest screen panel going.. Alcatel A5-LED Software: Old Android in a Face Mask. The A5 is hardly cutting-edge when it comes to software, either. It runs Android 6.0 rather than the current 7.0 version, meaning you miss out on Google’s revamped notification system.. Alcatel has also stuck a custom interface on top, but all this does is smear some slightly dodgy styling on the OS, rather than totally changing how it feels. The vertical ‘white page’ apps menu and simple home screens of Android 6.0 are in-tact.. Changes include the option to pick how your apps are arranged in the apps menu (by date, alphabet, or most used) and that the A5 LED goes heavy on themes. Some of the icons really are the design equivalent of the Comic Sans font.. There’s a theme store, like you’d find on a lot of custom Android interfaces, but the theme camera app is more unusual.. Take a picture and the ColorCatcher app makes a theme based on the colours in the image. As neat an idea as it is, it makes 90 per cent of you app icons the same colour, which looks pretty terrible. After a few assaults on the senses, I switched back to the default theme.. Alcatel A5-LED Performance & battery life: Sludgecore. The dodgy skin will cheapen Android if you’re not careful, but the real issue is how slow the A5 LED makes Android feel. This phone is consistently lumpen, even though it has what sounds like a decent processor.. It uses the MediaTek MT6753, an octa-core 1.3GHz CPU with Cortex-A53 cores and a Mali-T720 GPU, which is then mated with 2GB of RAM.. The A5 LED should, in theory, be quick. Apps can take what feels like an age to load, you’ll often be left waiting for the keyboard to catch up with your typing, and the phone is just not responsive enough. At times it’s painful to use.. There’s no explanation for this in CPU benchmarks, as it scores a perfectly good 2503 points in Geekbench 4, just a little under that of the Motorola Moto G5. It must carry around its system memory in the equivalent of a carrier bag with a load of holes in the bottom.. Proving the problem is not as simple as “the processor isn’t fast enough”, games like Asphalt 8 run just fine. This means there’s some hope that performance will improve significantly with a software update. But let’s not hold our breath, eh?. The A5 LED is a bit of a rollercoaster: the OK parts are a reprieve in between the lurch you feel when you find another bad feature. Battery life is another of those bad parts.. Right now it’s 2pm and the phone is at 8% battery. Granted, I’ve been playing about with the LED feature a little, but that’s a disaster by any standard.. The A5 LED even seems to drain fairly quickly on standby. Like the general performance, stamina is almost inexplicably bad. There’s a 2800mAh battery behind the back cover, which should in theory be perfectly fine for a mobile of this size and resolution. Switch off the LED rear completely then avoid doing anything too taxing and you might get it to last a day, just.. Very slow charging compounds the problem. This might be the lowest-to-charge phone I’ve used in years, taking several hours to reach full charge rather than the usual two and change.. Are there any good notes to finish? The A5 LED’s bottom-loaded speaker isn’t truly dreadful, so if you need me I’ll be the one annoying pensioners on the bus with LEDs a-pumping.. Alcatel A5-LED Camera: Slow and Steady Gets Bored and Walks Off. The camera is also severely held back by poor speed. Its app takes a long time to load, there’s huge post-shutter-press lag when first shooting a new scene, and checking your images after taking them is unacceptably slow.. Alcatel’s camera app is remedial too. It’s one of those popular iPhone camera app copycats. The layout is clean enough, but there’s no Auto HDR, and using the separate HDR mode for a holiday snap might mean you miss your flight home. The A5 LED also uses extreme spot metering, where the brightness of the photo is determined solely by the small part of the scene you tap. Sometimes it makes getting a properly exposed photo tricky.. Image quality is thankfully not as bad as the camera’s performance. The A5 LED has an entry-level camera on the back that is miles off what you get with the Moto G5 or Sony Xperia XA1, but can still look reasonable on the phone’s screen or even a monitor.. However, using its widescreen mode it only captures as many pixels as you’ll find in the Sony Xperia XZ Premium ’s screen, so you can’t really zoom in much before everything starts looking blurry. Photos aren’t good, but they aren’t embarrassingly bad either.. Around the front sits a 5MP selfie camera with its very own LED flash. Image quality is fine given the low spec of the sensor.. The A5 LED is a fun gimmick, tacked onto a bad phone - the opposite of what you might expect with a high-concept mobile like this.. Its back looks pretty good when the lights are off, and there are enough light modes for it to work like a cheesy mobile DJ at house parties. But it fails as a normal phone, though.. Aside from feeling a bit chubby next to some, the hardware is fine enough. Performance is what lets the Alcatel A5 down. Bad battery life, laggy general performance and an extremely slow camera make you wonder if the optimisations were properly finished before going on sale.. I’ll happily take another look if software updates arrive to fix these problems, but right now, even the budget price isn’t enough to make this pocket-friendly rave machine light up my life..

Alcatel A5 LED review Alcatel has packed an LED light show into a phone - we just wish it had done it with a better phone. LED light show looks better than you might expect.

This is the Alcatel A5 LED, one of several affordable new Androids the manufacturer is introducing this year at MWC. Now, when you're talking about hardware that's on the seriously low side of the performance spectrum, it can be tricky to conjure up the appropriate level of excitement. But when Alcatel showed us a phone with its back studded with an array of multi-color LEDs, our interest was piqued. It turns out that the LED light show is only the half of it, though. -------- PhoneArena.com is your ultimate source of mobile tech news, reviews, and info.

The Alcatel A5 LED comes with a 5.2-inch 720p IPS display, 1.5 GHz octa-core processor, 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of storage, an 8-megapixel auto-focus camera and an additional 5-megapixel selfie unit on the front.

Keys: Right: Volume control, Lock/Unlock key. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Features: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Digital image stabilization. Octa-core, 1500 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. 2 GB RAM (666 MHz) / LPDDR3. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Supported formats: MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV, M4A (Apple lossless), AMR, OGG, MIDI.

Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Moto G5 Read our full Moto G5 review Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus Read our full Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus review Moto G4 Play Read our full Moto G4 Play review. The Alcatel A5 LED is a straightforward Android phone with a reasonable set of specs at a fairly low price.. But the only differentiating feature is the LED back cover. Take that away and you have a below average budget Android phone.. If you’re on a tight budget and you want something a little bit different, then the eye-catching LEDs might just reel you in. Alcatel seems to be courting the youth with a focus on flashy aesthetics, but the style fails to mask a serious lack of substance – the lights are on, but nobody is home.. No, we can’t recommend that you buy the Alcatel A5 LED, because there are superior alternatives. Even if Alcatel sorts out the dodgy performance with a software update, this phone is mediocre all the way through. You would have to be deeply in love with the LED back to make this phone worth considering.. The following three options can all be had for a similar price, but for a top budget phone you needn’t look beyond the Moto G5.. At £170/AU$299 (around $220), exactly the same starting price as the Alcatel A5 LED, the Moto G5 beats it on every front. It has a sharper screen, a metal body, a slick fingerprint sensor, better battery life, a far superior camera, and the list goes on.. The Moto G5 sports a newer version of Android that’s cleaner and nearer Google’s vision of the platform. Despite the Alcatel A5 LED scoring better in benchmarks, the Moto G5 is much smoother in everyday use. LED back aside, this is a walkover for the Moto G5.. The Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus was slightly more expensive on release, but it can now be had for £170 (around $220/AU$280) at Amazon. It’s quite similar to the Alcatel A5 LED in some respects. There’s also a 5-inch 720p display and a 2,700mAh battery.. But there are things that elevate the Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus. It boasts 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and most importantly has a much better main camera than the Alcatel A5 LED. You’ll find a 16MP main shooter backed up by an 8MP selfie cam on the Wileyfox. It has a decent fingerprint scanner, too.. At around $150/£130/AU$250, the Moto G4 Play is something to look at if your budget is seriously constrained. It’s the closest of our competitors to the Alcatel A5 LED, if you’re just looking at the spec sheets. It has a 5.0-inch 720p screen, runs Android 6.0, and has 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage.. The cameras are 8MP and 5MP, just like the A5 LED, and the battery is also rated at 2,800mAh. The one big difference is the low-end Snapdragon 410 quad-core chipset in the Moto G4 Play which scored so woefully in our benchmark test.. Prev Page Battery life and camera.

Share your thoughts with other customers. There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Brilliant Modular phone for an affordable price. I purchased Alcatel A5 led, its pretty interesting that alcatel has come up with such an innovative product at this price. The mods that come with it are very cool and useful. I’ve always had trouble carrying a power bank all the time, mainly because I watch a lot of videos I often run out of battery. The power mod adds additional battery which helps me go on even more. The LED mod is fun too, you can sync your music to the lights on your phone. However I found the battery mod to be the best. The phone is also pretty cool, good performance. It is good for people who are looking for something new and unique. PRO Battery Mod gives total battery for 6000 mah, last for 2-3 days led mod at parties is a good conversation starter Only other modular phone Moto Z Mod is twice the price and mod needs to be bought separately CON Only 2 mods are available yet. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars 3 phones in 10,500. It is a modular phone with LED lights and additional power back. I could not believe such bad reviews reviews because they seemed fake…none of them was even certified. I called the service centre to clarify myself and the person was helpful and seemed like I will not have a problem in service. Searched online and there are 450 service centers so my biggest concern was taken care of. Coming to the product there is nothing in the market which has anything similar. A moto Z with 2 mods will be costing around 40,000. LED cover : No actual use but a lot of fun with party lights and light notifications. The drainage on battery is also not too much. Light is quite bright in dark.. power cover mod: It will make the phone last for 2-3 days with normal usage. Much more than any other phone that I know of. The cover is not bulky at all so goodbye to big power banks. Only thing is to charge the back cover the phone will charge first then the battery pack ( cant be charged separately). you get used to it and maybe it is better this way. I would recommend to buy till the time price is low. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Alcatel A5 is a great phone. The led feature makes it cool and ....

Modular phone with Changeable covers of different funcfionlity makes this product unique.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars Alcatel as a brand should be avoided, no service no spares no accessories no updates so no bugs fixed.

Our Alcatel A5 LED review highlights an affordable Android smartphone that would make the perfect gift for younger phone users and teens. The LED light show cover is the star attraction, whereas everything else fits into what we would expect from a 2017 budget phone.. Metallic frame and a HD display. The Alcatel A5 LED has just a touch of premium with its metallic frame. In the box, you will find two back covers. The first is the standard Metallic Black cover, which gives the phone an overall thickness of 7.7mm and a weight of 137g. The second is the LED back cover and when this is fitted the phone has a thickness of 10.2mm.. The 5.2” display has HD resolution (1280 x 720 pixels) and this gives plenty of detail for viewing webpages, looking at images and for watching videos. A Mediatek 1.3GHz octa-core processor with 2GB RAM runs the show and this offers minimal lag when switching between apps or when playing graphics intensive games.. The Alcatel A5 LED has a 16GB memory and 10GB of this is free for transferring over your content from an old smartphone. There is a microSD card slot, so you can boost the memory in the future, by up to 128GB.. New: Huawei Nova 2S review. You can secure the phone with a PIN or password and when you have done this, you can use the phone in Private Mode or activate the Smart Lock feature. With Smart Lock, you can have the phone remain unlocked when in safe environments, like your home, if you wish.. Notifications - The LEDs can alert you to social media notifications, alarms and calls. As an example, the background lights up as blue for Facebook and the letter F scrolls across the cover. For Snapchat, the background lights up as yellow and the letter S scrolls across the cover. Light Show - You can play music and the LEDs create a light show that is linked to the tempo of the music. Colour Catcher 2.0 - Here you can create LED back cover themes that are inspired by up to five colours from any image or object.. The Alcatel A5 LED has a standout feature, which is the Lightup+ LED cover. This cover incorporates 35 LEDs and the fun features that these give are controlled through the Light Show app.. The features of the LED cover include:. The Alcatel A5 LED runs on Google’s Android 6.0 MarshMallow operating system and this brings with it great apps and features, such as Google Voice Typing, Maps, YouTube, Google Now and Chrome.. New: EE Hawk review. Alcatel has added a WallShuffle feature and this gives you a different lock screen background, every time that you wake the phone up.. The Alcatel A5 LED has a 13MP camera with a dual tone LED flash. There are plenty of camera features to help you get good photographic results and these include Instant Collage, PANO, low light enhancement, anti-shake, auto scene detection, video stabilisation, time-lapse and 1080p (Full HD) video recording.. The 8MP Selfie camera has its own LED flash and this is very useful for taking selfies on a night out. You can use Face Beauty enhancements to perfect the results or have a little fun with Face Show animations.. The 2,800mAh battery performs well and gives up to 15.5 days of standby or up to 21 hours of talk time.. Next: ZTE Axon M review. 300 MB data. 500 MB data. 1 GB data.

Single Review, online available, Short, Date: 11/15/2017. 50% Alcatel A5 LED review Source: Techradar Alcatel is still taking a gimmicky approach to the budget Android phone market, but a flashy LED array fails to mask a long list of distinctly disappointing compromises. Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 08/18/2017 Rating: Total score : 50%. 60% Alcatel A5 LED Source: Trusted Reviews The Alcatel A5 LED is certainly different, and while the LED-packed back is eye-catching, there are too many problems at the phoneâs core to make this a serious consideration over the Lenovo Moto G5.

Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 06/08/2017 Rating: Total score : 40%. Alcatel A5 LED hands-on review Source: Stuff TV The A5 LED is undeniably attention-grabbing, and the price is right too. Itâs set to arrive in Europe from May onwards for â¬199, which should mean Â£170 here in the UK. Thatâs not bad at all given the spec, and an absolute bargain if you want a unique phone thatâs guaranteed to grab attention. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 02/28/2017. Alcatel A5 LED Source: Trusted Reviews The big question is whether you can get more phone for your money, and while we need to live with the A5 for a bit before properly judging it, my suspicion is it will pale in comparison to affordable wonders like the new Moto G5, which is available at the same price point but boasts superior hardware and newer software.

This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. The former French manufacturer of telecommunication equipment merged to Alcatel-Lucent in 2006. Several business segments were sold to other companies, so the Alcatel brand is now used by various companies. The Chinese company TCL uses the brand names "Alcatel One Touch" and "Alcatel Idol" for smartphones and tablets.. The market share in the smartphone + tablet segment is very small, but there are quite some recent reviews in different languages. The ratings are average (as of 2016)..

It's a decent lower-midrange phone, but its vivid LED backlights make it stand out.. - Mar 3, 2017 1:58 pm UTC. Awesome or awful? Well it's in the eye of the beholder.... This app lets you configure the lights.. The A5 comes with a rather colourful/playful Android skin.. BARCELONA, Spain—It’s not easy for a phone to stand out when once-impressive features such as multiple cameras and sub-8mm thickness are now normal. Alcatel manages it, however, with the A5 LED by using a completely different tactic: it has a bunch of RGB LEDs that perform a light show whenever you get a notification or play music, or pretty much. whenever else it has even the slightest excuse to fire them up.. Many will be instantly turned off by the design; it’s a fairly cheesy gimmick, but Alcatel has pulled it off rather well. The lights are multicolour LEDs sitting behind a frosted back cover that diffuses the light. There’s also a fine black honeycomb pattern on top of that, which further removes some of the potential for gaudiness in the concept. Grudgingly, I have to admit the Alcatel A5 LED could look a whole lot worse than it does.. Enlarge / Mmts mmts mmts. These lights fire up when you get a notification, or when the phone is brought out of standby, but their behaviour is customisable too. You can tweak everything in an app called Light Show.. While there are presets for the various light actions, like acting as a light-up histogram when you play music, or forming a blue “F” when a Facebook notification arrives, you can also programme in your own patterns. This interface looks a little like the phone LED alternative of a Korg Kaoss Pad sampler , with a grid of squares that relates to LED zones on the back. There seem to be more LEDs than squares though, so users don’t appear to have direct control over every LED.. The Alcatel A5 LED cares more about injecting a bit of fun than offering a tool that lets you compose an LED son et lumière. These lights are dynamic, though: they don’t just sit there like cheap Christmas lights, but dance up and down the phone. There are presets for their motion, including such categories as “fireworks,” “meteors,” “stars,” and “rain”.. To be honest, it’s the sort of thing most people might want to see about three percent of the time. So it is reassuring to hear the lights are actually removable; users will eventually be able to replace them with something else like an extended battery pack, thereby leaving a much plainer and probably less annoying phone. When in use the LED cover stays in place using a magnetic connector, letting it hook up to the phone’s battery.. Under its attention-grabbing rear, the Alcatel A5 LED is a decent, if not quite Moto G -beating, lower-to-midrange phone. It has a 5.2-inch 720p IPS LCD screen, which is a bit disappointing when phones at a similar price are starting to feature 1080p displays.. Further Reading Moto G5 Plus hands-on: Solid camera, stock Android, sweet price—sign me up. Enlarge / The A5 comes with a rather colourful/playful Android skin.. It looks fine given the price, but you really do need to be drawn in by the LED-rave backside for this phone to make sense.. The other specs roughly match the screen. The rear camera has an eight-megapixel sensor, and the Alcatel A5 LED runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow rather than Android 7.0 Nougat. There’s a custom skin too, one with a more juvenile look than standard Android.. Processors similar to the A5 LED’s MediaTek MT6753 CPU have struggled with high-end games in 1080p phones in the past, but as this one has a 720p screen we doesn’t envision too many frame rate-related issues. The Alcatel A5 LED also has 16GB storage, expandable using microSD, and a 2,800mAh battery.. At a similar price, the Lenovo Moto G5 beats the Alcatel A5 LED on specs, but that’s no surprise as this is a quirky device with a USP, not a specs monster. In Europe the Alcatel A5 LED will cost €200, which will probably equate to about £180.. You must login or create an account to comment.. ← Previous story Next story →.
