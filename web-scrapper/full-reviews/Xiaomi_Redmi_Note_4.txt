Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 review: Setting the benchmark for the budget segment. Xiaomi's Redmi Note 3 was one of the best-selling devices of 2016 in India. With its successor, the company is looking to continue the momentum.. It's hard to follow up on the Redmi Note 3, but Xiaomi has managed to deliver a great successor in the Redmi Note 4. The phone now comes with more memory and storage, and the design changes make the device feel upmarket. Battery life has also received a boost thanks to the Snapdragon 625 SoC, and the camera is also better than what we saw last year. In short, this is the phone to beat in the budget segment.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Full review. Xiaomi had a great 2016 on the back of the Redmi Note 3. Over 3.6 million units of the phone were sold, allowing Xiaomi to cross $1 billion in revenue from the country for the first time.. However, competition in the budget segment has intensified, with Lenovo launching a bevy of models in the country last year. The Moto G4 series continues to sell in huge numbers, and the Z2 Plus picked up a discount recently, bringing the cost of the phone down to ₹14,999. For that amount, you get a handset powered by the Snapdragon 820. The Honor 6X — which has a dual camera setup — is slated to make its debut in India next week, and Samsung's Galaxy J7 and Galaxy On Nxt offer a lot of value for their asking price.. To counter the threat, Xiaomi is selling three variants of the Redmi Note 4 in India: the base model has 2GB of RAM and 32GB storage and retails for ₹9,999 ($145), then there's a variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage for ₹10,999 ($160), and the most interesting model is the one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage, which is available for just ₹12,999 ($190).. Can the Redmi Note 4 fend off its rivals and solidify its place in this category? Let's find out.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Specs. MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. 5.5-inch 1080p (1920x1080) IPS LCD panel 2.5D curved glass 401ppi pixel density. Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 Eight Cortex A53 cores at 2.0GHz 14nm. Adreno 506 with Vulkan API, OpenCL 2.0, and OpenGL ES 3.1 650MHz. 32GB/32GB/64GB microSD slot up to 128GB. 13MP with f/2.0 lens PDAF, LED flash 1080p video recording. 5MP with f/2.0 lens 720p video recording. LTE with VoLTE Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, GLONASS Micro-USB, 3.5mm audio jack, IR blaster. 4100mAh battery Fast charging (5V/2A). I (Harish Jonnalagadda) am writing this review after using the Redmi Note 4 variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage for two weeks in Hyderabad, India. The phone was connected to Airtel's 4G network for the first week, and Jio's VoLTE-enabled network for the rest of the review period. The phone was on the MIUI 8 beta channel, and received three updates with stability fixes.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Design and screen. The Redmi Note 4 is roughly the same size as its predecessor, but the design has been significantly altered. The phone now sports an all-metal chassis, with Xiaomi stating that it takes over 30 steps to turn the aluminum block into a finished piece. The phone is slightly heavier than the Redmi Note 3, but the added heft makes a huge difference in day-to-day usage. It's weighted perfectly, and Xiaomi managed to trim the overall thickness by 0.3mm, bringing the phone down to 8.4mm.. The Redmi Note 3 featured ungainly plastic at the top and bottom, but the Note 4 is entirely made out of aluminum. It instead has antenna lines at the back, which provide signal reception while also serving to break up the design. The phone isn't as curved at the back, with the chamfered edges making for better ergonomics.. These are all subtle changes, but they culminate to produce a phone that's vastly different. The end result is that the Redmi Note 4 feels great to hold and use. The overall fit and finish is one that befits a high-end device, and shows how far companies that cater to the budget segment have come.. Rounding off the design, the Redmi Note 4 has a speaker grille at the bottom, and although it is a single speaker, there are two sets of grills for the sake of symmetry. They're joined in the middle by a microUSB port, an odd choice in 2017 considering the industry is moving to USB-C. The Redmi Pro offers the newer USB-C port, and it is likely Xiaomi will switch to the standard from the next generation. At the top, you'll find the 3.5mm jack and an IR blaster.. The Redmi Note 4's design wouldn't look out of place on a high-end phone.. The power and volume buttons are on the right, and they offer decent tactile feedback. The SIM card slot is on the left, and you can either slot in two SIM cards (microSIM + nanoSIM) or a SIM card along with a microSD card. Round the back, the camera sensor and lens module are aligned with the fingerprint sensor, which is slightly recessed.. The front is dominated by a 5.5-inch display, and the addition of 2.5D curved glass makes a substantial difference when using the screen. The hardware navigation buttons are backlit, allowing for easy access at night. The display itself is brighter and has better color accuracy than the Redmi Note 3, and is easily one of the best panels in this segment.. You get the usual Xiaomi additions as well — there's Reading Mode, a blue light filter that makes it easier to read text at night. The mode lets you create a schedule to automatically enable it, and there's also the option of enabling it for selected apps. You can also adjust the color temperature to your liking, and toggle double tap to wake the screen.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Hardware. Xiaomi has excelled at offering great hardware in its budget phones, and that hasn't changed with the Redmi Note 4. The Chinese variant of the Redmi Note 4 is powered by MediaTek's Helio X20 SoC, but as Xiaomi isn't allowed to launch phones powered by MediaTek processors in India, the local variant is powered by a Snapdragon 625. Although the naming convention may lead one to believe that it is a downgrade from the Snapdragon 650 used in the Redmi Note 3, that isn't the case.. Unlike the 28nm Snapdragon 650, the Snapdragon 625 is built on the 14nm node, resulting in greater energy efficiency. The mid-range chip powers through everyday tasks with ease, and there wasn't any lag or slowdown in the two weeks I've used the phone. The 4GB of RAM also makes a difference when multitasking. The Snapdragon 625 can also handle visually-intensive games Modern Combat 5: Blackout or Asphalt 8 without breaking a sweat.. The Redmi Note 4 handles everything you throw at it with aplomb.. Even though the base model of the handset comes with 2GB of RAM, it is great to see Xiaomi moving away from 16GB internal memory and instead offering 32GB as the base storage. The phone comes with the usual range of connectivity options, including dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, LTE with VoLTE, and an IR blaster that lets you control a variety of appliances.. There's no NFC on the phone, but that isn't as major an omission as it is in Western markets. Android Pay is yet to make its debut in India, and it doesn't look like it will do so anytime soon.. The fingerprint sensor at the back is slightly recessed, making it easy to locate it with your finger. Its position beneath the camera module makes it easy to access, and the sensor itself is quick to authenticate. It is an always-on sensor, so you'll be able to unlock the device even when the display is off.. The speaker on the Redmi Note 4 is significantly better than its predecessor, and that's mainly due to its placement. Moving the speaker to the bottom means that it is no longer muffled when lying flat on a surface. The quality from the speaker is average — with sound getting distorted at high volumes — but at least you won't miss any incoming calls or notifications.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Software. MIUI 8 is Xiaomi's biggest release in a long time, introducing much-needed visual flair along with new customization options. The skin is based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow , and the phone is currently on the December security patch. Xiaomi is testing a Nougat preview of MIUI, and will be rolling it out widely in the coming months.. Setting up the Redmi Note 4 is a hassle, as MIUI still doesn't offer a way to restore apps and settings. So you'll have to individually install apps from the Play Store after booting into the phone. Another issue is with the phone's settings, which is a jumbled mess in its current iteration. Settings you'd normally find on other Android phones are inexplicably missing, and the ones that are available aren't located where you'd expect. For instance, if you want to enable installation of apps from outside the Play Store (useful for installing apps like Spotify), you'll have to go to Settings -> Additional settings -> Privacy ->Unknown sources. On most other phones, it is at Settings -> Security -> Unknown sources.. MIUI is frustrating to use at times, but it is packed with features.. Xiaomi is like the Alfa Romeo of phone brands. Its designs are evocative, and its customers are very passionate about the brand. And like all Alfas, Xiaomi's phones end up being quirky and frustrating to use. With the Redmi Note 4, that shows up in the form of annoying lock screen issues.. Lock screen notifications are a hit and miss in MIUI 8. While I receive all Gmail notifications, I'm yet to see one for Google's Messenger or Facebook Messenger. On the subject of notifications, MIUI 8 has a retooled notification shade that shows quick toggles and incoming messages in the same place. You can expand notifications, but doing so requires a zoom in gesture, not the best solution when you're using the phone one-handed.. Then there's the aggressive memory management. I use Minima for live wallpapers, and to get it to work, the app needs to be running in the background. Every time I closed the Minima app, the wallpaper switched back to the system default.. That said, MIUI 8 has a ton of new features and customizability. There's Dual Apps, which lets you run two instances of the same apps, allowing you to run two WhatsApp or Facebook accounts on the same phone. With Second Space, you can set up two profiles on the phone, with each featuring a different home screen. The profiles are sandboxed and use their own distinct data, but you do get the option to move data between profiles.. MIUI 8 also offers video editing tools in the gallery app, there's a new power-saving mode that lets you conserve the battery, and there's a Quick Ball feature that lets you access shortcuts with ease. You can also take scrolling screenshots, convert currency and other units on the fly, and much more.. Eight new features in MIUI 8. There's also a one-handed mode, which is accessible with a left-to-right (or vice versa) swipe gesture across the navigation keys. You can shrink the screen size down to 4.0 inches, 4.5 inches, or 3.5 inches, making it more convenient to use the phone one-handed. Xiaomi also offers several features for the Indian market. The dialer includes caller ID information for the delivery staff of Amazon, Domino's, Zomato, and other brands, making it easier for you to identify incoming calls.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Camera. The Redmi Note 4 has a 13MP camera with f/2.0 lens and PDAF. There's a 5MP camera up front that also sports an f/2.0 lens. The camera app is easy to use and comes with a wealth of options, including filters, beautify effects, and a manual mode that lets you tweak the ISO, white balance, and exposure settings. You can also take tilt-shift photos, set a countdown timer, shoot panoramas, and select from various scenes.. The camera does a great job of taking photos in well-lit conditions, and the resulting images are full of detail and offer saturated colors. You get more detail when shooting in HDR, but doing so takes slightly longer to shoot images. Images at low-light turned out decent, but you'll have to put in a lot of effort to get passable shots.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Battery life. The 4100mAh battery on the Redmi Note 4 is slightly larger than its predecessor, but the shift to 14nm has led to vastly increased battery life. The phone easily lasts a day on a full charge if you're a heavy user, and more often than not, you'll get a day and a half worth of usage out of the phone.. You can eke out two days' worth of battery from the phone with medium usage that involves a few hours of streaming music, watching videos, and browsing the web. The one downside with the battery is that the Redmi Note 4's fast charging is limited to 5V/2A. That's equivalent to Quick Charge 2.0 speeds, and correspondingly the phone takes nearly two hours to fully charge.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Bottom line. Xiaomi didn't try to re-invent the wheel with the Redmi Note 4. Instead, it focused its attention on fixing the few flaws the Redmi Note 3 had — camera and design. In doing so, it created a well-rounded device that offers excellent value for money. The fact that the phone is now available with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage is an added bonus.. The design of the phone makes it look much more premium than its predecessor, and the chamfers at the back result in better ergonomics. Same goes for the addition of 2.5D curved glass at the front, which ensures that the phone doesn't dig into your palm when you're using it.. If you want a phone with excellent battery life, just get the Redmi Note 4.. MIUI is still resource-heavy and buggy at times, but the latest iteration has fixed several problems from MIUI 7, and the interface in general looks much better. Battery life has also increased, making the Redmi Note 4 one of the best devices in this segment when it comes to battery longevity.. Like its predecessor, the Redmi Note 4 sets the bar for what phones can achieve in the budget segment. This is the phone to beat in 2017.. If you're looking for a budget handset, then the Redmi Note 4 should be high on your list. For just ₹9,999 — ₹12,999 for 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage — you get a phone with a great design and internal hardware, decent camera, and amazing battery life. There's no doubt that Xiaomi will sell millions of Redmi Note 4 units in India. The only question is if the manufacturer will be able to meet the initial demand. For now, the phone is up for sale exclusively on Flipkart.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

Redmi Note 4 (Gold, 64 GB) | Price Rs. 4GB RAM | 64GB ROM | Expandable up to 128GB.. 13MP Rear Camera | 5MP Front Camera.. Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 64-bit Octa Core 2GHz Processor.. Moto G5S (Lunar Gray, 32GB) | Price Rs. 4GB RAM | 32GB ROM | Expandable up to 128GB.. 16MP Rear Camera | 5MP Front Camera.. Redmi Note 4 is a better one.. Which phone is better Redmi Note 4 or Lenovo P2?. Though both Lenovo P2 and Redmi Note 4 have similar hardware, there are some key differences. For starters, the 5100 mAh battery of the P2 certainly provides more battery run-time compared to the Redmi Note 4. That said, the Note 4 comes out as a better looking and well built device compared to the P2. Not only that, the Note 4 has 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage compared to the 3GB of RAM with 32GB storage in P2.. If you look at it objectively, only on the basis of the specs, the Redmi Note 4 turns out to be a winner. Even in the design department, the Redmi Note 4 comes out as a winner. Xiaomi is now working to bring the MIUI 9 update for the Redmi Note 4 by next month. Redmi Note 4 is better than lenovo p2.. Is Redmi Note 4 worth buying or I should go for Redmi Note 3?. The Redmi Note 4 is the latest version in the Redmi Note series. Both phones have large Full HD displays, fingerprint sensors at the back, 4G LTE support, expandable storage, and larger battery capacities. Though the Redmi Note 4 uses the Snapdragon 625, it has been made using 14nm fabrication process to be battery efficient and also better heat dissipating. Though the Redmi Note 4 packs a 13MP camera as opposed to the 16MP camera of the Redmi Note 3, it still manages to capture better images. Overall battery life of both the phones is highly reliable and ekes a difference of the only couple of hours and not a significant one.. It has very low light, why so?. What exactly do you mean by low light? If you are talking about the low light camera performance, then it is a budget phone and uses an entry level image sensor. If you are talking about the screen brightness, then the screen offers 450nits of brightness. I suggest you switch off the auto brightness option from Display settings and then adjust it manually.. What is the difference between Redmi note4 and Samsung j7 (2015)?. Redmi Note 4 has a Full HD display, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, and 4100 mAh battery. Even the camera quality is better. Samsung Galaxy J7 (2015) has an HD display, 1.5GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, and 3000 mAh battery. Clearly, the Redmi Note 4 is the winner here..

If you have been following the XDA Portal, then you’ll know how excited we are about Google’s Project Treble. In a nutshell, Project Treble is perhaps the most significant low-level change to the Android Framework in years. It involves separating vendor Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs) from the Android Framework into a new vendor partition, and having the HALs communicate with the Android Framework through a new Vendor Interface via what’s called the HAL Interface Definition Language (HIDL). Doing this will theoretically speed up future software updates since device makers, also known as OEMs, will no longer have to wait for vendors like Qualcomm to upgrade their binaries before they can start work on the next version of Android (like Android P ).. All Android devices that launch with Android 8.0 Oreo MUST be Project Treble compatible (which means that they must pass the Vendor Test Suite [VTS]), however, devices that upgrade to Android Oreo are not required to be. (You can check if your device is Treble-compatible by following our guide here .) While Google has been working with some OEMs to ensure Treble-compatibility on some devices, device makers such as. OnePlus , Nokia , and Samsung. have rolled out Oreo updates without Treble compatibility.. This is particularly a disappointment among members of our community because of the potential that Treble-compatibility brings to custom ROM development. After theorizing how it might benefit the custom ROM community , I was personally able to boot a generic AOSP Android 8.0 Oreo build. (called a Generic System Image [GSI] by Google) onto my Huawei Mate 9. This opened up the floodgates of ROM development centered around the GSI, and other devices such as the Huawei Mate 10 , Honor 8 Pro, and Honor 9. among others are able to run stable builds of AOSP Android Oreo as daily drivers. I personally am running a so-called “Treble ROM” on my own Huawei Mate 10 Pro, and thanks to projects such as the Xposed Framework. with the GravityBox module , Substratum for themes , and my own framework overlay , there aren’t very many features that I’m missing.. So with all of the benefits that Treble seems to bring to custom ROM development, users have wondered if it is possible to “port” Treble compatibility. This is a challenge for developers as it means they have to first find space to use as a make-shift vendor partition (on devices that do not already have one) and then move all of the HALs out of the system partition into this new vendor partition, and then create the vendor interface themselves in HIDL. As always, developers of the XDA community were up to the challenge, and XDA Senior Member abhishek987. has just announced that he was able to successfully accomplish all of the above and thus bring. full Project Treble compatibility to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (mido).. How did he do it? He used the “cust” partition on the device for his make-shift vendor partition. The cust partition normally holds a lot of device-specific stuff from MIUI, so it’s essentially wasted space on an AOSP build. Using the approximately 830MB unused partition, he moved the vendor HALs from system into cust without needing to repartition—which was a justification that OEMs such as Nokia and OnePlus used in their statements about why they weren’t going to bring Treble compatibility to their devices.. Full Project Treble Compatibility on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. After some hard work getting the vendor interface working, he was able to boot up XDA Senior Member phhusson ‘s Android 8.1 Oreo GSI without much effort. (Note: phhusson told me that abhishek987 had to change things around for it to work due to a lack of a. “versioned VNDK.” Explaining that in detail would require another article on Treble, which I’m working on!). If you want to install this LineageOS 15.1 ROM onto your Snapdragon Redmi Note 4, then you’ll want to thoroughly read abhishek987’s announcement post since it contains important information about the new flashing instructions.. Install LineageOS 15.1 with Full Project Treble Support on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Snapdragon). This is without a doubt a major milestone in Treble-related custom ROM development. Once the developer posts his device trees, other custom ROM developers can re-base their ROM on this work—meaning you’ll see more than just LineageOS that is fully Treble compatible on the Redmi Note 4. And, now that this has been proven possible, we’re sure to see more developers attempt this on other devices. Indeed, I’ve already seen XDA Senior Recognized Developer codeworkx. attempt to bring full Treble compatibility on the OnePlus 5 /5T.. As for what this means going forward, Redmi Note 4 users have much to be excited about. Thanks to Treble support, the Redmi Note 4 should have a much, much easier time getting Android P up and running once the source code is made available. Treble is supposed to make it so a device with, say, Android 8.1 vendor is able to run an Android P system on top, but since Android P is not yet available we can’t test that claim ourselves. But when Android P does come around, we’ll be sure to try it out and potentially make the next big step in custom ROM development..

As ever with Xiaomi phones, the Redmi Note 4 is not officially available in the UK. You can buy it through third-party sites such as GearBest, where the 3GB RAM, 64GB storage model we reviewed currently costs £192.93 ( click here to buy the 3GB Redmi Note 4 ). A 2GB RAM, 16GB storage version is cheaper, currently £133.83 from GearBest ( click here to buy the 2GB Redmi Note 4 ). The phone will ship between 1- and 3 October.. Buying from China is not quite the same as buying from the UK, and apart from anything else you may be liable for import duty. Read our advice on buying grey market tech for more details.. Within this review we mention the Note 4’s predecessor, the Redmi Note 3, which is still available to buy from GearBest at £165.45 for the 2GB RAM, 16GB storage model ( click here to buy the 2GB Redmi Note 3 ). If you are going to buy the Redmi Note 3 we’d recommend instead paying £130.11 for the 3GB RAM, 32GB storage option ( click here to buy 3GB Redmi Note 3 ). Plus there’s the Redmi Pro, which sits above this Note 4 in Xiaomi’s Redmi line-up, an excellent phone that is available from GearBest for £258.81 ( click here to buy the Redmi Pro ).. You might also like to read our full Redmi Note 3 review and Redmi Pro review .. Something UK users should watch out for is that Xiaomi phones do not support 800MHz 4G, which is the only 4G band supported by O2 and piggybacking networks such as Giffgaff. Also see: Best cheap phones 2016 .. At 151x76x8.4mm the new Note 4 is roughly the same size as the Redmi Note 3 and a little tubbier at 175g (vs 164g), but much has changed. The design is significantly more attractive, now with a full metal build that feels much less cheap. Whereas the Note 3 features plastic parts at the top and bottom to improve signal, the Redmi Note 4 is all metal with those increasingly familiar white stripes top and bottom to ensure you can still get reception. It’s also flatter at the back, with chamfered edges and less rounded corners, yet feels every bit as good in the hand.. Something else gone from the rear is the speaker grille, and you’ll now find two rows of six drilled holes on the phone’s bottom edge, one either side of the now centrally mounted Micro-USB port. This is the same design as is used by the Redmi Pro (albeit with USB-C rather than Micro-USB), but don’t be fooled: it looks nicer, and sound is less likely to be muffled, but there’s still just a mono speaker lying below.. Things look different at the front too, and while you still get the three standard-Android touch buttons below the screen (as before the fingerprint scanner is rear-mounted below the camera) and the bezels are the same size, the new layout above the screen and 2.5D curved glass make it so much easier on the eye. The earpiece, front camera and proximity sensor are now symmetrical: dot, dash, dot rather than long dash, short dash, dot as seen on the Redmi Note 3. It’s a little thing, but it makes more difference than you might expect to the phone’s overall aesthetic appeal. Also see: Best Android phones 2016 .. On the top edge the headphone jack, IR blaster and mic have also switched places, but you’ll pleased to learn the volume rocker, power switch and SIM tray remain exactly where you would expect to find them.. Overall these changes make a massive improvement to the look and feel of the Redmi Note 4, resulting in a phone that would look more at home in the flagship Mi family. This is something we also saw in the excellent Redmi Pro, which many people have been comparing to this Note 4. We can certainly see the similarities, especially given the very good 5.5in full-HD IPS panel that adorns the front of each device, offering strong clarity and colour reproduction. The 2.5D glass laid on top makes a huge subconscious difference to your perception of the phone, too: running your finger over a smooth surface rather than a raised lip just feels so much more natural. Also see: Best phablets 2016. There are some significant differences between the two, though - and not least the £65 price hike. The Redmi Pro features a dual-lens camera, and moves the fingerprint scanner to a physical home button at the front. It is also fitted with USB-C and the deca-core Helio X25 in place of the Note 4’s Micro-USB and Helio X20.. The core specifications of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 are excellent for a sub-£200 phone. Moving on from the octa-core Helio X10 chip found in the Redmi Note 3 here there’s a deca-core 2.1GHz Helio X20. (The Redmi Pro is also a deca-core phone, but fitted with the Helio X25.) This is paired with Mali T880 graphics, 3GB of RAM and - just as 32GB is beginning to become the norm - a colossal 64GB of storage, which is double the Note 3’s maximum of 32GB. You can add to this too, with support for microSD up to 128GB (though you do so at the expense of dual-SIM functionality - more on this later). To be fair, there is also a version of the Redmi Note 4 that comes with 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, but at this price we’d recommend the 64GB model. Also see: What's the fastest phone 2016?. It’s impossible for us to accurately compare performance with the Redmi Note 3, because when we reviewed the earlier Xiaomi we were testing the 2GB RAM, 16GB model rather than the 3GB RAM, 32GB storage option. The amount of storage shouldn’t affect our benchmarks, but it’s impossible for us to say how much the extra gig of RAM would.. It’s interesting, then, to find that the Redmi Note 3 scored significantly higher in Geekbench 3 than did the Redmi Note 4, with 4597 points against the newer phone’s 3009. The roles were reversed in AnTuTu 3D though, and more in line with what we would expect, with the Redmi Note 4 turning in 85,518 points against the Redmi Note 3’s 46,924 points. This is higher even than the Redmi Pro, which managed 79,487 points. (We haven’t noted the Redmi Pro’s Geekbench score because we used a later version of the test.). Why did the Note 4 score so much lower in Geekbench 3? Who knows - and to some extent it goes to show just how reliable are processing performance benchmarks. Real-world performance is therefore more important that that of synthetic benchmarks, and here we should say that in our ue of the Note 4 at no point did we find it slow. It may not be as fast as phones higher up Xiaomi’s range but it will do everything most users will require of it and more.. Getting back to the benchmarks, and we also ran the GFXBench graphics test. As we would expect the Redmi Note 4 outperformed the Redmi Note 3, with 31fps in T-Rex against the Note 3’s 22fps. This is also higher than the 25fps of the Redmi Pro, though it matches that phone on the more intensive Manhattan test with both recording 15fps. The Redmi Note 3 trails behind here with 8fps.. Our final benchmark is JetStream, which looks at JavaScript performance when browsing the web. The Note 4 is on par with the Redmi Pro, scoring a slightly lower 23.265 points against its 24.719 points. Unfortunately we do not have test results for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3.. The battery capacity has been upgraded to 4100mAh in comparison to the Note 3’s 4000mAh. We found we could get two days of use from the Redmi Note 4, but as always the runtime will depend on exactly what you do with the phone..

Ketan Pratap , 19 January 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 has been launched at a starting price of Rs 9,999. Three variants of this model will be sold in India. Gadgets 360 rates the 4GB RAM variant of the phone 8 out of 10. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 look and feel Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 specifications and features Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 performance. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is here, continuing the company's tradition of launching phones with good specifications at low price tags. The strategy has paid off spectacularly, as Xiaomi crossed the $1 billion revenue milestone in India last year. While the company's vast product portfolio now includes fitness bands, earphones, air purifiers, power banks, and other devices, smartphones continue to be the stars, and the Redmi series - of which the Redmi Note 4 is the newest member - has been a key contributor to its success.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 follows in the footsteps of the Redmi Note 3 and Redmi 3S , which were among the top selling devices online last year. The Redmi Note 3, in particular, saw a lot of success in the Indian market with over 2.3 million units sold. However, that model is almost a year old now , and on Thursday Xiaomi finally launched the Redmi Note 4. Much like its predecessor, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 model sports an-all metal body and boasts of impressive specifications. While the Chinese version of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 was unveiled in August last year with a MediaTek SoC, the one launched in India packs a Qualcomm chip. The Redmi Note 4 has been priced competitively and will be going up against some of the most popular smartphones in the market right now. Will the new Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 be able to continue the company's dream run in the Indian market, or will it turn out to be a run-of-the-mill device? Find out in our Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 review.. The Redmi Note 4 follows the Redmi Note 3 closely when it comes to design. The front panel of the Redmi Note 4 is very similar to that of its predecessor, with similar capacitive navigation buttons below the display and slim borders around it. There's also 2.5D curved-edge glass across the front, giving this phone a premium feel. The all-metal phone feels sturdy, and compared to the Redmi Note 3, the rear panel on the Redmi Note 4 is less slippery.. The rear of the Redmi Note 4 is a bit different though, featuring design contours more reminiscent of the Xiaomi Mi 5 ( Review ). There are fine antenna bands running across the top and bottom. The rear camera, dual-tone LED flash and fingerprint scanner are set up much the same as on the Redmi Note 3. One of the few differences between the two is that this time around Xiaomi has shifted the speaker grilles from the rear to the bottom. The bottom also houses a Micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, while the top packs a 3.5mm audio jack and an infrared (IR) emitter. The power and volume buttons are placed on the right, and can easily be accessed with fingers.. At 8.3mm, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is slimmer than its predecessor, and just one gram heavier. We had no problem using the handset with just one hand. The rounded edges of the Redmi Note 4 actually fit well in palm without causing any discomfort when used for long periods. When it comes to design, the Redmi Note 4 can be considered the best Redmi smartphone so far. It was launched in China in Dark Grey, and Gold, though Grey seems to have been replaced with an exclusive Matte Black option in India. We received a Gold unit for our Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 review.. The 5.5-inch full-HD IPS display has a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels, which works out to a density of 401ppi. Thanks to the full-HD resolution, text and images appear razor sharp. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 display offers punchy colours and decent viewing angles, while sunlight legibility is also great. The screen size makes the Redmi Note 4 well suited to watching videos and movies. You can adjust the colour temperature from the Settings app. A Reading Mode makes the display more comfortable to use while reading.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 launched in India is powered by the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 (MSM8953) processor clocked at 2GHz with an integrated Adreno 506 GPU. Xiaomi is selling three variants of this model in India: 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage; 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage; and 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The company provided us with a sample of the top end variant for our Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 review.. The handset has a hybrid SIM tray which supports one Nano-SIM and one Micro-SIM or a microSD card. Xiaomi notes that both SIM cards support 3G and 4G networks. The company has definitely taken note of complaints of the Redmi Note 3's 32GB microSD capacity limit. The Redmi Note 4 supports microSD cards of up to 128GB which should be sufficient for most people.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 has a non-removable 4100mAh battery which is marginally bigger than the 4050mAh one seen on the Redmi Note 3. There's a 13-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF (phase detection autofocus), and a dual-tone LED flash. There is also a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture and a fixed-focus lens. Users also get dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, USB OTG, FM radio, GPS/ A-GPS, Miracast, GLONASS, and BeiDou. Much like its predecessor, the Redmi Note 4 also gives NFC connectivity a miss. 4G and VoLTE are supported, and we were happy with call quality.. The Redmi Note 4 runs MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Xiaomi has added plenty of new features including Now on Tap which was one of the highlights of Android Marshmallow, introduced in 2015. Google's Now on Tap can be triggered within any app just by long-pressing the Home button, and can use what's on screen as context for your searches. MIUI 8 on the Redmi Note 4 looks light and polished compared to previous versions. We were impressed with the system animations, which look refreshing, including a neat one when you uninstall an app.. MIUI 8 comes with a new Gallery app that automatically syncs stored photos on the device with Mi Cloud. Users get 5GB of free cloud storage on signing up for an account. The Gallery app now comes with video editing and sharing features.. The Quick Ball feature, which was first seen on the Xiaomi Mi Max ( Review ), is available on the Redmi Note 4 as well. This is a hovering button that stays on the screen at all times, including on the lock screen, and lets users define up to five shortcuts for easy access.. With privacy in mind, the Redmi Note 4 offers Dual Apps and Second Space, two of our favourite software features. The Dual Apps feature, as the name suggests, creates two instances of any app on the same smartphone, so you can, for example, use two WhatsApp accounts at the same time. Second Space, on the other hand, lets users separate business and personal data on the same phone. The feature lets users use two entirely separate Google accounts.. Another highlight of the software is scrolling screenshots, which lets users take screenshots of entire Web pages. Xiaomi has also worked on its dialler app which is now light and easy to use. MIUI 8 brings a caller ID feature to the Redmi Note 4, which eliminates the need for third-party apps such as Truecaller. The Messages app has also received some much-needed tweaks in the latest version, such as the ability to bundle similar messages into folders. In our case, texts received from banks, food chains and other services were moved into one folder, which was helpful in prioritising what to check first. The preloaded Themes app offers plenty of options for wallpapers, ringtones, and icons.. Xiaomi has also included a one-handed mode, which basically shrinks the display to one side of the screen and lets users select effective screen sizes - 3.5, 4, and 4.5 inches.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 has plenty of preloaded apps including Security, Compass, Scanner, Recorder, Feedback, Mi Picks, Mi Community, Mi Remote, Music, Mi Store, Weather, and a default browser. Unfortunately, there is no way to uninstall the preloaded Xiaomi apps. We feel that Xiaomi should reduce the number of preloaded apps on its future devices or at least offer the option to uninstall some of them.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 was able to handle almost everything we threw at it, and we had no complaints with the octa-core processor. It handled heavy games with ease and we had fun playing Asphalt 8 and Dead Trigger 2 on the device. We were able to use the Redmi Note 4 over the course of a few weeks, and never felt that we needed a more powerful processor. Multitasking on the Redmi Note 4 was quick, and apps launched without delay. Our test unit with 4GB of RAM had enough free memory at any given time. We noticed that 1.8GB of RAM was in use at all times, leaving us sceptical about the experience we would have had using the variant with only 2GB of RAM, which could be more popular due to its lower price.. The Redmi Note 4 is very good for media playback thanks to the excellent IPS display, and it supports high-resolution video files, including 4K ones. The speaker at the bottom is decently loud and we didn't notice any distortion at higher volumes. Xiaomi didn't send us a headset with this unit, so we tested audio quality through our own headphones, and were happy enough.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 managed an impressive 65,560 in AnTuTu and 42,690 in Quadrant, which is higher than what we got from the recently launched Lenovo P2 ( Review ) and Asus ZenFone 3 ( Review ) both featuring the same Snapdragon 625 processor. GPU performance was also good, and we saw a healthy 28fps in the T-Rex test in GFXbench, and 9,029 points in 3D Mark Ice Storm Extreme. These scores are along the lines of what we expected, but it is worth pointing out that the Redmi Note 3 ( Review ) with a Snapdragon 650. There are plenty of modes to choose from in the camera app, including Beautify, Panorama, and Manual. In the Scenes mode, the device lets users choose from loads of options including portrait, landscape, sports, night, night portrait, beach, snow, sunset, fireworks, backlight, and flowers.You can also apply filters while taking photos, which is nice. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 camera app can record videos at full-HD (1080p) resolution and quality is pretty good. Selfies taken with the Redmi Note 4 had good colours and details, but again, those taken in well-lit situations were better than those taken in low light.. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 camera samples. The 13-megapixel rear camera of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 can take some decent landscape shots in well-lit as well as low-light situations. Macro shots also appear good, with proper colour accuracy and details. The PDAF feature lets the camera focus on subjects quickly. Low-light shots have good detail, though on zooming in one can see the graininess. The Redmi Note 4 was also able to take good photos of moving subjects.. Xiaomi has focused its efforts on improving camera quality on the Redmi Note 4 after complaints about camera quality on last year's model, and it's clear that things are better. However, we'd still like to see low-light performance improved.. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4's 4100mAh non-removable battery lasted for 15 hours and 10 minutes in our continuous video playback test, which is impressive for a battery of this capacity. In real-world use, the phone was able to last for up to two days. With heavy usage, we got to nearly a day and a half without needing to use any of the battery saving modes. We were especially impressed with the handset's ability to latch on to weak cellular as well as Wi-Fi network signals. We were not provided with a retail box with all accessories for our review, and so we can't comment on how long it would take to charge with the bundled changer. However, there is no support for quick charging, which would have been a welcome feature at this price level.. Verdict The Redmi Note 4 is a great package with the only downsides being its hybrid SIM slot, lack of quick charging, and excess of preloaded apps. We think that the Redmi Note 4 will provide tough competition to other smartphones in its price segment, and even some priced a little higher. It scores very well in terms of design, battery life, and performance. For those who are looking for a smartphone with a big screen and great battery performance on a budget, the Redmi Note 4 is easy to recommend.. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 has been launched in three variants in India. At a starting price of Rs. 9,999 (2GB RAM + 32GB storage), the Redmi Note 4 is definitely a compelling option for users who are looking for a low-cost device. Our impressions are based on the highest-specced variant, and given the difference in prices between the three, we would suggest people skip the lowest one if they can afford to. The version with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage has been priced just Rs. 10,999, while the version with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage - the one reviewed here - is also a reasonable step up at Rs.

To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Xiaomi just took the wraps off its long-awaited fourth edition of the budget Redmi Note series for bigger screen aficionados, and took us by surprise with the choice of specs. While the chassis design is still metal, the finishing work is now more polished, looks more premium, and the Note 4 is thinner than its predecessor, while still housing a giant 4000+ mAh battery. Seriously, if Xiaomi place such huge juicers in metal phones that are bordering on the 8mm mark, there is no reason for other makers to still ship flagships with 3000 mAh batteries that barely get you through the day.. Battery rants aside, the Note 4 and Note 3 are actually not all that different. The Note 4 is powered by the deca-core Helio X20 chipset, versus the Snapdragon 650 or Helio X10 of its predecessor - you get more raw speed with the MediaTek processors, but less stability and custom ROM support. While the Redmi Note 3 Pro with Snapdragon also comes with a 16 MP shooter, the Note 4 and "regular" Note 3 with MediaTek come with 13 MP cameras. Both the Note 4 and Note 3 have basic versions with 2 GB RAM, but the Note 4 starts you off with 32 GB storage instead of 16 GB, and that's about the hardware differences fit to print.. Now, when it comes to the Redmi Pro , it is obviously the upper midrange representative of the budget Redmi portfolio, as it comes with even thinner and more carefully crafted metal chassis, an elaborate dual camera, USB-C port, and the higher versions ship with Helio X25, 3/4 GB RAM and 64/128 GB storage. Naturally, this horese power superiority translates into a tad higher price, though we are talking about $200-$300 phones here, even when sold abroad, so who's counting..

But, with the release of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, Xiaomi seems to have discovered their style.. fingerprint reader and the metal surface craft, Redmi Note 4 almost appears to be a ditto copy of Redmi Pro. On the rear, we can see the. curviness on alternating facets, which provides a perfect grip for the hand. It is worth noticing that these are the same curves witnessed in Mi 5 and Redmi Pro, and the pattern will retain in the upcoming smartphones. With a massive battery, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 weighs 175 grams , is not floating at all but an average.. Even thought Redmi Pro inherits the same metal chassis but the most vivid difference between both. flagship is that Pro utilizes the brushed metal procedure, creating some streaks on the back along the smoothness. Meanwhile, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 uses the nanoscale ceramic blasting process , feel very delicate as the shine glitters in the eyes and even the surface is moderately rugged. Obviously, the inexpensive price is a factor here.. To make Redmi Note 4 flawless, time taking CNC integration technology is adopted making the borders smooth and premium to hold. However, since the front panel fabricates from plastic, the sense of fragmentation can be felt in the midway. The front design continues to be traditional and classic with the three touch-based buttons.. Still, there is a plus point, as Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 highlights 2.5D arc glass to exaggerate its charm further.. When it comes to the configuration, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 knows how to hit hard on the market, giving other manufacturers a tough time.. It’s remarkable and we never though that Xiaomi will use MediaTeK Helio X20 processor as the heart of flagship. We will like to highlight that Helio X20 relies on TSMC 20nm HKMG process technology. including 2 * A72 (2.1GHz), 4 * A53 (2.0GHz), 4 * A53 (1.4GHz). When combined, it makes a total of 10 core united by MediaTek customize MCSI interconnected bus connect. T880mp4 running at 700MHz as the GPU. In short, Helio X20 is a high-end processor used in a mid-tier priced terminal.. However, after this, Note 4 pursue two different pathways with the two variants:. 2GB RAM + 16GB ROM (Standard Edition) and. 3GB RAM + 64GB ROM (High Edition). Both versions support Micro-SD card (up to 256 GB).. We tested Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 on the following benchmarks shown above. On Antutu, the flagship was able to score. 82018 , while 16402 points for the 3D graphics. We also conducted a read and write speed test and the result favored Note 4 from the previous generations with a. random read speed of 21.09MB / s , and random writing speed of 8.50MB / s. Still, we think that the Chinese manufacturer should have used eMMC design to speed Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. However, the performance is worthy to be appreciated for crossing 80,000 points by a 135. What to hear the biggest selling point of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, apart from the price? Well, we are under that section. The flagship integrates a beautiful 5.5-inch display panel with a Full-HD breathtaking resolution along with 2.5D arc. Here the Redmi Note series breaks a trend, a tradition of 720p phones with the introduction of the 1080p display under a budget friendly flagship. telling and proving us that it’s not about resolution but colors, contrast, and brightness. That’s why they opted for Full HD screen in Mi 5, and now same can be seen in Note 4.. Under sunlight, the screen is exceptionally dimmed, but still, the display is clearly vivid. No change can be seen when observed with different view angles.. Helio X20 integrates the entire Cat 6 baseband network. allows Redmi Note 4 to supports Dual SIM and Dual Standby on the whole system function. We said the entire network, which also includes 4G +, VoLTE networks .. Still, the problem comes with the Hybrid SIM slot , where you have to lose dual networking if you opt for adding a Micro-SD card inside it. Sadly, another con is that the Micro-USB port seems to be a standard USB 2.0 , rather than USB Type-C. But all can be neglected when it comes to the cost.. However, Note 4 gets the upper hand with the functionality of IR port as a universal remote controller. Apart from this, the phone supports the latest Bluetooth v4.2.. Other common aspects are the five sensors: Fingerprint, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass. The gyro and the fingerprint sensors operate real quickly, under 0.1 sec. Even, the reception and the Wifi signals seem to be pretty high on the phone.. The camera of Redmi Note 4 can be a huge disappointment as the terminal features a 13 MP rear camera and a 5 MP front shooter along with Dual LED flash. Remember, we didn’t said Sony sensor, because it’s not. With the output it yields, it seems to be a Samsung or OV sensor. F2.0 aperture ensures sufficient light supporting the phase-focus function.. The camera interface is enriched with a variety of features when switched to manual mode and user-friendly when switched to automatic mode. Seriously, we don’t need any praises further because it’s MIUI 8 friends.. the back has some depth of field effect but still the color performance is not satisfaction. the perception of saturation and contrast.. Focusing is the only feature in Redmi Note 4, where it beats all the other Redmi terminals with a quick focus in no time.. Still, under low light and gloomy weather conditions, it fails to give an up to the mark,. Maybe, the firmware update will improve.. At last, the MIUI 8 Stable has arrived! Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 operates under it, based Android v6.0 (version number 8.6.8.20).. MIUI system after six years of development. The number of users has increased from the initial 100 to 170 million active users covering 156 countries and region, worldwide.. As shown above, MIUI 8 still followed the flat icon design which is quite lively, but also more daring color in line with today’s young people taste.. Suspension Ball function similar to iOS,. Meanwhile, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is powered by a massive non-removable 4100 mAh battery and supports MediaTeK PE 2.0 for a quick charge. At last, playing Pokemon Go for hours won’t be a problem now.. If you are interested in buying Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, you can buy it from Gearbest for a price of $200. We know the price is high because of high demand and recent release. It will decrease to the original after some time. Buy Redmi Note 4 (Standard Version) from GearBest. Buy Redmi Note 4 (High Version) from GearBest. Design & Appearance - 7/10. Hardware & Performance - 9/10. Screen & Display - 8/10. To be honest, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is an excellent budget friendly phone with an elegant design, detailed display, powerful hardware. No doubt, the camera is an average which won't be as good as Xiaomi's latest products (Yeah! We are talking about Xiaomi Redmi Pro). Everything is fair at a stupendous cost of $135. That's why Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is one of our top picks of 2016 when it comes to affordable phones.. Xiaomi Xiaomi Redmi xiaomi redmi note Xiaomi Redmi Note4.
