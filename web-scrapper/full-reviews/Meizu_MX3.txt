Meizu MX3 unveiled with Exynos 5 Octa, 5.1-inch screen, Wolfson audio and 128GB option. Meizu MX3 unveiled with Exynos 5 Octa, 5.1-inch screen, Wolfson audio and 128GB option. Ahead of main rival Xiaomi's big event later this week, Meizu has today unveiled its latest Android device, the MX3, at the Beijing National Aquatics Center. Like many recent flagship phones, this one finally breaks the previous 4.4-inch barrier to make way for a 5.1-inch display, though with an odd 1,800 x 1,080, 15:9 panel from Sharp and JDI to follow Meizu's string of odd aspect ratios. At the same time, the manufacturer has managed to keep the screen bezel at 2.9mm thick, making the carefully curved body 72mm wide (as well as 9.1mm thick and 143g heavy). This is apparently the result of Jack Wong's 30-plus handcrafted wooden prototypes, followed by some 3D scanning. Update: Our hands-on post is up as well!. Gallery: Meizu MX3 unveiled with Exynos 5 Octa, 5.1-inch screen, Wolfson audio and 128GB option | 29 Photos. As a close buddy of Samsung's semiconductor division, it's no surprise to see Meizu embracing an Exynos 5 Octa SoC for the MX3. Assuming It's the same 5410 variant as used by the Galaxy S 4 , we should be looking at with quad Cortex-A15 1.6GHz cores plus quad Cortex-A7 1.2GHz cores, along with 2GB of RAM and SGX544 MP3 graphics. As for the camera, rather than joining the 13-megapixel hype, Meizu's opted for Sony's third-generation 8-megapixel sensor, along with a fast f/2.0 lens (with second-gen sapphire glass), zero-delay image stabilization and a Fujitsu ISP that helps enable capture speed of up to 20fps. Sadly, the front-facing imager has a resolution of just 2-megapixels, which is dwarfed by many other Chinese options.. Another notable feature is that the MX3 comes with a Wolfson audio chip, which apparently enables a high 113dB signal-to-noise ratio plus a low distortion rate of just 0.002 percent. Like some of the latest Chinese flagship phones, you'll also find Dirac HD codec and a dedicated audio amplifier on the here. On a related subject, the MX3 has a triple-mic setup -- just like the Moto X -- for improved voice quality.. As you'd expect, this new phone comes with a common bundle of radios: NFC, dual-band WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS. CEO Bai Yongxiang, previously a lead engineer at the company, also boasted the MX3's patented antenna technology that enables much better cellular reception than the iPhone 5, while at the same time keeping the specific absorption rate lower than said competitor. For those wondering, the MX3 will be launched with WCDMA radio, meaning its 3G connection will work in most parts of the world.. With so many goodies included, Meizu thinks the 2,400mAh Sony cell can still provide 9 hours of 3G browsing, 10 on Wi-Fi or 7 hours of 1080p video playback. The CEO also assured the audience that the phone has much improved heat dissipation, crediting a dual-layer design to separate CPU heat and display heat. Of course, only time will tell if this is as good as it sounds.. Last but not least, MX3 comes with Flyme 3.0, Meizu's latest custom Android ROM. We won't name all the improvements, but there are a total of 324 updated interaction features (like pull-down to refresh, plus self-repositioning soft keys that adapt to your finger habits), 1,579 updated visual features (like cleaner icons and optimized notification bar layout), an AirDrop-like file-sharing feature and new camera filters. Oh, and China-based users can enjoy the Duomi music store, LeTV video store and Lakala payment service straight out of the box. We'll dig into these in our eventual review.. There's no word on international availability just yet, but for those who are based in China, you can now make a reservation and then pick up an MX3 starting from the second half of September. The price goes from CNÂ¥2,499 (about US$410) for the 16GB model, all the way up to CNÂ¥3,999 (US$650) for a whopping 128GB option -- a first for smartphones! Looks like Meizu's got all the right ingredients on paper this time, but we'll have a better idea once we get our hands on the phone.. 5410 , android , BaiYongxiang , china , exynos5octa , Exynos5Octa5410 , meizu , mobilepostcross , mx3 , phone.

CNET tambiÃ©n estÃ¡ disponible en espaÃ±ol.. MX3 has Apple-like Android, style (hands-on). The unlocked Meizu MX3 tweaks Android Jelly Bean with an eye for iOS style and unique controls.. by February 14, 2014 11:17 AM PST. Meizu's exotic MX3 is unlocked and straight out of China. The Meizu MX3 uses an almost Apple-like interface. The back of the MX3 is smooth and slippery. The Meizu MX3's UI looks similar to iOS but is controlled in unique ways. The MX3's camera app has plenty of settings to tweak. If you live in America and have heard of smartphone maker Meizu, frankly, I'd be very surprised. That's because the Beijing-based company historically has only sold its devices in mainland China and Hong Kong. With its third-generation handset the MX3, however, Meizu feels it has what it takes to go global. Indeed the MX3 is sleekly designed, equipped with a respectable list of components, and flaunts a unique user interface all its own.. That said, even when you factor in its ambitious attempts to re-tool Android and nimble camera, with an unlocked price of approximately $465 the MX3 will be a tough sell at least here in the States. This is especially true considering its lack of 4G LTE support, a skill US consumers have come to expect from a premium device.. Meet the Apple-like Meizu MX3 (pictures). The Meizu MX3 has an almost identical look and feel to that of its predecessors the MX2 and MX 4-core. All three phones sport an all-black front, gently curved edges, and a smooth back molded from white plastic. They, MX3 included, remind me of the classic iPhone 3G and perhaps a Samsung Galaxy S4 or HTC Evo 4G LTE (complete with chrome trim around the edges).. Size-wise, the MX3 is just a hair wider than the Nexus 5 and noticeably bigger than the Motorola Moto X when placed side-by-side. Even the thicker chassis of the Moto X is more compact. Despite that, the MX3 shares practically the same weight of these other devices, about 5 ounces. Oddly enough I found that the MX3 feels lighter in the hand, perhaps because its mass is flatter and spread out over a greater surface area.. Part of the reason the MX3 has a wider stance is its large 5.1-inch LCD screen. It uses an odd resolution (1,800x1,080) but pumps out an adequate amount of light and doesn't distort greatly when viewed off angle. Even so, the MX3 can't match the brightness of the Nexus 5 which is on the dark side as modern phone screens go.. I'm also not a big fan of the MX3's back plate which like the Samsung Galaxy S4 is slippery and attracts grease and fingerprints easily. I much prefer soft-touch coatings or metallic materials flaunted by, say, the Nexus 5 , Moto X , and HTC One. You won't find any hidden treasures under the back panel either, just a SIM card slot and 2,400mAh embedded battery.. The only physical buttons on the Meizu MX3 are a trim volume bar on the phone's left edge, power button up top, and circular capacitive key right below the screen. The typical Android software symbols for back, home, and recent apps aren't here either.. Instead the MX3 leverages a circular capacitive key that sits below the screen to enhance device operation and to interact with the phone's heavily tweaked version of Android Jelly Bean. Called Flyme OS, the custom skin the MX3 runs looks suspiciously similar to Apple's iOS complete with side-scrolling home screens which double as the app tray. In fact there's no standard Android app drawer at all and even the device's settings are placed (a la iPhone) on the main home screen.. So what interesting UI tricks are possible with the MX3's home key? Quite a lot actually. Specifically you can long press it to put the phone to sleep and hold then drag it upward to unlock the phone.. Additionally, sliding up from the bottom of the screen (on either side of the button) pulls up which apps are running in the background. Sliding an app icon upward here closes its associated application. Dragging an icon down closes out of everything currently running. Also, touching the key then sliding up serves as an alternative to a back button.. I can say these are interesting, and admittedly useful, abilities but as a veteran Android user I find the Flyme UI takes some time getting used to. It's so different from its stock Jelly Bean (Android 4.2) software it's almost like learning another OS completely.. Running the show behind the scenes is what Meizu calls a Smart 8-core CPU. Essentially it's based around Samsung's Exynos Octo solution that combines four 1.6GHz Cortex A15 processors with that of four Cortex A7 processors on a single chip. That's backed up by 2GB of RAM and either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage.. Despite all its cores the MX3 has to lean on though I didn't find the handset especially fast. As a matter of fact, it felt decidedly sluggish, with noticeable delays when jumping through settings menus and launching apps. A quick run of the Quadrant benchmark seemed to confirm my impression of the MX3's pokey handling. The device scored 8,341 on the mobile benchmark, lower than the HTC One (12,194) and Galaxy S4 (11,381), both of which are due to be replaced by newer models soon.. One aspect of the Meizu MX3 I like is its 8-megapixel camera. While I haven't fully taken the phone's picture-taking abilities for a definitive spin, I can report that it nabs images quickly. Shot-to-shot time is practically non-existent with the MX3 moving from image to image almost instantly.. The camera app is also stuffed with options, shooting modes, and filters to tweak your photos. For instance there's an HDR mode, Panorama, manual controls for White Balance and ISO, plus an Exposure Compensation setting.. Meizu representatives I spoke to recently confessed the company's strong desire to break into the US mobile phone market. But while the capabilities of the Meizu MX3 have left me with a positive impression, many of its quirks are off-putting. Specifically these are its sluggish handling and glossy, grease-prone design. The phone's distinctly iOS-style Android skin isn't my cup of tea either.. The gadget's $465 unlocked price is tough to swallow as well, especially with excellent (and cheaper) alternatives such as the Nexus 5 (starting at $349) and the Moto G ($179)..

Phones from Chinese manufacturers are slowly coming to the west â and at pretty affordable packages. Though perhaps not entirely new at this point, Meizuâs latest flagship phone made us turn our heads â for more than a few reasons.. Plenty of you have pointed out what seems to be the MX3âs source of inspiration â the iPhone and iOS â but all in all the result is still a very attractive phone, inside and out. Featuring a remarkably thin bezel, the. black front is interrupted only by a small white circle at the bottom, which works as the home button. Somewhat impressive, Meizu managed to fit a large 5.1 inch display in a very tight form factor, that fits very nicely in the hand.. The rest of the layout puts the volume rocker on the left side and the power button up top â this button layout is not too common in the Android space and took a bit of adaption coming from more popular button layouts. That being said, itâs certainly not that foreign, and you do get used to it quickly.. Coming around the back, we have glossy plastic that can come in a number of different colors, which is a nice touch. As we know, people love customizing their devices, and Meizu was wise to offer this. On the rear of the device, a subtle but very appreciated curve helps with the handling and assists in the ergonomics of the device. In short, itâs very nice to hold this phone.. Holding it all together is a magnesium alloy back panel that is supposed to help with heat management and cooling, and the frame is of stainless steel â all of which actually donât make for a very heavy phone by any means, which is a feat of design and engineering, so again, Meizu is to be commended here.. Ok â weâll just say it now â yes, it looks like an iPhone. Achieving striking similarity to what an iPhone 3GS would look like with a large screen, itâs a beautiful, timeless design thatâs likely to draw the ires of Appleâs brilliant legal team, but thatâs not for us to discuss here. We would even go as far as to say itâs âsexy,â with itâs voluptuous curves and form, it slides into your hand and begs to you to grace with playful flicks and gestures. Of all of the devices weâve seen of late, this one leaves something of an impression in that we wish more OEMs in the Android space would design phones that simply looked this good. As always, competition is great, and weâre very happy to see such a nice looking device in the Android space.. Thinnest bezels on the block: Meizu MX3 vs LG G2. Somewhat oddly, Meizu opted for a. 5.1 inch display that actually comes in at a pretty unique 1800Ã1080 resolution at 412ppi. Itâs certainly a strong performer, exhibiting excellent viewing angles, and great brightness, clarity, and uniformity of color throughout.. Also â just so we are perfectly clear â the resolution of the display does not mean that video viewing on the MX3 has a letterbox effect, with black bars on the top and bottom of the content.. Otherwise, color looks really awesome coming from this LCD and the viewing angles are great. The Flyme OS, with its flat design elements, and this screen make for a wonderful combination thatâs likely to delight.. Todayâs top performers | Infographics. Speedy, responsive operation is definitely no problem for the MX3, as Samsungâs own Exynos 5 Octa brings 8 cores of power to the Meizu flagship, backed by PowerVR SGX graphics and 2GB of RAM. Itâs a great combination, and while it might not be as speedy (or power efficient) as Qualcommâs own Snapdragon line of SoCs, it still delivers where it counts: real world performance, multitasking, robust web browsing, and camera operation.. Multitasking posed no real problems to speak of; granted, I will admit that multitasking in Flyme is probably a little too simplistic. Given that the Flyme operating system is a pretty different OS with many elements built specifically by Meizu, itâs very possible that optimizations help provide for what is a very smooth experience. But we also know too that the underlying hardware is very powerful, even by modern standards.. While it might not have expandable storage, it is possible to get the MX3 with up to 128 GB onboard. Weâd like to see more manufacturers offer devices with this much on-board memory. Really, itâs only an extra $5 towards the BOM (build of materials) and Meizu hasnât cut corners with this device.. This version of the MX3 keeps to HSDPA connectivity, so there was no high speed internet to be had â hopefully weâll see LTE in the western versions.. Sound quality in calls was standardly good, with no dropped calls in our testing to speak of.. A 2,400 mAh battery, while seemingly enough, is starting to feel a bit ill equipped these days when compared to more girthy batteries of the Galaxy S4 (2,600 mAh), LG G2 (3,000 mAh), yet remains better than the HTC One, with its substandard 2,300 mAh battery. Increasingly, we are seeing that itâs more than the sum of parts for devices that have been released over the past 6 months. Take the Moto X and G for example â they feature near best in class battery life, and itâs more to do with the tight integration of hardware and software fused together in beautiful harmony.. Getting back to the Meizu MX3âs battery â it is. a little small in capacity and, somewhat unfortunately, real world usage supports this. Despite the Octa-core power consumption features, optimization was lacking and thus my testing of the battery drained it in around 8 hours. With power savings on, you are able to eek a bit more out of it, but itâs still nowhere near what we would have liked it to be.. Oh, and that magnesium alloy panel for cooling? I still notice that under heavy load the phone gets really warm. I will say that it doesnât seem to linger very long, so there is certainly success there.. For those that have been paying attention to the modern smartphone economy the real story here is the audio output, as the MX3 is outfitted with a Wolfson audio chip for better audio processing and a speaker system that, while it does look pretty meek, is supposed to blast. And it does, providing quite a bit of dimension in the sound, making the MX3 perhaps rival even the HTC One, depending on what your ears prefer. Wolfson makes some of finest audio system in the world, and is not found on as many devices today.. The Meizu MX3 camera is an 8 MP shooter, with a f/2.0 aperture for lower light shots. The camera boasts of a few interesting features, but overall, the camera app is pretty simplistic, with all the elements and options on one side, which do include some options for creativity and some manual controls, in the menu.. One of the cool features of the camera is Gesture Capturing, which allows you to wave your hand over the proximity sensor to fire the shutter, which makes taking a picture that much easier. While the camera is far from perfect, it is a capable performer, and definitely fun to use, especially via gestures.. Picture quality is hit and miss, although a hit for the most part. Colors do look good and arenât dull, and details come through quite well. That being said, the general noise level is still quite high, even though weâve seen worse, and you may get overexposed shots more often than youâd prefer. Auto-focusing wasnât particularly âautoâ either, as I had to touch to focus more often than not, but thankfully, the focus speed is pretty high.. The design aesthetics arenât the only thing that feature similarities to the iPhone. Flyme OS is a bit of a mashup â yes, iOS 7 elements come to the flat design which is then put on top of an Android base, and makes for a gesture heavy interface.. Having just a home button does simplify things, but the other buttons are softkeys. The good thing is that Flyme brilliantly consolidates them in a thin black bar at the very bottom of the screen, and not once did I see a breakage in the buttons via this bar.. Gestures center around that home button. Swiping up away from the home button brings up the very simple line of recent apps for multitasking, and a swipe down emulates a back button, or can be used to easily wake the phone.. As for the general interface, the flat design comes with many unique ways of expressing otherwise familiar elements of Android â the volume indicator is very understated now, the notification drop down only comes down as far as it needs to display notifications, and the settings area is a long line down of tabs. Simplification done right is always welcomed by us here at Android Authority, but unfortunately, in this case, it does come at the cost of some function. Mainly, itâs the multitasking â it is just way too simple, with it being just swipe ups and selections, without even a preview of those apps.. Simplification also meant doing with the app drawer completely, making literally all apps and widgets on the homescreens. While this might take some getting used to (unless youâre switching over from an iPhone), making folders help, and the good design of the OS does keep things from looking cluttered or unattractive.. Worst case scenario, just install a custom launcher â but all in all, the Flyme OS is another example of the attractiveness of this device.. Meizu told us that they are looking to bring the MX3 to western markets, but until then, it is possible to get this phone for under $500, a price point that is still better than many other flagship devices out there.. âMade in China.â A term that is unfortunately saddled with a negative connotation in regards to quality â however, in the smartphone space, companies are making moves to reverse this notion. With offerings like the MX3, we think they are succeeding â and we are very excited to see them continue to come stateside.. Let us know what you think of the Meizu MX3!.

What's good Speedy performance Sharp display with uniform colors Classic design Up to 128GB of onboard storage. What's bad Poor auto-focus feature Non-removable battery. The MX3 is Meizu's third flagship smartphone in their lineup. Design-wise the MX3 is very similar to the iPhone 3GS with its rounded corners and what experts call a timeless appeal. Unlike the iPhone though, you can remove replace the back case with a different color for customization. Surprisingly, the 2,400mAh battery is not removable, which left many critics confused. Giz China comments, "â¦this is the first phone I have ever reviewed which has a non-removable battery despite a removable panel.". The most noticeable difference is the 5.1-inch FHD display. The display offers a stunning 1800 x 1080 pixel resolution, which translates to 412ppi pixel density. Critics commend the clarity of the screen as well as the viewing angles and color uniformity. While a 5.1-inch display might not be large, the thin 2.90mm bezels give reviewers the impression that the screen is much larger than its actual measurements.. For a smooth performance, Meizu opted for an 8-CPU-core Exynos 5 processor that comes with 4 1.6GHz cores and 4 1.2GHz cores. Despite having 8 cores, benchmark tests rank the Exynos processor below the HTC One M8 and Samsung Galaxy S5, both of which use Qualcomm's Snapdragon quad-core processors. When performing real world tests, Android Authority found that it delivered incredibly fast performance without any noticeable lags when browsing the interface and multitasking. They mention, however, that, "multitaskingâ¦is probably a little too simplisticâ¦it's very possible that optimizations help provide for what is a very smooth experience." On top of the speedy processor the MX3 is the first smartphone to offer up to 128GB of onboard storage.. Perhaps the one disappointment for critics was the 8MP rear camera. While they describe the color quality as "good" they also note that details themselves were not very clear. In addition, they add that noise levels were also very high and that the auto-focus feature was not very auto.. For the most part, reviewers would recommend the Meizu MX3 despite the shortcomings of its camera. Slashgear states, "Meizu continues to impress with their latest smartphone entryâ¦". "Made in China." A term that is unfortunately saddled with a negative connotation in regards to quality â however, in the smartphone space, companies are making moves to reverse this notion.

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. Chris Burns - Jan 22, 2014. With the release of the Meizu MX3, the company once again aims high with their ability to create a high-end device that, at first, looks like itâd be able to compete with the finer solutions by the top manufacturers in the USA. What weâve got here instead â in this current international edition of the device â is a machine thatâll be able to compete with brands in China and surrounding markets with a look thatâs smooth, abilities that are quite nice, and Android 4.2-based Flyme OS 3.0 â read: rather unique.. Meizu brins some heat with a 1800 x 1080 pixel 5.1-inch display â entirely unique in the United Statesâ collection of smartphones today, to be sure. Thatâs a cool 415PPI (pixels per inch) with LCD technology to light this screen up bright â and with a 2.90mm bezel (thatâs incredibly small), it would appear that youâve got a display in your hands with next to nothing to the left or right of it.. Under the hood youâve got an 8-CPU-core Samsung-made Exynos 5 processor â coming with 4x A15 cores clocked at 1.6GHz as well as 4x A7 cores clocked at 1.2GHz. This is all manufactured with 28nm architecture â and if youâre wondering what youâre going to do with all of these cores, weâre right along with you.. When 2 core processors were revealed for smartphones, we understood that weâd be able to offload processes to be able to do more than one thing at a time. With quad-core processing, the case was bumped again â with NVIDIAâs solution we even had a fifth âninjaâ core that allowed us to send low-power processor needs out for low-power processing â now weâre up to 8 cores. What could we possibly want with so many cores?. As it turns out, weâve at least got one reason to roll â lots of power for benchmarks. While weâre seeing little in the way of Meizuâs own utilization of all of these cores directly, it would seem that the company has successfully created one rather powerful phone. Now we just need more developers to step up and take the power for their own.. Below youâll find a number of benchmark test results for the Meizu MX3 â note that not all benchmarks take all processor cores into consideration, while youâll find the Meizu MX3 out-performing essentially every device on the market today when all cores are considered.. Also under the hood youâve got some PowerVR SGX architecture at 544MP3 (3-core MHz) as well for graphics processing prowess. Meizu does appear to be rolling smart with these cores as weâve never seen a skip yet in videos weâve watched or Android-based games weâve played.. Connectivity in your own home is provided by 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi sensors, rolling out with speeds as fast or faster than weâve seen on other smart devices with the same abilities. This comes in handy for face-to-face video calling and streaming videos, as you might have guessed.. Youâll also find a rather refreshing set of colored backside covers available for this device, interchangeable so long as you know where to buy them. The standard color is white â thatâs the one youâll get right out of the box.. Meizu continues to impress with their smooth-looking flat aesthetic with Flyme OS 3.0. This version of the operating system based on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean does present some getting used to for hardcore vanilla-Android users, but weâve found the change-over to be enjoyable.. Android users across the board aim to find the ideal aesthetic with 3rd-party launchers from a variety of developers â here Meizuâs implementation of Flyme makes us want to stick with whatâs presented. One example is the fact that thereâs no app drawer â you can use folders to collect what youâd like on one of several homescreens.. The âMâ in the center of the bottom portion of the display is part of the Meizu logo, linking you to the companyâs built-in web browser to the Meizu homepage. This is an element we could do without, but Flyme 3.0 allows us to move it out and replace it with any other app shortcut easily.. Apps such as Documents, Music, and Gallery offer up extreme simplifications of the sometimes-overbearing versions offered with other, larger brands. The designers behind this user interface have syphoned the bits we needed and have tossed out the rest â this is Android at just about itâs most user-friendly.. Youâve got the choice of working with Google Play for apps â like any other USA-based device â and Meizuâs âApp Centerâ, where you may have some trouble navigating unless you speak the dialect. Many apps require you to pay Yen, which in turn requires that you sign up with a Flyme account â not something we were especially excited about since we come into every Android device expecting to use Google Play.. That said, Meizu and Flyme are at a point in their respective histories where we can trust them to provide us with reliable service, top to bottom. It will be interesting to see if this App Center survives the journey to the USA in the USA-based edition(s).. With Google Play there was nary an app we couldnât install, as Meizu has worked this device out to be compatible with the vast majority of Android apps out there in the wild. While weâve had trouble with some international-aimed smartphones and Google Play app compatibility, Meizu has struck the right chord here for the largest cross-section of compatibility weâve seen on such a phone.. This machineâs camera works with what they describe as a âtop-classâ 8-megapixel BSI sensor with f/2.0 âsuper-largeâ aperture. This back-facing setup works with a 77-degree wide-angle lens and the ability to work with 1080p video at 30FPS.. Up front youâve got a 2-megapixel camera with BSI sensor and 1080p video recording abilities at 30FPS. The back-facing camera is also helped with a 4-channel photographic processing chip as well as a Wolfson WM5102 audio decoding chip, speaker chip, and a ânew-generation audio enhancement chipâ.. This is all going deeper into the bits included inside the smartphone than most companies end up speaking about with the public â in the end it just means that this smartphone has had all of its components picked by Meizu by hand to create one solid experience.. Above is a set of photos taken with the Meizu MX3 with the back-facing camera. Below youâll find a video filmed with that same camera.. While weâre not especially keen on testing an international phone here in the USA for call quality in general, here it would seem that Meizu has done the work necessary to provide a positive experience no matter where you go. Weâll be testing the USA-based model(s) again to see how the more locally-aimed phone components fare, but for now youâll be glad to know that this device sounds quite nice from both ends â we heard our callers with fine quality and our callers heard us with great ease.. UPDATE: The AT&T version weâve got here sounds just as fine as the international version weâve had our hands on. Meizu has gone and created a device that sounds as nice as it looks.. The battery on this device stands the test of an average day quite well, especially considering the massively dense display youâre seeing up front. Working with a 2400 mAh lithium-polymer battery inside â even though weâve got heavy-duty 8-core processing going on with high-powered gaming and the lot â has lasted us a full 8-hour workday with ease.. We must assume this is due to Meizuâs implementation of Panel Self Refresh (PSR) technology âbuilt for big screens.â So far this device at least hits the battery time of similar devices, if not beating them in similar tests.. Once you get into heavy usage, youâll find that you may need to charge this device halfway through the day. When youâve got a display this large running at full brightness with a whole lot of activity going on under the hood, there seems to be just no getting out of needing to keep that battery in wall plugs.. Meizu continues to impress with their latest smartphone entry here with the MX3. We were already impressed with the abilities of the Meizu MX all the way back in 2012 â here two generations later, things have only gotten better. While we wouldnât recommend a USA-based consumer to pick this model up specifically due to 3G-only connectivity, once the US-based model(s) start appearing, weâll have a real contender on our hands..

Meizu MX3: Hands-on Video of a Top Chinese Smartphone. Meizuâs MX series of Android smartphones are some of the most popular in China, and in 2014 Meizu is planning to release a new handset in North America. Not content to wait, we had the company sent us its current flagship, the MX3, to inspect.. February 22, 2014 at 6:58 PM. While many people probably still think of Chinese phone manufacturers as producing cheap knock-offs of Western and Korean designs, companies like Meizu, Oppo, and Xiaomi have been making high-quality original handsets for a number of years now. Unfortunately, until recently itâs been hard for North American phone enthusiasts to get their hands on these devices. Oppo was the first vendor to make its products easily accessible to a global audience (we recently reviewed the Oppo Find 5 ), and now Meizu has announced that itâs also coming to North America. We caught up with the company at CES, where its current flagship, the MX3, was on display. While the MX3 wonât be the actual device thatâs formally launching stateside, it is a showcase of what Meizu is capable of building. For North American gadget enthusiasts who really want to own a Meizu now, the company has partnered with a number of online retailers to make the MX3 available over here as well.. The MX3 was originally released in China in October 2013, and this is a modern large-screen Android smartphone in every sense of the word. It has a 5.1-inch IPS 1080p display, and is powered by Samsung's Exynos 5 Octa SoC. The MX3 is also very well made, utilizing plastic, magnesium, and steel in its construction. While itâs not the most powerful Android phone out there, itâs still a very respectable device, and it demonstrates that Meizu is certainly a handset manufacturer for Android enthusiasts to keep a close eye on.. The MX3's Samsung Exynos 5 Octa 5410 SoC implements ARMâs big.LITTLE. processing architecture, and while advertised as an eight-core CPU, the 5410 actually has four Cortex-A15 CPU cores along with four less powerful Cortex-A7 cores. Workloads are divided between cores, with the hopes that less processor-intensive tasks can run on the slower cores, thus saving power. Unfortunately, the GPU used in the Exynos 5 Octa is PowerVRâs three-core SGX 544MP3, which isnât particularly powerful.. The screen of the MX3, however, is quite impressive. The 5.1-inch IPS panel has excellent viewing angles and color reproduction. The panel also sports a unique aspect ratio and screen resolution at 15:9 and 1800x1080 respectively. The side bezel is also incredibly slim at just 2.9 mm (0.11â), making the MX3 nice and compact despite being a five-inch handset.. The MX3 runs Meizuâs own Flyme OS 3.1, which is a heavily customized version of Android 4.2. Like many Chinese ROMs, Flyme OS features no app drawer, but instead houses every app on the homescreens themselves - like in iOS.. Unfortunately, the MX3 does not support LTE, which has become the de facto standard for North American handsets. The fastest speed that the MX3 supports is HSPA+, and although thatâs still plenty fast for most smartphone data use, the bigger issue is the MX3âs lack of supported North American bands. This will definitely affect how usable the MX3 is for North America users, from both a coverage and network performance standpoint.. SoC Samsung Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU Core 4 x ARM Cortex-A15 @ 1.6 GHz 4 x ARM Cortex-A7 @ 1.2 GHz GPU Core Imagination Technologies PowerVR SGX544MP3 (3-core) @ 533 MHz Memory 2 GB DDR3 Display 5.1" 15:9 IPS @ 1800 x 1080 (415 ppi) Battery 2400 mAh (non-removable) Cameras 8 MP Rear, 2 MP Front Bands GSM: 850/900/1800 HSPA+: 850/2100 Software Google Android 4.2.1 Meizu FlymeOS 3.1.1 Price $330 (16 GB), $430 (32 GB) Hands-On First Impressions. The MSRP of the MX3 was recently reduced in China, with the 16 GB model now priced at $330 and the 32 GB variant at $430. Meizuâs official online reseller of the MX3 for global buyers has the 32 GB version on sale for $450 , which is a pretty reasonable price for a phone with the MX3âs specs.. We'll cover the MX3's hardware design, screen, and hardware specs in the first part of our hands-on video.. In part two, we cover the camera and Flyme OS.. You can see recent and comprehensive results of how the MX3 performs in GFXBench 3.0: A Fresh Look At Mobile Benchmarking .. Meizu has created a pretty impressive piece of hardware. While the MX3 is not the most powerful phone on the market, the performance deficit between it and newer handsets isnât that noticeable during typical daily use. The design and build quality is as good as any of the familiar players in the Android space, and the 5.1-inch screen is simply gorgeous.. But despite all the positives and great price, the bottom line is that we wouldnât recommend anyone in North America buy the MX3, simply for one reason: connectivity. Without LTE support, and with only one HSPA+ band being compatible with North American carriers, youâd probably be in for quite a bit of heartache if your carrierâs 850 MHz band isn't the best.. That said, the one takeaway we have from our time with the MX3 is that we canât wait to see what Meizu has in store for with the MX4, which is to be designed with the North American market in mind. If the company can produce a smartphone with the same build quality and a similar design as the MX3, but with newer, more powerful silicon inside, LTE support, and still manage to sell it unlocked at a competitive price, Meizu could have a real winner on its hands..

Why not MTk, they cost like 10x less while offering more or less the same thing?. i love it how all the high rez smartphones use IPS tech....Steve Jobs said that oled was dead tech....nice very nice. Wtf that phone is more overall powerfull than my motherÂ´s pc LOL. Wait for them sharp igzo screens to be used...ips will finally be bested.. The MTK offers 8 relatively weak A7 cores, while this has 4 of those and 4 badass a15 cores.. Eynos? Why not MTk, they cost like 10x less while offering more or less the same thing?. Here it is, american know-how exported overseas and they sell it back to us. The USA does not have enough graduates and enough jobs for the graduates. Some of the Exynos chips are pretty nice. This one is kind of half and half. The CPU side is pretty decent. But they're still using Series 5 PowerVR chips, and only a 3 core at that! The Series 6 cores are MUCH better. On top of that, the Android 4.2 derived OS will drag it down compared to an otherwise identical device with 4.4. I'm not entirely against Android forks but I'd want stock Android on a smartphone over any fork or even custom UI. Also, Google hates forks and has moved a lot of their code away from core semi-open-source Android into closed source "apps and services", which harms forks in general. But to me that's ridiculous, if you didn't want forks, don't pretend you're all pro open source in the first place!. Mmmmh rounded edges, round home button... Apple's lawyers better start learning chinese :-D. Is anyone else wondering why they you can't remove the battery?. GFXBench 3.0: A Fresh Look At Mobile Benchmarking.

For some time now I have the Meizu MX3 phone and I would be very happy if I can share my thoughts and my personal opinion about this really unique device. Meizu is very known company from before. So I think I don't need to write anything about them. About packaging except the MX3 you get also the USB cable and charger. All accessories are in white color. I must admit because the packaging was very smart and cool packed, legal different from other. Meizu MX3 is 1st smart phone in the world which has edge-to-edge design. In other words it means it almost without bezel or to be precise edges are very thin. So this is very cool because of that the device can be smaller with bigger screens. The phone is completely made of plastic, the build quality is high. The front side is completely protected with gorilla glass 3 and the back cover has hyperglaze finish. In my personal opinion the phone is really cute and I think you will also agree with me on this. Meizu MX3 has 5.1 inch display. Display has resolution 1080 x 1800 pixels. The screen is very sharp and it has enough strong brightness including viewing angles. In this combination the screen gives about 412 ppi what I believe is really impressive. AsI said in the beginning the screen is also protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 with Native Damage Resistance technology. So in my opinion the screen in one word is perfect. Alt.the MX3 is not the newest model it is still a good device these days. Because it has very powerful hardware under the hood like Exynos 5 Octa 5410 chipset with 2 GB of RAM and for graphics PowerVR SGX544MP3. From this you can see that this hardware is strong and in 99.9% you will be able to do anything you want to do. For example you can play any game you want if you like gaming also as an average user you can go to the Internet, check your mail or listen to the radio. I have also tested the device with several benchmark test applications and below you can see the results. If you love to photograph then the Meizu MX3 is good choice because it has good quality camera. It has 8 megapixel camera with led flash. I photographed in several different conditions and in my opinion photos are good. Of course there are phones with better camera but if you are not to the mending then you don't need to worry about it. Also below you can see photo examples. According to this blog GPS works out of box. You don't need to do any modifications and GPS does not need Wi-Fi or network help. I am telling you this because many Chinese smartphones has GPS problems because of bad antenna or something else. It has built in battery with capacity of 2400mAh. According to the Meizu it gives autonomy of 400 hours in standby mode with 2G connection and about 385 hours with 3G connection. As conclusion I can say that Meizu MX3 is still good device with many good features. It has high build quality, really nice design, strong hardware, good camera and many other things.
