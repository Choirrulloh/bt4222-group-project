Microsoft Lumia 640 XL LTE Dual SIM - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 45 46 ». I'm going to buy a small smartphone... it hase "?Best antenna signal" and "best voice quality"..... - lumia 640 xl (lte-dual sim)--. Which one to choose??? or models and other brands??. Because of the authentic tests, these three phones have the best antenna.. i want one smartphone with small screen but best signal 2G and 4G antenna. i work in basement and 4g is very very week...,/ too 2g is week and call is disconnected and connected, and my voice does not go to the receiver.. please help me too choose best small smartphone for best antenna signal call quality... Not sure why all the bad opinions on this phone, I love mine. the OS is a breeze, the tiles are way better than the icon based IOS/Droid. Syncs with my Win10 PCs at work and home, free cloud backup for pics/videos, 128 gb expandable SD lets you install apps and use like an expandable hard drive (many droid devices do not). never notices the app shortage, plenty of games, links to my Xbox live and my Xbox One console, I can access my Xbox One console from phone, easy set up of multiple email addresses including my work and Gmail accounts. setting up my email account was easiest I've ever experienced. awesome intuitive OS with its original tile based system and the highly customizable options puts your generic hard to find, easy to accidentally move icon based OS options to shame. Because its so different than the same old same old and I have it customized it looks great, people come up to my and want to know what kind of phone it is. has Microsoft work, excel, power point + so much more already installed. free upgrade and ongoing support for windows mobile. fraction of the cost of the competition. not a flag ship model but awesome value, takes good pics. paid less than $65.00 with shipping for open box model over a year ago, holds up very nice still looks great. I can load any apps, setting or options I want and edit the tile size to access everything I use with just a quick tap of a finger. IF on a budget the Lumia 640XL is much better buy than competition. Just 6 months of use, I can't access my store anymore. message on screen reads 'something bad happen, unknown layout specified in manifest'. Please, how can I get my store back?. Horrible, as user i fell abandoned by microsoft, im getting other phone asap or try to instal.android on it which looks bit impossible,.

Hi, suddenly internet explorer options gone from my fone, anybody facing similar issues, pls help as not able to access any site. Really bad phone, you will regret spending money, the OS is verry unstable,and social apps are not working from time to time.. Constantly freezes now with facebook, messenger, and Microsoft edge, with latest updates.. Been using Windows Phones off and on. Moving up to 950xl for the 3gb ram. Unfortunately social apps recommend 2gb and it runs slow on only 1gb ram.. Awesome fone, great speed, stable OS. I bought 640XL LTE Dual Sim back in October 2015. I was kinda die hard fan of Windows Phone because I was bored with Android and kinda annoyed Android's sluggishness. Was using Android on various devices for about 4 yrs. Realized after every update Android became slow. On the other hand, I had development experience on Microsoft Platform (.NET, C#, VB). So thought of picking up one solid Windows Phone device would be helpful. Well no doubt that this particular device is a solid one. It had good camera, great battery life (really good backup), relatively big screen, etc (Although not AMOLED but was good enough). Came with Windows Phone 8.1 out of of the box. This OS was way better than any previous Windows Mobile / Phone. I liked most parts of Windows Phone and best part of all, no hanging or sluggishness like Android. Although only 1GB RM, Windows Phone tackle it well. That's why don't ever directly compare phones with different OS nature, like Apple, Android and Microsoft. Windows Phone's memory handling mechanism is unique such that 1GB RAM was sufficient back then. The biggest problem for me and i suppose for everyone is app availability. It really sucked to the max. The only good and stable apps were like WhatsApp and Instagram. Instagram was in BETA quite long but it is is finally out. Instagram was really feature rich and mostly stable but occasionally crashes. FB app has never EVER been stable on Windows Phone. Back in Windows Phone 8.1, FB app had update issue..Was showing up old stories in news feed no matter how many time we update. After Windows 10 Mobile came, became more interesting. I updated mine and my device was still smooth (no crashing or sluggishness like some complain). FB app improved but still sucked. Built-in Photos App only improved a little on Windows 10. I had so much of private files in my phone especially porn and there were almost zero 3rd party app that can lock my files or something. This is largely because of Windows's architecture. Every app is sandboxed, therefore individual app locking could not be achieved. Unless you have very special needs or super duper bored with iOS and Android, then don't get Windows handsets. They are quite left behind and need to catch up really a lot, especially on the app support part..

Information about some specific features related to the SIM card(s) of the device.. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) was developed to replace the analog cellular network (1G), therefore it is referred to as a 2G mobile network. It has been improved with the addition of General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and later via the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology.. UMTS stands for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System. Based on the GSM standard, it is deemed as a 3G mobile network standard. It has been developed by the 3GPP and its major advantage is the provision of greater bandwidth and spectral efficiency, due to the W-CDMA technology.. LTE is deemed to be the fourth generation (4G) of mobile communications technology. It has been developed by the 3GPP based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies in order to increase the speed and capacity of wireless data networks. A further development of the technology is called LTE Advanced.. There are several network technologies that enhance the performance of mobile networks mainly by increased data bandwidth. Information about the communication technologies supported by the device and their respective uplink and downlink bandwidth.. Information about the operating system used by the device as well as its version.. Name and version of the user interface (UI) used by the operating system (OS).. The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. Similar to the CPU, the GPU consists of processing units called cores. They handle the computation of graphics in various applications.. The frequency is the clock rate of the graphic processor (GPU), which is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. RAM (Random-Access Memory) is used by the operating system and all installed applications. Data in the RAM is lost after the device is turned off or restarted.. Information about the capacity of the built-in storage of the device. Sometimes one and the same model may is offered in variants with different internal storage capacity.. The various types of memory cards are characterized by different sizes and capacity. Information about the supported types of memory cards.. One of the main characteristics of the display is its type/technology, on which depends its performance.. In mobile devices display size is represented by the length of its diagonal measured in inches.. The ratio between the long and the short side of the display. The display resolution shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical side of the screen. The higher the resolution is, the greater the detail of the displayed content.. Information about the number of pixels per centimeter (ppcm) or per inch (ppi) of the display. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed and clearer is the information displayed on the screen.. The color depth of the display is also known as bit depth. It shows the number of bits used for the color components of one pixel. Information about the maximum number of colors the screen can display.. The estimated percentage of the screen area from the device's front area.. Information about other functions and features of the display.. Sensors vary in type and purpose. They increase the overall functionality of the device, in which they are integrated.. Digital cameras use image sensors for taking photos. The sensor characteristics are some of the main factors determining the quality of the camera integrated in the mobile device.. Information about the dimensions of the image sensor used in the device. Usually cameras with larger sensors and less pixel density tend to provide better image quality despite the lower resolution.. A smaller pixel size allows the image sensor to use more pixels thus providing better image resolution. On the other hand, this may negatively impact noise levels and decrease image quality at high ISO settings.. Crop factor is the ratio of the dimensions of a full frame camera's sensor (36 x 24 mm, which equals the frame size of a 35 mm film) and the dimensions of the image sensor of the device. The number shown is the ratio between the diagonals of a full frame sensor (43.3 mm) and the device sensor.. Aperture (f-stop number) indicates the size of the lens diaphragm opening, which controls the amount of light reaching the image sensor. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the diaphragm opening is.. Focal length is the distance in millimeters from the focal point of the image sensor to the optical center of the lens. A focal length, which results in the same field of view on a full-frame (35 mm) camera, is also provided.. Cameras of mobile devices use mainly a LED or a Xenon flash. The LED flash has a softer burst of light and in contrast to the much brighter Xenon flash, is used for recording videos as well.. One of the main characteristics of the cameras of mobile devices is their resolution, which shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the image.. Information about the maximum resolution available for shooting a video with the device.. Information about the maximum number of frames per second (fps), supported by the device while recording a video at maximum resolution.
