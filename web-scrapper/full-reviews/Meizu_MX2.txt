Author Bharadwaj Chandramouli Posted on August 14, 2013 August 24, 2013 Categories Android , China , Featured , Reviews. The first words that usually come to our mind at the mention of a Chinese phone are cheap, unreliable and poorly built. But it didnât take long to see that these are plain misconceptions, especially with devices like the Oppo Find 5. The Meizu MX2 invoked similar reactions from us, as we were starting to use and test this gorgeous device. As a company that has been widely known for making iPhone clones like the M8, the Meizu MX was a refreshing change and a departure from the cloning legacy, and the MX2 is an improvement upon its predecessor in good measure. So, how good is the Meizu MX2? Read on to find out.. Note â Check out our unboxing post for the video of the box contents.. The design of the Meizu MX2 is simple and minimalistic. Boasting super thin bezels and a laminated display, the device looks slick. Youâd be hard pressed to not say this resembles an Apple device, because it definitely does, especially with a round capacitive touch button and the super thin 3.15mm bezel, reminding us a lot of the iPod Touch.. A single piece of glass completely envelopes the front with a small cut out for the grilled ear piece. The 720p front facing camera along with the proximity and ambient light sensors are neatly hidden under the glass, above the display.. Below the display resides the single home button, which is capacitive and fluorescent, with feedback in light as well as haptics. It also works as a way to wake or lock the phone, making the power button on the top redundant. A double tap wakes the phone in standby and opens the multitasking tray when in the UI. A tap and hold locks the phone when the device is in use.. Itâs also worth noting that these gestures work only when the proximity sensor believes itâs not in your pants, pretty intuitive, and we loved the way it made the power button irrelevant, while glowing in the dark at the same time. As a bonus, the home button also works as the notification light, but with a breathing single coloured light, really cool nevertheless.. While the front is made of glass, the sides tell you that the device is made of three layers. The top layer in black is metal and acts as a frame. This, along with another layer of brushed metal that treads along the sides make up the rim of the MX2, and it does look really classy. Beneath the metal lies the high quality plastic that encompasses the remaining sides and the back of the device, with controls and components embedded on them.. The left side houses the volume rocker, which has a single piece translucent button. This is due to the Dual Injection moulding of the back case, which makes it really special. Like the Lumia 620, the outer layer is a clear layer while the inner is opaque. This makes for an interesting aesthetic addition.. It is especially visible near the 3.5mm audio jack on the top, that sits alongside a secondary microphone and the similarly translucent power/lock switch. Also, if you keenly notice, there is a small part of the top that is not metal, and that part is actually a segment of the antenna. It improves the network performance, presumably because metal gets in the way. We can confirm that there is no death grip situation here, but it certainly impacts negatively on the signal when you cover that part with your hand. Shouldnât be a problem in real life scenarios though.. The left side of the phone also has the small hole which is used to pry open the back cover. Opening the back cover is extremely hard and you need the special in-box tool to do it, doesnât make it any easier. You almost always have the impression of breaking the back cover, but itâs solid and we wished Meizu could have done something different here.. Underneath the back cover, you have an all-metal construction with shielding from electromagnetic waves and static electricity, which Meizu says, is one of a kind. On the top of the back resides the 8 megapixel camera unit with the single LED flash stuck on to the back cover rather than on the device.. You have the loudspeaker down at the bottom right and the micro SIM card slot at the left.. The back is made of plastic and is nicely curved to fit your hands and thanks to the overall compactness of the phone, the phone is a pleasure to hold. The one handed usage was fairly easier than most other phones at this point in time, and thatâs a laudable fact. Easily one of the most comfortable devices we have recently used or tested.. Finally, the right side of the phone is left flush while the bottom part houses the USB port and the primary microphone for voice calls. Onto finer details of the hardware then.. The Meizu MX2 has a 4.44 inch 1280Ã800 16:10 IPS LCD screen that is, laminated using the TOL technology. Basically, it means that it is bonded to the touchscreen like many other displays these days, but the result is stunning. Meizu claims that this is a new surface lamination technique that vastly improves the colour balance and the viewing angles of the display and we tend to wholeheartedly agree, because the display is definitely nothing short of stunning in every aspect we have tested.. The display holds its ground in every viewing angle possible and has excellent outdoor visibility thanks to the perfect ambient light sensor. Meizu also claims that their CABC â Content adaptive brightness control helps in improving the battery life. While we couldnât actually test its existence, we did feel that the sensor selective ramps up/down the brightness according to the apps. The camera app always had optimal brightness and made outdoor shooting very comfortable. The 347 ppi screen was very crisp and rendered the beautiful UI to perfection.The blacks are not as deep as youâd expect, but for a LCD, it is very good. The brightness is more than adequate and performs really well outdoors.. At close inspection though, you will be able to notice some banding in the display which might be due to the refresh rate, but that aside, this is easily one of the best displays we have ever used. Right along with the iPhone 5, the Oppo Find 5 and the HTC One, the Meizu MX2 possibly ranks as one of the best displays ever made, for a smartphone. But as with any product or a component, there is a downside, which only varies in intensity. The display backlight slightly bleeds at the edges when viewed at extreme angles. While this is not a major issue and does not affect usage in any way, it is a sign of a fumble in quality.. The camera on the Meizu MX2 is a 8 megapixel unit with a backside illuminated sensor and a single LED flash. Amongst the 5 elements of the lens, there is a blue filter coating on four, preventing infrared interferences for a clearer picture. The lens also has a sufficiently fast f2.4 aperture. Sporting two microphones, the MX2 can record full HD 1080p videos at 30 fps with stereo audio.. The main point of interaction with the camera is its minimalistic user interface. You have a shutter button on the right which changes according to the mode and can be switched using the small switch above the shutter. Below the software shutter button is the thumbnail of the latest image that takes you to the gallery upon a click. Over at the top left you have the options to switch between the two cameras and a toggle for the flash at the bottom left. The contextual menu opens up different options for stills and videos.. You can change between the capture modes like Normal, Panorama(four way, high resolution), smile shot and burst shot. You can then change the ISO upto 800 or set it to auto, change the scene modes accordingly or set it to auto and also change the white balance. The âOtherâ menu reveals options for geotagging, wide dynamic range capture, gesture capture and various resolution image sizes. While this is all applicable for stills, you get limited options for video which includes just video size, scene and white balance.. Talking of the camera performance, the results are very mixed. The MX2 takes amazingly detailed photos and disappointingly soft photos at the same time, itâs simply a superb yet unreliable camera. Since the sensor is small, the over aggressive metering spoils shots with bright backgrounds by either underexposing or overexposing it, so we resorted to using the âWide Dynamic Rangeâ mode a lot. On that note, lets take a look at the camera samples now.. As you can see above, some of the photos have really awesome detail even at 100%, but some photos are disappointingly soft and defocused. We wish we could have answers to this problem, but the only thing we can say is, may be the post processing algorithm or the lens is doing the damage. We also have our doubts on the WDR mode, as most photos taken with that mode turn out softer than the normal. This is very much evident in the excellent macro pics that the MX2 snapped â. If you closely look at the macro photos above, youâd be really surprised to see that the snaps have not a trace of noise even at 100%, which is mind blowing for a camera, on a phone. The likes of 808 and the Lumia 1020 are obviously better due to oversampling, but getting this amount of detail in a clean snap is rather really surprising. Do note that all the photos above are taken with WDR off, as macro shots were a bane of that mode and results were completely unusable. While some WDR shots have come out extremely well, some are too soft and unreliable. But it is good to note that unlike other cameras, the WDR mode on this camera takes bracketed shots really fast without much of a shake, good in that aspect.. In low light though, the camera struggles to capture photos without noise. The ISO is way too high always and we canât really do anything about it, strictly speaking. Lowering the ISO doesnât help the low light situation and the single LED flash is of not much use either. As you can see above, the shake and noise were two inevitable things that crept into every low light photo we took. The last one was a low light scene that we tried with the WDR mode, but that turned out to be the softest image we have ever seen from the device. We think the noise reduction is so harsh, it completely softens the pic, and thatâs the case with the other WDR photos above too. The device can also take sweep panorama shots in both horizontal as well as vertical orientations. Here is a horizontal sample, in low light and in a high resolution. The height or width, depending on the orientation, always stays at 1088, which is pretty nice for a panorama.. This shot has no discrepancies at all, which is quite nice as it is a sweep panorama unlike a step-by-step method other apps follow. So, overall when it comes to stills performance, the Meizu MX2 is a mixed bag, with excellent results and softened pics at the same time. If it is a software issue, Meizu should look at fixing this, as the camera hardware proves to be really awesome in daylight conditions. Forget about low light though, as the camera optics and the hardware are too constrained to perform adequately. That said, the video recording on this device is pretty decent too. Take a look at a full HD 1080p(actually 1920Ã1088) video sample with ambient stereo audio â. As you can see above, even though the audio is stereo, it is a bit quiet and not that clear partly because of the 32KHz codec. Recording at just 7Mbps bitrate, the video quality is not that great either, with constantly fluctuating white balance and exposure. Overall, it is just average but decent enough for a smartphone.. The Meizu MX2 runs on a custom made homegrown SoC called the MX5S.. CPU: MX5S, 1.6 GHz 4-core A9, 32 nm HKMG. Others: new generation of noise-reducing chip, dual-battery managing chip, independent audio decoding chip, independent photographic processing chip. Camera takes great pictures, only rarely. The MX5S is actually based on the Samsung Exynos 4412 that powers the Samsung Galaxy Note II and other similar devices from Samsung. The 1.6 GHz Quad Core A9 chip is really powerful, giving the the MX2 a nice performance boost. Graphics are powered by the Mali 400MP4 GPU which is quad core again, and provides ample amounts of power for gaming and other strenuous tasks. And as noted above, it has additional specific chips for image processing, noise reduction in calls, battery management and audio decoding. These are usually part of the SoC, but since it is a custom chip solution, Meizu might have gone for a tighter integration with hardware and software with these single purpose chips. You get 2GB of RAM out of which 1.83 GB is available, with around 50% of it always free under normal usage.. In terms of real time performance, the MX2 is very fast and fluid. The stock UI is not much of a problem for the powerful 4412 chip to render and games are not a problem at all too. We tried some casual games as well as tasking games such as Asphalt 7 and got great performance throughout. We also conducted some synthetic benchmark tests with the device and here are the results â. This is how it compares with other devices with similar chipsets.. As you can see above, this is much in line with the Galaxy Note II, and do remember that this device also released almost an year back, so the new devices have an unfair advantage. All said, the real life performance is just as good as any other device we have used, which is good. So, yes, overall performance is really good irrespective of what the benchmark scores say.. The Meizu MX2 is not stocked with connectivity options unlike other devices we have seen. As we noted that this is a custom chip, there has been some cut down on unnecessary hardware, and it shows.. It has 3G HSPA+ connectivity with the 2100 MHz band that happily works in India with optimal speed. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.0 and WiFi b/g/n with WiFi Direct. There is no DLNA, FM Radio or NFC, so thatâs a bummer, but there is GLONASS, GPS and inertial navigation using the gyroscope so youâre well covered in terms of navigation options.. The MX2 comes in various storage options, and weâve got the base model with 16 GB of internal memory. The user available storage is at 13.57GB which is quite sufficient for most functions, but the lack of a micro SD slot is a concern for music and movie lovers alike. As mentioned earlier, there are a lot of sensors on this device which is unsurprising for any modern phone. Among other output devices, the loudspeaker deserves a mention, not for its merits rather for its lack of loudness. It is really silent on most occasions and we wished it was louder for calls as well as music.. The Meizu MX2 is yet another Android device that doesnât look like one. Running on a heavily modified custom skin called the âFlyme OS 2.0â, the MX2 is in a league of devices that donât look or function anything like the stock Android interface but retains the app base and other Android advantages. Running on Android 4.1.1, the Flyme OS is blessed with project butter and Google Now, but the other functions are strictly controlled like, you know, iOS. You get three standard shortcuts at the bottom, for the dialer, âslide up to unlockâ and the messages app. You have access to the camera from swipe from any side of the edges, left or right and of course the notification drop down is accessible for quick access to all the system level notifications from the lock screen. You have an extremely cool animation that gets activated during charging, and has quick controls for music when it is playing. Again, it is very simple and beautiful, and much like iOS, it is a controlled experience here.. The notifications drop down bar is actually dynamic, with it resizing itself according to the content. While you get lots of quick actionable items because of rich notifications in Android 4.1.1, the drop down becomes bigger if you have many items. There are the standard toggles on the bar for the connectivity options and even quick network mode and WiFi selection, which is much welcome, but we canât help but miss the rich notifications on all items, not just the first one, which is how it works in the Flyme OS.. Coming to the launcher, again, it is very much like iOS. There is a dock of three or five customizable shortcuts, with the one in the middle(Browser) being persistent. Above the dock is a grid of app icons, 4X4 with options to add widgets(limited selection) if you need to clutter it up. Honestly, we think that copying iOS is a poor design decision, but all hail Android for its flexibility, we can actually install third party launchers. But before that, we did extensively use the default launcher, and it is flexible in a different way, using a Theme manager. There are a LOT of custom made themes from users and developers alike which changes the styles of the OS including icons, tool tips, dialer, slider controls and what not, and it makes for interesting themes. it is almost like the jail broken iPhones and their springboard themes. There is even a iOS 7 theme which suddenly makes sense because it does nicely fit with the launcher, ha!. The settings menu of the launcher is feature rich and allows you to control most aspects of the device much like any Android device, but there are a few things missing, as well as additional here. The customize menu has the theme manager that lets you choose custom themes, and it even lets you set the default launcher in case you have installed any third party launcher, which you mostly will, or at least we recommend you do. The WiFi Direct option inside WiFi lets you communicate or set up local networks within its sub menu. The Display menu has options to control the ambient light sensor and the light intensity of the home key. The other important additions are hidden under the accessibility menu, with options like haptic feedback, light feedback, USB fast charging, Screen halftone(saves battery) and even CPU usage levels, which are important to save battery. You can check out all the options here in these screenshots above, and you will then understand what we are talking about.. Overall the user interface is really slick and minimal, with white and dark gray being the theme. Other OEMs need to take note of these Chinese interfaces and learn a thing or two, seriously. Since the device has only one hardware capacitive button, the others were rendered in a bottom bar, like the back and contextual menu, much like what you see on other phones with overlaid shortcuts. While it is non existent for its default apps, third party apps do miss out on some screen real estate in portrait, but things get better in landscape as the back button and the option automatically re-arrange themselves to the top and adds a contextual menu to the top right of the notification bar. This works irrespective of the app being default or third party.. Speaking of default apps, utilities like Calculator, recorder and alarm clock were nicely designed, but the file manager stands out, with a great two column lay out and quick access to all kinds of files you mostly need. The gallery app has different auto albums and integrates well with the camera, however we wish itâd been a little bit faster in decoding all the pics. The Music and video players are pretty nice too, with their own OS-styled UIs. To make sure none look remotely like Android, every default app is skinned with a unified design in mind, and even in depth settings look nothing like Android, which is really surprising. The only Google apps pre installed with this device are Play Store, Search and Maps, but you can download any other Google app from the store and start using them, like for example, GMail, which does not come pre installed. You can even change the keyboard to the default stock one by downloading it from the Play Store, but the default keyboard itself is really nice, with an extra row always in reach. Make sure you delete the Chinese language packs for the keyboard as they were kinda intrusive at first even when typing in English.. Software wise, this is possibly one of the most polished experiences you will ever have, but a bit constrained if you are going to hold on to the stock launcher. But, like us, if you just load up a third party launcher like Nova, you can experience a decent Android UI as well as an extremely polished Meizu Flyme UI, all in one. The Meizu MX2 has a 1750 mAh Lithium Polymer battery, which is quite small in modern smartphones. With a 4.4 inch display, the battery struggles to keep its life going for a whole day. Using 3G often kills it faster, with it completely depleted in 7-8 hours, but if youâre on WiFi and usage is average, the battery life comes for 16-19 hours at a stretch. It definitely has better standby times than other devices we have seen, so in that case, it is definitely good but the actual usage times are much lesser than modern devices with bigger batteries.. Rated at 10 hours of talktime and 33o hours of standby on 3G, the battery can withstand a good deal of music usage, thanks to the dedicated low power chip. There are various chips employed to take over low power processing so as to offload the CPU, and that technique works in the favor of the longevity of the battery. The accessibility settings provide lots of options to reduce battery usage including haptic feedback, light key feedback, intensity and even CPU throttling. This helps in increasing the battery life to an extent. There were no in built power saving options, as even the battery sub menu inside the settings was missing. Overall, we would say the battery life is just average and nothing spectacular.. In the end, I completely loved to use the Meizu MX2. It turned a lot of heads due to its stunningly sleek design and the amazing display, which was a great window to show off the beautiful UI and overall performance. However, the camera was a mixed bag. Even though it produced really great results, it was just unreliable, and that goes for the battery life too, which is just average. But, is the Meizu MX2 good enough? Definitely! Devices like these have constantly impressed us mainly due to our low expectations from a Chinese brand. But even then, overall as a phone, the MX2 stands out from the crowd with a consistently beautiful hardware and software experience that you donât see on many Android devices these days. It might be too late to recommend this device as rumours of a MX3 are already doing its rounds, but if you are looking for a compact and good looking Android device, donât buy the specced-down Minis, but the MX2 instead and youâll be quite satisfied..

Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ hands-on: The devil is in the details. Meizu MX2 packs 1.6GHz quad-core chip, 4.4-inch display and Jelly Bean, due mid-December. Amidst the fierce competition in the Chinese mobile market, Meizu has managed to keep up with its annual cycle to unveil its latest flagship device, the MX2. Announced at the launch event in Beijing earlier today, the MX2 comes with a Samsung-made 1.6GHz, Cortex-A9 quad-core SoC dubbed "MX5S," along with 2GB of RAM, a 30-percent faster GPU, a 4.4-inch 347ppi (1,280 x 800) gapless display with 3.15mm bezel and efficient "New Mode 2" technology (the description of which sounds like IGZO to us), an improved eight-megapixel BSI F/2.4 camera and a choice of 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of built-in memory. There's also a front-facing camera, dual-mic noise cancellation, MHL video output, S/PDIF audio output, a non-removable 1,800mAh battery, Bluetooth 4.0 and HSPA+ radio at 2,100MHz (2G at 900/1800). As before, the white double injection-molded back cover can be taken off to access the SIM card slot, but there should also be various color options in the near future. Read on for more info, and do also check out the official introduction video after the break.. Update: We now have some hands-on photos courtesy of Stone Ip from Engadget Chinese. They're in the second gallery below.. Gallery: Meizu MX2 packs 1.6GHz quad-core chip, 4.4-inch display and Jelly Bean, due mid-December | 12 Photos. Gallery: Meizu MX2 hands-on | 25 Photos. In terms of software, the Android phone is powered by "Flyme 2.0," which is essentially Meizu's heavily customized Jelly Bean that attempts to bring the best of both worlds. One of the 3,452 enhancements Meizu implemented is the "Smart Bar," where Meizu has somehow merged the app's bottom menu bar and the system's virtual soft key bar for the sake of screen space and intuitiveness. That said, the home button is excluded as the MX2 has a capacitive button for that (as opposed to the old dome-shaped physical button; which also begs the question as to why not just use real buttons for all three soft keys like in the olden days). Another highlight is that in addition to the existing Flyme Cloud backup and phone tracking service, Meizu's also finally launching a much-needed free video and lossless music cloud platform, and this time it's done in collaboration with legit content providers like Sina, Tencent and LeTV. As for the rest, many other old goodies have been preserved, so fans of the original Flyme OS should quickly familiarize themselves with the new phone. For those who are brave enough, the MX2 will be rootable, so feel free to mess about.. The Meizu MX2 will be available in China from mid-December, and the three memory options will be priced at Â¥2,499 ($400), Â¥2,999 ($480) and Â¥3,999 ($640), respectively. It'll sure be a tough fight against the likes of Xiaomi and Huawei , but hey, we won't judge until we get to give the MX2 a thorough test drive.. android , android 4.1 , Android4.1 , china , featured , features , flyme , flyme 2.0 , Flyme2.0 , hands-on , jelly bean , JellyBean , meizu , meizu mx2 , MeizuMx2 , mobilepostcross , mx2 , new mode2 , NewMode2 , quad core , QuadCore , video.

News Review Phones Xiaomi Huawei Meizu nubia OnePlus OPPO vivo ZTE All Giveaway Deals Shop Forums. by Rosgani Dec 7, 2012 5:49 pm 0. Meizu MX2 is now become the most talked Android smartphone, and much people is concern to this phone. As nature is indispensable to the special benefits of important models â we got a couple picture of Meizu MX2 teardown (dismantling).. Thanks to the simple design, since Meizu add a simple back cover to the MX2 machine, the back cover is very easy to open and you can open this back cover by your self without a problem.. When we open the back cover, we see the Meizu playfully Laser Marking endless variety of serial number and 3C signs, the dark golden accompanied by solid black bottom looks really very sexy and mysterious. Of course, then looking back cover also no hard to âstripped offâ, use the screwdriver to get started! (Picture 04). First, we start from the lower body, unscrew the panel below to see a small plate, above the most garish of course that is affixed on the yellow transparent plastic USB interface.. Following later get that done, then we can take off shirt âunscrew fixed above version 9 screws (top middle sinking screw is hidden), we can see the general structure of the machine.. Say, the internal structure of MX2 to our first image is look like iPhone, please forgive us for such a vulgar metaphor, but here is absolutely no commendatory or derogatory meaning, can only say that is really very much similarity with the iPhone.. Next syncope, we get the battery to be removed in order to prevent electric shock.. From this figure, we can also see the MX2 a large area within the coverage of the black thermal layer. I think it is the thermal conductivity at the moment is certainly not as good as maintenance.. Also the battery before the split-off of many machine in the battery compartment, with double-sided adhesive. (Truth MX2 work is very compact, so the battery compartment looks really quite like the âwarehouseâ).. After removing the battery, we want to tke off the MX2 motherboard. Old steps, pulling cable and then tighten the screws, motherboard very easily to remove.. Motherboard is pull out and all the surface is covered, and this is very small motherboard but very nice design for PCB parts. While we foun the camera connector on it.. Second we remove the camera ready to dismantle the shield, it nevertheless found that the shield is welded on the PCB!. We have to carefullu to remove this part with the air soft remover tool.. After struggling to remove the shield, we can finally see the chip inside ~. Next, we take a look at that we are very concerned about the chipset.. Concluded it to the overall MX2 work is very paranoid.Whether it is a large area of black thermal layer or sealed the shield, these things have not appeared on many phones are able to see in the Meizu MX2, this very âgenerousâ paranoid, I believe that consumers are still veryfavorite.. Both overall layout, or some small details seem to be intentionally or unintentionally, so we feel very close with the iPhone.. Well, the MX2 dismantling evaluation here. Believe that the MX2âs internal workmanship and materials used to make most people satisfied, and we read out from the dismantling of the MX2 Meizu âdreamâ â to make a good phone..

Brand name of the company that manufactures the device.. Ðlternative names, under which the model is known.. the horizontal side of the device when it is used in its standard orientation.. the vertical side of the device when it is used in its standard orientation.. Information about the thickness/depth of the device in different measurement units.. Information about the weight of the device in different measurement units.. Estimated volume of the device, calculated from the dimensions provided by the manufacturer. Applies for devices in the form of a rectangular parallelepiped.. Information about the colors, in which the device is available in the market.. Information about the type and size (form factor) of the SIM card used in the device.. Information about the number of SIM cards, supported by the device.. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) was developed to replace the analog cellular network (1G), therefore it is referred to as a 2G mobile network. It has been improved with the addition of General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and later via the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology.. UMTS stands for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System. Based on the GSM standard, it is deemed as a 3G mobile network standard. It has been developed by the 3GPP and its major advantage is the provision of greater bandwidth and spectral efficiency, due to the W-CDMA technology.. There are several network technologies that enhance the performance of mobile networks mainly by increased data bandwidth. Information about the communication technologies supported by the device and their respective uplink and downlink bandwidth.. Information about the operating system used by the device as well as its version.. Name and version of the user interface (UI) used by the operating system (OS).. The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. Similar to the CPU, the GPU consists of processing units called cores. They handle the computation of graphics in various applications.. The frequency is the clock rate of the graphic processor (GPU), which is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. RAM (Random-Access Memory) is used by the operating system and all installed applications. Data in the RAM is lost after the device is turned off or restarted.. Information about the number of RAM channels integrated in the SoC. More channels mean higher data transfer rates.. RAM frequency relates directly to the rate of reading/writing from/in the RAM memory.. Information about the capacity of the built-in storage of the device. Sometimes one and the same model may is offered in variants with different internal storage capacity.. One of the main characteristics of the display is its type/technology, on which depends its performance.. In mobile devices display size is represented by the length of its diagonal measured in inches.. The ratio between the long and the short side of the display. The display resolution shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical side of the screen. The higher the resolution is, the greater the detail of the displayed content.. Information about the number of pixels per centimeter (ppcm) or per inch (ppi) of the display. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed and clearer is the information displayed on the screen.. The color depth of the display is also known as bit depth. It shows the number of bits used for the color components of one pixel. Information about the maximum number of colors the screen can display.. The estimated percentage of the screen area from the device's front area.. Information about other functions and features of the display.. Sensors vary in type and purpose. They increase the overall functionality of the device, in which they are integrated..

Meizufans would have never been such a success story without the people behind it.. It has been a great and wonderful time with everyone on board. It was you to carry Meizufans on when everything seemed hopeless. It was you to make the site raise to unknown heights. There have been big hopes with Meizu's new manager, however he is just as dissapointing as the previous one used to be. This is the very exact reason why I have decided to terminate all operations. Meizufans used to be a site from fans for fans. Being such, means to have a passion for something you like, a passion which I lost. Thanks for the great memories, the new people I have met and the experiences I have made. There are no backups of the site!. What will happen with my account data like emails, IPs or uploads?. At the time you are reading this message, the entire server has been wiped clean. All databases, files and everything else related to Meizufans has been deleted without being able to restore it. This does include Google Analytics as well.. Will you start new projects, is there any chance to stay in touch and what is your next phone?. Depending how much time I have, I always work on new things. For the next time I want to get some rest, though. Meizufans has been a very long and exhausting chapter, so I think I deserved myself some vacation after 4 years, 3 months, 5 days and 30 minutes of service. To answer the question about staying in touch with me - I want and need some time for myself. Not that I dislike you, however, I decided to back out fully. This is also the reason why I deleted stuff like my LinkedIn profile and will no longer attend the Telegram group. I've already got a new one - Smartisan Nut Pro 2..
