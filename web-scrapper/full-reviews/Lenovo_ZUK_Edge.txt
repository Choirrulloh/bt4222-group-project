Jego nazwa moÅ¼e CiÄ zmyliÄ Source: Komorkomania PL→EN Positive: Excellent display; high autonomy; fast charge; good cameras; decent speakers. Single Review, online available, Long, Date: 12/20/2016. Model : The Edge is ZUKâs latest 5.5 inch smartphone released by the Chinese manufacturer. This device should not be regarded as another Lenovo smartphone as the ZUK, notwithstanding it being a subsidiary of Lenovo, is selling devices exclusively using its own brand. It is apparent from its name that this smartphone is poised to achieve a bezel-less design. It may not be bezel-free akin to Xiaomi Mix; still, its display to body ratio is 86.4 %, which is good enough to give almost no space for your fingers to rest on. The Edge adopts double 2.5D glass design which is thin and strong and thereby making this smartphone more attractive and comfortable. The display is also coated with Corning Gorilla Glass for added protection. The screen features a super AMOLED TDDI screen with a pixel densitity of 403 PPI and 1920 x 1080 resolution. Visuals rendered are sharp and crisp with remarkable clarity thanks to the AMOLED technology. Enhanced with Dirac HD Sound, audio quality is beyond average. The dimensions measure at 142.9 x 74.5 x 7.68 mm and the smartphone weighs 160 g making it quite light, thin and small for a 5.5 inch smartphone. The battery life on this smartphone is remarkable as it is fitted with a large 3100 mAh battery. This is further enhanced with ZUKâs double chips charging technology, which enables the device to be charged faster and safer.. The Edge however, might not appeal very well to shutterbugs as it is supported with an 8 MP front facing camera and a primary 13 MP camera on its rear with auto focus and ISOCELL sensor. This is of course good enough, but other manufacturers have been able to offer higher resolution cameras with better optics. With these optics, users can be assured that images captured will be of proper quality but as mentioned, will not be the best the market can offer. The performance is remarkable as the smartphone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processer (14 nm Kryo Quad core 64-bit, 2.35 GHz). With 6 GB of RAM, multi-tasking capabilities on this smartphone are prompt and fast. Storage available is 64 GB, which is expendable via a microSD card. The Android 6.0 Marshmallow system can be upgraded to Android 7.0 Nougat according to Lenovo but there hasnât been any updates available as of now. It comes fitted with the latest USB type-C port. ZUK ships this smartphone in dual SIM mode. It is supported by a fingerprint sensor, which can be easily customized with gestures for unlocking purposes and ID recognition, thus improving security and convenience. Overall, ZUKâs Edge is an appealing, well-rounded phone as can be seen from its specs sheet. It is a cool smartphone which is loaded with the latest features. To top it off, it is also attractively priced which makes this device an option to look out for. At this price, the mediocre camera quality is forgivable.. This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. In 2011, Medion AG, a European computer hardware manufacturer, owned the majority of the company. In 2014, Lenovo took over Motorola Mobility, which gave them a boost in the smartphone market.. From 2014 to 2016 Lenovo's market share in the global notebook market was 20-21%, ranking second behind HP. In the smartphone market, Lenovo did not belong to the Top 5 global manufacturers in 2016..

I purchased this phone for it's dual SIM capabilities. It works great! The middle home button is very solid. I really enjoy the multi functionality it brings, it took a day or so to get used to the extra features it brings, but now it is like second nature. The fingerprint scanner seems to work very well, I have yet to have it not read correctly. I particularly like that you can map several fingers to it, very handy when you're busy and need to use your other fingers/hand. The size of the phone itself is just right. I have small hands, so the phones larger than this require me to use both hands because my thumbs don't reach across the screen. The phone is also very sleek, and asthetically pleasing..

Lenovo ZUK Edge Review: How Looks Lenovo’s Current Flagship. 2 72 7 minutes read. Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn StumbleUpon Tumblr Pinterest Reddit VKontakte Odnoklassniki Pocket. EIS + auxiliary sensor image stabilization,. Smartphone lovers have been waiting for the Lenovo ZUK Edge for a long time. And we have done as well. It’s conditioned with the fact the no-bezel smartphones have become a mainstream, and it’s been very interesting to know what will bring Lenovo to the market. After a couple of leaked photos finally we were able to get our hands on the Lenovo ZUK Edge on December 20 – the day when it was officially unveiled.. Actually this is not a curved screen smartphone like the Xiaomi Mi Note 2 and its rivals , but the Lenovo ZUK Edge is conditioned as a bezel-less (aka edge-to-edge) device. Its display occupies almost 86.4% of the front panel. This is not the best feature we have seen, as the same Mi Mix comes with 91.3%, but the ZUK Edge still looks quite astonishing and can make a tough competition to the Xiaomi Mi MIX and other bezel-less handsets. If ignoring this smartphone the Lenovo ZUK Edge can grab the first position from all other handsets from this category. To ascertain in my words look at the table below:. As you can see, only the Moto Z and iPhone 7 Plus can be compared to the ZUK Edge in terms of screen size. The rest of its rivals are the way smaller.. Anyway, the Lenovo ZUK Edge comes with an improved design. I guess no one will mind if I say it’s a combination of the ZUK Z2 and Z2 Pro. I mean it combines ZUK Z2 sided 2.5D glass and Z2 Pro’s metal frame design.. If looking at the hardware, the ZUK Edge is the first smartphone of Lenovo sporting a Snapdragon 821 processor that is also paired with a 6GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory.. It is also the first Lenovo phone to come with a touch Home button. Thus there is no capacitive home button on the fornt.. At last, the Lenovo ZUK Edge is priced at 2299 yuan ($331), which means the company continues coming in with cheap handsets providing great performance simultaneously.. The Lenovo ZUK Edge comes in a black packaging giving a good feel of quality. The top side carries only the name of the phone.. The bottom side comes with the phone’s model of Z2151, the memory configuration and detailed info about the phone including the color option. This is the titanium crystal black version.. The Lenovo ZUK Edge features a 5.5-inch Full HD TDDI display with a pixel density of 403PPI. The rest of display features include a contrast ratio of 1500:1, 85% of the NTSC color gamut, and the maximum brightness of 500 nits. It is also covered with a 2.5D glass. Agree this is not the best ZUK screen we have ever seen.. The proximity sensor along with a speaker and a front camera are located on the upper side of the front panel.. Below the screen we can find a touch sensitive Home button. It works identical to Meizu’s mBack – long press to return to previous screen, long press to go to main screen, slide left/right for different operations, and finally it supports fingerprint recognition.. The back panel of the Lenovo ZUK Edge comes with the same 2.5D glass covering. The rear camera is on the center accompanied with a dual-tone LED flash and oxygen sensors supporting heart rate monitoring and blood testing. The phone comes in a minimalist design and the titanium crystal black color makes it to look like a business smartphone.. The top of the phone carries only a small microphone hole for noise cancellation.. The bottom side comes with a 3.5mm audio jack, another microphone, a speaker and a USB Type-C interface.. The power button and volume rocker are located on the right side.. The SIM card slot is placed on the left. There are two nano SIM card slots, but unfortunately you can’t find a microSD card expansion.. We have already got acquainted with the dimensions of the Lenovo ZUK Edge from the table above. It weighs only 160 grams and there are two color options – titanium black and ceramic white.. At the end, the Lenovo ZUK Edge packaging includes:. The Lenovo ZUK Edge is powered with a Snapdragon 821 CPU that uses second gen Samsung 14nm FiFET LPP technology. Thus it comes with a quad-core 4x Qualcomm Kryo CPU clocked up to 2.35GHz and Adreno 530 GPU. The Snapdragon 821 provides 10% better performance in comparison to older Snapdragon 820, while the GPU performance has improved by 5%.. Moreover, the Lenovo ZUK Edge is equipped with a 64GB fast UFS 2.0 internal memory and dual-channel 6GB LPDDR4 RAM. This configuration provides the best performance for small apps as well as large 3D games. So users will face no problems when launching different apps.. To understand whether the manufacturer was able to get the most from these configuration we tested the Lenovo ZUK Edge via different benchmarks.. Looking at the first benchmarks at AnTuTu 6.3.1 we can see most of time the Snapdragon 821 CPU works between 50% – 100% most of time, the overall load is between 80%-100% that means it provides too high CPU utilization.. As for each core, all four cores work simultaneously, but the large cores (2-3) can reach the highest frequency of 2.35GHz, while the small cores (0-1) load up to 60%. Therefore, we can conclude the Snapdragon 821 overall performance is stable, all four cores run at the same time, and the chip is able to control the power and core heat.. Thereafter, the Lenovo ZUK Edge was tested via an AnTuTu sub-test. It scored 162,373 points, and this helps the phone ranking on the third position after the iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 7. Moreover, the ZUK Edge was compared to the iPhone 7, and as you can see the overall performance provided by the Snapdragon 821 is better than Apple’s newest phone.. Below is the comparison table of different CPUs and smartphones. The ZUK Edge is more powerful than the LeEco Le Pro 3 .. GeekBench 4 CPU test showed the Lenovo ZUK Edge is not as good as we think. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro and LeEco Le Pro 3 scored more than the ZUK Edge.. If taking into account this benchmark results, the Kirin 960 is the winner.. Then it was tested via GFXBench 4 GPU test. According to the results, the ZUK Edge is in the game again showing 1080p video support at 96fps.. Three beasts in face of the Lenovo ZUK Edge (left), Huawei Mate 9 Pro (middle), and Meizu Pro 6 Plus (right) were put in the AndroBench 5 storage performance test. As you see, the ZUK Edge and Meizu 6 Plus Pro scored almost the same points because both of them come with UFS 2.0 memory, while their main rival sports a fast UFS 2.1 memory.. As for the PCMark comprehensive performance testing shows the Lenovo ZUK Edge reaches 7235 points, which brings the fifth position to the phone.. After the 3DMark GPU test the phone scores 2570 points ranking on the fourth position after the Vivo Xplay5 Ultimate.. I guess all these tests we can conclude the Lenovo ZUK Edge provides great performance that can compete with the top-notch devices.. The Lenovo ZUK Edge is equipped with a 3100mAh battery supporting fast charge technology, but the charger coming with phone is only 13.25W (5.3V / 2.5A). Taking into account this fact we decided to put its battery in a few tests.. The first test was made when there was remaining only 2% of power. It was plugged to charge and charging data was written down for every 10 minutes.. The test showed it took only half an hour to charge the phone to 35%, and one hours to charge to 72%. Than the charging speed decreased, and it took 120 minutes to charge fully.. Thereafter, the phone was tested via AnTuTu battery testing, and the ZUK Edge battery discharged from 89% to 84% in 25 minutes using it heavily. Moreover, the phone was discharged completely after 8 hours.. The PCMark showed 9 hours and 17 minutes.. At last, the ZUK Edge was tested for maximum temperature, and it reach up to 42 ?, which is a normal data.. The phone is packed with a 13MP camera powered with Samsung 2M8 sensor. It comes with Samsung ISOCELL technology that ‘increases light sensitivity and effectively controls the absorption of electrons, resulting in higher color fidelity even in poor lighting conditions’. The sensor size is 1/2.6” at pixel size of 1.34-micron, and the aperture is f/2.2.. The Lenovo ZUK Edge camera features include:. There is also an 8MP front camera supporting up to 1080p video recording.. The Lenovo ZUK Edge camera app is too easy to use. There are not many adjustable options.. The camera default ratio is 4:3 at 13MP, but you can increase it up to 16:9 at 10MP.. This camera doesn’t take ideal photos when capturing daytime.. But once the HDR is on, the photos become quite acceptable.. Due to small f/2.2 aperture outdoor photos can be annoying.. Well, this is not a Sony sensor, and seem it affects the photo quality. But this camera comes with a list of useful features such as EIS and nighttime shooting. The latter is the key feature of this camera.. Lenovo tries to change the things with its ZUK series smartphones. The ZUK Z2 was priced at 1799 yuan ($259) and it was the first smartphone with Snapdragon 820 at such a low price tag. There also was the ZUK Z2 Pro – the world’s first 3D body smartphone fighting in the high-end market. In this sense, the ZUK Edge can be considered as a ‘bezel-less flagship’ at an affordable price tag.. As for other features we didn’t talk in the article, the Lenovo ZUK Edge runs on ZUI 2.5 based on Android 6.0 that should be upgraded to Android 7.0 in the nearest future. Thus this handset is great even in terms of software.. I guess, all the abovementioned features showed we are dealing with a powerful flagship that will hit the market in January 2017..

‘More screen, less body’ is the name of the game for the Lenovo Zuk Edge. What made Xiaomi’s Mi Mix exciting was its high screen-to-body ratio which, when combined with its ceramic back, gave. the phone a sleek and futuristic aesthetic. Lenovo hopes to introduce that same level of excitement with the Zuk Edge , which looks to have a leg up over the Mi Mix in more ways than just its pricing.. Beginning our tour with the design, the star of the show is the Zuk Edge’s. extremely slim front bezels, which enable. 86.4 percent of the front to be covered with screen. Even with such a high screen-to-body ratio, the Zuk Edge. retains the traditional smartphone design, with an earpiece and 8-megapixel selfie camera above. and a fingerprint sensor that doubles as a home button below the 5.5-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 resolution display.. Unlike other fingerprint sensors, which carve out their own spaces either on the front or rear panel, the Zuk Edge’s reader. Such a design is rumored to make an appearance on the Galaxy S8, though it seems as if Lenovo beat Samsung to the punch.. Under the hood, Qualcomm’s 2.35GHz quad-core Snapdragon 821 and either 4GB or 6GB RAM power the Zuk Edge. The 64GB might be spacious enough for most, but if you need more, you should know that there is no MicroSD card slot for expansion. There is a 3,100mAh power pack that should see you through the day and not much after that, though the option for fast-charge through the USB Type-C port is always welcome.. In terms of software, the phone runs Lenovo’s. Overall, the Zuk Edge looks to usher in a design language that focuses on. minimizing as much bezel as possible while retaining the traditional smartphone. Thankfully, the phone will do so without breaking the bank: it will sell for $330 with 4GB RAM and $360 with 6GB RAM.. ship starting January 1 in China, with no news regarding international availability..

Lenovo tries to change the things with its ZUK series smartphones. The ZUK Z2 was priced at 1799 yuan ($259) and it was the first smartphone with Snapdragon 820 at such a low price tag. There also was the ZUK Z2 Pro – the world's first 3D body.... Last week I share my first impressions of Zuk Edge!

ZUK EdgeZUK Edge è un prodotto particolare, interessante e sopratutto molto bello. Sotto la scocca troviamo un hardware dalle buone prestazioni e nel complesso un dispositivo bilanciato. Al prezzo di vendita forse non stravolgerà il mercato ma se.... Soll uns aber nicht weiter stören, denn mit einer Screen-to-Body-Ratio von 86,4 Prozent weiß das Display auch so auf Anhieb zu überzeugen. Der Rest der Spezifikationen muss sich dahinter aber wahrlich nicht verstecken – lasst uns daher erst mal auf die.... Lenovo Zuk Edge è un terminale indubbiamente molto interessante. Ha delle linee moderne, display con cornici ridotte, sensore di impronte, rilevazione del battito cardiaco, una buona fotocamera e un hardware che permette di far girare il tutto.... Sudah banyak vendor yang memproduksi smartphone. Dengan begini, tentu saja sangat sulit untuk menentukan mana smartphone Android yang berkualitas dan mana yang tidak.Semua orang tentu mengharapkan smartphone dengan kualitas terbaik. Ist das ZUK Edge nun eine Geheimwaffe aus dem Hause Lenovo? Da gibt es ein klares Jain! Es ist eigentlich das typische China-Smartphone, welches ausschließlich über Import-Shops bezogen werden kann und für ein Flaggschiff sehr günstig ausfällt. Von Lenovo kommt auch das ZUK Edge, wir können das aktuelle High-End-Smartphone dank der Kollegen von Trading Shenzhen jetzt ausführlich testen. Aber vorerst gibt es das übliche Hands-on, der erste Eindruck nach den ersten Stunden mit dem Gerät. Das Edge von ZUK ist ein monströses High-End-Smartphone. Dinge wie wasserdichtes Gehäuse, drahtloses Aufladen und eine bessere Kamera würden es perfektionieren. Gleichzeitig muss man den Preis im Auge behalten und bereit für einige Kompromisse sein. 外觀、手感及做工 雖說 Edge 的事前預熱宣傳有意無意都在往小米 MIX 身上靠，但其整體的設計風格，其實還是跟 ZUK 之前的產品一脈相承的。如果簡單用一句話概括，Edge 實際上就是額頭、下巴壓扁，然後把後蓋玻璃拍平的 Z2 Pro。其機身從正面看會顯得有點矮矮胖胖（高寬是 142.9 x 74.5mm），但如果拿來跟別的 5.5 吋手機一比，就會發現它其實還是要小上一號的。 不過儘管如此，Edge.... 前面也说了，Edge 很有可能会成为 ZUK 这个品牌的收官之作，如果真是如此的话，那这款手机的表现论完美谢幕可能有点抬高，但其大胆的正面设计，相信还是值得我们用力鼓掌的。在硬件难以拼出胜负的前提下，Edge 凭借着正面高占比屏幕 + 隐形指纹这一「面」之长，成功树立起了自己的差异性。虽然拍照、续航令其无法成为一款好的「水桶」，但只要能满足那些追求观感冲击力的人，其实也已经相当不错了。回头看看，无论是 ZUK 还是.... In conclusione lo ZUK Edge è sicuramente un dispositivo molto interessante sul fronte prestazionale ed estetico, in quanto presenta un display da 5.5 pollici in un corpo compatto, caratterizzato dall'eccelsa ottimizzazione delle cornici e dei bordi....

Lenovo Zuk Edge Review, Price and Comparison. Lenovo's online brand Zuk has gained sufficient traction. The Zuk Z2, which was later presented as Lenovo Z2 Plus in India, offered splendid value for money and included the high-end Snapdragon 820 SoC for an unprecedented price. Naturally, expectations from the next-in-line Zuk Edge are soaring sky high. Contrary to what the name might suggest, the Zuk Edge doesn't have Samsung flagships like curved edges. It's rather flat and boxy, but the Edge moniker does have a significance. The Zuk Edge display (Rumored to be 5.5-inches in size with Full HD resolution) runs from edge to edge, with minimal bezels on the sides. Other rumored features include 13MP rear camera, 8MP front shooter, fingerprint sensor, and 3000mAh battery. Since the handset is still in rumored phase, details are still sketchy. We will know more about the Zuk Edge Price and details regarding its availability in India very soon.. Edge to edge display Powerful chipset. No reviews found for this mobile.
