Specifications include a 6-inch HD display, Snapdragon 435 processor, 4GB RAM, 13MP rear camera, and an 8MP front-facing camera.. Technology Mobile & Tabs Gionee M7 Power first impressions: Big battery at mid-range price of Rs. Gionee M7 Power has a big 6-inch display with an aspect ratio of 18:9, and it sports extremely thin bezels on the sides. Gionee M7 Power is a thick phone at 8.60 mm. While it has a textured back, I’d recommend a back cover as it does not do a very good job of giving the device a grip. Speaker grille, a USB Type 2.0 charging port, and a 3.5mm headset jack are at the bottom. Gionee M7 Power runs company’s Amigo OS 5.0.3 based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat..

Smartphones with a full or bezel-less display are fast becoming a norm these days. The trend of bigger displays which sport thinner bezels has moved on from high-end phones to mid-range devices. Joining this latest ‘bezel-less’ trend is Gionee , which has launched its M7 Power smartphone in India. Gionee M7 boasts of a large full screen display coupled with a large 5,000mAh battery.. Gionee M7 Power has been priced at Rs 16,999. Specifications include a 6-inch HD + display, Snapdragon 435 processor, 4GB RAM, 13MP rear camera and an 8MP front-facing camera. We spent some time with the M7 Power, and here’s our first impression of the smartphone.. Gionee M7 Power Design and Display. Gionee M7 Power has a big 6-inch display with an aspect ratio of 18:9, and it sports extremely thin bezels on the sides. There’s no home button on the front and there’s a circular fingerprint sensor at the back to unlock the device. M7 Power is not apt for one-hand usage and I had to struggle to scrolling up and down the display while using it with one hand. However, the placement of fingerprint sensor works well for me and I had no trouble unlocking the phone with this feature.. Thanks to the 5000 mAh battery, Gionee M7 Power is on the bulkier side. Gionee M7 Power is a thick phone at 8.60 mm. While it has a textured back, I’d recommend a back cover as it does not give a strong grip. Even the smooth metal frames on the sides feel slippery.. Gionee M7 Power has the power button along with volume keys on the right. There is a single speaker grille, a micro-USB charging port and a 3.5mm headset jack at the bottom of the Gionee M7 Power.. The smartphone has an HD+ resolution screen (1440 x 720 pixels), which isn’t really acceptable at this price point. There’s no oleophobic coating and the display is prone to smudges and fingerprint marks. The screen works fine and the viewing angles are decent, except in bright sunlight where I had to struggle with the M7 Power’s display.. Gionee M7 Power gets a 13MP rear camera, while there’s an 8MP sensor on the front. While it does an average job of clicking pictures in bright outdoors, shots taken in low-light seem are not so great. Focus is not always quick, especially in low-light scenarios. Pictures taken using rear camera of Gionee M7 Power look a bit dull, and I’m not the biggest fan of the colour reproduction.. The front camera seems a notch better in my opinion. I liked the colour reproduction in selfies. It manages to capture details in pictures to a large extent and should keep selfie buffs happy.. Gionee M7 Power Processor, Battery, and Memory. Gionee M7 Power runs an octa-core Snapdragon 435 processor clocked at 1.4GHz. The smartphone seems to handle most day-to-day tasks like switching between multiple tabs, browsing Internet, social media quite well. However, we are yet to put the device to gaming and intensive multitasking tests to know more about its performance.. Gionee M7 Power features 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, which is expandable up to 256GB via a microSD card. It supports a hybrid SIM card slot, which means you can either put two Nano SIM cards or a SIM card and a microSD card.. Coming to the battery, it is 5000mAh which should easily last for two days on medium to heavy usage. We’ll have more on that front in our review. My problem is that it doesn’t support fast charging technology which is necessary given the battery size.. Gionee M7 Power runs company’s Amigo OS 5.0.3 based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. The user interface is different from other smartphones and non-Gionee users might take some time to get accustomed to it. There’s no app drawer and users can simply swipe right to access various apps. Gionee’s OS is very inspired from Apple ’s iOS .. One thing that I didn’t like about the M7 Power is that it comes pre-installed with lot of bloatware apps that you might not even need. For example, I found Xender, UC News, Flipkart , Gaama, Truecaller, UC Browser apps pre-loaded on my Gionee M7 Power.. Gionee is relying on a big battery and display for the M7 Power’s success. Still given the kind of competition in this segment, Gionee will have a tough time convincing buyers, especially with a price-tag of Rs 16,999. Other options in the market include Honor 9i, which comes with four cameras and a bigger display for just Rs 14,999..

There was some speculation on the official launch date of Gionee’s new device, but a September launch was expected. Gionee finally confirmed the dates via a post on Weibo , where it posted a device teaser with the launch dates.. It’s quite clear from the teaser that the phone will follow the 2017 trend of killing off bezels. The device also looks to be quite large, possibly in Samsung Galaxy Note 8 territory.. Various rumours circulating around the internet suggest that the device will be powered by a MediaTek Helio P30 chip and that it will feature a 6-inch display in an 18:9 aspect ratio. Given the ratio, the image resolution is slightly larger than full HD at 2160x1080. We’re expecting to see at least 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage. The camera configuration is expected to be a 16 MP rear and 8 MP front camera setup. The rumours we’ve seen so far make no mention of a dual-camera setup, which is fast becoming the norm. The front and rear cameras are expected to record videos in 4K and 2K respectively.. A report on globemobiles suggests that the device will debut with Android Nougat 7.1.1..

Joining the ranks of 2017's big screen display flagships are Gionee's M7 and M7 Power. These two phones represent the seventh generation of Gionee's line of smartphones, and these two sport a fabulous FullVision display that has a huge screen-to-body ratio. These phones will no doubt be challenging Xiaomi's Mi MIX 2 in China, and they certainly have the work cut out for them.. The highlight of the Gionee M7 is its 6-inch FullVision display with an 18:9 aspect ratio and 2,160 x 1,080 pixels. It's the same aspect ratio we've seen on other prominent smartphones this year like the Samsung Galaxy S8 , the LG V30 , the Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 and the Apple iPhone X .. It also has the newly-announced MediaTek Helio P30 octa-core processor and chipset, backed with a generous 6GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory with a microSD card slot.

The M7 will come in five colors: Sapphire Blue, Star Blue, Maple Red, Champagne Gold and Black. It is on sale in China for CNY 2,799, or about PHP 21,458.. The Gionee M7 Power, also known as Big Gold Steel 2, is the light version of the M7, streamlined to be more energy-efficient. It's about the same size, but the 6-inch screen is down to 1,440 x 720 resolution, with a less hungry Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The camera is 13 megapixels at the back, while the front is 8 megapixels. It also runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat but has a more generous 5,000mAh battery with fast-charging capability.. The Gionee M7 Power (Big Gold Steel 2) will come in Black, Champagne Gold and Blue colors and the price will be CNY 1,999 (about PHP 15,320) and will go on sale on September 30..
