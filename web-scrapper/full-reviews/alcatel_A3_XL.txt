Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging.

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time 4.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time 16.7 days (400 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features Album art cover, Background playback. GSM 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD) Bands 1, 3, 7, 8, 20, 28. Data LTE Cat 4 (150/50 Mbit/s).

Alcatel A3 XL phone: Full, in-depth review. Alcatel A3 XL phone: Full, in-depth review. A sub-$200 6-inch Android smartphone? How cheap is too cheap?. 219 Users want this. 4.25 / 5. It's just $179 and yet we struggled to criticise this 6" Android smartphone. Enthusiasts will find it a bit slow, but cash-strapped casual users will love it.. Alcatel A3 XL - looks like most other phones. Alcatel A3 XL - The textured corporate grey belies the $179 price tag. There's a fingerprint reader but it's not the quickest or most reliable. The main speaker is at the rear and, for a phone, is really rather good. Alcatel A3 XL camera review Up close and in low light, the A3 XL captured a sharp, colourful image. Food shots may need a filter to brighten things up. Read more: Kogan Agora 8 phone: Full, in-depth review. A collage feature lets you combine images. The A3 XL struggled badly in very low light. In mediocre light you'll get some blur but pictures can still be sharp enough to use. They may need some colour correction though. Panoramas are low resolution and some lighting transitions can border on harsh. Landscapes looked better with HDR turned on, but you have to hold the camera still and wait a while for image processing. Beauty Mode can add a nice subtle hue to selfies (l). However, in less-than-optimum light, things got blurry quickly, not least because of shutter lag. The HD video will be a bit low resolution and fuzzy for some people.. [Update: Our initial review of this phone used a review model with old software (and some lesser hardware) that was particularly slow and laggy. We've since used an updated model and found that things were much improved. The overall score has increased accordingly.]. We’ve been flooded with new phones over recent months and the differences have all been relatively minor. But now here’s Alcatel with a six-inch smartphone that makes the $300 Moto G5 look expensive. But how cheap is too cheap?. 6in, 720 x 1280 (245ppi) LCD screen, 2GB/16GB RAM, 1.1GHz quad-core A53 CPU, Mali-T720MP2. GPU, 8MP rear and 5MP front cameras, microSD, microSIM, Micro USB, Android 7, 3000mAh battery, 165 x 83 x 8mm, 145g. We don’t expect too much at this price but the A3 XL still punches above its weight. The front screen with its rounded corners looks similar to most other phones and the textured, grey back looks business-like. It doesn’t look like a cheap phone.. The six-inch screen gets bright and colours are impressively vibrant. While the 720p HD resolution is down on many rivals and the relatively-large size means that there are only 245 pixels per inch, at least icons and text appear larger than usual which will be a boon for those who are fed up of squinting at the minuscule. lettering of small, Ultra HD screens.. The Operating System is a basic Android 7 and is simple enough to use. But it doesn’t take long for the limitations of the 1.1GHz quad-core processor to rear their head. Basic apps can take a moment or two longer to open than we've been used to and responsiveness is a bit low compared to the rest of the market. Loading mail apps can take an extra second or two but scrolling through them is fast enough.. A high-end, computationally-demanding game like Need For Speed No Limits takes an age to load but the well-optimised coding meant that it was still playable albeit with a few frame drops. Dropping down to Angry Birds , loading times were a bit slower than usual but not by much and the game was very playable. Pokemon Go (with its new gym update) took a long time to load up. It can be a bit juddery and laggy at times but it’s very playable.. There’s a fingerprint reader on the back which is an impressive feature at this price. However, it’s not the fastest or most reliable unit we’ve seen. It frequently took a few attempts to recognise our finger but at least the feature is there and you don’t have to use it.. All in all, we were impressed. An early version of the software on this phone led us to believe it was annoyingly slow and laggy but really, while it's not as responsive as more-expensive models, it's still usable for most smartphone applications (forget about VR though!). We were actually impressed with the speakers. Regular phone quality was decent and conference calls were loud and clear – more so than some pricier rivals.. Playing our treble-rich test track, Bjork’s Play Dead , demonstrated an impressive amount of volume, clarity and even a little punch – despite an almost complete lack of bass. Indeed, performance here exceeded many top phones.. Switching to the bass heavy Army of Me,. we were again greeted with an impressively-rounded and loud sound despite the lack of bass. We should also note that the speaker is located on the back and sound is much better when turning the phone over and listening to it that way rather than it bouncing off a table or whatever.. Ultimately, though the Arkamys -optimised speaker does a very good job compared to any phone at any price.. The main camera is only 8-megapixels but it’s capable of sharp and colourful pictures in good lighting – up close and at distance.. Things can fall off a cliff in low light but even so, some mediocre-lit indoors shots still came out usable. In the dark though, there’s not much to see.. Panoramas are just about acceptable but you wouldn’t want to print them out. They’re low resolution and some lighting blending transitions can be verge on harsh.. Landscapes looked better with HDR but using this did mean there was a few seconds wait while image processing occurred.. The front camera is only 5-megapixels and it’s not great in low light per se. However, there's a small LED flash that can make up for mediocre lighting. This can also make you look a little palid but Beauty Mode can add some colour to those cheeks (if required) without making you look ridiculously airbrushed. Nonetheless, many of our shots came out looking soft or had colour casts. It's not the best phone for Narcissists.. Video is captured at 720p (HD). It’s naturally a bit fuzzy on high resolution screens and gets grainier when in low light. It’s poor in very low light and background noise can be sound a bit robotic. But for undemanding users it was all still (just about) usable. It helps if lighting is good and everyone is still, though..

I would recommend this device for families and small businesses who want one safe place to store all their important digital content and a way to easily share it with friends, family, business partners, or customers.. It’s easy to set up, it’s compact and quiet when printing and to top if off, the print quality is excellent. This is hands down the best printer I’ve used for printing labels.. Brainstorming, innovation, problem solving, and negotiation have all become much more productive and valuable if people can easily collaborate in real time with minimal friction.. The print quality also does not disappoint, it’s clear, bold, doesn’t smudge and the text is perfectly sized..

Alcatel A3 XL: Budget-friendly smartphone with a massive 6-inch display. TCL released a new phone under the Alcatel brand, the Alcatel A3 XL. A budget-friendly device packed with a massive 6-inch display priced USD 200.. TCL, the phone manufacturer that now owns the Alcatel brand, wants to keep up with the budget-conscious consumers nowadays. Hence the release of a new phablet phone from the Alcatel A-series smartphones. The latest device was unveiled at the CES dubbed as the Alcatel A3 XL. The company describes this as the 'new premium range of affordable mobile devices,' thus, stating their ultimate goal of producing budget-friendly devices without compromising its quality and functionality.. The Alcatel A3 XL sports a massive 6-inch IPS display (which seems to be its selling point) perfect for eBook lovers. However, it comes with a not so high resolution of just 1280 x 720 pixels. It is powered by a quad-core MediaTek MT8735B processor clocked at 1.1GHz accompanied by 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage which can be expanded up to 32GB via a microSD card. Camera wise, the phone features an 8-megapixel main snapper and a 5-megapixel front-facing shooter. While in the OS department, the Alcatel A3 XL will run on Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box backed by a 3000mAh battery.. Looking at its slow processor and small RAM, we can say that this will affect the overall performance of the device. But even though its specs may be somewhat disappointing, it still has something to boast about. It comes with a fingerprint scanner, and it's not your typical type either. It has a multi-purpose rear fingerprint sensor doubling as a way to encrypt documents, answer calls and more; surely a good thing for consumers.. Alcatel A3 XL is said to be released in the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America in the first quarter of 2017 whereas, in Europe, it will be made in the second quarter. There's no word on the US release. However, pricing is said to be approximately USD 200; an affordable price indeed.. User Review : 1 Reviews. The very nice to this phone is that it has a v7.0 Nougat operating system that can be also upgraded into new ... Write a review on this product. Read more reviews on this product.

This is a fully-functional phone and while it's not suited to elaborate VR apps, everything else is very usable (once loaded). The front camera is average but that's really the only downside. We actually really like the screen with its bright colours and large text/icons - it's comfortable to use and one of the best on the market for those with poor eyesight.

This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. The former French manufacturer of telecommunication equipment merged to Alcatel-Lucent in 2006. Several business segments were sold to other companies, so the Alcatel brand is now used by various companies. The Chinese company TCL uses the brand names "Alcatel One Touch" and "Alcatel Idol" for smartphones and tablets.. The market share in the smartphone + tablet segment is very small, but there are quite some recent reviews in different languages. The ratings are average (as of 2016)..
