CNET también está disponible en español.. Huawei Honor 8 Pro review:. Near-flagship quality without the flagship price. The Good The Huawei Honor 8 Pro packs a neat dual-lens camera, a great screen and plenty of power.. The Bad Battery life is disappointing and no waterproofing means that you'll need to be extra careful when using your phone around clumsy friends holding drinks.. The Bottom Line The Huawei Honor 8 Pro's great specs and affordable price make it a worthy option if you want high-end features without emptying your bank account.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. The Huawei Honor 8 Pro brings you much of the power and capabilities you'd expect of a high-end flagship phone, but with a UK price of £474 ( direct from Huawei ), it comes in cheaper than most other premium handsets. That converts to roughly $610 or AU$820, but there's no word yet on US or Australian availability.. Let's start with the all-metal body, which most phones now sport. My review model has an attractive cool blue finish, with glass that curves gently at the sides. There's an accurate fingerprint scanner mounted on the back that's easy to reach when you pick up the phone.. The display? A 5.7-inch, 2,560x1,440-pixel panel that's pin-sharp and kicks out extremely rich, vivid colours. That's the same screen resolution you'll find on the much pricier Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ) and Google Pixel XL. Diving deeper, the powerful octa-core processor easily handles the demanding gameplay in Riptide GP: Renegade and photo editing in Snapseed. There's also a hearty 64GB of storage and, yes, you can expand that with a microSD card, up to 128GB in size.. There are two 12-megapixel cameras on the back, with one shooting in colour and the other in black and white -- it's a similar setup to what you'll see on on Huawei's P10. Colour shots are generally well exposed, with strong hues, while the rich contrast from the monochrome sensor means your artsy black and white snaps are Instagram-ready without any additional tweaking.. The Honor's colour shots have much higher contrast and saturation than the Galaxy S8's, which can make them look a little unnatural. If you want the most accurate lighting and colour in your shots, go for the S8, but the Honor will suit you well if you want punchy snaps from the beach to share with your friends immediately.. Huawei Honor 8 Pro example photos. If you love taking selfies, the 8-megapixel camera on the front does a great job of capturing your face, with natural colours and enough resolution to make you and your friends' grinning faces stand out. There's a beauty mode, too, which smooths out and brightens your skin if you're feeling particularly self-conscious. Mercifully, you can alter the amount of "beauty" it applies -- at full whack, you'll come out looking a bit like a porcelain doll.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News. Homeland Security's tall order: A hacker-free election. 'Annihilation' director wove memory into a dream-like movie. Dogecoin: The joke cryptocurrency that was too real for its own good.

Honor’s found the recipe for success with the 8 Pro. Honor has found a winner with the 8 Pro, delivering a high-performing phone at exactly the right price.. Honor has found a winner with the 8 Pro, delivering a high-performing phone at exactly the right price.. Honor has found a winner with the 8 Pro, delivering a high-performing phone at exactly the right price.. Excellent bokeh mode on dual-lens camera. Slick interface, too many pre-installed apps. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. is a phone we should talk about more. It’s good looking, has a good camera, and doesn’t cost much at $250. It embodies what Honor, a brand that shares technology with Huawei, does best. But what happens when Honor goes all-out and creates a phone with high-end specifications, ready to take on Huawei Mate 9 , and other big-screen phones like the LG G6 , and Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 ?. The Honor 8 Pro — technically adept, while still reasonably priced. It does almost everything well, though the phone’s camera is a little lackluster compared to competitors, and it’s not eye-catching like the Galaxy S8.. We’ve spent a week with it, and this is what we found.. While immediate comparisons will be drawn with the iPhone 7 Plus, the Honor 8 Pro is closer to the new Huawei P10 Plus. in design, right down to the placement of the buttons and the microphone, to the shape and curvature of the body. Meet them going down the street, and you’d think they were twins.. The body is made from aluminum, which has a very pleasant soft textured touch to it, and the large 5.7-inch screen is covered by a 2.5D curved Gorilla Glass 3. The fingerprint sensor is on the back — its main deviation from the Huawei P10 Plus. — because it uses on-screen Android navigation buttons. It’s comfortable to hold, but it’s slippery. The rear also attracts nasty smudges if your hands are anything other than squeaky clean.. It’s essentially the same overall size as the iPhone 7 Plus, and comes close to matching the Mate 9. It’s almost impossible to stretch your thumb across the display, so you’ll regularly use two hands, or resort to Honor’s software and fingerprint sensor tricks to make the phone usable with one hand. But the phone’s size doesn’t affect its placement of the rear fingerprint sensor — unlike the Galaxy S8 Plus. The Honor 8 Pro rarely required me to shift my finger around to reach the sensor immediately. What helps is how the phone is unbelievably thin at less than 7mm.. The phone is unbelievably thin at less than 7mm.. While the Pro will come in black or gold, we love the blue variant. It’s great to see a colorful alternative to the usual black, white, and golds we usually get to choose from. It’s not “dazzling,” like the blue Huawei uses on the P10 , but is considerably more matte and extends all over the phone, so you don’t have a white or a black bezel around the screen.. The Honor 8 Pro isn’t a heart-pounding beauty, but it offers strong build quality, premium materials, and if you choose the blue, it nicely separates itself from other more generic smartphones.. The Honor 8 Pro isn’t exciting to look at, but the same can’t be said for its software experience. Android 7.0 Nougat with the EMUI 5.1 user interface on top, which will be familiar to anyone who has used, or followed our coverage of, the Huawei Mate 9. What was once a messy, often unpleasant piece of software, has become a coherent, slick, and attractive user interface over Android. Yes, some people will prefer regular Android, and for them, phones like the Pixel. Everyone else — those who buy Samsung, LG, HTC, or any other Android phone — will have no problem with EMUI 5.1. There’s even an option to add an app drawer, if spreading app icons across multiple home screens isn’t your thing.. Honor’s software brings a few extra features with it, including Knuckle Sense, where using a knuckle rather than a finger to draw shapes on the screen activates certain features. These include taking screenshots, or opening the music app. Honor also has a few ways to make the large phone easier to use with one hand. Minimizing Android to one corner is activated with a swipe across the menu, back, and home buttons, for example. The fingerprint sensor also has multiple uses — a swipe down drops the notification shade, and a left or right swipe in the gallery scrolls through your pictures.. There are too many pre-installed apps — Tripadvisor, Opera, booking.com , Asphalt Nitro, Huawei’s Vmall to name just a few — and SwiftKey is the default keyboard, which I find frustrating to use. Thankfully, the third-party apps can be uninstalled, and Gboard can be used instead of SwiftKey if you prefer.. Considering the Honor 8 Pro is internally very similar to the Mate 9 and P10 , both of which are solid, reliable phones, it’s no surprise to find it’s just as competent.. We played a variety of games, and all ran without a problem. We did find the phone got quite warm to the touch. Never too hot, but you certainly know when the octa-core Kirin 960 processor is working hard. It’s the same chip found in the Huawei Mate 9. and P10 , but in the Honor phone it’s backed up by 6GB of RAM, rather than 4GB. There’s 64GB of internal storage space, and a MicroSD card will fit in the tray alongside the SIM.. Putting the Honor 8 Pro through the AnTuTu 3D benchmark test returned a 143,237 score, slightly higher than the number achieved by the Mate 9 and the P10. Gaming performance using SlingShot Extreme on 3DMark returned a 1943 score, lower than the Mate 9 and the OnePlus 3T. Don’t read too much into these results though.. Inside the Honor 8 Pro is an almost unfeasibly massive battery for such a slim phone — 4,000mAh. We only had the phone for a week, but during that time a recharge was needed every two days, and that’s with comprehensive use. We got the similar results from the Huawei Mate 9 , but we’re disappointed that Huawei’s effective SuperCharge fast-charging system is missing on the Honor 8 Pro. Recharging stretched beyond 90 minutes and towards 120 minutes.. Any modern smartphone, flagship or not, needs a respectable camera. The big trend at the moment is for dual-lens cameras, and the Honor 8 Pro jumps aboard with a pair of 12-megapixel sensors. One shoots in color and the other in monochrome, and used together the phone can create a cool blurred background bokeh effect. This can be manipulated in the gallery after you take the shot.. If that sounds similar to the P10 Plus. and Mate 9 , then it should, but there are one or two key differences — Leica isn’t involved with the Honor phone, the aperture is smaller at f/2.2, and it doesn’t have the excellent Portrait mode introduced on the P10. In the right environment, the camera takes good pictures, but it tends to overexpose, and overcast skies get washed out. Colors don’t always pop the way we expected either.. It’s the same story in monochrome mode, and no amount of forcing the camera to adjust the aperture produced pictures we really adored. It’s close, and all the pictures were filled with detail; but we’d regularly turn to editing the images to get them just right — something many people won’t want to do. Low-light suffered too, especially without optical image stabilization.. The bokeh mode, or wide aperture as it’s called here, saves the day and is way more successful. It’s effortless to take the shot — just activate the mode with a single button — and it’s just as easy to change the focal point afterwards. The effect looks amazing, and generates something we always look for in cameras: creative inspiration. Once you get the hang of what looks good, you’ll be looking for opportunities to use the wide aperture mode more.. The camera app is intuitive, and easy to use. Swipe to the left or right to access menus, which have large, clearly labeled icons to guide you through the different modes. There’s a pro manual mode for stills and video — which can shoot up to 4K resolution — and modes for HDR, taking pictures at night, and shooting videos in slow motion. Swap to the front camera and you’ll take 8-megapixel selfies, and get to use the subtle beauty mode. Results are satisfactory, and improved when you play around with the solid image editing tools.. The small aperture lets the Honor 8 Pro’s camera down, which is unfortunate when elsewhere, it’s a strong performer producing pictures we want to share.. The 5.7-inch LCD screen has a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution, and it looks superb. It’s bright, colorful, and the details are pin sharp. But because it’s not an AMOLED panel, Google won’t certify the Honor 8 Pro for Daydream VR use. Not to worry, because the box that packs the Honor 8 Pro’s box actually turns into a VR viewer! Is it good? No, not really.. The Honor 8 Pro is hard to beat for the price.. The Honor 8 Pro comes with Jaunt VR’s app, which has some great content, and the viewer is pretty similar to other Google Cardboard viewers out there. But it doesn’t have a manual control button, so it won’t work with the Cardboard app, and bugs in the Jaunt VR app made life extra difficult. The only way to exit a movie was to remove the phone, reset the app, and start again.. Get the Jaunt VR app working and the experience will improve, and when we did get videos playing it looked fantastic on the high resolution screen. It’s a fun introduction to 360-degree video. It’s not a reason to buy the Honor 8 Pro, and you’d probably get more benefit from grabbing one of the many Cardboard headsets with an actual button on it.. The Honor 8 Pro hasn’t been announced for the U.S. at the time of writing, but is on sale in the U.K. In China, the 8 Pro is known as the Honor V9. It’s priced at 480 British pounds or 550 euros through the Vmall online store, which is about $590 depending on the exact exchange rate. This is more expensive than the majority of phones we see from Honor — the 6X is $250, for example. It also puts it right in-between some highly desirable hardware. It’s more expensive than the OnePlus 3T , but less than the Huawei Mate 9 , and the Huawei P10 Plus .. Huawei Honor 8 Pro Compared To. For the specification and its performance, the Honor 9 Pro is superb value for money. It has genuine flagship phone performance and features, for considerably less money than you’d expect. Honor would have to drastically adjust the price if the phone launches in the U.S., because the Huawei Mate 9 can be yours for $600 — and the camera’s ability makes it the better buy.. release date, we’ll have to quote the U.K. warranty details , which covers the phone for 24-months, the battery and charger for six months, and the included headphones for three months. If there is a problem you have to visit a registered Honor/Huawei service center, and you won’t be covered if the phone has taken a bath or damaged through misuse.. For once, spending less doesn’t mean making a compromise. The Honor 8 Pro’s dual-lens camera makes it trendy, the fast processor makes it usable, the massive screen looks great, and the battery is long-lasting. release date, and we’ll be very happy.. The Honor 8 Pro is hard to beat for the price in the U.K., where our three favourite dual-lens big-screen phones — the LG G6 , the Huawei P10 , and Huawei Mate 9. — both cost more than 600 British pounds. They’re better phones, but you’ll spend at least 150 British pounds more to get one in your hand. It’s toughest challenger is the OnePlus 3T. It has a smaller, lower resolution screen at 5.5-inches, but is a great looking phone with at least as much (if not more) power and performance. However, you’ll miss out on the dual-lens camera.. If you’re eyeing Huawei and are in the U.S., we’d recommend buying the Huawei Mate 9. instead given the outstanding price it’s available for, plus it comes with a U.S. Samsung 128GB 80MB/s EVO Select Micro SDXC memory card. The Honor 8 Pro isn’t water resistant, but the metal body is arguably more durable than a completely glass smartphone in the event of a fall. The device is very thin though, so we’d be careful about accidentally putting too much pressure on it in a pocket.. Honor, like Huawei, doesn’t have the best track record with Android updates. Our review model runs Android 7.0 Nougat and has the March 1, 2017 security patch installed, so it’s relatively close. How long that will remain the case isn’t certain. The only way to be sure of the latest Android software and patches is to buy a Google Pixel phone.. Otherwise, the Honor 8 Pro can be considered a flagship phone, and has more than enough power and ability to last for several years.. If you have a maximum budget of 500 British pounds (~$590), the Honor 8 Pro represents astonishing value, with better features than you’ll find on phones at or around the same price. Its build quality as well as the software experience are also excellent. We don’t suggest importing one to the U.S.. Instead, wait to see if Honor announces a U.S. version, or just opt for the Huawei Mate 9.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

CNET también está disponible en español.. Huawei Honor 8 Pro boasts two cameras, two-day battery life (hands-on).

And two cameras on the back?. Add the Huawei Honor 8 Pro to your list. The unlocked 5.7-inch handset is an upper-midrange phone that comes with some impressive hardware specs. Its most compelling features: the dual-camera setup on the back and the 4,000mAh battery, which Huawei says will last more than a full day and closer to two.. It runs on Huawei's latest home-made octa-core processor, along with a hearty 6GB of RAM, and so far in our testing seems more than competent.. Picturing the Huawei Honor 8 Pro's dual cameras. The big battery means the phone is chunky to hold, but the solid metal build makes it feel like one of the more premium devices Honor has launched. The navy-blue hue of our review model looks great, too, and the way the glass screen curves at the edge to meet the body is a nice touch. The fingerprint sensor on the back works well and you can swipe your finger over it to browse photos or bring up the notification panel.. In terms of images, the Honor 8 has a similar setup to Huawei's P10 -- one 12-megapixel sensor takes photos in colour, while the other shoots only in black and white. We really liked the artistic quality of the black and white shots on the P10 and while the P10's cameras have higher resolutions, we're hoping the Honor will deliver similarly satisfying results.. You can preorder the Honor 8 Pro on April 5 in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. It'll cost £475 or 549 euros, which converts to roughly $585 or AU$770, with no word yet on US or Australian availability.. 2.5GHz + 1.8GHz octa-core Huawei Kirin 960. 2.5GHz + 1.8GHz octa-core Huawei Kirin 960.

Sony Xperia XZ2 embraces curves, haptics and 4K HDR. Galaxy S9 price details: Verizon, T-Mobile, unlocked, more [Updated]. Huawei MateBook X Pro hides pop-up webcam in svelte 3k laptop. How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. JC Torres - Apr 5, 2017. Just when you thought you’ve seen all the Android flagships that this half of 2017 has to offer, along comes Honor to blow your presumptions away. Many might brush off this Huawei sub-brand because it is, well, a sub-brand. That, however, would be a grave mistake with the Honor 8 Pro. Because as far as this latest Honor flagship is concerned, it could have been called the “Huawei P10 Plus Lite”. Which is to say, it’s pretty darned impressive. Especially for something that comes well under this year’s high-end smartphone prices.. A lot of consumers will knock the Honor 8 Pro off for looking like an iPhone knock off. Admittedly, that impression might be warranted. You have the same soft curves on the edges and the same all-metal unibody build. It even has the very conspicuous antenna lines though, thankfully, not as bad as the iPhone 6 and 6s.. There are subtle differences, of course, and the biggest one is the rear camera bump. Or rather, the lack of it. Despite being only 6.97 mm thin, Honor has seemingly done the impossible and made the camera bump disappear. What you get is one, flat, continuous rear what won’t rock when placed on a flat surface.. You’d be doing yourself a great disservice if you stopped at how the Honor 8 Pro looked. If you manage to get past the all too familiar surface, you’ll discover a treasure trove of features you’d only find in more expensive smartphones this time of year.. Calling the Honor 8 Pro a “Lite” version of Huawei’s P10 Plus is actually not too far-fetched. Actually the Honor 8 Pro is larger than the P10 Plus, so we can’t really call it “mini” either. But for almost all intents and purposes, the two are eerily similar, give or take a few misses.. With the Honor 8 Pro, the company is jumping onto the QHD bandwagon at long last. Previous models would settle for 1080p Full HD, even at 5.7 inches like this one. It is powered by the latest Kirin 960, the very same processor inside both the Huawei P10 and the P10 Plus. There’s also an 8 megapixel front camera, exactly like those other two.. Of course, there are differences as well, and, quite surprisingly, for the better. Unlike the Huawei P10 Plus, for example, the Honor 8 Pro only has one memory configuration: 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB of expandable storage. And also unlike the P10 Plus, the Honor 8 Pro has a larger 4,000 mAh battery that’s promised to last even longer but still charge just as fast. Here’s a rundown of those juicy numbers:. • Operating System: Android 7.0 Nougat, EMUI 5.1. • CPU: Huawei Kirin 960, octa-core 4×2.4 GHz + 4×1.8 GHz. • Storage: 64 GB, expandable up to 128 GB. • Display: 5.7 inches, 2560×1440 QHD (515 ppi). • Main Camera: 12 MP + 12 MP f/2.2. • Secondary Camera: 8 MP f/1.9. • Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, 2.4 GHz/5 GHz, Bluetooth 4.2, micro USB, 3.5 mm headphone jack. • Battery: 4,000 mAh, fast charging. • Dimensions: 157 x 77.5 x 6.97 mm. The bottom line here is that the Honor 8 Pro is almost, blow for blow, equal to the Huawei P10 Plus, which is no slouch in any department. The Kirin 960 is one of the underestimated powerhouses in the mobile processor market, and Huawei’s EMUI 5.1 promises even more performance optimizations on the software side.. Of course, the Honor 8 Pro isn’t the Huawei P10 Plus, so something, other than the design, has to be different. Or to put it bluntly, worse. Sadly, that comes down to the cameras, but it isn’t as bad as it sounds.. Huawei has found its calling in dual camera smartphones and that DNA has naturally been inherited by is sub-brand as well. Unfortunately, it couldn’t inherit everything (otherwise, it would be a clone, wouldn’t it?). Some things, like a privileged contract with famed camera maker Leica, are reserved for the bigger brand.. Here, the Honor 8 Pro had to settle for a bit less. Instead of the P10 Plus’ massive dual 20 megapixel f1/.8 sensors, the Honor 8 Pro only gets a 12 megapixel f/2.2 combo, almost similar to last year’s Huawei P9. There is no trace of Leica here, however, which would give some more professional mobile photographers pause for thought.. In practice, however, the Honor 8 Pro still packs quite a punch in this aspect, better than its rivals on this tier. Photos, especially in bright light, are bright and colors are quite vivid. With the right manual settings, you can get near-professional output without having broken your bank account. Of course, there are tons of modes and features that ad a bit of flavor to your photos and videos, like the now common Beauty mode. The “wide aperture mode” is probably going to give the most interesting effect, blurring the background for a bokeh effect.. Naturally, it has its shortcomings, especially in handling less than ideal lighting situations. Then again, even the Huawei P10 Plus, with its f/1.8 aperture, sometimes falters there. What chance does an f/2.2 has then? And unlike the P10 or P10 Plus, the Honor 8 Pro’s front camera doesn’t have extra features to boast of. It’s not bad, definitely, but nothing to fall head over heels either.. The Honor 8 Pro is definitely one of the unexpected surprises of the smartphone market this year. You would have never expected that Honor, whose smartphones so far have been on the far side of mid-range, would come so close to Huawei’s own flagship while still remaining within reach for many consumers. That translates to around 500 EUR, roughly $540, still well below the $700-800 tags on this year’s premium handsets.. It’s not perfect, mind you, but it gets damned close, especially for that price. Sure, you won’t get FullVisions or Infinity Displays, Quad DACs or even Leica lenses. But you still get a solid performing smartphone with a very acceptable camera at a bargain. You might call it the “poor man’s Huawei P10 Plus” or even the “iPhone 7 Plus for Android fans”, but don’t let that prevent you from seeing what the Honor 8 Pro truly is: one of if not the most formidable Android smartphones to hit the market this year..

Huawei Honor 8 Pro review: A feature packed mid-ranger that challenges the OnePlus 5. 8 Pro, the successor to its previous. 8 handset that arrived in India last year. The handset is priced at Rs 29,999 and features a new design, gets rid of the glass back and goes in for a polished, all-metal build that looks unique. even feels better in comparison to the current smartphone alternatives in its class.. With that said, Huawei through its. brand has gotten rather competitive after realising how close it came to competing with the OnePlus 3 last year.. This time around, the brand has worked on its weaker points, and now seems to have delivered a much more competitive offering that clearly has the OnePlus 5 in its crosshairs.. Going by the specifications, on paper, the. 8 Pro sure has an edge over the OnePlus despite packing in its homegrown Kirin 960 chipset. in comparison with the OnePlus 5's. a larger battery and a much better QHD LCD display, among other features; but do these features result in a better handset in comparison to the OnePlus 5?. Has Huawei beaten the OnePlus 5 at its own game? I think it has.. on the design this time as well. To many, it may not look too different, but you really need to hold one in your hands to experience. the quality and effort the design team has put into the 8 Pro.. Huawei skipped on the glass back and went in for an all-metal build this year. While it looks like your typical smartphone from afar,. it is well polished when held up close. The OnePlus 5, its arch rival looks, like an. the lack of attention to details, the OnePlus 5 does not stand a chance against the. The design is understated at best and features rounded corners.. The machining process is top notch and very unlike the OnePlus 5 that has some really sharp edges. The front features a 2.5D Gorilla Glass that. when you slide your finger from the sides of the smartphone to the display.. Flip it over the rear and you can see what is now no longer the highlight of the device, its dual cameras (everyone else has one too, these days). What is interesting about this layout is how Huawei has managed to fit two cameras sitting flush with the rest of the back.. Move your finger over the camera and will not be able to tell where it is located, because there is no camera bump.. The finish on the back does get scratched easily.. Those who love typing with their phones. placed on a table, will be happy to see a phone that does not wobble thanks to all those protruding cameras on the back.. There’s a dual LED flash that also sits. flat with the rest of the back with millimetre precision.. Other details on the back include the two. plastic inserts for the antennas (since this is an all-metal build) and a fingerprint reader on the back that unlocks the device rather quickly.. just 6.9 mm thick, which is impressive and feels thinner than Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and the. If you are a OnePlus user, you will be blown away by the quality of smartphone. Coming from another Honor device, you would already expect smartphones. with this level of detail at the given price.. Even with a design that can easily compete with flagship smartphones,. the best is yet to come.. fell short with its Kirin 950, Huawei’s new Kirin 960 takes charge on the 8 Pro, one that comes close to competing with flagships.. There a 5.7-inch Quad HD (2560x1440 pixels). that that delivers a 73.6 percent screen to body ratio. The QHD resolutions deliver a stunning 515 PPI that should do well when it comes to mobile VR use.. a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 screen that should be good enough to protect it from bumps and drops.. very own, HiSilicon Kirin 960 chipset which packs in 4x 2.4 GHz Cortex-A73 cores and 4x 1.8 GHz Cortex-A53 cores. There is also an additional i6 core that takes over. fitness data, while sipping very little power. This is analogous to the motion co-processor on Apple's iPhone chips.. As with the Honor 8, Huawei has once again gone in for a dual camera setup that features two 12 MP sensors. One camera reads RGB data while the second reads black and white data, both work together to deliver better image quality and great-looking bokeh in images. The rear camera setup also features laser AF. when combined, help the camera focus rather quickly.. The front facing camera is a humbler 8 MP unit, but oddly, comes with an f/2.0 aperture.. There’s 6 GB of RAM along with 128 GB of internal storage. Huawei also lets you expand that internal storage using the hybrid SIM tray which accepts a microSD card of up to 256 GB.. The handset runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box with Huawei’s revamped. is supposed to run smarter and even uses machine learning to keep the system running lag free.. (Wi-Fi Direct, hotspot included) Bluetooth v 4.2,. GPS, NFC, an Infrared port and a USB. 2.0 Type-C reversible connector with USB On-The-Go (OTG) support.. The handset is powered by a large 4,000 mAh battery which should deliver some good numbers despite the power hungry 5.7-inch QHD display.. The Huawei Honor 8 Pro features a 5.7-inch Quad HD LTPS IPS LCD display. The display fares well in direct sunlight with no viewing problems whatsoever. PPI means that this will not just deliver ultra sharp text in the smallest. text display settings possible, but also deliver good results when it comes to mobile VR headsets. Indeed, this is one area that OnePlus 5 does not stand a chance or does not even come close.. The colours are accurate, unlike most cheaper AMOLED displays out there, which. Viewing angles are great with no shift in. It is one of the few handsets that I came across. this year in the mid-range that stands up to Apple’s iPhone displays.. The colours were a tad bit cooler, but this can be adjusted in the 'Display settings' under 'Colour temperature'.. Unlike past EMUI skins that looked pretty while trying to balance out performance, EMUI 5.1 not only looks good but performs better as well.. At the private preview yours truly attended, Huawei explained that they did spend plenty of time on software and the results, from what I have experienced for more than a week, are quite visible. the EMUI now uses machine learning to clean up cache and will automatically figure out. which apps it will need to close (when not used) or prioritise others with a performance boost when needed.. I did not comes across any lag, including when launching, closing or switching between third-party apps.. only area where I did notice a slight stutter was when scrolling through the app drawer. But most will not notice this because the app drawer needs to be enabled; it's. Unlike the translucent interface we have seen from Huawei in the past, the new. UI feels polished and flawless and goes with a spartan white theme with a blue accent colour. Everything looks fresh and modern and Huawei claims that the new OS has been designed to get the user to any of its internal settings with just 3 taps. LG's famed WebOS concept aimed for the same.. Coming to customisations, there are plenty. One can download themes, wallpapers, ringtones, fonts and more from the theme store which is. filled to the brim with plenty of selections.. Apart from the usual Huawei apps there is also a revamped. HiGame app, a new Health app and an enhanced. Thanks to its updated processor, the Huawei Honor 8 Pro comes pretty close to. competing with devices in its segment, and those above it as well.. Benchmarks showed scores that were rather competitive and came eerily. close to the premium flagship territory, which is good news for buyers who are looking for performance at a price.. The Snapdragon 835 and even the Snapdragon 821 clearly have an edge over the Kirin 960. You can run every possible game at the highest graphics settings without any stutter or skipped frames. Whether its Asphalt Xtreme , Real Racing 3 or even casual titles like Mekorama and the like, the phone barely warmed up while playing games. when using the camera app outdoors and in direct sunlight.. The app however did not shut down in any of the above mentioned situations.. This chart clearly highlights the vast improvement in multi-core performance that this generation of mobile platforms has enabled. Mobile gamers will be more than happy to know that the Honor 8 Pro supports Vulcan. graphics, which should deliver a performance boost when it. comes to gaming, provided the developer supports it. However, as you can see from the charts below, the Kirin 960 is clearly not as effective a gaming platform as the Snapdragon 835 and even the older Snapdragon 821. However, as mentioned earlier, there's still more than enough performance on tap, so there is no noticeable performance difference in real-world usage.. The Snapdragon's Adreno GPU has long had an edge over the competition in graphically intensive applications. Audio quality using a standard pair of headphones was decent and. delivered plenty of depth while balancing out the treble and bass. Call quality was top notch as well, with no dropped calls and conversations being clear at both ends.. The Kirin 960 clearly can't keep up with the Snapdragons in the graphics department. loud and clear, which is something that one rarely finds in smartphones at this price point.. Most of the time I did not feel the need to plug in my headphones while playing intensive games, which is commendable.. Huawei includes the same old 12 MP sensors from the Honor 8 which again deliver similar levels of quality and sharpness as before. The phone, thanks to its laser AF combined with PDAF. You can tone down or turn up details like. Saturation, Brightness and Contrast to your liking by heading into the 'Image Adjustment' setting in the camera app.. The camera tends to overexpose images in brightly lit scenarios, so you will need to turn on the HDR mode manually whenever the setting is. There were even scenarios where some photographs, like the ones shot near a lake (in the sample album) that showed flat textures even in brightly lit conditions.. Indeed, this is not the Leica-branded stuff you will get on the P9 or the P10 smartphones,. but the results were good enough. lets you click pictures in black and white, are the best I have seen to date. These were expected as Huawei is one. that actually use a monochrome camera setup.. The images are not the result of a software filter, but true monochrome. inputs coming straight from the sensor.. hardware monochrome output can be used in the Pro or Manual mode. You will have to click the images in Auto and then open the Gallery app, which will let you tweak the photos.. The feather selection is pretty accurate and easily delivers the exceptional. bokeh when compared to other smartphones, both in its class and even compared to the Samsung Galaxy S8 (which only has a single camera on the back). The OnePlus 5 fails terribly in this area.. Still, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus performs better. than the Honor 8 pro, but the former is also priced at quite a premium.. While daylight shooting scenarios were fine, switching to low light or dimly lit settings results in images that were not exactly up to the mark. In auto mode (which is how most will use the camera) the. camera showcased blotchy images with no details. The luminance noise levels were just too high and the algorithms try and suppress the noise, killing all the details in the process.. The results in these scenarios are pretty bad, with most images looking like paintings, with no details whatsoever. whether you click them with rear camera or the front camera.. The camera software could do with a tweak to. its image processing, so these problems might. be resolved with a single software update. But for now, this is not a camera you would. want to use in low light scenarios, forget night scenes.. Coming to video, the Honor 8 Pro records great. 720p, 1080p, 1080p@60 and 4K in daylight. is smooth and looks great in daylight. In low light, I'd rather keep this phone in my pocket as the results are terrible. It's clear that Huawei’s software team needs to take a look. It could also be that the chipset is simply incapable of handling that much processing.. The Honor 8 Pro packs in a 4,000 mAh battery. While this may seem like plenty for most handsets these days, the Honor indeed had other hardware features that almost convinced me that it would not last too long.. Despite featuring a great Quad HD display that measures 5.7-inches diagonally and a Kirin chipset that is manufactured using the 16 nm process, the smartphone fared surprisingly well.. a good nine hours of battery life using our standard 'PCMark Work 1.0 Battery Life' test with the brightness set to 50 percent. In day-to-day usage, I did not feel the need to plug in the 8 Pro, because there would be sufficient charge left inside. that could get me through the first half of the second work day.. Clearly, its Huawei’s software optimisation at work and the results are great despite the fact that. it has pixel-rich QHD LCD display.. Among the power saving settings I also found a switch that would run the smartphone at lower resolution, giving it an extra hour of battery life in day to day usage.. As for the charging, Huawei claims that the Honor 8 Pro comes with a quick charging facility, but we could not test this out since. the company did not include the charger nor the cable in the box. Using the OnePlus 5’s Dash charger, it took a few hours to. get to 100 percent, which is painfully long. But once it's charged, there’s little to be worried about as the device can get you through a whole work day and more without breaking sweat.. Launched at Rs 29,999 with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB internal storage, there's really not much to complain about with the Huawei Honor 8 Pro. It defeats the value for money offerings from OnePlus and defeats the OnePlus 5 at its own game with a refined design, 4,000 mAh battery and even that QHD display.. The downside is the camera's low light performance that delivers noisy images and a possible performance gap when compared to the OnePlus 5. Thankfully, the performance gap is not noticeable in real-world usage and the camera issues might be fixed in a software update.. Overall, the only other smartphones that comes close is the OnePlus 3T that currently retails on Amazon at Rs 29,999. At that price you get a processor that is half a year old, a smaller battery, a Full HD display and. Also available is the smartphone that goes big on everything, the Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro, which. packs in a massive display and a big battery. However, considering the competition in this space, the C9 Pro's. Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 belongs more towards the budget lineup than the mid-range.. Lastly, there's the Oppo F3 Plus , but it too features a slower chipset and only 4 GB RAM.. Clearly, Huawei has done its homework and put up an offering with the right. specifications at a rather low price. The only area where the OnePlus can take it down is software (it's already on Android 7.1.1) and better low light images. For everything else, the Huawei certainly does a better job and delivers the same at a much lower price.. While buyers who earlier looked up to OnePlus can now also look at Huawei, both smartphones do cater to different audiences. The OnePlus 5 is clearly for the tweakers who love the install custom ROMs. But if you are not into that stuff, you do need to take one long, hard look at the Honor 8 Pro that delivers some serious bokeh effects and some mind-blowing black and white imagery and some better hardware. yet to put up our OnePlus 5 review, it is easy to say that it is going to get some serious competition from Huawei's Honor brand this year.. The Huawei Honor 8 Pro features a 5.7-inch Quad HD display with a resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels and is powered by a 4x2.4GHz + 4x1.8GHz octa core processor and has 6GB of RAM. It comes with 128GB of inbuilt storage and has a 12.0+12.0 megapixel rear camera and 8.0-megapixel front camera. It comes with Android 7.0 Nougat OS and support a 4000mAh battery capacity with 3G & 4G.. 157 x 77.5 x 7 mm. Music Format: MP3, eAAC+, WAV, Flac.

They nerfed it a bit with one of their updates when people reported issues, but for me it worked excellent with out of the box android version. You seem to be a very conservative user and it should get through the day fine. Since you are saying it's an upgrade I suggest going through other phones too because h8pro is very late 2016 to early 2017 type. What I like about this phone is its 2k screen(allows 2k youtube videos). Just too good wonder why next models 9 and 10 are sidegrades.

Huawei Honor 8 Pro April 5, 2017. Price $463 (expected in the US). Huawei’s sub-brand Honor is slowly emerging as one of the best contenders in the mid-range segment. Honor’s previous devices have witnessed good responses in countries like India and China. The recently launched flagship from Honor, the Honor 8 Pro, is getting a lot of positive feedback from users in the regions where it has been launched. Many are comparing the phone with the recently launched OnePlus 5 (priced at $479) and in fact, believe that the Honor 8 Pro is better than the OnePlus 5 regarding performance and pricing.. The Honor 8 Pro was launched at £474.99 in the UK (in April, 2017). It was later unveiled in India for Rs. The company is yet to announce the availability and pricing for the phone in the US, but we are pretty sure that its pricing will be in line with the other regions..

We decided to test the device ourselves and see if it is the flagship killer that we have been waiting for in the mid-range segment. But before going into the details, here’s the complete specs list of this. The Honor 8 Pro comes with a metal unibody and is available in two colors – Midnight Black and Navy Blue. We got our hands on the Midnight Black variant of the phone. The device features a sleek body with curved edges and measuring 6.97mm in thickness.. Surprisingly, even with this sleek and compact body, the phone managed to house a 4000mAh battery. We won’t say that the phone is lightweight, but it is not bulky and weighs just around 184 grams. It feels good to hold the Honor 8 Pro, but it can be a bit slippery (not as much as the glass-bodied Honor 8, though).. Related Huawei P20 Plus Case Renders Reveal Improved Smartphone Photography Prowess Thanks to Three Rear-Mounted Lenses. On the front, there is a 5.7-inch Low-Temperature PolySilicon (LTPS) 2K display with thin bezels on the side. There is an 8MP front-camera sensor on top of the front panel alongside earpiece and other sensors. On the right side, it has the volume rocker and a power button. The left side houses the SIM slot and at the bottom of the panel we have a USB Type-C port and the 3.5mm audio jack.. The display panel on the Honor 8 Pro looks gorgeous and is resistant to scratches. The colors are vivid and visible even in bright daylight, but if you don’t like too much brightness on the screen, then you can use the “color comfort mode” that’s available in the settings menu. If the 5.7-inch screen is too big for you to handle, then you can also enable one-hand usability mode by swiping left on the navigation panel on the main screen.. With a resolution of 1440×2560 pixels, the Honor 8 Pro is a perfect fit for pairing with a VR headset.. Talking about the VR headset, Huawei has thrown in a gimmick: there is a rectangular DIY VR headset that you will find inside the phone’s box, which is paired with the main box to create a complete VR box. Similar to other cardboard VR headsets, this one also works quite well.. Coming to the performance of the Honor 8 Pro, we were quite impressed with Huawei’s HiSilicon Kirin 960 chipset. Paired with 6GB of RAM and 128GB internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD card), we got flagship level performance. We used the phone for a week (loaded it with apps and games, performed exhaustive multitasking) throughout all the activities, the Honor 8 Pro didn’t disappoint us and delivered seamless task execution.. We also ran a few benchmark tests on the Honor 8 Pro, wherein it scored well. On AnTuTu, the phone scored 117,459 that is on the level of any device powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 or 821 chipset, but the score is slightly less when you compare it with phones running Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 chipset. The difference in score is also due to the 16nm fabrication on the HiSilicon Kirin 960 chipset, which is lower than the 10nm fabrication of the Snapdragon 835 SoC but close to the 14nm Snapdragon 821 SoC.. recent allegations on OnePlus 5 for tampering with benchmark scores, we can’t really compare Honor 8 Pro with OnePlus 5 on the basis of benchmark graphs.. We played games like Asphalt 8: Airborne on the phone and the experience was fine. The graphics were on the point, but it should be noted that after 20 to 25 minutes, the back panel of the device started heating up. High thermal levels made us wonder if the phone is only good for multitasking and not continuous gaming. Also, there is no waterproofing on the phone, which means that one has to be careful when using the device in the rainy season or near a pool. Not a deal breaker in this price range.. The Honor 8 Pro runs Huawei’s proprietary EMUI 5.1 overlay that is a based on Android 7.0 Nougat. Being a customized UI, Huawei has thrown in some extra features that one can’t find on stock Android. There is a built-in voice control feature in the phone that answers to the phrase ‘Dear Honor’ and comes handy when you can’t find your phone. When you say the phrase loudly, the phone responds with a loud noise and flickering flashlight, which makes it easy to spot the phone. Besides, there are some built-in power saving features, such as the Power Saving mode which restricts background apps usage. There is also a Screen Power Saving option that lowers the screen resolution so that your phone’s battery can last longer. Of course, there are some totally unnecessary preloaded apps on the phone but the good thing is that you can delete them.. This is the segment where the Honor 8 Pro truly shines. The dual-lens camera setup on the rear with a pair of 12MP, dual-tone LED flash, and f/2.2 aperture, autofocus. The camera offers great performance in most conditions. Shutter lag is low, and the final picture comes out in the best quality. Given its pricing, the Honor 8 Pro’s camera can compete with the flagships like the HTC U11. The pictures clicked are bright, sharp, and in the right color tone.. There are many modes in the camera app (as you can see in the pictures) such as Monochrome, Pro, and more. The Honor 8 Pro comes with independent RGB and monochrome sensors rather than the telephoto lens that we have seen on other flagships. Huawei claims that the monochrome sensor captures more light, which results in better monochrome shots. Among the many modes available in the camera app of the phone, the Pro mode is great for taking still shots and videos.. By default, the camera app adds the “Honor 8 Pro” watermark to the images, but you can remove it by going into the settings of the app. Regarding the 4K video recording, there was lag during the recording but the final output was not affected by it.. The battery performance of the device in heavy usage is not that great but isn’t too bad either. For the initial testing, we used the phone extensively and it still managed to last us for a day. The 5.7-inch display and the QHD resolution sucked most of the power during the usage along with some battery sucking apps. On low usage, the phone’s battery can last for more than a day, but not as much as you’d expect from the mammoth-sized battery.. The great thing is that the phone supports quick charging, which means it can go from 0% to 100% in under a couple of hours.. The QHD display comes across as the primary reason for weak battery performance.. Overall, the Honor 8 Pro is a great device in its tier and might just prove itself to be a OnePlus 5 killer. Many have compared it to the high-end flagship phones thanks to its sleek looks and a power-packed specs list, and the device is an absolute. rockstar in the mid range smartphone market.. The phone is suitable for everyday work and handles multitasking pretty smoothly. Camera performance is on point too, but battery life could have been made a tad bit better along with the addition of waterproof coating. The one segment that the Honor 8 Pro might not be able to seduce is the gaming community. At least our test unit experienced heating issues after prolonged gaming sessions. But, if you are looking for a phone with good performance, powerful features, high-end looks, and affordable price tag, Huawei Honor 8 Pro will make you happy.. Huawei's Honor 8 Pro justifies its price tag with its gorgeous looks, strong camera performance and powerful specifications. It emerges as a rival to the OnePlus 5 by offering similar specs and performance at a lower price tag. An ideal buy for photography aficionados who want powerful specs on a phone without draining their savings.. Pros Amazing build and sleek design. Dual-lens camera setup does a swell job. Cons Tends to heat up during gaming.

Aditya Shenoy , 06 July 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Honor 8 Pro is powered by Huawei's Kirin 960 Processor. It has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and dual 12-megapixel rear cameras. It packs a 4000mAh battery in a relatively slim body. Honor 8 Pro design Honor 8 Pro specifications Honor 8 Pro software and performance Honor 8 Pro camera Verdict. Huawei has steadily been releasing devices in India under its sub-brand Honor. With this strategy, the brand has managed to place one of its devices in every price segment below Rs. The Honor 8 ( Review ) has been its top-of-the-line device so far, and now it looks like the Honor 8 Pro will take over that position. The Honor 8 Pro sports dual rear cameras and is priced to go up against the new kid on the block, the OnePlus 5 ( Review ). So does this phone have what it takes to dethrone one of the most popular models around? Let’s find out in our Honor 8 Pro review.. The design of the Honor 8 Pro is slightly different when compared to its sibling, the Honor 8. The older model has a glossy glass back, whereas the Honor 8 Pro gets a metal unibody. It's available in two colours, Midnight Black and Navy Blue, and you’ll be happy with either one. The smartphone is quite sleek, measuring just 6.97mm in thickness, and has curved sides. What is surprising is that Honor has managed to cram a 4000mAh battery into this body.. At the front, there's a 5.7-inch LTPS panel, with super-slim side borders. The top and bottom are thicker, and there's an Honor logo below the screen. Above it, you'll find the 8-megapixel selfie shooter along with the earpiece and a couple of sensors. The power and volume buttons are on the right side. The power button is well within reach but you might have to stretch a little to reach the volume controls. The left side of the Honor 8 Pro only has the SIM slot. Honor has placed the USB Type-C port and the 3.5mm headphone jack at the bottom, along with the loudspeaker and the primary microphone. At the top, there's a secondary microphone and a IR emitter which lets you control household appliances.. The highlight of the Honor 8 Pro, the dual rear cameras, are placed at the back in the upper left corner, along with a dual-tone LED flash. Unlike many other phones, both cameras are fitted flush with the body of the smartphone, under a glass window which should keep the lenses from picking up scratches. The fingerprint scanner is also at the back, and we found its placement to be a little higher than what would have been comfortable. You’ll have to stretch your finger a little or shuffle the device in your palm to reach the fingerprint scanner.. Honor ships this phone with only an 18W charger and USB cable, but the party trick is that the box itself can be converted into a cardboard-style VR headset. You get all the required materials, including the lenses, in the box.. The Honor 8 Pro has some impressive specifications. To start with, the 5.7-inch display has a Quad HD resolution, which translates to a dense 515 pixels per inch. The front panel is made of Corning Gorilla Glass for protection, with 2.5D curved edges. The display has punchy contrast and is quite vivid. Some users might not like the aggressive colour reproduction, and sadly, there is no way to tone it down. You can only tweak the colour temperature to suit your liking. You also get a night mode that claims to reduce strain on the eyes in low light. We liked watching videos on this display. The single speaker was loud enough, but we did feel that front-firing stereo speakers would have done better justice.. Huawei has used its own Kirin 960 SoC to power the Honor 8 Pro. It is an octa-core processor with four Cortex A73 cores running at 2.3GHz plus four Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.8GHz. This seems slightly dated when compared to the Snapdragon 835 which powers the OnePlus 5. The Honor 8 Pro gets 6GB of RAM along with 128GB of storage which is expandable using a microSD card in the hybrid SIM slot. We found that the firmware occupies close to 16GB of space on the phone, but we still had over 100GB free to use.. The phone also has Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi ac, and NFC. The Honor 8 Pro is a dual-SIM device with two Nano-SIM slots. There is support for 4G, VoLTE, and carrier aggregation.. Honor has the 8 Pro running on EMUI 5.1 which is a slightly newer version than what we saw on the Honor 8 Lite. The UI is based on Android 7.0 Nougat, and our unit also had the June security update installed. With 6GB of RAM at its disposal, the Honor 8 Pro had no issues when loading apps and games. Even when switching between apps, we found that the device would retain them in memory, reducing reload times. After a day of use we had over 3.5GB of RAM free on average, which is great.. You also get a one-handed mode which makes it easier to use this big device. Fingerprint scanner gestures let you pull down the notifications shade and dismiss notifications as well. There are a few apps from Honor that come preloaded, but you can uninstall most of the bloat.. The software has a few battery saving options baked in. There is Power Saving mode which limits background apps and disables auto-sync, as well as an Ultra Power Saving mode which switches everything off allowing connectivity only to apps you select. We also found a Screen Power Saving option, which claims to lower the resolution of the display to conserve power. We couldn’t see this taking effect as our device reported QHD as the resolution all the time.. There's a voice control feature built in which responds to the phrase ‘Dear Honor’. In case you can't find your phone, you can loudly ask the device where it is and it will respond by playing a loud tune and triggering the flashlight. You can also try using custom commands, but we found that this did not work most of the time, making the whole feature somewhat pointless.. We ran the Honor 8 Pro through a couple of benchmarks to see how it fares against the competition. The phone returned 124,151 in Antutu, as well as 1,877 and 6,222 in the single- and multi-core tests in Geekbench. It managed to push out 56 frames per second while running the T-Rex test in GFXBench. While the scores are good, devices based on the Snapdragon 835 including the OnePlus 5 performed better.. The phone lasted for 10 hours, 19 minutes in our HD video loop test, and we could get through a full day with medium use.. The highlight of the Honor 8 Pro is its dual 12-megapixel rear cameras. Unlike smartphones that have a telephoto lens on the second camera, these two are used as independent RGB and monochrome sensors. Honor claims that the monochrome sensor can absorb more light which results in better details. To leverage the hardware, Honor has built its own camera app that offers multiple modes to choose from.. While Auto mode is set by default, you can take control using the Pro mode for stills and video. You can also set it to monochrome mode which uses only the monochrome sensor to deliver a black-and-white image. We found that the phone would get warm when using the camera even though it managed to run cool at other times including when gaming.. The photos with this phone turned out really good, and details really were better than average. Colours were accurate and we did not find any chromatic aberration or purple fringing when shooting against the light. Macros were also impressive, and the phone managed a good amount of separation between subjects and backgrounds. In low light, we saw that the camera would sharpen images which improves visibility at the cost of noise and some loss of detail. Selfies were also good, and we noticed that the camera app smoothens them. By default, the camera app adds a watermark advertising the name of the phone. You can disable this, but the option is buried within the Settings menu. We hope this option isn’t turned out by default in the units that ship to the consumers.. The Honor 8 Pro can record video at 4K but the ability to continuous autofocus is lost at this resolution. You can switch to 1080p at 30 or 60fps to enable it. We found noticeable lag in the viewfinder while recording video and panning from side to side, but it does not affect the output.. Honor has built the Honor 8 Pro with the best technology it has to offer, which is at par with some of the best in the industry. The Kirin 960 processor is the most powerful silicon that Huawei currently makes, even though it falls behind the Snapdragon 835. The Honor 8 Pro also runs latest version of EMUI. Compared to the OnePlus 5, you get twice the storage and a higher resolution screen at an even lower price.. The camera performance is quite good and so is the implementation of the dual-camera functionality. The monochrome sensor does help and we were impressed with the level of detail in every picture. Overall, we were happy with the photos we took with the Honor 8 Pro.. It does seem as though the Honor 8 Pro is a good all-rounder. It might not be the leader of the pack but it isn’t far behind, and definitely looks like a much better deal than the slightly less expensive Samsung Galaxy C7 Pro ( Review ) and Moto Z2 Play ( Review ). For Rs 29,999, it is considerably more affordable than the OnePlus 5, potentially making it just as much of a flagship killer.. Editor's note: An earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that the Honor 8 Pro has an AMOLED display..

Tesla's electric trucks may be more cost-effective than expected. The Honor 8 Pro is Huawei's best flagship yet. Forget the P10 and buy this instead.. There's Huawei, and then there's Honor. While both are technically the same company, the Honor brand takes some of the best bits of Huawei's smartphones and packages them up in new devices that don't take as much of a bite out of your bank account. That's been the general distinction between the two, anyway, but the line has become blurrier as Honor has begun breaching the mid-range with smartphones like the Honor 8. And now, it's been all but scrubbed out with the announcement of the £475 (nearly $593) Honor 8 Pro today, which is every bit a new Huawei flagship.. Gallery: Honor 8 Pro hands-on | 19 Photos. Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Tucked away inside the Honor 8 Pro is Huawei's best homegrown chip: the Kirin 960 with four 2.4GHz cores and four 1.8GHz cores. With 6GB of RAM and 64 gigs of expandable storage backing that up, it's a beast by any account. It's also running the latest version of Huawei's EMUI (5.1), which is built on top of Android 7.0 Nougat. Among the improvements are a better blue light filter and new camera feature co-developed with GoPro called Highlights, which automatically creates video stories from what's available in the gallery (much like HTC's old Zoe highlights feature, then).. Like some other Huawei devices, the Honor 8 Pro uses machine learning to optimize performance, predicting your daily Facebook check so the app loads faster than it would do otherwise. Algorithms also promise to delay the inevitable slowdown of the device as file fragmentation and other forms of wear and tear take their toll. Apparently, you can expect the device to still function at 80 percent efficiency after 500 days of use.. This won't become apparent for some time, of course, but what's immediately obvious is just how gorgeous the Honor 8 Pro is. Whereas the Honor 8 was clad almost entirely in glass, the Pro is mostly metal (barring the Gorilla Glass 3 covering the display) The navy blue model I've been playing around with catches the light in all kinds of visually appealing ways -- this will be the only color available at launch, but black, gold and potentially more hues are in the pipeline. It looks and feels like a seriously premium device, and there are soft curves in all right places. With antenna bands running horizontally close to the top and bottom ends of the handset, there's no denying the Honor 8 Pro gives off strong iPhone vibes .. The only downside to this beautiful body is that it's a bit on the big side, though it's still nice and thin at 6.97mm deep. This does mean, however, there's enough space for a 4,000mAh battery with fast-charging support that'll apparently keep the thing going for two days of regular use. More importantly, though, there's room for a vibrant, stunning 5.7-inch Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440) display. To showcase this striking screen, the Honor 8 Pro comes with the Jaunt VR app preinstalled, and the device's box actually converts into a cardboard VR viewer. It's not particularly comfortable, but it's a nice touch to include this accessory as standard, and in a clever way.. I kinda feel like Huawei's shot itself in the foot with the Honor 8 Pro. All things considered, I don't know why you'd buy the new Huawei P10 flagship over the Honor 8 Pro, especially as the former has a few inferior specs and is significantly more expensive at £549. The P10 does have the Honor 8 Pro beat in the camera department , though, at least on paper. Still, you're getting an excellent dual 12-megapixel camera setup (f/2.2 on both) on the new Honor device that takes some delightful shots, as well as an 8MP shooter up front for selfies. In wide aperture mode, you can play around with focal point and background blur, which is always fun, and as one of the two sensors is monochrome, you can snap native black-and-white pictures. Low-light performance is also very impressive as far as my brief experience with Honor 8 Pro has shown.. Gallery: Honor 8 Pro camera samples | 15 Photos. The Honor 8 Pro is available to pre-order in the UK today from Huawei's vmall store for the introductory price, including various accessories, of £474. The official launch is set for April 20th, at which point it'll also hit Amazon. There's no word on US pricing or availability yet, but I'm fairly sure we'll hear more about that in due course as Honor continues to push its brand in the region. And what better phone to do that with than the gorgeous Honor 8 Pro?. emui , gear , gopro , hands-on , honor , honor8 , honor8pro , huawei , mobile , smartphone.

The build and design of the phone is fantastic and everyday work happens very smoothly on the device. There isn’t a game or app that didn’t perform on the phone. If there is a downside, it’s the viewing angles and overall brightness of the display. The camera performs well in well-lit situations, but falls short in light photography..

Huawei Honor 8 Pro is currently available at the best price of: ₹25,978. The story for every great hero starts with a villain. The more intriguing, dangerous and exciting the villain, the more thrilling is the journey of the hero and his success. In the story of flagship smartphones, OnePlus emerged as the brand that gives birth to flagship killers. With the OnePlus 5 however, the price of the flagship killer has risen. At Rs 32,999, the 6GB OnePlus 5 is a great deal,. but the success of OnePlus has put another company in an attractive position – that of being a OnePlus killer. We are talking about the Honor 8 Pro. On paper, it brings with it almost every spec. and function to take on the OnePlus 5. Will the emergence of a new hero retire the old one?. Looks, design and build quality: A sexy design and no bulging camera. The Honor 8 Pro review unit we received is Navy Blue in colour and it makes the smartphone very attractive and appealing. Kept idle on a table, the device will definitely turn heads. Just like flagships of today the smartphone has an all metal body.. On the front, the smartphone has a 5.7-inch display with a. There are no physical buttons below the display keeping the back, home and multitasking buttons on-screen. Above the display, we have the earpiece and the front-facing camera. The bezels on the side of the display are quite thin and the Navy Blue colour just makes the phone pop. At the bottom of the device, you have the USB-C port, headphones jack, and the speaker grill. On the left, we have the Dual-SIM tray and the second SIM slot doubles up as a hybrid SIM slot. On the right, we have the volume rocker and the power button.. Coming to the rear of the Honor 8 Pro, the smartphone has a smooth metal back. It makes the phone slippery, but not as slippery as the Galaxy S8 which has a glass back. The fingerprint sensor rests at the back and is very conveniently located. The one place where the Honor 8 Pro gets more marks than the OnePlus 5 is how well they have fit the dual camera setup on. There is no bulge and the two cameras merge. The only question that comes to mind here is why are the words “Dual Camera” written next to the two cameras? In the past, this is where Huawei has put the Leica branding when their smartphones boast. So just stating the obvious next to the lenses seems a bit odd.. The OnePlus 5 is 0.4mm thicker than the Honor 8 Pro, but the Honor 8 pro is about 3mm taller. The OnePlus 5 weighs 153 grams and the Honor 8 Pro weighs 184 grams. Despite such minute differences in height and thickness of the smartphones, the Honor 8 Pro has a 5.7-inch QHD display and sports a 4000mAh battery, whereas the OnePlus 5 has a 5.5-inch 1080p display and a 3300mAh battery.. Currently, among all the flagship smartphones available out there, the Samsung Galaxy S8 takes the prize of being the best-looking smartphone out there. The Honor 8 Pro doesn’t beat it, but proves that an all metal design mixed with some sexy colours can make for a very attractive proposition. Compared with the OnePlus 5, it’s definitely the sexier of the two.. 5.7-inch 1440p IPS display: is resolution the only thing that matters?. Coming to the display of the Honor 8 Pro, like we mentioned, it has a 5.7-inch LTPS IPS LCD display with a 2560x1440p resolution. In our test, the display clocks a maximum of 458 lux brightness. To put things into perspective the OnePlus 5’s 1080p Optic AMOLED display has a maximum brightness of 750 lux. When it comes to real world performance however, the display of the Honor 8 Pro worked fine in indoor, outdoor, and dim-lit situations. The auto-brightness adapts well and the screen is very visible outdoors,. on a fine July afternoon in the Noida heat.. When it comes to the colour reproduction on the display of the Honor 8, by default the display has a cool tone to it,. which means that you will see hints of blue all over the place. The display settings of the smartphone offer three presets – default, warm and cool. A good thing is that you also have the ability to manually change the colour temperature of the display if you like. Setting the colour temperature to worm worked perfectly for us.. One of the biggest downsides of the display is that the viewing angles aren’t great. Watch the display dead center and everything looks great. Move around and you will realise that the viewing angles of the phone aren’t the best.. We watched a bunch of videos on the Honor 8 Pro, and apart from the viewing angles, the experience was good. In the Spiderman Homecoming trailer where city landscape looked lush and even Spidey’s red and blue suit looks vibrant. The the dark and gritty environments in the Death Stranding trailer also looked great. The audio output is loud enough for a bunch of people to huddle up and enjoy watching these trailers.. Overall, the content consumption on the display is a treat. Be it playing games or watching movies. The only downside is that the viewing angles aren’t great.. Straight out of the box, the Honor 8 Pro runs on Android 7.0 skinned with the EMUI 5.1. Those that have seen Honor's UI in action in the past will feel at home here. Since the smartphone has 6GB RAM, we didn’t encounter any EMUI related stutters in every day work, multitasking, gaming, so on and so forth.. The UI doesn’t have childish or cartoony icons anymore, and the number of preloaded themes on the device are enough to give it a more mature look. By default, there is no app drawer and all the apps are listed on the home screen, but if you are someone that likes the app drawer, you can get that by changing the home screen layout in the settings menu.. Overall, there is nothing to complain about the UI of the smartphone. There were no random crashes and the overall experience of interacting with the UI, multitasking and accessing the quick settings from the drop down was a breeze.. Performance: A beast on the inside?. Starting with everyday performance, there was no noticeable lag, hiccup, or problem with launching everyday apps and playing games. Be it multitasking, browsing and heavy gaming, the Honor 8 Pro can handle anything you throw at it. no serious heating issues with the smartphone either. Yes, when you play a heavy game like Asphalt 8 for a long period of time, the phone does get warm, but that’s normal as the metal back is dispensing heat. There was nothing alarming about the temperature the smartphone reached.. Moving to the fingerprint sensor at the back, it is blazing fast and accurate. It unlocks in a heartbeat and that is very good.. Below is a look at how the Honor 8 Pro performs compared to its competition when it comes to benchmarks.. Coming to the camera, just like so many other Huawei and Honor smartphones, the Honor 8 pro sports a dual camera setup. Unlike other Huawei products we’ve seen, this one doesn’t house the Leica. Both the RGB and monochrome sensors on the Honor 8 Pro are 12 megapixels. The logic behind two sensors remains the same as previous Huawei devices – more light for better pictures. With some software mumbo jumbo, the Honor 8 Pro combines data from both sensors for good looking images.. When it comes to the performance of the rear camera, in well-lit situations, the camera clicks good photos. The details are good and the colour reproduction is quite accurate. But, when it comes to low light, the loss of colour and details is obvious. The images clicked in low light are noisy too. The bokeh effect in well-lit situations comes out very well. images, and the fact that you can control the level of blur in post-production is nice. From a subtle effect to an absolute blur the effect is impressive. Overall, the camera performs well in good lighting conditions, but not the best when it comes to low light. To put things in perspective, the Honor 8 Pro has a better camera when it comes to well-lit situation and bokeh effect, when compared to the OnePlus 5, but the OnePlus 5 has a better camera for low light photography. Like we’ve mentioned earlier, the device has a 4000mAh battery tucked into that slim profile. Considering the device has a 2K display, you can expect some intensive apps like games and Netflix to guzzle the battery. I typically lost close to 15% battery with under 1 hour of Netflix viewing. You can expect considerable battery drain if you are a heavy gamer too. In both cases, the brightness was set to auto. However, if you are a basic user who. makes calls, some texting, YouTubing, a bit of social media and some light games and web browsing, you will be left with 10 to 20% battery at the end of the day, depending on usage. In our PC Mark battery test the device lasted for 517 minutes. To put things into perspective, the OnePlus 5 lasted for 750 minutes.. Overall the Honor 8 Pro is a good device for what it offers. The build and design of the phone are. fantastic and everyday work happens very smoothly on the device. There isn’t a game or app that didn’t perform on the phone. If there is a downside, it’s the viewing angles and overall brightness of the display. The camera offers good performs in well-lit situations, but isn't great for low-light photography.. So is this the OnePlus 5 killer we’ve been waiting for? Well, let’s broaden the horizon shall we. The Honor 8 Pro is priced at Rs. The OnePlus 5 starts at Rs. Other smartphones in this price bracket include the Oppo F3 Plus and Moto Z2 Play. If you are looking for some modular enhancements, then you can consider the Moto Z2 Play, it is an interesting product. If you are looking for raw power and a brighter display, then the OnePlus 5 is the way to go. But if a sleek and sexy device is what's on your mind, and stock Android is not a must, then you can consider the Honor 8 Pro. It has all the makings of a phone that is great value for the buyer’s money.. Honor 8 Pro (Navy Blue, 6GB RAM.... Honor 8 Pro (Midnight Black,.... Redmi Y1 (Gold, 64GB).

Inkian Jason : I have copied over the release section, although one of the references was missing <ref name=Carlon/> is undefined in that section's markup, and does not appear to be anywhere else on the article or talk page. Cheers, • • • Peter (Southwood) (talk) : 16:17, 21 July 2017 (UTC). The reception section is out of my comfort zone. I do not have the time or interest in phones to investigate where the Wikipedia borders of acceptability lie for quoting reviews, so you will have to wait for someone who does more work in this field. Cheers, • • • Peter (Southwood) (talk) : 16:24, 21 July 2017 (UTC). ( edit conflict ) @ Pbsouthwood : Thank you for your help thus far. I have to admit, I am not sure where the Carlon markup went wrong. My best guess is that I had planned to use an Android Authority source (I have this (now bad) URL in my notes ), which was written by Kris Carlon, to verify the available colors and head-mounted display. However, this link is no longer working properly, and other inline citations are used to verify these claims, so I think we can continue without this specific source, unless you have any other concerns. Inkian Jason ( talk ) 16:28, 21 July 2017 (UTC). • • • Peter (Southwood) (talk) : 18:05, 23 July 2017 (UTC). @ Pbsouthwood : Thank you for adding the "Release" section. I will see if I can find another editor to help with the "Reception" section. Thanks again! Inkian Jason ( talk ) 16:29, 21 July 2017 (UTC). An edit request by an editor with a conflict of interest has now been answered. @ Inkian Jason : I am uncomfortable with the tone of the selected excerpts from the reviews, in particular the TechAdvisor line seems to pick out very selective quotes, having read the review I don't think the quotes reflect the tone of the review as a whole. This is particularly evident when comparing it with other good phone articles e.g. The first two references aren't based on reviews but rather what seems like first impressions to the phone being announced. jcc ( tea and biscuits ) 18:06, 23 July 2017 (UTC). I am also concerned that the summary and chosen quotes from the reviews may not be balanced. I don't think I personally am interested in reading the reviews and trying to correct any issues I find in the proposed text for the section. An alternative is to thin the section text and let our readers read the reviews themselves and maybe an independent editor will eventually be interested in doing a better summary. ~ Kvng ( talk ) 14:58, 24 July 2017 (UTC). @ Jcc and Kvng : Thank you both for your initial feedback. I tried hard to draft a balanced, neutral summary of the reviews, but like I said, this can be very hard to do given reviewers' specific personal preferences and various comments both criticizing and praising the model. I tried to incorporate the most overarching commentary as best as possible, instead of focusing on very specific points raised. I'm not too proud to ask others for help in drafting the best possible section. User:Jcc , if you're willing, can you trim what you believe should not be included? And User:Kvng , I am comfortable with adding a thinned section and letting readers expand appropriately over time. Can one or both of you help here? I am open to helping with the trimming as well, but I'd prefer to let other editors take a first stab, if possible. Thanks again! Inkian Jason ( talk ) 17:28, 24 July 2017 (UTC) (ed. The issue is that everything you've quoted from the reviews puts the product in a positive light and you have a declared COI on this subject. It could be that it is a great phone and no one has found anything significant to criticize about it or it could be an editorial slant. You are not in a position to make that assessment and I've already said I'm not interested in reading all these reviews to determine what's going on here. ~ Kvng ( talk ) 18:57, 24 July 2017 (UTC). I agree that my proposal is too trimmed. With my proposal, we're putting the raw material out there and hoping that an interested, independent editor will finish it. ~ Kvng ( talk ) 19:00, 24 July 2017 (UTC). By lumping all the reviews together version 2 is if anything more promotional. I agree that if you are unable to come up with a less slanted version it may better to just list the publications that have reviewed it. The ratio of positives:negatives in the text should reflect that of the reviews but at present as far as I can see you've only listed one negative from all the reviews (The Register) and ignored the negatives that the other publications came up with. What you're fundamentally missing is an 'on the other hand, reviewers criticized the...' counterpart to the text. This structure is particularly evident in the iPhone 5 example text I linked to above, which is a listed good article. jcc ( tea and biscuits ) 20:38, 24 July 2017 (UTC). @ Jcc and Kvng : Thanks again, both, for your feedback. How do either of you feel about the following version?. That is brief, factual and balanced and I'm comfortable with it. ~ Kvng ( talk ) 21:23, 26 July 2017 (UTC). @ Kvng : Great! Thanks for taking another look. If you or User:Jcc are willing to copy over the markup, I'd be much appreciated. I also wonder, should the stub tag be removed from the bottom of the article, now that a couple sections have been added? Inkian Jason ( talk ) 16:07, 27 July 2017 (UTC). @ Kvng : Thank you!

Over the past few months, I've been working with Honor to improve the Huawei Honor and Huawei Honor 8 articles (see Talk:Huawei Honor and Talk:Huawei Honor 8 ). On behalf of Honor, I'd like to propose some improvements to this article, which was created on April 6 and includes an infobox and three short sentences as a lead. Currently, sourcing for this article is simply one primary (Huawei) URL.. I am proposing a couple minor changes to the infobox and a section dedicated to the phone's specifications. This section is very similar to the "Specifications" section of the Huawei Honor 8 article, and I've worked to ensure accuracy and neutrality. 157 × 77,5 × 6,97 mm.

I am looking for an uninvolved editor to review this proposed text and copy over to the article appropriately. I can respond to questions here or on my talk page. Inkian Jason ( talk ) 16:54, 8 June 2017 (UTC). This edit request has been answered, and I have marked this section as resolved. Inkian Jason ( talk ) 21:50, 20 June 2017 (UTC). Hello, I am back with an additional request to expand and improve this article. As a reminder, I have been working with Honor to improve this article and others, via Burson Marsteller Hong Kong as part of my work at Beutler Ink.. First and foremost, someone added Huawei Honor 9 as the phone's "successor" in the article's infobox. Since the Honor 8 Pro does not have a successor yet, can this be removed?. Next, I propose two new sections: "Release" and "Reception". This way of organizing the article is in line with others for tech products, including Huawei Honor 8. For the "Release" section, I propose the following (markup included below, for easy copy and paste, if appropriate):. Preorders started to be accepted in early April in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. [1] [2] The phone formally launched on April 20, 2017. [3] In the United Kingdom, the phone was made available for pre-order from Huawei's vmall store. [4] [3] Honor planned to sell the phone throughout Europe, but not within Australia or the United States, as of May 2017. The Honor 8 Pro launched in India on July 6, 2017, [8] [9] [10] and was sold exclusively through Amazon India. [11] [12] [13] Huawei had previously hosted a soft launch event for the phone in Delhi. [14] The Honor 8 Pro was set to launch in Malaysia in July 2017. The Honor 8 Pro's packaging features a box that converts into a Google Cardboard head-mounted display for virtual reality. [16] [5] [17] The phone also comes with the virtual reality software Jaunt VR pre-installed. ^ "Huawei Honor 8 Pro boasts two cameras, two-day battery life (hands-on)".

For the "Reception" section, I propose the following:. Alex Dobie of Android Central called the Honor 8 Pro the "biggest, highest-specced Honor phone to date". [1] Android Police's Jordan Palmer said the phone "looks to be one of the best phones out of the Chinese giant's sub-brand yet". [2] Andy Boxall of Digital Trends complimented the Honor 8 Pro for its value, build quality, and user experience. [3] Rajiv Makhni of Hindustan Times said the Honor 8 Pro and OnePlus 5 , which were released around the same time, "are set to create turbulence in an already churning market and may teach customers that buying phones at prices like 60K is simply foolish". [4] In his review of the phone, PC Magazine 's Thomas Newton wrote, "The Honor 8 Pro takes many of the best bits of Huawei's recent high end phones [...] and comes up with a satisfying, and very reasonably priced result." [5] Andrew Orlowski of The Register wrote, "What Huawei is doing here is unusual: it's selling its current technology at this price but disguising under the Honor brand. There would have been some nice-to-haves: Qi charging, waterproofing, infra red .... but it's hard to find fault with a product as solid and well designed as this, and we did try." [6]. SlashGear's JC Torres called the Honor 8 Pro "one of if not the most formidable Android smartphones" of 2017, and wrote: "The Honor 8 Pro is definitely one of the unexpected surprises of the smartphone market this year. You would have never expected that Honor, whose smartphones so far have been on the far side of mid-range, would come so close to Huawei's own flagship while still remaining within reach for many consumers." [7] TechAdvisor 's Henry Burrell awarded the phone 3.5 out of 5 stars, and called it a "promising device" and Honor's "highest spec phone" to date. [8] Luke Johnson of TechRadar rated the Honor 8 Pro four out of five stars. [9] ZDNet 's Sandra Vogel concluded her review of the phone by saying, "What I can say is that it's well built and well specified, and also relatively affordable. As such, it's likely to give some of 2017's premium flagship handsets a good run for their money." [10]. ^ Dobie, Alex (April 5, 2017).

Phone model reviews can get very nit-picky, with writers pointing out very specific things they like or don't like about specific phones. For this section, I tried my best to summarize reviews using the 'takeaways' from each, giving due weight and ensuring accuracy and neutrality throughout. I don't think either of these proposed sections are particularly contentious, but I am happy to answer any questions or address concerns here. Is there a volunteer editor who can review these proposed additions, then copy over the markup appropriately? Inkian Jason ( talk ) 16:43, 21 July 2017 (UTC).

Simply giving readers a list of publications that have reviewed the phone does not seem helpful. Is there a way to only trim the parts that are problematic? I took a stab here:. Proposed text for "Reception" section (version 2). Several publications noted the model's most advanced specifications by Honor to date, including Android Central, Android Police, and TechAdvisor. [1] [2] [3] Reviewers also commented on the phone's value. Andy Boxall of Digital Trends complimented the Honor 8 Pro for its price, build quality, and user experience. [4] Rajiv Makhni of Hindustan Times said the Honor 8 Pro and OnePlus 5 , which were released around the same time, "are set to create turbulence in an already churning market and may teach customers that buying phones at prices like 60K is simply foolish".

I reduced the quotes and tried to stick to things like star ratings and comments on specifications, instead of personal preferences. Additionally, I grouped together similar comments by type: the first sentence is about the phone's specifications, while the rest of the paragraph is about the model's value. The Hindustan Times commentary describe's the phone impact on the industry, and mentions a competitor, so I don't think neutrality is a problem here. The Register comments on the model's value, but also includes a features wish-list, so I'm hoping this is also considered balanced enough.. The second paragraph is simply a short direct quote and star ratings. Is this looking better? I am open to further suggestions, but hopefully this is an improvement over the longer version proposed initially. Inkian Jason ( talk ) 18:42, 24 July 2017 (UTC). Overall, initial reviews of the Honor 8 Pro were positive, averaging 8.1 out of 10. [1] TechAdvisor 's Henry Burrell awarded the phone 3.5 out of 5 stars. [2] Luke Johnson of TechRadar rated the Honor 8 Pro four out of five stars. [3] Andy Boxall of DigitalTrends rated the phone 4 out of 5 stars. [4] Reviews of the phone noted its value, long battery life, metal body, and fast performance. [5] [2] [6] Rajiv Makhni of Hindustan Times , Andrew Orlowski of The Register and ZDNet 's Sandra Vogel wrote that the phone pricing is lower than for flagship phones with similar hardware and features. [7] [8] [9] Reviews did however note that the phone did not have contract options in the UK at the time of launch, [2] [10] and that other phones offered better design. ^ "Huawei Honor 8 Pro".

I'm really trying here, so any help is appreciated. Inkian Jason ( talk ) 17:37, 26 July 2017 (UTC). Done ~ Kvng ( talk ) 16:18, 27 July 2017 (UTC). On behalf of Honor, I have uploaded an image to Wikimedia Commons and request its addition to this article's infobox: File:Huawei Honor 8 Pro.jpg (which is currently in the OTRS permissions queue). I prefer not to edit the article directly, given my conflict of interest, but I'm hoping another editor can add the image on my behalf. @ Kvng and Pbsouthwood : I am pinging you two in case either of you are willing to help with this very simple request.

Honor 8 Pro Review, Specifications and Price In India. Huawei sub-brand Honor has launched its forth generation dual camera smartphone - the Honor 8 Pro in India. Interestingly, it is the same phone that launched in China last October as V9. The phone possesses powerful hardware with intriguing software and much talked about dual rear camera setup. The first thing that one will notice about the phone is its slim waistline even when it packs a massive 4000mAh battery. Unlike its predecessor’s smudge-prone glass design, the 8 Pro flaunts an all metal back which feels solid. 1440 x 2560 2K resolution which is quite sharp for an LTPS panel that targets DCI-P3 gamut (515 PPI ). Under the hood, it ropes an updated version of Kirin 960 chipset that is mated to Mali G71 GPU. Honor 8 Pro performance and multitasking are smooth and delightful thanks to 6GB RAM on board. For Gamers, Huawei has added the support for Vulkan API for 3D gaming. Huawei in India offering 128GB inbuilt storage along with support for 128GB microSD card which can be swapped with secondary SIM, if in case you need it. Another key highlight of the phone is the Dual Rear Camera setup. Like it predecessor, it pairs an RGB sensor with Monochrome together and later stitches both images together with the help of software. That’s not all, It seems that Honor has taken the consumer feedback seriously and has added the support for 4K recording in the upgraded version of the Honor 8. For selfie buffs, It packs 8-megapixel selfie camera up front. The Honor 8 Pro supports all world 4G+ bands and VoLTE networks. The phone dual band WIFI, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, USB Type-C port and 3.5mm jack with a number of other sensors including infrared. The Honor 8 Pro Best Price India is Rs. 29,999 and you can buy it exclusively on Amazon India. If you are Amazon Prime customer, you can buy Honor 8 Pro during Prime Sale (July 10) and avail 15 percent discount using HDFC credit card.. Stunning display Good Optics Elegant Design Massive battery with fast charging support VR box packing. No FM Radio Not Water resistance. The Honor 8 Pro is indeed an interesting mix of new and old hardware, without the latter compromising the entire package. Huawei's first Dual Camera for one - it's already been upgraded but the original is still more than relevant. The front camera of the Honor 8 is an 8MP unit shooting images at 3,264 x 2,448 pixels. It's paired with a f/2.0 lens. There is the obligatory beautification feature, which attempts to mask skin blemishes, but mostly gets rid of any fine detail in the shot. Non-removable battery No FM radio The older USB 2.0 standard on a Type-C connector No water proofing. The Honor 8 Pro has massive 4,000mAh battery which kind of ensures superlative longevity. Again, this a hulk like tendency as it can take a lot and yet not feel the heat. The phone also supports fast charging technologies, ensuring that phone gets juiced up and ready to go in 2 hours. Huawei uses its own top of the line eight core processor. It has twin 12-megapixel cameras on the back one a standard RGB camera while the other being a black and white camera and on the front there's a 8-megapixel shooter.. Good Optics Elegant Design Fast charging. The Honor 8 Pro takes off where the Honor 8 left, adding a larger display, a faster chipset, more memory, and a bigger battery, all in a very slim and elegant metal body. That being said, it doesn't differ all that much as a concept – it still offers a dual camera with depth of field tricks, very good battery life, and the same pretty, functional interface, all at a price that undercuts the direct competitors just enough for potential users to pay attention.. Top battery life among modern phones with Quad HD displays Very fast charging time given the battery capacity Functional interface with rich gesture support Copious amount of RAM and smart memory management Vulkan graphics support. Initial camera focus is slow, and 4K video is jittery Photo and video colors could use a bit more pizzazz Unwieldy for one-handed usage and pocket-dwelling Display colors are way off on the cold side. The Huawei Honor 8 Pro's great specs and affordable price make it a worthy option if you want high-end features without emptying your bank account.. Neat dual-lens camera A great screen Plenty of power. Battery life is disappointing No waterproof. it wont last for a day eventhough playing moderate games like candy crush and few hrs of 4g browsing. One of the Best Smartphones Around.. It Matches & Even Surpass Many Flagships. A True Flagship Killer phone With Killer Specs. Best Smartphone (Rear) Camera in Daylight probably. Charging Speed is the Big Let down. A Vry Slow Charging compared to Oneplus.. Looks Premium, Well Built Flagship Top Notch Specs 2k Display. Availability Pricing VR Box 6GB Ram 128GB Rom One of the Fastest Processor's Best Performance overall. Slow Charging, 2Hours for Complete Charge. Super fast processor, very big RAM, big display, high resolution. This is very nice For Gamers and others. Honor 8 pro is the best phone for Huawei and Honor Series. Speed is faster than Samsung S7 edge and Equaled S8.. Big storage of 128 gb Super big RAM of 6gb Superfast processor Sharp display Best display size for Gaming and other works Big battery of 4000 mah battery Dual Camera.

Screentrooper Honor 8 Pro review 28th June, 2017. Premium build and design, great handling, slim profile and sleek looks.The fingerprint scanner has class-leading speed and accuracy. The LTPS IPS LCD screen has great punch, superb contrast, and brightness. Less than stellar color accuracy, but excellent sunlight legibility for an LCD unit.The Honor 8 Pro delivers solid battery life with an endurance rating of 77 hours.EMUI is a functional Android overlay, even if it has its quirks. The Kirin 960 chipset offers class-leading CPU and GPU performance. The GPU is a bit power-hungry and does run a bit hot, but there are no noticeable consequences to the actual gaming experience.. The multimedia package gets the job done - the gallery benefits from the new Discover tab with GoPro-made Highlights, the image editor is powerful. The music app looks good and works well, but fails to offer an equalizer. Good low-light images, and excellent long exposure photos.Good regular selfies, but the colors came out somewhat dull.4K videos are very detailed, if a little noisy, but the h.265 codec makes for problematic sharing. The 1080p footage is nothing special. The dynamic range on both is just average.. Fast charging Slender design A great screen Android 7.0 Nougat Powerful battery life for long hours usage. Non-removable battery No FM radio The older USB 2.0 standard on a Type-C connector No waterproofing. Honor 8 Pro Review 11th April, 2017. We have the most intriguing blue version to play with. The phone is very thin at sub-7mm, and light for its 5.7” display diagonal, at 184g. For comparison, this is a lighter and more compact device than the 5.5” iPhone 7 Plus, which also carries a dual camera on the back.Honor decided to equip the 8 Pro with a Quad HD LCD display with 2560x1440 pixels resolution, catapulting it straight into flagship category. Thankfully, it was also wise to place a big battery pack on the phone, as Quad HD handsets consistently score much worse in our battery life benchmark than their 1080p counterparts with the same battery capacity.. Thanks to that dual camera setup, Honor 8 Pro offers wide aperture mode for photo and videos, which creates a more pronounced blur in the background of your photos.Unlike the Honor 8, the 8 Pro can capture 4K video with 30fps, thanks to the fast new chipset.All in all, a very solid offer from Honor, and one that would cement its value-for-money reputation, as the 8 Pro can spar with the best of the top-shelf handsets, and come out unscathed.. Vulkan graphics support Top battery life among modern phones with Quad HD displays Powerful battery with Quick Charging 6 GB RAM for smooth processing smart memory management Functional interface with rich gesture support. Initial camera focus is slow, and 4K video is jittery Photo and video colors could use a bit more pizzazz Unwieldy for one-handed usage and pocket-dwelling Display colors are way off on the cold side.
