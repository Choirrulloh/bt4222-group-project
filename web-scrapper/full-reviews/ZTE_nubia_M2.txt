Phone always restarting every opening cpuz apps from playstore. Little glitch on transition although it has SD435 not smooth transition. But i found that camera is good and has minimun noice on pict. Bought it as new year's gift for myself and I'm impressed, highly recommend.. Well, display could be slightly better, FHD instead of HD, SoC could be the SD625 instead of the SD435. And maybe a slightly bigger battery or/and a fast charging. But anyway, let's say not bad for its respective price-to-performance segment..

ZTE Nubia M2 Play is currently available at the best price of: ₹8,999. Nubia M2 Play is the latest addition to the company’s portfolio, replacing the Nubia M2 Lite ( review ). The smartphone is powered by a Snapdragon 435 chipset and comes with 3GB of RAM. It iterates some of the same mistakes made by its predecessors, but has its moments as well.. Nubia’s candy bar design looks good and even though the device is targeted at budget buyers, it has a premium feel. The Nubia M2 Play sports a unibody metallic design and feels quite sturdy. It features rounded edges, which makes holding the device during longer gaming sessions comfortable.. However, the polished finish on the smartphone makes it a bit slippery and prone to drops if you are not diligent while using it. A large display, combined with the polished back also interferes with the overall ergonomics of the device, which aren’t great.. The fingerprint scanner is integrated with the home button on the front and works quite well. The capacitive back and settings keys appear as two red dots alongside the home button. The one on the left of the home button is meant to open settings within apps, which is an aberration from the usual recents key placement.. The rear camera rests on the top left of the device on the back, with an LED flash next to it. The camera has a red ring around it, which adds to the overall looks. The grey Nubia logo is placed below the camera system. The power button is on the right edge of the device, whereas the volume keys are placed on the left. The headphone jack sits on the top and the micro-usb charging port and speaker grilles are placed at the bottom. It is worth noting that only one (the one on the right) of two speaker grilles plays audio, whereas the other one is only for aesthetics.. The Nubia M2 Play sports a 5.5-inch TFT display with a 720p HD resolution. The display leans more towards warmer tones and one can observe a slight colour shift while viewing the smartphone from different angles. The display feels dim and luminance scores came to a low 293 lux on our test. We struggled with the display under direct sunlight, even with the brightness set to maximum.. The smartphone runs on Nubia UI 5.0 on top of Android 7.1.1 Nougat and its UI takes some getting used to. While you can get used to this, there are some stark changes from Android. One of them of course is the placement of a capacitive settings key instead of recents. Also, the quick settings are accessed via a swipe from the bottom, which most users won’t be used to at first.. The main issue with the software is the number of unnecessary permissions even basic apps ask. For example, the calculator app needs access to Phone and the Gallery app needs access to contacts and location. Most of these are unwanted, but Nubia has made them essential permissions, meaning you cannot use an app without granting access. This is a big concern, which the company needs to address.. The device also features a split screen option that allows two apps to run simultaneously, which works pretty well. It is activated by swiping up from the bottom center of the display. You can watch YouTube videos while surfing the web and so on. The UI has no app drawer, which is normal in smartphones today.. The Nubia M2 Play is powered by a 1.4Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 Octa-core chipset, which we’ve seen on many budget devices this year. We experienced long loading times and slight lags while playing Asphalt 8 and NFS No Limits.. The device gets a bit warm after 30 minutes of continuous gaming, but that’s not abnormal in Delhi’s current temperatures. The smartphone is backed by 3GB of RAM, which is a norm for smartphones in its category. Navigating the UI feels slow, with resource intensive apps taking more than a second to launch. You’ll probably not use Adobe Lightroom on this phone, but you’ll still feel the sloth often.. Overall, the Nubia M2 Play is not the best performer you will find in this price range. It’ll do the job for day-to-day tasks, but being an Android phone, it is bound to slow down. Since it starts off slow, this will perhaps happen faster on this device.. Nubia has always highlighted cameras on its devices and the M2 Play is no exception. It is equipped with a 13MP rear camera with a f/2.2 aperture lens. However, in low lighting conditions, it is sub-par at best. Photos captured in dim or low lighting have a lot of noise and lack sharpness. Photos taken in normal daylight lack sharpness too and show some visible noise. The camera is also slow to focus, which means you will often end up with blurry photos when shooting in a hurry.. We also observed colour noise, which is not expected from any smartphone camera today.. Hundred percent crop of the above image. Overall, you can get some usable shots in well lit conditions, but low light photos are often unusable and the camera as a whole isn’t the best.. The same can be said for the 5MP front facing camera, which takes decent photos under well lit environments. But as soon as it encounters low light conditions, images show undersaturated colors and much more visible noise. Nubia seems to have compromised heavily with the M2 Play’s camera to cut costs.. percent crop of the above image. The in-built camera app provides some additional features under the “Camera Family” tab. The options include slow motion, time lapse and many more video modes that are fun to try out.. percent crop of the above image. The 3000mAh battery on the Nubia M2 Play lasts for an entire day of normal usage. The smartphone lasted for about 8 hours and 48 minutes on our PCMark battery test. In real world testing, with some internet browsing, video playback and a bit of gaming, it easily lasts for an entire day.. It drops about 7% battery (on idle) overnight, which isn’t expected off phones with Android Nougat. Overall though, the battery on the phone performs is reasonable and will power your device for about 10 hours on a single charge.. The USP of the Nubia M2 Play is its camera, which to be honest, is not that great. Nubia has emphasised on the design, which is reflected in its stylish build. Apps asking for unnecessary permissions is a red flag, which the company needs to address. Overall, the Nubia M2 Play is a good looking smartphone, but it doesn’t bring the best value for money in the budget range.. Nubia M2 Play Camera Smartphone.... Moto C Plus (Pearl White, 16....

The display is nice to watch content on and battery life is impressive. Unfortunately, it runs an outdated version of Android and there is no news of updates at this point. Some users might find the UI confusing as well. Camera performance is good during the day but suffers in low light. Other devices such as the Moto G5s and the Xiaomi Mi A1 (Review) offer roughly the same hardware for less money, making the Nubia M2 feel overpriced.

ZTE Nubia M2 - a style and nothing excess?. The Chinese company ZTE knows a lot about creating memorable, beautiful smartphones. The manufacturer's flagship line is especially characterized by a great design. However, in addition to the external beauty, a modern phone must have the appropriate functionality. The hero of today's review, unfortunately, does not meet the demands of its price segment.. The main problem of the novelty is seen in weak technical characteristics. The eight-core Snapdragon 625 processor has a good balance of performance and power consumption, but is designed for the average price category. 4gb of RAM and the Adreno 506 GPU are worthy of coping with demanding games, however, there is no reserve of power in the bundle for the future. 64/128GB of ROM are reserved for the information storage. Thanks to the microSD -slot, this volume can be expanded by other 256GB.. It is also necessary to note the advantages of the gadget. Undoubtedly, they include an excellent thin full-metal housing, complemented by a pleasant corporate logo, a double camera and a curved glass of 5 and a half inches display. The SuperAMOLED -panel has both a brilliant energy efficiency and close to perfect brightness and contrast. A FullHD -resolution is enough for a clear, rich and detailed picture.. The aforementioned pair of 13-megapixel rear Sony photomodules demonstrates both an absence of noises and an excellent clarity of the image even with high dynamics of happening events. The front 16-megapixel module is also ready to surpass the analogs of most competitors. If you add a capacious 3630mAh battery with the quick charging, OTG and 4G support, a USB Type-C port, a fingerprint scanner and the modified Android 7.0 to the above parameters, the resulting "mix" will satisfy even the most demanding customers. But is it worth to overpay for the exterior and photographic capabilities? Everyone will have its own answer to this question.. Buy ZTE Nubia M2 on Aliexprss.
