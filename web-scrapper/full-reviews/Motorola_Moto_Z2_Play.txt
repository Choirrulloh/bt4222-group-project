CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The Moto Z2 Play has a beautiful screen and all-day battery life. There’s expandable storage, lots of software tricks and even a headphone jack.. The Bad Its best software feature doesn’t always work. The phone feels wide and uncomfortable without a magnetic back cover, and not much better with covers that don’t fit well. Last year’s Z Play had much longer battery life.. The Bottom Line Strong battery life, clever software and magnetic Mod add-ons make the Motorola Z2 Play a compelling midrange choice.. Amazing battery life, promising voice trick. The more time I spend with the Moto Z2 Play, the more I like this midrange phone.. It's certainly the most interesting handset in its price range. Those magnetic Moto Mods and a ton of software features and shortcuts take it way beyond what most $500 phones can do. The hardware gets the job done, and there are a lot of little touches I appreciate.. Go ahead and laugh, but the timer is the best of the four phones I've currently been using, including the Samsung Galaxy S8, HTC U11 and the iPhone. A timer may seem inconsequential, but since I've been using three times a day as part of an exercise routine, I really start to notice. (If you really want to know, the Moto interface lets you tap the time widget on the home screen to open the clock, plus you can save multiple timers, say for 1 minute and 2 minutes. The other phones have you open the clock app first and don't save timers, so I'm scrolling a lot to switch duration.). Anyway, I like this phone, and I'm eager to see how it compares to the upcoming OnePlus 5 , which will launch June 20. The 3T earned CNET's Editors' Choice award for its midrange prowess , so the OnePlus 5 should present some pretty stiff competition.. This review is based on near-final software. Motorola says a final version of the phone's software will be pushed out before the phone ships to consumers in July.). In the US, eager buyers can get it from Verizon in early July, or buy it unlocked from Motorola.com.. I have good news and bad news. The good news is that the best thing about the Z2 Play is its battery life. In our looping video drain tests, the Z2 Play ran an average of 17 hours, which is pretty great for a phone that costs a fistful less cash than tier-toppers like the Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ) and LG G6. Those guys ran for 16 hours and almost 13.5 hours, respectively, in the exact same test.. In real life, you should be able to easily go a day and a half or even two days with some heavy use. I streamed 45 minutes of YouTube video without making much of a dent. (Motorola claims the battery will last up to 30 hours total.). Are you ready for the bad news? It's that last year's Z Play ran for 23 hours in our video playback test, so this year's attempt isn't as much a marathoner. If you're looking for a new phone though, this is still very good.. Moto Z2 Play struts its Mod stuff. So that was the Z2 Play's best feature. Its most clever feature -- and its most promising -- is actually a voice command that opens apps when you simply say "show me." That's right: no wake word like "Siri," "Alexa" or "OK, Google" to call out before telling the phone what you want it to do. Just "Show me YouTube," "Show me Maps" -- you get the idea.. You just slide the shade that pops up and you're in. Or, in the case of the calendar and weather, the information floats on screen before fading off. Best yet, you can configure "show me" to work from the lock screen when it recognizes your voice.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News.

Compatible with all major US carriers. Difficult to use with one hand. The Z2 Play is a unique unlocked phone that combines solid performance with a modular design that taps into Motorola's Moto Mods add-ons.. New aspect ratios, curved displays, and iris scanners—manufacturers have spent the past six months doing just about everything to make their phones stand out from the crowd. The $499 unlocked Moto Z2 Play, on the other hand, builds on a concept Motorola established last year. It has a unique design that works with Motos Mods, useful modular back panels that bring new functionality. It also has snappy performance, great battery life, and is compatible with all major US carriers. And unlike the Z Droid , you even get a headphone jack. That makes the Z2 Play a great phone if you're sold on the modular build. Otherwise, the ZTE Axon 7 gets you a bit more power for less money.. Available in black, blue, gold, and gray (pictured here), the Moto Z2 Play is largely the same phone as the Moto Z Droid and Play Droid in terms of design. The svelte device is ringed by a band of metal along the sides, with a set of clicky volume buttons and a ridged power button on the right. The back panel is made of matte metal and features a protruding camera bump and a row of magnetic attachment pins for Moto Mods (more on those later).. Measuring 6.1 by 3.0 by 0.2 inches (HWD) and 5.1 ounces, the Z2 Play is identical to the slim Z Droid in dimensions, but manages to include a headphone jack on the bottom. That said, it's quite a bit bigger than the Samsung Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces) and the LG G6 (5.9 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.8 ounces), which feature new aspect ratios in order to accomodate taller, thinner displays. There's a sizable bezel above and below the display here, making the Z2 Play hard to reach across with your thumb and difficult to operate with just one hand, especially if you're using a thick Moto Mod.. View All 12 Photos in Gallery. There's a USB-C charging port on the bottom, with the aforementioned headphone jack next to it. The top has a combined SIM/microSD card slot that worked fine with a 256GB card. The phone is covered in a water-repellent coating to help resist splashes, but it's not IP rated in any way, so keep it dry when possible. If you want a waterproof handset, the Galaxy S8 is rated IP68 for water protection (and significantly more expensive).. The phone's 5.5-inch, 1,920-by-1,080 AMOLED display is easy on the eyes, with 401 pixels per inch. While it's not as sharp as the Quad HD S8 (580ppi), G6 ( 564ppi), or Axon 7 (538ppi), it's crisp enough that you won't notice any pixelation. Colors are deep and saturated and blacks are perfectly inky, only lighting up pixels as needed. Screen brightness is almost blinding at maximum and viewing angles are excellent, so you'll have no trouble using the phone outdoors. There's also a Night Display mode that automatically adjusts color temperature to warmer tones to help you sleep better at night.. Left to right: Moto Z2 Play, Moto Z. Using the preloaded Moto app, you can enable Moto Actions. These include gestures like twisting the phone to launch the camera app, chopping it twice to trigger the flashlight, and swiping down to shrink the screen for one-handed use. The most useful feature is Split Screen mode. Holding down the Recent Apps button allows you to divide the screen and run two apps side by side.. Moto Display works similar to the always-on display on the Galaxy S8 to show you notifications without pressing a button or unlocking your phone. Instead of being continuously on, however, the screen only lights up when you reach for the phone. Simply extending a hand toward the Z2 Play will bring up the time, date, battery percentage, music controls (if music is playing), and notifications. You can set it to fade in and out, so even if you trigger it accidentally it won't drain too much juice.. Moto Voice lets you control the phone with voice commands. You can have the phone speak calls and texts out loud and ask questions using the trigger words "show me." For instance, "show me the weather" will bring up the forecast, and "show me the calendar" will pull up your schedule and upcoming events. But ultimately, it doesn't provide much extra functionality beyond what Google Assistant already offers, and I prefer using the latter for its deeper Google integration and AI-assisted capabilities.. Like the Moto G5 Plus, the Z2 Play supports One Button Navigation. Enabling it lets you use the fingerprint sensor to perform various on-screen functions. Swiping to the left takes you back, swiping right brings up recent apps, touching the sensor once unlocks the phone, touching it again lets it function as a home button, and holding it down brings up Google Assistant. It's a simple and intuitive way to interact with your phone, spares your thumbs from reaching around so much, and frees up some screen space.. Along with it predecessors, the Z2 Play is among the few truly modular smartphones you can get. Unlike LG, which abandoned its Friends accessories, Motorola has not only stuck with Moto Mods but opened the door to third parties. The sky's the limit, which is part of what makes Moto Mods so fun and flexible. You can add anything from a wireless charging and backup battery, to a projector, to just a simple, stylish back cover. The best part is that they're perfectly streamlined: Snap on the magnetic back and your phone instantly recognizes what Mod you've attached, shows you how much battery it has, and turns the Mod on automatically.. Several new Mods launched with the Z2 Play. We tested the JBL SoundBoost 2 ($79.99), a compact-but-powerful speaker with a kickstand, a splash-proof coating, and 10-hour battery life. There's also the Moto TurboPower Pack ($79.99), a snap-on battery pack with a 3,490mAh cell that can add an extra day of battery life and fast charge your phone at 15W speeds. The Moto Style Shells ($39.99) offer attractive designs and add support for both Qi and PMA wireless charging standards at 10W speeds with minimal bulk, but you'll need to get a wireless charging pad separately.. Don't worry if you already have previously released Mods — the Z2 Play is fully compatible with them. The Moto Insta -Share Projector ($299.99) and Hasselblad True Zoom Camera ($299.99) both worked seamlessly with the phone.. The Z2 Play supports CDMA (850, 1900MHz), GSM (850, 900, 1800, 1900MHz), UMTS (850, 900, 1700, 1900, 2100MHz), and LTE bands (1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/20/25/26/28/29/30/38/41/66). It's the same set you'll find on the G5 Plus , allowing the phone to work on all major US carriers, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. We tested it on T-Mobile in midtown Manhattan, where we recorded solid network performance with top speeds of 14.3Mbps down and an unusually high 17.6Mbps up.. Other connectivity protocols include dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz), Bluetooth 4.2, and NFC, allowing you to use Android Pay.. Phone calls are decent, but nothing to write home about. Transmission clarity is fine, but voices have a rasping, robotic edge. Noise cancellation is good at blotting out background sounds, and we didn't have any trouble carrying on a conversation in a noisy environment. The earpiece is loud, which is good because it also serves as a speaker. That makes it great for phone calls, but subpar for music. Then again, you can always use the Soundboost 2 Mod.. The phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 626 processor clocked at 2.2GHz. It's a solid chipset, scoring 68,040 on the AnTuTu benchmark, slightly edging out the 625-powered G5 Plus (63,845). It can't match the powerful Snapdragon 820 processor in the Axon 7 (141,989) or the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 835 in the Galaxy S8 (158,266), but testing ran without a hitch.. See How We Test Cell Phones. The combination of a lightweight Android skin and 4GB of RAM under the hood is more than enough to handle all of your multitasking needs. We were able to play demanding games like GTA: San Andreas and Injustice 2 without a single stutter.. The phone clocked 8 hours, 18 minutes in our battery rundown test, in which we stream full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. That's nearly an hour longer than the G5 Plus (7 hours, 35 minutes), and significantly better than the S8 (5 hours, 45 minutes). With average use, it's more than enough juice to get you through the day. If you want even more power, the aforementioned TurboPower Pack Mod will give you a nice boost. The included Turbo Power adapter supports fast charging.. The Z2 Play has a 12-megapixel rear camera that takes crisp pictures in well-lit settings. It can't quite match higher-end phones, but we were impressed by the accurate color reproduction and the fast-focusing laser autofocus. Shots of detailed objects like plants and buildings showed little to no noise, and clarity was good. That said, the Z2 Play does lean heavily on post-processing, and shots taken on a cloudy day looked overprocessed and a little artificial.. The phone handled reasonably well in low lighting. Some pictures taken indoors were noisy and autofocus didn't lock on as fast, but that's inevitable with most phones. We were still able to get some solid low-light shots by using manual controls to adjust exposure and shutter speed. You can also tweak white balance, ISO, and focus to improve picture quality. The Z2 Play can also record 4K video at 30fps. Recordings are crisp and fairly stable. Generally, we found the phone to be a better shooter than the G5 Plus, but unable to compete with the S8.. The 5-megapixel front camera is also solid. Pictures are sharp and detailed, and objects in the background come across clearly. Low-light shots can be a little grainy, but there's a dual-LED flash on the front and support for HDR so we were usually able to take clear photos.. The Z2 Play comes running Android 7.1.1 Nougat, the same up-to-date build you'll find on the Google Pixel XL and essentially stock, aside from some special Motorola flavoring (the aforementioned Moto Actions, Moto Display, and Moto Voice). Motorola has a respectable track record with updates, so there's a good chance you may see Android O on the Z2 Plus in the near future.. The phone is free from bloatware aside from two preinstalled apps from Motorola. One is the Moto app that allows you to configure gestures and voice controls. The Moto Mods app doesn't do much aside from take you to the Motorola website. All the functionality that recognizes when a new Mod has been attached and gives you configuration options is built right into the Settings menu, so this app seems superfluous.. Out of the 64GB of internal storage, the phone has 48.68GB free for use. That's a good amount of space, but if you need more for apps, games, or 4K video, you can always use a microSD card and format it as internal storage.. The $499 Moto Z2 Play is yet another solid modular phone from Motorola. On its own, it offers respectable performance, long battery life, and compatibility with all major US carriers. It pulls ahead of some of the competition when you start snapping on Moto Mods. It's a unique level of flexibility you don't get with G6, the S8, or any other non-Motorola phone, for that matter.. That said, the Z2 Play doesn't have the fastest processor or the highest-resolution screen you'll find in this price range. The ZTE Axon 7 may be nearly a year old, but it gets you a higher-resolution display, a more powerful processor, and consistent software updates for $100 less than the Z2 Play. If you're willing to spend more, the Galaxy S8 is the best Android phone we've tested, with a sharper display and the fastest processor you can get. And if you're looking to save money and Moto Mods aren't of interest to you, the Moto G5 Plus remains a perfectly solid option.. Bottom Line: The Z2 Play is a unique unlocked phone that combines solid performance with a modular design that taps into Motorola's Moto Mods add-ons..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus (Laser, Phase detection). Software Features: Manual focus, Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control.

The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2200 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 14 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery Life, Moto Mods and Conclusion. by Stephen Schenck. Verizon - Verizon + Motorola - Motorola + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery Life, Moto Mods and Conclusion. Introduction Modular smartphone hardware is, at the very least, an intriguing concept: since phones are far from one-size-fits-all, it makes sense to let users choose the hardware features that matter most to them, and by making this hardware modular, it saves shoppers the expense of picking up a whole new phone every time their desires shift. But for as nice as the idea is, actually making modular smartphones work is an uphill battle, and even giants like Google have looked long and hard at such projects before eventually declaring, “Nope!” But last year Lenovo -owned Motorola did the impossible, and launched not just a modular smartphone, but a whole family of both modular phones and the modules that attach to them: the Moto Mods. We were promised that this wouldn't be a one-shot phenomenon, and this year they're indeed back, as we get a new phone and some new Moto Mods add-ons. Will this new batch of hardware finally convince the nay-sayers that modular smartphones are here to stay? Or is there little here that's going to sway a critic who wasn't already won over by last year's lineup? Join us as we take a look at the new Moto Z2 Play , as well as a trio of new Moto Mods. In the box: Moto Z2 Play Motorola Turbo Charge adapter USB Type-C to standard-A cable SIM tool Safety card Quick-start guide Design Thinner than the original Moto Z Play, but with that same, unavoidable Moto Z look The blessing of support for Moto Mods can also be a bit of a curse: on the one hand, you're giving a phone support for a growing body of add-on hardware, letting users augment the handset with a heavy-duty camera, extra battery capacity, or maybe even a digital projector. But on the other hand, you're locking your phone into being a particular shape and size, with Moto Mods support inherently linked to the physical makeup of a phone. While that does give Motorola some wiggle room to experiment with handset thickness, other aspects of the phone's design, from that utterly flat back panel to the prominent, centered camera bump, are set in stone. As a result, the Moto Z2 Play looks and feels a lot like its predecessors, even as it strays a bit from the decisions that went into making the original Moto Z Play. Perhaps most notably there, Motorola's decided to give us a thinner phone this time around, with the Z2 Play's 5.99mm thickness (no Moto Mods attached) coming in below the first gen's 6.99mm. As a consequence, though, battery size also takes a hit – which we'll talk about just a bit later. Layout-wise, we've got a 5.5-inch screen dominating the phone's face, with a fingerprint scanner below and front-facing camera hardware up top – including a rare dual-LED front-facing flash. The hybrid SIM tray (with support for microSD expansion) lives up top, and along the right side we've got the power button, as well as discrete up-and-down volume controls. Underneath we find the phone's USB Type-C port, and also the analog headphone jack – a feature we got on the first Moto Z Play, but not the other Moto Z phones. On the back, there's a camera that sure looks a lot like those on earlier Moto Zs, but that's hiding some new hardware within, and down below is the critical Moto Mods interface. By itself, the Moto Z2 Play is both quite thin and notably lightweight, coming in at just 145g. But neither of those will last for long, as the phone is just begging to have some Moto Mods attached. Display Bold colors are great, but come with some big tradeoffs From the moment you first boot up the Moto Z2 Play, the phone looks ready to impress with a dazzling, high-contrast Motorola logo on-screen. It's a great way to grab your attention, and really emphasizes some of the best properties of the phone's 5.5-inch AMOLED display. The screen's 1080 x 1920 resolution looks decent at this size, but by default the phone's interface doesn't take great advantage of all those available pixels, with text and on-screen elements displayed quite a bit larger than they need to be – and making the screen seem less well-equipped than it really is. Luckily, you can quickly make strides towards fixing that with a few settings tweaks. But while we were impressed by that early onslaught of classic-AMOLED saturation and bright colors, that honeymoon period didn't last. By default the phone is set to its “vibrant” color mode, but even in “standard,” which claims to deliver realistic colors, our tests found the screen doing not such a great a job at accurately depicting colors – and beyond the general intensity issues we see with AMOLEDs, we also found magenta hues in particular to be poorly reproduced, leaning much more towards blue than they should. Those disappointments continue when it comes to screen brightness, which seems to top out just north of 400 nits. That's significantly less bright than the majority of phones that cross our path, and notably worse than we saw on the much-more-affordable Moto G5 Plus – which hit nearly 600 nits. In the end, the screen is detailed and colorful, but still comes up short in a few key areas, and even for a $400 phone, we expect a little more.. 6.15 x 3 x 0.24 inches. 156.2 x 76.2 x 5.99 mm. 6.16 x 3.01 x 0.28 inches. 156.4 x 76.4 x 6.99 mm. 5.91 x 2.91 x 0.38 inches. 150.2 x 74 x 9.7 mm. 6.07 x 2.92 x 0.29 inches. 154.2 x 74.1 x 7.25 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Motorola Moto Z2 Play Compare.

Seriously Phone Arena you do moan about silly things. Camera is decent and if same as G5 Plus then it's sharp and detailed as I have Moto G5 Plus. And G5 Plus also has a loud and pretty bassy front speaker, probably same as this handset, did you not even adjust EQ settings?? One thing of note Moto should have made the phone thicker with bigger battery and that would remove camera bump and need for a Mod.

It is a slightly upgraded variant of the Snapdragon 625, hence the MSM8953-Pro official moniker. Bearing that in mind, we already have a few expectations to approach the performance section with.. With a total of eight Cortex-A53 cores, clocked at up to 2.2 GHz (200 MHz more than the SD625), the Snapdragon 626 is a solid mid-ranger. It aims to offer smooth performance - more than satisfactory for everyday tasks and thus enough for an average user. Built using a 14nm fabrication process, the SD626 is part of a growing number of highly power-efficient chipsets, which aim to prioritize battery endurance.. The only other upgrade brought about by the new chipset version seems to be Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity.. Aside from that, we were pretty sure what sort of performance to expect from the chipset in synthetic number-crunching tasks. Still, we were curious to see how the small bump in the clock speed would affect the numbers.. We should also note that the Z2 Play can be picked up with either 3GB and 4GB of RAM, with 32GB or 64GB of storage, respectively. We are testing the higher end one. It reports 3.6GB of actual usable memory.. AnTuTu 6 paints a pretty anticipated picture, with everything falling in line nicely. The Snapdragon 626 now shows an even smaler performance gap with the Snapdragon 650, which runs inside the original Xiaomi Mi Max. Then again, the boost probably comes courtesy of software improvements in Android as a whole.. With the possible exception of a few other Xiaomi models, it is hard to get better raw performance for your money than the Z2 Play has to offer. Then again, some of its contenders are really not that far behind and can still offer the same fluent real-life experience, and often for a a lot less money.. Basemark OS 2.0 - another popular compound benchmark, paints pretty much the same picture. Looking at the Lenovo P2 and Moto G5s Plus, we can't help but notice some tough competition within Lenovo's own ranks.. On to graphics then and the Adreno 506. Just like the tests show, the one inside the Snapdragon 626 is unchanged from the 625 variant. Numbers fall in line perfectly, especially in off-screen tests, where you get a level playing field.. In practical terms, the Adreno 506 is perfectly adequate for casual gaming on the Moto Z2 Play. Still, it falls behind the Mali-T880 MP4, inside the Helio X20 just slightly. If gaming is a real priority for you, it might be worth considering the MediaTek instead.. Then again, if you are in it for the fps, spending the same money or slightly more elsewhere could yield even better results.. While on the subject of good value, this seems like as good a time as any to bring up the Moto G5s Plus and the Lenovo P2 again. The first you can potentially pick up for about EUR 300, while the latter is EUR 50 cheaper.. Of course, they match the Moto Z2 Play only in terms of performance. In all other aspects, the three phones are vastly different - each with its own selling points.. Retail package, 360-degree spin, design 3. Display, connectivity and battery life 4.

The Z2 Play is a unique unlocked phone that combines solid performance with a modular design that taps into Motorola's Moto Mods add-ons. The Z2 Play is a unique unlocked phone that combines solid performance with a modular design that taps into Motorola's Moto Mods add-ons.. Twist It, Bop It, Split It, Swipe It. New aspect ratios, curved displays, and iris scanners—manufacturers have spent the past six months doing just about everything to make their phones stand out from the crowd. The $499 unlocked Moto Z2 Play, on the other hand, builds on a concept Motorola established last year. It has a unique design that works with Motos Mods, useful modular back panels that bring new functionality. It also has snappy performance, great battery life, and is compatible with all major US carriers. And unlike the Z Droid , you even get a headphone jack. That makes the Z2 Play a great phone if you're sold on the modular build. Otherwise, the ZTE Axon 7 gets you a bit more power for less money.. Available in black, blue, gold, and gray (pictured here), the Moto Z2 Play is largely the same phone as the Moto Z Droid and Play Droid in terms of design. The svelte device is ringed by a band of metal along the sides, with a set of clicky volume buttons and a ridged power button on the right. The back panel is made of matte metal and features a protruding camera bump and a row of magnetic attachment pins for Moto Mods (more on those later).. Measuring 6.1 by 3.0 by 0.2 inches (HWD) and 5.1 ounces, the Z2 Play is identical to the slim Z Droid in dimensions, but manages to include a headphone jack on the bottom. That said, it's quite a bit bigger than the Samsung Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces) and the LG G6 (5.9 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.8 ounces), which feature new aspect ratios in order to accomodate taller, thinner displays. There's a sizable bezel above and below the display here, making the Z2 Play hard to reach across with your thumb and difficult to operate with just one hand, especially if you're using a thick Moto Mod.. View All 12 Photos in Gallery. There's a USB-C charging port on the bottom, with the aforementioned headphone jack next to it. The top has a combined SIM/microSD card slot that worked fine with a 256GB card. The phone is covered in a water-repellent coating to help resist splashes, but it's not IP rated in any way, so keep it dry when possible. If you want a waterproof handset, the Galaxy S8 is rated IP68 for water protection (and significantly more expensive).. The phone's 5.5-inch, 1,920-by-1,080 AMOLED display is easy on the eyes, with 401 pixels per inch. While it's not as sharp as the Quad HD S8 (580ppi), G6 (564ppi), or Axon 7 (538ppi), it's crisp enough that you won't notice any pixelation. Colors are deep and saturated and blacks are perfectly inky, only lighting up pixels as needed. Screen brightness is almost blinding at maximum and viewing angles are excellent, so you'll have no trouble using the phone outdoors. There's also a Night Display mode that automatically adjusts color temperature to warmer tones to help you sleep better at night.. Left to right: Moto Z2 Play, Moto Z. Using the preloaded Moto app, you can enable Moto Actions. These include gestures like twisting the phone to launch the camera app, chopping it twice to trigger the flashlight, and swiping down to shrink the screen for one-handed use. The most useful feature is Split Screen mode. Holding down the Recent Apps button allows you to divide the screen and run two apps side by side.. Moto Display works similar to the always-on display on the Galaxy S8 to show you notifications without pressing a button or unlocking your phone. Instead of being continuously on, however, the screen only lights up when you reach for the phone. Simply extending a hand toward the Z2 Play will bring up the time, date, battery percentage, music controls (if music is playing), and notifications. You can set it to fade in and out, so even if you trigger it accidentally it won't drain too much juice.. Moto Voice lets you control the phone with voice commands. You can have the phone speak calls and texts out loud and ask questions using the trigger words "show me." For instance, "show me the weather" will bring up the forecast, and "show me the calendar" will pull up your schedule and upcoming events. But ultimately, it doesn't provide much extra functionality beyond what Google Assistant already offers, and I prefer using the latter for its deeper Google integration and AI-assisted capabilities.. Like the Moto G5 Plus, the Z2 Play supports One Button Navigation. Enabling it lets you use the fingerprint sensor to perform various on-screen functions. Swiping to the left takes you back, swiping right brings up recent apps, touching the sensor once unlocks the phone, touching it again lets it function as a home button, and holding it down brings up Google Assistant. It's a simple and intuitive way to interact with your phone, spares your thumbs from reaching around so much, and frees up some screen space.. Along with it predecessors, the Z2 Play is among the few truly modular smartphones you can get. Unlike LG, which abandoned its Friends accessories, Motorola has not only stuck with Moto Mods but opened the door to third parties. The sky's the limit, which is part of what makes Moto Mods so fun and flexible. You can add anything from a wireless charging and backup battery, to a projector, to just a simple, stylish back cover. The best part is that they're perfectly streamlined: Snap on the magnetic back and your phone instantly recognizes what Mod you've attached, shows you how much battery it has, and turns the Mod on automatically.. Several new Mods launched with the Z2 Play. We tested the JBL SoundBoost 2 ($79.99), a compact-but-powerful speaker with a kickstand, a splash-proof coating, and 10-hour battery life. There's also the Moto TurboPower Pack ($79.99), a snap-on battery pack with a 3,490mAh cell that can add an extra day of battery life and fast charge your phone at 15W speeds. The Moto Style Shells ($39.99) offer attractive designs and add support for both Qi and PMA wireless charging standards at 10W speeds with minimal bulk, but you'll need to get a wireless charging pad separately.. Don't worry if you already have previously released Mods—the Z2 Play is fully compatible with them. The Moto Insta -Share Projector ($299.99) and Hasselblad True Zoom Camera ($299.99) both worked seamlessly with the phone.. The Z2 Play supports CDMA (850, 1900MHz), GSM (850, 900, 1800, 1900MHz), UMTS (850, 900, 1700, 1900, 2100MHz), and LTE bands (1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/20/25/26/28/29/30/38/41/66). It's the same set you'll find on the G5 Plus , allowing the phone to work on all major US carriers, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. We tested it on T-Mobile in midtown Manhattan, where we recorded solid network performance with top speeds of 14.3Mbps down and an unusually high 17.6Mbps up.. Other connectivity protocols include dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz), Bluetooth 4.2, and NFC, allowing you to use Android Pay.. Phone calls are decent, but nothing to write home about. Transmission clarity is fine, but voices have a rasping, robotic edge. Noise cancellation is good at blotting out background sounds, and we didn't have any trouble carrying on a conversation in a noisy environment. The earpiece is loud, which is good because it also serves as a speaker. That makes it great for phone calls, but subpar for music. Then again, you can always use the Soundboost 2 Mod.. The phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 626 processor clocked at 2.2GHz. It's a solid chipset, scoring 68,040 on the AnTuTu benchmark, slightly edging out the 625-powered G5 Plus (63,845). It can't match the powerful Snapdragon 820 processor in the Axon 7 (141,989) or the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 835 in the Galaxy S8 (158,266), but testing ran without a hitch.. See How We Test Cell Phones. The combination of a lightweight Android skin and 4GB of RAM under the hood is more than enough to handle all of your multitasking needs. We were able to play demanding games like GTA: San Andreas and Injustice 2 without a single stutter.. The phone clocked 8 hours, 18 minutes in our battery rundown test, in which we stream full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. That's nearly an hour longer than the G5 Plus (7 hours, 35 minutes), and significantly better than the S8 (5 hours, 45 minutes). With average use, it's more than enough juice to get you through the day. If you want even more power, the aforementioned TurboPower Pack Mod will give you a nice boost. The included Turbo Power adapter supports fast charging.. The Z2 Play has a 12-megapixel rear camera that takes crisp pictures in well-lit settings. It can't quite match higher-end phones, but we were impressed by the accurate color reproduction and the fast-focusing laser autofocus. Shots of detailed objects like plants and buildings showed little to no noise, and clarity was good. That said, the Z2 Play does lean heavily on post-processing, and shots taken on a cloudy day looked overprocessed and a little artificial.. The phone handled reasonably well in low lighting. Some pictures taken indoors were noisy and autofocus didn't lock on as fast, but that's inevitable with most phones. We were still able to get some solid low-light shots by using manual controls to adjust exposure and shutter speed. You can also tweak white balance, ISO, and focus to improve picture quality. The Z2 Play can also record 4K video at 30fps. Recordings are crisp and fairly stable. Generally, we found the phone to be a better shooter than the G5 Plus, but unable to compete with the S8.. The 5-megapixel front camera is also solid. Pictures are sharp and detailed, and objects in the background come across clearly. Low-light shots can be a little grainy, but there's a dual-LED flash on the front and support for HDR so we were usually able to take clear photos.. The Z2 Play comes running Android 7.1.1 Nougat, the same up-to-date build you'll find on the Google Pixel XL and essentially stock, aside from some special Motorola flavoring (the aforementioned Moto Actions, Moto Display, and Moto Voice). Motorola has a respectable track record with updates, so there's a good chance you may see Android O on the Z2 Plus in the near future.. The phone is free from bloatware aside from two preinstalled apps from Motorola. One is the Moto app that allows you to configure gestures and voice controls. The Moto Mods app doesn't do much aside from take you to the Motorola website. All the functionality that recognizes when a new Mod has been attached and gives you configuration options is built right into the Settings menu, so this app seems superfluous.. Out of the 64GB of internal storage, the phone has 48.68GB free for use. That's a good amount of space, but if you need more for apps, games, or 4K video, you can always use a microSD card and format it as internal storage.. The $499 Moto Z2 Play is yet another solid modular phone from Motorola. On its own, it offers respectable performance, long battery life, and compatibility with all major US carriers. It pulls ahead of some of the competition when you start snapping on Moto Mods. It's a unique level of flexibility you don't get with G6, the S8, or any other non-Motorola phone, for that matter.. That said, the Z2 Play doesn't have the fastest processor or the highest-resolution screen you'll find in this price range. The ZTE Axon 7 may be nearly a year old, but it gets you a higher-resolution display, a more powerful processor, and consistent software updates for $100 less than the Z2 Play. If you're willing to spend more, the Galaxy S8 is the best Android phone we've tested, with a sharper display and the fastest processor you can get. And if you're looking to save money and Moto Mods aren't of interest to you, the Moto G5 Plus remains a perfectly solid option.. Ajay Kumar is PCMag's Analyst obsessed with all things mobile.

Slim, sturdy, premium design Smart Android modifications Excellent battery life Moto Mods support. No EIS when recording 4K video Viewing angle issues Camera bump. Our in-depth Moto Z2 Play review uncovers whether or not Motorola’s first ‘Z’ phone of the year makes a worthwhile successor to the Z Play that launched only a few months ago.. The Moto Z Play is still on offer directly from Motorola for £369.98 with the Z2 Play already available for pre-order ahead of its mid-August release at £379 on the dot. For that, you get a tweaked, arguably hardier design and a fancier front-facing camera flash but a smaller battery and a lower resolution primary camera as well. As is so often the case in the smartphone world, however, less does not automatically mean worse and the Z2 Play looks like it’s bringing the heat in the mid-range space.. That said, it’s got some fierce competition from within its price range including the £379 Honor 9 , which considers itself a flagship and packs a punch to match, alongside the older, but still robust, Sony Xperia X Compact and the stunning Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) .. So can the Moto Z2 Play win us over with its masterful mid-range wiles or does it fall short of the mark despite a modular design and some solid performance?. Read next: Moto Z2 Force vs Moto Z2 Play: What’s the difference?. Being a member of the Moto Z family means one very important thing: all Z devices support Motorola’s Moto Mods ecosystem – a range of modular accessories and add-ons that augment each phone’s underlying hardware to enhance the user experience or throw on some extra functionality.. It’s a pretty smart and slick system and one of the only viable modular platforms that’s actually lasted in the smartphone space, with the LG G5 ’s ‘Friends’ range dying out before it really got off the ground and the same fate befalling Google’s modular smartphone concept, Project Ara .. As such, the Z2 Play is the first of the company’s 2017 smartphones to support Moto Mods and a few new offerings are launching alongside it as well. If any one aspect of your phone doesn’t make the grade then this is one of the few devices where that’s repairable to some extent. Don’t like the sound quality? The new JBL SoundBoost 2 mod will sort you out. Want wireless charging or need longer battery life? Motorola just released two new own-brand mods to meet those needs. There’s a forthcoming gamepad mod that’s compatible with hundreds of games from the Play Store as well.. Read next: What are Moto Mods?. As for the phone itself, it looks and feels as well developed and premium as any flagship. It’s incredibly strong and sturdy thanks to an all-metal body with rounded edges for comfort and a flat metal back with a dock at the bottom in order to interface with the various Moto Mods.. Aside from its clean appearance, the device also boasts a narrow 6mm profile, provided you excuse the 2mm deep camera bump up top.. Despite slimming down versus its predecessor, the Z2 Play also retains a standard 3.5mm headphone jack and a reversible USB-C port along the bottom edge, whilst the small hardware controls are textured and deliberate for better ergonomics, whilst a more comfortable pill-shaped fingerprint sensor nestles in under the display amidst the cover glass.. One constraint of the Z family is that they all sport 5.5-inch displays and as such have bodies to match, so they Z2 Play is a pretty sizeable phone in-hand, even if the software alleviates any issues to do with size and operation thanks to a native one-handed mode.. Unlike true flagship phones the Z2 Play doesn’t offer any formal level of certified water resistance, which is to say it has no IP (ingress protection) rating tied to it, as you’d find on the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S7 or S8, however, Motorola does coat the phone and its internal components in hydrophobic protective coatings so chances are the Z2 Play will still be fine should you decide to use it in the rain.. Moto Mods add a wealth of interesting and powerful functionality to this premium mid-ranger and the phone looks and feels like a flagship.. It’s a big device for one-handed use and that flat back means the phone will never look quite as slick as some rival smartphone designs.. Samsung typically leads the way when it comes to Super AMOLED panels but the Z2 Play’s 5.5-inch display is unquestionably easy on the eye, if a little imperfect.. The Full HD screen is expansive and sharp with great contrast, only marginally oversaturated colours (which is fine if you like a little punch) and strong overall brightness, meaning use in bright environments is seldom problematic.. There is a ‘but’, however, with colour distortion rearing its unwelcome head if you twist the phone away from face-on. It’s not too extreme but unquestionably visible, and a trait that, if memory serves, wasn’t present on the similarly specced panel employed by its predecessor.. Whilst it hasn’t echoed Samsung’s always-on screen tech, Motorola has given the Z2 Play a version of its familiar Moto Display feature, which we first encountered on the original Moto X. In this iteration just touching the phone or waving your hand near the display will cause it illuminate briefly, presenting you with a clock, battery readout and any pending notifications in a clear glanceable format. It’s a handy feature that works perfectly 99 percent of the time.. If you’re a movie lover it’s also worth mentioning the Insta -Share Projector mod. (£249.98), which as the name implies, snaps onto the back of a compatible handset like the Z2 Play and lets you enjoy media at up to 70-inches on any flat surface in an instant.. As for the audio experience, instead of a single downward-facing speaker like most mobiles, the Z2 Play’s main output comes straight from the earpiece. It’s nice to have a forward-firing speaker that’s less likely to be obscured when holding the phone in landscape and if the respectable audio it pushes out isn’t enough, that SoundBoost 2 Moto Mod is on-hand to add more volume, better bass, stereo separation and longer play time into the mix.. If you’re the sort who likes to carry their media around with them then the Z2 Play is also well-stocked on that front too. It comes with 32GB, or in the case of the UK model at least, 64GB of internal space and microSD expandability up to a whopping 2TB. Chances are you’ll never have to worry about filling this phone up completely.. The Z2 Play gives you a bright, punchy screen and decent audio but Moto Mods are again on-hand if you want to take things to the next level on both fronts. It also packs plenty of storage space and room to add more.. The display suffers from mild colour distortion at more extreme angles. It’s by no means a deal-breaker but a trait of the Z2 Play’s display to be aware of if you’re a media-lover who likes their visuals as true-to-source as possible.. Moto Display and one-handed use are actually part of a larger feature set unique to Motorola’s handsets dubbed Moto Actions. In the Z2 Play you can pull off a number of other feats including quick-launching the camera with a double twist of the wrist or access a wealth of voice actions activated by the words “show me” that operate independently of the “OK, Google” skill set.. For the most part, Motorola doesn’t warp the stock Android software setup all that much and the 7.1.1 Nougat experience on the Z2 Play feels clean and current as a result. The launcher is reminiscent of the one employed by Google’s own Pixel and Pixel XL , with a swipe up to reveal the apps drawer and a swipe right to get at Google Now. Nougat also means native split-screen multitasking, which is an enjoyable enough experience on the Z2 Play’s large display.. Aside from Moto Actions, Motorola also includes a Moto Mods app to support the growing number of compatible accessories, whilst some benefit from additional third-party apps, which could get messy depending on how many mods you plan on picking up.. We’re fans of the Z2 Play’s thoughtfully modified yet clean take on Android Nougat and the wealth of extra functionality made possible via the Moto Actions feature set.. Some of the Moto Actions are notably more useful than others but there’s very little to take issue with when it comes to software and user experience.. With such a short break between the Z Play and its successor, the internal hardware doesn’t appear to have changed all that much between the generations. That said, Motorola has updated the spec sheet enough to ensure that this new Moto feels suitably speedy alongside the competition.. The Snapdragon 626 and 4GB of RAM (3GB in some markets) puts plenty of pep in the Z2 Play’s step when handling everyday tasks like web browsing, photo editing and multitasking, with a beefy enough GPU to keep more demanding 3D games running at an enjoyable clip for the most part.. As for longevity, Motorola actually had to pack a smaller cell inside the slimmer-framed Z2 Play but despite the trade-off, you can still expect excellent battery life from this phone. It can take a day of heavy use in its stride or cover almost two days of lighter use. What’s more, the Moto Mods family is yet again able to augment the phone’s naturally aspirated battery with an additional power pack that shares in the phone’s native Turbo Power fast charge functionality or there’s a new wireless charging enabled Style Shell if you want to snip those wires altogether.. Outstanding battery life, even before turning to Moto Mods for a helping hand.. Dependable mid-range performance begins to crack under heavier loads like intensive gaming.. Along with a smaller battery, Motorola has also cleaved a few megapixels from the Z2 Play’s main snapper (versus last year’s model) meaning it now sports a 12-megapixel sensor (instead of 16). That said, it benefits from dual autofocus pixels, a pleasingly-wide f/ 1.7 aperture and enlarged 1.4µm pixels, paired with a wealth of other helpful additions like phase detection autofocus (PDAF), a laser autofocus array and a dual-tone LED flash, as on previous Moto Z handsets.. On the front you’ll find a 5-megapixel wide-angle camera with a narrower f/ 2.2 aperture that also benefits from a dual-tone LED flash too.. As for picture quality, we were seriously impressed with the Z2 Play’s efforts in most situations. Across the board, it struggles with fine detail but overall image presentation is wholly respectable. You get pleasing colours, well-balanced contrast, fast automated adjustment of everything from focus to exposure and it shoots in HDR by default. Low light shots are slow to take and little noisy but still well-captured after a bit of post-processing magic, and it’s all wrapped up in a simple, easy-to-use interface.. Video quality isn’t too shabby either. Fine detail and fast motion are the biggest issues and although image fidelity (including colours and contrast) are more appealing when shooting in 4K , you lose out on the capable electronic image stabilisation (EIS) system present when shooting in Full HD.. Motorola’s camera interface offers all the fundamentals you’d expect like manual control, panorama capture and slow motion video recording but some of the more creative tools, like real-time filters are absent.. A clean, simple interface powers a competent all-round set of snappers with pleasing colour, contrast and low light performance. If you want to step things up, the Hasselblad True Zoom mod brings lossless optical zoom and RAW image capture to the table.. Fine detail across the board looks a little muddy, low light photos take a long time to capture and EIS is absent from otherwise pleasing looking 4K video footage.. Read next: Moto Z2 Play Camera Review. Despite its name, the Motorola Moto Z2 Play is anything but fooling around, offering a flagship-like experience for almost half the price. It’s bigger and bulkier than similarly-priced mid-rangers and cracks under pressure when compared to the performance of a true flagship; but a premium design, great screen, excellent battery life and the unique benefits of the Moto Mods platform make this sub-£400 mid-ranger a seriously enticing smartphone..

Motorola Moto Z2 Play review: Lenovo’s modular phone makes a triumphant comeback. facebook twitter google+ email Comments. The Motorola Moto Z2 Play might be a mouthful but this modular smartphone builds on everything we loved about the original. Motorola Moto Z2 Play review: What you need to know Motorola Moto Z2 Play review: Price and competition Motorola Moto Z2 Play review: Design Motorola Moto Z2 Play review: Moto Mods Motorola Moto Z2 Play review: Performance and battery life Motorola Moto Z2 Play review: Display Motorola Moto Z2 Play review: Camera Motorola Moto Z2 Play review: Verdict. It’s no surprise last year’s Moto Z Play remains a top-tier smartphone. It cooked up almost everything to perfection, coupling top-notch looks with a long-lasting battery, a great camera and the ability to add capabilities via Mods. was kept to a minimum and its successor, the Motorola Moto Z2 Play, seeks to bolster the original’s successes.. And right off the bat, it’s great to see those Moto Mods are returning. Some said these extras were gimmicky, but I was convinced of their potential. Too often there’s a drawback when picking up your new phone, be it disappointing battery life or a missing feature, but these mods allow you to flesh out your phone as you see fit.. Motorola’s Moto Z2 Play is king where battery life is concerned. Like its mid-range forebear, it’ll cost you half the price of its flagship alternatives, and last a considerable amount longer on a single charge, too. There’s a 5.5in Full HD display and it has a Snapdragon 626 processor inside, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, expandable via microSD.. It’s also complemented with these ‘Moto Mods’, that. is a set of modular attachments that stick to the back of the phone. There’s a wide range of extras on offer, including a Hasselblad optical zoom lens, battery pack for added longevity and even a JBL-branded speaker.. Best smartphone 2018: The BEST UK phones you can buy from Google, Apple, Samsung and OnePlus. Best Bluetooth speakers 2018: Portable, indoor waterproof and budget Bluetooth speakers. As with its predecessor, another key part of the Moto Z2 Play appeal is its wallet-pleasing price. The Z2 Play will set you back a cool £379, in line with mid-priced handsets such as the OnePlus 5 at £449. There’s also the Honor 9 at £370 and the original Moto Z Play is still kicking about at around £365.. Those Moto Mods I mentioned? Pricing is varied, starting at £60 for the Incipio battery pack, running up to £250 for the projector add-on. The new mods – the JBL Soundboost 2, gamepad, wireless charger and 3,750mAh Motorola battery pack – aren’t available yet, though, and pricing is still to be confirmed.. Buy Motorola Moto Z2 Play now. When it comes to looks, the Moto Z2 Play doesn’t deviate too far from the rest of the Moto Z lineup, but there are a few subtle (and welcome) changes. The new phone’s aluminium unibody is just 6mm thin, a good 15% skinnier than last year’s, and it weighs a mere 145g, which is pretty impressive for a phone with a 5.5in display.. The glossy back has gone – thank heavens – and has been replaced with a fingerprint-friendly gunmetal grey matte finish instead. On the left edge, you’ll spot the volume rocker and power button, with a USB Type-C port for charging and 3.5mm headphone jack mounted on the bottom edge.. The rear camera protrusion is still there, bulging 2.7 millimetres from the rest of the device, and doesn’t play nicely with desks. The connector pins for the Moto Mods aren’t anywhere near as obtrusive, however, sitting flush with the rest of the phone’s rear panel.. Up its metaphorical sleeve lies the Moto Z2 Play’s party trick: it’s moddable. As previously mentioned, a series of connector pins reside on the back of the phone and these enable connectivity with a variety of add-ons.. And there’s a good handful of mods to choose from at the moment, which you can find on Motorola's website : the Hasselblad TrueZoom. adds a 10x optical zoom to the phone; the Incipio. gives you an extra 2,220mAh battery; the Moto. turns your phone into a mini projector; the. makes it faster to charge your phone without wires, and the. adds some grunt to your phone.. All of them are a doddle to connect and use. They snap magnetically with no mechanical latches to break or snap, and the stay solidly in place. Interestingly, Motorola has also released a Moto Mod dev kit, so expect to see many more third-party Mods become available in the near future.. However, not all mods are worth getting. I had a play with Motorola's smart speaker with Amazon Alexa and for £99 was bitterly disappointed. Even with the four added far-field microphones, Alexa didn't always pick up my voice and the fact that I could use Alexa without the mod, made me question the actual purpose of the add-on.. You'd also hope to hear a drastic improvement on the sound quality front, but I found a £30 Bluetooth speaker, such as the Creative Muvo 2c outshines the £99 moto mod. In comparison to the Muvo 2c, the smart speaker has recessed mids, a bloated bass and rolled off highs.. So, if you want a portable speaker solution and don't want to be lugging around a large-sized add-on, you'd be better off using the Amazon Alexa app on your Moto Z2 and a small Bluetooth speaker like the Muvo 2c..

With Qualcomm’s mid-sector octa-core Snapdragon 626 processor and 4GB of RAM, this was hardly going to be the snappiest of handsets, but we should see a jump from last year’s offering, which employed the older Snapdragon 625.. Buy Motorola Moto Z2 Play now. And, for the price, it’s a respectable enough performer. Here’s how it did in our Geekbench 4 benchmarks, which measure’s overall CPU performance:. The result, as you can see, is that the Moto Z2 Play performs better than its predecessor. In fact, the Moto Z2 Play has seen. bump when it comes to multi-core. and a 12% increase in single-core. It doesn’t fare quite so well against its similarly priced competitors, mind, lagging behind both the OnePlus 5 and Xiaomi’s Mi. and just a hair’s breadth above Samsung’s cheaper Galaxy A5 .. Graphics performance is less impressive, though, with no change in either the onscreen or offscreen GFXbench Manhattan 3.0 tests, at 10fps and 9.7fps respectively. Dodging incoming traffic in Crossy Road was easy enough but things did tend to slow down a little during enemy-heavy firefights in Sky Force: Reloaded .. Crucially, battery life is still impressive, although it doesn’t quite hit the heights of the Moto Z Play. because the Moto Z2 Play has a smaller 3,000mAh battery than the Z’s 3,510mAh, but longevity remains very good and it achieved a time of 19hrs 33mins in our video playback test. At the time of writing that was good enough to place it fourth in our all-time smartphone battery charts, behind the Lenovo P2 at the top, the Moto Z Play and the OnePlus 5.. On the surface, the Moto Z2 Play’s screen should be a beauty. Its 5.5in size is generous and the 1080p resolution sufficiently sharp that you can’t see the pixels in normal use. Unfortunately, it’s not quite as good as you might expect.. you two display modes to choose from: Vibrant and Standard. You’d expect the former to generate colours that are drastically oversaturated and they are that, but even in the slightly less in-your-face Standard mode, colours were way off.. Our colour-accuracy measurements returned an average Delta E of 4.04 (0 would be perfect), a result that indicates a display that struggles to reproduce key colours accurately.. Elsewhere, given this is a Super AMOLED panel, the contrast ratio is perfect and max brightness has jumped from 354cd/m2 to a more sunlight-friendly 420cd/m2, so it ought to be comfortably readable outside in all but the sunniest of conditions.. Just like last year, the Moto Z2 Play doesn’t have optical image stabilisation, but the rest of the specifications are decent. The resolution is 12 megapixels, falling from the 16 megapixels of last year, you get both laser and phase detection autofocus, and the aperture is a bright f/1.7.. The aperture, in particular, is a considerable improvement over the Moto Z’s f/2.0 and, in low-light, the difference is stark. As our still-life shot shows, the camera is capable of reproducing heaps of detail without too much noise spoiling the image. Exposure levels could do with a slight tweak, mind, as images did tend to look a little overexposed.. Outdoor shots didn’t pose too much of a problem, either. In fact, the Moto Z2 Play picks up plenty of rich colours and crisp details in sunny conditions, particularly in hard-to-capture areas like foliage.. Enabling HDR did have a slight tendency to make shots look artificial, with hints of oversaturation, but on the flipside it also tended to reduce instances of over-exposure.. With last year’s Moto Z Play bucking the trend of the middling mid-ranger, I had high hopes its 2017 successor would be even better. And, when all’s said and done, Motorola has created a fantastic smartphone in the Moto Z2 Play.. Its all-day battery life alone is enough to have you reaching for your wallet, even if it isn’t quite so long-lasting as last year’s. The issue, aside from the slight performance bump and the design overhaul, is that the Moto Z2 Play doesn’t really offer anything new. It’s still a thoroughly impressive phone, though, and one I’m happy to recommend.. Buy Motorola Moto Z2 Play now. Best phone battery life 2018: The BEST smartphones ranked.

Motorola is not even close to becoming one of the leading brands in the Android ecosystem, but the company's ambitions have certainly attracted attention to its latest devices, mostly because they relied on a partially new approach that others have so far avoided.. Living proof is the modular Moto Z, which launched with a concept that helped Motorola gain the desired media attention, but which failed to eventually become a full-time alternative to more popular models like Samsung's.. This year, however, Motorola gave another shot to the very same strategy with the Moto Z2, a device that’s based on the 2016 predecessor and which is built on the very same Moto Mods platform.. Basically, it's a modern version of the Z, and this time Motorola believes it has what it takes to gain some ground in the super-crowded Android battle.. At first glance, the Moto Z2 Play is just as appealing as the previous generation. Instead of glass, which I personally like in terms of design but hate as far as usability goes, Motorola has picked metal, which for me is quite a welcome change. Plus, it feels super-light in the hand, and it's because it really is. It tips the scales at only 145 grams, down from 165 grams on the Moto Z Play.. The 2017 model looks better, is thinner, and unsurprisingly, promises excellent battery life. The original Moto Z Play was highly praised for its battery life, so launching a new generation that's thinner, but which is also said to offer excellent autonomy certainly raises some doubts over these claims.. Motorola Moto Z2 Play technical specifications. 5.5 inches / AMOLED / 401 ppi Gorilla Glass 3. Qualcomm MSM8953-Pro Snapdragon 626 Octa-core 2.2 GHz Cortex-A53. 32GB (for 3GB RAM version) 64GB (for 4GB RAM version) microSD card support. 12 MP (f/1.7, 1.4 µm) 5 MP (f/2.2, 1.4 µm). First and foremost, the Moto Z2 Play features a 5.5-inch display (401 ppi , 1080p, AMOLED) and a design that is more or less outdated. While the entire world is now migrating towards bezel-less phones and edge-to-edge screens, Motorola decided to stick with the traditional approach and launch a model that has the same gigantic bezels at the bottom where the home button also resides.. I'd say this is kind of a risky approach, mostly because Motorola doesn't have the design legacy that other phones like the Sony Xperia XZ Premium have. Sony's model has become a love-it-or-hate kind of phone, and the boxy design with huge bezels makes sense just because there are buyers who like it this way. Motorola, on the other hand, doesn't have the same userbase to afford such experiments, so the company tried to impress in a different way.. While when viewed from the front the Z2 Play is more or less a dull phone, Motorola decided to spend more time on refining the experience with the home button. Because on this new generation, the home button serves many more purposes and for the first time supports gestures.. “ Home button / navigation controller. In other words, the home button with the integrated fingerprint scanner can replace the typical Android navigation controls, so you can quickly swipe left to go back in an app or in the OS, swipe right to launch the recent apps menu and just tap it to go to the home screen.. These are all tricks that take a while to get used to and so far, opinions are mixed on whether it's all a good implementation or not. While I do like gestures on my phone, replacing the navigation options that are placed to the left and right on the home button with quick swipes on the fingerprint sensors make the bottom bezel totally unnecessary , in the end becoming just a huge blank area that serves no purpose.. The back of the phone is where all the magic happens and features a connector for mods that reminds me of the Smart Connector on the iPad and which Apple was rumored at some point to bring to a so-called iPhone Pro as well. This connector makes it possible to quickly throw on a different module like a battery pack, a projector, a camera, or even speakers, and use it with little to no configuration.. Mods are great because they further expand the functionality of the phone, but in my couple of weeks with the handset, I found them pretty difficult to carry around, especially because some are fairly bulky. My review box included the following mods: Insta -Share Projector, Hasselblad 4116 True Zoom camera, Moto 360 Camera, and Moto TurboPower Pack.. One of the best things about this new generation is that it works with all the mods released so far, and honestly, Motorola couldn't afford not to make this possible. The company, however, hasn't improved the way the mods attach to the phone, and just like I said when I tried the 2016 model, these are mostly flimsy covers that don't stick well because they're magnetic and which are way too easy to be removed. But judging straight from the usability perspective, they're a nice touch that every geek would love.. The projector itself can be used to project pretty much anything from the phone screen to apps and YouTube videos. Image quality isn't the best, but on the other hand, it's good enough to be used during meetings, for instance. The audio of the phone is pretty loud for such a scenario too.. The Moto 360 Camera makes the phone look like a Google Street View car and although I found it particularly appealing at first, it was just the initial excitement.. First of all, it takes way too long to load the camera and sometimes, the camera app crashes and makes the phone unresponsive. To get the 360 camera mod to work, I had to restart the phone several times, but even then, taking photos wasn't possible because the app stopped responding at random times. Disconnecting the mod and launching the Camera app with the built-in camera worked flawlessly every time.. The one that I particularly liked was the Moto TurboPower Pack. This rather bulky-but-I-don't-mind mod adds another 3490 mAh to your phone and charges the device at fast speed rates rea ching 15W. By default, the Moto Z2 Play comes with a 3,000 mAh battery, so you get more than an extra full charge thanks to this mod. It recharges the battery from 10% to 100% in a little over 90 minutes.. Despite Motorola's claims, battery life isn't as good as on the previous model, though I'd say there's little chance not to be satisfied with it. The Z2 Play features 15 percent less battery capacity, but on average, you still get one full day easily. I'd estimate hardcore users would have to recharge it every 18 hours, and with the TurboPower Pack mod, battery becomes a thing that you no longer have to worry about.. And last but not least, it's the camera mod that promises to do magic for your photos. At least on paper, because in real life, not only that it makes the phone look like a hipster- ish Kodak photo camera, but it also brings only small improvements in terms of photo quality.. 3" sensor, this attachable camera's main strong point is the 10x optical zoom, which indeed does impress, but which you're rarely going to use. The mod comes with the typical classic camera controls, like a dedicated button to turn the camera on and off and a zoom switch, and it adds some 144 grams to the weight of the phone.. The camera app itself leaves a lot to be desired, and it's also buggy, taking more than a blink of an eye to actually take a shot. Obviously, when shooting a photo with the maximum zoom level it's nearly impossible to keep the camera steady, but with some training, you'll get it right eventually.. On the good side, it lets you shoot photos in JPEG and RAW formats, and the latter is particularly useful because it supports more advanced edits up to the point where you can save a totally ruined photo.. In terms of image quality, neither the standard camera or the mod impressed me. The Moto Z2 Play comes with a 12-megapixel f/1.7 and 1.4um sensor, and while the specs are OK, most of the shots lack the contrast and fine details of more expensive cameras. With some fine-tuning, you can improve the quality of the photo, but this obviously requires the skills and time to do it.. As compared to the previous model, the camera has been improved and it now features faster focus, though I can't notice the poor software processing and emphasize that optical stabilization is still missing. On the other hand, 4K video is supported should you want it.. The Moto Z2 Play gets its power from a Snapdragon 626 processor that's paired with either 3GB or 4GB RAM depending on the storage version you choose (32GB and 64GB, respectively). MicroSD card support, however, is also offered.. The CPU and the amount of storage are both living proof that Motorola wasn't shooting for the stars with this model and it's clearly positioned as a mid-range device. The $499 price tag might leave many expecting more, but there are several areas where the device clearly shows that it's not aiming for the premium, and the Gorilla Glass 3 and the chip choice are two of them.. While it loses points in the hardware section, Motorola tried to impress when it comes to software, so the Moto Z2 Play comes with nearly-stock Android 7 (soon upgradeable to 8) and a series of exclusive touches that you're going to like. For example, the OS has been customized with gestures, and a double twist action launches the camera. These are nice tweaks that many people are going to love, but for those like me who like a simpler and faster approach, they barely have an impact.. What I liked, on the other hand, was the voice command support because I found myself talking to the Moto Z2 Play more than I usually do with my everyday phone.. You can tell the Moto to launch apps using simple commands like "show me app," and for instance, you can simply say "show me the forecast" and the device automatically brings forward the weather conditions. Unfortunately, this feature doesn't work exactly as expected every time, and it happened more than once to fail to recognize the voice command.. Another interesting software touch is the so-called Moto Display, which shows your notifications when the phone is raised, pretty much like an iPhone with Raise to Wake enabled.. The Moto also supports waving the hand over it, and on this new model, it also shows the battery and includes quick notifications options like a reply box for messages. Again, while this feature is a nice addition, it lacks consistency, as I spotted the Moto Display turning on all by itself when sitting on the desk every few minutes without even being touched.. If there's something I truly like about the Moto Z2 Play it's the modular approach. While several phone makers have until now considered such devices, only a small group of them actually decided to give them a chance, and even fewer of them insisted with a second generation. Motorola does the right thing by not giving up on the modular concept just yet, and it has no reason to do it. The Moto Z2 Play comes with several substantial upgrades over its predecessor, such as the better camera and improved design, and there's hope the third generation would be even better. There are nice touches here and there that significantly improve the experience, like the fingerprint scanner gestures that replace the navigation controls. If it weren't for the big area at the bottom that becomes useless when gestures are enabled, this option could really be a neat touch to the device, otherwise, it remains just an experiment that not many are willing to stick with after trying it out. Battery life remains very good, despite Motorola reducing battery capacity by as much as 15 percent. And with the battery mod you get not only one full charge, but also fast charging should you need it.. While I do like the modular approach, I'm not the biggest fan of the way it was implemented. The mods attach to the back of the phone using a magnetic connector, and this method makes them feel super flimsy and sometimes you can accidentally remove them when holding the phone in hand. Motorola struggled to bring all kind of nice touches to the Moto Z2 Play, but they lack the refinements they needed to truly serve their purpose properly. One such example is the Moto Display. While I enjoy seeing the battery level and the latest notifications when the phone is raised from the desk, I noticed that the screen turns on every now and then without any movement or light change around it. This turned out to be pretty annoying when I'm working late and the phone is on the desk next to my laptop because the screen waking up every once in a while makes me switch the attention to the phone for no reason.. Motorola isn't trying to trick you into believing that the Moto Z2 Play can do more than it can. It's a mid-range phone whose main highlight is the modular approach. Features like the Snapdragon 626 processor, 32GB storage, and the Gorilla Glass 3 protection for the display are living proof that Motorola only wants this to be a mid-tier device, hoping that mods can still impress its buyers and convince them to stick around until the. To be completely honest, I think $499 is a price that's too big to pay for a phone like this, even with the modular concept. I do like having some extras to use with my phone, such as the camera and the battery pack, but carrying them around isn't the most convenient thing to do on a daily basis.. while they're based on a good idea, they might not be the perfect choice for everyone, and this eventually substantially reduces Motorola's targeted audience. In the end, however, trying out. the Moto Z2 Play and having all those accessories around makes you feel like a child playing with LEGO for the first time. And in the end, paying $499 for this limited-time special feeling is a decision that each and. # Motorola # Moto Z2 Play # Motorola review # smartphone review # Android review.

Samsung Galaxy S9 arrives today: 5 things to know. The State of 5G: When It's Coming, How Fast It Will Be & The Sci-Fi Future It Will Enable. Samsung unveils its camera-focused Galaxy S9 handsets. A second save slot in Metal Gear Survive costs $10. The original Moto Z Play was a popular device among those who wanted a massive battery in a mid-range device with decent hardware and software. The 3,510 mAh battery delivered some of the best results of the year, and when combined with Moto Mod functionality, the Z Play at its $400 price point was one of Motorola’s most successful devices.. The Moto Z2 Play is a little different. It's still a mid-range offering, slotting between the flagship Moto Z2 Force at the top, and the quality budget Moto G phones below. But instead of targeting battery enthusiasts like its predecessor, the Moto Z2 Play is a more traditional mid-range handset that offers access to modular functionality at a lower price point.. The battery has been reduced to 3,000 mAh, which is average for a mid-tier handset, as Motorola has opted for a slimmer handset over better battery life. The phone still uses a mid-range Snapdragon 62x series SoC, with a 5.5-inch 1080p AMOLED display. It’s still available unlocked and with stock Android on board.. The most curious aspect to the Moto Z2 Play is its price point. The phone is available for $408 locked to Verizon, or $499 as an unlocked device. This places it dangerously close to budget flagships like the Xiaomi Mi 6 and OnePlus 5 , which offer better hardware for a lower price.. Sure, the Moto Z2 Play is cheaper than most high-end phones like the LG G6, Galaxy S8, Moto Z2 Force, and so forth, but the market is more crowded than that, and the Z2 Play will have to offer something special to compete strongly. The most striking aspect to the Z2 Play is its slim body. At under 6.0mm thick, yet still packing a 3,000 mAh battery, the Z2 Play is one of the slimmest phones on the market right now. As before, this has come at the expense of battery capacity: the Z2 Play is a millimeter slimmer and 20 grams lighter than the Z Play, but its battery is 15 percent smaller. The Z Play wasn’t a fat phone by any stretch, so it’s interesting that Motorola felt the need to make the Z2 Play slimmer. Personally I’d prefer to keep the larger battery, but the Z2 Play’s slender construction is certainly pretty remarkable.. Opting for such a slim body has resulted in a very prominent circular camera bump on the rear, which protrudes several millimeters out to accommodate the 12-megapixel sensor and f/1.7 lens. From a design standpoint, the protruding bump doesn’t look bad, though when viewing the phone at off angles it can look somewhat strange. As an option, you can purchase “style shells” that clip onto the back and reduce the impact of the bump; one is included in the box.. The build quality of the Z2 Play is very good across the board. The phone is mostly made of metal around the sides and rear, with a polycarbonate antenna band wrapping around the entire rear slab in a way that looks fairly respectable. The design and copious use of metal makes the handset easy to grip and hold, which isn’t the case with competing phones with slippery glass backs. The front is protected by Gorilla Glass.. My main issue with the design is the massive amount of bezel around the display. This is quite clearly a 5.5-inch screen in a 5.7-inch body, with big bezels above and below the display, as well as a gap on either side. Modern smartphone design trends are about reducing bezel size, but Motorola hasn’t bothered here, which leaves their design looking dated. Naturally they do have some design restrictions to keep the Moto Z line compatible with Mods, but a larger screen would have been appreciated not just on the Z2 Play, but Motorola’s other Z phones as well.. Speaking of Moto Mods, the Z2 Play is compatible with the entire line-up released so far. Motorola is the only company with a successful modular phone lineup – other companies like LG tried and failed – and part of the success has come from having multiple phones that support the same mods. The Moto Mods ecosystem has grown slowly but steadily, and it’s reached a point where there are some genuinely useful additions.. My personal favorites are the battery packs from third parties such as Incipio and Mophie. The new 360-degree camera, along with the gamepad, are also clever additions that some may enjoy. All mods magnetically attach to the rear, and connect through the large pins on the bottom. Mods are easy to attach and detach when you want, and magnets are strong enough that mods won’t fall off during everyday use. The implementation is clever and it just works.. The rest of the phone is pretty well featured. There’s a fingerprint sensor on the front, below the display, though I feel it would be better if it doubled as a home button alongside capacitive navigation buttons; instead the Z2 Play opts for on-screen buttons. There’s also a USB-C port, a 3.5mm headphone jack (not found on the more expensive Z2 Force), and a water repellent nano-coating that protects against minor splashes. The Z2 Play doesn’t have an IP rating and it isn’t water resistant, but it should survive if you accidentally spill some water on it.. Like some other Motorola phones of late, the Z2 Play has a single speaker above the display, which is used for both phone calls and as a loudspeaker. The volume this speaker produces is average, and the quality is okay, though it'd have been nice to see an additional speaker on the bottom edge (or front) for a stereo experience..
