One of China's biggest phone makers launch a new phone, and it's loaded with an iOS-ish operating system and new camera tricks for better photography.. by November 2, 2017 7:22 PM PDT. The new Oppo R11s gets a bigger screen and new camera tricks. The Oppo R11s continues its iPhone copycat ways. Quick specs: Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 6-inch display (R11s), 6.43-inch (R11s Plus) Rear 20-megapixel and 16-megapixel camera, front 20-megapixel camera Memory and Storage: 4GB RAM (R11s), 6GB RAM (R11s Plus), 64GB onboard storage Battery: 3,200mAh (R11s), 4,000mAh (R11s Plus). It's been less than six months since the Oppo R11 made its debut, but the Chinese phone maker behind the iPhone lookalike is already releasing an updated model dubbed the R11s and a bigger R11s Plus.. But it's not just a simple refresh, as the new R11s and R11s Plus come with larger displays -- 6-inch and 6.43-inch respectively, both in an 18:9 ratio that's similar to the Pixel 2 and Xiaomi Mi Mix 2. Plus there are new camera tricks for even better photography.. With rear dual cameras of 20-megapixels and 16-megapixels, and a front 20-megapixel shooter powered by AI, the R11s promises to be a powerhouse photography device, something that Oppo has been emphasising with its recent phones.. Unlike other phones with dual cameras, Oppo says both of its F1.7 rear cameras are capable of taking pictures, not just utilising one camera (with the other being a monochrome or telephoto lens). Oppo says this makes pictures much better, as the phone will select the best camera for the job. For low-light shots under 50 lux lighting conditions, the phone will use the 20-megapixel sensor, for example.. It's an interesting technique to be sure, and we'll have to see how it holds up in real-world testing. Other photography-related features include an AI-powered selfie front camera, which Oppo says is trained to give you the best beauty shot. The AI will optimise the beauty settings to de-age subjects and remove skin blemishes to give you the perfect selfie every time. This happens locally, so you don't have to worry about your images being uploaded to Oppo to further train the AI.. The Oppo R11s features 20-megapixel and 16-megapixel rear cameras.. Sadly, the 5x zoom feature announced earlier this year at MWC isn't yet on the phone, so if you're hoping for better zoom compared to the current crop of devices, you'll have to wait. The phone still uses the old micro-USB, because Type-C cables aren't that common and Oppo wants you to charge your phone with ease. The good news, on the other hand, is it has an audio jack.. To be honest, though the R11s is a decent phone, it borrows way too much from Apple. The camera app, the faux-control center and the user interface is basically a copy of iOS. Even the new iPhone X isn't spared: The R11s comes with a feature to hide the navigation buttons with gesture controls similar to the X.. The control center looks awfully familiar.. I'm not a fan, but I'm not Oppo's target audience. That's younger folks looking for an almost iPhone experience without having to pay the premium. It's no surprise why the Chinese company is doing remarkably well in its home market as well as abroad.. The phone will hit China in November, followed by Taiwan and Singapore soon, with Australia to follow next year. The R11s will retail for 2,999 Chinese yuan, which converts to about $455, £345 and AU$590 respectively, while the larger R11s Plus will retail for 3,699 Chinese yuan, or $560, £425 and AU$730..

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Processor Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 (4 x 2.2 GHz, 4 x 1.9 GHz). Connectivity Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n/ac dual band. Dimensions and weight 155.1 x 75.5 x 7.1 mm. There are three big changes coming with OPPO’s new R11s compared to this summer’sÂ. The first is the 6-inch, 18:9 aspect ratio display. Thereâs very little bezel, though the edges arenât quite as curved as they are on the Samsung Galaxy S8. Overall, this new display looks great.. If you look closely, you can see what OPPO is calling the starry night effect, where there is a slight red gradient at the top and bottom of the glass. Itâs a subtle touch, but it makes the phone feel more like a single piece of hardware. This effect is only on the red model, which is the one we were able to spend some time with. You can also get the R11s in black or champagne, if youâre looking for a less flamboyant look.. Either way, you should know that the fingerprint reader has moved to the back of the phone, to accommodate the display. Fortunately, the reader seems just as quick as the one on the R11.. The second big change concerns the cameras. The dual 16 MP and 20 MP rear cameras are both “main cameras” offering 2x lossless zoom.Theyâre now both f/1.7 apertures, which should make the R11s a tad better than the R11 in low light. The 16 MP sensor handles everyday photos, while the 20 MP sensor is tuned for low-light conditions. “It will intelligently synthesize 2.0Âµm pixels to quadruple (4X) the size of the photosensitive area of the sensor, increasing the overall sensitivity to light for all images.”. While our time was very limited with the R11s, we were able to go out and get some camera samples. OPPO assured us that our unit was running final software, and image quality is just as good we expected. Images are very sharp and detailed, with accurate color reproduction.. One minor critique is a slight lack of saturation, or punchiness, which some will be used to getting on cameras like the Galaxy S8. Otherwise, this setup works pretty well in good lighting. You can check out some camera samples below.. Itâs difficult to judge low-light performance just yet, but itâs not looking much better than the R11. Thereâs a good amount of lens flare around bright objects, which you can see in some of our shots. Weâll take a closer look into this and report our findings in our full review in the coming weeks.. Perhaps whatâs most notable is the new AI beauty mode. OPPO tells us that they analyzed thousands of photos of people from around the world and consulted with beauty professionals to develop what is likely be the best beauty mode to date. Weâll take a closer look at that in our review, too.. The third change that OPPO presented was a new iteration of its ColorOS software, version 3.2. The R11s will run Android 7.1.1 out of the box. OPPO wouldnât comment on any potential Android 8.0 update and said it would instead focus on what its core audience in China wants, like the AI Beautification Mode. Thatâs also OPPO’s reasoning behind the choice of microUSB instead of USB-C.. One really nice design feature with the R11s is that the ports are indented, so the bottom is more comfortable to hold with your pinky finger.. As far as specs are concerned, the R11s has a Snapdragon 660, 64 GB of internal storage (plus microSD expansion), 4 GB of RAM, and a 3,200 mAh battery. The R11s Plus is similar, but features a larger display at 6.43 inches, bigger 4,000 mAh battery, as well as 6 GB of RAM.. While global availability and pricing is still to be determined, you can expect the OPPO R11s to cost around $475 and the R11s Plus to cost around $100 more. It might go without saying, but thatâs a very competitive price for what youâre getting, especially considering the number of improvements that OPPO has made from the R11..

It still sports a 6.01-inch display with a resolution of 2160 x 1080 pixels and an aspect ratio of 18:9.

Oppo R11s: The iClone you know and love, but not q.... Oppo R11s: The iClone you know and love, but not quite the one you deserve. 141 Users want this. 3.75 / 5. Face unlock is weaker than competition. Looks dated when compared to iPhone X. As an alternative to the iPhone 8, the R11s is easy to recommend - the performance is good, the camera rig is nice, it’s got a compelling build quality and slick feel-factor.. Though they often get lumped in with Huawei and ZTE, Oppo have always had a very particular approach to the smartphone market. They aren’t trying to be the best Android handset around. They’re playing a different game entirely, and their target audience isn’t the same one that HTC, LG and the rest are gunning for.. If anything, the Android brand that Oppo probably share the largest crossover with when it comes to target audience is probably Google themselves. Much like the the Pixel, Oppo’s phones are aimed at the all-too-common person who wants an iPhone but reels at the expensive asking price. Theirs is a plight that Oppo’s products try to evoke often than Donald Trump cites the struggles of mid-western American coal miners.. With Apple finally making significant strides forward with the iPhone X, 2018 is going to be a pretty interesting year for Oppo. However, before “interesting” things like the rumored R13 reveal themselves, the brand are kicking off the year with the R11s: a slightly-updated refresh on last year’s flagship R11.. The Oppo R11s boasts a 6-inch ultra-wide 18:9 AMOLED FHD+ display and comes powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor and 4GB of RAM. Under the hood, it pairs this up with 64GB of on-board storage (which can be further expanded via MicroSD. These technical specs are rounded out nicely by a 3200mAh battery, which charges via the Micro-USB port at the bottom of the device.. With regards to software, the R11s runs on Android 7.1 overlaid with Oppo’s friendly neighborhood ColorOS (V3.2) skin. Then, in terms of connectivity, the the R11S comes with Wi-Fi (802.11), 4G and Bluetooth (4.2). There’s no NFC, but the handset does support Dual SIM.. The R11s closes out the deal with a dual 20-and-16-megapixel rear camera with f/1.7 aperture and rear one boasting a 20-megapixel sensor and a f/2.0 aperture. This is actually a step down from the R11’s dual 20-megapixel rear-camera kit but otherwise pretty similar.. Next Page: Design, Performance, Camera, Battery Life and The Bottom Line.

OPPO R11s takes unique dual camera approach, also boasting stellar screen-to-body ratio. Adrian Diaconescu November 2, 2017 1:09 pm. Following in the footsteps of the surprisingly successful OPPO R9s and R11 , and most likely foreshadowing the arrival of the 2:1 OnePlus 5T , the China-first OPPO R11s has been fully and properly unveiled earlier today in Beijing.. Similar to the F5 selfie expert , the R11s comes with a 6-inch FHD+ “full-screen display.” The bezels are pretty narrow, but they’re obviously still there, with overall dimensions pretty much matching the 5.5-inch R11’s measurements.. At 155.1 x 75.5 x 7.1mm, the OPPO R11s boasts an 85.8 percent screen-to-body ratio that somehow manages to beat the Essential Phone ’s corresponding number (at least on paper) without resorting to divisive cutouts or notches.. A so-called “Crescent Arc” design integrates concave indentations into the edges of the handset, purportedly shrinking the traditional space occupied by the headphone jack, speaker and USB Type-C port.. We can’t wait to see how the curvy 6-incher actually feels in the hand, although right now, China is the only market with an official release date – November 10.. While it borrows some of the F5’s AI Beauty Recognition tricks to produce extra-sharp, natural selfies with a 20MP front-facing camera, the OPPO R11s doubles down on the rear shooter technology. And the dual cam operation is approached rather uniquely, with a 16MP lens in charge of “normal shots” in brightly lit environments, passing the baton to a 20MP sensor at night or in other dark conditions.. Ergo, there’s no secondary rear camera, and both these bad boys offer top-notch f/1.7 aperture. Still, the R11s is technically not a flagship device through and through, packing a mid-range Snapdragon 660 processor and starting at the rough equivalent of $450 (CNY 2,999) in “champagne” and black.. The snazzy red model costs 200 extra Yuan (3,199 in total, or $485), and there’s also a 6.4-inch OPPO R11s Plus on the way at CNY 3,699 ($560). The larger phone features 6GB RAM, compared to 4 on the “regular” R11s, as well as 4000mAh battery capacity vs. 64GB internal storage is offered across the board, along with ColorOS-skinned Android 7.1.1 Nougat software, fingerprint recognition, and yes, Facial Unlock technology promising to scan your mug in 0.08 seconds.

OPPO Intros ‘Full-Screen’ OPPO R11s And R11s Plus Handsets. November 2, 2017 - Written By Kristijan Lucic. OPPO had released the OPPO F5 in India earlier today, and following that announcement, the company has just announced the much-anticipated OPPO R11s and OPPO R11s Plus handsets. The OPPO R11s was listed on the company’s official website quite recently, which confirmed the design of this smartphone, and its partial specs, but the company waited until now to reveal all the info regarding the OPPO R11s and its larger sibling. Having said that, OPPO had introduced this phone, and it’s probably quite interesting to some of you because this is probably what the OnePlus 5T will look like, as it will probably be based on the design of the OPPO R11s.. The OPPO R11s and OPPO R11s Plus look identical, though the OPPO R11s Plus is the larger phone, and due to its size, some of their specs are different. The OPPO R11s and R11s Plus are made out of metal, and both of them ship with a rear-facing fingerprint scanner. Both phones sport a dual camera setup on the back, and as you can see, bezels are quite thin on these two devices. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 660 64-bit octa-core SoC fuels these phones, while Android 7.1.1 Nougat ships on both of them, along with OPPO’s custom UI, ColorOS 3.2. Both phones come with a dual SIM setup (hybrid setup), and you’ll find both 20 and 16-megapixel cameras on the back of these two phones ( the main camera has an f/1.7 aperture, 2.0um pixel size). A 20-megapixel shooter is included on the front side of both of these phones, and both devices AMOLED display..

The OPPO R11s comes with a 6.01-inch fullHD+ (2160 x 1080) AMOLED panel, while the phone ships with a 3,205mAh non-removable battery, which supports OPPO’s VOOC Flash Charge fast charging. The OPPO R11s also comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. The OPPO R11s Plus, on the other hand, features a 6.43-inch fullHD+ (2160 x 1080) AMOLED panel, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. This phone sports a 4,000mAh non-removable battery, which also supports VOOC Flash Charge. The OPPO R11s comes in Black, Champagne Gold and Red color variants, while it is priced at 2,999 Yuan ($454). The Special Edition Red variant of the device is priced at 3,199 Yuan ($484), though, and the OPPO R11s will go on sale on November 10. The OPPO R11s Plus will be available in Black and Champagne Gold color variants, and you’ll be able to grab it in China starting on November 24 for 3,699 Yuan ($560)..

Oppo's R11s continues the company's proud tradition of imitating flagship phones from Apple, LG and Samsung, and selling them for half the price. At just $659 outright the R11s feels like a great deal, and it is, but peek beneath the surface and you'll find how the company has managed to cut costs over its competitors.. It has a sleek, wafer thin design that embraces the current flagship trend of removing bezels to create a handset that is almost all screen on the front. It resembles LG's gorgeous V30, but the material — particularly the metal back cover — feels lighter and a little cheaper in the hand. And where those other flagships have beautifully rounded edges, there's a sharpness to the R11 where the glass meets the case. That sounds absurdly nitpicky, but in the hand this makes the phone uncomfortable to hold without a case.. The R11s takes unashamed inspiration from Apple and others.. The display is a 6-inch ultra-wide 18:9 OLED, an impressive inclusion at this price, but again it lacks the brightness and vibrancy the best screens available in a handset. It's by no means bad, it just doesn't pop like Samsung's S8 or the iPhone X.. Included inside is a generous 64GB of storage, and there's a microSD card reader to expand storage further. Oppo is marketing the camera as a flagship competitor, and the camera is fine for the price, but nothing compared to the quality of the industry leaders; the iPhone X, Samsung Note 8, Huawei Mate Pro and Google's Pixel 2.. Oppo has had the fastest fingerprint readers available — so fast I honestly thought they might be fudging it, but testing with some random thumbs in my office convinced me it was the real deal — but going all screen on the front means the fingerprint reader has moved to the back of the device. The placement is higher than I'd prefer but still reachable with smaller hands.. Along with a fingerprint reader, Oppo has included facial recognition unlock as well. When it works it is ridiculously fast, and in my testing it worked more often than both Samsung and Apple's implementation. But it appears to be less secure than the iPhone's array of sensors,. based simply on the front-facing camera. Still, a photo of my face was not enough to fool it.. Oppo's ColorOS continues to twist Android into the most blatant knock-off of iOS I've seen. Every built-in app, from Settings to Calendar to Music to the camera, are pixel-for-pixel copies of Apple's design for iOS 11.. How Oppo has avoided the wrath of Apple's lawyers is beyond me, but as someone who uses an iPhone far too much, this imitation has an uncanny valley feel to it. Everything looks almost, but not quite, right.. Much of Oppo's software design is somewhat familiar.. Even the "control centre" swipes up from the bottom, something I've never liked on iOS; I prefer Android's placement in the notifications drop down from the top of the screen. Of course Apple is moving the functionality to the top of the screen too, beginning with the iPhone X, but when your whole design philosophy is to copy you're always a year behind.. One benefit Oppo has consistently provided is including a screen protector, already applied, and a simple rubbery case in the box. This would cost the company just a few dollars, but it gives the phone protection from drops and scratches out of the box. It makes sense for lesser known brands to ship with their own cases — the phone case booth inside your local mall may have never heard of Oppo — but it's such a great customer friendly feature, that I wish all phone makers would copy Oppo here..

When Nets goes down for nearly a couple of hours in Singapore. November 27th, 2017 | by Wilson Wong. The Oppo R11s is the latest from the Chinese smartphone maker. The new Oppo R11s, launched in Singapore last week, is the followup to the Chinese phone maker’s R11 that promised good value for a power-packed device.. It’s clear on first glance that the company has made some changes. Gone is the fingerprint scanner in the front, which is replaced by a bigger 6.01-inch Full HD AMOLED screen in 18:9 ratio (2,160 x 1080 pixels).. To unlock the phone quickly, one option is face recognition. If you’re thinking of Apple’s iPhone X, yes, that’s what’s on my mind as well.. The Oppo R11s has a larger screen with small bezels. The phone has kept its thin profile and feels the same as the R11, which is a good thing. More importantly, it wants to solve. a little-known problem with smartphones – muffled sounds coming from the speakers as your right palm covers them while holding the phone in landscape orientation.. Oppo has carved out the bottom of the phone to create a small space to allow sound to escape. It shows that an innovative solution does not have to be complex.. One more piece of good news: If you don’t like to use speakers while watching Netflix, the 3.5mm stereo jack is still around for you to plug in your favourite earphones or headsets.. The bottom part of the R11s features a concave cut-out that allows sound to escape. The presence of the 3.5mm headphone jack is a welcome addition as well. Since the Oppo R11s is touted as a camera phone, you can expect improvements in image quality as well.. The phone’s dual cameras now sport two dissimilar sensors – 16 megapixels for the main camera and 20 megapixels for low-light scenes. Both come with an f1.7 aperture lens, so taking handheld night shots should not be an issue.. My concern is the size of the sensor pixel. If the sensor is to capture more light, the pixel should be as big as possible even though the R11s’ pixel size is already at 2.0µm.. Squeezing 20 megapixels into the sensor would mean the light capturing area for one pixel site is actually much smaller but Oppo says it overcomes this by merging the pixel sites to collect more data.. If that’s the case, the effective pixels could be much lesser than the 20 megapixels on the sensor and that might affect the image quality. Only a proper test would throw some light on how effective is the implementation, which I hope to do when I get a loan unit for review.. The other improved feature is the beauty mode capture that uses the front-facing 20-megapixel camera with an f2.0 lens. The phone is able to capture 254 facial recognition points in 3D and compare the data with its database of selfie images within the phone. The image processor then applies the appropriate beauty enhancements to the face.. Obviously, this would be the killer feature for users who want to get rid of wrinkles, make their eyes seem bigger, smoothen their skin and sharpen facial features.. Is Oppo aiming the S$699 R11s at women, with a champagne gold, black or pink-like finish, when it hits the shops here on December 2? Maybe, though men also take selfies.. The red Oppo R11s looks more like pink. The phone comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage that can be expanded with a microSD card. It also packs a 3,205mAh battery, which holds just a little less juice than the Samsung Galaxy Note 8’s 3,300mAh .. What puzzles me is the use of the less powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chip for a flagship device. It is certain beefy enough for everyday use today but for folks who seek the latest and greatest hardware, this might be a deal breaker.. Another head-scratcher is the lack of. This is a common technology used for anything from pairing Bluetooth devices to paying for groceries with Android Pay, so you’d expect it to be on a mid- to high-end phone today..

OPPO R11s 台灣上市記者會 OPPO R11s 高規格硬體操作 OPPO R11s 18:9全螢幕設計 OPPO R11s 承襲以往強勢功能 OPPO R11s ColorOS 3.2功能再升級 OPPO R11s AI臉部辨識最快0.08秒 OPPO R11s 相機前後2000萬智慧操作 OPPO R11s 全螢幕功能更強. 目前各家對於手機的螢幕方面，開始主打全面屏(全螢幕)的設計，就是取消實體Home鍵，拉高螢幕的屏佔比。 OPPO R11s 基本上就是從 OPPO R11 的升級進階版，最主要的差別在於螢幕拉到至18:9的6.01吋螢幕，握在手上的螢幕大上許多。在硬體方面的主要規格差異性不大，本次新增的特色除了全螢幕外，也有新增了一些小特色。例如外觀兩側的月牙彎設計，提高聲音的表現。安全性方面，也新增了正面 AI臉部辨識 ， 最快0.08秒 就能辨識完成。在前後2000萬的拍照方面多了點智慧，會判斷與拍照距離調整景深，並且依現場的光線自動切換鏡頭。此外，在美顏方面更保留一些臉部原有特徵細節，經過分析後才進行處理，避免過度美顏而讓照片效果失真。其他方面，OPPO R11s 承襲支援 4G+3G 雙卡雙待、 VOOC閃充 等。前陣子OPPO又與第54屆金馬獎合作成為唯一指定手機品牌，更推出了「 OPPO R11s 金馬雷雕限定版 」。. 在硬體規格方面， OPPO R11s 與 OPPO R11 方面則是可以說相同的，在OPPO R11s的規格中，R11s採用高通Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 處理器，擁有2.2GHz 64位元八核心處理器的規格，雖然不是8系列處理器，但是也有著不錯的表現。在效能技術方面，官方表示OPPO R11s可高效處理成像和視覺。在中國發表會中，還有提到與一些手遊公司進行最佳化處理，讓效能更為亮眼。其他方面，電池容量為 3205mAh 大電池容量，4GB記憶體與64GB容量空間，如果覺得不夠還能再外接最大支援 256GB 的micro SD卡。相機方面，採用f1.7雙超大光圈，後置雙主鏡頭一樣擁有2000萬與1600萬畫素鏡頭，會自動依場景的變化自動切換鏡頭。前置鏡頭為2000萬畫素，並搭載AI智慧美顏，在美顏方面有所改進，會自動辨識膚況再做特色美顏，這些稍後會有所介紹。. ▼ OPPO R11s 的彩盒為白色設計，在下方打上大大的 R11s 型號。. ▼ OPPO R11s 的耳機為白色設計，也提供了麥克風設計，嚴格說應該稱之為耳麥。. ▼ OPPO R11s 使用「AnTuTu Benchmark v6.2.7」測得的分數為121481分，屬於中階等級之手機規格。. ▼ OPPO R11s 使用「AnTuTu Benchmark v6.2.7」測得的相關硬體內容。. OPPO R11s 就是 OPPO R11 的進階版，外觀一樣採用金屬外殼，外觀方面R11s只有比R11略大一點點，沒有放在一起特別比較其實看不出來。但肉眼能夠一眼辨認出差異的，下方取消了Home鍵讓顯示螢幕整個變大了。原本的螢幕為解析度1920 x 1080的5.5吋，這次一次拉到成解析度 18:9 的 2160 x 1080 ，尺寸為 6.01吋 ，螢幕佔比(屏佔比)為 85.8% 。OPPO R11s在以往的手機中，也是OPPO裡第一支全螢幕(全面屏)的手機，可以塞滿整個畫面。. 在金屬機身的外觀上，背面取消了微縫天線2.0設計，改為來整面素質質感作法，這一點的美感見仁見智，老貓身邊的朋友就各有所喜愛。按鍵與連接介面則是完全相同，提供3.5吋音源接孔、micro USB連接埠，右側為電源開關鍵，左側為音量調整鍵。但另有一點設計比較特別的是，在 OPPO R11s 的上下兩側，有著往內彎的設計，OPPO稱之「 月牙彎 」設計。主要是當握住手機玩遊戲時，在側面的喇叭容易蓋住喇叭孔，而向內彎的設計會讓中間有一些空隙，藉此能讓聲音更為突出，強調提昇遊戲、影音使用效果。只是如果手真的比較肉一些，又習慣整個握緊的話，空隙仍舊會消失。但以老貓實際握感來說，的確可以保有中間的空隙，在聲音的音量表現方面真的是比之前的更為出色。. ▼ OPPO R11s 背後為金屬質感設計，雖然取消了微縫天線設計，整體別有一番質感。. ▼ OPPO R11s 的 18:9 全螢幕效果，可是更充分表現出顯示內容，OPPO R11s也是OPPO第一支全螢幕手機(全面屏手機)。. OPPO R11s 在硬體方面可以說承襲R11的特色，在插卡方面也是如此，OPPO R11s支援2卡槽設計，可以選擇安裝2張nano SIM卡，或者是1張SIM卡配1張micro SD卡(最高支援256GB)，對於多數使用者來說自行選擇要哪一種即可。SIM卡方面，4G+3G支援雙卡雙待，4G的會負責通話、網路通訊，另一張3G卡則為通話使用。在多數手機來說，2卡槽的設計由於非常方便，已經快變成基本的配備規格。. ▼ OPPO R11s 支援雙卡槽設計，可以放2張nano SIM卡，或者1張Sim卡配1張micro SD卡(最高支援256GB)。. ▼ 當插好2張SIM卡後， OPPO R11s 的撥號與簡訊頁面中，可以選擇要使用哪一張SIM卡來傳送。. 充電方面，OPPO R11s內建 3205mAh 大容量電池，比OPPO R11的3000mAh多了205mAh，電量方面提高了一些。不過老貓認為最重要的，就是 OPPO R11s 支援VOOC閃充，這已經是OPPO標配的規格。為什麼會這麼強調呢？OPPO在VOOC閃充方面的文宣通常為「充電5分鐘通話2小時」，主要的用意方面就是只要花一點時間就能從低電量快速的充電。但是為了讓使用者能夠快速了解充電速度，才有這樣的宣傳用語。實際測試方面，簡單的說從原本的不到5%開始充電，過了半個小時就已經超過6成的電量，速度真的非常快。只是VOOC閃充只限OPPO 原廠VOOC充電器才能達到以5V/4A的閃電充電，若接一般的充電器來說，最高也約只有5V/2A的規格。因此，在外出時也建議帶上OPPO VOOC充電器，就能隨時隨地都能進行閃電充電。. 作業系統方面OPPO R11s屬於 Android 系統陣營，但針對Android系統OPPO有再進行加強開發，推出自有的 ColorOS 系統，而OPPO R11s採用版本為ColorOS 3.2系統。在操作過程中，將所有App與桌應用面全部放在一起，全部以平面化的設計擺放，因此在點選App更為快速簡易。老貓也重提一下手勢操作，也就是在螢幕關閉的同時，可以直接用手指在螢幕上畫特定動作就能開啟特別的功能指令。在遊戲方面，還有推出「 遊戲加速 」功能，可以開啟最佳化設定，也加入螢幕橫放防誤觸、勿擾等功能，讓遊戲操作更能專心集中也更為順暢。. ▼ OPPO R11s 的設定頁面。. ▼ OPPO R11s 的設定頁面中，有一項為「使用說明」，內容有許多關於OPPO R11s的特色操作說明，. ▼ OPPO R11s 的「關於手機」頁面，OPPO R11s型號為CPH1719，採用ColorOS 3.2版本。. ▼ OPPO R11s 的「手勢體感」功能，透過手指的不同操作可以開啟許多功能，在螢幕關閉的休眠狀態中，也有許多預設操作螢幕休眠手勢可以開啟使用。. 值得一提的是，由於 OPPO R11s 為全螢幕(全面屏)設計，底下取消原本Home鍵位置改成螢幕區域，因此對於底部導覽列的任務鍵、Home鍵、返回鍵的操作都是改由螢幕來觸控。此時針對底部導覽列提供多種操作切換，設定的地方在「設定 → 其他設定 → 導覽鍵」，預設為開啟虛擬導覽鍵且不可隱藏，這種預設裝置對於所有人來說操作是最為簡單直覺，也就是下方擁有都會有一條導覽列。但是老貓認為如果一直以預設方式來操作有點可惜了OPPO R11s為的全螢幕設計，此時可以先開啟「 虛擬導覽鍵可隱藏 」，此時導覽列的左下方會多了向下的箭頭，點下去後就能縮起導覽列，在隱藏狀況下，由下往上一滑就能再呼叫出導覽列。. 若想再進階操作的話，可以開啟「 導覽手勢 」，此時會隱藏導覽鍵並在任何環境下皆不會再出現導覽鍵。其操作的方式，會依由下往上滑的不同位置而有不同的操作功能，例如在螢幕的右側區域由下往上滑，會是「返回鍵」的功能；在螢幕的左側區域由下往上滑，會是「控制中心」的功能；在螢幕的中間區域由下往上滑，會是「Home鍵」的功能，另外，同樣在螢幕的中間區域由下往上滑後停留1秒，則是「任務鍵」，會開啟當前的最近工作列表，而不是Home鍵。透過此功能的顯示操作，就讓OPPO R11s螢幕全部用來顯示之用，而不會切出一條導覽鍵。在實際使用上來說，可以參考老貓的 示範影片 ，會很容易就能理解。而實際的運用方面，除了OPPO內建的程式顯示能充分運用全螢幕畫面外，在部分程式中已經可以支援全螢幕的瀏覽，例如漫畫王、Netflix及目前在台灣很熱門的手遊「 傳說對決 」等皆可以充分運用全螢幕的效果，而Youtube方面還無法，這些都要等日後的更新才有機會。. 在操作方面， OPPO R11s 一樣擁有「 分割視窗 」功能，不過要先到設定頁面中，打開「套用分割畫面」，即可開啟功能。在操作時可以先開啟第1個App畫面，接下來長按住任務鍵(工作列表鍵)，就會在下方開啟另一個分割視窗選項，選則後就能變成上方開啟一個App，而下方還有另一個App視窗。這樣的優點是當想一邊聽Youbute音樂時，但又想做其他事，例如上網、收信、傳訊息時可以同時進行。否則如果以單一App畫面來呈現時，就無法同時邊進行邊聽音樂。換言之，就是OPPO R11s可以在同一個畫面中，同時開啟2個App來使用，不過並不是任意App都能支援，實際還是要測試才知道。在使用的環境上，切割成上下視窗後，可以拉動2個App中間的線來調整顯示比例，不過無法進行上下對調。老貓希望下個版本能夠加入對調的功能，甚至可以加入浮動視窗的功能，這樣在操作運用上還會更加方便。. 由於 OPPO R11s 正面已經沒有實體Home鍵，因此將指紋辨識移至手機背蓋，在握著手機的同時就能直接解鎖使用。除此之外，OPPO R11s加入了全新的識別方式：AI臉部辨識，透過臉部識別來判斷。在設定的頁面為「設定 → 指紋、臉部識別與密碼」，就能進行設定。在安全性方面，OPPO R11s提供 5種解鎖方式 ，分別為密碼、圖形、指紋、臉孔識別。最基本的密碼、圖形為擇一使用，預設密碼是4碼數字設定，但為了安全性可以自定義成其他含有英文的密碼。指紋可以儲存多組手指，不會只有單一儲存。. 臉部辨識方面，可以儲存一組臉孔，且在設定頁面下方有提醒臉部辨識的安全性低於指紋、圖形密碼、數字密碼，畢竟以目前各家技術來說，還是有一定的機率被其他容貌接近的人來進行解鎖。臉部辨識記錄過程中，老貓實際測試不管有無戴眼鏡，都能順利解鎖。官方表示0.08秒就能解鎖，而老貓 實際測試 是只要將臉對準螢幕就立即開啟進入桌面( 測試影片 )，完全沒有感到延遲。而臉部辨識過程中，實際測試閉眼仍然是可以進入系統內，而雙胞胎方面老貓就沒有實測了，目前似乎也沒有廠商可以完全克服此點。真的要獨一無二的安全性，老貓認為還是以 文字密碼最為保險 ，其他都是以方便性為主。. ▼ OPPO R11s 可以儲存指紋外，在這次更加入了「 AI臉部辨識 」，設定完成後最快只要0.08秒就能登入系統。. OPPO 非常重視照相的效果因此也會以「 Camera Phone 」來宣傳， OPPO R11s 手機的雙主鏡頭採用1600萬或2000萬畫素鏡頭，並同時擁有，F1.7雙超大光圈，讓更多光源進入感應器中；而前置自拍鏡頭則是擁有2000萬畫素鏡頭與F2.0大光圈。. OPPO R11s 在一般拍照中，有縮時攝影、錄影、拍照、人像、全景、專業共 6種模式 ，其中最常用的為拍照與人像。但別看到主鏡頭的雙鏡頭就在思考說要如何進行切換，因為OPPO R11s 會自動依周圍環境的光線，智慧切換雙主鏡頭，不必特別去研究如何進行切換。換句話說，在一般的拍照中，不用在意1600萬或2000萬畫素，甚至長焦或短焦鏡頭這些專有名詞，直接選擇「拍照」模式就夠了，非常簡單。在主鏡頭的拍照模式中，比R11多了美顏效果，共有1~6階模式可以選擇。在人像的模式中，一樣支援景深效果，也就是說主體為清晰，而背後會被模擬化處理，拍起來的效果別有一番質感。特別的是， OPPO R11s 多了2種人像景深效果，可以拍攝半身與全身照，並且智慧感應與人的距離，切換不同層次的景深效果，與R11相比會稍微多一些層次感。. ▼ OPPO R11s 在自拍環境中，可以也提供智能與1-6階美顏設定切換。. ▼ 以下為 OPPO R11s 的相關照片拍照，點實際照片會另外開啟原始圖片，會發現在夜晚的效果中也不錯。. ▼ 此2張為 OPPO R11s 的智能美顏自拍，並且搭配景深效果顯示。. 在型號的命名上來說， OPPO R11s 與 OPPO R11 相比只是多個「 s 」，其實是基於原本的硬體規格，再進行一些升級修改，不過當然最明顯的還是於螢幕的尺寸，也是OPPO第一支進入 全螢幕 (全面屏)設計的手機。雖然在這領域中，OPPO不是前兩三家進入全螢幕手機領域。在中國的發表會中OPPO提出「 敢為天下後，後中爭先 」，強調雖然是後面才進入，但是要在這領域中做出特色。在操作中來說，老貓有特別提到對於導覽列來說，就提供了多種操作方式，好好運用全螢幕帶來的顯示與方便性。外觀採用金屬質感，並搭配新一代的月牙彎設計，讓握起來有不同的特別感受。而常見的「充電5分鐘通話2小時」的VOOC閃充，也是OPPO的獨家特有特色。安全性更加入了「 AI臉部辨識 」，看一下鏡頭最快只要0.08秒就能立即解鎖來操作，這些差異性都讓 OPPO R11s 更為出色。. ▼ OPPO R11s 與 OPPO R11巴薩版 比較，可以看到OPPO R11s將指紋辨識器移到金屬背蓋。. 回到拍照方面，主要拍照的雙鏡頭設計，使用者也不用去思考要採用哪一顆鏡頭拍照，直接點選「拍照」模式最為簡單，而人像模式中，OPPO R11s的景深模式更為強大，還能進行半身與全身的景深拍照。自拍方面更提供「AI智慧美顏」，透過臉上的254個特徵點，自動依性別、年齡、膚質、膚色多重標準分析，讓美顏效果更真。OPPO R11s這麼多的特色，老貓就不再重新介紹一次，有興趣可以再往上檢視的眾多章節。如果說目前還在猶豫要買OPPO R11或OPPO R11s來說，老貓會建議如果想要全螢幕或更特別的拍照效果，直接選擇「OPPO R11s」就對了。另外一題，前陣子OPPO又與第54屆金馬獎合作成為唯一指定手機品牌，推出了「 OPPO R11s 金馬雷雕限定版 」，提供專屬訂製外盒、機背雷雕、佈景主題以及手機鈴聲，感覺起來更有質感！可惜只提供給主持人與入圍者，我們在市面上是買不到的。.
