Vivo X20 and Vivo X20 Plus Official: Full-Screen Displays, Impressive Cameras & A Few Other Tricks. by Habeeb Onawole 5 months ago 14. Vivo X20 and Vivo X20 Plus Design Vivo X20 and Vivo X20 Plus Specs Face Wake Vivo X20 and Vivo X20 Plus Cameras Vivo X20 and Vivo X20 Plus Pricing and Availability. The Vivo X20 was unveiled today in China. The new smartphone is Vivo’s second full-screen smartphone, coming weeks after the announcement of the Vivo V7 Plus in India.. The Vivo X20 and X20 Plus feature a 3D arc design that is designed to provide a comfortable grip in your palm. The 1.8mm U-shaped antenna lines are seamlessly integrated into the device using a new generation nano-injection molding process. The rest of the body is finished with an ultra-fine zirconium sand spray process that gives it a silky smooth feel.. The Vivo X20 has a 6.01 inch 18:9 display that occupies 85.3% of the front of the phone. It is powered by the Snapdragon 660 paired with 4GB of RAM. Owners will be able to choose between 64GB or 128GB of expandable storage. The X20 has an AK4376A for HiFi audio and packs a 3245mAh battery under the hood.. The Vivo X20 Plus has a larger 6.43-inch 2160 x 1080 super AMOLED display crammed in a 5.85-inch body. It is powered by the same Snapdragon 660 mobile platform and packs the same amount of RAM. However, storage is limited to 64GB but one can add up to and additional 256GB via a MicroSD card slot.. The X20 Plus also differs in the camera aspect as its sensors have OIS. It has an ES9318 DAC + amp for Hi-Fi audio. Due to the bigger screen, it packs a 3905mAh battery capacity.. There is dual SIM support, Bluetooth 5.0, dual band WiFi, and a micro USB port for connectivity on both devices. There are also fingerprint scanners on the back of the phones that support payment and can control the cameras too.. Both the Vivo X20 And Vivo X20 Plus run FunTouch OS 3.0 based on Android. There is a built-in AI assistant that learns your usage pattern, channeling processing power to your most used apps.. There is also a new Vivo Game Engine that greatly improves game-play even for very demanding games. The game engine also makes sure that incoming calls or notifications do not affect game-play. If you need to respond to messages from chat apps, a floating and re-sizeable window of the app will appear. It seems only WeChat and QQ are supported for now.. There are two ways to unlock the X20 – using the fingerprint scanner or using the new Face Wake feature. Face Wake is said to unlock the device in just 0.1s. Vivo claims it detects up to 128 different facial features before proceeding to unlock the phone.. Vivo like its sibling OPPO, makes camera-centric phones and the X20 and X20 Plus don’t disappoint. There are dual rear cameras on both phones in a 12MP + 5MP combination. The 12MP f/1.8 sensor is unique as it can take images up to 24MP. Pair that with the 5MP secondary sensor and you get high quality bokeh images. The 12MP f/2.0 dual-pixel front facing camera uses the same technology and also takes portrait images.. Vivo also says it has worked on an image sensor processor unit it calls Vivo Image Cube. This is actually a 256MB dual-core image sensor processor (DSP).. LG Display’s OLEDs Coming on Premium Phone from Huawei, OPPO, Vivo and Xiaomi. The Vivo X20 will start at ¥2998 (~$455) for the 4GB RAM + 64GB model. For double the storage, Vivo is asking for ¥3398 (~$515). The Plus model will cost ¥3498. Both phones will be available in gold, rose gold and matte black..

CNET también está disponible en español.. First phone with in-screen fingerprint scanner gets a name. The Vivo X20 Plus UD's world-first tech is headed for its home market of China.. by January 24, 2018 11:18 PM PST. This Vivo phone could launch a smartphone trend. See the first in-screen fingerprint scanner in action. Quick specs Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 6.43-inch SuperAMOLED display (2,160x1,080 pixels) Dual 12-megapixel rear camera, 12-megapixel front camera 4GB RAM, 128GB storage 3,905mAh embedded battery. When it was unveiled at CES 2018, the Vivo X20 Plus UD didn't have a name or a launch date, but the world's first phone with a fingerprint scanner under the display is now available in China.. It's not a completely new phone, though -- the X20 Plus UD is an updated version of the X20 Plus, with the aforementioned tech instead of a rear fingerprint scanner. To unlock the X20 Plus UD, it's as simple as putting your finger on the screen , though the tradeoff is you won't be able to use a thick screen protector. Don't fret though, it comes bundled with a compatible one.. This Vivo phone could launch a smartphone trend. Specs wise, it's the same as the X20 Plus, which means an 18:9, 6.43-inch Super AMOLED display (2,160x1,080 pixels), Qualcomm's Snapdragon 660 processor, 4GB RAM and two rear 12-megapixel cameras. It will retail for around 3,600 Chinese yuan, which converts to $570, £400 or AU$700.. While the X20 Plus UD the first phone to use the under-screen tech, expect to see more phones sport a similar feature come Mobile World Congress 2018 in March, where big brands such as Samsung and LG will have new phones to show off. Also, given Vivo's close relationship with Oppo and OnePlus , it's a good guess you will see phones from these two Chinese phone brands with under-screen fingerprint scanners pretty soon.. For now though, if you're thinking of getting one, you'll have to wait, as this phone is only available in China, with no word on when it will be available in Vivo's international markets. There's always the option of third-party online retailers, but the phone will likely come without Google's Play Store installed, so be warned.. Visit manufacturer site for details..

CNET también está disponible en español.. First phone with in-screen fingerprint scanner sells Jan. The Vivo phone we saw earlier this month is real, but it could be hard to get.. January 22, 2018 12:50 PM PST. Vivo posted this event flyer for its X20 Plus UD phone.. The world's first phone with an in-screen fingerprint scanner finally has a name, and a birth date. The Vivo X20 Plus UD goes on sale Jan. We first saw the one-of-a-kind tech at. CES , the world's largest technology show. Chinese phone maker Vivo showed us a preproduction device that scans your fingerprint when you. place your finger on the screen. There's no home button, just a target on the lock screen that you tap when you want to unlock the device -- and then it's out of your way. Although Vivo's phone will be the first to market with this innovation, we expect it to kick off a trend in 2018 and beyond. Currently, almost every phone on the planet has a physical fingerprint scanner that you press to get into your phone: either south of the screen, integrated in the power button, or on the phone's back.. Apple's iPhone X is one notable exception -- it uses Face ID to unlock the phone, and has no fingerprint scanner whatsoever.. This Vivo phone could launch a smartphone trend. Both the iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy S8 were rumored to get the embedded sensor, and didn't. With the Galaxy S9 launching in February in Barcelona, Spain, Samsung and other device makers will have a chance to show off their use of the technology , which was created by components company Synaptics.. The Vivo X20 Plus UD is a variation on the previously announced X20 Plus, so expect it to have the same 6.43-inch AMOLED display with thin bezels, a Snapdragon octa-core processor, dual rear cameras and 4GB of RAM -- the in-screen fingerprint sensor is really the standout feature.. Vivo will announce the X20 Plus UD Jan. local time in China; it's unclear if it will come to other markets outside of Vivo's home country.. See the first in-screen fingerprint scanner in action.

Vivo X20 Plus UD with the world's first under-display fingerprint sensor launched in China for CNY 3,600. Jan 25, 2018 09:33 AM IST. The world's first smartphone with an under-the-display fingerprint sensor, Vivo X20 Plus UD, has been launched in China, with a price tag of CNY 3,600 (approximately Rs 36,000). For quite some time it was. speculated that this new fingerprint sensor technology would debut on either a Samsung or an Apple. smartphone but Chinese smartphone maker Vivo surprised everyone and. the device at at CES 2018, showcasing the technology that was developed by Synaptics .. The advantage of something like this is that smartphone makers will have plenty of room to increase the display size while keeping the fingerprint sensor on the front (which in our opinion is the optimal place for putting it). While reviewing the device, The Verge. pointed out that this new fingerprint reader is slightly slower than the conventional fingerprint sensor, but as with every other fingerprint scanner, it is expected to improve. The Vivo X20 Plus UD has a 6.4 inch 18:9 aspect ratio OLED display. Under the hood, we find that the phone has a. Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor, with 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded via a micro-SD card. 165.2 x 80.02 x 7.35 mm and weighs 183.1 grams.. In the optics department, the phone has a dual-camera setup at the back with. main one having а 12 МP sensor and a f/1.8 lens,. and the second being 5 MP sensor with f/2.2. features a 12 MP front camera and LED flash.. In terms of connectivity, the phone has a dual-hybrid SIM slot with 4G VoLTE, a USB Type-C port, Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. The entire setup is powered by a 3,905 mAh battery and the phone is available only in a matte black finish. Vivo X20 Plus UD is being sold only in China, but it could be possible that a phone with similar under-the-display fingerprint technology is launched in India since the country is a big market for Vivo..

Vivo X20 Plus UD with in-display fingerprint sensor discloses its full specs at Tenaa. Adrian Diaconescu January 16, 2018 7:35 am. Vivo made a big splash at CES 2018 in Las Vegas last week as the world’s first smartphone manufacturer to integrate a working under-display fingerprint scanner into a “full-production” mobile device.. But what Synaptics’ “top five” OEM partner neglected to mention was the actual name of this groundbreaking Android handset. Or anything about its specifications apart from the security, accuracy and speed of that trailblazing fingerprint reader squeezed between the phone’s “borderless” OLED panel and printed circuit board.. Then again, a recent China Compulsory Certificate (3C) approval strongly hinted at Vivo X20 Plus UD branding for this upcoming trendsetter, which in turn suggested a list of features similar to that of the “regular” X20 Plus .. Now the same (overlong) name has surfaced on Tenaa’s official website, and China’s FCC-equivalent regulatory agency pairs the moniker with some very familiar photos and specs.. This is indeed a dead ringer for the Vivo X20 Plus, bar the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. It’s therefore safe to expect the in-display fingerprint-recognizing Vivo X20 Plus UD to see daylight soon with a “FullView” 6.43-inch Full HD+ OLED screen in tow, as well as a Snapdragon 660 processor, 4GB RAM and 128GB internal storage.. There will be two cameras placed on this big guy’s back, sporting 12 and 5MP lenses, with a single 12 MP shooter in charge of selfie action, a 3800mAh battery responsible for keeping the lights on between charges, and Android 7.1.1 Nougat running the software show, at least at this particular pre-launch stage.. Rumor has it the Vivo X20 Plus UD will cost the rough equivalent of $575 (3,698 yuan) in China, which is only slightly more than the regional retail price of an X20 Plus that offers half the aforementioned internal storage space. But the question on everyone’s lips is will we ever see this (widely) released in the Western Hemisphere?.
