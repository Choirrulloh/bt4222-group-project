ZTE Blade A6 - budget and tasteful. The low price segment for the Chinese company ZTE has long been one of the most profitable. However, unnecessary attention to the expensive devices of the Nubia and AXON lines turned into a loss of a significant share of customers. To regain leadership became the most difficult task because of the presence in the value category of incredibly balanced products of such giants as Xiaomi, Meizu, Huawei and others. However, the hero of today's review shows that hopes for success have not yet left the producer.. The appearance of the novelty is attractive, although it is standard. A fingerprint scanner, a curved glass of a good 5-inches display , a slim body made of pleasant to a touch polycarbonate, a stylish metal edging - all these should rejoice us. However, the above list does not cause a sense of surprise or delight. The screen is made by the IPS -technology, an HD -resolution gives the image excellent detailization, and the contrast, brightness levels exceed those of many opponents. However, in direct sunlight, the picture still fades fairly, remaining visible at the same time.. The gadget's performance can not be called a record, but for most applications it is sufficient. The Mediatek MT6737 processor, 2GB of RAM and the Mali T720MP2 graphics chip allow you to run even the newest, resource-demanding games, but the user shouldn't rely on decent graphics settings. The volume of ROM at 16GB is small even for storing a couple of full-length movies, so installing a microSD -card slot is a reasonable step of the developer.. The cameras of the device are remarkable 13 and 5-megapixel photomodules , which guarantee excellent in terms of clarity and naturalness of colors of photos in daylight. In the evening, the results of the photo session will be less interesting. The battery capacity at 2500mAh is optimally combined with the above characteristics. It will be enough for about five hours of active screen time. Support for 4G, OTG, actual Android Nougat, though are not creating an ideal low-cost device, but increase the attractiveness of a technology-based, topical smartphone..

Single Review, online available, Very Long, Date: 11/13/2017. This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. ZTE is short for Zhong Xing Telecommunication Equipment Company Limited, which was founded in China in 1985. The product range includes, for example, USB sticks, routers, smartphones and tablets..

Compartir ZTE Blade A6, una gama económica con una enorme batería de 5.000 mAh por menos de 200 euros. Ficha técnica del ZTE Blade A6. Así es el ZTE Blade A6. Versiones y precios del ZTE Blade V6. Poco a poco vamos dejando atrás el periodo vacacional, salvo por aquellos que tengan días libres en el mes de septiembre. Agosto va tocando a su fin y cada fabricante prepara su catálogo para afrontar lo que suele llamarse "la vuelta al cole" pese a que los destinatarios de los teléfonos móviles presentados no suelen ser los más jóvenes.. ZTE sabe moverse entre los teléfonos económicos, los que suelen acabar asociados a las distintas operadoras con planes ventajosos asociados a sus tarifas, bien subvencionados en su totalidad o con cuota inicial. Como el ZTE Blade A6 que ahora llega al mercado y en España estará por ahora atado a MediaMarkt a través de un acuerdo de distribución exclusivo. Un terminal económico que aterriza con el Snapdragon 435 a bordo. TFT de 5,2 pulgadas FullHD 424 píxeles por pulgada. Snapdragon 435 de ocho núcleos a 1,4GHz. 13 megapíxeles con flash LED y autofocus. Lector de huellas dactilares, Bluetooh 4.0, radio FM, Dual SIM LTE. 147 x 71 x 8,9 milímetros y 160 gramos. El ZTE Blade A6 cuenta con una pantalla de 5,2 pulgadas con resolución FullHD. Un panel TFT de 1.920 x 1.080 píxeles con 424 píxeles por pulgada de densidad. En cuanto al procesador, el Snapdragon 435 de Qualcomm, ocho núcleos a 1,4GHz y 1,1GHz acompañado a su vez por 2GB de memoria RAM y por 16GB de memoria interna que podremos ampliar con una microSD de hasta 128GB como máximo.. El equipo de cámaras también entra dentro de lo que esperaríamos de un terminal de línea económica. Hablamos de una cámara trasera de 13 megapíxeles con sensor CMOS y autofocus, además de una lente frontal para selfies y videollamadas que cuenta con 8 megapíxeles y un sistema de enfoque diferente al trasero: fixed focus o enfoque al infinito.. Lo más interesante de este Blade A6 de ZTE es su enorme batería de 5.000 mAh con carga rápida. Con Android N en su interior, el ZTE Blade A6 aterriza con una enorme batería de 5.000 mAh con carga rápida que lleva al terminal hasta los 160 gramos, el peso de un cuerpo de 147 x 71 x 8,9 milímetros de grosor. No falta el lector de huellas ni la radio FM, ni tampoco el jack de auriculares de 3,5 milímetros.. Además, estamos ante un teléfono doble SIM para poder conectarnos a redes LTE y disfrutar, entre otras cosas, de llamadas VoLTE. Un teléfono bastante completo y con la potencia adecuada para una línea económica que, como comentábamos antes, ahora llega al catálogo del fabricante oriental y aprovecha para debutar en países como España.. Tal y como comentábamos al principio del artículo, el ZTE Blade A6 no sólo es oficial sino que está a la venta. Además de los posibles acuerdos alcanzados por el fabricante con las distintas operadoras, el teléfono puede adquirirse de forma libre por 179 euros, un precio que encontraremos en MediaMarkt , donde se pone a la venta de forma exclusiva en color negro.. Estaremos atentos a los distintos precios con operadoras, de producirse su anuncio, y a un posible aumento de la oferta con otros distribuidores. Como por ejemplo Amazon, uno de los grandes recursos a la hora de hacerse con un nuevo dispositivo y que podría incorporar el teléfono en un futuro..

Jules Wang August 13, 2017 10:48 pm. All’s quiet on the Axon front , but that doesn’t mean ZTE is out of business. In fact, after making good faith efforts to repair its image as seen through US regulators’ lenses, it’s passing some required documents into the FCC for a mid-range smartphone that’s bound to have lasting power.. The Blade A6, as it is explicitly named in the Office of Engineering and Technology files , has a full suite of information and tidbits — see external and internal photos above. Through matching part numbers, we find that the phone has a 5,000mAh battery, a Snapdragon 435 and 16GB of flash storage from SanDisk. Buyers will have to settle for being behind the times with a Micro-B connector and 3.5mm headphone jack. It does have a fingerprint sensor, though.. It’ll be interesting to see where this lands in the US, if it even makes it here in the first place. While GizBot points out a. fair bit of band support for most of the networks, we’ll probably have to look at prepaid carriers for this one.. There’s a second device in this mess that’s shrouded in mystery. We don’t exactly know the silicon runs on the “Z982,” but it does well with high-600 single-core runs and mid-2,000 multi-core scores.. Gizbot stakes this as the Snapdragon 430, but we’ll stay back from that claim here. We do know that we have 2GB of RAM and Android 7.1.1 on-board.. So, what to make of this all? ZTE knows where its money is being made as a sturdy option in prepaid and budget lineups. These devices specifically? Not much other than they exist in some form. We’ll have to see more down the line.. battery , Benchmarks , Blade A6 , certification , FCC , Geekbench , News , Specs , ZTE. battery , Benchmarks , Blade A6 , certification , FCC , Geekbench , News , Specs , ZTE.
