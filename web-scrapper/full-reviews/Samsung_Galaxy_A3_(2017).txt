Samsung has created another solid mid-range smartphone contender, and this one looks and feels more like its high-end brothers than ever.. Samsung Galaxy A3 price and release date Launch price: £279 ($250, around AU$455) SIM free Current price: £225 ($250, around AU$375) Release date: January 2017 Dressed to impress A premium design Water and dust resistance Design and display Design mimics Galaxy S7 nicely Bright and colourful 4.7-inch AMOLED display 720p resolution doesn’t seem sufficient Thanks to Carphone Warehouse for providing us with a Samsung Galaxy A5 for review. Samsung has significantly closed the design gap between its top and mid-range phones with the new Samsung Galaxy A3 2017. But it's not the only manufacturer making desirable phones for an affordable price.. In fact, the South Korean firm isn't the front runner in the budget market with strong competition from the likes of Motorola, Huawei, Honor, Oppo and Wileyfox (in the UK).. What Samsung has done here though is clever, it's taken the design language from its premium Galaxy S range and brought it to an entry-level handset - which means you don't feel like you're completely missing out if the likes of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are financially out of reach.. Weight : 138g Dimensions : 135.4 x 66.2 x 7.9mm OS : Android 7 Screen size : 4.7 inches Resolution : 720 x 1280 CPU : Exynos 7870 RAM : 2GB Storage : 16GB Battery : 2,350mAh Rear camera : 13MP Front camera : 8MP. The Samsung Galaxy A3 launch price was £279 ($250, around AU$455) for this SIM free 2017 edition, which is a little more than half the price of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge .. Since its arrival though, the price has dropped if you shop around, and we've seen the Galaxy A3 as low as £217 on Amazon. - which represents a healthy price drop.. This price point puts it in direct competition with a host of impressive mid-rangers, such as the Moto G5 Plus , Wileyfox Swift 2 X and Honor 9 Lite .. The Galaxy A3 is widely available in the UK, with major networks and retailers and networks stocking the handset, while in the US it can be found online at the likes of Amazon.. Samsung's biggest achievement with the Galaxy A3 2017 has been to make a phone that looks and feels a lot like the Samsung Galaxy S7 for a couple of hundred pounds less.. We'll go into the specifics of the A3’s design in the following section. Suffice to say that it follows the design language of its premium brother to a quite impressive degree.. It's got an all-metal rim, a familiar curved '3D Glass' back, and even a slightly shimmery effect to its front bezels. Anyone who's used a Samsung Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S7 for an extended period will be able to detect the differences, but it's a creditable approximation regardless.. You even get IP68 certification, which means that the Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 is as resistant to water and dust ingress as its big brother. That's not something we're accustomed to seeing on cheaper phones, so it’s a notable bragging point for the new A3.. Samsung seems determined that you won’t easily spot the difference through a cursory glance of the Galaxy A3's spec sheet either, with the presence of a custom Exynos 7870 CPU, a 13MP main camera, and a front-mounted fingerprint sensor all suggestive of higher end thrills.. Closer scrutiny of those components affirms their mid-range status, but they're not found wanting at this price point.. One forward-looking component the Samsung Galaxy S7 doesn’t have that the Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 does is a USB-C port. It's not a massive bragging point, but it's certainly the standard we're expecting to see all mid to high-end Android phones adopting in 2017.. From a practical perspective it's much easier to plug in a charger or cable without looking, thanks to USB-C's reversible nature.. We've already acknowledged that the Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 does a great job appropriating the design language of the Samsung Galaxy S7 with relatively few compromises. But more importantly, it simply feels great in the hand.. At 7.9mm thick and weighing 138g, and combined with that metal and glass build, it has a similar 'just-so' heft to the one you get with Apple's iPhones. You know you're holding something of quality, but it won't remind you of the fact when it's sat in your pocket.. Meanwhile, that 3D Glass back is more than just a visual flourish - it ensures that the phone sits nicely in the curve of your hand.. We're still not convinced that an all-glass back is a particularly practical idea in a phone, though. In fact, we're pretty sure it isn't.. It makes the phone feel precariously slippery when you're fishing it out of your pocket, and we suspect it will be extra-prone to scuffing and cracking should that evasiveness ever manifest itself and it heads for the floor.. We're not massively enamored with the Gold Sand color our test unit came in, but that's obviously a subjective matter. There are Black Sky and Blue Mist options for those who like their phones to be a little more understated, and a Peach Cloud option for those who, well, like pink.. We have decidedly mixed feelings about the Samsung Galaxy A3 2017's display. On paper, its 4.7-inch Super AMOLED screen with 720p resolution might sound like the kind of compact screen that can give the iPhone 7 a run for its money. OK, so it's got that super-saturated look that AMOLED panels are known for. And you also get Samsung's usual display options, so you can tweak it according to your preference (tip: choose Basic if you want to tone things down). But that 720p resolution doesn’t seem to do this AMOLED panel any favours on the sharpness count.. It's far from bad, but anyone who's grown used to 1080p screens - as long-time Android users no doubt have - will probably notice the drop in detail, even with the smaller-than-usual screen size.. We moved straight to the A3 from using an iPhone 6S as our daily driver, which has exactly the same sized screen with a similar number of pixels, but even then the Samsung felt decidedly fuzzy and lacking a certain clarity.. We would feel churlish complaining about this perfectly adequate resolution if it weren't for the simple fact that many sub-£200/$250/AU$300 Android phones come with 1080p screens.. The difference in experience may have a genuine impact if you're an avid mobile media consumer, which we’ll discuss later.. One major advantage of the Galaxy A3's AMOLED display is that Samsung has been able to implement its Always On Display feature.. This means you can have a little clock or calendar permanently displayed in plain, dim lettering, complete with small icons for incoming notifications. It’s great for a surreptitious glance when you’re in a meeting or watching a movie.. Next Page What's it like to use?.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Victor Hristov. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction For a third time in a row, Samsung starts the year by releasing three new mid-range phones of the Galaxy A series, and the 2017 edition of the lineup is the most impressive yet. Samsung has made three phones that have an exceptional look and feel, just like its most expensive phones, and the new Galaxy A3 (2017) is the most compact, the most affordable and the cutest of the three. The new A3 (2017) is a 4.7-inch phone with a Super AMOLED display and a look nearly identical to that of the Galaxy S7 with the same stylish glass and metal construction, and even the same high water protection rating, a first in a phone in this price class. Clearly, Samsung has taken some shortcuts: the new A3 uses a less powerful chip than the top dogs, features less storage and makes some other compromises, but can its low price make up for that? Let’s find out and take a deeper look. In the box: Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) model SM-A320F User Manual SIM ejector tool USB-A to USB-C cable White Samsung earbuds with replaceable rubber tips Wall charger (7.75 watts peak, 5V and 1.55A) Design Designed to near perfection, with a curved glass back, metal frame and full-on water-protection. The Galaxy A3 (2017) is as good as phones get in terms of looks. We have the beautiful, deep black glossy version up for review, a glass-and-metal construction that feels so solidly, so well put together, we’d forgive you if you mistake it for a much more expensive phone (it helps that it also looks almost exactly like the S7). With a slight curve on the back and a compact size, the new A3 feels extremely comfortable in the hand. It’s thinner than you’d expect and it’s nicely balanced, with some weight to it that prevents it from feeling too airy or hollow: it feels monolithic. Every little aspect of this phone feels thought out, and even the side buttons are made out of metal and have nice travel and feel. The one practical downside of having a beautiful glass phone, however, is the way its back catches fingerprints with an incredible ease and quickly turns into a smudgy mess that you have to clean or protect with a case. This was very noticeable on the black version that we have for review, but it might not be so noticeable with other colors: Samsung is also offering the phone in Gold Sand, Blue Mist, and Peach Cloud. Another key feature of the A3 is its very compact physical size: it has a 4.7-inch display, but it also has very narrow side bezels, so overall the phone is actually even smaller than the already compact iPhone 7. It’s not quite iPhone SE like, but it is still definitely very comfortable for single-handed use. We’re also glad to see that Samsung has finally done away with microUSB, and even this affordable new A3 has the cool new reversible USB-C port. The handset also has a good ol’ 3.5mm headphone jack for your headphones, speakers and AUX cables. But the new A3’s special ‘superpower’ is without a doubt its water proofing. The phone is officially IP68 certified, it’s one of the cheapest phones we’ve ever seen with this new feature. The IP68 rating means that the phone is tested and will withstand water damage when submerged as deep as 5 feet (1.5 meters) for up to 30 minutes. The benefits are clear: you don’t need to worry about getting your phone wet, you can take it for those summer pool-side parties and it will even survive the surprisingly common drop in the toilet. Display A 4.7” Super AMOLED HD screen with surprisingly great colors and quality. The Galaxy A3 (2017) features a 4.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. And it’s a PenTile display as well, meaning that it has less color in every pixel than a regular RGB screen , so it’s not as sharp as one. Is this a big deal? Not really: this is definitely not the sharpest screen out there, and if you look up close you can see slightly jagged edges on some icons and most notable in text, but when using your phone regularly this is barely noticeable. These days, it is not resolution and sharpness that lacks in phones, but good colors. That’s why we were pleasantly surprised to see the affordable Galaxy A3 sport some very good-looking colors. The screen itself is nicely smooth, so your finger glides effortlessly on the glass, and overall colors are well tuned to the sRGB color standard that is used universally for photos and videos. Whites are just a little bit on the blue side, and everything is just a bit brighter than ideal due to the lower gamma, but overall this screen is really great for a phone of this price class. Samsung also allows users to change the color reproduction of the screen: go into Settings > Display > Screen Mode, and you get to choose from four different modes. The Adaptive mode brings color saturation up, making for more eye-popping, impressive visuals that are not that realistic, while Basic is the closest to industry accepted standard and we recommend using this mode. The screen can also get very bright, so it’s easy to use the phone outdoors under the harsh sunlight. It can also neatly go down to just 1 nit (the lowest level we measure) at night, which makes it easier on the eyes and more pleasant to use. Samsung now includes the useful Blue light filter in the new A3. You can customize it to automatically start working at night and ensure that you have no blue light beaming at you and preventing your brain from making the chemicals needed for you to fall asleep. The A3 also has ‘Always-on Display’ mode that shows you the time, date and the type of missed notifications even when your screen is locked (but not the actual notifications). The letters are well contrasted and easy to see, but be warned – this will have a noticeable impact on battery life.. 5.33 x 2.61 x 0.31 inches. 135.4 x 66.2 x 7.9 mm. 5.3 x 2.57 x 0.29 inches. 134.5 x 65.2 x 7.3 mm. 5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 inches. 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm. 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.3 inches. 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6 mm.

Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) Compare.

It’s not quite iPhone SE like, but it is still definitely very comfortable for single-handed use.". So with my limited command over English, I presume this means even though the A3 is smaller than the iphoneSE, the iphoneSE is more comfortable for single-handed use. Am i wrong in thinking this is a self-contradictory statement?. (Posts: 5478; Member since: 10 Feb 2012). posted on 13 Mar 2017, 12:07.

I bought this phone a few months ago. At first I was impressed, now however, far from it. The charger isn't working properly, the front camera isn't great and the phone is slow and will not allow me to save anything to my SD card. It also recently froze and made a buzzing sound for 2 hours.. Rated 3 out of. Used it for 3 months now and there are few things I don't like about this phone:. - fingerprint sensor useless, works about once in 7-8 attempts. - camera takes a lot of out-of-focus pictures. Candy crush saga takes almost twice as long to open than on my 2.5 year old iPhone 6 which has much worse tech specs).. Considering that I've paid over £250 for it I was expecting much more. I'm sure you can get same specs for £100-£150 so stay away from this one until price drops by £100.. Rated 2 out of. Battery life is pretty underwhelming for a phone these days, the UI is poorly thought out compared to other mobile phones, the fingerprint sensor is poor and is constantly asking me to wipe it. Build quality seems good although also means it feels a little heavy. As seems to happen, Samsung are coasting on their brand name again and this isn't good value at all. Rated 4 out of.

Samsung has updated it’s A series phones for 2017, which comprises the A3, A5 and A7. The bestseller is the A3, which is the smallest of the three models with a 4.7in screen like the iPhone 7. We've put the new Samsung Galaxy A3 through its paces to find out how it compares with its predecessors, rivals and bigger siblings to help you decide whether or not to buy it. Read on for our full Samsung Galaxy A3 review.. The new Samsung Galaxy A3 is available to buy now priced at £279. Its bigger counterparts, the A5 and A7, are priced at £399 and £499 respectively.. There are rivals available that come close to matching the specs and performance of the Galaxy A3 with a lower price tag, some of which we'll talk about later in this review, but if you're set on a Samsung phone we think this is a good option, particularly when you consider its good-looking design.. Plus, we expect the price of the A3 to drop quite significantly quite quickly, so, if you're willing to wait, the price tag will likely soon be more appealing.. If you're after the Peach Cloud colour option, you'll find that exclusively over at Carphone Warehouse here.. The first thing that struck us about the new A3 and its bigger siblings is its design, which now looks even more like Samsung's flagship Galaxy S7 thanks to its slightly curved back and rounded edges that feel brilliantly comfortable in the hand.. We're not the biggest fans of the shiny back because it soon becomes covered in fingerprints, but the lighter colours tend to hide those quite well so we'd recommend avoiding the black model if that's something that bothers you. The model we reviewed was gold and we found that it did really well at hiding the fingerprints. There's also a blue model and the Carphone Warehouse exclusive Peach Cloud option too .. The Galaxy A3 has actually increased in thickness in this latest update. Last year's model was 7.3mm and this year's measures 7.9mm. It's a tiny difference though so you're very unlikely to notice, and we think 7.9mm is slim enough.. That extra thickness could in part be due to the small battery bump and the addition of a fingerprint sensor, which is new for the A3 this year.. Samsung has also moved the phone's speaker from the bottom of the device to the right side after last year's move from the back to the bottom. This time the idea is that the position of the speaker means you'll never cover it up, whether you're playing a game or watching a video and it works brilliantly. One of the most exciting things about the A3's design and build is its new IP68 waterproof rating like the Samsung Galaxy S7, which is a real boon for the clumsy like us and will put your mind at rest if you're out and about with your phone in the unpredictable British weather. This rating makes the A3 waterproof up to 1.5 metres for 30 minutes, so you could even take it into the pool on holiday if you're feeling brave enough.. You might also like: Xiaomi Mi Mix smartphone review. The Galaxy A3's 4.7in screen hits the sweet spot for us when it comes to screen size. Most flagship phones these days have a screen that's 5in or bigger, but we prefer the portability of the 4.7in screen size and find it to be a good balance between being usable, enjoyable for gaming and videos, and a comfortable fit in the hand, pocket or bag.. The screen itself is Samsung's HD Super AMOLED display, which the company describes as 2.5D due to its slight curve at the edges. Super AMOLED screen tech is our favourite of all phone displays thanks to its vibrant, slightly oversaturated colours and excellent contrast. This screen hasn't changed since last year's models and is still HD at 1280x720 pixels, but due to the smaller screen size this still offers a pixel density of 312ppi. It'll be sharp enough for most users, but it's worth noting that there are phones with lower price tags that offer better screens, including the upcoming Moto G5 with its Full HD (1920x1080 pixels) screen.. Beneath that screen is the tech that powers the A3, including its 1.6GHz Exynos 7870 Octa-core processor. That's an improvement over the 1.5GHz Exynos 7578 quad-core processor in last year's model and is paired with 2GB RAM over 1.5GB too.. We found the phone to be responsive and speedy even when opening apps including the camera, but we know from experience with previous A series phones from Samsung and other phones with mid-range processors that it'll likely slow down a bit once you start eating through storage.. We put the A3 through its paces in our benchmark tests to find out how it compares with rivals. We found that it managed a score of 3297 in the multi-core Geekbench 4 performance test, which is similar to scores achieved by the likes of the Honor 6X. It's much, much lower (and therefore slower and less powerful) than flagship rivals but that's to be expected.. In the GFX graphic tests, the A3 scored similarly to its 2016 predecessor, with 19fps for the T-Rex onscreen test and 10fps for the Manhattan test. That's again very similar to the Honor 6X.. There's 16GB of internal storage in the A3, but there is now also the capacity to add up to 256GB thanks to the microSD card slot, which is an improvement over last year's 128GB max. You'll likely never need quite that much, but most users will want to add a microSD card of some size to the phone as you're left with a lot less space once all of the preinstalled apps are taken into account.. When it comes to connectivity, the A3 now charges via USB-C like Samsung's Note 7. USB-C will soon be the norm for all phones rather than the current MicroUSB, but it does mean there's a slightly annoying transition period to deal with first as you'll need to get used to the new cable and potentially new adapters for your accessories too.. The battery has increased in capacity slightly over its predecessor, now 2,350mAh rather than 2,300mAh. It's still non-removable, but it does offer fast charging. We found that the battery would last more than a day on one charge.. The A3 also has NFC, 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2 and GPS.. The Samsung Galaxy A3's rear camera is still the 13Mp f/1.9 snapper with an LED flash that we got with last year's model. There's autofocus but still no optical image stabilisation, which means you'll need to keep a steady hand to capture the best shots.. We weren't blown away by the camera (take a look at some test shots above) and we found that we sometimes had to take two or three pictures to get a crisp shot, but overall they're reasonably sharp and offer realistic colours. There are various shooting modes to choose from too, including Pro, Panorama, Continuous Shot, HDR, Night and more, as well as plenty of Instagram-like filters.. The major camera improvement goes to the front-facing camera, though, which is now 8Mp rather than 5Mp.. When it comes to video, the A3 is capable of capturing 1080p video at 30fps.. The A3 now offers Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, with Samsung’s TouchWiz UI overlaid but nothing particularly notable and there are some features missing that you’ll find on Samsung’s flagship models like Multi-Window View, Pop-Up Window modes and more.. Taking a quick look at how the A3 compares to its bigger siblings now, you’ll find that there are some quite big differences although they do come at £100 a time. Take a look at the table below for more details..

Overall, the A3's improvements for 2017 are pretty significant and make this nice-size, reasonably priced phone even more appealing for those who like the idea of the Galaxy S7 but can't quite stretch their budget that far. Its waterproofing and fingerprint sensor are both convenient and practical, and the good-looking design makes it easy to forget that this phone has a price tag that's half that of many flagship phones.. That said, there are alternatives if you're willing to look to other brands, and you might be surprised to find that you'll get more for your money. We'd recommend checking out the Moto G5 and Nokia's new offerings before you buy the Samsung Galaxy A3 to see whether they appeal to your wallet a bit more..

Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) review: the mid-range phone that thinks it's a flagship. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) review: triple-A. Samsung Galaxy S7 review: back to the good ol' times. Aside from a few downsides, the Galaxy A3 (2016) managed to put in such a convincing performance last year. it easily became a signature mid-range device. Samsung is hoping to repeat the experience, and so is looking again to release a new version of its Galaxy A3. Will the Korean manufacturer be able to impress the public enough so they'll overlook the recent scandals that have beleaguered the company? Here are our first impressions.. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) release date and price. It didn't come as a huge surprise to see Samsung introduce its. new A3 and A5 devices at CES in Las Vegas. These two mid-range staples are very popular within Samsung's fanbase, so to keep the people happy the company had to provide a new version of the peoples' favorite.. For the moment there hasn't been any word on when we should expect to see the Galaxy A3 (2017) released, but given how universally popular the device has been we shouldn't be kept waiting too long. We'll keep an eye on the situation and keep you posted.. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) design and build quality. As always the mini-jack is present, but now includes a USB Type-C. The slot for the SIM card is now at the top end of the device. Easy to handle and a pleasure to use. In terms of design, the Galaxy A3 (and its close associate, the. A5) is without doubt an important member of the Samsung family.. On paper, this version of the. A3 (2017) looks almost identical to its predecessor: its dimensions (135.4 x 66.2 x 7.9 mm) are quite similar and its weight (135 grams) is only 3 grams more than the 2016 edition.. classic Samsung design (Home button at the bottom, logo on top below the speaker) are still present, and. the resemblance to the Galaxy S7 -. despite the difference in size - is striking, there are still a few changes to. Since the fiery demise of the Galaxy Note 7 , Samsung has been out to win back its customers, so Samsung needs to be innovative and offer something different.. The loudspeaker that was located on the bottom edge of the phone has now moved to. is really convenient as you can now avoids covering. hands), and can now be charged with a new USB Type-C interface.. the SIM card location can also now accommodate a. microSD card, which is now located on the top end of the device.. On the back, the lens of the camera sits discreetly within the casing.. The great novelty that will delight all the fans out there is the introduction. There is nothing at all wrong with the finish on the device. While we're not at a flagship level here, like what we would expect to see. on the Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge , you get a really strong impression that when you are holding. This is thanks to the glass back and rounded edges, so again taking a few more of. Equally interesting: thanks to its IP68 certification the smartphone is now waterproof, just like the S7.. and waterproofing on a dual-SIM device that has been developed for the mid-range smartphone market. a big step on the part of Samsung.. is relatively small, at least when compared to most other smartphones that are currently available, and I have to admit it is great to. I readily admit that it is a little on the slippery side, but not to the point where you loose your grip. (unless you're really clumsy), and you can easily use it with only one hand.. The definition and the pixel density are the same as on the previous model.. The Home button also acts as a fingerprint scanner. Overall, the screen has the same technical configuration as its predecessor.. As usual, we find a 4.71-inch (11.95 cm) wide Super AMOLED HD (1,280 x 720 pixels) screen and a. version of Gorilla Glass is also the same: GG4.. What may be surprising, however, is the inclusion. Here the device will continually display. information (clock, calendar or picture) and you can also choose to show your. One small insignificant detail: by default the screen goes out in the middle (similar to what you find with old televisions), which has. Certainly, this does necessarily enhance your overall experience, but it's always nice to watch.. Best note taking apps for Android. The Galaxy A3 runs with Android 6.0.1 and includes Samsung's TouchWiz interface, so it functions quite similarly to to the S7 Edge with Nougat. I must admit I have never been a very big fan of Samsung, especially since the older versions (especially the Galaxy S5 ) were weighed down with a poor software interface. Since introducing the Galaxy S6 , Samsung has clearly gone out of their way to improve things and the interface is now nice and functional.. The same can be said for the A3, but it will be necessary for us to carry out a complete test to see how the different functionalities work in action. A good example here will be the blue light filter. One small funny detail: Small funny detail: when you scroll through the notifications bar it occupies three-quarters. of the screen, and you can't swipe to access the other shortcuts. Naturally, there is still a lot of bloatware. These include Microsoft apps (Excel, OneNote, PowerPoint, OneDrive, Skype and Word), Google apps, Samsung apps and Facebook , which cannot be uninstalled.. we find the Exynos 7870 processor built on a 14 nm process.. This is a mid-range chip, as you can imagine: the eight Cortex-A53 cores are clocked at a frequency of 1.6 GHz. support all of this, the Mali-T830 MP2 GPU. and paired with a relatively conservative 2 GB of RAM.. This should be more than enough for a standard user who doesn't spend too much time on their phone, i.e. the sort of person Samsung is targeting in. In reality, this is a little disappointing since the device offers only 9.8 GB of available internal memory and 481 MB of RAM (without installing any apps!). Small disappointment concerns the SAR: at the top we find 0.349 W / kg, which is okay, but in the body it's relatively high. with 1.38 W / kg (European data).. The camera is similar to that on the Galaxy S7. Again, just like its predecessor, it's a 13 MP sensor behind a. There has been something in the way of a change, as the selfie camera has gone up from 5 MP to 8 MP resolution. That said, they've kept the f / 1.9 lens.. The camera app is more or less identical to that on Galaxy S7, but with fewer. filters, in particular), but many staples for the Samsung. brand have made their way in.. It will take a more complete test of the camera to see what it's made of, so we'll do our best to fill in that information gap.. A 2350 mAh battery is now included. On paper, we noticed that there's only a small increase in battery capacity: we go from 2,300 to 2,350 mAh.. We haven't had the opportunity to test the smartphone over an extended period of time,. so we're not yet sure how well it will support regular use, but with a bigger capacity and (hopefully!) a. good optimization, it should be even better than its predecessor (and that was really. Charging is via USB Type-C cable. Don't immediately assume that this will charge the device with lightening speed, as this will depend on which USB version Samsung decides to include and this information has yet to be communicated by the company.. We'll focus more on how well the battery performs. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) technical specifications. 135.4 x 66.2 x 7.9 mm. 1280 x 720 pixels (312 ppi). Samsung wants to (re)conquer the hearts of users and still win the favor of the masses.. By offering a waterproof smartphone with fingerprint sensor, a very elegant design and a SIM + microSD for a competitive price, it's definitely going. to attract a lot of positive attention.. Their intention is clear: it wants to offer the mid-range user a well-rounded a device. as possible, though not quite reaching. The software interface seems to have. In our full test, we will look at all these points in more detail and will focus on whether the autonomy is as good as on its predecessor.. Are you a fan of the Galaxy A series? Are you planning on upgrading to the new Galaxy A3 (2017) when it is released? Let us know in the comments below.. This is the worst Samsung phone I have ever owned screen freezes for no reason and when you press to go on standby and the press again to come off standby I just get a keyboard screen and have to reset the phone and the fingerprint is rubbish can't wait to get rid of it. I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 mini purchased from Kogan.com that randomly restarts itself every now and again & doesn't support otg so Im thinking of upgrading to the Samsung Galaxy A3 2017. I like the size and the specifications, even for a mid-range phone seem pretty good.. I want something smaller than 5". And this seems to be the best phone I can find under 5". I am assuming it will be released on Verizon. If so, I hope to get this phone unless something else comes along in the mean time. The main features I would miss on this phone are a removable battery and quick charge.. by the on paper specification it's looking good but the price of this smartphone is not justifying. Might as well add review of the phone while playing High-end games like NBA 2K.. Thank You ; This Is Good Review !!. Release date? if this is available on Verizon I will likely buy it..

Samsung was a prime culprit in the growth of smartphone screen sizes, but back in 2014 it tried something different with the Galaxy Alpha - it offered a high-end phone in a small scale body. We feel that the Galaxy A3 is the Alpha's spiritual successor and we're here to look at the third iteration.. The Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) is the baby of the lineup in terms of screen size - just 4.7" big. It is a Super AMOLED unit, mind you, and one with an Always On Display, something the similarly-sized iPhone 7 screen does not offer.. Another first for the A-series is the top-level waterproofing - the IP68 rating is as high as flagships get (and higher than the iPhone's). Samsung also brought its mobile payment solution, Samsung Pay, backed by a fingerprint reader.. The Galaxy Alpha was a premium device that was positioned to target the iPhone directly while the Galaxy A3 (2017) fights the Apple flagship from an affordable price point (less than half the cost of an iPhone 7!). At a glance, it seems the camera will be critical - the lack of OIS and 2160p video capture hurt A3's premium standing. Processing power is the other thing we need to have a closer look at..

The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge might be Samsung’s current – andÂ. soon to be replaced – flagships, but you don’t have to buy them to experience the flagship Galaxy experience.Â. The Galaxy A 2017 series offer a few flagship features from the Galaxy S7 at a much more affordable price point. The question is, should you buy the Galaxy A3 or Galaxy A5?. This yearâs handsets donât overhaul a lot from previous years, with Samsung opting to borrow specific Galaxy S features to improve the overall experience. The first of these is the design, with all three Galaxy A models borrowing the curved 3D glass rear and minimal bezel from last yearâs flagships. In the hand, these definitely feel a lot like the Galaxy S range and the curved rear makes them very ergonomically friendly.. Another change is the camera bump, which has been shaved from 1.3mm in 2015 to 0.7mm last year and now, it sits flush with the rear of the handset. All three models also borrow the Galaxy DNA, with IP68 certification for waterproofing , an always-on display, microSD card expansion and a long lasting battery. In particular, IP68 certification is fantastic for the price point and the always-on display (coupled with general design) does make you feel like you might be using the Galaxy S7.. the similarities, but the differences are also crucial, with varying specs across the Galaxy A3 and A5 we have here, as well as the Galaxy A7 (which isnât coming to the UK).. Up front, the Galaxy A3 2017 sports a 4.7-inch 720p display, the A5 has a 5.2-inch Full HD display and the Galaxy A7 has a larger 5.7-inch Full HD 1080p screen. Super AMOLED displays and offer the vibrant colors, rich saturation and deep blacks we’ve come to expect from Samsung’s displays.. Samsung is calling an advanced camera, with the A3 offering a 13MP rear and 8MP front camera, while the A5 and A7 have a 16MP camera on the front and back. come with f/1.9 aperture for better low light photos and the Galaxy A5 and A7 also have Phase Detection Autofocus for lightning fast focus times.. One particularly useful feature is a floating shutter, which allows you to drag the camera shutter button anywhere on the screen, in a bid to solve the problem of cramping your hand when reaching down to take a selfie. The camera also has a simple Swipe UI so you can swipe up or down to flip between the cameras left to change modes and right to change effects. It’s simple enough but rather effective and there’s little to no lag when swiping around the interface.. The Galaxy A3 is powered by Samsungâs quad-core Exynos 7870 processor with 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, while the A5 and A7 feature a slightly better Exynos 7880 CPU, 32GB of storage and 3GB of RAM. come with USB Type-C ports as well as a fingerprint sensor built into the home button beneath the screen.. The A3 is powered by a 2,350mAh battery, the A5 has a much beefier 3,000mAh battery and the A7 is powered by a 3,600mAh battery. Interestingly, Samsung chose to move the speaker to the upper corner of the handset rather than the bottom which should prevent the issue of the speaker being covered when you’re watching a video in landscape.. Available in four colors â Black Sky, Gold Sand, Blue Mist and Peach Cloud â these handsets offer a touch of the flagship Galaxy S experience at a more affordable price point. At a price point of Â£279 for the A3 and Â£369 for the A5 in the UK, theyâll both have stiff competition but offer a glimpse of the Galaxy S experience for half the cost or less. The Galaxy A7 doesn’t have a price point in the UK but we’d expect it to cost the equivalent of Â£450-Â£500.. What do you think of the Galaxy A 2017 series? Do you plan to buy any of them?

The Galaxy A3 (2017) is powered by the in-house 64-bit Samsung Exynos 7 Octa 7870. with 2 GB of RAM and an ARM Mali-T830 MP2. Out of the box only 9.8 GB of its 16 GB storage space is available, and Samsung does not offer additional tiers. However, a MicroSD-card expansion of up to 256 GB is supported and apps can be saved to SD storage. While some apps do not support this we've had no issues with the likes of 3DMark, Asphalt 8: Airborne , or Dead Trigger 2 , which when combined took up more than 2 GB of storage. Unfortunately, the MicroSD card slot cannot be used as a secondary SIM-card slot.. The reversible USB Type-C port only supports USB 2.0 speeds, but it does have OTG capabilities. Since Samsung had to cut corners here and there â this is after all a mid-range device â the Galaxy A3 doesnât support MHL or Qi wireless charging, but it does have Wi-Fi Direct capabilities allowing wireless display sync.. Bottom: USB 2.0 Type-C connector, audio jack. With Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow as OS, the Galaxy A3 (2017) features Samsungâs custom user interface called âGrace UXâ. An update to Android 7.0 Nougat has already been announced but had not yet been released at the time of writing (late March 2017).. The Grace UX user interface alters Androidâs default GUI. In addition to a news ticker located left of the home screen, a so-called âBackground and Themesâ setting allows customization thereof. Like its predecessor, the A3 (2017) supports âSmart Stayâ, a feature that relies on the front-facing camera and which leaves the display powered on as long as the user is looking at the screen regardless of configured display timeouts.. Fortunately, the amount of pre-loaded bloatware is fairly low, and the preinstalled apps are limited to Googleâs default software suite, some Microsoft apps such as OneDrive, Excel, or Skype, and Samsungâs own apps including S Health and S Voice. A Samsung app we liked is "Secure Folder",. which allows moving apps and files into a securely locked environment thus preventing unauthorized access.. The Galaxy A3 (2017) supports quad-band GMS and UMTS and a total of eight frequency bands for LTE Cat. A nano-SIM is required, and with ample carrier support the device is capable of speeds of up to 150 Mbit/s (download) and 50 Mbit/s (upload), respectively.. Wi-Fi capabilities include 802.11 a, b, g, and ac in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency ranges. It did very well during our tests and managed to send up to 225 Mbit/s and receive up to 305 Mbit/s. This means it beats its HTC, Huawei and Wiko competitors but it is bested slightly by the. Short distance communication via Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC is also supported..

Location services include support for GPS and GLONASS, and the Galaxy A3 (2017) does very well. Indoors it was capable of determining its correct location within 6 meters (roughly 20 feet); outdoors it managed an accuracy of 5 meters (16 feet). Pitched against the professional Garmin Edge 500 GPS on our 12 km-long bicycle test track the Galaxy A3 (2017) held its ground fairly well. Even though it lacked the Garminâs precision the accumulated difference in travel distance was only 300 meters (985 feet). This translates to more than adequate and sufficient precision for everyday use.. Samsungâs custom Grace UX interface of the phone app offers the same features as Googleâs stock Android phone app: favorites, a call log, and access to the contacts. The settings include additional features, such as caller management to block specific numbers. It also offers different choices of how one wants to answer the phone, e.g. by pressing the home button or even automatically after a pre-set configurable waiting period.. Call quality was good during our test calls in Vodafoneâs 3G network regardless of whether we used the built-in microphone or the included headset. Using the hands-free speakerphone, voice transmission was rather quiet but not yet disruptively so. Background noise was cancelled very efficiently, and we did not experience any dropped calls during our tests.. Front camera sample (click for original). Front camera sample (click for original). Just like its predecessor, the Galaxy A3âs main camera captures 13 megapixels (4128x3096), features an aperture of f/1.9, and it has an LED flash. The optional 16:9 aspect ratio reduces the resolution to 9.6 megapixels (4128x2322). Compared to the Galaxy A3 (2016) the front-facing camera was bumped from 5 to 8 megapixels. The rear camera now also sits flush with the back cover and does not protrude from it anymore, which prevents wobbling when placed on its back side.. The main camera did well in our tests. Photos taken in good lighting conditions were ever so slightly oversaturated but overall very well balanced in terms of dynamic range, sharpness, and details. Low-light images did show a noticeable amount of noise and lack of sharpness due to the lack of optical image stabilization but were overall still very usable. However, low-light conditions were a problem for the autofocus, and its troubles with focusing were somewhat alleviated by the activation of the LED flash.. In addition to Auto mode the camera menu also supports a Professional mode, which allows manual adjustments of ISO sensitivity, white balance, and shutter speed. It also supports preconfigured picture modes, such as panorama or HDR photography and â as a special feature â a food mode for showcasing one's food shots. The included predefined filters are self-explanatory and carry names such as Saturation, Cream, Woods, Grayscale, or Nostalgia. Videos are recorded at 30 frames per second with a resolution of up to 1920x1080, and video quality is very decent.. The 8-megapixel f/1.9 aperture front-facing camera features presets such as Selfie or Group-Selfie and is clearly optimized for self-portrayal, which works quite well under decent lighting conditions. Like the main camera, the front-facing camera captures video in Full HD at 30 frames per second.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. To determine the color accuracy of the Galaxy A3âs main camera we've used a photo of the X-Rite ColorChecker Passport taken under predefined lighting conditions, and we compared it to the actual reference colors. The photo was not post-processed at all, meaning there was no manual post-photography adjustment of white balance or other aspects.. The result is rather colorful â compared to the reference colors the Galaxy A3âs colors and grayscales tend to be a bit oversaturated and too bright.. Similarly, a photo of our reference card taken under predefined lighting conditions was used to determine the Galaxy A3âs main cameraâs sharpness and clarity. The result is somewhat mixed: the bottom left corner is noticeably blurry; the center of the image is very sharp and clear.. Photographed ColorChecker reference: The lower half of each square contains the original color. Included with the Galaxy A3 (2017) are a modular charger (5V, 1.55A), a USB Type-C cable, a headset, a SIM-card removal tool, a quick-start guide, and a warranty card. In addition, accessories such as a flip cover , a clear cover , and a screen protector. The Galaxy A3 (2017) comes with a 24-month warranty on the phone itself, a 12-month warranty on wear and tear parts such as the charger, the headset, or the USB cable, and a 6-month warranty on the battery.. Thanks to its curved glass edges the Galaxy A3 (2017)âs touchscreen is not only very gentle to the touch but is also very accurate. Flipping through menus or rotating the screen is blazingly fast and the phone didnât disappoint even with multiple apps open simultaneously. Occasionally, the UI did stutter, for example when switching between complex applications or during an update process running in the background. The stutter was never really disruptive, though.. The preinstalled Samsung touch keyboard offers a very good compromise between number of keys and the limited space inherent to small displays. By default, a row of numbers is displayed and the keyboard supports gestures and Googleâs voice commands, makes suggestions, uses autocorrect, and it is adjustable in height. In landscape mode it uses roughly half of the available screen estate; in portrait mode it uses a bit more than a third.. The smartphoneâs physical buttons â a volume rocker, a power button, and the home button â all have very precise actuation points and no noticeable play. The home button includes a solid and reliable fingerprint-reader. Both the back and menu button are soft-touch buttons that illuminate for a short time when activated.. The Galaxy A3 (2017)âs Super AMOLED display measures 4.7-inches and features a 1280x720 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 312 ppi. While this equals its predecessor, the display of this year's model is noticeably brighter.. An average evenly distributed (94%) brightness of 576 nits with activated ambient light sensor is very impressive. It reaches even higher levels of up to 693 nits during the APL 50 tests (Average Picture Level) in which bright and dark segments are evenly distributed over the entire screen. Disabling the ambient light sensor caps the maximum brightness at a reasonable 345 nits.. Since AMOLED displays allow black levels of zero the contrast ratio is - in theory - infinite. Thus, colors pop and are very well saturated, and all things considered we found no issues with the Galaxy A3âs display. However, PWM-flickering might be noticeable to some users at brightness levels of 92% or less.. 604 cd/m² 572 cd/m² 568 cd/m² 574 cd/m² 574 cd/m² 568 cd/m² 576 cd/m² 576 cd/m² 576 cd/m². 94 % Center on Battery: 574. cd/m²) ΔE Color 2.4 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 1.9 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.09.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 250 Hz. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 250. Hz is relatively low, so sensitive users will likely notice flickering and experience eyestrain at the stated brightness setting and below.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9024 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured..

In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.9 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. % of all devices are better. This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Several color presets can be chosen from in the phoneâs settings. With its grayscale accuracy of DeltaE 1.9 and its color accuracy of DeltaE 2.4 "Simple" is. As such, it is well within the optimum of DeltaE < 3, and at the very top of its range. The only smartphone with an even more accurate out-of-the-box color presentation is its own predecessor, the Galaxy A3 (2016).. The two color modes called âAMOLED Photoâ and âAMOLED Videoâ are significantly less accurate, with a color accuracy of DeltaE 4.7 and 4.1, respectively. This might be due to the fact that while we measured sRGB accuracy the âAMOLED Photoâ mode uses AdobeRGB instead. Notwithstanding that, color temperature for both profiles and Gamma for all three profiles are near perfect. By default, the phoneâs self-adjustable auto mode is enabled..

Thanks to the combination of ultra-bright display and AMOLED panel the Galaxy A3 (2017) is well-equipped to be used outdoors. Unlike smartphones with IPS panels even direct sunlight doesnât render it useless, and display content is still recognizable.. Another benefit of the AMOLED panel is its superb viewing angles. Even when viewed from extreme angles, display brightness remains unchanged and only color temperature drops slightly, shifting the display slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum..

The Galaxy A3âs in-house octa-core Samsung Exynos 7 Octa 7870 SOC is supported by the. ARM Mali-T830 MP2 GPU and has access to 2 GB of RAM. While this mix doesnât make for a top performer it isnât half bad and the phone offers a decent overall performance. Itâs certainly fast enough for everyday apps and a game or two. In synthetic benchmarks, our review unit beat its own Exynos 7578-equipped predecessor, the Galaxy A3 (2016) , albeit the difference between the two is negligible. The HTC One A9s , the. Huawei Nova , and the Wiko U Feel Prime were about as fast as the Galaxy A3 (2017) and all four had to bow to the significantly better-performing BQ Aquaris X5 Plus.

Accessing our reference SD card, a Toshiba Exceria Pro M401 with read and write speeds of up to 95 MB/s and 80 MB/s, respectively, paints a completely different picture though. While none of the contestants were able to max out the card, the BQ Aquaris X5 Plus , the Huawei Nova , and the Galaxy A3 (2017) at least came close..

Given its fairly powerful mid-range ARM Mali-T830 MP2. GPU, the Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) should perform very well in most current Android games. Occasionally it might be necessary to reduce details in order to improve performance and avoid stuttering. The rather demanding Dead Trigger 2 performed very well with 52 frames per second at its highest detail level. Asphalt 8: Airborne only managed to render 23 frames per second with its details maxed out, therefore stuttering slightly. Both the touchscreen and its acceleration sensors were very accurate and fast.. After a full hour of stress testing the Galaxy A3 (2017) remained at acceptable temperature levels. We found it to reach a maximum temperature of 32 Â°C (90 Â°F) under load and a very low 27.7 Â°C (82 Â°F) when idle. As expected, the device does not throttle under load and frame rates remained stable even after 30 reruns of the GFXBenchâs T-Rex benchmark.. 30.4 °C 31.3 °C 30.3 °C. 31.7 °C 31.7 °C 31.8 °C. 31.6 °C 31.8 °C 31.2 °C.

With each reiteration of the Galaxy A3, the speaker roams the device rather freely and ends up someplace else. Galaxy A3 featured a rear-mounted speaker, last yearâs Galaxy A3 (2016). had it placed at the bottom next to the Micro USB port. This year, Samsung went with the left-hand side next to the power button. As with last yearâs model this means the sound is not muffled when the phone is placed flat on a table.. Being a mono speaker, we didnât expect it to be much good, yet it surprised us with its decent performance. Reaching a volume of almost 83 dB(A) it was acceptably loud and didn't produce any noticeable distortion even at maximum volume. If you listen very closely thereâs even a hint of bass. The included headphones are even better.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 36.6 25 25.4 31.5 31 25.3 31.7 40 32.9 31.1 50 33.6 27.1 63 31.6 31.5 80 28.4 29.3 100 27 29.8 125 20.8 32.6 160 22 40.8 200 21.3 44.7 250 20.8 50 315 21.2 54.4 400 19.4 61.2 500 19.5 64.6 630 17.7 69.3 800 17.9 72.7 1000 17.8 75.5 1250 17.3 72.8 1600 17.4 72.4 2000 16.7 71 2500 17.2 72.1 3150 18.2 72.8 4000 17.9 69.1 5000 17.6 63.7 6300 17.7 60.5 8000 17.8 56.7 10000 17.9 59.7 12500 18.1 50 16000 18.2 45.6 SPL 30 82.6 N 1.3 51.2 median 17.9 Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 median 61.2 Delta 1.3 12 35.9 34.4 35.7 35.9 31.5 32.8 32.4 31.5 29.9 28.9 27.5 29.9 28.4 30.5 27.5 28.4 33.4 37 35.4 33.4 32.1 33.6 29.7 32.1 30.2 29.1 29.2 30.2 24.6 25.7 25.3 24.6 24.8 22.8 24.1 24.8 26.7 23.1 23 26.7 41.1 22.6 23.1 41.1 48.6 26.5 18.5 48.6 54.2 31.9 20.5 54.2 57 35.1 18.7 57 65 40.9 18.1 65 69.8 46.3 18.2 69.8 73.4 52 19.1 73.4 70.7 53.2 17 70.7 68.5 53.9 17.3 68.5 69.8 50.2 17.4 69.8 71.1 46.8 17.5 71.1 71.9 50.6 17.3 71.9 75.5 52.8 17.2 75.5 72.1 49.8 17.2 72.1 71.6 50 17.2 71.6 75.9 52.6 17.6 75.9 76.1 52.2 17.7 76.1 69.2 45.7 17.8 69.2 61.3 36.3 18 61.3 58.1 34.6 17.9 58.1 84.4 62.8 29.9 84.4 60.5 15.9 1.3 60.5 median 69.2 Samsung Galaxy A3 2016 median 46.3 median 17.9 median 69.2 10.6 10 1.5 10.6 27.6 28.8 27.6 26.6 26.4 26.6 25.7 26.3 25.7 27.7 25.1 27.7 27.9 24.8 27.9 22.8 25.4 22.8 24.2 23.2 24.2 27.1 23.5 27.1 36.9 30.9 36.9 35.1 20 35.1 41.5 19.9 41.5 46.9 21.7 46.9 53.1 24.2 53.1 55 21.2 55 56.4 21.1 56.4 57.6 17.9 57.6 59.3 20 59.3 62.5 20.4 62.5 67.9 18.1 67.9 68.4 14.8 68.4 70.5 16 70.5 72.9 14.9 72.9 74.8 14.4 74.8 75.2 13.9 75.2 72.2 13.3 72.2 67.9 12.8 67.9 68.8 12.9 68.8 58.3 12.9 58.3 50.6 13.2 50.6 44.9 12.8 44.9 82.6 29.2 82.6 48.7 1.2 48.7 median 58.3 HTC One A9s median 17.9 median 58.3 10.8 3.6 10.8 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Frequency diagram (checkboxes are selectable / deselectable). Compared to last yearâs model, the non-removable lithium-ion batteryâs capacity has been increased moderately by 50 mAh to 2,350 mAh. Power consumption, however, has been lowered drastically, peaking at 2.75 watts during our tests. Not only is this significantly less than last yearâs Galaxy A3 (2016). but it also literally pounds its competitors, that in some cases devour up to twice as much energy. P erfect conditions for a very good battery life..

The Galaxy A3 (2017) does not disappoint. Itâs moderately increased capacity combined with its power efficiency turned this device into a beast. Only after 9 hours of continuous load did it finally run out of power, and it lasted a very good 11 hours in our Wi-Fi test. A Full HD video can be enjoyed for up to 16:28 hours before the phone runs out of juice.

In review: Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017). There is little to no need for an upgrade for those who already own last year's Galaxy A3 (2016). With its similar build quality, this year's model does have a few advantages, though.. First of all the Galaxy A3 (2017) is now IP68 dust- and waterproof. In addition, it features a USB Type-C port, does not have its camera protruding from the back anymore, seems significantly sturdier thanks to the lack of aforementioned silver frame, and it's running a more recent Android 6.0.1 operating system.. Upgrading the processor to the faster. Exynos 7870 did have the expected effect on overall performance. The battery life improvements are more important: due to its incredible power efficiency the Galaxy A3 (2017) is an extremely durable beast. Both cameras have been improved as well, and the latest reiteration fares much better under low-light conditions. The front-facing camera has been updated from 5 to 8 megapixels.. The Galaxy A3 (2017) is a far cry from reinventing the wheel; instead, its iterative improvements have been gentle and effective.. Despite its manageable and quite handy 4.7-inch form factor, the smooth back side may cause quite a stir with some users. The only thing you can really do is try for yourself whether or not the phone feels slippery. We for one did not mind the glassy back cover. Yet there is no way to sugarcoat the phoneâs shortcomings: no MHL, no dual SIM-card support, and no optical image stabilization. Some users might also notice PWM-flickering at brightness levels below 92%. In spite of these limitations, the Galaxy A3 (2017) remains a very solid and respectable mid-range smartphone with little cause for complaint..

SIM Only SIM Samsung Galaxy S7 black Apple iPhone 7 32GB black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge black Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus black Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus rose pink Apple iPhone 7 32GB rose gold Samsung Galaxy S8 black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge gold Samsung Galaxy S8 grey. Desirable brand name in a compact form. Our Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 review sheds light on this branded yet affordable and compact mobile phone.. Priced in the UK from £15.99 per month on a 24 month contract, from £269.99 on pay as you go or from £288.99 as a handset only, there are good savings to be had, compared to the larger Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 .. To make those cost savings, Samsung has given the Galaxy A3 2017 a smaller display, processor, internal memory, battery and camera, yet there is still plenty of Samsung goodness to enjoy.. Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 black deals. Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 blue deals. Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 gold deals. Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 peach deals. The Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 has a compact 4.7” Super AMOLED HD display (720 x 1280 pixels). Samsung’s Super AMOLED displays are extremely desirable due to their brightness and vivid colour production.. The design has been crafted with minimalism and a symmetrical form in mind. The rear of the phone is made from 3D Glass and there is no unsightly camera protrusion. The Galaxy A3 2017 is just about as light as they come at 138g and this phone is 7.9mm thick.. There are four colours to choose from and these include the muted tones of Black, Blue, Gold and Peach, coloured after the natural elements.. Furthermore, the design includes a speedy 1.6GHz octa-core processor with 2GB RAM. The durability of the phone is given a boost with IP68 certification indicating that the phone is protected from spills, splashes and the rain, in most situations.. Setting up some security should be your first task after receiving your new Samsung Galaxy A3 2017. The fingerprint sensor is pretty handy for this and it can also be used to access a private Secure Folder.. You can transfer content and media from your old smartphone onto the Galaxy A3 2017 and there is an internal memory of 16GB, of which 9.7GB is free to the user. A microSD card slot accepts cards with a memory of up to 256GB.. New: Nokia 3 review. You may also wish at this stage to back up your content on Samsung Cloud, where you can enjoy 15GB of free storage.. One of the most attractive features of the Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 is the Always On Display. This preserves both time and power with a clock, calendar and notifications always visible.. The Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 has Google’s Android Marshmallow operating system pre-loaded. It is expected that Samsung will provide an update to Android Nougat soon, but this hasn’t officially been announced, so it isn’t gauranteed.. The Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 offers quality photography and on the left, we have an included a gallery of photos taken by the 13MP camera. After all, pictures speak louder than words.. There are plenty of filters to add a unique touch in post editing and there is a special food mode, for when it’s time to gloat. The camera can record Full HD video at 30 frames per second.. The 8MP selfie camera is perfectly adept at its job and is perfectly capable of accurate colour rendition, even under low light.. The 2,350mAh battery may have a fairly low capacity but don’t let this fool you into thinking that you will be charging the phone every five minutes. Under laboratory testing conditions, the battery outlasted most current flagship phones.. To put this into numbers, you can expect to enjoy up to 41 hours of audio playback or up to 17 hours of internet browsing or video playback. You can extend the audio playback times further by turning off the Always On Display, giving you up to 55 hours of playback. Charging is also made easier with the new symmetrical, and hence reversible, USB Type-C port and charging cable.. Next: WileyFox Swift 2 Plus review. 500 MB data.

Home / News / Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) review: Finally the ‘A class’ compact phone we wanted. Design Display Camera Software Performance Audio Quality Battery Life Wrap Up Pros Cons Compact, flagship-like design Average rear camera Flagship-grade software features Performance could be better Fingerprint sensor No Android Nougat out of the box IP68 water resistance Samsung Pay support Good selfie camera Impressive battery life. After reviewing the Galaxy A5 (2017) , I turned to the Galaxy A3 (2017) , the smallest of the new A series. The A3 has always been the device lacking in specs ever since the Galaxy A lineup was launched. Last year’s A3 had no Samsung Pay support nor a fingerprint sensor, making it a tough sell compared to its bigger siblings.. Samsung has changed things a bit this year, though. The A3 (2017) is water resistant like the A5 and A7 and has support for Samsung Pay as well. It does, however, miss out on an important feature: The 16-megapixel front camera on the A5 and A7 has been replaced by an 8 MP camera on the A3, which could take it out of the running for selfie lovers.. But what is the overall experience like? Has Samsung outdone itself this year, or is the new A3 once again a hard to recommend device? Let’s dive into the review and find out.. Right off the bat, this phone comes off as a well engineered and beautiful machine. It has the same glass and metal build as the A5 and A7. In the bottom end of the mid-range market, I can say the A3 (2017) is one of the best in terms of design, with very little competition.. Now, let’s go into the details. The Galaxy A3 (2017) has the same thermoformed double-edged back as the A5 and A7, and 2.5D glass at the front. Both of these elements make the phone very comfortable to hold. Despite the glass at the front and back, I never thought the phone would drop out of my hands. Of course, this is mainly because of the compact size (the phone has a 4.7-inch display). For many, the size will come off as perfect.. The unit we reviewed is the pink version; it’s a pastel kind of pink that Samsung calls Peach Cloud, one that I think will do very well with the ladies. The front of the device looks excellent with the slab of Gorilla Glass 4 surrounded by the pink frame.. The A3 (2017) comes with the same button placement as any other phone we have seen from Samsung. The home button on the front features a fingerprint sensor; the big change here is the placement of the speaker, which is now above the power button on the right of the device. The left side has the volume rockers and SIM tray, while the top has a microSD slot and the secondary mic. The bottom of the phone holds the USB Type-C port, the 3.5 mm audio jack and the primary microphone.. The new A3 has IP68 certification for water and dust resistance, the same as the A5 and A7. In its price range, the A3 comes off as unique thanks to the added protection against water and dust, something you will not find on any of the competing smartphones.. The Galaxy A3 (2017) has a 4.7-inch Super AMOLED HD (1280×720) display with a pixel density of approximately 312 ppi. The display has a Diamond PenTile pixel arrangement, but with the small screen, the resolution turns out to be sharp. Viewing angles are how you expect them to be, which is to say they are never a problem. The same goes for sunlight legibility. At a maximum of 547 nits, the screen isn’t as bright as the A5 or A7’s, yet it does a good job of. keeping things readable out in the sun.. The screen also goes very dim to a minimum of 1.8 nits, which means there isn’t a lot of eyestrain when you’re using the phone in bed at night. As for the colors, they pop as much as we would expect them to on an AMOLED display, and contrast is infinite so you also get very deep blacks. The only fly in the ointment here is that the display is once again on the cooler side of the spectrum, making it look rather blue. You can fix this by changing the display mode to basic, although that also takes away some of the vividness of the display.. The camera is one of the few things on this phone that could do with a lot of improvement. The rear camera is a 13-megapixel unit with f/1.9 aperture and no optical image stabilization. The UI is the same as that on the A5 and A7; you can start the camera up with a double-press of the home button (a feature that you can disable if you wish, from the camera settings), and use the app with gestures. Swiping up and down switches between the front and rear cameras, swiping to the right brings up modes, and swiping to the left gives you filter options.. Like with other A series devices (and pretty much any non-flagship Samsung phone), the camera can crank out decent detail in the daytime, but image quality becomes a mess when there isn’t enough light. In natural light the photos have good dynamic range, even though the colors miss out slightly on accuracy. Also, zooming in 100 percent on an image reveals that the lines become a bit blurry, but the detail in good lighting is commendable when the images are viewed normally.. There is ample detail, low noise, and good color accuracy in good lighting, but not so much in low light conditions. The camera can shoot 1080p videos at 30fps, and the lack of OIS means you have to keep your hands steady to take shake-free videos.. Here are a few samples from the rear camera, including a couple of 100 percent crops.. Let’s talk about the selfie camera. Now, while the lower resolution compared to the A5 and A7 might put a few people off, the actual performance of the 8-megapixel front camera is not as bad as you think it would be. It has the habit of blurring out the image, but it does otherwise take decent pictures. The images aren’t very sharp, but there is plenty of detail with good color accuracy and not a lot of noise. In fact, the detail captured by the A3’s front camera is pretty much the same as the 16 MP front cameras on the A5 and A7, so we can give it high marks for the overall performance.. By the way, that new floating camera button on the Galaxy A series? That works great and is very useful, as it removes the need to reach for the actual shutter button. Yes, volume keys are a good alternative to take photos, but those. can sometimes be hard to reach depending on how you’re taking selfies, so the floating button is a handy feature.. The Galaxy A3 (2017) runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box, with the new user interface that debuted with the Galaxy Note 7. There are quite a few features here that we haven’t seen on previous Samsung devices, and even though it isn’t Nougat, some features that were introduced on the S7 and S7 edge with Nougat are available here. As I said in the A5 review, it’s a shame that there is no Nougat out of the box, but Samsung will hopefully release the update in the near future.. There are a few things that are new or different here compared to what everyone is used to on Samsung devices, so let’s take a look at everything point by point.. With the Flipboard briefing panel on the left of the homescreen and support for third-party themes and icons, the A3 (2017) is a complete package. It even has a 3D Touch-like function, which allows you to long press on an icon on the home screen and disable that app or view the app’s info.. The most used toggles are revealed by a swipe down from the notification shade, and another swipe of the notifications menu reveals the entire list of toggles. As always, you can rearrange the toggles to your liking. One issue here is that the brightness slider is now hidden in the extended toggles screen, with no option to access it when you’re viewing your notifications. Nougat should fix this, as the S7 and S7 edge allow re-positioning of the brightness slider.. Another feature shared with Nougat is grouping of notifications. For example, if you have multiple unread emails in the Gmail app, the notification shade will show you a single grouped notification by default. Press the arrow on the right side or the notification itself, and all the notifications will expand, allowing you to further expand or collapse every email. Sadly, that tap on the grouped notification is necessary for expanding it – the grouped notification cannot be expanded without a swipe, which is a shame.. The app drawer is the same as before, with the added ability to search through apps. If an app isn’t found, the phone will offer the option for searching for it in the Play Store or the Galaxy Apps store. Apps aren’t sorted alphabetically by default, but you can change that from the app drawer menu. Once set to alphabetical order, apps will always be sorted that way.. This is a feature that arrived on the Galaxy S7 with Nougat, and it is available on the A3 (2017) as well. Blue light filter reduces the amount of blue light that emanates from the display; blue light is what keeps the brain active (that is why people wake up when the sun, a big source of blue light, rises in the morning) and therefore makes it difficult to fall asleep at night. Blue light is also generally harsher on the eyes than red or green, so the blue light filter is a very important feature that no longer needs a third-party app. The filter can be set to turn on and off at specified times, and its intensity can also be adjusted as needed.. Always On Display is arriving on the Galaxy A lineup with the 2017 models. There are three main views you can choose from: clock, calendar, and image, with some customization available. AOD also has support for third-party apps from the get-go, and double-pressing a notification will launch the app or expand its notifications (the latter happens in the case of third-party apps, while system apps can be directly launched with a double-press).. Luckily, AOD doesn’t consume much battery (1 percent in one and a half to two hours). This is mainly because it shuts off when the phone is in your pocket, and also because the phone has a sufficient battery capacity. for its specs (to compare, the Galaxy S7, with more demanding specs, has the same battery capacity). The AOD screen is also dimmed based on the surrounding light. Always On Display can be set to turn on and off at specified times, just like the blue light filter feature.. Just like last year, you can secure your phone with a fingerprint. It is the same fingerprint sensor that is present on the Galaxy S7, meaning it is just as fast. It also lets you sign-in to websites using your fingerprint, although this only works in Samsung’s own browser app and some of the inbuilt apps. Purchases made in the Galaxy Apps store can also be authorised using your fingerprint; this is done through your Samsung account.. like on the Galaxy J7 Prime , the fingerprint sensor on the new A series only needs to be touched to unlock the phone when the screen is completely off instead of pressing the home button. This is something Samsung is unwilling to. offer on its flagship line for some reason , but we are glad to see it is making its way to all of the company’s new mid-range and budget phones.. Secure Folder is powered by Samsung’s own KNOX security platform. It lets you create a separate space on your phone for your important/private photos, apps and documents. When you take a picture in Secure Folder, or make a document, it can only be accessed inside Secure Folder and will not be visible when you’re using your phone normally, keeping things away from prying eyes. Secure Folder was introduced on the Galaxy Note 7, and. is set to arrive on the Galaxy S7 soon .. The Galaxy A3 (2017) is powered by the Exynos 7870 chipset, built on a 14 nm process and featuring a clock speed of 1.6 GHz, making it focused purely on efficiency rather than performance. There’s 2GB of RAM and a Mali-T380 MP2 GPU accompanying the processor, and for most intents and purposes, the A3 does a fine job at keeping up with regular usage. It’s only when playing high-end games or installing/updating apps that the A3 shows its. The A5 and A7 aren’t much better off either in demanding use cases, and I hope the next iterations will be powered by more capable SoCs.. The Galaxy A3 (2017) has the same loudspeaker placement as its siblings. It’s located on the right side of the phone, above the power button, but while we found the speaker’s position to be a problem on the A5 and A7, it wasn’t an issue on the A3. Since the A3 has a more compact size, it’s easier to cup your hand around the speaker to get better sound that is directed towards you rather than away from you. The speaker is very loud, but the sound it produces is a little tinny to my taste (it’s like the treble has been dialed all the way up).. The earphones that come with the phone aren’t too great, with once again a noticeable lack of focus on the low frequencies (bass). For music, the phone comes with the Google Play Music app, although you can download Samsung’s own music player off the Play Store or the Galaxy Apps store. There’s Samsung’s SoundAlive feature for adjusting the music tones to your liking no matter what music app you use, and there’s also an FM radio available. As usual, headphones need to be connected for the radio to work. As for call quality, there’e nothing to complain about. The voice from the other side comes across great, and I was told my voice was clear at the other end as well.. That 2,350 mAh battery inside the A3 might seem tiny, but don’t let that fool you. The Galaxy A3 (2017) has excellent battery life and consistently manages to last until the second day, no doubt because of the efficient processor and 720p display.. Endurance is naturally less when you use the phone too much on an LTE connection, but it still manages to get to the end of a work day with relative ease, even with Always On Display turned on (AOD gets turned off when the phone is in your pocket, so that helps). There’s no fast charging support here, a feature I wish had made the cut, but the small battery doesn’t take a long time to charge even with standard charging.. The Galaxy A3 is a complete package for the Euro 329 asking price , more so than its predecessors could hope to be. The newest A3 has almost all major features of the A5 and A7 – a fingerprint sensor, Samsung Pay support, Always On Display, and IP68 water resistance. It’s admirable on Samsung’s part to offer as much as it could on this phone, which makes it well poised to take on the competition.. You could go as far as calling the Galaxy A3 (2017) a Galaxy S7 mini. The camera could be better and not blur photos as often as it does, and overall performance could also do with enhancement as the Exynos 7870 isn’t a very powerful chipset. But the A3 (2017) is still the best Samsung’s smallest Galaxy A handset has ever been, and it offers excellent value for the price.. Reviews Galaxy A3 Galaxy A3 (2017).
