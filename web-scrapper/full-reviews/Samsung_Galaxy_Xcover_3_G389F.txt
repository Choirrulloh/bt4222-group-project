Samsung used to be among the first ones to roll out the major Android update among non-Google OEMs back in the day. We’re talking about times of Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean when its Galaxy S2 and S3 were the first non-Nexus devices to get the latest Android version changing update after Google’s own sets. But now, Galaxy S8 users cannot be that sure of their sets becoming the first non-Pixel sets to receive Oreo update.. A lot has changed, like the rise of OnePlus, LG’s new software pedigree, etc. stuff, all of which means Samsung is often 3rd or 4th fastest OEM to bring the latest major Android update to their flagship device.. Why? Well, as you may know, OnePlus 3 is said to be under Oreo update testing already between selected few users, while its brethren, the OnePlus 3T , also has a functioning Oreo update leak out. And we also have Nokia in the running here — they already shared screenshots of Nokia 8 running Oreo, which means they mean some serious business with faster Oreo rollout.. As regards Samsung Oreo update, we think the rollout would begin with Galaxy S8 sets,. followed by Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S7 sets. Latest devices in other series of the Galaxy brand, like Galaxy A3/A5/A7 2017, Galaxy C5/C7/C9 Pro/C8, Galaxy J3/J5/J7 etc. would be in line for Oreo update too, but only sometime later in 2018.. Let’s find out how each series in Samsung Galaxy brand of smartphones stand as regards Android 8.0 update .. Here’s a long list of Samsung devices as regards Oreo update. in a table that mentions Oreo eligibility for each device. As also expected release date if it’s expected.. Android Oreo to the Galaxy S8 and S8+ with model numbers SM-G950F and SM-G955F. At the moment, the update is rolling out in Europe and comes with build number. In addition to Oreo, the update also installs this month’s Android security patch.. Those who took part in the beta program will receive the update ahead of others, with the OTA files weighing about 500MB. As for the rest, the files should weigh between 1GB and 1.5GB and is expected to come your way anytime from now.. Samsung has confirmed that the beta for the Galaxy S8 would end on January 15. Thus, we can expect to definitely begin the rollout of their stable Android 8.0 OTA for the public before the end of this month. yet another beta update , which is probably the final one.. Samsung ended the Galaxy Beta program late last month and even sent congratulatory messages to participants. While we don’t have a release date yet, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ on T-Mobile have already entered the testing phase. If last year’s S7 Nougat update is anything to go by, S8 and S8+ users should start receiving Oreo in a couple or so weeks.. Samsung has released one more beta version of its Galaxy S8 Oreo update. This is the 5th installment of the Oreo for S8 and S8+ , and it is hitting the registered beta devices as an OTA since yesterday.. Even though stable rollout of the Samsung’s Oreo is still under the clouds even when they have release. now, which is absurd given it’s been almost two months since the first Oreo beta was released, but Samsung has now expanded the. A report did reveal that they. It’s been two weeks since Samsung last released the second version of its beta 8.0 update for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus , and now we have the third beta hit users the UK starting today. We won’t be surprised to see it become live in the US too with immediate effect, but there’s no official word for this from Samsung yet. keep your hopes tied down, of course. The third beta is coming in as software version. Check out the full changelog of the latest Samsung Oreo beta at the above-linked page.. It wasn’t cool to get such a buggy Oreo build under the beta program, right? Well, Samsung heard us, and now have rolled out another 8.0 beta update , still Samsung Experience 9.0 obviously, and coming in as software version. G950FXXU1ZQK4 in the UK , while. What’s more, the Beta 2 update is already available for download for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus users in the USA , whether you registered under the Galaxy Beta program or not, and is working on all carriers (T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, Verizon and US Cellular) with model no. While the stable version looks destined to drop by in January 2018, we are excited to tell you that the S8 and S8+ users in the US, particularly at Sprint and T-Mobile, now have the privilege of Android 8.0 beta update as the same is now available under beta program. More details and screenshots in the device section below.. Samsung Turkey has come ahead and given us a target release date for Samsung’s Oreo update. They stopped short of mentioning the device(s) that would be treated to Oreo first of all among the large portfolio of Samsung Android phones, but it’s a given that that device is Galaxy S8 , along with its bigger sibling, the S8 Plus. Samsung Turkey revealed that we can expect them to release the Oreo update in their country sometime in early 2018, which basically sounds January 2018 to our ears.. Now, they haven’t mentioned whether this is stable Android 8.0 release, or the beta one, but given the release timing and the fact that Samsung releases beta program for European and US users, for the most part, it’s safe to assume that they are talking stable release here. Updates are released by Samsung in Turkey at around the same time Europe and India get it, so this release timing can be taken as a global release of Galaxy S8 Android 8.0 update. January 2018 isn’t exactly impressive, especially when Sony has already released the 8.0 for XZ Premium , and HTC is targeting November-end 8.0 release for U11 , while both OnePlus and Huawei have Oreo beta available for their OnePlus 3/3T and Mate 9, but we would take it happily.. Rumors have broken about Samsung testing the Oreo update for the Galaxy S8 internally. For what it’s worth, we have spotted the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus on Geekbench too, running OS build Android 8.0.0. There is no target release date available from Samsung, though, so a concrete date is not available at the moment.. We expect the beta version of S8 Oreo update to release sometime in November, and it should see further revisions itself: beta 2 Oreo build, beta 3 and maybe beta 4. FYI, it took Samsung four public beta builds of Nougat for S7 before they were able to begin rollout of 7.0 OTA for the device.. Note that Samsung usually invites its users for beta testing via registration and that not all, or many, users are selected under the program. Thus after a while, the Oreo beta would be available for selected few users only, thus your chance to get Oreo update on your Galaxy S8 is pretty much absent here.. After a month or so of testing with Galaxy S8 Oreo beta, Samsung should be able to release the stable version of Oreo update , that would become available for all Galaxy S8 users in the region in which update is released. Well, sometime in December 2017 , we guess. Which regions , you ask? Well, we expect the Galaxy S8 Oreo build to become available for the UK first, particularly with devices running BTU code, that is, unlocked S8 sets in the UK.. The Galaxy S8 Oreo update could then spread to other regions once it’s successfully launched in one region (the UK, most probably) and Europe and India stand the best chance to get the S8 Oreo OTA in its second rollout phase.. You may be wondering when the US carrier-locked variants of the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus would receive the Oreo update. Well, Verizon and Sprint could be the first ones to rollout Oreo update for their Galaxy S8 sometime in January 2017, while T-Mobile and AT&T could be seen rolling out Oreo sometime in February-March 2018. US Cellular and Canada could also get an update at around same time.. For more coverage, check out our Galaxy S8 Oreo update page.. Yet another Galaxy Note 8 Oreo build has appeared online with build number. and includes February 1, 2018, security patch level. If anything, this should imply that Oreo will roll out this month or latest next month.. There is one more Oreo update found to be available on the web for the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. The software version of this new Note 8 Oreo build is. N950FXXU2CRA1, and it comes with a hefty changelog.. Oreo update for Galaxy Note 8. has hit the web, too, but here as well, a date for the stable release remains quite unknown.. Samsung has favored its Galaxy S series for major Android update rollout and has given the Note handsets the update treatment after it’s done with flagship Galaxy S set of the year. We expect this to remain unchanged with Oreo update too, and hence the release of Galaxy Note 8 Android 8.0 build doesn’t look like happening in the year 2018.. If Samsung is able to finish rollout of S8 Oreo update by January, we can expect the Galaxy Note 8 sets start seeing OTA update notification in February itself. In early Q1 2018, the carrier locked Note 8 variants would be getting the Oreo update too.. For more coverage, check out our Galaxy Note 8 Oreo update page.. Third beta update is now rolling out as. ZQKG build for S8 and S8+ users in the UK. Find the changelog here .. Samsung has released the beta 2 version of its Android 8.0 update. If you rock a US model, SM-G950U, whether in the US or a country like India (thus, imported the device), you can download the Oreo beta 2 and install it all by yourself, manually. Samsung has begun rollout of the Oreo beta update in the US, where T-Mobile and Sprint are the launchpads of 8.0 update from Samsung. The update is available for selected users among the interested people who applied for the beta under the Galaxy Beta program .. The update is available as software version G955USQU1ZQJJ for the S8+ users, while the build is QJB for the S8 fans. Oreo firmware is not available yet, in case you’re wondering, and expect that to become available only when stable Oreo is released by Samsung, which is expected to roll out sometime by December-end, or early January 2018.. → Android Oreo update for Galaxy S8 | Galaxy S8 Plus. A Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge user in Vietnam has received an OTA update to Android Oreo, prompting suggestions that the OS might be ready for rollout. The OS has just started rolling out to the Galaxy S8 and S8+, which implies that the S7 and S7 Edge will be next in line, but probably after several weeks.. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge wouldn’t have the privilege of becoming first Oreo running handsets for Samsung, unlike Nougat when these two were Samsung’s then-current flagships. Now, S8 sets take that place. Anyhoo, Samsung would definitely update the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge to Oreo, but it would only after the rollout is complete for Galaxy S8, S8 Plus and Note 8.. Thus, a Q2 2018 release for the Galaxy S7 Oreo OTA looks very likely. The Galaxy S7 sets in Europe and India could get the Android 8.0 update before other variants, but it should be soon available in other regions, as well as carrier locked S7 sets at T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon..

After numerous uncertainties over the status of Samsung Galaxy S6 Oreo update, T-Mobile has finally. that the OS will be rolled out to the 3-year old handset, including the S6 Edge and S6 Edge+. The American carrier has updated its software update page for the Galaxy S6 series, indicating that it has agreed with Samsung to update the S6 family to Android Oreo, but we don’t know when the OS will start rolling out.. According to fresh developments, which do not come as a big surprise to us, the Galaxy S6 series won’t receive Oreo. Samsung reps have a tendency of not getting software updates’ details right and it seems this poor run won’t end anytime soon.. A leaked Galaxy Note 8 Oreo build was found to contain files with. that will be updated to Android Oreo. On the list, there was no place for the Galaxy S6 series. Although some might feel a little hard done by this new development, which is not an official communication, it makes sense because the S6 family has already received two OS upgrades and will soon be three years old, which makes it ineligible for Android 8.0 OTA.. A new report indicates that Samsung might begin rolling out the Android 8.0 update for the Galaxy S6 as early as next month, February 2018.. To be frank, we never thought about Samsung would release Android 8.0 for Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, and S6 Edge Plus. have given us ample hint that yes, Samsung has the Galaxy S6 trio in its Oreo update roadmap. Well, a user asked the Samsung’s helpline on this, not one but on multiple occasions, and every time the Samsung rep on the other side confirmed that they do have S6 sets in plans for Oreo release.. Given the usual 2-year update policy that all OEMs follow for their flagship devices, we were kinda sure that S6’s last major update has already arrived in Nougat OS, but now, it looks like the S6 sets would live to see a day in official Oreo 8.0 build from Samsung.. Though, do not expect the S6 Android 8.0 OTA to hit eligible users anytime soon. If we are to go by how much time it took Samsung to bring Nougat to all eligible devices, maybe we’re looking at Q4 2018 release for S6 Oreo. In any case, we don’t think it will arrive earlier than Q3 2018, but the end of Q3 2018 looks probable.. → Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Android 8.0 update news and downloads. Do not expect the Note 8 beta update based on Android Oreo. Beta is rolled out for the first ever major OS rollout, which for Samsung is due for Galaxy S8, and thus only Galaxy S8 would receive the Oreo update as beta. Once stable release becomes available and is rolled out to S8 and S8+ users, the same build will be worked upon to instill it with Note 8 related features, and once done and tested internally, will be rolled out to Note 8 users as a stable release. So, Note 8 users would see the Android 8.0 hit their devices directly as stable release only, not as beta — same for other Samsung devices like Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, Note FE, etc.. Well, Samsung released the Oreo as beta on October 31, 2017, for the S8 and S8+ users in the US. Which is a good sign if you were hoping for a quick release of Android 8.0 from Samsung for your Note 8. Even though it’s not set for release anytime soon, as we expect them to provide the S8 users a stable version of Oreo before beginning the rollout for the Note 8.. Now, given that Samsung would wait for feedback from users on its Oreo beta, and fix the issues found if any, this would surely takes a few months’ time. Expect the Note 8 Oreo update to become available to public — not beta — as a stable release sometime in February 2018.. → Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Android 8.0 update news and downloads. Samsung has taken all Galaxy Note 7 sets off the market it could, but it’s entirely possible that select few of you are still keeping it: either because you love it, or because it’s rare, or as a keepsake. Anyway, the thing is we really do not think Samsung would make a great effort required for preparing the Oreo update for a device, for the sake of few Note 7 users out there.. On the other hand, they have re -re-released the Note 7 as Note FE, and the Note 7 deserves the Oreo update. As the Note FE sports exactly same hardware — except for the battery, ofc — the Oreo update Samsung releases for the Note FE could be compatible with the Note 7 too. And that is how your Note 7, if you have it that’s to say, can get an official Oreo update too.. More news: Galaxy S6 Oreo update | Galaxy S6 Edge Oreo update. Expected release date: Eligible (Q2 2018). After numerous uncertainties over the status of Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Oreo update, T-Mobile has finally. that the OS will be rolled out to the 3-year old handset. The American carrier has updated its software update page for the Galaxy Note 5, indicating that it has agreed with Samsung to update the Note 5 to Android Oreo, but we don’t know when the OS will start rolling out.. According to fresh developments, which do not come as a big surprise to us, the Galaxy Note 5 won’t receive Oreo. Samsung reps have a tendency of not getting software updates’ details right and it seems this poor run won’t end anytime soon.. A leaked Galaxy Note 8 Oreo build was found to contain files with. that will be updated to Android Oreo. On the list, there was no place for the Galaxy Note 5. Although some might feel a little hard done by this new development, which is not an official communication, it makes sense because the Note 5 has already received two OS upgrades and will soon be three years old.. Given its raw power and the fact that it is powered by an Exynos processor, you won’t be short of Oreo-based custom ROMs that are regularly maintained with updates. If you like such kind of stuff, the. is a great place to begin your ROM hunting.. A new report indicates that Samsung representatives have confirmed that Oreo is in the plan for Galaxy S6, which lead us to believe that Samsung is moving towards the three-year update cycle for major Android OS updates, which is a massive increment from the update cycle of two years that all Android OEMs follow usually.. Because Samsung own helpline has confirmed the news on multiple occasions, we no longer doubt it and are pretty excited to report that at the moment, there stands a great chance of Note 5 getting official Android Oreo update. That could take time, Q3 2018 release probably, but it’s worth it.. As we mentioned above, Samsung doesn’t look like becoming first OEM to release Oreo update after Google, which is kinda sad, but its attitude towards non-flagship device’s update is far more concerning. Samsung is yet to complete Nougat rollout for devices it launched in 2016, which is why the rollout timing doesn’t look anytime near for devices like Galaxy J3, J5, and J7 (all 2017 edition), as well as Galaxy J7 Pro.. While we are sure Samsung would release the Oreo update for Galaxy J3/J5/J7 sets, it could Samsung til Q3 2018 before the first device among the many in Galaxy J brand of Samsung Android phones gets Android 8.0 OTA.. For more coverage, check out our dedicated pages on these devices:. T-Mobile has confirmed the Oreo update for their Galaxy J7 Prine, which is said to be under ‘Manufacturer development’ at the moment. That also means that T-Mobile is yet to get its hands on the update. Thus, we’re not gonna see the Oreo rollout happen anytime soon in case of the J7.. Given Samsung’s work with Nougat update, it’s fair to say that the company would definitely take a great time preparing the Android 8.0 Oreo update for its 2017 edition of Galaxy A3, A5, and A7.. Also, we have the new 2018 edition for these handsets up for release in next few months, by all means, the latest 2018 edition would receive the Oreo build before the 2017 ones.. For more coverage, check out our dedicated pages on these devices:. Given Samsung’s large portfolio of Android devices, it would take Samsung a good deal of time to update the Galaxy S8, S8 Plus, Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge to Oreo update: first for unlocked variants, and then for locker variants at various carriers in USA and across the world.. After they are done with their flagship releases of the year 2017 and 2016, their Oreo update software team would invest its time developing Oreo for the Galaxy C5, C7, C8, etc. handsets, while also working side-by-side on Galaxy A and J series of sets. All of this means Oreo update release for Galaxy C5/C7/C8 would take time, and it could be Q3 2018 easily by the time we see the Oreo OTA for first Galaxy C series handset.. Expected release date: Tab S2: Q3 2018; Tab S3: Q2 2018. Galaxy Tab S3 is easily the best Android tablet available on the market right now. It packs in best hardware in a tablet and is an eligible candidate for the Android 8.0 update too. When will Samsung release the Oreo update for the Galaxy Tab S3, though?. Well, it depends on when it is able to finish the update for Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S7. So, expect the update to arrive by end of Q2 2018.. Just our two cents: We think that before Samsung releases the Oreo OTA for the device, it would arrive as an AOSP custom ROM, most probably as LineageOS 15 ROM .. As regards Tab S2 Oreo update, well, it would happen only after Samsung is done with the Galaxy tab S3’s Oreo OTA. We think it would be released alongside Oreo rollout for devices in A/J/C series. Sometime towards the end of Q2 2018. BTW, the Tab S2 was launched by Samsung in 2016 but refreshed in 2016. It’s hard to say whether the 2015 releases would see a day in Oreo, but as regards 2016 iterations of the tab S2 tablets, we do think Samsung would take a lenient view and bring them the Android Oreo upgrade.. More news: Galaxy S6 Oreo update | Galaxy S6 Edge Oreo update. What are your thoughts on Samsung’s Oreo rollout scene?. They are slow, but is it worth it because they do have to push out Android 8.0 update for countless devices — about triple of the number of device OEMs like Sony, Motorola and HTC would release Oreo for?. Or given their size, they should finish the Oreo rollout for all eligible devices in their portfolio within 9 months maximum of Google rolling out Oreo for its Pixel sets?.

Qua specificaties is de Samsung Galaxy Xcover 3 VE te kwalificeren als een 'goede middenklasser'. De smartphone heeft een 4,5 inch groot beeldscherm, een formaat wat momenteel gezien wordt als het ideale beeldschermformaat voor smartphones aangezien het niet te groot, maar zeker ook niet te klein is. Het beeldscherm kent een resolutie van 480 x 800 pixels.. Onder de motorkap van de Samsung Galaxy Xcover 3 VE draait een 1,3 GHz quad-core processor ondersteunt door 1,5 GB aan werkgeheugen.
