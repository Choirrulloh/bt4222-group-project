Funciones clave Motorola Moto E4 Plus. Opiniones y Comentarios Motorola Moto E4 Plus. Hay 91 opiniones del Motorola Moto E4 Plus .. hola estoy teniendo problemas con mi moto lo tactil no esta funcionando lo apague y lo prendi dos veces pero ahora resulta q funciona lo tactil pero no correctamente no me deja ingresar y como q remarca las cosas con una linea verde .. lo tengo hace 3 semanas mas o menos y me es raro que funcione de esta manera, deberia llevarlo y que lo revisen o me entreguen uno nuevo ?. Tengo este telefono pero no me gusta este mk celular por dos cosas horribles feas. La primera tiene 267ppi (Pixeles por pulgada, entre mas tenga, mas nitida la imagen, el que mas tiene es el iphone X con 452ppi) Como puede ser que el Moto G4 tenga 401ppi? y siendo una generacion menor a la del E?. La camara frontal es un asco, me acabo de pasar del G4 Al E4Plus y es 10 veces mejor la del G4 y eso que no tiene flash frontal.. En que piensan los de Motorola????. Ese E4 Plus es solo huella y linternita frontal de resto es una mierda. Es igual al G4 Plus solo que mas malo menos calidad en camara y pantalla. Hola, tengo el Moto g 4 play y me gustaría cambiarlo por el Moto E 4 plus. Mi pregunta es si el E4 es superior al G4 play, para saber si vale la pena este cambio. Hola, me compré el moto e4 plus hace dos semanas la batería no me dura más de 1 día y mi uso no es muy exigente solo wsp y Facebook de vez en cuando, me podrían dar algún consejo para que mi batería dure como debe, o es problema de fabrica?. Ll3vo un m3s con el celular y es super....pero he tenido conveniente desde el 23 hasta aca .... quiero compartirle dato a una persona y le sale como si tubiera internet pero ala hora de utilizarlo no tiene....porfa sus ayuda. este celular es muy bueno,recomendable para las personas que buscan un celular sin fallas.... una pregunta,se puede colocar la fecha en la fotos que se toman con este celular?. Hola, tengo el moto e 4 plus hace varios meses y ninguna falla, me salió muy bueno. Carga rápido la batería y cuesta en descargarse, con respecto a videos de día es espectacular la calidad, de noche no tanto , las fotos salen espectacular pero le bajó un Punto en cuánto cuando hay movimientos al capturar una imagen salen borrosas. Pero igual le doy 8 puntos. Me gusta todo en si..Pero no me aparecen el número de notificaciones sobre el icono de cada aplicacion. La cámara es pésima, las fotos de cámara frontal no enfocan y quedan movidas, tenía un moto G3 y la cámara era excelente, soy la única que le sucede esto?. Me compraron para esta navidad como sorpresa este celular, yo no conozco mucho de los moto pero igual me encantó.. Hoy al despertar lo prendi y la pantalla tenía color muy raro así como opaco y se ponían líneas raras, a ratos verdes o veía un vídeo de la nada se corta se pone verde y si sigue, o puedo estar haciendo cualquier cosa y de la nada se pone de un color raro o mantengl presionado suave la pantalla y se llena de rayas, ¿que hago.?.

Sony presenta dos nuevos flagships con nuevo lenguaje de diseño: los esperados Sony Xperia XZ2 y Xperia XZ2 Compact. Una alternativa más confiable para desbloquear la pantalla del Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+: Intelligent Scan. Dos propuestas de mediana a baja gama de ZTE: Blade V9 y Blade V9 VITA, dos modelos con ligeras diferencias. Podría ocurrir que se repitan en otro lado, pero las cámaras del Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+ son algo único. Presentación oficial: el Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+ no viene con muchas sorpresas, pero igualmente deslumbra. SmartGSM es una de las comunidades de habla hispana más grandes sobre teléfonos celulares.
