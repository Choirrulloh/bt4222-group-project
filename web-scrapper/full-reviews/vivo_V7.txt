Vivo has released a brand new selfie-centric smartphone called the V7+ which is a successor of V5 +. The company has removed the secondary front camera in favor of a single one but with a higher resolution. Another apparent change is the Full View Display with 18:9 aspect ratios which resemble the likes of Samsung Galaxy S8.. The V7+ is built well and is slim and light. It's beautifully designed and looks good with its sleek profile and elongated rectangular body. It has a plastic back although it really does look like a metal from afar.

The Vivo V7+ is powered by the high-end variant in Qualcomm's 400 series, the Snapdragon 450, which uses eight ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores and Qualcomm's own Adreno 506 GPU. Performance is kind of better than the rest of the 400 series as the SoC handles multitasking and games perfectly..

This midrange phone from China will let you take selfies that can smooth out your pores.. by November 9, 2017 5:36 AM PST. Vivo's V7+ is made for selfies. Quick specs Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 4GB RAM, 64GB onboard storage 6-inch display 1,440 x 720 pixels, 18:9 display ratio 24-megapixel front camera with LED flash, 16-megapixed rear shooter Dual-SIM support. You may not know much about Chinese manufacturer Vivo, but the Vivo V7+ is a great example of what the company does well.. Vivo is doing remarkably well in the developing world with its line of lower-spec midrange. It was reported to be fifth in the world in the first quarter of this year, though the company has slipped out of the top five in the third quarter.. Sporting a full metal body, a large 6-inch display with a 18:9 ratio (though at a lower 1,440x720-pixel resolution compared to higher-end devices), the V7+ is an affordable phone with plenty to like. It's powered by a not-so-impressive octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 processor. But it comes loaded with 4GB RAM and 64GB of onboard storage, which isn't too shabby.. The phone's claim to fame isn't its modest specs, but the 24-megapixel front camera with LED flash that aims to help you take the perfect selfie with a Face Beauty mode. The mode lets you smoothen out your face and change your skin tone. But be warned: You may end up looking a bit too plastic.. The V7+ uses a Micro-USB port, not USB-C, and has a headphone jack. The LED flash also acts as a fill light, which is great, if you find yourself wanting to take a selfie in a low-light location, like a pub perhaps. And if you need to take a group picture, the phone has a mode where you rotate the phone to capture a wider shot.. Even without the 24-megapixel front camera, the Vivo V7+ would still be a decent lower-end phone. Sure the Snapdragon 450 may not be as powerful as the Snapdragon 600 and 800 range of chips, but it gets the job done. Gaming may be trickier however if you want the best graphics and fast loading times.. The Vivo V7+ isn't the best phone out there, but its selfie prowess may find it an audience. It is available in India, Pakistan, Bangladash and most of Southeast Asia (though not Singapore) for around $350, which converts to about £265 and AU$460 respectively..

Dimensions: 155.87 x 75.74 x 7.7mm. Benchmark test results of Vivo V7 Plus. Pricing and Availability of Vivo V7+. Smartphone displays with an 18:9 aspect ratio has immediately become a trend in the smartphone industry this year. Vivo, one of the fastest rising players in the mobile market, was quick to adopt.. The company came up with the Vivo V7+, a handset that followed the “18:9” trend, while still staying to its roots with its ultra large 24-megapixel selfie camera. Vivo managed to make a statement which resulted to over. 5,000 pre-orders in just one week after its official launch .. But is it really a good smartphone for its price? Let’s figure that out in our full review.. The Vivo V7+’s design is probably one of its strongest suits, but the same can’t be said about its build. The device’s 5.99-inch display with an 18:9 aspect ratio filled its face with the screen. Dubbed as “FullView”, the Vivo V7+ has an 84.4% screen-to-body aspect ratio which basically means that the front is almost all screen. And for as long as you have a dope wallpaper, you can practically change the device’s appearance depending on your preference.. But the thing is, the Vivo V7+ is only part metal. The entire hardware is being held by a metal frame, but the back panel is most certainly plastic. The device doesn’t feel cheap or second rate during my time with it. However, I do think I that it could have been better, considering the device’s premium price tag.. Nonetheless, the Vivo V7+ is amazing too look at. It has this shiny metal lines that trace the entire edges and the iPhone-like antenna bands on the top and bottom. It also has rounded corners and edges, so it sits comfortably in the hands.. There’s not enough room at its chin for buttons, so Vivo opted for on-screen ones. But on the top, they were able to cram up the 24-megapixel selfie camera, an earpiece, and all the necessary sensors.. However, since it has a tall screen, operating this device single-handedly is a difficult task. Even for a guy with large hands like me, reaching through the opposite corner is a bit uncomfortable.. At the top, we only have a pinhole for the noise-canceling microphone. The left side contains the tray that can hold two micro SIM cards and a microSD card slot. Thankfully, it’s not a hybrid setup.. On the right side, we have the lock/power switch below the volume controls. The buttons feel tactile and satisfying to press. However, I think it would have been better if they are placed a bit lower. When the device is in your right hand, you have to fully stretch your thumb to reach the lock/power switch. On the other hand, reaching the volume controls requires the user to reach all the way up.. This is just a minor complaint. If you’re a lefty like me, then your index and middle fingers can easily reach all of them.. Moving on, at the bottom we see the 3.5mm headphone jack where it should be. There’s also the primary built-in microphone, a micro USB port, and the loudspeakers.. Overall, I’m satisfied with the Vivo V7+’s design and build quality. Sure, it’s half constructed in plastic, but its good looks make up for it. Also, thanks to this setup, the device feels light to hold.. The display is one of Vivo V7+’s highlight feature. Unfortunately, it’s not without its own flaws. What we’re talking about is a 5.99-inch screen, with an HD+ pixel resolution and an aspect ratio of 18:9 — which Vivo calls as the “FullView” display.. As what I have said earlier, the device’s screen delivers a strong aesthetic appeal to the V7+. However, as a display itself, it isn’t the best. For one, the pixel count isn’t the most ideal for a screen this large and a smartphone at this price. It would have been a lot better if it was at least a FHD+ resolution.. With that said, screen sharpness isn’t really the Vivo V7+’s strongest suit. However, reading texts, even the small ones, are still bearable. And with its tall aspect ratio, you can read an entire article without having to scroll too much.. Another benefit of the FullView display is its larger screen real-estate for gaming and watching videos. You gain an advantage by being able to see more than what others can typically see. It also gives more immersion when watching videos or movies.. But since most videos are shot on 16:9, the black bars on the side will be present. You can have it fill the entire screen, but with a slight crop on the top and bottom frame. Personally, I don’t mind having the frame cropped to take advantage of the 18:9 aspect ratio. Most videos and movies are shot with the subject far from the corners, anyway.. However, quality-wise, the display still couldn’t get it right. The colors are a bit washed out with a dull contrast. For the normal eye, it sure is fine. But for picky eyes out there, you might find it a bit lacking.. Vivo is one of those few brands who value sound. Thus, they rigged the Vivo V7+ with a dedicated AK4376A HiFi audio chip/DAC. This, in theory, should improve the audio that comes out from the device via the 3.5mm headphone jack.. During my tests, the Vivo V7 Plus did great sound. The included set of earbuds had good sound quality and despite not being a pair of in-ears, the low-end/bass is still present. However, to fully take advantage of its prowess, you might need a better headphones.. The only problem is, it only works with a few apps. In the settings menu, you’d see that it’s only compatible with the built-in music and video app, YouTube, Google Play Music, and Spotify. I was kind of bummed out that it’s incompatible with Netflix because it would have made the watching experience so much better.. If the audio chip is running, you can see the HiFi icon on the status bar.. On the other hand, the loudspeaker at the bottom delivers decent performance. It has a mediocre volume, and the sound quality is good.. The Vivo V7+ is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 chipset, which is an underwhelming choice for a device at this caliber. It has an octa-core processor, 4GB of RAM, Adreno 506 GPU, and 64GB of expandable storage.. The hardware delivered satisfactory performance, however, it could have been better. Going through basic tasks like browsing through different social media apps, browsing the web through Google Chrome, and watching movies and videos on Netflix and YouTube was obviously doable. However, I noticed some occasional stutters and random lags when swiping through my feed. It’s still kinda of a norm in midrange Android smartphones today, though.. Multitasking was also seamless, thanks to the spacious 4GB of RAM. You can quickly switch between different apps in a jiffy. The opened app will also stay open despite having four to five of them running simultaneously.. Moreover, the gaming experience on the Vivo V7+ was also satisfying. I played games like NBA Live, UFC, and Stacks without any noticeable frame drops or hitch. Also, the handset’s tall but slim profile makes it really nice to handle while in landscape mode.. At the end of the day, the Vivo V7+ still provided good performance. Although, just like the display, I still feel a bit disappointed that they used cheaper hardware.. Vivo is offering a couple of ways that you can easily secure and unlock the V7+. And if you’re completely unaware, what I’m referring is its new Facial Recognition feature. This is Vivo’s answer to Samsung and Apple’s Face ID on the iPhone X .. nlike the iPhone, Vivo’s take on this security feature is a little less complex. It doesn’t have an Infrared camera, Dot Projector, or any other bizarre sensors. All it uses is the 24-megapixel selfie camera.U. But despite the hardware limitation, the Facial recognition feature of the Vivo V7 Plus works surprisingly well. For as long as your face is within the camera’s line of sight, it can instantly unlock it. You don’t even have to literally put it up straight in your face.. You can also enable the “Raise to Wake” feature on the settings menu, so you can unlock the device without touching anything. However, since it lacks an infrared camera, it does struggle at pitch black room. But if your screen is bright enough, the light that shines from it acts like a flash.. But other than facial recognition, the Vivo V7+ also rocks the old and trusty fingerprint scanner. It’s positioned at the back, within reach of the index finger. And just like its predecessors, it works well and it’s incredibly fast. Both the fingerprint scanner and facial recognition can be enabled at the same time.. The Vivo V7+ runs on the latest FunTouch OS 3.1 on top of Android 7.1.2 Nougat. The new interface brings old and new tricks for the V7+.. For one, Vivo is introducing App Clone, which basically makes two copies of the same app, but with different accounts signed in. In theory, this will help you access different apps easily. Currently, it only supports messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Line, BBM, WeChat, Zalo, and Viber. I personally didn’t utilize this feature much, since most apps I use like Instagram has decent support for multi-account management. But in case someone needs it, it’s there.. The FunTouch OS 3.1 also sports Smart Split 3.0. This lets you use two apps side-by-side, by swiping three fingers on the screen. Just like the App Clone, its app support is currently limited. It only works on some native and Google apps, and other prominent ones like Facebook.. Moreover, the Vivo V7+ also packs a lot of small but nifty features. For one there’s the “Raise to Wake”, which when partnered with facial recognition, instantly unlocks the phone without touching anything. The interface can also take long screenshots and screen recording.. Vivo is also bragging about its new “Game Mode” feature, which basically works like the “Do Not Disturb Mode”. It can reject incoming calls and block floating previews, so the user won’t get distracted during gameplay. You can configure which notification to block on the settings menu.. And just like its predecessor, the Vivo V7+ interface has the Control Panel at the bottom. It packs all the shortcut buttons, volume and brightness control, and the recently used apps. Meanwhile, the Notification Panel sits right on the top of the screen.. The camera department has played a major role in marketing most smartphones today. The higher the megapixel count, the better-sounding the device gets. While it may not necessarily translate to an overall better image quality, it still plays a vital role.. The Vivo V7+ features a 16-megapixel camera at the back and a whopping 24-megapixel one in front. Clearly, this handset still wants everyone to take selfies — just like most smartphones in the midrange category.. With that said, the V7 Plus can indeed take impressive self-portraits. The details and sharpness are top-notch. The colors are also great with just the right contrast. However, the dynamic range is a bit lacking. You can enable HDR mode, but it doesn’t really do that much.. I also liked the front-facing flash of the Vivo V7+. It beams a soft light, so it doesn’t look harsh when you snap a photo. It just acts as a fill light with a yellowish tone, so it matches perfectly to the skin.. The new Face Beauty 7.0 was also improved. It looks like each update, the artificial skin enhancement that it applies to your skin looks more natural.. And of course, we have the Portrait/Bokeh mode. If you’ve been living under the rock, this feature delivers a synthetic blurred background to make pictures look more professional. Or, if you just want to disregard the background.. Since it doesn’t have a dual-camera setup, the Bokeh feature doesn’t work that well. The foreground isn’t separated well on the background. But for as long as there’s not a lot of things going on behind the subject, the software can easily distinguish which should be in focus.. But the problem is, the Portrait Mode isn’t available on the primary camera. You do get the Face Beauty 2.0, though.. Quality-wise, the 16-megapixel primary camera of the Vivo V7+ can take good photos. The colors and contrast are good, the saturation looks natural, and the sharpness is on point. Although zooming-in reveals the usual software tricks that aim to enhance the overall image quality.. On the other hand, the dynamic range is just average. Also, I noticed that the shutter speed is a little slow. Hence, doing some run and gun street photography might be hard. You really have to aim the camera for a second or two before snapping the photo so it can get it right.. But interestingly, the sensor works well in low-light conditions. The noise and grains are now more present, but they are not heavily visible until you zoom in. Still, everything in the frame is still visible, with decent color and contrast.. Vivo is heavily marketing the V7+’s FullView display and its 24-megapixel selfie camera, but they never gave emphasis to the device’s battery performance. What we have here is a 3,225mAh battery that works well than I have ever expected. During my day-to-day use, the device would still leave me with 40% to 50% of charge before my day ends. That’s a day of browsing through social media via 4G LTE and WiFi, streaming music on Spotify, and more.. The Vivo V7 Plus also performed well with PCMark’s battery test. It took an average of 10 hours and 30 minutes before it reached 20%. For a perspective, most devices have an average score of 7 hours.. So, is the Vivo V7+ worth the hype? The answer would be a hesitant “Yes”. I admired the device during my time with it, but there were several things I wished Vivo could have done btter.. To be honest, the price-to-features ratio isn’t really that great. Vivo could have either provided more oomph in specs for its asking price, or lower the price tag to match what it has to offer. But since it’s now out in the market, I think the latter would be the only option.. Don’t get me wrong, I liked the device for what it is. The large and tall 18:9 display looks refreshing and provides a huge screen real estate for productivity for entertainment. The HD screen is slightly forgivable due to its low battery consumption (when compared to FHD).. The Snapdragon 450 octa-core processor with 4GB of RAM might not be powerful enough, but then again, all of these are forgivable if the price is right.. On the bright side, the V7+’s battery performance was top notch, the cameras offer impressive performance, and the Face ID security feature works better than expected.. The Vivo V7+ is now available nationwide in Vivo stores, kiosks, and third-party retailers for a price of Php17,990. It’s also available in Home Credit for installment plans..

Design Type called form factor refers to a mobile phone's size, shape, and style as well as the layout and position of major components of phone. There are three major form factors seen in mobile phones => bar phones, folding phones and sliding phones. 149.3 x 72.8 x 7.9 mm. SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) is a small card that contains mobile network subscriber's account information. This allows the phone using the card to attach to a mobile network. The SIM card is most commonly associated with GSM and UMTS mobile networks. Moving a SIM card from one phone to another allows a subscriber to switch mobile phones without having to contact their mobile network carrier. SIM cards can also be used by a phone to store limited amounts of data, such as phone numbers and text messages. Display Technology => A number of display technologies and types used in mobile phones => TFT (Thin Film Transistor), IPS (In-Place Switching), OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode), AMOLED (Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode), Super AMOLED (an even advanced version of AMOLED), Resistive Touchscreen (Resistive touchscreens contain two layer of conductive material with a very small gap between them which acts as a resistance), Capacitive Touchsceen (Capacitive touchscreen technology consists of a layer of glass coated with a transparent conductor). Display Colors is refers to the number of different shades of colors that the screen is capable of displaying => 64K colors, 256K colors and 16 million colors, Obviously 16M is highest available range of colors and better than others. Pixel Density (PPI) is refers to the concentration of pixels on a particular display, measured in pixels per inch (ppi). Pixel density is calculated by dividing the diagonal pixel resolution of a display by its diagonal size, higher pixel density better display quality. Display Protection => Gorilla Glass is a special alkali-aluminosilicate glass shield with exceptional damage resistance that helps protect mobile displays from scratches, drops, and bumps of everyday use, It is always better to go for a smartphone with Gorilla Glass for that added protection and peace of mind. Camera is able to capture photographs and usually videos, The most important characteristics of a camera are the resolution (measured in megapixels), lens focus type (fixed or automatic), higher megapixel cameras are known to capture higher quality photos, but not always a good measurement of the photos quality. Flash Light => There is commonly two types of flash lights are used in camera mobile phones, LED Flash (LED flash offers lower power consumption with drive circuitry that takes up very little room, LEDs can be strobed faster than any other light source), Xenon Flash (xenon flash produces an extremely intense full-spectrum white light for a very short duration). 1/3" sensor size, 1.0 µm pixel size, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR. OS => Every computer system run on a base software called Operating System (OS). Operating System controls all basic operations of the computer (such as smartphone, PDAs, tablet computers and other handheld devices). The Operating System allows the user to install and run third party applications (apps), apps are used to add new functionality to the device. UI or user interface of a device is the look and feel of the on-screen menu system. How it works, its color scheme, how it responds to button presses, all of these things are part of the user interface. Java for Mobile Devices is a set of technologies that let developers deliver applications and services to all types of mobile handsets, ranging from price efficient feature-phones to the latest smartphones.

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. The Vivo V7+, with an 18:9 aspect ratio display.. "China speed" is one of the recent buzzwords westerners who work with or cover the Chinese tech hardware have been using. It describes the cut throat nature and breakneck pace of the Chinese consumer electronic market, particularly the smartphone scene.. Just this past February I tested its V5 phone , which was billed as "the perfect selfie phone," and now, not even October, I already am testing the V7+.. If you're wondering why I didn't test the V6, it's because the V6 is like the Samsung Galaxy Note 6, OnePlus 4 and iPhone 9 -- they don't exist. Vivo has joined the "skipping a number" naming strategy with this line of selfie-centric device. Vivo didn't just jump a number, it bulked up to a "Plus" despite there being no "standard" V7.. Much like the V5, Vivo has placed all the attention to the V7+'s selfie camera -- it's a whopping 24-megspixel lens. The rest of the specs are mid-range: there's a Snapdragon 450 chipset, and the display resolution is just 720p.. But the device does look quite nice. T his isn't just a lazy rehash of a previous device with the exact same body and slightly newer chip (like the iPhone 8), the V7 impressively has followed in LG and Samsung's footsteps in that it's a slim-bezeled device with an 18:9 aspect ratio display with rounded corners. Now the craftsmanship of the V7's new display design is good, but it ultimately can't compare to the LG V30 or Galaxy Note 8. The corners of the V7+'s display are not naturally rounded like those South Korean devices but seem to be just artificially covered by a bezel with round corners. The forehead and chin, while slim, aren't quite at LG/Samsung levels.. (Mainstream media from here on out will refer to all edge-to-edge screens as "iPhone X-like," which is a bit misleading because this phrasing implies Apple was the trendsetter. LG and Samsung and Xiaomi deserve credit for this new phone movement that everyone else, including Apple, are following). The camera has a slight bump in the back.. Vivo's software experiences has improved drastically from previous devices. The skin is clean, and the Android software version is a relatively up-to-date 7.1.2. Vivo still insists on putting the back button on the right side of the device (which I don't like) but we now have the option to swap it to the other side. In fact, Vivo is taking full advantage of that large 6-inch screen by giving us an option to remove navigation buttons completely in favor of swiping gestures. Here's how it works: you simply swipe from the bottom of the screen where the navigation buttons would be to trigger that action. So swiping up from the middle of the screen is like tapping the home button, swiping from the left side of the screen goes "back." It takes about 20 minutes to get used to but after that it becomes second nature. This is a clever way to work around the problem some phonemakers hasn't figured out yet. For example, the LG V30 is a brilliant phone, but you can't hide the navigation buttons, ever. It's quite disappointing to open up an Instagram Story (which supposedly takes up the full display) only to see a row of buttons at the bottom. Other phones, like the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2, has the row of buttons appear and disappear depending on your finger gesture, and it's a set-up that can be hit or miss -- sometimes I'm trying to tap a button just as its disappearing. Vivo's set-up feels the best of both worlds.. (To see more, please check out my video hands on below).. You can swap the order of the back button or have no button at all,. Unfortunately, this phone's stand-out feature -- that selfie camera -- is the one aspect of a phone I use the least (I despise taking selfies), so I'm perhaps the wrong person to test this phone. For my full review I'll be sure to pass this device to a selfie-loving friend to get her opinion. But below are some quick photo samples anyway. The rear camera is solid -- images can be punch, but the details are a bit soft. But that front camera seems really good so far -- it blew up my face to such a large size on the monitor it was quite uncomfortable for me to see all my blemishes and zits up close.. An HDR shot taken with the V7+.. The problem with the Vivo V7+ may be its price: US$370. This is a bit high considering the sub-par chipset and 720p display. The reason for the relatively high price tag is because Vivo is only selling this phone. in physical stores in Southeast Asia (officially, anyway, this device will no doubt be available on online retailers), and as I've written before , selling offline means the company has to mark up pricing a bit (to cover overhead costs). Vivo and Oppo relied on this offline business model exclusively to overtake Xiaomi in recent years, because even though buying offline at stores is more expensive, to many people in rural China or Southeast Asia, that's the only way they know how.. The V7+ does have its strength though,. and going just by aesthetics, it doesn't seem outdated next to a Samsung Galaxy Note 8, unlike the iPhone 8. I'll be back with a full review in a week.. I've started a YouTube channel in an effort to provide multi-media coverage of gadgets I come across. If you're interested, please subscribe..

But the MI Max 2 is the different story I mean it is a very huge phone so if you want a huge phone with a huge battery in Moto X4 all the Oppo Vivo doesn't stand tall in front of this beast from xiaomi.

Android 7.1 Nougat with Funtouch OS 3.2. 5.7-inch IPS capacitive HD+ 18:9 FullView display,. 64-bit 1.5GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. Expandable up to 256GB via microSD. PDAF, f/2.0, LED flash, 1080p video recording. Pricing and Availability of Vivo V7. Midrange smartphones offer the perfect sweet spot for the Asian market, especially here in the Philippines. It’s the same reason why it achieved success here in the country.. Both the likes of OPPO and Vivo have harnessed this fact. Partnered with intensive marketing muscle, their smartphones can now be seen in the hands of a lot of people.. And with the Vivo V7 , it seems that Vivo wants you to turn to their brand, in case the V7+ didn’t convince you to do so.. But will the V7 finally make you switch? Or is it another pass? Read on.. The Vivo V7 is a complete replica of its older brother, the V7+. for the smaller screen, you can really not tell the difference between the two.. The V7 has the same plastic build at the back, so don’t be fooled by its metallic look. The antenna bands on top and bottom have the same shape with the iPhones. However, they do have a shiny tint so we’ll give it a pass.. It also retains the curved back and edges, which is really common to most handsets today. It gives better comfort and improves ergonomics when holding the device. Plus, since it has a smaller screen, I find the Vivo V7 more comfortable in the hands than the larger V7+.. Quite noticeably, the phone also feels lighter. This is probably due to the smaller battery inside it. The device’s highlight feature is seen right in front. It packs a 5.7-inch FullView screen with its 18:9 aspect ratio and ultra-thin bezels. The front of the device is mostly populated by the screen, which, in return, provides a pretty striking look. So make sure that your wallpaper looks dope to take advantage of it.. See also: Vivo V7+ Review. The top corner houses the earpiece, a 24-megapixel front camera, LED flash, proximity and ambient light sensor. Now that the bottom bezel is really thin, the capacitive buttons were morphed into on-screen keys.. And just like what most manufacturers are doing, the fingerprint scanner has been relocated to the back, just within reach of your index finger.. Overall, I’m pretty satisfied with the Vivo V7’s design. But the thing is, the Huawei Nova 2i has set the standard really high with its all-metal build. So clearly, the V7 still has a lot of catching up to do in this department.. Other than the design, the Vivo V7 was also left behind by the competition in the display department. For some reason, Vivo only managed to come up with an HD+ resolution to its 5.7-inch IPS screen. That’s only 1440 x 720 pixels stretched to accommodate the large display.. For comparison, a rival like the OPPO F5 Youth is already boasting a sharper FHD+. It even has a bigger size, which is at 6-inches.. The difference between the two resolutions is barely noticeable. But if you look closely, especially on small texts, the individual pixels are more distinct on an HD+ screen.. But if you can get past the slightly failing sharpness, the display does offer good and natural colors. The saturation is also well modulated with no yellowish tone that we see on other devices.. Its tall and wide 18:9 aspect ratio also provides a more immersive viewing experience. It can easily project an entire webpage, so you don’t have to scroll a lot when you’re reading an article.. Besides having a smaller display, the Vivo V7 also didn’t get the dedicated HiFi audio chip that the V7+ has. But despite that, the difference in sound quality is really. The sound blasting from a plugged in headphones was loud, with good clarity, and pronounced bass and treble levels.. But if a headphone is not within reach, the bottom-firing loudspeakers also deliver impressive performance. The volume is loud, the bass is audible, and the treble is pretty clean.. Vivo used the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 chipset from the V7+ to the V7. And even with the slightly cheaper price tag, the use of such processor is still hardly justifiable.. This smartphone is an eight-core workhorse that’s supported by 4GB of RAM, Adreno 506 GPU, and 32GB of internal storage that can go up to 256GB.. The Vivo V7 delivers usable performance overall, but nothing that can blow you away. Basic apps and day-to-day smartphone activities were handled decently. However, you can expect a lot of occasional hiccups and lags, especially on intensive apps and games.. It can also handle a lot of game titles well. Both Need For Speed: No Limits and NBA Live ran at decent frame rates, but then again, you can expect some minor lags here and there. I could say that it’s pretty enjoyable considering its large screen.. Just like most of the competition, the Vivo V7 is equipped with two, slightly advanced, security features.. First, we have the fingerprint scanner. And thanks to its almost-borderless nature, Vivo was forced to relocate the said sensor. It’s now placed at the back, right within your index finger’s reach for easy access.. The fingerprint scanner works really well. It has almost a 90% success rate of detecting my fingerprint right, and it unlocks incredibly fast.. But if using a fingerprint as a form of authentication is old technology for you, you can also use its facial recognition feature. This utilizes the Vivo V7’s 24-megapixel camera to detect if it’s really you who’s trying to access the device.. But unlike the fingerprint scanner, the facial recognition feature only works at around 60% to 70% during my testing. Sometimes I still have to put it right up on my face for it recognize it, making the use of the fingerprint scanner more practical and seamless.. The Vivo V7 runs on Android 7.1 Nougat, coupled with Vivo’s own FunTouch OS 3.2. I would still pick Android’s native look any time of the day, but I guess we’ll just have to get used to seeing this kind of alterations.. The FunTouch OS 3.2 isn’t the cleanest manufacturer-made interface around, but it will do. This new version allows the users to further utilize the device’s wide, FullView screen while also incorporating some design queues that’s a signature of Vivo.. The control center at the bottom houses all the basic commands and shortcuts, so you can toggle any of them within reach. Meanwhile, the top is where your unseen notifications rest on their own. You can also swipe down from the home screen to reveal the worldwide search, which can show suggestions locally (Apps, Files, etc.) and via the web.. FunTouch OS 3.2 also brings other nifty features to the Vivo V7. Some of which are becoming a standard issue to most devices today.. We have smart motion and off-screen gesture commands, one-hand mode, App Clone for easily multi-account management, and Smart Click (Pressing the volume down while the screen off enables a command of choice).. And of course, we have the Split Screen mode. This allows you to further utilize the wide screen real-estate by using two apps at once, side by side.. The FunTouch OS 3.2 might not be the most flawless Android skin around, but it does manage to bring out the best in the Vivo V7. Let’s just hope that the device will get continued updates in the future, although that’s highly unlikely given their track record.. In their recent releases, Vivo has proven that they have mastered the art of selfies. Other than us, a lot of people who have owned a recent Vivo smartphone can attest to that claim. And if you’re one of those people, you would also like this one.. Just like the V7+, the Vivo V7 brags a 24-megapixel front-facing camera. These devices have one of the highest selfie camera resolutions around. Combined with its Face Beauty 7.0, the V7 can indeed take Instagram-able self-portraits.. Read next: OPPO F5 Review. The camera can take really sharp photos, with natural tones, and a slightly off but acceptable contrast. The 24-megapixel sensor also performed well in low-light scenarios. The grains and noises are now more visible due to the s cranked-up ISO level, but it’still fairly usable.. And in case it gets really dark, the front-facing flash also acts a Fill Lighting so it doesn’t look really harsh with overblown exposure after the shot was taken.. Moreover, the Face Beauty 7.0 also works really well. Although you have to set the right Buffing, Skin Tone, and Whitening levels to achieve the right effect to match your skin.. The Bokeh/Portrait mode also works great. The foreground isolation from the background was pretty spot on. There’s not a lot of that cut-out look that you’d normally get in other devices, so I can say that’s I pretty impressed.. Moving on, at the back we have the 13-megapixel primary camera which can also take good photos. In good lighting, the images taken looks desirable and then gets a little worse as the sun goes down. Don’t worry though, as almost every smartphone camera in the world is guilty of having this flaw.. With that said, the colors looked a little plain but it leaves you more flexibility to alter things around on the editing. The contrast could have been a better and the dynamic range is not the best that we have seen, but we’re just nitpicking now.. Overall, both the front and rear cameras’ performance managed to meet my expectations. And for everyone else, I’m pretty confident that you’d enjoy shooting with this thing.. For the price tag, you can expect that Vivo has got everything covered in the connectivity department. Vivo should have incorporated NFC, USB Type-C, and. an IR Blaster to the V7, but we’ll give them a pass since not a lot of users have yet to adopt these technologies anyway.. What we’re getting here is the basic 4G LTE, WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, and a microUSB 2.0 port. None of them are on the latest version, but they are still acceptable by today’s standards.. I was able to browse the internet via 4G LTE or on our home network without any problems. The device also seamlessly connected with our Sembrandt SB750 soundbar in the office and played music without any significant noticeable drop in the signal.. Probably the only benefit of only having an HD screen is that it consumes less battery. And during my time with the Vivo V7, the handset indeed played nice with its 3000mAh battery.. The device was able to last me throughout a day of casual use. I was still left with around 15% to 20% of charge left before going to bed. That’s a day of browsing the web via 4G LTE from time to time, streaming music through a Bluetooth speaker, and some casual picture-taking.. I also ran PCMark’s battery longevity test, and the Vivo V7 did last for around 9 hours before reaching 20%. That’s 9 hours of non-stop synthetic tasks and screen-on time which is clearly far beyond what other smartphones can get.. Vivo came up with a fine device with the V7. All is good, but not until you consider the price.. In conclusion, we realize that the Vivo V7 has what it takes to be a good smartphone. The design is decent, the use of plastic made it really light and portable. The screen, despite the lower resolution, offers good colors and a lot of space to work on.. And of course, let’s not forget the battery that lasts for more than a day which is a rare find in smartphones today.. But then again, I’m not sure if those are already enough to justify its price tag. For a comparison, the Huawei Nova 2i , which retails for the same exact price, offers a more compelling value for the price when we take the hardware into consideration.. But if taking selfies and a long battery life are a top priority, then the Vivo V7 is a safe bet. You might just want to wait till the price goes down, which I’m guessing won’t happen anytime soon. But who knows, maybe the company might decide to cut it down in early 2018?. You can get the Vivo V7 for Php14,990 and it’s now available in different Vivo concept stores and kiosks nationwide..

The Vivo V7 Plus is great for selfies, and not much else. Geekbench 4: Single-Core: 764; Multi-Core: 3,925. 3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 430. Vivo, a Chinese smartphone manufacturer, is attracting a lot of attention at the moment due to its work on an under-glass fingerprint. This technology, which hasn’t been perfected by Apple. yet, will debut on a Vivo phone in the near future. It won’t be the first time Vivo has been a phone trendsetter; but it’s likely the first time you’re hearing about its devices — you won’t find Vivo phones sold in the U.S. This is an incredible selfie phone.. But through small steps, Vivo’s international reach is increasing , especially with the launch of the Vivo V7 Plus. Starting out in China and followed by India , the phone is now destined to launch in Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, and several other regions. It’s evidence of Vivo stretching out further into the world. In our Vivo V7 Plus review, we find out if the company is ready for prime time outside China.. The reason you’ll want to buy the Vivo V7 Plus is the camera, and not just the rear camera either: This is an incredible selfie phone. The front camera has 24 megapixels and an f/2.0 aperture, along with a Portrait mode, HDR, and a comprehensive beauty mode. Those are better specifications than many other rear cameras, but does it make a difference? It really does, and the selfies you take with the V7 Plus are impressive. With beauty mode active, you have the option of adjusting three parameters — skin buffing, whitening, and skin tone — and provided you don’t just turn them all up to maximum, it’s easy to retain a normal, human look. Just without those tiny little flaws we’d rather hide.. Portrait mode depends on software to blur out the background, rather than a second lens, and it does a good job in normal lighting. It avoids blurring out glasses, but while it can get a little confused with ears, it otherwise effectively isolates your face. The HDR mode isn’t so great, and we often struggled to see the difference when it was turned on. There’s a front-facing flash, a wide array of filters, and a group selfie mode too. Simply put — if you want to take selfies, the V7 Plus is an absolute master.. The rear camera hasn’t been forgotten either. It has a single-lens 16-megapixel camera with the same f/2.0 aperture, as well as the beauty mode from the selfie camera too. It’s well-tuned, fast to react, and easy to use. Put up against two other similarly-priced phones, the Vivo V7 Plus took our favorite shot of the afternoon — a clock tower highlighted against clouds and the setting sun, complete with birds flying away to roost. The Vivo V7 Plus took photos we liked with both the front and the rear camera.. Oddly there’s no grid option under the settings, and it has one of those pointless Apple Live Photo rip-offs that we struggle to find a use for. This leads us from the Vivo V7 Plus’ major selling point, to its worst aspect — the software. It runs Android 7.1.2 with November 2017’s security patch, which is an unfortunate, but acceptable start. The current version of Android is version 8.0 with the January security patch. But what bothers us more is how the operating system is covered with Vivo’s own FunTouchOS “theme” or user interface. FunTouch is not much fun at all.. FunTouch is not much fun at all.. We’re not fans of FunTouchOS mainly because it makes you relearn everything you know from other Android phones. Looking for the brightness control? It’s in the notification shade, right? No, it’s actually in a pull up drawer from the bottom of the screen, along with all the other shortcuts. There’s no app drawer, the notifications are massive cards that drop down into view, the network connectivity icon is on the opposite side, and there are various pre-installed apps. It’s not slow, and we didn’t experience any app incompatibility — so it’s not that it doesn’t work — it just wants to be different for no apparent reason. We do like the customizable themes though, accessed through a pre-installed themes app, and Google Play along with all the Google apps are also ready to go. Still, we couldn’t put down the desire to change the launcher on the Vivo V7 Plus.. The Vivo V7 Plus looks good, especially in the black seen here. It’s understated, the antenna bands are split into subtle tram lines around the top and bottom of the device, and the fingerprint sensor is well-placed on the back of the phone. The 6-inch screen has minimal bezels. for a really modern look, but we’re disappointed with the 720 x 1,440 pixel resolution. It’s too low, and ruins what could have been a pleasant experience watching high definition video on a large screen. Other quibbles include a MicroUSB charging port rather than a USB Type-C; but at least there is a 3.5mm headphone port.. The phone is powered by a Snapdragon 625 processor with 4GB of RAM, and we ran some benchmark tests to see how it compares to the competition.. The Vivo V7 Plus costs around $350. Do note, if you decide to import one to the U.S., it won’t connect to a 4G LTE service, only 3G, and it’s a GSM phone for use with AT&T or T-Mobile. The price puts it in competition with the Motorola X4 , the HTC U11 Life , and beyond the Honor 7X. Its benchmark results are less impressive than the Moto and the HTC phones, and very similar to the Honor 7X. We played Riptide GP2 and found the V7 Plus works well as a gaming device. There’s even a handy little shortcut in the pull-up menu to activate a game mode to silence notifications.. We’re a little confused by the Vivo V7 Plus. The cameras are superb, the screen — although modern looking — isn’t so good, the price is a little too high, and the user interface is quite frustrating. It comes close, but we can’t recommend this phone. If you can live with the operating system, the selfie experience truly stands apart from other phones at this price..

Smartphones mean different things to different people, but they’re so ubiquitous that catering to a niche can be rewarding. For the average smartphone maker in 2017, finding and catering to these niches is important.. The Vivo V7 Plus could easily be dismissed as yet another Chinese smartphone, but it’s not. With a 24 MP selfie camera, an 18:9 display and a brand-new Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 chipset , the phone is far from average and is targeting a specific audience. Does that still make it a worthwhile device, however?. The Vivo V7 Plus features a 5.99-inch 18:9 display. Most smartphones today are rectangular slabs, but the Vivo V7 Plus takes a page or two from Samsung’s and LG’s books and goes the 18:9 route. It’s still a rectangular slab, but this time, it’s an elongated rectangular slab. As a bonus, the bezels are also quite small.. The device is made of plastic and glass. The rear looks like metal, but don’t get fooled into thinking that it’s the real thing. The 2.5D glass on the front curves into a raised plastic lip and not seamlessly into the sides of the device. At this price, that’s alright, but I do expect to find higher quality materials and finish at Rs 22,000.. The phone is light and a bit slippery, but because it’s so light, it won’t fall out of your hands as easily as, say, an iPhone 7. The narrow bezels and taller display also mean that the phone is easier to grip.. You’ll find a single camera and flash unit on the rear, a power button and volume controls on the right, the dual-SIM+microSD card slot on the right and a headphone jack, speaker grille and microUSB port at the bottom.. Despite the plastic, the phone feels sturdy. There’s no flex or squeaking anywhere. We’ve seen better bodies on devices like the Xiaomi Mi A1 , but the V7 Plus isn’t disappointing.. The hardware in this phone is interesting indeed. First, this is the first phone to feature Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 450 platform, and that’s exciting. Second, the phone features a mammoth 24 MP selfie camera that’s worth checking out.. The rest of the specs include a 5.99-inch 18:9 HD display (1440x720), a 16 MP rear camera, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB of onboard storage, support for 256 GB microSD cards and a 3,225 mAh battery.. Connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n/ac, FM radio, microUSB 2.0, USB OTG, LTE and dual-nano-SIM support. It’s also nice that you can use two SIM cards as well as a microSD card rather than feel restricted by the hybrid SIM tray in most dual-SIM phones.. The V7 Plus' display is far from sharp. Pixels are visible to the naked eye.. As mentioned earlier, the phone features a 5.99-inch IPS LCD HD display (1440x720) in an 18:9 aspect ratio. This is the same aspect ratio that you’ll find on the Samsung Galaxy S8 or LG G6.. The screen is bright enough for use in sunlight and its colour reproduction is decent. In terms of colour quality, it’s an average screen. The biggest problem with the display, however, is its resolution. At 5.99-inches, the screen is large, taller, in fact, than that of the iPhone 8 Plus.. While most phones we’ve seen with 5.5-inch screens offer full HD displays, including the much cheaper Redmi Note 4 and Mi A1 , this device only offers an HD display. At first glance, you won’t notice the pixels, but use the phone for a bit and you’ll start noticing them. These pixels become more prominent in videos, when you’ll hold the screen closer to your face. VR content is simply out of the question when you can see the pixels as is.. The lower resolution screen should contribute to better battery life and a snappier system, however. It’s not a trade-off that I want to make, not at this price, but if you’re fine with it, go ahead.. The phone is running a custom skin over Android 7.1.2. I’m normally very critical of phones that don’t use stock Android. Most skinned versions of Android are a pain to use, feature design decisions that make no sense and include features for the sake of including them. Stock Android is nice because it works well, doesn’t hog system resources and there’s a consistency to the OS.. Vivo’s Funtouch OS 3.2 (on top of Android 7.1.2) was, for me, a surprise. It’s a heavily customised, iOS-inspired OS that I would normally have been horrified to have on my phone. However, Vivo has done a really good job with the tweaks. The design is a direct iOS rip-off, but the new feature that Vivo has added are nice, useful and work well. They’re not janky, they don’t stutter and they don’t throw up errors at random.. The design of the skin is clearly "inspired" by iOS. My favourite features on iOS are raise-to-wake and system-wide search. Vivo’s faithfully aped both these features and they work well. Vivo has also one-upped Apple by offering a face unlock feature that works incredibly well with raise-to-wake. You just pick up the phone and it unlocks, brilliant and simple, if unsecure.. Speaking of security, Vivo very clearly explains that face unlock is not secure and that, in fact, the feature can be speeded up by further reducing the security standards. Honestly, this is how Face Unlock should have been advertised to begin with. For most of us, I think, it’s a convenience. The average person who finds your phone will not be able unlock your device. Anyone who’s concerned about security should be shunning any form of biometric authentication anyway.. Face unlock is far from secure, but it is fast and can be useful.. If you don’t want to use Face Unlock, you can use your fingerprint to unlock the device. The fingerprint sensor is located on the back of the device.. Either form of authentication is very fast and the device unlocks instantly.. Split view, a standard feature in Android now, has been available for a while. I’ve never used it much because I’ve never felt the need to run two apps side-by-side on a smartphone. However, Vivo’s implementation makes a pretty strong case for the feature. When you get a message via the default messaging app or on Facebook, you get a small chat bubble that you can simply drag into your fullscreen app. I found this very convenient when watching videos on YouTube, for example.. Split-screen multitasking has been well implemented, but it needs to support more apps. Several non-standard gestures including swipe-to-unlock, shake to turn on the flashlight, tilt to zoom, air gestures and more are supported. I had fun experimenting with them, turning features on and off until I found the feature set that I was happiest with.. Of course, the upward swipe for the control centre and the downward swipe for system-wide search that Vivo stole from iOS are much appreciated on Android. Putting aside ethical conundrums, they’re undeniably useful.. The split-screen feature is especially useful when dealing with messages.. Additional battery saving features that help users monitor background battery usage are nice as well. You also get a settings menu that shows you the amount of power consumed by specific background apps and toggles to disable their background processes.. Overall, except for the rip-off design, I’m happy with what Vivo is doing with Android.. When I first saw the specifications of the phone, I was worried that the Snapdragon 450 wouldn’t be up to scratch. Low performance on a sub-Rs 10,000 handset like the Redmi 4A is fine, but not on a device that costs Rs 22,000. At this price, I was expecting to see something like a Snapdragon 625 or equivalent MediaTek platform. The Rs 12,000 Redmi Note 4 and the Rs 15,000 Mi A1 both offer a 625 for a fraction of the Vivo’s price.. Vivo V7 Plus benchmark scores - Tech2 Infogram. Thankfully, the situation wasn’t as bad as I expected. It’s testament to Qualcomm’s work and Vivo’s OS that the device felt snappy throughout the time I spent with it. Heavy websites did stutter on occasion and games like Real Racing 3 , while they ran smoothly, ran at a much lower resolution. In contrast, the Nokia 6 (review coming shortly) with its Snapdragon 430, was a nightmare to use. The combination of the full HD screen and SD430 meant that the Nokia 6 offered a nightmarishly slow Android experience that I’d rather not relive.. On the V7 Plus, everything just happened smoothly. I suspect that the lower resolution screen has something to do with the V7 Plus’ smooth performance. As you can see from the graphs, notably the GFXBench score, the Vivo V7 Plus does really well for itself, beating more powerful chips. The GFXBench test runs a game at the device' native resolution, so it clearly has a frame-rate advantage over more powerful, better specced rivals. In other words, you're getting great performance, but at the cost of fidelity.. Biometric performance was particularly fast and I never felt that the phone was lagging.. The speaker was quite loud, louder in fact, than my iPhone 6s Plus.. There's only a single camera unit on the back. Mumbai weather being what it is, most of my time with the device was spent indoors and thus, most of the images were taken indoors. The device not being waterproof was a downer and I couldn’t take pictures with it in the pouring rain. That said, the Vivo V7 Plus made a decent showing for itself in all conditions.. The 24 MP selfie camera is quite good, but it's overshadowed by the dual camera on the V5 Plus. The phone features a 24 MP f/2.0 front camera and a 16 MP f/2.0 rear camera. Honestly, the selfies from the phone are quite impressive. The front camera supports autofocus, for example, and focuses almost instantly. HDR and some “beautifications” modes are also supported. Selfies were sharper and had better colour reproduction than other selfie cameras in this price range.. The rear camera wasn’t bad either. It was also just as fast to focus and the images it captured were as expected for a camera in this price bracket. Colours were pleasant and enough details were captured to make the photograph seem nice. You can’t really crop the images of course, but for using as is, this camera captures good enough images.. Images in moderately low lighting are noisy and aggressive noise-reduction algorithms blur out textures.. The camera app has enough features to keep most of us happy.. Vivo’s own V5 Plus offers a much better camera and one-ups the V7 Plus with a dual front camera. Portrait selfies were a thing before Apple’s iPhone X and TrueDepth sensor .. Of course, the V5 Plus is more expensive and more powerful, and is now retailing at the same price as the V7 Plus.. Battery life is decent for a device in this range. The OS also gives a lot of control over background apps, which improves real-world battery life.. The 3,225 mAh battery is about average for a smartphone today. Our standard PCMark Battery Life Work 2.0 test estimated that this phone would last around 8 hours and 43 minutes. We’ve seen phones last much longer in the same test, but those have usually had larger batteries.. In real-world usage, I found this phone to be lasting me between 1-1.5 days of use, which is quite impressive and better than many other Android devices that I’ve used. For the same usage, which usually involves 2-3 hours of video, at least two hours of audio over Bluetooth, responding to a 100-odd messages and email, a handful of calls and some light gaming, my iPhone 6s Plus lasts about 12 hours.. I was surprised to find myself warming to the Vivo V7 Plus. I normally shun heavily-themed Android devices with low-end chips. However, Vivo’s customisations are useful and add value. The Snapdragon 450, a yet untested platform, certainly proved more capable than I expected.. As surprisingly good as the V7 Plus is, I don’t think I can recommend it without adding some caveats.. If you play games and need more power, get the cheaper Xiaomi Mi A1 or Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. If you expect a sharp display, Xiaomi, again, offers the better option.. If you expect great selfies, the Vivo V5 Plus offers better selfies.. If you really want an 18:9 display, great battery life and among the best front cameras in its price range, the Vivo V7 Plus might appeal.. The biggest competitor to the V7 Plus, however, is Vivo’s own V5 Plus. The phone debuted in April this year, and while a few months old, it’s the more powerful, capable version of the V7 Plus. Better yet, the V5 Plus features a dual-front camera that offers a portrait selfie mode that is leagues ahead of most selfie cameras in the market today, let alone that on the V7 Plus.. Right now, the V5 Plus is available for just Rs 23,000, which is just Rs 1,000 more than the V7 Plus, and this was the phone that we called the best selfie smartphone that money can buy.. Given the V5 Plus’ price, the only reason you’d pick up the V7 Plus is if you’re in love with that 18:9 aspect ratio.. The Vivo V7+ features a 5.99-inch HD IPS display with a resolution of 1440 x 720 pixels and is powered by a 1.8GHz octa core processor and has 4GB of RAM. It comes with 64GB of inbuilt storage, expandable upto 256GB and has a 16.0-megapixel rear camera and 24.0-megapixel front camera. It comes with Android 7.1 Nougat OS and support a 3225mAh battery capacity with 3G & 4G.. Night, Ultra HD, PPT, Anti-Shake, Professional, Slow, Time-Lapse. 75.74 x 7.7 x 155.87 mm.
