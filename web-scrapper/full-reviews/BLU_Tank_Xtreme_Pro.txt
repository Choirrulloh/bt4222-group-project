There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great For The Price You Pay. The phone itself I feel is absolutely wonderful for its price point. Its clear the company had to take away some things to give users a rugged waterproof design. The phone itself is clearly designed for people that value dependability over the best in class processor and whatnot. I'm very basic with my smartphone needs. I use my phone to check my emails, news, and weather. I occasionally need a gps and maybe a few of the apps you can use like tools such as a wifi analyzer. For me, a person that is always on a budget, but loves to hike and works in an environment where phone damage is all too common, this is perfect. Pros: -Rugged Design (obviously) -Pre-installed Screen Protector + Extra In Box -Vibrant 5" Screen -Nice Loud Speaker -Without the extra case, the buttons are incredibly easy and comfortable to press. Even gets 2 bars inside of an insulated cooler where everyone elses phone drops their signal. Cons: -No Notification Light (If you need it, however I'm enjoying not eyeing my phone all the time for messages) -The case that comes with the phone can make it a little hard to press the buttons -Camera isn't the best, in dark conditions can lag when taking pictures -Its got weight but I don't know if you want to consider this a con considering the weight = a large battery + structurally sound body. Final Note: If you are on a budget, and would like a phone that just simply gets the job done, doesn't really need to take pictures but rather do the basics like I have listed initially, and would like a little more peace of mind carrying your phone around, this is for you. If you are looking for some out of this world processing, picture taking experience you're going to want to shell out more money and purchase other models. These are built exactly like rugged computers, with enough power to get stuff done not to out perform high end machines.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars So far so good, the phone is fast to react considering the .... So far so good, the phone is fast to react considering the lack of RAM and and ROM of newer phones. I got this phone due to the ip68, since I kayak alot. I am actually very impressed by it's functionality. The camera is not to bad considering the lack of pixels either. The only drawback if any would be the sound quality of music and it's lack of bass and mids, thought with the constructiaul design this is expected. Considering I own an S8 also this phone is quite ok for it's price and I'm happy.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Well made phone.. PROS = Well made phone will take a beating. Long lasting battery time Nice Screen to view CONS = Ate 550 megs of my data right on start up for a update I could not stop. Was of no help when trying to figure out how to install a sim card in it. 3 stars at best due to the instruction book being so poor. Would have been 4 if not for that. After a week I have changed my mind. It gets 4 stars for being so well made and tough. Has a really nice look to it also and people do comment. Nice strong blue tooth works from almost 50 feet away. For the money it is a real deal. works as well as any other droid phone. I'll be keeping this phone till it dies. OH and I have found out how you can get another battery and change it out if needed.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars For a lawn-man. My father in law immediately fell in love with this phone. He does lawns for a living and you can imagine sweat and grass does not go well for normal phones. This one is tough, and has survived thus far. His last normal smartphone only lasted a week, and then it didn't. This one will stand up to the abuse. So far he has had I since Christmas. It comes with a clear silicon case. When he went to activate it at ATT, the store rep wanted to know where he could get one too. I have had many BLU Products phones and have always been satisfied with their price performance ratio. From what he said, if using on ATT, you or the store will have to manually input the APN settings. T-Mobile has always auto-configured for me. I would say I'm happy with it's quality. I haven't heard any complaints yet from him. Was this review helpful to you?. Everything I had expected in a great quality cell phone. Had to get micro SIM card but no issue setting it up. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great cell phone also water resistant for motorcycling.. I've had the phone over 6 months now and still works great. Still responds fast and gets good signal. 5.0 out of 5 stars ... the phone over 6 months now and still works great. Still responds fast and gets good signal. Had the phone for less than a month. Kept freezing and shutting down sporadically. Also programs critical to o.s systems would suddenly stop working. 1.0 out of 5 stars Contacted Blu customer service and their advice was to do a "Hard Reset" followed instructions and still no good.. My husband liked the Tank Xtreme 5.0. He likes this Tank Xtreme PRO even better. All around nice improvements to the phone. 5.0 out of 5 stars Nice, tough, inexpensive smartphone for the jobsite.. I was with Kyocera forever until they stopped using Gorilla Glass. Ended up cracking the glass on my Kyocera Duraforce. 5.0 out of 5 stars a campus security officer who needs a sturdy phone. The most rugged smartphone I have seen.. 5.0 out of 5 stars Virtually damage proof. very happy after several mos of use. Battery lasts 2 full days Charges overnight. Bought a stick on glass screen protector. 5.0 out of 5 stars very happy after several mos of use. Nice phone, everything worked except receiving calls. This was on T-Mobile in the U.S. and there were no issues with the other 4 phones on my account.. 1.0 out of 5 stars Would not receive calls at all on T-Mobile in the U.S.. We are older in our 70's and do not use a phone as most younger people do. But we are very pleased with robust nature and great performance of this phone, I bought it for my wife... 5.0 out of 5 stars Value for price A+. I got this phone for my son as Christmas present. Went with this particular one cuz seemed like it would be a good sturdy phone. 1.0 out of 5 stars Junk!! Stopped working after 40 days.

BLU Tank Xtreme Pro The easiest way to keep your BLU Tank Xtreme Pro safe against chafes, dirt, dust, grime and everyday wear damage is by using an IQ Shield protector. Each protector is precisely designed for your BLU Tank Xtreme Pro to make certain that all of the required openings are incorporated to keep your device fully operational. The high quality protective film also features a protective UV layer that prevents the protector from turning yellow, allowing it to remain crystal clear. Each protector is invisible to the naked eye and the smooth surface makes it give the impression as if no protector is installed. Each protector can be easily installed and removed just as easily without ever leaving any residue or marks that will damage your device. Included with every IQ Shield protector pack for the BLU Tank Xtreme Pro is an installation squeegee, a microfiber cleansing cloth, a protector for your device, and a set of detailed instructions to assist you through your installation. All IQ Shield protectors are backed by a lifetime warranty that will replace your protector free of charge should it ever wear or need to be replaced..
