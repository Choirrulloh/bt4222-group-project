Share your thoughts with other customers. There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Live tile is awesome, camera is awesome, system is FAST. I used to own a Galaxy Note I since its release, was happy with its size and the abundant apps but for the past 6 month I started to feel the pain for Android's lousy and slow software. The LTE can also suck all the power from a fresh charge in 6~8 hours, so I had to turn off ATT data network anywhere I can use WIFI. Last Friday I finally jumped to Lumia 1520. Now it has been 3 days and I can't express how happy I am! Here are few things I feel great about this phone: 1. The system is fast and smooth - hardly feel delay when switch apps. Integration with Office makes open email attachment so convenient and productive 3. Photos took by the camera are crispy clear and I have not tried to adjust the settings yet. Live tile, man, I love live tile. With a 6 inch screen and adjustable tile size, all my calendar appointments, the weather, the battery usage, the news app I installed, all dynamically displays like music. A quick glance and I know what is going on and what I will up to, no app launch is needed! 5. The voice enabled Nokia GPS drive is accurate, clear and LOUD, it will retire all your GPS device forever. If you use Skydrive, the integration with Skydrive is really smooth and seamless. Battery performance is exceeding my expectation. With LTE or WIFI (I even don't know which I am using now), after a relatively heavy 2~3 hour web usage and a full day random use, I can still have 50% power left by the end of the day. Now are few things I don't feel great about: 1. I really want to have the App/function to automatically mute my phone in working/sleeping hours but seems it is not supported on Windows phone 2. The phone is big as we know, so one hand dial is virtually impossible. If you are driving, even pick up the call will be a problem with one hand(I know, I know, don't drive and .....) 3. I still wish I can have those missed Apps I had on Android, comparing those app I installed on Galaxy Note (about 20 of them), I found all my apps in Windows Phone App store except 3 are not available. btw, anyone want to jump to windows phone, you can check here for available windows phone apps: [...] then you can decide if some critical Apps are missing when you switch the ship.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Former iLover. I am a huge apple fan, I have had every iPhone up until the iphone4 and was in the market for an upgrade A few reasons i picked this over latest iPhone 1) the iPhone is too darn small, sorry it's really a good thing to carry but when you use it for web browsing and lots of email it gets hard to read as i get older 2) the iPhone is more money 3) i'm bored with IOS, i get that if it isn't broke don't fix it but cmon apple !! and when are you gonna have unified ui across all platforms Ok, so now about this phone, it's HUGE !!! don't complain about it folks the measurements are in product description The build quality is very nice , screen is high enough resolution for pictures and videos to look nice and glare isn't too bad I like having removable storage (microsd) and standard microusb plugs for charging The button layout is a bit of an issue, you have to watch where you grab the phone or else you adjust power/volume , etc The camera is where this phone shines, the pictures are beautiful , I am very pleased with it I haven't installed many apps yet, heck office works natively and i like being able to customize all the tiles where I want them Bottom line is it's worth $100 all day long and I'm glad to upgrade. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars THE windows phone to buy. Nokia has been building great phones for an eternity and this device continues Nokia's leadership in excellent quality devices. I've had the 920 and the 925 recently, and I was expecting this phone to be at least on par with the other two but I was not expecting it to be leaps and bounds ahead. Visually, the device is similar to the 920 in design. Larger, thinner, and far more powerful. For those who are appcentric, make certain that apps you use everyday are on this platform before you switch. Once you've decided that excellent telephony trumps apps, it's a no brainer. The 1520 brings top of the line specs to the table whether you're looking for resolution, screen size, expandability, performance, or longevity. My average battery life is 32 hours. the downside is the dialer, it's massive and often requires two hands to dial. The work around is to use live tiles, or to use bluetooth or voice control dialing which is superb.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great Phone with no Future. I purchased this phone from a third party Amazon retailer as used. The retailer was honest about the phone and described what was good about it and what was not so good about it. I purchased a replacement rear camera lens that was previously broken and identified by the seller. I was able to upgrade the phone to a newer version of Windows Phone and am very happy with it. I have owned this Nokia Lumina 1520 for several months now and like everything about it that it is NOT. Mainly it is NOT an Apple iPhone which is what this Nokia Replaced, and yes, I just slid my AT&T sim card out of my iPhone and into the Nokia. Works perfectly and was able to move my contacts easily from my old phone to this one. The Nokia 1520 is a big phone, more like a phablet than a phone. This smartphone is not for everyone's taste as it is large, somewhat cumbersome, but takes awesome pictures and video. I feel more comfortable with the Windows interface rather than Apple. Apple makes a great phone but I really got tired of the hype and how much I needed the bleeding edge of their technology, so I got off the train and went to Nokia. Now that Nokia has sold their phone business to Microsoft, I may have a different opinion with the next generation of Surface Phone or whatever they are going to call it. I may keep what I have for a few more years and not upgrade at all, I am that happy with it now.. Was this review helpful to you?. The phone was a good buy and the condition as seller described it. Love Win-OS and wish they'd make more phones... nobody ya know Top Contributor: Photography. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent!. I have four of these phones. The first one I bought new, but dropped the poor thing and the screen gradually went black and unusable. 5.0 out of 5 stars Do not upgrade to windows 10, it will mess it up totally!. 1.0 out of 5 stars One Star.

The Good Nokia's Lumia 1520 delivers a large, glare-fighting screen, a fast processor, plenty of storage, and a strong 20-megapixel camera for the same on-contract price as a smaller premium phone.. The Bad Its size makes one-handed operation difficult, and call quality was muddier than on most Nokia phones. Limited voice dictation and voice assistance in the OS hobbles its usefulness as a phablet.. The Bottom Line Though it lacks some features found in its big phone rivals, the Nokia Lumia 1520 is a great buy for Windows Phone fans seeking a supersize smartphone with premium hardware.. The 20-megapixel camera barely protrudes from the back. The Nokia Lumia 1520 (center) takes on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (left) and HTC One Max. The Lumia 1520 is too large to comfortably fit into small pockets. The Lumia's 1520 uses Windows Phone's new three-column interface for ultralarge devices. This slim metal tool now opens two doors: the SIM card tray and the microSD card slot. Bigger isn't always better, but in Nokia's case, it is. The 6-inch Lumia 1520 for AT&T is the fastest Windows Phone ever made. Slimmer and lighter than you'd expect for a supersize handset, the 1520 brings home the goods: a huge 1080p HD display, a 20-megapixel camera, and a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor -- the latter a first for Windows Phone.. That high-res camera and outdoor legibility were bright spots. My red model's slippery finish, however, made it too easy to fumble. Some weak points with the platform itself -- like a limited voice assistant and missing TV and movie store -- hobbled the true usefulness of a phone whose screen size cries out for unending visual consumption.. The Lumia 1520's impressive specs and bold design are undoubtedly worth its $200 on-contract price tag for Windows Phone fans. However, if you're aching to milk every last drop of large-screen goodness from a tabletlike handset, then choose from any one of the multiplying Android options, like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 , HTC One Max , and potentially even the curved LG G Flex .. Design and build Nokia's smartphones tend to be chubsters, especially when there's a higher-resolution camera involved, but not so with the 1520.. This colossus is much slimmer and sexier than many a Nokia handset -- a svelte 8.7 millimeters (0.34 inch) compared with the Lumia 1020 's 0.41-inch depth. That's still slightly thicker than the Note 3 (0.33).. At 7.4 ounces, it's significantly heavier than the 5.9-ounce Note 3, but a tad lighter than the One Max (7.7 ounces). It feels hefty in the hand, but not too onerous for a phone of this size. I already carry a heavy purse stuffed with electronics; the 1520 fit right into the jumble.. Nokia's surprisingly slim 6-inch Lumia 1520 (pictures). Amazingly, the 20-megapixel shooter only puckers out from the back panel to form an "O" about the size of a quarter. Nokia switches out the Xenon flash of its Lumia 1020 camera workhorse for a dual LED flash here, partially in an effort to cinch the 1520's waistline.. The 1520 -- which comes in glossy red, matte black, matte white, and matte yellow (we reviewed it in red and black) -- handles well for its size, though the shiny variants are harder to grip, and the slippery device often tumbled from my fingers. Rounded sides and a curved back soften the 1520's sharper corners, making it more comfortable to hold -- though less easy to clamp in place than either the flat-sided One Max, Note 3, and even the 6.4-inch Sony Xperia Z Ultra .. Related Nokia stories Lumia 1520 specs vs. One Max, Note 3 Lumia 1320 a budget phablet DreamWorks' 'Dragon' game reskins Nokia tablet in real time. Proportionally, the 1520 feels tall rather than squat, though the device is still far too massive for my hands and I had to strain my fingers to (try to) perform some tasks one-handed. Of course, my paws are smaller than some, and size is (always) a matter of personal preference. It sticks out halfway from my back pocket, and even more from the front pocket. It did, however, fit better in the front and back pockets of the loose slacks of several men, and I could see it sliding into the internal pocket of a blazer. Likewise, there's plenty of room for a 1520 in a satchel or purse.. Unlike Samsung's Note 3 and 6.3-inch Galaxy Mega , the Lumia 1520 has no software provisions for one-handed operation. That isn't necessarily a bad thing; I'm not convinced that those modifications work terribly well anyhow. On the other hand, the 1520's touch-sensitive targets are larger, so you'll have a better-than-usual chance of nailing the spot you want. For instance, I was able to effectively scroll through information-rich Web sites like Wikipedia with my thumb on the very edge of the display.. As for the materials, Nokia sticks with its signature polycarbonate unibody design, adding a microSD card door to the nano-SIM card door, both of which are flush with the left spine. This slot, which you open with a tool that comes in the box (or an earring back, in a pinch), puts the 1520 on par with the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and HTC One Max -- all three have 32GB of internal storage, and can accept up to 64GB more. The SIM card tray is awkwardly positioned upside-down, which means it could fall out if you're not careful.. You'll find the headset jack on the top rim, a Micro-USB charging port down below, and the power/lock, volume, and camera shutter buttons on the right spine. Nokia proudly points out that the 1520 houses four microphones, one for the top and bottom of each side, to control noise if you do happen to hold the alarmingly large handset to your ear.. Although there's just one speaker on the back, music from Pandora, games, and Nokia Music Mix and YouTube videos streamed out loudly and clearly. Movie previews from Flixster sounded thicker and more garbled, which I suspect was more of an issue with Flixster's files than with the phone's ability to play them.. Screen quality Most of the phone's chassis is taken up by its 6-inch 1080p HD LCD screen, which made the Windows Phone start screen pop.. Colors look bright and edges crisp on the Lumia 1520's screen, which has a pixel density of 367ppi. The One Max and Note 3, with their slightly smaller screens, do pack in more pixels, but the difference is hardly noticeable.. Nokia always wins my appreciation for its work on ratcheting down screen reflectance with a polarizing filter called ClearBlack Display. Not only is it intended to fight glare in direct sunlight -- which makes screens easier to read -- it also helps keep light bounceback in check indoors. With the sunlight readability setting on (relax, it's default), the Lumia 1520 automatically adjusts when it registers bright rays, and backs off when you go back inside. This makes a big difference when you're relying on your phone to read directions or reference a Web site while you're walking outside.. Indeed, with all three phones on both automatic settings and maximum brightness settings, the Lumia 1520 was the easiest of the trio to read outside in the direct noonday sun. Colors were punchier, text looked sharper (and also rendered larger), and glare was easier to dodge. If you're a fan of a different color tone, you can adjust the phone's color profile in the settings.. Thanks to its sensitive screen, you can operate the phone with (most) gloves or with a fingernail.. OS and features Along with the midlevel Nokia Lumia 1320 , the Lumia 1520 is the first to ship Microsoft's slightly updated OS, imaginatively called Windows Phone 8 Update 3. The main thing you need to know is that this tweak introduces a three-column view for device screens measuring 6 inches and above.. This layout fits naturally on the 1520, not toylike as it could have looked if Microsoft had just opted to increase the size of its already large live tiles. The three-column view has the bonus of bringing more icons to the screen, which means less scrolling for you, especially if you make use of the smallest tiles. You'll also find that more e-mails and gallery photos fill the screen, another fringe benefit of upsizing.. Windows Phone gives you standard calendar and alarm tools, Xbox gaming tie-ins, podcasts, and the mobile version of the Microsoft Office suite. Also included is 7GB of Skydrive cloud storage. Multitasking, multiple inboxes, integrated social sharing, music identification, and a barcode scanner are also woven into the Windows Phone platform.. Perhaps more important than what's there is what's missing. Microsoft's outdated TellMe software can open any installed app, make calls, send a text, and search the weather (among other things,) but it lacks the kind of deeply-integrated natural language engine powering Apple's Siri and Google's Voice Actions (commonly called Google Now).. Microsoft is hard at work on Cortana , its belated answer to these two, but that doesn't help the 1520. Unlike iOS and Android, you can't specifically search for much, and the phone sure won't read out answers to you. You can't even dictate text into messages using a keyboard toggle; it doesn't exist. For a phone as large and sometimes hard to hold as the 1520, voice dictation integrated into every keyboard (not just e-mail and text composition) is something I yearned for throughout my testing period.. Also conspicuously absent is a native Microsoft store for buying and renting TV shows and movies, a shame since the 1520's 6-inch screen is primed for extended video playback. Of course, there are plenty of third-party ways to get content: Hulu+, Netflix, Vevo, Vimeo, YouTube, and Crackle, for example, plus AT&T's aforementioned U-Verse Mobile TV service. But don't let those distract you from Microsoft's missed opportunity in closing the loop itself.. As for preloaded apps, a plethora from AT&T, Nokia, and Microsoft and their partners awaits -- like Nokia Music and Here Maps, AT&T's subscription Mobile TV ($10 per month), and Bing Finance and Weather, to name just a few. The Vine video snippet creation app, Yellow Pages Mobile, and Zinio are other examples of partner installations.. Seek out Nokia's many branded apps, and you'll find a new one that the company is pushing hard. Called Nokia Storyteller, this optional app (whose shortcut is preloaded by default) essentially mashes up your photo gallery with geotagging to create a timeline of your happenings which you can follow on a map.. The interface looks clean, and I love the idea of Nokia software intelligently using metadata to cluster together photos by theme (yes, you can edit them if the groupings are wrong). Over time, and travels outside your home city, it promises a more comprehensive way to tell family and friends about recent trips, especially since the app uses Nokia's Here mapping software to pull in nearby businesses and landmarks.. At these early stages, it just isn't clear if Storyteller is a pretty but minimally useful addition, or a feature that people will learn to use. Folks who prefer a spatial reference to locations (like my dad, who endearingly interrupts stories to ask for cross streets), are likely to get the most excited.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

GSMArena's review of Nokia Lumia 1520 great battery and performance. The Nokia Lumia 1520 was a flagship Windows Phone phablet smartphone designed and produced by Finnish telecommunications manufacturer Nokia in partnership with American software manufacturer Microsoft. The device was first announced at the Nokia World event on 22 October 2013 in Abu Dhabi , alongside its mid-range phablet stablemate the Nokia Lumia 1320 and Nokia's 10.1 inch Windows RT tablet the Nokia Lumia 2520. [4] [5] Until its discontinuation in the United States on 7 April 2015 the phone served as the flagship device for Nokia's Lumia Series and Microsoft's mobile effort. On 6 October 2015 Microsoft officially announced its flagship phablet successor, the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL , with availability sometime in November 2015.. The device was powered by a 2.2. GHz quad-core MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 system-on-chip with an ARM-based Krait 400 CPU produced by American semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm. It was paired with 2GB of RAM and an AMD Adreno 330 GPU. The chassis was constructed of a highly durable polycarbonate unibody shell featuring the Lumia Series' signature bright colors. International units were available in black, white, red and yellow with a native storage capacity of 32GB expandable through a MicroSD card slot that can support up to 128GB. The American version was sold exclusively through telecommunications provider AT&T who limited onboard storage to 16GB but offered an exclusive green color alongside the international colors.. The screen of the 1520 was an optically-bonded Full HD ( 1080p ) IPS display with 16 million colors featuring Nokia's proprietary ClearBlack display technology. cm) diagonal with a 16:9 aspect ratio , resulting in a pixel density of 367 ppi. Protection came from a sheet of chemically strengthened Corning Gorilla Glass 2. The device shipped with Windows Phone 8 preinstalled and was upgradable to Windows Phone 8.1 Now this device is included on the Microsoft list of Windows 10 Mobile upgrade, it can be upgraded through the Windows Insider program too. The phone had a large non-removable 3400 mAh Li-Ion battery (BV-4BW), which gave it slightly longer endurance compared to its contemporaries from Android and iOS .. Owing to its large dimensions and flagship specifications, the phone was viewed as a direct competitor to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and HTC One Max. The Lumia 1520 was initially released in Singapore, Hong Kong, the United States, France, China, Germany, Finland, Pakistan and India. In Australia, the Lumia 1520 was distributed exclusively through launch partner Harvey Norman. [7] [8] In the United States, AT&T was chosen as the sole carrier for the device. [9] Production of the Lumia 1520 has been officially discontinued.. The Lumia 1520's IPS LCD [10] display is the first Windows Phone display to have a resolution of 1080p, allowing it to have three columns of Live Tiles and is covered with by Gorilla Glass 2. At 6 inch, the display has a pixel density of 368 pixels per inch. [11] [12] The phone has a 2.2. GHz Snapdragon 800 SoC , and a 20 megapixel PureView camera. [6] [13] It has 4G LTE and near field communication connectivity, and comes with 32. GB of built-in memory, with a possible further 128 GB expansion via microSD. [11] The Lumia 1520 has a 3,400 mAh battery and will be compatible with a US$99 DC-50 wireless-charging plate, [11] with the phone itself to have a price of US$749. Like the Lumia 1020 it takes a shareable 5Mpx picture and a 16Mpx picture that can only be accessed by attaching the handset into a PC, [14] but only has 1/2.5" sensor size. Capable of 2x data binning lossless compression for taking photos and 4x for taking videos. ^ The RM-940 sold by AT&T does not ship with AWS HSPA+ connectivity support out of the box, but it can be obtained by using the official Lumia Denim update.. Tom Warren from The Verge has praised the phone for its display, speed and camera, but noted the lack of stylus support and its size makes it difficult to use one handed. Andy Vandervell from TrustedReviews wrote: "The Lumia 1520 is a watershed phone in many respects. It brings Windows Phone hardware on par with the rest of the smartphone world, but the software still needs a bit of work." [17]. Brad Molen from Engadget concludes: "The Lumia 1520 offers a Windows Phone experience unlike any we've seen before. With its top-notch hardware, fantastic imaging and constantly improving firmware, this is by far our favorite WP8 device." [18]. The Nokia Lumia 1520 won the GSM Arena's Smartphone Champions League in 2013. Nokia captured the first 3 places with the Nokia Lumia 1020 in second place and the Nokia Lumia 520 tied for third with the LG Nexus 5. Upon its release, the 1520 suffered from initial issues that had since been resolved. For example, early users reported a speaker overdrive issue with Windows Phone 8.1 version 5001. [20] Users also reported random reboot issues, which Microsoft tried to address with a software update on 19 March 2014 to no avail but were able to resolve with an update on 19 June 2015. One contentious issue was a supposed design flaw on the device's screen wherein the touch interface digitizer receives signals without user interaction on the touchscreen, resulting in "phantom touches".

The news on the web is that T-Mobile is not interested in getting the new Nokia line up, specifically the Lumia 1520.. I am a recent convert to T-Mobile from AT&T and was expecting that Lumia 925 might have a successor and it would be the Lumia 1520.. Someone else asked the same question to the Moderators and their reply was the usual, "we are listening to you" which means that they seem not to care.. I want to start a petition or movement to get T-Mobile fired up about this device.. Its the best Windows Phone yet and possibly the last of Nokia.. I don't understand why T-Mobile would not think this phone wouldn't sell.. The Lumia 521 is selling like hot cakes and I usnderstand the price is an issue, but T-Mobile does a better job with their payment program than the other idiot, AT&T.. Look at the sales of Samsung Note 3, its doing much better than the Note 2.. Maybe T-Mobile is looking for customers who just care about the cheaper services plans than phones.. Its just frustrating to see the second GSM carrier not to stock the latest Windows Phones.. And this is my personal opinion and I am sure many of you will agree that this OS is better and smoother than Android or iOS (I have used them both since 1st gen iPhone and Samsung Galaxy).. Lets get after T-Mobile and get them to stock the Lumia 1520.. This content has been marked as final.. Show 37 replies. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to konfuesious ). Select the Nokia Lumina 1520 with the " no contract " option.. Select the Nokia Lumina 1520. The Unlocked version makes sense to order, but I am unclear if it is the U.S. GSM version, RM-893 , using LTE bands .... Both options require you to get the phone unlocked by AT&T.. Like Show 1 Likes (1). ( in response to emancipated ). I understand the solutions, but getting an unlocked phone does not give you the full T-Mobile experience.. Like for example, the customer service probably will not help beyond their scope because the phone was bought outside of their network, MMS and APN needs to be changed manually and most of the time you have to do it more than once, no WIFI calling app on unlocked phones.. These are just some of the issues with bringing unlocked phones to a carrier.. What I want is a complete satisfactory experience from T-Mobile.. At the moment I am using the Lumia 521 and I love it, but its slow and some of the apps don't work on it since its not Windows 8.. I am just saying that they (T-Mobile) does not need to buy millions of units, just order or preorder a small amount and see what the demand is like, obviously the demand is high on AT&T since they already ran out of stock in store and online, and some of the preorders were back ordered as well.. Thank you for your time though.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to konfuesious ). Lumia 521 does run the Windows Phone 8 operating system, just like the Lumia 1520. Some apps might not be compatible with the 521 due to hardware differences between it and some of the other WP8 devices: lower RAM, no front facing camera, lower screen resolution, no NFC capability.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to sneakymoose ). you are absolutely correct and i am wrong, I apologize.. Lumia 521 does run OS 8.0.. But you definitely hit the nail on its head, not having those options makes a the Windows Phone experience not a thorough one.. Its like using those cheap android handsets as a PAYG service.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to konfuesious ). Short of wifi calling, the AT&T Lumia 1520 seems to provide everything else - but I never had wifi calling before on T-Mobile anyway - they don't seem to provide it for every phone.. Follow this link for instructions on how to bring the 1520 on to the T-Mobile network:. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to squibcake5 ). T-Mobile has provided wi-fi calling for every OS that supported it since it has to be embedded in the OS.. Android was of course the first then BB and Windows with Apple the last to recently join the parade.. The only other phones that they sold were the Nexus devices which were "pure" versions so it couldn't be embedded in the OS because that would negate the "pure" status although it seems now that Google is going to embed it like Apple did for use by the carriers that support it and will just not be used by those that don't in a later version of Lollipop due out sometime early next year.. One thing that most people I don't think realize is that the carriers don't always get a choice of which phone they carry.. They may want to carry a device but the manufacturer either because of an exclusive deal they got money for or they just don't think the carrier can sell enough to make the custom carrier programming or hardware requirements worth the effort so they won't even offer it to the carrier to sell.. Yes the carrier sometimes decides it is not worth the cost associated caring a particular product line but it is also the other way around and frankly we will never know who it was..

The 521 and 925 both got it with the same OS.. The 810 met all hardware and software requirements but, likely, did have the subscriber base to make it worth it.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to konfuesious ). Nokia and AT&T negotiated an exclusive deal for AT&T to sell the Nokia Lumia 1520.. It wasn't a situation where T-Mobile was "not interested" in carrying the Lumia 1520.. I sincerely doubt that T-Mobile is willing and able to beat the amount of money that AT&T will put down for the exclusive rights for the phone.. The Lumia 1520 wouldn't be considered a successor to the Lumia 925.. It is in a separate class of devices, much like the Lumia 1020 is.. The successor to the Lumia 925 will probably also have a model number that starts with '9'.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to 21stnow ). I understand that is not a successor to the 925.. The whole point of my original post was to gauge interest for the Lumia 1520, which I know exists more than what I see on the forums and also to let T-Mobile know that there are niche customers that would like to purchase and use a 1520 on T-Mobile or a variant.. I understand that T-Mobile is not as loaded as $t&T but they got the Lumia 925 didn't they?. I am sure they can work out a deal for the 1520 variant.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to konfuesious ). The Lumia 925 was never an exclusive device.. Comparing those phone releases to each other is comparing apples and oranges-they're not the same.. Realistically, the demand for the Lumia 1520 isn't that high.. Looking at the interest that I see in the Lumia 1520 forums on WP Central and considering that the forums have a worldwide audience, I doubt that the number of T-Mobile US customers that are interested in the device numbers in the six-figures.. I wish for Nokia's sake that it were different (I'm a stockholder), but the large phone market is lead by Samsung's Note series at the moment.. The Lumia 1520 does nothing to threaten Samsung's position there.. Sony is a bigger threat than Nokia is.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to konfuesious ). I have been perusing this forum trying to gauge interest in the 1520, so heres the deal. Negri Electronics sells the AT&T variant which has the 1700 AWS bands, both LTE and 3G. Maybe this was Nokia getting around the exclusivity by including the AWS bands. Only drawback is that they are locked. I will most likely call AT&T and see if they will unlock the phone. Good thing is per their website, if it is paid in full they WILL unlock the phone, which usually takes 48 hrs but could run up to 5 days. Just hit up Negri's website, they cost 630 bucks and come in yellow, red, black, and white colors. i'll be getting one on the 15th!. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to viper1970 ). AT&T probably won't unlock it until six months after the release date because it is an exclusive device.. You also have to be a current AT&T customer or a past AT&T customer with an account number in order for them to unlock the device.. Like Show 1 Likes (1). ( in response to 21stnow ). " AT&T probably won't unlock it until six months after the release date because it is an exclusive device".. 11/26/13 17:59 hr pst unlock request, case number. 11/27/13 11:51 hr pst unlock code received. 26th the AT&T person gave me the case number.. She suggested AT&T may respond by Wednesday December 4th.. 27th AT&T email arrived with the unlock code.. The government requirement is that "subsidized devices" be paid off in full before an unlock code is provided.. The Nokia Lumia 1520 is a nice++ device.. Like Show 0 Likes (0).

That was also in line with the experience that I had with the Lumia 900.. Like Show 1 Likes (1). ( in response to 21stnow ). Maybe it was the AT&T online Chat Session.

I mean is it stable? does it support 4G LTE with T-Mobile?. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to utimatios ). Yes it connect to LTE without any issues, I didn't like that AT&T block you from turning the LTE off.. You'll have to add the T-Mobile apn. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to cyco1978 ). Nice, just couple more questions .. I didn't understand what you meant by "turning the LTE off" .. and how can I add T-Mobile APN to the phone?. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to utimatios ). Because it's and att phone and they pretty much cripple all there phone. Your unable to go into cellular setting & turn LTE off like I could on my 925 (T-Mobile). Your going to have to add the APN for T-Mobile and the MMS APN.. I can't tell you which window that is at the moment I've broken my phone. But it should be in cellular.. Once the phones unlocked you'll see add APN for both. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to utimatios ). Yes, it's always been a t-moblie phone , I think he is trying to trick you guys.

I left Verizon three years ago for T-Mobile because "V" wasn't interested in Windows Phone.. It seems T-Mobile is losing their interest and AT&T is pushing the envelope.. It's peculiar when you visit a T-Mobile store that all the employees are using the Galaxy Note because of its size, but T-Mobile won't embrace the "phablet" on all platforms.. I don't need a phone with a million apps, I just want one with business reliability and the Windows Phone 8 accomplishes this, but I want a phone with a display larger than 4.5".. T-Mobile needs to wake up to the fact that they need to offer a little variety in their hardware on all platforms except Apple.. Those users are quite content with a phone that's hardware changes very little from generation to generation.. I wasn't thrilled with Nokia, but I have to admit the 925 is a very nice piece of hardware with some slick built-in apps.. I'm just looking for its bigger brother.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to wildrisc ). Starting in July of 2013 I have been going to my local neighborhood T-Mobile store because I was curious about the windows platform and also wanted to play with the 925.. I would go atleast once every two weeks and I too noticed that all the sales associates would have a Samsung brand phone, which I don't care but I would see the Nokia display empty everytime.. Meaning all the customers that were there were either looking at the upcoming or already there iphone or the android platform.. I would stand there for about 10 mins or so and play with the device and not one time an employee has come up to me and asked "may i help you with anything or did you have a question about this phone?". Its only when I would ponder around the android platform or am about to walk out they would say something.. Its truly sad because I did my research for the phone and the service before I switched from AT&T this November and I love their service don't get me wrong but lack of higher end Windows phone (which I prefer over iOS and Android) would make me go back or go prepaid on AT&T.. Like Show 1 Likes (1). ( in response to konfuesious ). Im not sure who's fault it is that T Mobile does not carry the Nokia Lumia 1520 but someone dropped the ball here and this phone makes me want to switch to AT&T. Its a shame we are in the age of unlimited technology capabilities with an unlimited GSM network company but we are not able to use the best phone out there on the market right now. How many people use OfficeSuite Pro 7 (not OfficeMobile which is made by MS Office)? Apparently 15 million. If T-Mobile invested in making sure they had the top phones and Tablets exclusively for Microsoft Users, then it would be wise to grab Nokia's attention in any way possible for that reason only, not to mention it is the best phone out there. If T-mobile hasnt noticed yet, the mobile market is going for investing in phablet designs, T-Mobile just missed out on taking advantage of this during a prime time of 2014. As a t-mobile customer I am pretty disappointed.. Like Show 2 Likes (2).

Wanted to resurrect and old thread.. I love the 1520 and abhor At&T. (I've had them at work since 2006 and currently suffer with my Blackberry z10.). Is there any idea if/when TMO will get the 1520? I like my Note 2 but really enjoy the Windows phone UI, plus all my staff use C# for development.. However, the 920 is way too small.. Like Show 1 Likes (1). ( in response to konfuesious ). I'm leaving T-Mobile specifically because they're not carrying the 1520. I've been a customer of theirs for 9 years. Fourteen months ago, I got talked into purchasing the Nokia Lumia 810, and I LOVE it! But now I want something bigger, and T-mobile's silence on the 1520 or any new similar Nokia phones has forced me to jump ship. I've scoured the tech sites and T-mobile's forums for any reason to stay, I've also asked in their retail locations about new Nokia phones. So, onward to AT&T where I can finally get my 1520.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to konfuesious ). The 1520.3 is available from newegg.com.. I has full Tmo band support, Qi charging and the full 32 GB storage..

I thought about ordering that one but I currently have an unlocked rogers lumia 920 and had to spend lots of time getting MMS working.. Also, it doesn't have WiFi calling, doesn't get alerts for sever weather, amber alerts, etc.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to saleawy ). MMS is only a problem on carrier branded phones.. I've had zero problems using an unlocked 720 on T-Mobile.. For unlocked ATT branded phones, you just have to edit the MMS APN...takes 2 minutes.. Yes, if you need WiFi calling, I would suggest a CellFi device from T-Mobile.. If you complain about service in your house, you can get one for free.. If you need it often outside the house, I'd suggest a different carrier because the WiFi calling app on WP is kinda crappy.. Severe weather alerts can come from any weather app of your choosing.. Of course there will be some sacrifices.. But not having to wait on T-mobile to get your OS and firmware updates would definitely make it worthwhile, IMO.. Carrier branded devices are not your friend.. I wish T-Mobile would drop carrier branding altogether and do what the rest of the world is doing.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to konfuesious ). jgbstetson you make a good argument and I think unbranded phones may be the way to go.. Most phones have emergency alerts built in for severe weather, natural disasters, amber alerts, etc. and you don't need to rely on an app.. Those alerts don't work on my Rogers 920 because it's a Canadian phone and seems to be missing the option completely.. If you go to Settings > Applications>Messaging, and scroll to the bottom you should see an option for "emergency alerts".. I wonder if the unbranded phones have the option, can you check?. That's s nice feature but no a deal breaker for me so I do plan to order an unbranded 1520.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to saleawy ). This is to confirm: The unlocked Latin American version that B&H sell (1520.3 AKA RM-938) fully supports T-Mobile, including both 4G LTE data and MMS. Got it a couple of days ago, had to "downsize" the Micro-SIM card to a Nano-Mobile store.. The phone immediately created an APN on its own and started fully supporting 4G LTE data and MMS messages without any additional APN editing. (This did not happen with my AT&T LG E980 that required APN for both data and MMS to be created manually.). Just in case: APN functionalityMobile APN was created automatically and is not editable. You can create you own APN if you need to, both Data and MMS options are available.. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to leonidg ). That's good to know that you have the phone working with out much trouble on T-Mobile.. The main thing that's missing is WiFi calling otherwise I would of ordered the 1520 by now.. Anyone know if it or another high end lumia will come to t-mobile soon?. Like Show 0 Likes (0). ( in response to konfuesious ). Not sure if you are still looking for an answer on this, but I have one. Back in July Nokia released a 1520.3 variant for Argentina. This variant just to happens to use T-Mobiles LTE bands. It only came in one color (black). I bought this on newegg.com for just under $500.. When it arrived I popped in a nano sim I had to buy for $10 on T-Mobile and had my number moved over from my Nokia 925. After changing the language to English and did all of the updates and got Preview Dev installed and did all of its updates, I was up and running on WP 8.1.1. (I'm getting about 20MB down here in Chicago). The only feature that will not be available with this variant is WiFi Calling. If you are on an unlimited plan, this should be a non-issue.. So long story short, while its not a "T-Mobile Version", it will work on T-Mobile. Again pop over to new egg and look for the variant 1520.3 (again pay attention and make sure you get that .3 )..

By Praful Yadav | 5 May 2014. First of all guys please stop cribbing about windows phone app collection. It has all the necessary apps and more are being added on a daily basis. Yes WP still has some catching up to do but it is getting there fast.. For those who feel Windows Phone Operating System is not matured, If you feel so then you have not used a windows phone in person, you are those people who just watch few YouTube videos or so called reviews. The OS is silky smooth and everything is though out well, everything is simple and elegant. The live tiles are beautiful and yes you tend to get bored of the limited collection of accent colours but this will change soon with the newly announced Windows Phone 8.1 update which provides option to toggle between extra columns of tiles and default tile layout. Also you have an option of setting any image as home screen live tiles background wallpaper which has parallax effect.. Windows Phone 8.1 is bringing tons of features which are par with android OS.. The build quality is stunning; I prefer the matt finish polycarbonate to the glossy finish which was the case with my previous Lumia 920.. Phone is very sleek, though on paper its weight may scare you but in person its not that bad. You will get used it to soon as the weight is uniformly distributed.. The size of the phone will really scare you at first, I have above average sized hands so its manageable but many people may find it quite difficult to handle this phone due to its massive footprint.. I am totally in love with this 6” 1080 x 1920 IPS LCD display. It’s great for media consumption the viewing angle is amazing, sun light readability is the best out there; colours look punchy yet not being overly saturated like AMOLED displays. You do get to play with colour saturation and contrast in display settings as per your taste.. The best part of this phone is its massive 3400 mAh battery coupled with the latest low energy consumption Qualcomm snapdragon 800 chipset. You can easily get through a day of heavy usage. (Refer gsmarena.com for the battery rating: It’s the top phone in the list). The hardware is par with the latest high-end android devices.. Super sensitive touch, inbuilt wireless charging capable, SD card support up to 64 GB (128 GB with WP 8.1 update). The top feature: The 20 MP Carl Zeiss optics with physical optical image stabilization is one of the best you can find in the market (Yes excluding Nokia's own Lumia 1020 which is in a separate league of its own). This device takes some stunning stills and captures amazing videos.. Nokia Camera app is one of the best out there which is simple easy to use with many manual controls which are only found on Professional DSLRs. If you have little knowledge re ISO, Shutter speed, exposure you can take some stunning looking shots. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 7 out of 7 people found this review helpful.

The battery is 3400 mAh and allows you to safely get through the day. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 1 out of 1 people found this review helpful. By Subhash Chand | 1 Jun 2014. I have been using this phone since late last year, I love it. I make my living with the phone and it has not failed me in anyway. The huge screen makes my iphone friends envious. The phone has plenty of space for my music especially since I added a 64 Micro SD card. The zune software made much needed improvements for adding music to the phone ( X box music). Camera is 20 mp and is excellent, the os makes posting pics on FB one click. Battery life lasts the day easily and I have been a windows mobile user for a few years now I am loving the OS more and more as each update comes in. The address book is by far the best I have seen from any os. Its connection with FB makes it quick to get caught up with a persons life and I don't miss birthdays anymore. Great phone that help keeps my world connected.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. Most powerful windows phone in the market !. By dinesh kumar | 31 May 2014. Intro: The Nokia Lumia 1520 is just like the rest of the premium Lumia smartphones we've seen, but bigger and faster. With the Snapdragon 800 making sure the finest experience. PROS: Lumia 1520 is a giant phablet, it packs the most powerful specs with it. By a 6' inch screen it looks most beautiful display in the market. By its ips technology it looks great ,its better than amoled displays.. Nokia is named for best camera in their phones, this giant has that too. this packs 20 mp camera with best low light imaging. and packs with 1.2 mp front camera.. It has Full HD display and 2gb of ram and 3400mAh battery, so it is one of the powerful hardware till date.. Most of them says windows phone has a proper app store , but I think Microsoft had been worked on it , now we have all the essential apps in the store.. CONS: Windows phone UI is the most fresh UI till date. it looks great , but still it is not customized for phablets. The phone is little bigger then all, so it is not liked by all types of people.. And the main thing is price, it priced for about 47K. by this price we can get the more powerful and a multitasking android phones.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. Encounter with a Goliath – Nokia Lumia 1520. By Rahul Radhakrishnan | 2 May 2014. At first glance the Lumia 1520 looks like a magnified Lumia 925 - it has almost same design and build except for it ditches aluminum, with a small camera hump. The 6 inch display fills up your hands and your face. There is nothing much in the front.. The Nokia Lumia 1520 has a 6" IPS LCD screen of 1080p resolution, the pixel density works out to 367ppi. The LCD incorporates Nokia's ClearBlack tech - a set of polarizing filters, which minimize glare. Plus, Gorilla Glass 2 on top for protection.. The 1080p IPS LCD display is one gorgeous display very similar to HTC One’s Super LCD3 display, it has excellent real tone color reproduction unlike Super Amoled , viewing angles are excellently wide with only a minor shift in contrast when going to extremes , adjustable saturation and temperature levels, and you’ve got an outstanding Smartphone display. The front of the phablet is entirely coated with Gorilla Glass 2, which covers the screen, the capacitive keys and front camera. It is powered by 2.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 with 2GB of Ram. It has the latest processor and latest hardware.. Rounding out the superstar spec sheet is the 1520′s storage capacity. In addition to the 32GB of onboard storage, the 1520 also offers a MicroSD card slot for storage expansion up to an additional 64GB – making it the only flagship Nokia device to do so.. Battery life is great with the massive battery of 3,400mAh, light-weight Windows Phone OS and power-efficient display, the Lumia 1520 is well ahead of the other phablets. The phablet also comes with built-in wireless charging. Add in 802.11ac, BT 4.0, and NFC support; and LTE capability (only for US I believe) alongside HSPA+, alongside HSPA+, and you’re looking at the highest-end Windows Phone ever to hit the market.. The 20MP PureView module is optically-stabilized, with six-element Carl Zeiss optics and a 1/2.5 inch sensor with an aperture rating of f/2.4, complimented with a dual-LED flash. It can capture both 5mp oversampled image and 19mp images in one shot,. Lossless digital zoom of 2x is available,. It can capture 1080 videos and RAW DNG images.. It is a huge phone and that itself is a letdown for me. But seeing the sales our local manufacturers are making through phablets, I see lot of people is not like me and they enjoy media consumption with a huge phone. Right now it truly is a match for Samsung Galaxy Note 3 in hardware and sometimes better, but in software departments, Note 3 with its top notch multitasking and cool S-pen features, Lumia is no match for it. But if your idea is to have a huge phablet with Big screen with an awesome camera and you love using phone for multimedia consumption and Microsoft office suite for work, this phone is for you, this phone is for you, if you are a poweruser, nothing beats the Note 3..

Dimensions: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 inches (162.8 x 85.4 x 8.7 mm). Weight: 7.37 oz (209 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 6.0 inches. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor, Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 2), Polarizing filter. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Optical image stabilization, Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Face detection, Digital zoom, Self-timer, Touch to focus, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, Panorama, Effects. 3840x2160 (4K) (30 fps), 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (30 fps), 1280x720 (720p HD) (30 fps). Features: Optical image stabilization, Video light. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 27.40 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 32.0 days (768 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 25.10 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern..

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Nokia built an amazing phone with customized applications and Windows Phone 8 performs flawlessly. Super fast processor, smooth video; you can finally watch a video and listen to it with Bluetooth headphones (mine is Plantronics backbeat 903+). For those skeptical regarding applications, there is Instagram and Whatsapp for W8 (download is free for both) and many more free apps, although Lumia 1520 brings a load of essential applications. Very advisable to buy a cover, not only for its protection but for a better handling. I found the device extremely slippery in my hands. I purchased a cover with kick stand, so I can eat and read or watch a video. W8 automatically backs up most your data (pics, docs and videos) to skydrive, which is very convenient. All contacts I had on my HTC HD7 (Windows phone 7.5) was imported as soon as I register my accounts (Hotmail, Facebook and Google) even without the sim card. A great feature is that you can access your Lumia 1520 from your PC as if it is an external hard drive. You can also receive and send several kinds of files via Bluetooth. The NFC (Near Field Communication) is amazing!! I still donnot understand people who rather pay a lot more for an IPhone or Android!! I also purchased a 32Gb micro SD (you can install up to 64Gb), which is another feature Iphones don't have. You will now have a phone that will keep up with you all day, provided you make a normal use of it. Remember to charge it, use it until battery runs out and charge it again, so that your battery will be optimized. Only disappointment regards to the charger which is European. Although seller sends (at no cost) an American adapter, it gets to be a very clumsy piece (both together). February 6th Update Today I test the Here Nokia (the built in GPS) I turned it on together with my car's GPS, except that I made it work offline. Both GPSs took me from where I was to where I wanted to go flawlessly. The Here Nokia offers more detailed information and precision. I am being amazed day after day by its software.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Review from an AVID iphone user of most models and former Windows 7 Lumia 920. First I will say that windows 8 is AMAZING. I had the Nokia Lumia 920 and likes a lot of the personalization features but it lacked my Pandora, pinterest, myfitnesspal, Spotify, and other apps I use daily so I went back to IPhone. I had the IPhone 4S. I liked a lot about my iphone but was bored. Seems like since Steve Jobs passing...theres nothing awing about new phones 5, 5c and 5s. Same ol Same ol EXCEPT now...a lot of my apps are always crashing. My wifi isn't that strong in my room, my front camera quit...and it's almost the same as the first iPhone. A lot of good changes but not very many customization features for me. BEFORE PURCHASE: I decided to get Nokia Lumia 1520 BECAUSE 1. Supposedly had many of the apps that I previously could not get on my old Nokia 2. More customization with Windows 8 3. Beautiful Big Screen Like a Tablet 4. Amazing Camera by Carl Zeiss 5. Mostly...Side by Side comparison that I did with IPhone 5c, 5s and Lumia 1020. (if you can do this side by side comparison which I did on AT&T...I would do it because it answers a lot of questions and made my decision 100%) 6. Ability to Expand storage with the miniSD port 7. Ability to get phone in yellow. It was a hard decision between yellow and red because they are both beautifully vibrant but I went with yellow because I love the brighter. UNBOXING: Amazed by color brightness, screen brightness, size and beautiful camera. In the first few days I learned a few more awesome things 1. the Lumia now does SnapShot and if you are or have been an iPhone user this is awesome. There is a driving mode you can set up with a Bluetooth device to avoid wrecks. Some of the apps that were previously said not to be on the windows phones were now there. In face the only thing I do not have that I used a lot was weight watchers...they just have a rinkidink calculator but im sure that will update. Apps that I use a lot that are available that on some reviews were said not to be Pinterest Spotify Rdio Instagram Amazon Allrecipes Netflix Pandora MyFitnessPal App folder (to organize all your apps like IPhone) FREE RINGTONES...NO MORE PAYING FOR THAT CRAP KidsCorner Wallet to store credit cards Run the Map Runtastic Vine YouTubeHD I have had this less than a week so I know I will learn more and I will rereview or add to it but my current Conclusion is If you are looking to upgrade and thinking about trying something new...better camera...more customization with out sacrificing simplicity...live tiles...mostly free apps...free ringtones...driving mode...no sacrificing your current apps, free office, ability to back up on skydrive and at&t locker....find your phone...ANNNND SOOO MUCH MORE... Get a CASE! SERIOUSLY This phone is very slippery on the back. You need some kind of protection and grip to prevent dropping it or if you do to help protect from the fall. *Be carefully applying tight cases...do not press hard on display screen because you can easily distort color on display screen* 3. GET A SCREEN PROTECTOR...I recommend armor brand. They have lifetime warranty and less than 10 bucks with amazon free prime shipping. If you want smaller phone..you might try Nokia Lumia 1020...better camera and smaller but lacks some of the specs 1520 has.

Daily Roundup: Nokia 1520 review, Xbox One vs. the PlayStation 4, RAW support for Android and more!. Nokia Lumia 1520 review: the best Windows Phone device yet. AT&T will have exclusive on Nokia 1520 in the US, will sell the 2520 tablet also (update). Nokia leaks Lumia 1520 details on Chinese online store: 20MP PureView camera, Snapdragon 800 processor. Nokia Lumia 1520 review: the best Windows Phone device yet. Windows Phone has never looked this good. The latest update to Microsoft's mobile operating system, known as Update 3, added support for 1080p displays, large smartphone screens and state-of-the-art processors. And now, these features are finally showing up on actual hardware. The first device to tick off all these boxes is the Nokia Lumia 1520 , a 6-inch flagship with all of the trimmings we've been waiting to see on a Windows Phone device for three years now.. Because high-end Windows Phones have been limited to whatever specs Microsoft officially supports, we've felt that Nokia's flagships didn't differ enough in specs from the lowest-end Lumias to justify the enormous price difference. At least, they didn't until now. The Lumia 1520 is the first top-of-the-line Windows Phone device that brings the best possible components. So, what's WP8 like on hardware that isn't behind the times? Let's find out.. Gallery: Nokia Lumia 1520 | 73 Photos. 6-inch display may be too big for some. The Lumia 1520 offers a Windows Phone experience unlike any we've seen before. With its top-notch hardware, fantastic imaging and constantly improving firmware, this is by far our favorite WP8 device.. The design language of the Nokia Lumia series has changed little since the introduction of the first device, the Lumia 800 , more than two years ago. The 1520 has the same type of build as most other Lumia flagships (one exception being the 925 ), which is to say it's fashioned out of unibody polycarbonate plastic. Just like many of its predecessors, it's an incredibly solid device, and that's even more important with the 1520 than with earlier models.. Why? Because it's a 6-inch beast of a phone, and if you're not careful, you might drop it. At 162.8 x 85.4 x 8.7mm, it's thinner than the 5.9-inch HTC One Max , which makes the 1520 a bit more comfortable to hold. Still, it's wider, taller and a hair thicker than the 5.7-inch Galaxy Note 3 -- not to mention heavier, at 7.27 ounces (206g). Thanks to the 1520's thin, curved sides, you can get a decent grip on the phone simply by wrapping your fingers around the device, but this has an unfortunate side effect. Whereas the Lumia 1020 has rounded edges, the 1520's sides are sharper, making it difficult for the tips of your fingers to actually rest comfortably on them. This is especially troublesome when you're trying to take pictures with the 1520 and you feel like you have nothing to grip when you want a more stable shot.. Our review unit was a white AT&T model, but you can also get it in black, yellow or red. With the exception of the glossy red version, the Lumia 1520 sports a matte finish quite similar to the white Nexus 5. It's smooth on the back and sides and doesn't involve any special material or texture. Again, this is nothing new for Nokia's Lumia phones, but it feels a bit more slippery here because it's less comfortable to hold.. Taking a look at the back of the phone, you'll see the 20-megapixel rear camera atop a hump that looks precisely like the one on the Lumia 925. Above that is a dual-LED flash module and multiple mics. A speaker grille and three silver pogo pins are on the bottom of the back, the latter of which will come in handy for the optional wireless charging cover that you'll be able to buy separately.. Before moving on, let's double back to one particular hardware feature that hasn't received much attention: the multiple mics located just above the camera on the back of the 1520. Nokia's included four microphones for directional stereo recordings. The idea here is to do a better job of capturing sound coming from objects in front of your camera -- people, pets, perhaps a band at a concert -- while rejecting noises picked up from other directions. We'll discuss more about how it fares in the section on video performance.. On the left side, you'll find a microSD reader, supporting cards up to 64GB, as well as a nano-SIM slot (this SIM is the same size as the Moto X and iPhone 5 / 5s , so it's smaller than the standard). To the right is the Lumia-standard trio of volume, power and two-stage camera shutter buttons, all of which are difficult to press because they're nearly flush with the phone's body. There's also a 3.5mm headphone jack on top and a micro-USB port on the bottom.. The usual suite of capacitive Windows Phone navigation keys lines the bottom, while an earpiece, front-facing camera and carrier logo (AT&T in this case) sit up top. From a distance, the glass appears to be draped over the display so that there's no interruption between it and the rest of the phone's body, but upon closer inspection you'll see that there's a small gap between the glass and the polycarbonate.. The gap itself isn't such a big deal, but something else about the glass gave us pause: It's fitted with Gorilla Glass 2, the version of Corning's scratch-resistant glass that came out last year. The Lumia 1020, on the other hand, uses Gorilla Glass 3, which does a considerably better job protecting the screen. While this won't be a dealbreaker for most, we've already noticed various scratches on the corners and edges of the screen, and that's after just a few days of use. Basically, this means that you'll want to avoid putting the device in your pocket or purse alongside pointy items.. At the time of this writing, the Lumia 1520 has only been announced on one US carrier, but it's widely available in other parts of the world. There are three different model numbers, each offering compatibility with different networks. Each variant has quad-band GSM/EDGE (850/900/1800/1900) and at least four HSPA+ bands (850/900/1900/2100), but AT&T's model (the RM-938) comes with a fifth band for AWS, technically making it compatible with T-Mobile's HSPA+ network. Only two of the models come with LTE: the RM-937, which features compatibility with five bands (800/900/1800/2100/2600), and the RM-938, which offers support for a different set of five bands (2, 4, 5, 7, 17). Those mainly serve AT&T and T-Mobile in the US. ( Update: We didn't clearly state another pair of differences on the AT&T version versus the global units. The AT&T option only comes with 16GB internal storage and wireless charging requires an optional cover, whereas the global models are 32GB and have the capability built-in.). High-resolution smartphone displays come a dime a dozen, but this is unchartered territory for Windows Phone devices. Nokia's recent flagships have featured beautiful ClearBlack screens, so we were excited to see that the Lumia 1520 brings a similar panel, just one with more pixels. The Lumia 1520 sports a 6-inch ClearBlack IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080, which means you're looking at a pixel density of 368 pixels per inch. The 1520 still isn't quite as pixel-dense as the Galaxy Note 3, which offers the same resolution in a screen that's 0.3 inch smaller, but let's focus on the actual quality rather than minuscule differences in pixel density.. To cut straight to the point, we love the 1520's display. It offers vibrant colors for an LCD and has brighter whites than the AMOLED panel on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, although its darker shades aren't quite as deep. The viewing angles are better than on almost every other phone. In fact, even if we weren't impressed by anything else on the display, we'd still rave about how easy it is to ready in direct sunlight.. Still, what if your eyes have completely different color preferences from ours? Perhaps you're a fan of warmer displays and hold colder ones in complete disdain, or maybe you simply can't stand colors so saturated that they look cartoony. It's cases like these where the high-end Lumias come with a competitive advantage: You can actually adjust the color profile yourself by changing both the temperature and saturation. As it happens, we rarely felt the need to make any adjustments, but it's worth noting there aren't many smartphones offering this option. As an aside, the 1520's capacitive touchscreen is also sensitive enough that you can use it with gloves on, but this has been included on the last few Lumias and is nothing new with the 1520.. With each new generation of Windows Phone, the OS becomes more and more enticing. An increasing number of major developers are now starting to give WP8 a closer look, and as a result, the ecosystem is starting to feel more mature. Companies that were once hesitant to pour resources into Microsoft's OS are now jumping on board: Pandora, Instagram, Vine, Path, Tumblr and many other heavy hitters now either have apps in the Windows Phone Store or have at least committed to releasing something in the near future.. In addition to offering support for 1080p displays, larger smartphone screens and Snapdragon 800 chipsets, the third update to Windows Phone 8 came with a few software enhancements as well. Included in the list of new features is Driving Mode, which keeps distractions to a minimum while you're on the road. The update also brings the ability to lock screen orientation, as well as assign ringtones to text messages and other notifications. You can also tap on an open app in the app switcher to get rid of programs running in the background.. As a way of doing its part to grow the Windows Phone ecosystem, Nokia bundles together its own software and firmware updates alongside Microsoft's and then rolls them out to several Lumia models. (Nokia's Amber update, for instance, was first seen on the Lumia 1020 earlier this summer and rolled out to other Lumias afterward.) The latest package, which comes pre-installed on the Lumia 1520, is called the Black update.. Gallery: Nokia Lumia 1520 sample screenshots | 51 Photos. Camera Nokia Camera and Refocus Lens Imaging Performance. What's unique about this particular refresh? It builds on the Amber update with several new features, many of which can be found on the Glance screen. As you may recall, this screen lets users check the time when the display is turned off, but that's about it. With Black, you'll now have access to the same notifications that are found on the lock screen, as well as custom text and calendar info, pedometer support and red, green and blue color options while the screen is in Night mode. The new hues are extremely subtle so they shouldn't be distracting (that would, of course, defeat the purpose of Night mode).. Outside of Glance, Black also delivers a few more imaging features, including the Refocus Lens, support for the RAW picture format in the 1020 and 1520 and a few new camera algorithms for tone mapping and noise reduction on the 1020. But wait, there's more: The Black update also ensures that all Lumia devices can get the new Nokia Camera, which combines the Pro Cam and Smart Cam apps. We'll go into much more detail on these new imaging features in the next section.. Finally, the update also brings support for Bluetooth 4.0 LE -- a feature that's becoming increasingly common in fitness trackers like the Nike FuelBand SE and the Jawbone Up24. Additionally, the update adds another new app called Nokia Beamer, which "beams" multimedia from your phone to your TV, laptop or other smartphones. It's not a new concept in the mobile world, but we'll happily welcome more opportunities to share stuff to other devices.. Another new feature is Storyteller, which is being introduced on both the 1520 and the 2520. Basically it's a clever interface that takes your geotagged photos and lets you group them into collections called "stories." If you like, you can group them by location, date or event -- it's up to you how to present them. Additionally, you can split stories up, merge them together or separate each individual photo. It's a nice feature, but it's nothing more than a fancy photo album viewer that may confuse users who are accustomed to the standard Windows Phone viewer.. One positive side effect of using a Windows Phone with such a large screen is a much more pleasant typing experience. It's true that we've been spoiled over the last couple of years by fancy third-party Android keyboards capable of swipe gestures and word predictions, but we've always enjoyed the Windows Phone keyboard thanks to its ease of use, larger keys and smart autocorrection. On a 6-inch display, that same keyboard is even easier to type on -- provided you're willing to use both of your hands. Additionally, we noticed that one-handed use is a little easier on a large Windows Phone than an Android device of the same size, and it's primarily because Live Tiles can be so much larger than your typical Android app icon.. In many ways, Microsoft's original mantra of "Glance and Go" is even easier on a 6-inch display, thanks to an extra column of medium-sized Live Tiles on the right side. On smaller screens, we sometimes worry that the largest Live Tiles will take up too much of the available real estate, but that's not the case on a panel this big. There's plenty of room to customize the screen as you see fit, but we can think of at least one downside: A few screens, such as the app switcher or application list, don't take advantage of the extra space afforded to them on larger displays. In those specific cases, then, a smaller display actually feels more ideal.. Outside of what Nokia has added on the software side, Windows Phone feels the same as it ever did. The ecosystem is getting much more exciting, but otherwise any issues you may have had with WP8 devices won't magically go away with Update 3. (One such complaint is the lack of a robust notification center, but we recognize that many users' needs are met with Live Tiles and toast notifications.). The Nokia Lumia 1020 made waves with its 41-megapixel camera, which featured some new imaging technologies that even put some point-and-shoots to shame. After such a fantastic introduction, what's the best way to follow up? Well, something tells us that the real follow-up to the 1020 is yet to come, as the 1520's shooter is actually a downgrade. But we can't really blame Nokia for this: It clearly had to cut some corners in order to make room for some of the 1520's other new features mentioned earlier, and if a 20-megapixel camera counts as "cutting corners," you know that Nokia's certainly doing something right.. We won't do another recap of how Nokia's PureView technology works -- we spent a considerable amount of time discussing the nitty-gritty details in our review of the Lumia 1020, so add that to your essential reading list -- but let's dig into what makes this particular version of the PureView special. Just like the 1020, the 1520 offers oversampling options, but due to the lower resolution, you'll get a high-res image taken at 19 megapixels along with a 5MP lower-res shot, which will come in handy for uploading your photos to Instagram, Facebook or whatever service you want. By the way, the higher-res image can also be taken in RAW format, which you can switch to in the settings (Nokia refers to it as DNG, or digital negative). Nokia also claims that since the 1020 came out, it's improved many of the imaging-capture algorithms involved in snapping shots.. The 1520's lens uses an aperture of f/2.4, compared to the 1020's f/2.2; it has a sensor size of 1/2.5 inch, which is significantly smaller than the 1020's 1/1.5; it features optical image stabilization (OIS) and offers a focal length of 26mm, which is the same on both. Finally, the 1520 matches the 1020 with a max ISO of 4000.. When we reviewed the Lumia 1020 this past summer, we noted that the new Nokia Pro Camera app was one of the best -- if not the best -- we've ever had the pleasure of using, but there was one thing missing: integration with its other clever imaging app, Nokia Smart Camera. A shame, since it offers cool options like action shot, eraser mode, best shot and motion blur. These were incredibly useful tools for imaging enthusiasts, but the fact that they were contained in a separate app felt inefficient. Fortunately, Nokia found a way to merge the two, and is calling the final product "Nokia Camera." To access the Smart Camera features, just slide up on the toggle switch to the right -- the one that previously only let you switch between video and photo mode. It's faster to use it this way, and you stand a much better chance of selecting the right type of picture you want to take in a split second.. The user interface is still mostly the same as it was on the 1020, but the row of icons on the top can be transformed into a much simpler "auto mode." This consists of two switches: one for the flash, and the other to change to sport mode and night mode (apparently the result of another algorithm Nokia is using to make for better low-light shots.. Nokia's added another lens to the phone, and this one's a doozy: It's called Refocus Lens, and in many respects, it's Nokia's answer to the Lytro, which can change a picture's depth of field after the fact. Press the shutter button and the Lens will take a few seconds to do its magic. Once it's ready to go, you can choose any part of the image and change the focus to the area you selected. We found that this feature works best when your picture includes a close-up object and another object in the distance. The color pop feature is also now included as part of this Lens, so keep that in mind if you plan to experiment with color. The Lens is a lot of fun to play with, but if you have a critical moment that needs to be captured in a short period of time, we wouldn't recommend going this route -- it's still a separate app for now.. An unmistakable advantage the PureView-branded Lumias have over any other smartphone is the large number of manual settings: ISO, shutter speed, white balance and exposure are among the options you can tweak to make the picture do what you want it to, rather than having it go the other way around. Sure, you're not going to get as many details in the 19-megapixel stills as you would in the 38MP images that were taken by the Lumia 1020, but what you get in the 1520 camera still far surpasses anything else on the market today. In other words, you may have to sacrifice just a small amount of the quality you can enjoy on the 1020, but we have a feeling it won't matter to the vast majority of users -- especially if you aren't trying to replace your point-and-shoot. The colors are mostly accurate, although we noticed that the white balance was sometimes off in dimmer shooting conditions. Depending on the angle, some pics taken in direct sunlight would look slightly washed out, but these kinds of things are easy enough to address by tinkering with the settings.. Lowlight performance is another area of intense focus for Nokia. Few other companies can match the latest PureView devices, with the 1520 being just the latest triumph. I was elated when I was able to take a Night Mode picture of my kids in a nearly pitch-black room and still easily pick them out. As expected, there's still a little bit of blur if you keep the shutter speed too low, and there's also more than enough noise to go around when you try to show off your latest triumph..

Performance and battery life Nokia Lumia 1520 Nokia Lumia 1020 Nokia Lumia 925 WPBench 466 223 216 Battery rundown 3:30 2:12 3:55 SunSpider 1.0 (MS) 546 906.2 905.4 AnTuTu (*GPU test off) 25,148 (22,275*) 11,084 (9,874*) 11,819* SunSpider: lower scores are better. With video performance, you have a choice of either 1080p or 720p, and you can record those videos at 24, 25 or 30fps (the default setting is 1080p at 30fps). Moving objects look incredibly smooth in our test footage, which was recorded at a 19Mbps Bit rate. The movie-making experience was pretty much the same as on the Lumia 1020; the camera's optical image stabilization kept shakiness to a minimum, and the four directional mics made a rather large difference in audio clarity. In one sample, for instance, the mics couldn't pick up my voice very well because I was on the front side of the Lumia, but I could perfectly hear the song playing out of the speakers not too far away from where I was standing. As I panned away from the large speakers, though, I noticed that the sound from the same place suddenly became distant.. For a long time, Microsoft insisted that it didn't need to support the absolute fastest processors in order to provide a smooth Windows Phone experience -- especially since these more robust chips often put a dent in battery life. Indeed, when it came to everyday use, the company had a point. However, faster chipsets often make it possible to add new features that slower processors simply can't handle. These often include new opportunities for better image signal processors (obviously a big deal for Nokia), stereoscopic 3D, UHD video capture/playback, USB 3.0 and things like 802.11ac WiFi, which is now included on the 1520.. With the latest update, WP8 now supports faster chips like the quad-core Snapdragon 800, and Nokia didn't waste any time tossing it into the Lumia 1520. The silicon, which is also known as the MSM8974, comes with four Krait 400 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and a quad-core Adreno 330 GPU, and Nokia topped it off with 2GB of RAM. Indeed, this is the first time we've been able to say a Nokia flagship comes with the latest and greatest processor.. As much as we'd like to use the usual buzzwords like "buttery smooth," our first experience with Snapdragon 800 on a Windows Phone didn't prove to be that much better than what we've seen on an S4 Plus device like the Lumia 1020. In side-by-side comparisons with the 1020, the 1520 loaded programs only slightly faster (the one exception being the camera). Meanwhile, transitions, animations and everyday tasks all felt the same as ever. Two groups of people will likely have more to benefit from the Snapdragon 800 on Windows Phone than anyone else: there are those who want support for more functionality on the side, as we briefly discussed earlier, and improved gaming performance.. Of course, we're not saying that all the extra power is going to waste -- we're just not seeing as huge a difference as we were expecting. In contrast, Android devices running Snapdragon 800 are often exponentially improved over older devices, and you can usually tell the difference immediately. Our takeaway, then, is that Windows Phone was already quite efficient; Microsoft's done a great job ensuring lower-specced devices are able to run as well as the flagships.. We only run a handful of benchmarks on Windows Phone, but you can certainly tell that Snapdragon 800 is killing it behind the scenes, even if we can't see it up front: The 1520 blows away any other Windows Phone that's ever seen the light of day. What this tells us is that while you might not notice a huge difference on the day-to-day stuff, the most exciting benefits of Snapdragon 800 are still ahead of us.. New features like a quad-core processor and high-res display are fantastic additions to Windows Phone, but what kind of impact does it have on battery life? Runtime on the 1520's battery is about what we expected; this battery is one of the largest in a phone of its size, so our preconceived notions of its performance were admittedly pretty high. On our first full day of regular use, which included taking quite a few pictures, downloading a few apps, checking email and social media and a few other standard smartphone activities, the phone yielded around 12 hours of juice. This would be pretty good for most phones, but a power-efficient platform like Windows Phone should be able to squeeze even more life out of a 3,400mAh battery. On the second full day of regular use, however, its life appeared to bounce back after conducting countless photo sessions and other activities. By the end of that 13-hour day, we still had roughly 30 percent left. Because of the inconsistencies, we're conducting some additional tests. We'll continue to update this review as those results come in. ( Update: the WPBench battery drain test merited a time of 3:30. This is just shy of the Lumia 925's time and significantly better than the 1020.). The Lumia 1520 is coming out this Friday on AT&T, and will be available for $199 on a two-year contract (or $585 if you want to purchase it with no strings attached). This is the same on-contract price as the Lumia 1020, which is still a good option, especially if you're interested in getting a Windows Phone with a smaller screen or if you want the best possible imaging performance.. If size is of utmost importance, the only competition you'll find out there runs on Android. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which is available on all four major national networks, has a 5.7-inch display and is slightly smaller in every dimension, and you'll get to use the S Pen and Multi-window functionality. In our opinion, it's also more comfortable. There's also the HTC One Max, which measures 5.9 inches and features a fingerprint scanner, along with plenty of other nice features. If you're looking to go even more extreme, you might want to check out the Sony Xperia Z Ultra and Huawei Ascend Mate , but each one has a display even larger than the Lumia 1520's.. More Info Nokia Lumia 1520 announced Nokia Lumia 1520 hands-on Nokia Lumia 1020 review. So how does Nokia look when its flagship smartphone has all of the latest and greatest hardware? Pretty darn good. The Lumia 1520 has a beautiful 1080p display, fast Snapdragon 800 processor and some of Espoo's best imaging software to go along with a 20-megapixel camera. As soon as the 1520 was announced, we had a feeling this would be the best Windows Phone we've ever had the privilege of using -- and our time with the device has confirmed that.. Of course, there are going to be some people who don't want this big a screen. Fortunately for them, we strongly suspect Nokia will soon put a 1080p display on a more moderately sized screen. This brings us to perhaps an even more important point, which is the impact Nokia has had and will continue to have on Windows Phone itself: The ecosystem is growing like a weed, and now manufacturers can finally build devices with the best components. These two factors alone are helping Microsoft stay relevant in an increasingly tough market. Now we just have to wait and see how successful Windows Phone can be with the right tools..

Super fast and easy to use. 6-inch, 1920 x 1080 screen; 20MP PureView camera; Windows Phone 8, 2.3 GHz Snapdragon 800; 2GB RAM; microSD, NFC and 802.11n Wi-Fi; 3,200 mAh battery. What is the Nokia Lumia 1520?. Nokia Lumia 1520: Design and Features. The Nokia Lumia 1520 is a landmark phone in the history of Windows Phone. For the first time since its launch, Windows Phone 8’s hardware support has caught up with the iPhone 5S and top Android phones like the Nexus 5. The Lumia 1520’s full HD screen, quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor and 2GB of RAM are exactly what we’ve come to expect from flagship phones. The 1520 is also the largest Windows Phone by a serious margin thanks to its huge 6-inch screen, but should anyone other than the most ardent Windows Phone fan consider buying one? SEE ALSO: 10 best mobile phones you can buy. The Nokia Lumia 1520 is huge, that much is obvious, but the 1520’s design is cut from the same cloth as all the other Nokia Lumia phones. It’s made from a single sheet of sturdy, high quality plastic with the screen protruding ever so slightly outwards from it. It’s a good look and one we’re not bored with yet.. It’s hard to escape the size, though. It’s not thick (8.7mm), but it is exceedingly tall, wide and quite heavy. It’s a full centimetre taller than the already large Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (162.8mm vs 151.2mm) and half a centimetre wider, but it’s also 42 grams heavier. Its heft is hard to ignore, though it’s as much a function of the Lumia 1520’s superior build quality as the size.. Needless to say, then, that this is a ‘two hands’ phone. You can use the Lumia 1520 in one hand for periods, but inevitably something will require you to bring the other one into play. This is just the reality of owning a phone this size, as is the fact it’s a tight fit in most trouser pockets. Reality or not, we prefer the slightly tighter dimensions of the Note 3.. For physical controls it includes a dedicated camera shutter button alongside the usual volume and lock/power buttons. They’re fine, though it’s a little too easy to jog the volume control when you put the phone back in your pocket and they aren’t the easiest to locate by feel alone.. Besides the top-end processor and camera, which we’ll get into a little later, Nokia has truly thrown the kitchen sink at the Lumia 1520. There’s 32GB of built-in memory, but there’s also an up to 64GB microSD card slot. Every wireless standard we can think of is included, too. There’s 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC, not to mention 4G LTE. Did we mention the 1520 supports wireless charging? We didn’t? It does that, too, albeit with a optional dock.. SEE ALSO: 10 best Android phones you can buy. You don’t need us to tell you that the screen on a phone is important, and clearly Nokia doesn’t either. The Lumia 1520’s screen is a triumph. The IPS-based LCD screen is sharp, rich, colourful, responsive, bright… and some other good things we can’t quite recall right now.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

A 1920 x 1080 resolution on a 6-inch screen equates to 367 pixels per inch (ppi), which is plenty sharp enough to ensure text, videos and photos look smooth and detailed in all the right places. And while the size makes the Lumia 1520 a cumbersome phone to use, it’s fantastic for games, videos and web browsing.. It is, as is often pointed out, more like a tablet than a phone. This also makes the Lumia 1520 excellent for working with and viewing Microsoft Office documents, particularly ones with graphics and charts that won’t fit on smaller phones.. Like most Nokia phones, the Lumia 1520 also works when wearing gloves — a neat trick the likes of Apple have yet to adopt. This is a nice-to-have rather than a must have, but it also has the happy side effect of making the Lumia 1520’s screen incredibly sensitive and responsive without gloves.. The black level and contrast isn’t quite as deep and clear as the best AMOLED displays, but the Lumia 1520 is still very good on both counts. It’s excellent when viewed outdoors, too. This is a big help when lining up shots with the camera, somewhere where the size also helps a great deal.. All told, it’s really hard to find fault with the screen. It’s by far and away the highlight of the phone.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

It is not the fault of NOKIA, the giant. It is the fault of MS and Win10. I bought it 30 month ago, and I was very happy with it and enjoyed the upgrade to windows 10 but I can not accept the shortcomings of win10 anymore..

This phone is more power than precision, and it's a mammoth beast - but with a scaled up core and more icons, we do like the direction its poking Windows Phone into.. With the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and the LG G4 , the smartphone war appears to have moved on from processor cores and camera megapixels and into the realm of screen inches and pixel density.. It's not what your phone does, it's at how large a scale it does it, and how sharply.. This trend towards the pocket-filling may run counter to the whole concept of a "mobile" phone, but that's to misunderstand what customers these days want from their phones (or at least think they want).. People have the taste for HD films, uncompromised web browsing and expansive gaming on the go. They don't want mobile phones, they want mobile tablets.. Android has several "phablet" champions, including the ones mentioned above. Now here's the Nokia Lumia 1520 to provide the first large-screen Windows Phone 8 flagship.. In fact, scratch that: with the possible exception of the Nokia Lumia 930 the Nokia Lumia 1520 is the Windows Phone 8 flagship, full stop.. It's evident in the spec sheet alone. This was the first Windows Phone 8 device with a Full HD 1080p display. It's also the first to run on a quad-core processor.. We're not just talking about any HD display either. We're talking about a 6-inch 1920 x 1080 IPS LCD screen (producing 367ppi) with Nokia's ClearBlack and super-sensitive technologies. The former means that you can see it better when outside, and the latter means you can use it with your gloves on - two immensely practical features that tend to get brushed over too quickly.. While we're at it, this isn't just any quad-core processor, either. This Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chip, clocked at 2.2GHz and backed by a healthy 2GB of RAM, is a pretty powerful quad-core chip. It's the same processor as can be found in the Google Nexus 5 and in Windows Phone land only the Nokia Lumia 930 can rival it.. With these two components alone, Nokia lifted the Windows Phone platform to specification parity with its Android rivals after three solid years of trailing firmly in its wake. It's since been topped by the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S6 and HTC One M9 , but it's still quite a big achievement.. The Nokia Lumia 1520 is big in every way. Opening the box drew a genuine gasp from this typically stony-faced writer, who moments before had been typing out an email on his teeny-tiny iPhone 5S .. Initially, the Nokia Lumia 1520 looks ridiculous next to Apple's stubbornly compact phone and even towers over the newer and larger iPhone 6. After a few hours' company with the 1520, you might well find that the iPhone 5S looks and feels like a toy.. That's not to say that we prefer the Lumia 1520 as a day-to-day tool. Let's be straight - it's too big for most general users.. At 6.41 x 3.36in, it will slip into the back pocket of your jeans, but only if it's that pair you bought in preparation for the forthcoming festive pig-out. And there won't be space in there for anything else.. In fact, now might be the time to acquaint yourself with a good tailor, because you'll either need to reinforce those pockets or repair them. At 206g, this is one hefty piece of kit.. To place the Lumia 1520's size and weight in context, it's a good 30g heavier than the Galaxy Note 4 with its similarly sized 5.7-inch display, and is a whole centimeter taller. Having said all that, the Nokia Lumia 1520 feels surprisingly sleek in the hand, and that's partly down to its 8.7mm thickness. Compared to other Lumia phones like the Nokia Lumia 1020 or the Nokia Lumia 930, it's proportionally flatter.. Even the 20MP PureView camera barely breaks the rear contour with its subtle blister shape, unlike the angry carbuncle on Nokia's previous phone, the Lumia 1020.. Then there's Nokia's customary high-class build quality. We've said it before, but Nokia is the only other smartphone manufacturer out there capable of rivaling Apple and HTC for strong, distinctive design.. The Lumia 1520 continues Nokia's predilection for unibody polycarbonate designs. This means that it's essentially carved out of a single solid chunk of posh plastic. If you've never held a Nokia Lumia device before, then think of the HTC One X and you'll have an idea of how it feels.. We didn't dare put it to the test, but the Lumia 1520 feels like it would survive its share of drops, and certainly a little rough and tumble - although its sharply pointed corners are asking to be dinged, and it doesn't use the very latest version of toughened Gorilla Glass.. There's a slight ridge where the display meets the chassis. When Nokia introduced this design with the Nokia Lumia 800 , its display melted into its body, which added an extra feel of class. It's a shame that's not been included here.. Curiously, after the flamboyant flourishes witnessed elsewhere (especially in the shocking yellow of our test model), the Nokia Lumia 1520's physical buttons seem almost coy. They're practically flush with the chassis along the right hand side - even the two-stage physical camera shutter button barely raises its head.. This helps with the ergonomics of this unwieldy device, but doesn't help when you're fumbling for the volume controls in the dark.. On the opposite side of the device you have the microSD card slot and the SIM slot. The former is in addition to the 32GB of internal memory, raising the possibility of a whopping 96GB of storage.. The latter accepts a nanoSIM, which is even smaller than the micro SIMs found in previous Nokia phones. It's the same standard used by Apple, and it serves to free up a few valuable millimeters of space for other internal components. Although we doubt that the Lumia 1520's innards are exactly struggling for air.. In summary, the Nokia Lumia 1520 is certainly striking, but we wouldn't want to be struck with one. You're getting a lot of phone here for around $550 / £360 / AU$500. That is, if you can actually find it, which is becoming increasingly hard, especially in the UK..

The Nokia 8 Sirocco edition is 95-percent glass. Nokia Lumia 1520 hands-on: the weighty new flagship is here. Don't act like you didn't know this was coming. Nokia has finally removed the see-through shroud covering its latest high-end device, known as the Lumia 1520 , at Nokia World in Abu Dhabi. Thing is, it's not like any Windows Phone you've gazed upon before -- it's a top of the line smartphone with Microsoft's third WP8 update and many of the best specs you can get. Not only is it the first 6-inch 1080p smartphone to run Windows Phone OS, it's also the first that's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 SoC (a quad-core chipset clocked at 2.2GHz). Nokia aims to sell the flagship for $750 unsubsidized later this year and it comes in four color options: red, white, black and yellow. The first two are glossy, while the latter two come with a matte finish.. If you've used or seen most Lumia devices in the past, the phone's overall design will not come as a surprise; it's dressed in Nokia's traditional unibody polycarbonate, though it looks like a Lumia 920 that got flattened with a mallet. That's not a bad thing, since it's 8.6mm thick (with the exception of the 1520's camera bump, which reminds us of the 925), but thanks to its 85.4mm-wide chassis, you'll need the phone to be as thin as possible to even think of using this as a one-handed device; it's three millimeters wider than the HTC One Max (and six millimeters wider than the Samsung Galaxy Note 3), which means the only reason it's even tolerable to hold with one hand is its thin profile and smooth curved edges. Check out our gallery of hands-on pictures and meet us after the break for more impressions and details.. Gallery: Nokia Lumia 1520 hands-on | 12 Photos. The 1520 comes with a 20MP BSI F/2.4 PureView camera with OIS and Carl Zeiss lens, which numberwise isn't technically quite up to par with the 41MP sensor photography enthusiasts enjoy on the 1020, but we believe it will be more than enough for most power users. The real story with the new Lumia isn't its resolution or detail this time around, however -- it's the software capabilities of the phone. Thankfully, Nokia has combined the Pro and Smart camera lenses, which makes it much easier to switch back and forth between your preferences. There's also something Nokia calls the Refocus Lens, which is a fruit of the company's Scalado acquisition; this lens is like a software-based version of Lytro, which uses "clever algorithms" to let you change the focus of your photo after it's taken. (This lens will debut on the 1520 and eventually make it to older Lumia devices, such as the 900 series.). It's hard not to like the rest of the 1520's spec sheet: it's capable of Qi wireless charging, has a 3,400mAh battery, 32GB of internal storage, microSD expansion up to 64GB, 2GB of RAM, four mics that simulates surround sound, a 1.2MP front-facing cam and even a dual LED flash to go along with the rear camera. Given the similar plastic matt finish and build quality, the phone feels very much like the Lumia 920 but in a similar shape as the metallic Lumia 925. Like the 1320, this phone is also just as slim for a 6-inch phone, but it's just ever so slightly heavier which is likely due to the built-in wireless charging. As the new flagship device, its top notch 1080p display is well worth the extra money over the lesser 1320..

Five reasons I dropped my iPhone 5 for a Nokia Lumia 1020. AT&T Nokia Lumia 1020 review: The best Windows Phone ever made. Nokia announces Lumia 1520 and 1320, Instagram finally coming to Windows Phone. Nokia Lumia 1020: Unmatched camera experience in a growing Windows Phone market. Photo shootout: Nokia Lumia 1020, PureView 808, Lumia 925, HTC One, and iPhone 5. Nokia Lumia 1020 announced; advanced 41 megapixel camera at $300 contract price. Nokia Lumia 1020: OIS, 2GB RAM, and photos from the device revealed. Microsoft's Windows Phone OS held Nokia back from releasing a smartphone to compete head-to-head in specs with Android. Like the rebellious child held back by strict parents who then gets freedom to tear it up, we see Nokia went a bit crazy with the Lumia 1520 and made a device that's just too big for anyone to comfortably handle.. In addition, AT&T was unfortunately given some leeway with the device and knocked it down a few points in my rating with their modifications so the Nokia Lumia 1520 doesn't get my nod as the best Windows Phone device.. The best is subjective and each one of us has different needs, desires, and thresholds so my feelings may not match yours. is the best Windows Phone device while the. If you are a cousin to Andre the Giant with large hands then the 1520 may not look ridiculous for you. I have pretty large hands, but like the. the Lumia 1520 simply looks silly in my hands and as amazing as the display is it will never be my daily driver.. I understand that you may be reading this review because you want a large phone and don't see that as a con. I didn't not consider it a con for the Galaxy Note 3 because there is a valid reason for the size of that device, yet I do not see a compelling reason for Nokia to jump from 4.5 inches to 6 inches with the Lumia 1520.. The massive 6 inch 1920 by 1080 resolution ClearBlack IPS LCD display is drop dead gorgeous and will likely blow you away. Nokia's ClearBlack technology is amazing and in the outside demo booth at Nokia's HQ last week I didn't see another device that could match it's direct sunlight visibility.. The display is definitely the focal point of the Lumia 1520 design, but the massive size is also a feature that I think will severely limit its usefulness to most people. Even with my size 36 jeans, the Lumia 1520 sticks out of my large back pocket nearly an inch. There is simply no way to carry the 1520 comfortably in your jeans or shirt pocket and it may not even fit in your coat pocket.. Nokia did a pretty good job of minimizing the side bezel on the 1520, but the length and width are ridiculous. Samsung was able to sell millions of Note devices, even after being laughed at by many people at first, in large part because of the usefulness of the S Pen that justified having a large display for handwriting. With devices like the HTC One Max and Lumia 1520 there is very little reason for having such a massive display and I hope to see this trend stop soon.. Media consumption may be a good reason for the HTC One Max, but until Microsoft puts back in video rental/purchase support (they had it in Windows Phone 7 and then took it out in Windows Phone 8) there really is no compelling video experience unless you stream content.. Above the display you will find the 1.2 megapixel front facing camera with the traditional three capacitive buttons (back, Start, and search) below the display. The 3.5mm headset jack is centered on the top with the microUSB port centered on the bottom.. The microSD and nanoSIM card slots are inserted into removable card slots on the upper left. A removal tool is required to be inserted into the hole to pop out the card holders.. Nokia design fails on the right side where there are four buttons that are barely discernible from the side of the device. Two volume buttons, a power button, and a camera capture button live on the right side and match the matte white finish of the unit I was sent.. I handed the 1520 to several people and they had trouble even finding the buttons. Even a Windows Phone fan like myself was unable to repeatedly hit the correct buttons since they barely protrude out from the side. Nokia rocked the side button design with the Lumia 925 so I cannot begin to imagine why they went with this terrible design on the Lumia 1520.. The back of the Lumia 1520 is similar to the Lumia 925 with tapered edges and a small protrusion for the camera module. The flash is positioned above the camera lens with the speaker opening down just above the microUSB port. The speaker plays very well for a mono speaker positioned on the back.. Nokia was able to get a 20 megapixel camera into the thin 1520 and in my preliminary tests it takes photos as well as the Lumia 1020. The camera also has the capability of capturing RAW images, but like most consumers this doesn't affect my purchase decision at all.. There is a large 3,400 mAh battery inside and over the last couple of days the device has performed well and gotten me through full days. The battery is powering a large display so this size is needed to power you through a day.. AT&T took out the Qi wireless charging capability on the Lumia 1520 since they support the PMA standard. You can buy an Incipio PMA shell for the 1520, but I still think this is a terrible precedent to set. Nokia has several Qi wireless charging accessories and NONE will work with the 1520. AT&T had no problem supporting the 920, 925, and 1020 with Qi charging plates and even though this is a small feature for some it ticks me off to no end.AT&T also launched the Lumia 1520 with just 16 GB (about 12 GB are usable) of internal storage. There is a microSD card slot, but there are limitations for using external storage so gamers and application fans will likely bump into this limitation.. I heard that AT&T will eventually launch a 32GB model, but there is no reason that wasn't available first and I hope buyers don't go to the store to get a 16 GB only to find they max out a month later.. The Nokia Lumia 1520 launches with the latest Nokia Black software and like all versions of Windows Phone it flies. You will find the ability to close apps manually with an X button in the task switcher, an extra column of icons (medium size) on the massive Start screen.. We also see that Microsoft includes their Driving Mode in the settings. It's not nearly as great as Motorola Assist on the Moto X and requires a Bluetooth device to be connected to manage communications while you are driving.. Windows Phone hasn't changed much since its launch in 2007, but more and more apps are launching and there really is not much of an app gap anymore. The differentiators now are the notifications, multi-tasking capability, and connectivity with accessories like the. This latest software update supports Bluetooth LE so now it is up to developers to get support for these handy accessories.. It is hilarious, sad really, that the Lumia 1520 could be a video playing machine, but Microsoft took out the ability to rent or buy movies and TV shows with Windows Phone 8. I understand they will finally add this capability back before the end of the year with Xbox Video. In the meantime, why do they even have a Music & Videos hub with no video support? Geeks may have lots of ripped DVD content, but the average commuter rents or buys TV shows from iTunes or Google Play.. AT&T has loaded up the device with all of they typical bloatware junk, but as I. Windows Phone gives you the ability to remove all of this crap. AT&T apps include AT&T Address Book, AT&T FamilyMap, AT&T Locker, AT&T Navigator, and AT&T Radio.. Nokia also loaded up the device with many of their apps and services and for the most part these are all quite useful. Nokia apps include Nokia Camera, Nokia Creative Studio, Nokia MixRadio, Nokia Refocus, Nokia Screen Beamer, and Nokia Storyteller.. I saw a demo of Storyteller last Friday, but haven't been able to figure out how to get any photos into the app that I didn't capture on the 1520. I thought it would sync to my the Photos hub, but that doesn't seem to be the case unless I am completely missing something.. Google and Microsoft don't get along and this was evident on the 1520 when I setup my Gmail account by selecting the Google service from the list. I kept getting an error that I later was told was due to contact sync failure so had to remove this conduit. I then set it up as an Exchange account and it works just fine.. Google services users won't find much support on Windows Phone though with no Google+, no Hangouts, no Google Maps, and very limited Gmail functionality. The Microsoft services are excellent, but not everyone is a service switcher either.. The Lumia 1520 is a beautiful device, but it is simply too big to be comfortably carried and used on a daily basis. The camera performs well and all of the great Nokia services are there for you to enjoy. The keyboard size is ridiculous and takes up nearly half of the massive display so while you can easily tap the keys the reach is a bit much even for my hands.. A red CP-623 protective cover was sent along and it is a bit of a silly case. It provides a flap to cover the display and looks an awful lot like an iPad Smart Cover. However, the display doesn't turn on and off when you open and close the flap. You can fold up the flap just like on an iPad to prop up the 1520 in landscape orientation. However, very few apps support landscape on Windows Phone so its usefulness is limited. A Qi charging cover would be more useful.. I love what Nokia does with their plastics and the back of the Lumia 1520 feels fantastic. The right button design is terrible though and given you can hardly feel the buttons, the color blends in to the white shell, and massive width I found I often pressed the wrong button.. To summarize my experiences with the Nokia Lumia 1520, here are my pros and cons.. AT&T yet again scores another exclusive and with that comes the inability to get it from them at full price and get it unlocked until the exclusive deal ends, which is likely in six months.. The 16GB Lumia 1520 is available for just $100 with a 2-year contract with the full price at $584.99. I would personally look to an international model with 32GB and Qi wireless charging, but am not interested in replacing my 1020 with such a large phone.. It will be available in red, black, white, and yellow. I tested out the white model.. Other large screen phones, greater than 5 inches, include the Galaxy Note 3, HTC One Max, Sony Xperia Z Ultra, LG G2, and maybe even the Google Nexus 5. The HTC One Max is a bit thicker than the Lumia 1520, but very similar in size. The rest are all smaller, which is hilarious when you think of when people thought the Note 3 was the biggest game in town.. The Nokia Lumia 1520 is a beast of a phone with the best specifications of any Windows Phone device to date. Microsoft did a great job minimizing the needs of the OS so many of these specifications are not necessarily needed to provide a full Windows Phone experience.. The display is simply too large, the right side button design is unacceptable, the removal of Qi is an embarrassment for Nokia, and no high end smartphone should ever launch with less than 32GB of internal storage.. My perfect Windows Phone 8 device would be the Nokia Lumia 935 (made up name) that takes the 925 form factor and puts in everything from the Lumia 1520. I could even live with dropping microSD support with 32GB or 64GB of internal storage.. I understand the international version of the Lumia 1520 includes Qi charging and 32GB of internal storage. It is still too big for a daily driver, but at least it isn't neutered by a wireless carrier.. Published: November 21, 2013 -- 15:16 GMT (23:16 GMT+08:00).

AT&T Nokia Lumia 1520 review: Beast of a phone, but not the best. Nokia's massive 6-inch Windows Phone is available this week and includes all the best specs allowed by Microsoft. However, AT&T made some design trade-offs that detract from the overall value.. Gorgeous, high quality 6 inch 1080p display. Value added Nokia applications and services. Massive sized phone for no compelling reason. Lack of support for Qi charging. Limited 12 GB available internal storage memory. Windows Phone 8 OS with GDR 3 and Nokia Black. Snapdragon 800 quad-core 2.2 GHz processor. 2GB RAM and 16GB flash storage. 6 inch 1080p ClearBlack resolution display at 368 ppi. 20 megapixel rear PureView camera with Carl Zeiss optics. 802.11 a/ac/b/g/n WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0. Dimensions of 162.8 x 85.4 x 8.7 mm and 206 grams (7.27 ounces). Contributor's rating: 7.5 out of 10. Nokia's Lumia 1520 Windows Phablet: Some benefits worth the weight.

Nokia Lumia 1020: OIS, 2GB RAM, and photos from the device revealed. Microsoft's Windows Phone OS held Nokia back from releasing a smartphone to compete head-to-head in specs with Android. Like the rebellious child held back by strict parents who then gets freedom to tear it up, we see Nokia went a bit crazy with the Lumia 1520 and made a device that's just too big for anyone to comfortably handle.. In addition, AT&T was unfortunately given some leeway with the device and knocked it down a few points in my rating with their modifications so the Nokia Lumia 1520 doesn't get my nod as the best Windows Phone device.. The best is subjective and each one of us has different needs, desires, and thresholds so my feelings may not match yours. is the best Windows Phone device while the. If you are a cousin to Andre the Giant with large hands then the 1520 may not look ridiculous for you. I have pretty large hands, but like the. the Lumia 1520 simply looks silly in my hands and as amazing as the display is it will never be my daily driver.. I understand that you may be reading this review because you want a large phone and don't see that as a con. I didn't not consider it a con for the Galaxy Note 3 because there is a valid reason for the size of that device, yet I do not see a compelling reason for Nokia to jump from 4.5 inches to 6 inches with the Lumia 1520.. The massive 6 inch 1920 by 1080 resolution ClearBlack IPS LCD display is drop dead gorgeous and will likely blow you away. Nokia's ClearBlack technology is amazing and in the outside demo booth at Nokia's HQ last week I didn't see another device that could match it's direct sunlight visibility.. The display is definitely the focal point of the Lumia 1520 design, but the massive size is also a feature that I think will severely limit its usefulness to most people. Even with my size 36 jeans, the Lumia 1520 sticks out of my large back pocket nearly an inch. There is simply no way to carry the 1520 comfortably in your jeans or shirt pocket and it may not even fit in your coat pocket.. Nokia did a pretty good job of minimizing the side bezel on the 1520, but the length and width are ridiculous. Samsung was able to sell millions of Note devices, even after being laughed at by many people at first, in large part because of the usefulness of the S Pen that justified having a large display for handwriting. With devices like the HTC One Max and Lumia 1520 there is very little reason for having such a massive display and I hope to see this trend stop soon.. Media consumption may be a good reason for the HTC One Max, but until Microsoft puts back in video rental/purchase support (they had it in Windows Phone 7 and then took it out in Windows Phone 8) there really is no compelling video experience unless you stream content.. Above the display you will find the 1.2 megapixel front facing camera with the traditional three capacitive buttons (back, Start, and search) below the display. The 3.5mm headset jack is centered on the top with the microUSB port centered on the bottom.. The microSD and nanoSIM card slots are inserted into removable card slots on the upper left. A removal tool is required to be inserted into the hole to pop out the card holders.. Nokia design fails on the right side where there are four buttons that are barely discernible from the side of the device. Two volume buttons, a power button, and a camera capture button live on the right side and match the matte white finish of the unit I was sent.. I handed the 1520 to several people and they had trouble even finding the buttons. Even a Windows Phone fan like myself was unable to repeatedly hit the correct buttons since they barely protrude out from the side. Nokia rocked the side button design with the Lumia 925 so I cannot begin to imagine why they went with this terrible design on the Lumia 1520.. The back of the Lumia 1520 is similar to the Lumia 925 with tapered edges and a small protrusion for the camera module. The flash is positioned above the camera lens with the speaker opening down just above the microUSB port. The speaker plays very well for a mono speaker positioned on the back.. Nokia was able to get a 20 megapixel camera into the thin 1520 and in my preliminary tests it takes photos as well as the Lumia 1020. The camera also has the capability of capturing RAW images, but like most consumers this doesn't affect my purchase decision at all.. There is a large 3,400 mAh battery inside and over the last couple of days the device has performed well and gotten me through full days. The battery is powering a large display so this size is needed to power you through a day.. AT&T took out the Qi wireless charging capability on the Lumia 1520 since they support the PMA standard. You can buy an Incipio PMA shell for the 1520, but I still think this is a terrible precedent to set. Nokia has several Qi wireless charging accessories and NONE will work with the 1520. AT&T had no problem supporting the 920, 925, and 1020 with Qi charging plates and even though this is a small feature for some it ticks me off to no end.AT&T also launched the Lumia 1520 with just 16 GB (about 12 GB are usable) of internal storage.

Published: November 26, 2013 01:30 PM. The sleek Nokia Lumia 1520 smart phone features a gorgeous 6-inch display with a tiny bezel, a great 20-megapixel camera with cool features, and a practically immortal battery. But this Windows phone is huge, so big that nobody but an NBA star will be able to manage it with one hand.. The phone measures a seam-shredding 6.40 x 3.36 x 0.33 inches, approaching the size of a small tablet. You'll probably need two hands to operate it, and you're likely to draw stares when you hold this slab up to your head to make or take a call.. Still, depending on what you need, it might be worth the effort. Our initial tests of a press sample found the 6-inch display ultra sharp even in bright sunlight, and its camera produced excellent-quality images. The mega-capacity 3400mAh battery delivered more than 24 hours of talk time on a single charge.. Smart phones with large, sharp displays are ideal for watching videos, browsing Web pages, and reading e-books. And the Lumia 1520's ample 6-inch HD display is easily among the best we've seen for those tasks.. This Nokia comes with the latest version of Windows 8 (Update 3), which not only adds support for such large displays, but also leverages their generous viewing area to show you three columns of Windows Live Tiles instead of the typical two. Another Update 3 benefit: support for quad-core processors, such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800, which helps make the display more responsive and allows videos to play with fewer jitters. Indeed, videos played on the Lumia 1520 look fantastic.. Eye-popping display aside, the Lumia 1520 tests the limits of what passes for a smart phone. It's all but impossible to perform most operations with one hand, and this phone is even hard to grip with two—especially when you try to use it as a camera. Its thin, rounded edges are rather slippery, and reaching for on-screen camera menus when both hands are gripping the phone takes some effort.. Thankfully, the side-mounted shutter release is close enough to your fingers to make snapping pictures or starting video recording less of a stretch. The phone also weighs more than 7 ounces, which means you'll be looking for a lap or stand to rest it on after a few minutes of use.. Find the best model for your needs and budget with our cell phone buying guide and Ratings .. The phone's 20-megapixel camera (it uses only 18.7 megapixels for photos) has a short shutter lag and produced excellent-quality pictures at ISO settings up to 1600. It also did very well under low-light conditions—most likely aided by its image stabilizer. In fact, the Lumia 1520 grabbed details that would have been obscured by grain and shadows on other phone cameras.. But video recorded at 1080p was only decent—adequate for uploads to Facebook and YouTube, but no match for the very good videos you can take with an iPhone 5s or Samsung Galaxy Note 3 .. Like the Lumia 1020 , this phone comes with a Pro Camera app that presents an arc of a half-dozen individual controls for manipulating exposure levels and other adjustments. They include manual-exposure settings such as shutter speed, ISO, manual focus, white balance, and exposure compensation.. Consumer Reports' camera expert Terry Sullivan found those controls to be nicely designed and easy to use. You can slide the controls to make precise selections, which worked pretty well in our trials. You can also set the camera on Auto and let it select those settings for you.. The adjustments made using the Lumia's Pro Cam app appear instantly on the display, preventing unpleasant surprises. One thing we really liked: The interactive tutorial, which shows you real-time changes to images as you change shutter speed and other exposure settings.

The Nokia Lumia 1520's long battery life and bodacious display may be ideal for media-addicted smart-phone buyers with a touch of tablet envy, though accessing its phone or camera functions will be a bit of a stretch for some people..

Page 10: Image Quality Comparison (Raw). DPReview smartphone reviews are written with the needs of photographers in mind. We focus on camera features, performance, and image quality.. When Samsung launched the 5.3-inch Galaxy Note at IFA 2011, the phablet, as devices with screens larger than 5 inches are now commonly called, was born. Initially there was doubt as to whether these oversized smartphones would catch on with consumers but in 2014 it's fair to say that phablets are here to stay.. With the 5.5-inch Note 3 Samsung is marketing the third generation of its Galaxy phablet. Sony is competing with the 6.4-inch Sony Xperia Z Ultra and HTC has thrown the 5.9-inch One Max into the mix. With all those devices using the Android operating system the users of other platforms have so far been excluded from the phablet movement.. However, now Nokia has responded with the 6-inch Lumia 1520 which uses the Windows Phone operating system. The 1520 does not only come with a large 1080p screen but offers high-end specs all-around. The device is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor and ships with2GB of RAM but it's the camera specs that should make the 1520 an appealing option for mobile photographers.. The PureView branded camera combines a 1/2.5-inch 20MP BSI CMOS sensor with a F2.4 lens and optical image stabilization. Following the same concept as the Nokia 808 and Lumia 1020 the new model saves downsampled 5MP images but also lets you access the full 20MP files. In addition you can set the Lumia 1520 to capture DNG Raw-files which is great news for all those users who like to optimize their image in post-production.. There's news on the software front as well. Nokia Camera combines the manual-control-focused Pro Camera and the feature-packed Smart Camera app. Nokia Storyteller is a new photo management tool that sorts and presents photos either by time captured or location. mimics the effect (although not the method) of a light field camera in that it allows the user to choose a focal point post-capture.. With the promising camera specification and interesting new software features we were curious to find out how the Nokia Lumia 1520 performed as a mobile photographer's daily companion. Read our review and find out how we got on with the new Nokia phablet.. We've considered every aspect of the Nokia Lumia 1520, with the photographer in mind. We examined the user interface of the native camera app and its special features. We experimented with the camera's performance when taking stills and video, and had a play with the device's many special feature modes.

Any chance this review gets updated with the Denim update?. I have a 1520 and OS 8.1 but no DNG? Also, no 19 MP file, only 5 MP (sometimes.) Usually, picture file is somewhere between 250K and 7 MB. Have I missed something or is my unit defective?. Please contact me at: conradweiler3@gmail.com if you can help me get DNG Raw files from Nokia 1520 (OS 8.1). I'm using a Nokia 1520 and it's not clear to me how to access DNG Raw files. The Lumia 1520 offers a Windows Phone experience unlike any we’ve seen before. With its top-notch hardware, fantastic imaging and constantly improving firmware, I can’t be more impressed at a phone this much.. How do you get a digital look with the Nokia 1520? Meaning when j plug my USB in my computer it will show me both normal and high resolution pictures, but when I click on them they look nowhere near as good as I see what people post online. Are you using a different method then me?. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has a 5.7 in screen rather than 5.5in which was the screen size of the Note 2.. I did consider the Nokia 1520 as the camera on the Z Ultra is very poor even for a phone camera but after trying out WP8 for a bit on the 925 I decided not to. There is a lot WP8 does well but the problem for me is the bits it doesn't do so well or you want to do differently, you largely cannot so some elements like the poor keyboard (compared to Swiftkey) you can't change.. I have been having a lot fun with Lumia 1520's camera.. It works fine as long as you don't need fast focus, long lens and print quality.. I have been using it for landscape with good results. The 20Mp camera provides a good quality and high enough resolution for all kind of digital media, including 4k screens.. How do you get a digital look with the Nokia 1520? Meaning when j plug my USB in my computer it will show me both normal and high resolution pictures, but when I click on them they look nowhere near as good as I see what people post online. Are you using a different method then me?. I have a 1520 since last Xmas, and its an amazing piece of tech. Its really un-seperable piece o my daily life.. Will it be possible to update it to 8.1. ? There is no info on Finnish web page of Nokia yet.... Yes, but WP 8.1 is not released yet.. Right now you can get the WP 8.1 Developer Preview and update your Lumia 1520, But you need a Developer Account for that. Otherwise you have to wait until the release WP 8.1.. I have used Nokia Lumia 1520. Its a window Smart phone and its camera is not good and bad result. I have sell my Nokia Lumia 1520 to last week.... Is rear camera glass on this phone scratsch proff? Thanks to info ;). I've this lumia 1520 last month. It's got problem with the camera. I send to Nokia care..after 2 week my phone not return back. For me Nokia phone is very very bad..and also the after sales service is not competence to solve this problem fast. If I compare with iphone n Samsung..NOKIA arena bad.. I came across the comparison article from http://www.gadgetride.com/review/nokia-lumia-1520-vs-galaxy-note-3.html , the lumia 1520 has nice features and look.. yes, but only with an additional charging cover. you will need an additional cover. It's because At&t chose the PMA standard. The version for the rest of the world has Qi wireless charging. It works really well on my Nokia Lumia 720 albeit with a charging cover. To be honest, I wouldn't depend on the phone for photos.. I would slip the Nikon AW110 into my other pocket. Its footprint is even smaller than my Sony Esperia S. It's rain and freeze proof, and comes with wifi.. You can even take semi-submerged shots of a flood. Of course, it has an optical zoom.. On a budget, there is the Nikon S32 $129.. Willing to carry a chunkier camera? There's the Nikon One cameras with PDAF and able to print a clean 18x12. The J1 kit is available for $249. I say why buy a compact camera when I have an awesome camera on my mobile phone.. Because its not an 'awesome' camera its a below average quality but certainly capable one. you can get better quality by getting a compact camera but its up to the user if the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Id always say get a small wifi camera. But if you do't need the zoom, the Nokia is able to pull a lot more detail out of a scene than the AW110, which also lacks RAW. Plus saves you from filling up another pocket and/or switching between devices.. How often do you use the zoom in your MFT?. Just like a sub-par result producing cameras or are you paid to astroturf?. I have had tons of cameras, and shoot most of my "accidental" photos now on my main "always with me camera.". What's always with me? A smart phone.. What's not always with my? My pocket cams.. I could also start spamming this thread with Sony pocket cam information, but that would be digressing.. This is about smartphone photo performance, which has gotten respectable enough to be of use for the most of us.. You can go to the Nikon pocket cam forums to advertise..... I have two DSLRs and my Nokia Lumia 1520. If I need image quality, then I will take the D800E. For snapshots my Lumia is most time with me. There is no need for another P&S camera.. I wonder why Nokia hasn't released standalone compact camera yet. With good sensors, oversampling technology and handy software for settings, it would be interesting camera, I suppose. Especially if equipped with fast lens. Hey Nokia what are you waiting for? You sold your smartfone department to MS, switch now to cameras!. Probably because it wouldn't be a very smart business move :). They sold all the related people, tech & know how to MS along with the phone unit.. All they have left on the imaging side is some tech patents, and they'd rather just license those.. You may not have noted, but Nokia got it's bum handed to them by the markets. They are still licking their wounds.. Don't expect a re-entry to cam or phone business any time soon. They are now in B2B business.. No Android, no apps, no buy.. Do you need thousands of app half of which have malware? Every essential app on Android and iOS is practically on WP right now.. Half of essential apps and more of them are beta's. And who wants Windows 8 on any device. The camera of this phone is nice the OS is not.. It's not a smartphone system, it's a feature phone system, almost as good as Symbian was at it's best.. A good camera does not a smartphone make.. I had this phone for about a week over Christmas....I like larger phones, was sort of bored with Android and decided to try this out....I was pretty satisfied with the general results but the phone was just to big to handle in quick situations. Ultimately, the Windows appstore is so limited I scurried back and got a Note 3 that I have been very happy with.. Yes, this is a huge phone! The screen is nice, but the size for a fully grown man like myself (6') is still too big to be lugged around daily.. What is wrong with all lumia's video record? Why their video so shaky?. I actually think Nokia's IS is one of the best. Look at the last video on the video page, it was taken handheld. Video from page 7 shaking around (like Parkinson's disease). No match for 5s and Z1 steady videos.. Misterio, you mean the first one? (The other two are steady; the third may have been shot from a tripod, it's so steady.) While it indeed shows some annoying shaking, I bet it's still much better than the 5s or the Z1 footage would have been under exactly the same setup.. After all, Connect's own iPhone 5s review has concluded the electronic-only IS of the 5s, while certainly better than that of the iPhone 5, is in no way as efficient as the OIS of the Nokia 920. And I bet the 1520 has at least as efficient OIS as the 920.. Video from 5s and Z1 shake-free. After them I can't watch video from lumia. @misterio Are you sure you are not the one suffering from Parkinson's?. Each system has its strengths and weaknesses. Play to its strength and avoid stressing its weaknesses.. FF may be the best for art pictures. Birding is best done with long telephoto lenses.. My experience is that macro is easiest done with lenses with nice manual focus control.. Each system has its natural strengths.. Yes, one of the greatest strenghts of a phone's camera is that it can fit into places where no big camera (not even small point and shoots) can fit. Having a close focus distance on the phone is a big plus for me and many more people.. The Nikon AW110 has a smaller footprint than the Sony Experia S. And, the AW110 macro distance is according to B&H only Macro: 0.39" (1 cm) - Infinity .. But not many are leaving their phones at home when they bring the Nikon, which means that the AW110 just adds size to the existing phone.. Just put it in your other pocket. It is an amazing smartphone, for its camera and for watching videos during my travels. I own three DSLRs (one FF, two cropped), one mirrorless camera and a Galaxy Note 3 - that I eventually gave my wife. All criticisms hurled at DPR for doing this and towards the device itself - I had to personally use the phone for a few hours before I decided to buy one. It fits my usage model (60-70% business which means lots of emails, editing native MS Office files and web surfing). It is great for instant photo opportunities with friends when I don't have my DSLR with me. It takes HD videos like a number of other smartphones. It excels at everything I want it to do. I will never be rich enough for a smartphone to be custom-built for me :) But after using the Nokia 1520 for a month now, it's the closest smartphone that ever came to that! Thanks DPR for this review!. No one said that the Nokia is a bad instrument. The issue I raised was whether DPR needs a separate mobility site, and to do 11 page reviews of just the camera.. DPR has and did so why did you bother to read and participate against your own better judgement.. For over 3years I used an android 2.3 media device ( Sony Walkman Z.) and a year ago, upgraded it to android 4... It was alright thing for music media games etc. January 2 I got my first smartphone and its a black Lumia 1520. It is freaking fast, while my one cored android Walkman just loading things 1520 has already open them. Camera is enough to defeat my Sony cyber shot W150 (from 2008) and Olympus Xz-1 in daylight. It get very close to my e-pm1 (for landscapes and portraits). Camera interface is very well specified. Its physical shutter button can take two shots sometime, but its only adjusting issue I believe.. after all, since 2014 there is a category called phablet and it is REAL. You don't carry your tablet everytime, and your phone is not read friendly if its screen smaller than 5". Nokia has made a great device I can recommend it to all, who can afford.. last word; dear Nokia, check optional accessories what Sony and Samsung offers for their phablets, and produce similar/better stuff. Note 3 with 4k video and Spen is a monster ! No WP. So you got a 4k tv/screen to enjoy that footage to enjoy (else than your phone) otherwise Full HD is way enough above 400Hz for my taste on my 40" tv.. I like the idea of 4K video since you can use a single frame of the footage as a whole image! You can also zoom in and have way more editing capabilities. I still don't get it why Canon/Nikon don't implement it into their DSLR, probably because they want to keep the market for "professional" videocams.. It is a bit more complicated, actual cameras don't have a DSP enough powerfull or power efficient to reccord high bitrate 4K videos. It was the same story for last 1080.. Time end of this year, even September, you will start to have mass 4K DSLR on the shelves.. That repels many potential buyers, I think. Who cares? It's still not an Android phone, and it definitely is not an iPhone. Yes, that's exactly why people care. It's NOT Android (thanks God) and it's NOT iPhone. All this effort to review a camera phone? Really?. Congratulations! You have just established which camera phone is best. But, are you buying a phone just for the camera?. Yes, I bought my phone for its camera. Do you have a problem with that?. The problem is not why you bought the phone. The issue is why DPR is spending scarce resources on these camera phone reviews.. But will these reviews build readership? Are there not countless technical and mobility sites already doing full reviews (communications, apps and photographic)?. 90% of people who take photos use camera phones, silly DPR for trying to attract new readers!!. DPReview is owned by Amazon.com so resources aren't exactly scarce.. And besides, this is the mobile photography section of DPReview so what else did you expect to find here?. Actually, there was a hysterical thread in Open Talk Forum. Said that Canikon should make camera phones because that's where the customers were.. I question whether DPR should have a Connect site. They are not experts on handphones. Don't offer a comprehensive analysis of handphones.. "....Actually, there was a hysterical thread in Open Talk Forum. Said that Canikon should make camera phones because that's where the customers were.". "I question whether DPR should have a Connect site. They are not experts on handphones. Don't offer a comprehensive analysis of handphones." - your statement, while true, is irrelevant. DPR reviews cameras in phones only, no one said they look at all "handphones". show us another website that provides an 11-page comprehensive analysis of a phone's camera, and then tell us if you still question Connect's existence.. Thing is that a short review with useful comments is enough for me.. Well, you get general info about phones from all those other sites, and a detailed analysis of the camera capabilities from us. What's bad about that? And what's a handphone? :). happyvan seems to have his knickers in a knot ........... The other sites look pretty detailed and knowledgeable.. DPR has good access to the camera brands and a network of contacts in the camera industry. Does Connect have the same with the phone manufactures, apps developers and mobility pundits?. IMO, the exciting longer term development is large sensor compacts. Once the price comes down, it's going to be hot. You could be networking and reviewing Sony A7 and Nikon A. give me one site that looks at the camera in as much detail as we do, I'd be very interested to have a look at it. Of course our reviews are targeted at the consumers who have a special interest in the camera, everyone else is probably satisfied with what they read on the the phone sites.. And yes, we have good access to phone manufacturers and contacts within this sector. I have personally been working hard on that over the past couple of years and I'd like to think I did a good job :). I like the insights offered by the CNET guy. "Nokia's deep investment in outrageous optics continues in the Lumia 1520. Like other Nokia phones, the 1520 uses Carl Zeiss Optics and the PureView technology that Nokia is associating with its brand. There are ball bearings for effective optical image stabilization, and a dual-LED flash instead of the Xenon flash found in both Verizon's Lumia 928 and in the Lumia 1020.. You'll also find a backside-illuminated sensor and a f/2.4 aperture, 16:9 default aspect ratio, and 26mm focal length.". "I like the insights offered by the CNET guy" - then people like you are grateful that there are sites that cater to your specific intellectual needs. the rest of the world should consider themselves lucky to receive your deep wisdom on how DPR is doing things wrong.. There must be a minority who think that DPR can do no wrong! Hail Mary!. that quote could very well be from the press release. It's a list of specs, nothing else. If you buy your cameras based on specs only, then no, there's no need to read any reviews. If you want to know how the specs and PR blurb translate into real life camera performance, then I am confident our reviews are the best you can find.. "There must be a minority who think that DPR can do no wrong!" - way to go making another irrelevant assertion in an attempt to sidetrack people from watching how your unwarranted criticism gets easily dismantled. I hope that you are right.. Anyway, I started a discussion at Open Talk Forum. Do join in and give us the DPR perspective.. I'm pleased that the discussion has proceeded in a civil manner so far.. There's far more people taking pictures with their phones than with their dedicated cameras. And that gap is only going to get bigger and wider. So I'd say dpreview has made a very astute business move to cover mobile photography and establishing itself in a growing market.. Who knows, perhaps one day the dedicated camera industry might even collapse to the point of being an extreme hobbyist market. When that happens perhaps I might comment at dpreview questioning why is it still wasting precious resources to cater for people like you? ;). I'd much rather trust DPReview on camera review. Not that they could do no wrong, but just reading both review articles you should know which one is more comprehensive and which one is superficial. Although cnet is fond of taking pictures of cute chicks, this is something dpreview really needs to work on.. Raw support in a camera phone? The bell tolls for thee, P&S manufacturers.. Well, that bell tolled some time ago!. What's the point of RAW from 1/2.5 sensor?. It's like wondering what the benefit of RAW is on an APS-C camera shooting at say ISO 1600 to ISO 6400. Noise/detail control, access to fully custom curves, WB, etc.. Without RAW access (had to wait for LR support back then) on my 1/2.5" sensor FZ18, output was so much worse and more limited. And before the usual mantra enters, it can be rewarding/worth it for a phone camera too, because it's often the only camera that is always with you. Not every shot might need RAW or extra processing (time). If you go out and you find yourself having your phone as the only camera with you I don't thing you basically wanted to shoot in RAW, or you would have simply manage to bring your DSLR or dedicated camera.. Most of the time you take pictures with a phone is for unexpected moments, in wich case the picture will always be bad, RAW or not.. The only reason to shoot in RAW is when you are relax and want to take an artistic images, and any good photographer will prefer a real camera.. well, let's say you did not bring your SLR and come across the incredibly, unexpected photo opportunity. I'd love to have Raw on my phone then and be able to optimize the image at home.. It would be an utterly brilliant phone if it ran Android....maybe it will now Microsoft has a new leader?. Any MS CEO putting a Google OS on their smartphone seems pretty wild thinking :). Maybe what Nokia needs to make a breakthrough is some wild thinking?. The deal is almost finished and MS mobile phone unit (ex-Nokia) _IS_ shipping 3 Android phones in Asia.. I wish the Nokia phones would dual-boot Android and Windows Phone. I'd totally buy one of these models if I wasn't taking a risk on Windows but had a choice.. Alternatively, I wish some Android manufacturer would release a reasonable competitor.. It seems like Nokia is hampered by Windows (since otherwise, almost all photographers would buy Nokia), and Windows is hampered by Nokia (who doesn't make the best hardware otherwise). If Microsoft had a strategy of choice on all handsets, it would work better for all involved.. Heck, if I got an Android+Windows phone, I'd at least try Windows. If Windows was better (and I've never used it, so aside from knowing how badly Windows sucks elsewhere, I have no idea), I'd switch to Windows.. I actually think the Windows Phone OS works really well and the tile design is quite nice once you get used to it. It works especially well on the large screen of the 1520. It's really only the app availability that needs some improvement.. It's sooooooo tiring listening the same thing over and over again "it's no Android, so we don't want it". Like listening to 10 yr old kids. At some point you might realise that the WP8 OS is just as good as any out there and actually feels more modern than the rest.. well, yeah it's not bad as an OS but no Snapseed, Pixlr, EyeEm not supported anymore, Instagram in beta etc etc just means that it's not as usueful a tool to mobile photographers, despite arguably the better hardware...which is a real shame.. Fotor is a great and free app. Not a LR alternative maybe, but does many shinny/baby stuff as instagram does.. It's sooooooo tiring listening the same thing over and over again "it is Windows Phone, why don't you try it". Like listening to 10 yr old kids. At some point you might realise that the Android OS is the most complete system out there and actually is more customizable than the rest.. "Android OS is the most complete system out there and actually is more customizable than the rest.". Do you really understand the difference between widgets and Live Tiles?. A family member wanted a smartphone and asked for the simplest one. She basically just wanted to speed dial her friends to start with.... On Windows Phone it was just a matter of uninstalling all the apps from the mobile operator (do that on Android!), then removing all live tiles from the start screen. Then we pinned her 10 favorite contacts to the start screen and finanlly added a manual Phone tile at the top. Presto, speed dial with built in functionality in seconds without downloading any apps. She quickly learned then that the "magical" pinning button in all apps could create livet tiles from any info you have on your screen. Now she pins map locations, favorite songs and friends instagram feeds to her start screen. Again without need for downloading any extra widget apps.... Horrible lack of basic functionality starting from basic copy/paste functions down to having a usable browser on the device (no, IE sucks for power users). And MS is not going to change that, they are not even exposing the full API to 3rd party users to make a decent browser on it.. The bluetooth stack, don't get me started.... 3rd party device support - zilch, zero, zippo.. And MS has stated that WP8 device will not be compatible (fully) with WP9 and that WP8.x phones mostly will not get an upgrade to WP9.. MS already broke most the compatibility with WP7->WP8 transition.. It's not the lack of apps, or bad quality apps, it's the lack of direction, trustworthiness and support of WP as whole.. If MS doesn't change that, they have no chance of succeeding.. Surprised it performs noticeably better than other phones including iPhone 5S which has a similarly sized sensor. My wife wants this phone and I now have no reservation recommending this.. Looking forward to your review on 1020's RAW capability.... BTW, your link to "Page 8: Image Quality Comparison (Bright Light" (and subsequent ones) takes me to a wrong page.. You must be one of the three people following me on twitter :). Actually, the sensor in the iPhone is not the same size as in the Nokia: 1/3" vs 1/2.5". Not a huge difference, but still the Nokia is capturing more light with its bigger sensor.. Sony shows off 3-layer stacked smartphone image sensor that can shoot 1000 fps at 1080p. Apple emphasizes iPhone 7 low light capabilities in "One Night" ad campaign. Apple selling more Plus models than ever. Samsung Galaxy S8 likely to come with same camera specs as S7. Canon EOS M50 first impressions review.

Features Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor, Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 2), Polarizing filter. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features Optical image stabilization, Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features Face detection, Digital zoom, Self-timer, Touch to focus, Geo tagging. Settings Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control.

Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time 27.40 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time 32.0 days (768 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G) 25.10 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern..

GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Home > Phone Reviews >Nokia Lumia 1520. What's Hot: Big full HD IPS display, top notch specs, usual Lumia elegant and unique design.. What's Not: This is a huge phone! Windows app store selection is getting better but still doesn't match Android and IOS selection.. Reviewed December 6, 2013 by Lisa Gade , Editor. in Chief (twitter: @lisagade ). And now for those who want something smaller than the Nokia Lumia 2520 , we have the Nokia Lumia 1520 smartphone, released at the same time as Nokia's first Windows tablet. The Lumia 1520 has a few firsts as well: it's the first Windows phone phablet, the first with a full HD display and the first to sport a quad core processor. Nice! Though the 6" Lumia 1520 might be too big for some, there's no denying the temptations of a Windows Phone that finally competes spec for spec with flagship Android phones. And the Lumia manages to beat most with its 20 megapixel main camera with dual LED flash and Carl Zeiss lens.. The Lumia 1520 is exclusive to AT&T in the US, and it's available in red, black, yellow and white. All have a matte finish except the red that's glossy. We love the red's look, but it is both large and slippery. The black looks very classy and the yellow... well it's a signature color that we loved on the Nokia Lumia 1020. The design language is distinctly Lumia, and that's a good thing because it's unique and pleasingly clean and modern. This is a 7.26 ounce phone, and though it's a little lighter than the notoriously heavy HTC One max, it's still almost as heavy as the Kindle Paperwhite 6" E-Ink eReader. That said, it's more compact than the Paperwhite, thanks in part to the different display aspect ratio, but also because phone makers like Nokia work hard to make even their phablets as compact as possible.. This is a 4G LTE smartphone with 16 gigs of storage and a microSD card slot for storage expansion. The phone runs on a 2.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad core CPU with 2 gigs of RAM and Adreno 330 graphics, making it the fastest Windows 8 phone to date. It should have the necessary specs to receive OS updates for some time to come, though that's up to Nokia and Microsoft (Microsoft now owns Nokia's phone business). The phone has Bluetooth 4.0 and dual band WiFi 802.11ac as well as NFC.. The Nokia Lumia 1520 has a 6" IPS full HD display with glove-friendly touch and Nokia's ClearBlack technology. It's a really lovely display that's viewable outdoors and it has bold and pleasing colors. Windows Phone 8 handles higher resolutions well, though some UI elements seem needlessly large. Live Tiles are sized well and we appreciate the added real estate and number of viewable tiles. The big display makes this feel more like a tablet, and I suspect that's exactly what the target audience (phablet buyers) wants.. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 , HTC One max and Nokia Lumia 1520.. Once you move past the superb display and size of the phone, the 20 megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss lens and dual LED flash steal the show. Granted, it's not as impressive as the Nokia Lumia 1020 and it's 41MP shooter (nothing is), but it's better than most high end camera phones on the market. Like the Lumia 1020, by default it shoots a moderate resolution 5MP image and a full res 19MP image that you can use for print and lossless zooming via crop. Also like the Lumia 1020, shot times could be better, and we have to wonder why a phone with the fastest CPU on the market seems to ponder on each shot. Video is crisp and clear, and we found the camera a more than adequate replacement for a point and shoot when taking photos and shooting video.We particularly appreciate Nokia's OIS (optical image stabilization) in a phone this large and heavy-- there's no need to have perfectly steady hands to shoot smooth full HD video.. I don't think Nokia knows how to make a poor GSM phone when it comes to voice. Call quality is very good for both incoming and outgoing voice, and volume is adequate. Despite the phone's length, we didn't have difficulties aligning both the earpiece and mic during calls; chalk that up to Nokia's good mic system. The rear-firing speakerphone has good volume and should do the job unless you're calling from the Super Bowl during a touchdown. The phone played well with a variety of Bluetooth headsets and speakers and it worked with our BMW's built-in Bluetooth perfectly.. This is a 4G LTE phone with 3G HSPA+ for those times you wander away from AT&T's expansive LTE network. AT&T's data speeds in the Dallas area are always good and the Lumia 1520 averaged 25Mbps down and 16Mbps up on LTE 4G, which is the same we see on other recent AT&T smartphones. As with all recent phones, the Nokia has a mobile hotspot feature so you can use the phone as a high speed wireless modem for your laptop or tablet (note that only certain AT&T data plans offer this service).. The Nokia Lumia 1520 is a very likeable tablet-phone with an excellent display, a stylish design, great call quality and good speed. It has the latest generation hardware inside, making it the first Windows Phone that isn't a step behind flagship Android phones. Windows Phone still lags behind Android and IOS for app selection, but the popular staples are here, including Netflix, Weather Channel and Instagram. If you're a software junky, the platform might not be your best choice, but I suspect there's more than enough here to keep the average user entertained. The basics like MS Office mobile, IE and a solid email client are built in, and the People Hub offers integration with Facebook. If you're after a Windows Phone with the feel of a tablet, the Lumia 1520 won't disappoint. Obviously, it's not meant to be the more mainstream sized Lumia 1020's replacement; this is for the phablet crowd.. Websites: wireless.att.com , www.nokiausa.com.
