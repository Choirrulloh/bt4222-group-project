Which phone has a better camera, Xolo Black or Xiaomi Mi A1?. Answered by Yash Bubna | 11 days ago. Xolo is an indian brand bit lacks in latest technology and uses not so good processor. Its camera quality is not even half as good as mi a1 as it uses dual camera and not only simple dual lense but a 12mp lense with 12 mp telephoto lense that mostly flagship devices use so my opinion is that u should go for mi a1 and its performance is also much much better than xolo black. 3 more answer(s) | Spam?.

I called on One Click Root after my own initial attempt for root bricked my LG G4 (H81010o). If you have a new phone running the latest and more challenging software, then I recommend this service. Technician "JJ" helped me and was a smooth and very capable professional. Rarely do I pay for tech support or make endorsements so purchase with confidence, these folks are legit!. Just had a fantastic experience during an expert session to root my phone with Virgil! Honestly, appreciate his patience, problem solving skills along with his willingness to help. Really looking forward to use this software moving on, and definitely recommending to others. I had a great experience with JJ helping me to root my phone. The Samsung Galaxy S4 is a hard phone to root and took a few attempted, but everything worked out. Just wanted to say thank you very much to JJ, he spent several hours wrestling with my tablet, was polite throughout, helpful, informative and wouldn't give up. A credit to his employers, and should be given a pat on the back, well done ð. JJ and everyone at this company (Sean, Camille, Michelle, Alex) are AWESOME!!!!! Thanks so much for your help!!!.

Waste of Money & chances of getting cheated from service stations due to no spares available.. By Anirudh Tapase | 2 Oct 2015. The most sad thing is there is no service center near by. Takes more than a month to get repaired. Staff at service station is rude and uses duplicate parts (my experience at Suraj Enterprises, Pune, Maharashtra) due to unavailability of original spares. My Q700 got damaged within couple of months after changing display & touchscreen. The worst is the support guys are not helpful at all. Please don't buy any Xolo phone in India, The spares are not available too. It is waste of your valuable money. Go for other makes which has max. service stations and spares available easily. No ratting & no recommendation for XOLO mobiles.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 2 out of 2 people found this review helpful.

Was this review helpful? Yes No. Not Worth to buy this Brand.. By Ashutosh Srivastava | 20 Sep 2015. The phone is not worth of its price. I have used the phone for more than 30 days and following are my observations:. 1) Performance is VERY BAD for normal usage.Phone get HANG most of the time despite having 2 GB RAM and Snapdragon Processor... 2) Rear and front cameras are just OK. DUAL CAMERA is NOT working at all.. 3) battery backup is OK if you use with cautions. 4) Phone looks premium that's the only specialty of XOLO BLACK. Back glass is smooth and feels good in hands but is made of VERY LOW QUALITY GLASS getting lots of scratches and smudge despite being made of Gorilla GLASS and Oleophobic Coating. 6) Gets heat up in normal usage like playing games and using whats app facebook and also during charging.. 7) HIVE UI still needs to be developed much more. It cannot match the competitors out there. 8) No Updates Came yet as they were releasing Android 5.1.1 in August but still there is no update for XOLO BLACK.. I Should say that its waste of money. better to buy another brand as so many brands available now in this range with better features and better Quality.. Was this review helpful?

Which phone has a better camera, Xolo Black or Xiaomi Mi A1?. Answered by Yash Bubna | 11 days ago. Xolo is an indian brand bit lacks in latest technology and uses not so good processor. Its camera quality is not even half as good as mi a1 as it uses dual camera and not only simple dual lense but a 12mp lense with 12 mp telephoto lense that mostly flagship devices use so my opinion is that u should go for mi a1 and its performance is also much much better than xolo black. 3 more answer(s) | Spam?.

XOLO Black 3GB - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 Â». if you wanna to purchase xolo products. they have some never be resolved like overheating, camera can't work in zoom mode, fast charging not working, photo click by these products is not too good and the worst think due to overheating problem these xolo products dead with in 2 years or less and you are a game lover then forget to chose xolo or his sister concern lava. very very bad phone and bad after service. Abhishek, 16 Oct 2016 worst phone ever, don't buy this phone ..every month I have to go service centre and very poor... more you are clearly a faker...or noob...no phone takes 8hrs to charge fully...moreover it supports quick charging.... it charges fully in 90minutes....the phone is very good...unless you don't know how to use a phone properly.... Since a year i'm using this phone. I selected Xolo black 3gb RAM because of SNAPDRAGON Processor. Iam able to produce DSLR like camera features with its rear dual camera. One has to know is right settings. This has good camera module with 120fps capability at low resolution 640p. No one should blame anything without knowing settings tweaking. In my Opinion Manufacturer just manufactures with some features but using them/selecting them in a right way with right settings is the best thing to be done in firstplace. This had Glonass GPS, GYRO, Compass interlinked which are costlier but got at a low price. No screen gaurd used NO scratches on front/back GORILLA Glass3. I think this is the best phone to be selected at such a low cost. MY REVIEW MAY HELP ONLY THOSE WHO DESERVE STANDARD LIFE STYLE. sangmasaon, 20 Oct 2016 I want to know whether xolo black 3gb supports reliance Jio sim or not ?????????? Jio sport yes. sangmasaon, 20 Oct 2016 I want to know whether xolo black 3gb supports reliance Jio sim or not ?????????? I use xolo black 3g last 2months. In this phone jio 4g sport..

Oops the reason you can't connect to wifi is that you don't know how to use it. I want to know whether xolo black 3gb supports reliance Jio sim or not ??????????. Abhishek, 16 Oct 2016 worst phone ever, don't buy this phone ..every month I have to go service centre and very poor... more Oh really? do you REALLY have to go to the service Centre EVERY month and CAN you? I guess not! This is a clear fake complain! XOLO Service Centres take not less than 3-4 Weeks to repair and you manage to get repair every month and SPOL it AGAIN? Maybe you have something good and wrong with you (if the comment is genuine). worst phone ever, don't buy this phone ..every month I have to go service centre and very poor service of xolo company... All stafs behavior of xolo service centre is very bad ........ battery backup too low...screen pining and takes 8 hours to full charge ........In my opinion I want to say xolo should not make any smartphone because they have no capability to give service to customers. This is the best phone which I am using from last 9 months. Display & camera quality is best one. Only issue is memory card slot not avl. The product sucks..Battery gets heated, Hive interface is useless, camera quality is bad front and rear both, phones hangs also a lot... the only plus point is that u can call which u can also do with a normal landline also... My suggesstion....dont even consider to give a second thougt of buying this phone. Xolo black is the best mobile i am huge fan xolo black 3gb. can anyone suggest a different rom for this mobile. XOLO sucks useless hive interface and I am sure it is such a useless mobile that I will never get update. Pages: 1 2 3 Â». Total of 48 user reviews and opinions for XOLO Black 3GB ..

Rating: 3.8/5 out of 299 Reviews. Xolo Black is a good example of the companyâs focus on aesthetics. Firstly launched with 2GB of RAM, the company now has a 3GB variant as well. The main selling point of this phone is the dual cameras which are now a common feature. Xolo Black 3GB which is priced at INR 11999, comes with Gorilla glass 3. Although this is supposed to protect the device, we found it very delicate and easily breakable. Coming to the good news, the phone comes with a dual rear camera setup. With one 13MP and one 2MP camera, the phone lets you take pictures with more than one focus points. One can also change the focus after clicking the picture. The rear camera comes with a ChromaFlash for enhanced colors in low light. The front shooter is a 5MP unit that also comes with a flash. Internal memory is 16GB which is quite a surprise for us. Overall, this time Xolo has concentrated on all traits of a device and no card is unattended. It is definitely a good buy.. Xolo Black is a good example of the companyâs focus on aesthetics.
