When is a great screen, strong performance, a fine camera and a desirable design not enough in a smartphone? When it comes with a ludicrous price tag, like the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design.. Fingerprint sensor = fiddly home button. Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design price My other phone’s a Porsche Very different to the standard Mate 9 Flagship specs - but you're largely paying for the branding Design and display Beautiful curved-glass and metal design Punchy 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED display Fingerprint scanner is not always responsive as a home button. The Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design is like a concept car, intended to illustrate one possible idealized path for the world’s third biggest smartphone maker, as it strives to close the cachet gap with Samsung and Apple. Unfortunately, it seems to be a bit of an evolutionary dead end.. Huawei sells a ridiculous number of phones in China - the world’s largest smartphone market, and 2015’s Nexus 6P showed that it could stand up to the very best premium smartphone makers in the world for pure hardware quality.. While the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design is a beautiful phone that shares several the Nexus 6P’s core attributes, however, it’s an impossible phone to recommend to all but a very select group.. Weight : 169g Dimensions : 152 x 75 x 7.5mm OS : Android 7 Screen size : 5.5-inch Resolution : 2560 x 1440 CPU : Kirin 960 octa-core RAM : 6GB Storage : 256GB Battery : 4,000mAh Rear camera : 20MP + 12MP Front camera : 8MP. At €1,395 (around £1,200, $1,500, AU$2,000), it’s an astonishingly overpriced indulgence that’s only really suitable for brand addicts and those who revel in exclusivity.. Of course, with availability restricted to the Porsche Design website and stores around the world, and with no official launch in sight for the US, it’s pretty clear that this is precisely the rarified market the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design is being targeted at.. The question, then, isn’t simply whether the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design is a good phone (spoiler alert: it is). It’s whether the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design offers something better than premium phones at half the price.. The key selling point for the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design, and the thing that’s being used to justify that huge price, is right there in the name. This is a joint venture between manufacturer Huawei and Porsche Design.. You might wonder why someone would slap a car brand on a smartphone, but Porsche Design doesn’t just deal in Porsche-branded tat, but rather dabbles with industrial design in the fields of fashion, kitchenware, timepieces, and yes - electronics.. This isn’t even the first Porsche-branded handset - phone fanatics will doubtless recall the work done with BlackBerry, such as the BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9982 .. As a result of this, the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design is actually a very different beast to the regular Huawei Mate 9. We’d argue that it’s a completely different phone, with surprisingly few shared components.. Everything from the size, resolution, and design of the display to the positioning of the phone’s fingerprint scanner is different. Internally, while the processor is the same as the vanilla Mate 9’s, it’s bolstered by 50% more RAM and packed out with four times the storage.. We’ll go into the specifics of each point in due course, but the point is this: you really are paying for a unique phone here rather than a lazily rebadged Huawei Mate 9.. Of course, when you look at the price differential, you’d jolly well hope there’d be some major differences. The normal Huawei Mate 9 costs €699 (around £620, $775, AU$1,000), which is half the price of its swanky brother.. Included in the Porsche Design’s price you get a snazzy box and a bundled-in folio case, that has a long plastic window running up the right-hand third of the front flap.. The phone’s AMOLED display readjusts to show the time, date and weather widget and the number of steps you’ve taken that day - but it’s not always-on, and it’s a little dim for outdoor use.. The case itself is a curious thing - simultaneously premium (with a leathery finish) and cheap-feeling (it’s a little flimsy). But it’s a welcome addition nonetheless. It occurred to us on more than one occasion that we were carrying something enormously expensive around in our jacket pocket, so having the option of a case straight out of the box is a good thing.. One of the more distinctive elements of the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design is the Leica-branded camera it shares with the plain Mate 9 and the Huawei P9 before it.. This uses a rather unique dual-lens setup that takes a very different approach to, say, Apple’s. Rather than playing on the difference in focal length like the iPhone 7 Plus , here the point is that there’s one color sensor and one monochrome sensor, which combine to create more detailed images.. We’ll discuss whether this yields results in the camera section, but it’s certainly a distinctive element - and arguably a more meaningful brand partnership than the one with Porsche Design.. We don’t know the full extent of Porsche Design’s influence on the look and feel of the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design. The recently announced Huawei Mate 9 Pro seems to be a debadged Mate 9 Porsche Design with a slightly different finish, so it may not be that pronounced. Either way, this is undoubtedly a handsome phone.. The old joke about Porsche cars is that they tend to look exactly like the previous model, but the same accusation can’t be levelled here. Huawei has never built a device quite like this before.. From the front it’s an inky black monolith of a thing, with the stand-out feature being the way the left and right edges curve away into the all-metal body. That metal rear section has a matt, brushed effect that combines with the Graphite Black color to give of a sort of diffused reflection. It also seems to show off dirt and grubby fingerprints to a chronic degree.. There isn’t an inch of plastic on display here, with just a couple of subtle antenna lines towards the top and bottom of the phone’s rear side.. It sits nicely in the hand, and there’s a reassuring heft to its 169g weight - despite being a relatively slim 7.5mm.. We wouldn’t say that the Mate 9 Porsche Design is wholly original. We’ve seen those curved edges on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the BlackBerry Priv , while the rear of the phone calls to mind any number of well-built Android devices from the OnePlus 3 to the HTC 10 .. The matt metal rim with its bevelled edges and drilled-hole speaker (alongside a USB-C charging port) is another Samsung-like touch, as is the lozenge-like home key.. Not that the latter is actually a physical button here. Rather, this is a combined fingerprint sensor and capacitive home button. The Huawei Mate 9 had this positioned on the back of the phone.. This represents a major difference between the two Mate 9 devices, and we prefer the approach here, as the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design’s fingerprint sensor is more accessible in more situations.. In general use you’ll use either the thumb of your holding hand or the forefinger of your other hand to unlock your phone, while you can also gain access when it’s lying flat on a table. Just try any of that with a rear-mounted equivalent.. In use, the Mate 9 Porsche Design’s home button has mixed benefits. It’s an extremely fast and reliable fingerprint sensor, but we found it to be a less-than-satisfactory home button.. A few times when we were in an app and wanted to jump back to the home screen we would touch the home key and nothing would happen. So we’d press again, and this time hold a little longer - at which point the Google Now on Tap function would activate.. We don’t know if this is a hardware issue or a problem with Huawei’s Emotion UI - we suspect the latter. You learn to live with it and work around it, but this is a lot less acceptable in a phone that costs approaching twice as much as an entry-level iPhone 7 Plus or a Google Pixel XL with their flawless inputs.. The Mate 9 Porsche Design’s curved 5.5-inch QHD display is an absolute treat to look at regardless of comparisons. But stack it next to the Huawei Mate 9’s 5.9-inch, 1080p LCD display, and you’ll see that it’s a completely different beast.. There's a massive improvement in sharpness here. You could argue that the larger Mate 9 display would have benefitted more from all those extra pixels, but the main strength of the Porsche Design model’s screen isn’t in its sharpness.. It’s the fact that it’s a very crisp AMOLED display with colors that are punchy without being unnatural or garish, and none of the yellowy-red whites that used to plague AMOLED displays.. Even if you do find the picture too warm (or too cold for that matter), you can fine-tune it using Huawei’s powerful built-in color temperature tool.. Of course, you can get a display that’s at least as good as this from the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge for half the price. But in terms of Huawei phones, this marks a welcome return to the QHD AMOLED technology of the Nexus 6P.. There’s also the fact that Huawei looks set to release its own Daydream VR headset in 2017, which should make full use of the Porsche Design’s pixel-dense display.. Next Page What's it like to use?.

Huawei Mate 9 & Porsche Design Mate 9 review. by Nirave Gondhia December 20, 2016. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Compact size for a large phone. Porsche Design Mate 9 has a great display. Dual camera can take stunning photos. EMUI 5 is a polished interface. Porsche Design Mate 9 is expensive. EMUI 5 still has a few quirks. "Only" a Full HD screen on regular Mate 9. The Mate 9 brings a familiar design with more powerful internals, a clever dual camera and a revamped software experience. The result is an excellent big-screen Android smartphone that is easily Huawei's best ever.. Throughout six weeks of testing, weâve experienced screen on time ranging from 5 to 8 hours, whereas the Porsche Design Mate 9 achieves between 4 and 7 hours. For the most part, six hours of screen on time is regularly achievable for heavy users. Whether youâre a heavy, medium or light user, the Mate 9 will power you for days on end. Battery life is a problem that plagues all smartphone users and both variants of the Huawei Mate 9 are excellent solutions to this long-running concern with modern technology.Â. progressed as fast as other areas of smartphone tech, butÂ. with the Mate 9 Huawei proves that flagships can have lasting battery lives.. Overall, the camera on the Mate 9 certainly doesnât disappoint and it seems to be on par with other Android flagships. In particular, the improvement in the camera performance from pre-release to final software was drastic enough for us to change our thoughts on the camera; initially, there were several issues, especially in low light, but these are no longer a concern with the final update. Itâs not perfect â no phone is after all â but the Mate 9 takes gorgeous photos that youâll be proud to share.. Overall, EMUI 5 feels more polished than previousÂ. generations and with a lot of features built-in like Samsung’s TouchWiz, it may yet serve as the next best alternative to the Galaxy Note 7.Â. From EMUI 4 to EMUI 5, Huawei shows just how much can be achieved by listening to customer feedback. The result are clear to see: EMUI 5 is smooth, feature-rich and easilyÂ.

The spectacular failure of the Galaxy Note 7 earlier this year has presented an opportunity for companies to create the best big-screen Android alternative and Samsungâs misfortune could play right into the hands of Chinese OEM Huawei.16. Huaweiâs Mate range dates back nearly as long as Samsungâs Note series and by offering metal unibody designs, large displays and fantastic battery life, the range has grown in popularity. The Mate 9 continues this trend with better internals, a large display and an upgraded version of the P9âs LEICA dual camera setup but, crucially, it also brings a major revamp to Huaweiâs EMUI interface in the form of EMUI 5.. Alongside the regular Mate 9, Huawei also announced the first device in its partnership with Porsche Design â aptly named the Porsche Design Mate 9 â which brings the same internals coupled with a curved QHD display, 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The Porsche Design Mate 9 is limited edition and with a price tag of â¬1399, itâs definitely not for everyone.. Is the Mate 9, in either form, the perfect smartphone for those wanting a big-screen Android experience? Letâs find out in this, our Huawei Mate 9 review.. About this review: Weâve been using the Huawei Mate 9 and Porsche Design Mate 9 for around five weeks now as our main phone. Until early December, both handsets were running pre-release firmware and while some of our impressions were based on the non-final software, weâve retested both phones on their latest software for this review.. All reviews published prior to November 30th 2016 were based on the non-final software and weâve noticed several âissuesâ in this build have been fixed in the latest software. Throughout this review, weâll be referencing these improvements and tweaks as a reference point against issues raised in other reviews.. The design of the Mate 9 isnât really surprising as itâs largely unchanged from last year, although Huawei has made it a little more compact and ergonomically friendly. Alongside this, Huawei has also added a curved unibody finished with soft-feeling aluminium and the result is a smartphone that doesnât feel as large as youâd expect.. Considering thereâs a 5.9-inch display, you could be forgiven for thinking the Mate 9 is a big phone and while the display is certainly large, narrow vertical bezels and a slim profile mean it handles a lot better than other large devices. Compared to the Google Nexus 6P or the iPhone 7 Plus, the Mate 9 is infinitely easier to handle and use, despite the larger display.. To the right of the Mate 9 youâve got the power and volume keys while on the left is the dual-SIM tray. On the bottom is a USB-C port and one of the dual speakers, while the headphone jack and infrared port can be found up top. Huawei has also added brushed patterns and a slight chamfer to the edges which adds grip, improves the handling and makes the Mate 9 more ergonomically friendly.. On the back, youâve got a dual-camera arrangement in a vertical layout, rather than the horizontal layout found in the Huawei P9. Beneath this is Huaweiâs typical fingerprint sensor which, in typical fashion, remains one of the fastest on the market. Rather interestingly â considering Huaweiâs habit of mentioning the iPhone camera bump during its press conferences â the camera is on a slightly raised hump, although this does sit flush when you use the case supplied in the box.. Although the Mate 9 is a good looking smartphone, the Porsche Design Mate 9 is Huaweiâs real design champion and whether itâs a sign of things to come â or a game of imitation â itâs definitely a looker. Almost all the design elements have been changed; rather than a regular display, youâve got a dual-curved screen like the one found on the Galaxy S7 Edge.. The design changes donât just stop there; the screen is smaller than the Mate 9 (more on that later), the fingerprint sensor is moved to the front beneath the display and flanked by back and recent keys and the back is covered in a pitch-black anodized metal that looks striking and shimmers in the light.. The curved display itself is surprising as itâs incredibly subtle and more an element of design rather than a feature in itself. The different finish on the rear also means the Porsche Design Mate 9 attracts more fingerprints but is easier to hold and provides a hard edge to grab a hold of, and more grip than the regular Mate 9.. Rather than a revolutionary design, the Mate 9 is another step in the evolution of Huaweiâs design strategy. that big doesn’t always have to feel Â. big, and that they can pull off a large display that’s still friendly to your hand. Personally, while the Porsche Design Mate 9 is definitely a looker, I prefer the feel of the regular Mate 9 in the hand.. Huawei is demonstrating that big doesn't always have to feel big, and that they can pull off a large display that's still friendly to your hand.. The Huawei Mate 9 sports a 5.9-inch 2.5D Full HD IPS display with a density of ~373ppi, while the Porsche Design brings Quad HD resolution in a smaller 5.5-inch AMOLED display with ~534ppi density.. You could be forgiven for judging the regular Mate 9 purely on the Full HD resolution but to do so would take away from the fact the display is fantastic. Like previous Huawei devices, thereâs a super high contrast ratio (1600:1+) which offers an immersive experience and helps to shield the fact itâs not an AMOLED display.. Running both devices through our testing reveals both have a cool display out of the box – with the Porsche Design more accurate than the regular Mate 9 – although this can be easily changed in the settings menu. Like most flagships, both devices also come with a blue-light filter, which is branded as âEye Comfortâ mode and works just as youâd expect by changing the display tone to a much warmer color. Digging further and the Porsche Design Mate 9 has a max brightness of 383 nits, while the Mate 9 tops out at over 600 nits.. The Porsche Design Mate 9 aside, Huawei has always stuck to its guns when it came to adopting higher resolutions and the Mate 9 screen goes to show that you donât always need more than Full HD. Yes, it would have been nice to have better than Full HD resolution on the regular Mate 9 but this display is fantastic regardless.. As you might expect, the Mate 9 is packed with the latest internals from Huawei in the form of the Kirin 960 chipset, which is made up of ARMâs latest Cortex-A73 chipset (versus the A72 used in the Mate 8 and Huawei P9). The Kirin 960 comes equipped with four Cortex-A73 âperformanceâ cores clocked at 2.4GHz, paired with four Cortex-A53 lower power cores clocked at 1.8GHz. The Mate 9 is also the first handset to run the new 8-core Mali-G71 MP8 GPU, which is expected to power the Galaxy S8 and other flagship devices next year.. The regular Mate 9 comes equipped with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB of storage, while Porsche Design Mate 9 owners will get 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. If you do opt for the regular Mate 9, you do get expandable storage, while the Porsche Design Mate 9 is limited to 256GB of storage.. The combination of the latest processing package, ample amounts of RAM and lightning fast UFS 2.1 storage means both versions of the Mate 9 fly through everything you throw at it. On the regular Mate 9, thereâs between 2.4GB and 2.6GB of RAM free with no apps running and even with 20 apps running (including a couple of games), weâre yet to hit below 1.5GB of RAM free. Based on the RAM utilization, the Mate 9 is the closest weâve seen a smartphone come to PC-levels of optimization and resource usage.. The Mate 9 is the closest weâve seen a smartphone come to PC-levels of optimization and resource usage.. A large part of this is down to Huaweiâs new machine learning algorithm, which learns your habits and prioritises your favourite apps to ensures thereâs always the right resources available when you need them. Huawei goes a step further to say that their machine learning algorithm means your phone is fast out of the box and remains fast, even after months of usage. Of course, we canât confirm this but so far, the results are certainly promising.. How do both versions of the Mate 9 stack up to the competition and how much better is the Kirin 960 than the Kirin 950? In AnTuTu, the regular Mate 9 scores 127507 while the Porsche Design Mate 9 scores 111354. In comparison, last yearâs Mate 8 scores 51432, the Exynos-8890 powered Galaxy S7 Edge scores 127507 and the Snapdragon 821-powered Pixel XL scores 136883.. Moving on to GeekBench 4 and the results are quite similar; the regular Mate 9 scores 1910 in the single-core test and 5311 in the multi-core test while the Porsche Design Mate 9 scores 1936 and 5921 respectively. By way of comparison, the Mate 8 scores 1070 and 1787, the Galaxy S7 Edge scores 1578 and 3858, and the Pixel XL scores 1575 and 4090. Interestingly in the multi-core test, the regular Mate 9 is the first Android smartphone weâve tested thatâs on par with the iPhone 7 Plus (5395) while the Porsche Design Mate 9 leads the field comfortably.. The last of our regular benchmark tests is 3DMark, where we put the new GPU to the test and the regular Mate 9 scored 2203 on the Slingshot test, while the Porsche Design Mate 9 scores 1600. By way of comparison, the Mate 8 scores just 351, the Galaxy S7 Edge scores 2178 and the Pixel XL scores 2476.. To test the GPU further, we also ran another graphics-based benchmark (which weâll be doing more of in 2017) in the form of GFX Bench. In the T-Rex HD on-screen test, the regular Mate 9 achieved 58 frames per second (fps), while in the Manhattan on-screen test, it scored 28fps. Meanwhile, in the same tests, there was quite a drop in the Porsche Design Mate 9 results at 41fps and 20fps, which is not overly surprising given the higher resolution and extra pixels the GPU has to power. By way of comparison, the Mate 8 scores just 39fps and 17fps, the Galaxy S7 Edge scores 50fps and 14fps and the Pixel XL scores 55fps and 30fps.. Overall, the benchmark results show how much the Kirin 960 has improved over previous versions, especially in the graphics department, where the Mali GPU has almost completely closed the gap to the Adreno GPU used in Snapdragon chipsets. On paper, the Kirin 960 may not be perceived as one of the best chipsets, but the experience on the Mate 9 is almost as smooth as the Pixel XL.. Like most flagship handsets, the Mate 9 comes equipped with the latest internals, including an array of sensor, a fingerprint sensor, and connectivity options. Huawei also demonstrates its network infrastructure prowess through the addition of smart WiFi features, excellent antennae and full control over dual SIM functionality.. Beneath the camera on the rear, the regular Mate 9 has a lightning fast fingerprint sensor, in the same vein of those weâve come to expect from Huawei. It takes around half a dozen taps to register your fingerprint and once enrolled, you can wake and unlock your phone in under a second. The fingerprint sensor also comes with gesture support, allowing you to tap once to go back a step, press and hold to return to the home screen and swipe down to access your notifications and shortcuts.. On the Porsche Design Mate 9, the fingerprint sensor is moved to the front of the device with the rear sensor replaced by a Porsche Design logo. The fingerprint sensor works almost as well as on the regular Mate 9, although there does seem to be a slightly longer delay in reading your fingerprint when the display is turned off. This sensor also supports gestures, albeit they are different to the regular Mate 9 and if you opt to switch off the capacitive navigation keys, youâll use swipe-based gestures on the sensor to navigate between screens.. The Mate 9 comes with a dual stereo speaker setup with a single speaker found on the bottom and a secondary speaker built into the earpiece above the display. The speakers are fantastic and louder than youâll ever need them to be, but when set to above 60%, there is a noticeable tininess to the audio. However, you probably wonât need to set it to higher than this as itâs plenty loud without distortion for general usage.. Unlike many smartphones, the Mate 9 keeps the regular 3.5mm headphone jack, which can be found up top. The design might be questionable – I personally prefer a bottom mounted headphone jack â but the wired audio output isnât, with the Mate 9 able to drive ample amounts of power to a variety of headphones. Itâs not quite on par with audio-centric smartphones such as the LG V20 and ZTE Axon 7 but it comes very close and offers one of the best audio experiences on a flagship smartphone.. Like most flagships, the Mate 9 offers a plethora of connectivity options that include NFC, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and an infrared port. Itâs especially great to see that Huawei kept the infrared port, which can be used to control your home appliances and entertainment. The dual SIM card slot allows you to use either two SIMs or a SIM card and microSD card (on the regular Mate 9 that is) and call quality is fantastic, especially as when you put the phone to your ear during a call, the Mate 9 eliminates ambient noise. This, coupled with the speaker in the earpiece, results in excellent call quality.. One of the principle cornerstones of Huaweiâs smartphone philosophy is battery life and in particular, a desire to prioritize battery life over features (such as higher resolution displays).. The Mate 9 is no different and its 4,000mAh battery is one of the largest found on an Android flagship smartphone. Coupled with a Full HD display, you get excellent battery life as you might expect from such a large battery. By way of comparison however, the Porsche Design Mate 9 has a higher resolution (yet smaller) display and the same 4,000mAh battery capacity and there is a noticeable drop in battery life.. How does the battery stack up to the competition? Using our custom battery tester app, weâre able to say that the battery life on both devices is firmly up there with the best smartphones on the market.. The first of our tests focuses on gaming and each smartphone is charged to 100 percent, the display brightness is set to 200 nits and all sync is turned off (with Wi-Fi remaining on). During this test, the Mate 9 lasted 5 hours and 12 minutes, while Porsche Design lasted 4 hours and 34 minutes. By way of comparison, the Mate 8 lasts 4 hours and 48 minutes and the Pixel XL lasts 4 hours and 43 minutes. Our testing has revealed that no Android smartphone comes close to the iPhone 7 Plus, which lasts for 12 hours and 37 minutes when gaming.. Moving onto the next criteria and we use the same 1080p HD video file, charge phones to full and loop the video until the battery drains completely. In this test, the Mate 9 lasts for 14 hours and 12 minutes, while the Porsche Design lasts for 10 hours and 36 minutes. By way of comparison, the Mate 8 lasts for 10 hours and 34 minutes and the Pixel XL lasts for just over 7 hours.. Our last battery test focuses on wifi browsing and our apps loads the same six webpages in a continuous loop until the battery drains completely. In this test, the Huawei Mate 9 lasts for 14 hours and 4 minutes, while the Porsche Design lasts for 11 hours and 28 minutes. By way of comparison, the Mate 8 lasts for 11 hours and 57 minutes and the Pixel XL for 10 hours and 38 minutes.. Huawei has often claimed that it resisted the market transition to Quad HD displays because of the effect on battery life and as our testing has revealed, the QHD display on the Porsche Design Mate 9 has an impact on the battery life, when compared to the FHD display on the regular Mate 9.Â. With that being said however, both smartphones offer exceptional battery life and even with heavy usage, neither device fails to last for more than a day. On several occasions, the 4000mAh unit has been enough to see us through the entirety of the second day, and sometimes, even half of the third.. With the Mate 9 Huawei proves that flagships can have lasting battery lives.. For the times when the battery is running low, the Mate 9 and Porsche Design Mate 9 are the first handsets to come equipped with Huawei SuperCharge, a proprietary fast charging solution that’s designed to rival Qualcomm’s QuickCharge and other OEM solutions. Charging the 4,000 mAh battery inside the Mate 9 is incredibly fast using the bundled SuperCharge charger (either the wall or the car charger), with the battery taking around 90 minutes to charge from full. How does this compare to the competition though?. Huawei claims its new 4.5V/5A charging technology is also designed to be cooler than rival fast charging solutions, and in a direct dig at Samsung, says a processor inside the charger communicates with your phone, continuously monitors the temperature of your Mate 9 and will slow charging down if it notices the handset is overheating. Below 50 percent, it charges rapidly and once it gets to 75%, the charging process slows a little. On the lock screen, the Mate 9 shows whether you’re charging at standard, “fast”Â. while it’s not slated to work with rival fast charging solutions, the Mate 9 does charge quicker than normal when plugged into a QuickCharge 3.0 charger.. Huaweiâs partnership with Leica continues with the Mate 9 sporting a new and improved second generation dual camera setup. Much like the one in the Huawei P9, the camera is centred around a Leica-branded dual camera, with a 12MP RGB sensor supplemented by a 20MP monochrome sensor. Both sensors are behind lenses with f/2.2 aperture and the RGB sensor also sports Optical Image Stabilisation for additional stability in photos and videos.. Like the P9, the RGB sensor captures the colors in a scene while the monochrome sensor enhances the detail and this means the Mate 9 is capable of capturing images with a very impressive bokeh effect.Â. In the right conditions, youâre able to take images that top the same effect found in the iPhone 7 Plus and the photo sphere feature found on the Pixel XL.. Overall, image quality from the Mate 9âs dual camera array has been impressive. In daylight, you get images that are crisp, full of detail with colors that are more realistic (and less saturated) than those captured by the Galaxy S7 Edge or Pixel XL.. Huaweiâs camera app means Pro mode is just a tap away and offers settings to adjust the exposure, ISO and focal point to take stunning photos. In the default mode, the Mate 9 seems to struggle with picking the right focal point (images are often under or over exposed) but manually selecting the right focal point or tweaking the scene in Pro mode allows you to take fantastic photos.. One of the biggest improvements in the final software build is the low light performance of the camera, with the Mate 9 now capable of taking low light pictures that are on par with the Galaxy S7 Edge. However, while low light shots are vastly improved, the Mate 9 does struggle with slight movement in low-light, with OIS proving less effective than in other flagship devices.. The Huawei camera app is rather straight forward to use, with options for flash, wide aperture and filters found in the viewfinder. A swipe to the right brings up the settings menu, while camera modes such as monochrome (black and white), Beauty, slow-mo, panorama, light painting and HDR can be found by swiping to the right.. HDR mode in particular is interesting as thereâs no way to enable it by default or have it automatically turn on so youâll need to remember to activate it by swiping left. The Mate 9 does activate HDR automaticallyÂ. in certain conditions, but hiding it in the modes menu means itâs less user-friendly than on other smartphones. HDR does a decent job of boosting colors, reducing blowouts and brightening shadows, but the effect is less pronounced than on other smartphones and the difference is minimal enough that you wonât activate HDR as much as you might with another Android device.. Moving to video and the Mate 9 is capable of shooting 4k video at 30 frames per second and like in photos, video quality is decent in daylight, but becomes a little grainy in low light. The Mate 9 is one of the first phones to shoot 4k using the new h.265 codec, but given itâs so new, very few apps (including YouTube) know what to do with it. Although thereâs ample storage on the Mate 9, Huaweiâs compression algorithm means 4k video file sizes are up to 50% lower than on other devices. The Mate 9 also supports shooting in 1080p at 60 frames per second (where you get software-based stabilisation) and 720p video at 120 frames per second for slow-motion footage.. The front camera on the Mate 9 is an 8MP sensor with f/1.9 aperture lens, capable of shooting Full HD video at 30 frames per second. For the most part, selfies come out rich and full of colors in good lighting and in low light, the camera does a good job at boosting the ISO and letting more light into the camera.. Huawei Mate 9 & Porsche Design Mate 9 camera samples. However, a very irritating part of taking low light selfies is the amount of time it takes the camera to actually take a photo. When the flash is set to auto (thereâs no way to keep it on by default) and thereâs not enough light, the screen lights up for two to three seconds before the camera fires. Unfortunately, most selfie takers wonât hold a pose for that long (especially as the screen can be quite blinding at full brightness), and especially not when taking a group selfie, resulting in selfies that have motion blur. This does seem to be a software-based issue so hopefully this will be resolved in the next update.. The Mate 9 takes gorgeous photos that youâll be proud to share. Look at past Huawei phones and thereâs a single trend that has defined the companyâs smartphone efforts to now: hardware is always great but poor software. Like most Chinese OEMs, Huawei used to develop its global software in China, without taking into consideration how different the Chinese market is from, well, everywhere else.. Earlier this year, we heard that Huawei was working on a revamped version of its EMUI interface, that would look to address a lot of the issues raised in previous reviews. In the Mate 9 we have just that, with EMUI 5 bringing the latest Android 7.0 Nougat OS as well as several fixes to issues that have plagued Huawei smartphones for generations.. With that out of the way, whatâs new with EMUI 5? Thereâs a lot of changes, starting with the new Azure color scheme thatâs present throughout the UI. It brings with it a complete visual overhaul, with the odd color scheme of old replaced by white backgrounds, faint grey accents and blue highlights and tones. The changes donât end there as Huaweiâs own stock apps adopt more of Googleâs Material Design guidelines and the icons no longer look like out-of-place and inspired by iOS.. The biggest new feature of all? An app drawer. It sounds so simple, but finally EMUI brings the option for an app drawer in the settings. Itâs not enabled by default – and when it is activated, there seems to be a one second lag before the home screen shows when you return from an app – but the app drawer brings the familiar Android interface, and vastly improves the overall user experience.. The result is a familiar software experience chiseled and refined into something closer to the bone of Android.. Android 7.0 Nougat also brings some improvements and tweaks that lend to the overall experience and itâs refreshing to see that Huawei has resisted previous habits of overhauling everything. Instead, EMUI 5 brings tweaks to the stock Android experience with Huawei showing flair and tweaks in selected locations rather than throughout the OS. The result is a familiar software experienceÂ. chiseled and refined into something closer to the bone of Android.. Swiping down from the top brings a new, darker notification shade that displays more icons than before and can be heavily customised. In the settings menu, thereâs an option to toggle between individual notification icons in the top bar or the total number of unread notifications. For the data-driven type of user, thereâs also the option to display the current network speed – surprisingly useful at diagnosing when you have connectivity issues â as well as the carrier name, which is useful to distinguish between carriers when youâre using two SIM cards.. Moving further around EMUI 5 and one thing is clear; this is a rapid interface, with bloatware â on the global version at least â kept to a minimum. The few preloaded apps can generally be uninstalled, save for a few that Huawei uses to provide core EMUI f5 features. The launcher is fast, full of features and heavily customisable and aside from the aforementioned slight stutter when you have the app drawer enabled, there is no noticeable lag. Although the launcherâs color scheme is pleasant and usable, if itâs not for you, there are plenty of themes available in Huaweiâs theme store, although these wonât change the look and feel of Huaweiâs own default apps.. During a briefing on EMUI 5 in China, Huawei revealed that EMUI 5 had been redesigned to ensure most tasks were only a couple of taps away. The exact figures they quote are being able to reach 50% of features within two taps and over 92% within three taps and nowhere is this more noticeable than in the settings menu. In previous generations, youâd find options nested inside options inside further options and so on, but with EMUI 5, the Settings menu is more user friendly and easier to navigate.. Take the battery menu for example; in EMUI 4.1, the battery menu could be found nested three levels deep but in EMUI 5, itâs a top-level menu. Dig into this menu and youâll find the usual plethora of options including an ultra-power saving mode (which reduces your usage to a couple of apps only), regular power saving and the ability to reduce the screen resolution to eek out the last hours of your battery.. Battery management has also been revamped in EMUI 5, with a large improvement in the way the interface handles power-intensive apps. Previously, Huawei phones would prompt you with constant notifications about resource-heavy apps, and these are a lot less persistent in EMUI 5. Huaweiâs new machine learning algorithm can be seen at work here as apps that you use frequently â in my case, this include Slack and FIFA Mobile â will appear in these prompts but wonât be killed off by default. EMUI now also gives you the option to blacklist rogue apps that might be the cause of battery drain and have them automatically killed when you turn off your display.. EMUI 5 also adds the ability to use multiple accounts with single-account applications like WhatsApp and Facebook, using the Twin App feature. How does EMUI does this? Essentially, the Mate 9 runs two instances of the app at the same time. If you have two SIM cards and have been frustrated as you couldn’t run Whatsapp with both numbers on the same phone, then the Twin App feature is the perfect solution.. What about the Porsche Design Mate 9? Does the curved display have any software benefits? In aÂ. The software experience is almost identical, save for some ugly Porsche Design themes, tweaks to UI tuning to take advantage of the high res display and a dark mode to save on battery life. The biggest difference is in day-to-day usage, where the on-screen keys from the regular Mate 9 are replaced by backÂ. keys flanking the home button; these keys aren’t labelled so you canÂ. swap them around and work just like you’d expect. Although it is possible to disable the keys and navigate by swiping the home key, it doesn’t really work as well as you’d hope, and we wish using on-screen keys like the regular Mate 9 was an option.. EMUI 5 is smooth, feature-rich and easily Huawei's best software to-date. The Mate 9 isnât a revolutionary upgrade over its predecessor, nor is it going to be for everyone, but it does excel in the key areas that Huawei intended it to: battery, performance and camera. 2016 is arguably the year where Huawei broke through, first with the P9 and now with the Mate 9. With all things considered, the Mate 9 is probably the best big-screen Android smartphone you can buy right now.. The very-public demise of the Galaxy Note 7, coupled with the current trend for smartphone displays to measure 5.5-inches or less, means the Mate 9 is one of just a handful of big Android devices currently available. The LG V20 is another of these but there doesnât seem to be an LG V20 launch planned for Europe, meaning the Mate 9 is the only big-screen flagship currently available for this market.. What will the Mate 9 cost? At the launch in Munich, Huawei confirmed the Mate 9 would cost â¬699 when it launches in Europe this month. Pricing for the US is yet to be confirmed but given the EU pricing, itâs likely to cost around $700 when it launches at CES in January. For those in the US that really want it right now though, you can find it online for around $750. This pricing puts the Mate 9 firmly in the flagship Android smartphone category, and while itâs not perfect, it can definitely hold its own against other devices.. What about the Porsche Design Mate 9? Well, if the glorious QHD display, subtle curves and stylish design have piqued your interest, it will set you back â¬1,395. Yep, the Porsche Design Mate 9 costs over a thousand Euros, which makes it a luxury smartphone, that isnât designed for the mass market.. If youâre after a smartphone that offers exceptional battery life, an intriguing dual camera and incredible performance, the Mate 9 delivers in spades. Should you buy either of them? If youâre after a smartphone that offers exceptional battery life, an intriguing dual camera and incredible performance, the Mate 9 delivers in spades. If money is no object and you want a smartphone that is unattainable to most customers, the Porsche Design Mate 9 is certainly worth considering.. Huawei , Huawei Mate 9.

Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9: Our first take. Porsche Design puts its name on a stunningly attractive, very high-spec smartphone that costs way more than it should. Design could be seen as derivative. Huawei calls the Porsche Design version of the Mate 9, “the best smartphone ever made,” and Huawei certainly made it clear the relationship between the two firms would never have gone ahead if that wasn’t the end goal. It’s a bold claim, but is it little more than bluster on Huawei’s part, or is the Porsche Design Mate 9 really something special? After all, it costs 1,400 euros, or at least $1,600, so it’s got to be more than a crass branding exercise, right?. Yes, Porsche Design’s name is emblazoned above the display and its PD logo is stamped centrally on the back, but it’s attached to a beautiful, eye-catching design, filled with some superb technical specifications.. The last time Porsche Design got involved with smartphones, it teamed up with BlackBerry. The resulting phones certainly stood out, but in the same way as a big, nasty wart does on the back of your hand. Although, we’d say this was more about who Porsche Design was trying to work with, than Porsche Design’s own abilities.. The Porsche Design Mate 9 doesn’t look like the regular Mate 9 , a phone that could actually do with a more eye-catching design, but instead, it really resembles the Galaxy S7 Edge. In reality, it feels more like the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus in the hand, thanks to sharper, more angled sides. It’s not uncomfortable to hold, but it doesn’t match the smoothness we love about the S7 Edge. The curved screen doesn’t take on any special purpose like the S7 Edge,. It’s matched to a curved rear panel, and the phone only comes in a brushed, almost matte black finish. The finish gives the phone a mature air, so it doesn’t look like a flashy trinket, and you’re going to feel pretty special every time you pull it out of your pocket. If the last time you saw a Porsche Design phone you recoiled in surprise at its unattractiveness, this time you’re going to be drawn in for a closer look by the subtle style.. The display measures 5.5-inches, smaller than the Mate 9’s huge 5.9-inch screen, but has a higher 2,560 x 1,440-pixel resolution. It looks great, filled with color and detail, and even in the short time we spent staring at it, we’d consider it a step beyond the Mate 9 and likely equal to Huawei’s other 1440p screen on the Nexus 6P .. It’s not uncomfortable to hold, but it doesn’t match the smoothness we love about the S7 Edge.. It’s running Android 7.0 Nougat with Huawei’s new EMUI 5.0 user interface over the top, which has a cleaner, simpler design to previous versions. Huawei is also talking up its long-term speed benefits too, saying it won’t slow down over time. It’s certainly speedy thanks to the new Kirin 960 processor and a whopping 6GB of RAM.. The Mate 9 Porsche model has the same 4,000mAh battery with SuperCharge technology, Huawei’s fast charger that rushes to 58 percent capacity in just 30 minutes. You won’t run out of storage quickly either, as there is 256GB built in.. What sets the Porsche Design Mate 9 apart from the visually similar Galaxy S7 Edge most is the dual-lens Leica camera on the back. Like the Mate 9, it’s the second-generation setup, which improves upon the dual-cameras on the. The Mate 9 boasts a 12-megapixel color lens and a 20-megapixel monochrome lens. It takes bokeh shots (that’s pictures with a blurred background) in both still and video mode, it’s easy to use due to Leica’s involvement with the software, and in the early tests we’ve performed, it’s a real winner.. If we stopped here, it’s hard to refute Huawei’s trumpeting of the Porsche Design Mate 9’s greatness. After all, it looks great, has plenty of power and storage, a super camera, and software smarts that should keep it performing well even after 18 months use.. One can’t help but think that without the Porsche Design branding, this is a phone that would cost the same as the Mate 9, which is half the price. The Galaxy S7 Edge is basically the same otherwise, and although the camera isn’t a Leica twin-lens job, it’s not like snapping pictures with a flip phone from 2005.. Owning the Porsche Design Mate 9 is more like owning the TAG Heuer Carrera Connected smartwatch. TAG Heuer’s watch is internally identical to many other Android watches, such as those from Fossil, yet costs four times as much. You’re paying for the pleasure of owning a TAG Heuer, with all the Swiss design heritage that comes with it. With the Mate 9, you’re paying more for Porsche Design’s sleek look and inherent coolness.. Most will take a look at the pictures, appreciate what it is, but won’t ever actually consider buying one. Even if you are tempted, finding one isn’t going to be easy. We understand it’s not coming to the U.S., and there’s no release date or confirmed regions of availability yet either. We imagine Porsche Design boutiques will be selling the phone, much like De Grisogono. boutiques carry the designer version of the Samsung Gear S2 , though.. Does the silly price tag mean the Porsche Design Mate 9 should be dismissed as a plaything? A phone only for those dripping in disposable cash? No. It’s technically very capable, remember, so purchasing one doesn’t mean compromising on performance. Plus, it makes us genuinely excited for the future. Will the next Huawei Watch have a Porsche Design version? Will we get a non-Porsche Design branded edition of the phone with a more reasonable price tag? How will the stunning looks and spec influence future fashion-forward phones from Huawei, such as the inevitable P10? We can’t wait to find out.. Ultimately, don’t let a desire for the Porsche Design version lessen your interest in the regular Mate 9. The bigger screen may have a lower resolution and no slinky curves, but all the other tech is present and correct, at a much lower price. If the money is there, waiting to be spent on something a bit frivolous that will make you smile, then the Porsche Design Mate 9 will be worth seeking out.. Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro are here — with some strange differences. Everything you need to know about the budget Honor 7X. Why 2017 was the best year for smartphones ever.

Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9 smartphone was launched in November 2016. The phone comes with a 5.50-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 1440 pixels by 2560 pixels.

more ... more .... more ... more .... Based on 1 User reviews. Extremely high pixel density screen (534 ppi). Lots of RAM (6 GB RAM). Lacks microSD slot for storage expansion. This is the rumored "curved screen" version of the Mate 9, meaning that it has a flexible AMOLED screen that is wrapped towards both sides of the glass and metal fusion body, like on the S7 edge. The back is also curved symmetrically with the front, and meets at a point that is just 3mm thick, which Huawei calls "visual thinness." The Porsche Design-ed Mate 9 sports a 5.5" diagonal, and comes in an OLED form with Quad HD resolution. Other than that, it shares the new Kirin 960 chipset that ships with blazing A73 cores, beating even the Snapdragon 821 when it comes to raw power, but upgrades the RAM to 6 GB, and the storage to 256 GB. It also has the same Leica-stamped camera duo on the rear (like the Mate 9), but the finger scanner has been moved to the front here.. Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design manual. OS: Android (8.0, 7.0), Huawei Emotion UI. Dimensions: 5.98 x 2.95 x 0.30 inches (152 x 75 x 7.5 mm). Weight: 5.96 oz (169 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 1440 x 2560 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Dual-camera (20-megapixel, F2.2 aperture), Optical image stabilization, Autofocus (Laser, Phase detection), CMOS image sensor, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Manual focus, Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets, Shutter speed control. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Macro mode, Effects. Features: Digital image stabilization, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Octa-core, 2400 MHz, ARM Cortex-A73 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: DLNA, Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular UMTS: 800, 850, 900, 1700/2100, 1900 MHz.

Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design Unboxing and Hands On Benchmarks. by Ian Cutress on November 18, 2016 8:15 AM EST. Huawei Mate 9 vs Mate 9 PD. Androbench* (run at default settings, not AT's usual settings). Alongside the Mate 9 launch a few weeks back, Huawei also announced the Mate 9 Porsche Design model. The presentation in Munich was heavily skewed towards the Porsche branded unit, despite the fact that it is a limited edition part to be sold at 1300 Euro, nearly twice as much as the Mate 9.. Aside from a few things such as the camera and the internal SoC, the Porsche Design (PD) model shares little aesthetically with the Mate 9. They both use the new Kirin 960 SoC, designed by Huawei's HiSilicon subsidiary and is the first design to use the newest ARM Cortex A73 CPU cores as well as CCI-550 interconnect and Mali G71 graphics cores (read about the Kirin 960 here). But where the Mate 9 has 4 GB of DDR4, the PD has 6GB. Where the Mate 9 has 32/64 GB of US 2.1 storage, the PD has 256GB. Perhaps the biggest change is in the display - where the Mate 9 uses a 5.96-inch 1920x1080 screen, the PD opts for a dual edged curved 5.5-inch 2560x1440 panel.. To be honest, the curve is almost unnoticeable. It could easily be mistaken for curved glass on a flat display, but I can confirm that the display itself is curved. The reason for the curve is more to do with economics than new user interface experiences, and Huawei has actively promoted that it's new EMUI 5.0 operating system interface, based on Android 7.0, has new mis-touch algorithms to identify when part of the screen is accidentally touched, for example when taking a photograph.. The higher resolution display might arguably draw more power, especially during high graphics activity, but the physically smaller PD version has a similar 4000 mAh battery configuration to the Mate 9. With the hardware comes Huawei Supercharge, a new technology to enable up to 25W charging with compatible adaptors and cables - it relies on sensor data and communication between the charger and phone to remain cool but also offers 0 to 58% charge in 30 minutes. As the CEO said at the launch, 'No explosions.'. Mate 9 PD and Mate 9 - Note no fingerprint sensor on the PD, it's been moved to the front. The PD uses Huawei's second generation dual camera system on the rear, co-engineered with Leica. The configuration gives a 20MP color and 12MP black and white set of cameras to enable variable depth bokeh applied in post processing, a true monochrome mode, and what the promotional materials want to define as 'the Leica look' to ensure that certain pictures have that Leica feel.. When we spoke with Leica at the Huawei event, we were told that Leica's involvement between the two companies starts the moment the photon hits the lenses, to when the image data is stored in memory. This means Leica is involved in the lens configuration, the sensor choice,. different sensor features, DSP implementation/use and algorithm feature set. Huawei and Leica are set to open a new joint R&D facility in France next year to cohesion future products.. Top to bottom: Mate 9 PD, Mate 9, Mate 8. The PD puts the 3.5mm jack on the bottom, contrary to previous Huawei designs.. The Mate 9 removes the alternate texture on the power button for easy differentiation,. but the PD and Mate 8 have it.. As always with a new device, it felt snappy even if there was a detectable dropped frame here and there. Huawei is promoting that EMUI 5.0 has a series of features in place through machine learning to subvert that feel of a slow device after 6-12 months, as well as some new GUI 'tricks' to help the user experience. The PD model will use a different tableau of browner icons for the core system apps, as well as different backgrounds on the system. Despite the fact that Porsche Design and Porsche are different companies, I would have thought that the PD model might have some Porsche or Leica related backgrounds to choose from.. For the 1300 Euro (the PD won't be sold in the US), the PD model is designed as a lifestyle product, for people who buy the car, buy the shoes, then buy the phone. In the box is a custom case designed for the curve screen, a set of custom ear buds, a Supercharger wall wart, a Supercharger car wart, and a standard C-to-C cable.. Gallery: Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design Unboxing and Hands On Benchmarks. On the benchmarking side, it is worth noting that these results were on near-final software. Huawei is pushing an update out to review units soon to support Android 7.1 and Daydream VR as well as minor OS fixes. But as we only had limited time with the PD, results were taken as is.. So despite the fact that the Mate 9 and PD have the same SoC, the performance of the PD in most situations was lower than that of the Mate 9. I might attribute this to the smaller chassis having lower thermal limits, but even recording 17-minute 4K video on the Mate 9 made it barely warm to touch, so it makes me wonder how the PD is slower in short benchmarks as well.. One part that the PD wins out on is storage if we run the benchmark at default (typically AT has a custom workflow which we did not have time to run - the default results can perhaps bloat the numbers more than a user might experience). The 256GB solution in this configuration beats the 64GB Mate 9 for sequential and random performance.. Overall, from a brief hands-on, it's clear that the key selling point of the Mate 9 Porsche Design is going to be the exclusivity. It's not aimed at someone like me, who would suggest the Mate 9 (or the recently announced Mate 9 Pro) if budget or performance is a concern.. Please log in or sign up to comment.. Michael Bay - Friday, November 18, 2016 - link. Is that a hair or a scratch?. boyang1724 - Friday, November 18, 2016 - link. ddriver - Friday, November 18, 2016 - link. It is a scratch hair - a hair, dislodged by scratching. I have to give it to them, the PD variant looks much worse, much cheaper. The same goes for the custom case. The phone also looks very dirty, can't tell if this is due to the "unique material properties" or someone's filthy hands. The phone doesn't look slick and high end, it looks like a cheap knockoff. Also, next time, try using an actual camera. Ethos Evoss - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link. anactoraaron - Friday, November 18, 2016 - link. I don't know why, but when I think of Porsche I think red. I'm kind of disappointed it isn't red. WithoutWeakness - Friday, November 18, 2016 - link. Ferrari is definitely red in my mind.

Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9: Our first take. Porsche Design puts its name on a stunningly attractive, very high-spec smartphone that costs way more than it should. Huawei calls the Porsche Design version of the Mate 9, “the best smartphone ever made,” and Huawei certainly made it clear the relationship between the two firms would never have gone ahead if that wasn’t the end goal. It’s a bold claim, but is it little more than bluster on Huawei’s part, or is the Porsche Design Mate 9 really something special? After all, it costs 1,400 euros, or at least $1,600, so it’s got to be more than a crass branding exercise, right?. Yes, Porsche Design’s name is emblazoned above the display and its PD logo is stamped centrally on the back, but it’s attached to a beautiful, eye-catching design, filled with some superb technical specifications.. Related: Our first impression of the Huawei Mate 9. The last time Porsche Design got involved with smartphones, it teamed up with BlackBerry. The resulting phones certainly stood out, but in the same way as a big, nasty wart does on the back of your hand. Although, we’d say this was more about who Porsche Design was trying to work with, than Porsche Design’s own abilities.. The Porsche Design Mate 9 doesn’t look like the regular Mate 9 , a phone that could actually do with a more eye-catching design, but instead, it really resembles the Galaxy S7 Edge. In reality, it feels more like the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus in the hand, thanks to sharper, more angled sides. It’s not uncomfortable to hold, but it doesn’t match the smoothness we love about the S7 Edge. The curved screen doesn’t take on any special purpose like the S7 Edge,. porsche design huawei mate first impressions. porsche design huawei mate first impressions. porsche design huawei mate first impressions. Leica camera Expensive Conclusion Highs Beautiful design Stunning high-res screen Leica dual-lens camera Lots of storage space Fast processor Latest Android version Lows Really expensive Limited release Design could be seen as derivative Samsung Galaxy X: Rumors and news leaks The wait is over, the dual-lens, big-screen Leica-tuned Huawei P9 Plus is yours to buy. porsche design huawei mate first impressions. It’s matched to a curved rear panel, and the phone only comes in a brushed, almost matte black finish. The finish gives the phone a mature air, so it doesn’t look like a flashy trinket, and you’re going to feel pretty special every time you pull it out of your pocket. If the last time you saw a Porsche Design phone you recoiled in surprise at its unattractiveness, this time you’re going to be drawn in for a closer look by the subtle style.. Huawei’s Mate 9 is what high-end smartphone dreams are made of. The display measures 5.5-inches, smaller than the Mate 9’s huge 5.9-inch screen, but has a higher 2,560 x 1,440-pixel resolution. It looks great, filled with color and detail, and even in the short time we spent staring at it, we’d consider it a step beyond the Mate 9 and likely equal to Huawei’s other 1440p screen on the Nexus 6P .. It’s running Android 7.0 Nougat with Huawei’s new EMUI 5.0 user interface over the top, which has a cleaner, simpler design to previous versions. Huawei is also talking up its long-term speed benefits too, saying it won’t slow down over time. It’s certainly speedy thanks to the new Kirin 960 processor and a whopping 6GB of RAM.. The Mate 9 Porsche model has the same 4,000mAh battery with SuperCharge technology, Huawei’s fast charger that rushes to 58 percent capacity in just 30 minutes. You won’t run out of storage quickly either, as there is 256GB built in.. What sets the Porsche Design Mate 9 apart from the visually similar Galaxy S7 Edge most is the dual-lens Leica camera on the back. Like the Mate 9, it’s the second-generation setup, which improves upon the dual-cameras on the. The Mate 9 boasts a 12-megapixel color lens and a 20-megapixel monochrome lens. It takes bokeh shots (that’s pictures with a blurred background) in both still and video mode, it’s easy to use due to Leica’s involvement with the software, and in the early tests we’ve performed, it’s a real winner.. If we stopped here, it’s hard to refute Huawei’s trumpeting of the Porsche Design Mate 9’s greatness. After all, it looks great, has plenty of power and storage, a super camera, and software smarts that should keep it performing well even after 18 months use.. One can’t help but think that without the Porsche Design branding, this is a phone that would cost the same as the Mate 9, which is half the price. The Galaxy S7 Edge is basically the same otherwise, and although the camera isn’t a Leica twin-lens job, it’s not like snapping pictures with a flip phone from 2005.. How to use the Huawei P9’s superb dual-lens camera. Owning the Porsche Design Mate 9 is more like owning the TAG Heuer Carrera Connected smartwatch. TAG Heuer’s watch is internally identical to many other Android watches, such as those from Fossil, yet costs four times as much. You’re paying for the pleasure of owning a TAG Heuer, with all the Swiss design heritage that comes with it. With the Mate 9, you’re paying more for Porsche Design’s sleek look and inherent coolness.. Most will take a look at the pictures, appreciate what it is, but won’t ever actually consider buying one. Even if you are tempted, finding one isn’t going to be easy. We understand it’s not coming to the U.S., and there’s no release date or confirmed regions of availability yet either. We imagine Porsche Design boutiques will be selling the phone, much like De Grisogono. boutiques carry the designer version of the Samsung Gear S2 , though.. Does the silly price tag mean the Porsche Design Mate 9 should be dismissed as a plaything? A phone only for those dripping in disposable cash? No. It’s technically very capable, remember, so purchasing one doesn’t mean compromising on performance. Plus, it makes us genuinely excited for the future. Will the next Huawei Watch have a Porsche Design version? Will we get a non-Porsche Design branded edition of the phone with a more reasonable price tag? How will the stunning looks and spec influence future fashion-forward phones from Huawei, such as the inevitable P10? We can’t wait to find out.. Ultimately, don’t let a desire for the Porsche Design version lessen your interest in the regular Mate 9. The bigger screen may have a lower resolution and no slinky curves, but all the other tech is present and correct, at a much lower price. If the money is there, waiting to be spent on something a bit frivolous that will make you smile, then the Porsche Design Mate 9 will be worth seeking out..

For our current range of Huawei devices, please click HERE. Huawei is developing some incredible smartphones, truly challenging the premium end of the market with powerful and beautiful products.. The standard Mate 9 is such a phone, including high-class camera sensors, processing power and fingerprint recognition, all packaged into their updated EMUI interface.. This Porsche Design model takes the Mate 9 and makes some subtle changes. The casing has been reworked into a limited edition finish that includes Porsche branding. A physical home button has also been added to the base of the phone.. Huawei has also streamlined the design; the phone is physically smaller and lighter, featuring a 5.5" QHD screen, rather than the standard Mate 9's 5.9" FHD screen.. This Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design is available from Clove Technology SIM Free and factory unlocked. It can be used with any compatible network SIM card.. For full network compatibility, please check the specifications.. The Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design is available in one brushed black finish with a total of 256GB internal storage and 6GB of RAM.. Huawei is pushing the boundaries of Android smartphones. Be it design, construction, photography or user interface, the Mate 9 Porsche Design is an example of a modern smartphone that makes no compromises.. Every specification is reaching for excellence in an attempt to be the most desirable device you'll lay your eyes on.. The first thing you'll notice is the incredible screen. The Mate 9 Porsche Design showcases a truly stunning 5.5" display with Quad HD (2K) resolution. This is encased in a super-svelte chassis that's only 7.5mm thin.. Slim bezels and 2.5D curved glass that seamlessly transitions to the metal edging, make for a phone that hides its size by being a dream to hold. Polished aluminium edges contrast with the glossy rears for a contemporary finish.. The circular fingerprint sensor can be found centre-mounted on the reverse of the phone, just below the cameras. This can be set up just for unlocking the screen, or for accessing secure areas of the phone and authorising online payments.. The speaker and microphone systems have also seen an improvement since earlier Huawei Mate phones. There are now 4 noise-cancelling mics for ultra-clear call quality and audio capture during video recording.. Why have one camera when you can have two? Dual-camera systems are fast becoming the way to challenge the perceptions of mobile photography.. Both of the Mate 9 Porsche Design's dual cameras use Leica lens technology. The main camera is a traditional 12MP colour sensor, complemented by a 20MP monochrome (black and white) module.. By combining the images taken by these two sensors, stunning results are created. The standard RGB sensor captures a deep colour range, whilst the monochrome sensor is able to discern fine details and contrasts.. You also have the option to produce stunning native black and white photography, without resorting to a post-production filter.. Another neat effect of using two sensors simultaneously is simulating depth of field. Huawei's advanced camera application allows you to modify the virtual focal length and achieve incredible Bokeh and Zoom effects previously unattainable on smartphone cameras.. It's not all about the back though - the Mate 9 also provides a powerful 8MP selfie camera with autofocus and automatic shutter modes.. With their size and prominence, Huawei has been able to develop their own range of powerful processors. The HiSilicon Kirin 960 processor is one of the most advanced mobile chips available today.. An octa-core unit, the Kirin 960 has a high-speed 2.4 GHz four-core and complementary 1.8 GHz four-core CPU. Supporting DDR4 RAM and utilising the incredible new Mali-G71 GPU for graphics, the Mate 9 Porsche Design can handle anything the modern world of mobile computing and gaming can throw at it.. Huawei has also implemented a new Machine Learning algorithm. This runs continuously in the background, monitoring your usage habits. This takes information on the apps you regularly use and is constantly optimising CPU, RAM and ROM resources in the background.. This is known as Smart Resource Allocation. Memory intensive background apps are automatically closed. RAM resources are automatically recycled, so there is more memory for priority apps. Even the ROM is improved: an exclusive channel of Storage I/O makes the apps you use the most work faster by retrieving and saving data more quickly.. The result is a phone that responds as fast as possible, with improved battery life.. Huawei's EMUI is an example of how to modify the Android system into something almost completely different. All of the core Android elements are available, styled into a fresh and unique experience.. Messages, Alerts, Photos and Notifications are all easier to interact with thanks to the EMUI modifications.. Speed Octa Core (4 x 2.4 GHz & 4 x 1.8 GHz).

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Screen mirroring DLNA, Wireless screen share Wireless screen share.

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $560 Buy.

Battery life Big 4,000mAh battery Impressive stamina Super charging really is very quick Camera Dual-lens Leica-branded camera 20MP monochrome sensor, 12MP color one Wide aperture mode lets you change focus in post-production Camera samples. Another shared component the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design has with the plain Huawei Mate 9 is its battery, which comes in at a very healthy 4,000mAh.. This is good news, because we were very impressed with the Mate 9’s stamina, and we’re similarly impressed here. Even with intensive usage, you’ll be able to get through a full day with the phone without needing a top-up.. Here’s a real use case scenario to give an idea of how the phone performs in real life. One morning we took the phone off charge at 9:30, and embarked on a day of moderate usage.. That included a constant - but by no means heavy - stream of email and message notifications, a couple of calls, some web browsing and direction finding on Google Maps, and around 15 minutes of 3D gaming. When we checked the battery at around 23:50, it was at 53%.. Interestingly, in our regular battery test, the Mate 9 Porsche Design out-performed its plain brother. The test involves a 90 minute looped 720p video, with the brightness turned right up and all notifications on.. This test consistently consumed 12% of the Porsche Design’s battery, which comfortably beats the Mate 9 on 17%. We’re not sure what the reason for this was - perhaps it was an update to the Video app or Emotion UI, or perhaps the smaller (though sharper) AMOLED display was simply more efficient at displaying this video, but it’s impressive any way you stack it.. It’s also worth pointing out that the Mate 9 Porsche Design pips the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , which lost 14% in the same test, and sports a similar 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED display.. Another impressive feat is the speed at which the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design recharges. It uses Huawei’s SuperCharge technology in conjunction with the USB-C standard to great effect.. Plugging it in with 43% charge on the clock - something you can reasonably expect to do after a long day of normal usage - it had climbed to 60% after ten minutes. In half an hour it was up to 80%, and after an hour of charging it reached 97%.. Huawei claims that you can reach a day’s worth of usage in just 20 minutes, and we can believe that to be true if you were charging from a lower starting point - this kind of quick-charging technology invariably slows as you reach full capacity.. Huawei clearly knew it was onto a pretty good thing with the dual-lens camera of the Huawei P9 and Huawei Mate 9, as it’s also used a dual-lens snapper for the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design.. It’s an innovative Leica-branded camera with one 12MP RGB sensor and one 20MP monochrome sensor. The primary intended function of this is to combine the images from both to produce sharper pictures than you could manage with a single sensor.. The idea is that the monochrome sensor is better able to capture fine detail. In practice we were impressed with the amount of detail packed into the pictures we took, but we wouldn’t say they were better than the likes of the single-sensor iPhone 7 or Samsung Galaxy S7 .. Still, there are other benefits to this unusual dual-lens approach. The most notable is the ability to refocus shots after you’ve taken them - though you have to remember to select the ‘Wide aperture’ mode specifically in the camera UI.. In certain situations - chiefly in landscape shots with pronounced depth and layers - this can be quite a neat tool to have, as it almost guarantees you’ll be able to get the shot you want. It’s easy to control, too - just tap on the area of the picture you want to focus on, then save the results (the original will also be kept in the Gallery app). But its usefulness is otherwise quite limited.. The dual-lens setup also combines with optical image stabilization to make for some decent night time shots, though there was still plenty of noise in artificially lit indoor environments - which, let’s face it, is when most of us take our shots.. There’s also a Pro mode, which lets you micro-manage the usual range of settings such as ISO, shutter speed, and white balance.. Overall, the camera app itself is one of the better custom examples we’ve used, aping much of the style of the iOS equivalent but with a number of extra tricks.. The 8MP front camera doesn’t have any great tricks to boast of, but is perfectly fine at what it does - provided you give it plenty of light.. The camera here handles a mix of light sources and captures the detail of the scene quite well.. Click here to see the full resolution image.

You had a double take, didn't you? No, this isn't a limited edition Samsung Galaxy S7 edge , it's the limited edition Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design.. The Chinese telecoms company and German design company have forged a new partnership to show off what they can do. The result is a savvy, sophisticated looking smartphone. Which happens to cost an eye-watering €1395.. Here's what we have to make of the Porsche Design from our time with the device at the Huawei Mate 9 launch in Munich. It won't be coming to the UK, so this is as good a glimpse as it'll get for many.. What's perhaps most unusual about this Porsche Design phone is that it's nothing like the Mate 9 from which it takes its name. For starters the Porsche Design version has a 5.5-inch, 2160 x 1440 pixel resolution screen - not the larger 5.9-inch, 1920 x 1080 resolution screen of the Mate 9 .. From a size point of view, these devices only share their name. The Porsche Design measures 7.5mm thick, meaning it's slightly thinner than the 7.9mm Mate 9 - but it still manages to cram in a massive 4,000mAh battery capacity, which is great news.. The Porsche Design version of the Mate 9 is also subtly curved to its edges, including the glass screen and metal front and rear. It's a symmetrical curve front to back - which is where our Samsung S7 edge comparison comes into play. The two phones do look frightfully similar.. The Porsche Design is as well made as we've seen from a phone. Its metal has a brushed finish, which glints in the light. It's also an ultimate fingerprint magnet, which detracts from the look, despite its screen appearing less glossy than the S7 edge we mention .. Speaking of fingerprints, to access the scanner you won't wangle your finger around the back (where the circular scanner is present on the Mate 9), as the Porsche Design model has its scanner on the front home key. That leaves just enough room for a shiny Porsche Design logo on the rear, which is like a lower-case P and D combined into one emblem - and far nicer than the massive "Porsche Design" all-caps statement on the front of the phone.. This looks a lot like Samsung again. The surrounding capacative touch buttons, however, are much more like the OnePlus 3 in terms of their response - from their placement outside of the screen, through to their single dot emblems on both sides.. The Mate 9 Porsche Design also benefits from a bump in spec elsewhere. While it embodies the same Kirin 960 octa-core chipset as the larger Mate 9, it pairs that with 6GB RAM rather than just 4GB.. It also benefits from the latest Mali G71 MP8 GPU, which moves on from OpenGL to the Vulkan platform - which is even more responsive than you'll find in many other phones. It's a phone perfectly suited to devouring high-end mobile games.. Porsche Design has also chosen to go rather iPhone 7 in its unibody design thinking , which means no microSD card slot is available. Instead the only model comes loaded with a whopping 256GB storage for you to load it up with content. That might go some way to explain its huge price tag.. As if one German company wasn't enough, Huawei has snagged two. Yep, Leica returns in the Mate 9, including the Porsche Design version, with its dual camera arrangement.. It's much like that found in the earlier Huawei P9 model - meaning one 12-megapixel colour sensor and one black & white one - but now the B&W sensor is higher-resolution, at 20-megapixel. The added resolution is there to help with a "hybrid zoom", which uses the mono information from the higher-resolution B&W image to enhance the detail in the colour image when digitally zooming.. Both cameras feature 27mm f/2.2 equivalent lenses and now have optical image stabilisation, hence the small bump to the rear - although it protrodes slightly less in the Porsche Design model than it does in the standard Mate 9.. And let's not forget 4K video capture (H.265 compression) too. Otherwise the bulk of the Porsche Design model is just like that of the Mate 9. We're particularly impressed that there's a 4,000mAh battery on board here - including SuperCharge technology for fast-charging - just as there is in the larger Mate 9.. This also means Huawei's latest EMUI software reskin - now in version 5.0, sat over the top of Android 7.0 Nougat - comes present and correct. That means a simpler interface, with a cleaner design, plus some interesting options like dual Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp use via the Dual SIM. Other details resemble the standard Mate 9. So why not take a read of our full preview, below, to get the low-down on what to expect.. What can we say? Despite the bonkers price, the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design is a lovely looking phone. Well made and all powerful, it overshadows the standard Mate 9 to such an extent that now all we want is this limited edition version.. Saying that, the Mate 9 name is kind of misleading. The Porsche Design's different screen size, body size, curved design front to back, plus repositioning of the fingerprint scanner make it a wholly different and wholly exciting phone..
