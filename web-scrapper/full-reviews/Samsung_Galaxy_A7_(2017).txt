Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017 - gold sand). CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The A7 looks just like the Galaxy S7 and has a 22-hour battery life. NFC means you can use Android Pay.. The Bad The phone is a fingerprint magnet and accidental palm presses make it hard to use one-handed. It also runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which is... The Bottom Line If you're looking for a cheaper, pared-down version of the Samsung Galaxy S7, this is it.. It looks like the Samsung Galaxy S7 ( $240.99 at Amazon.com ) , feels like the Samsung Galaxy S7, but isn't actually the S7. No it's the 2017 version of Samsung's midrange series, and it's a pretty good-looking phone at that. While it's no OnePlus 3T , the current king of the midrange, the A7 has the chops to stand out as one of the best.. Samsung Galaxy A7 shows off its metal style. While the OnePlus 3T boasts a flagship processor, the A7 takes a more typical midrange route with a 1.9GHz Exynos 7880 that's comparable to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 615 chip. That's not a mark against it though, as the phone runs as smooth as butter, especially on games like Asphalt 8. The only thing I felt could be better was palm rejection -- the phone would constantly register my palm brushes when I used the phone one-handed.. And while it's still only running Android 6.0 Marshmallow with no word on an update, you gotta give props to Samsung for the phone's amazing 22-hour battery life (which we got looping a video in airplane mode). I'm still pretty much blown away by how much of a workhorse this phone can be -- easily lasting a full day of hard use.. Retailing at S$648 in Singapore, which is around $450, £365 or AU$615, for the 32GB version, the A7 seems like a really good deal. There's, however, no word yet on whether Samsung will sell the A7 in the US, but we'll update this review if they do. It should, however, hit Europe soon.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition.... LG just gave Samsung a run for the money.. But we're still waiting on the Siri-like AI.. The Pixel 2's superb camera makes it worth a look.. This week on CNET News.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Daniel Petrov. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction Samsung released a pretty strong entrance in the mid-range Android segment with the waterproof 2017 A-series trio, and now we have the largest of them all – Galaxy A7 – to check out on. It shares specs with the A5 , which we already reviewed – 14nm Exynos chipset and two 16 MP cameras – but has a half an inch longer display diagonal and a 20% larger battery. Will these warrant the price difference between the two for big screen aficionados? Let's find out... What's in the box: Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) model SM-A720F/DS (dual SIM) User Manual and warranty leaflets Sim ejector tool USB-A to USB-C cable White Samsung OEM EHS64 earbuds with replaceable rubber tips 2A wall charger (15 watts peak, 9V and 1.67A, or 5V and 2A) Design Samsung is moving its flagship glass-and-metal chassis downmarket, so don't drop the A7 biggie. Our Galaxy A7 (2017) looks like a nondescript black slab before you pick it up, but when you do, the premium crafting is palatable. The phone is also available in several other colors, including a very nice pastel blue. Samsung moved the glass-and-metal design of its flagships downstream this year, and as a result the A7 has a dark metal frame sandwiched between two plates of glass. It's not Gorilla Glass 5, though, and as the case is with all types of glass, it will crack if subjected to enough impact force. The A7 is a pretty big phone, too, with a 5.7" display, so make sure you don't drop it while getting it out first, before you have gotten used to the grip needed to secure its dimensions in your palm. The biggest downside of the handset stems precisely from its largish display, as it is not very conducive to handling in the palm only, especially if it has a case tacked on, too. The sides of the phone are busier than usual, as Samsung has moved the speaker from its traditional place on the back or bottom where it is likely to get covered during certain activities, to the right side, above the home key. It's a good placement, and the speaker grill isn't covered easily when you watch videos in landscape mode as we were afraid it would. The power key on the right, and the volume buttons on the left are somewhat thin, but made out of sturdy metal, they don't wobble, and are easy to find and press without looking if need be. Last but by no means least, Samsung has provided two SIM card trays in the A7 Duo version. Given that this phone will be sold in regions where dual SIM card phones are very popular, it is going to prove a wise decision. Moreover, the A7 can function with two SIMs and a microSD card inserted at the same time, unlike many dual SIM phones that make you choose between dual SIM functionality or expandable storage. All SIM card slots are plug and play, too, there is no need to power down the phone first in order to add or swap SIMs.Dreamy! We'd advise against doing that with the secondary combined tray at the top, though, as it also houses the microSD card, and, if you are writing something on it at the moment, taking it our without powering off the phone may result in loss of information on it. Display Same old, same old AMOLED advantages and mishaps Move on, people, nothing to see here, just your run-of-the-mill 5.7” Super AMOLED display with 1080x1920 pixels. We can't scoff at the resolution as it is perfectly enough and allows for longer battery life, but we can whine about the viewing angles. The color shifts to overly cold and blueish with the slightest tilt of the phone, which, if you are coming from an LCD panel, can be pretty annoying. Other than than that, if you run the Galaxy A7's display in Basic mode, it will exhibit credible colors with tamed saturation levels. In the default Adaptive mode, however, the phone is becoming your typical loud AMOLED with flashy, overzealous colors. The screen is bright enough, and with low reflectance ratio, so it is comfortable to view outside. The A7 also has ‘Always-on Display’ mode that shows you the time, date and the type of missed notifications even when your screen is locked (but not the actual notifications). The letters are well contrasted and easy to see, but be warned – this will have a noticeable impact on battery life.. 6.17 x 3.06 x 0.31 inches. 156.8 x 77.6 x 7.9 mm. 5.75 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches. 146.1 x 71.4 x 7.9 mm. 6.01 x 2.94 x 0.29 inches. 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35 mm. 5.94 x 2.86 x 0.3 inches. 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) Compare.

(Posts: 25; Member since: 23 Feb 2017). posted on 10 Mar 2017, 20:42. I think because of A7 2017 has almost the same spec as A5 2017, only screen size and battery. And A5 2017 has already been review. (Posts: 124; Member since: 09 Mar 2017). posted on 10 Mar 2017, 10:22. (Posts: 743; Member since: 02 Mar 2017). posted on 10 Mar 2017, 10:28. Very nice phone, but I just hate 2.5D glass screens which kill the possibility of an edge-to-edge screen protector for the sake of a gimmicky design, not even a true curved screen. I hate Apple for starting this stupid trend. At least LG did something about it with the G6, hopefully other models will follow.. posted on 10 Mar 2017, 12:47. Well I'm not disagreeing with you, you made me realize I have not actually used a screen protector in nearly 3 years.. (Posts: 2; Member since: 15 Mar 2016). posted on 23 Mar 2017, 12:17.

"Hope this battery life comes on the S8 considering it's gonna have a small battery.". Also consider that the S8 will have a higher resolution display too, along with a more power-hungry SoC that the one in this A7(2017).. (Posts: 590; Member since: 26 Mar 2015). posted on 10 Mar 2017, 11:38.

Where are the benchmark scores? Where are the battery life test results?. Is this some kind of ongoing joke?. (Posts: 291; Member since: 02 Jan 2013). posted on 12 Mar 2017, 04:52. With this price you can get high end phone type like one plus3 or xiaomi mi5. Crappy camera doesnt have OIS not 4k and not so good chipset with this price yet it get an 8, while LG G6 gets only 8.7 lol.. (Posts: 1; Member since: 06 Jun 2017). posted on 06 Jun 2017, 08:05. I am really not happy with this phone from day 1. I have to restart this phone more than my old black berry. My old Note 2 is really the best I ever had. Loosing connection to my internet and freezing most of the time. Going back to my old phone would not recommend this make to anybody maybe I got a dud phone..

Don't ever buy Samsung, they have the worst Customer service, when you have a warranty issues, you have to wait and wait send email after email wait 24 to 72 HR for them to contact you. They never do and then you have to start all over. Get a different phone and Tablet because when they stop working after 3 months you have to wait 3 month more just to get it fixed thats if you get lucky.. Want to comment? Please login or register ..

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed.

Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards.

(Last letter varies by carrier & international models). 2, 2017 ; 13 months ago. 156.8 × 77.6 × 7.9 mm. Original: Android 6.0.1 "Marshmallow" (with Grace UX). Current: Android 7.0 "Nougat" with Samsung Experience 8.1. Samsung Exynos 7 Octa 7880. 5.7" Super AMOLED FHD display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4, 1080×1920 px. The Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) is an Android high to midrange smartphone produced by Samsung Electronics. It was announced on January 2, 2017, along with Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) and Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017). This move marks Samsung's first product launch since the discontinuation of the Galaxy Note 7 back on October 2016. The Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow right out-of-the-box and runs on Grace UX interface (and upgradable to Android 7.0 "Nougat" with Samsung Experience 8.1). The smartphone features an Exynos 7880 SoC consisting of 8 ARM Cortex-A53 backed by the Mali-T830MP3 GPU and sports 3. GB internal storage, expandable to 256. GB via a MicroSD slot which it has a dedicated slot unlike the predecessors of the A7 (which it was placed in the second Nano-SIM slot), but MicroSD and Nano-SIM is not supported on the same tray [2]. The device retains a non-removable battery like its predecessor, rated at 3600mAh with fast-charging capabilities. Its extra features, similar to Samsung's 2016 flagship's, include IP68 water resistance, Always-on Display, and 3D glass backing with Gorilla Glass 4. A new "Always On display" functionality displays a clock, calendar, and notifications on-screen when the device is in standby. [3] The Samsung A7 2017 is expected to receive the latest Android 8 Oreo OS.. Following the unveiling, Samsung announced that they will sell up to 20 million smartphones, targeting Eastern Europe , Africa , Asia , and Latin America. Unlike its predecessors, the Galaxy A7 (2017) will not be coming to the United States and Western Europe. While Samsung Galaxy A7 (2015) had broader availability in Western Europe, this model was never sold in that region because it was being deemed too expensive and also due to near-direct competition against Samsung Galaxy S7. Samsung will instead sell the Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) and Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) to these countries instead.. "Samsung unveils first smartphones since Note 7 debacle".

Samsung recently brought the mid-range Galaxy A7 (2017) to its home country. The South Korean variant of the device ships with a stripped-down version of the company's in-house AI assistant, Bixby on board.. The 2017 iteration of the Samsung Galaxy A7 was initially launched to the international markets back in January. After a couple of months in several markets across the globe, the device finally became available in its home country, South Korea. Apparently, the South Korean variant will pack an additional feature; it ships with the in-house intelligent assistant Bixby on board. It makes the Galaxy A7 (2017) the first smartphone from the Galaxy A series to come with the company's digital assistant. To recall, the AI assistant Bixby debuted on the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ flagship devices last March. It is worth noting, though, that the mid-range Galaxy A7 (2017) will not sport the full version of Bixby, as there is no built-in hardware button for Bixby and no voice control functionality like the one found in the Galaxy S8 series.. Aside from the newly-added feature, the South Korean Galaxy A7 (2017) is all the same with the international model regarding the specs. As a refresher, the handset sports a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. Under the hood, it comes with an Exynos 7880 octa-core processor clocked at 1.9GHz and paired with Mali-T830 MP3 GPU. It packs 3GB of RAM and 32GB internal flash storage which supports an expandable memory of up to 256GB via microSD card. On the camera department, the phone features a 16-megapixel rear snapper with f/1.9 aperture, autofocus, and LED flash, and a 16-megapixel selfie camera with the same aperture. Everything is taken care of a 3600mAh non-removable battery.. The Bixby-infused Galaxy A7 (2017) is only available via the local carrier, SK Telecom, for KRW 588,500, which is around USD 515. The smartphone has three color options to choose from, namely Black Sky, Gold Sand, and Peach Cloud.. Read more news on this product. Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017): A5 with a Larger Screen and Added Features. There are different ranges when it comes to smartphone devices. Other than the top-ranking models, "value for its features" is a crucial feature which plays a huge factor in making it a worthwhile product in the market. And the mid-range smartphone market is a highly competitive market. Samsung adds yet another phone to this sector and has named it the new A7.. Samsung has led the smartphone market for quite some time now with multiple benchmark breaking top-range products. And by trickling down features from these top rangers, they have created multiple mid-segment and low-segment smartphones with enough bonuses to attract buyers away from rival products.. And that's just what this recently launched Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) is all about. This is not a typically mid-range product as it's priced comprehensively on the higher end. But it has more features for the buyer to get used to quickly.. Nothing less than a sleek model with above-conventional looks is expected from Samsung. And this Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) lives up to expectations and above. Dimensions for this model come in as 156.8 x 77.6 x 7.9 mm (6.17 x 3.06 x 0.31 inches) which makes it fairly large but compact enough for a single hand usage as every smartphone ought to be.. The body material is entirely metal with aluminum accents and a 3D glass black rear panel. It is IP86 certified and comes with water plus dust resistance.. Its 7.9-inch thickness and feather-weight of 186 grams is where Samsung has played its magic, something that will be a huge selling point especially with the features it has inside. This compactness of design and splendid looks comes down a lot to its display screen.. A 2.5D glass display with a 4th gen Corning Gorilla Glass protection shares a 73.6% proportion with the body. This 5.7 inches Super AMOLED screen provides Full-HD (1920 x 1280 pixels) at 386 pixels per inch density. Colors are more than a vivid and details are nearly life-like.. A powerful Exynos 7880 Octa chipset runs an OctaCore 1.9 GHz Cortex A53 processor in this phone allowing for smooth multi-functioning and utility. A Mali T830MP2 GPU or Graphics Processing Unit takes multimedia entertainment and gaming functions to an even higher level.. All of this is coupled with a 3 GB RAM. Internal storage comes in at 32 GB with an extendable option of up to 256 GB via microSD cards.. Both the cameras available with this Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) are of 16 MP with a f/1.9 aperture. And Samsung has officially stated that it is tailor-manufactured for low light photos. Its 16 MP front camera is an improvement over previous gen models and it can take beautiful selfies irrespective of light and setting.. This Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) runs on an Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with the latest updates. And there's a high chance that the manufacturers might throw in a 7.0 Nougat update later on.. Dual-SIM, 4G compatibility, Wi-Fi Hotspot, Bluetooth v 4.2 - this model is, of course, up-to-date with connectivity features. A 3600 mAh battery powers this Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) and it comes with Samsung's fast charging.. Other features include Geomagnetic, RGB light, Barometer, Gyro among other sensors..

Price of the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 in Qatar, Qatar 5.5-inch Super AMOLED Display 16-Megapixel Rear Camera Exynos 7870 Octa-core Processor Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Release Date Qatar Decent octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM Great display with Gorilla Glass 4 protection Both the front and rear camera is a 16-megapixel one Battery is non removable and comparatively smaller No Android Nougat right out of the box Not certified for dust or water resistance. The Samsung Galaxy A series is popular for offering a nice balance between specs and price tag and now there is a new smartphone in the series to talk about, the Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017). Nothing has been officially confirmed yet, but there are rumors that this phone won’t be available in Europe officially. As its predecessor followed these footsteps as well it’s not really a surprise. Before we get to the specs and other details of this phone, let’s take a look at the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Qatar price first. It should be available for about 2000 QAR when it’s here. There are some great phones available in this pricing range so let’s see if it will be a good idea to wait for the Samsung Galaxy A 2017 release date Qatar or not.. Compared to the 2016 version, there is not much to look forward to when it comes to the display. It’s the same 5.5-inch screen protected by Gorilla Glass 4 which will be showing 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution which means the same screen size with same resolution. It will also include Gorilla Glass 4 back panel. As nothing is official at the moment it’s too early to talk about the design but no major change is expected. Just like the Samsung Galaxy A7 2016 version, there are four different colors to look forward to after the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 release date: Pink, Gold, White and Black.. One of the best feature of this upcoming phone is the addition of a 16-megapixel camera. Surprisingly both the front and rear camera will be a 16-megapixel one which is a big jump from the 5-megapixel front camera and 13-megapixel rear camera. Users will be able to capture 1080p videos using both front and back camera. For those who are interested to buy the best camera phone available at the moment can check out the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL. However, these are quite expensive compared to the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Qatar price.. Under the hood, the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 is packing Exynos 7870 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM. Unfortunately it will be running Android Marshmallow operating system instead of the latest Android Nougat. If you believe the 32/64GB built-in storage is not enough for you it can be expanded to up to 256GB using the microSD card slot. All the necessary connectivity options are there with other notable features like fingerprint scanner and NFC. We don’t know much about the size of the battery but it will include fast battery charging. For those who are interested in a phone that offers big battery, there is the Asus Zenfone Max 2016 and Lenovo Vibe P1 .. As mentioned earlier, nothing has been officially unveiled yet including the release date. However, if you are interested to buy this phone after learning the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Qatar price, you can start looking out for this phone in December, 2016..

Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) offers a premium design and look, but at a mid-range price. In terms of design, Galaxy A7 stands out from the competition in the market.

Galaxy A7 has 3D curved glass all over.. Updated: May 6, 2017 8:29 am. Samsung Galaxy S9, S9+: Nicer camera, static design, higher. price Samsung Galaxy S9, Galaxy S9+ expected price, release date: India pre-booking at Rs. 2000 Samsung Galaxy S9, Galaxy S9+ First impressions and. Samsung Galaxy A series is all about offering a premium experience, but at a mid-range pricing. But, lately, the competition has gotten really tough in this price band. OnePlus 3T , in particular, has set the benchmark for what consumers have come to expect in a smartphone priced under Rs 35,000. Then, of course, there’s the parade of selfie smartphones taking over the Indian market.. So can Samsung’s Galaxy A7 (2017) series stand up to the competition? Here’s what we thought after our review.. Specifications: 5.7-inch FHD sAMOLED | Exynos 7880 64bit octa-core processor at 1.9Ghz | 3 GB + 32 GB microSD Slot (expandable to 256GB) | 16MP rear camera with f/1.9 aperture + 16MP front camera | 3600 mAh battery with Type-C USB | Android 6.0.1 | Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 full specs. Galaxy A phones sport a metal, glass body like the more premium S series. I’ve reviewed the Galaxy A7 phone in the past, and it was a phone I liked. The Galaxy A (2017) gold version we got sports a premium, all-glass and metal body design. It has 3D curved glass all around with a metal frame, and there’s a Type-C USB port at the bottom with the headphone jack next to it.. The volume rockers are on the left side of the device with a single nano-SIM slot. The power button is on the right. The second SIM slot along with a separate microSD slot is placed on top of the device. The rear camera doesn’t jut out at all on the Galaxy A7 (2017). Samsung could have made this phone a bit sleeker, but it’s not such a big problem.. In terms of design, Galaxy A7 stands out from the competition in the market. All glass on the front and back. ensures that this phone looks beautiful. The only fallout is the body is prone to scratches and smudges. You will need a cover or tempered glass to protect it. Also, the phone can be a bit slippery.. Galaxy A7 for 2017 sports a slightly bigger 5.7-inch display, but with the same Full HD resolution, and this is a SAMOLED one. This is one area where Samsung’s supremacy remains unbeaten, and the Galaxy A7 doesn’t falter at all.. The screen is crisp, the colours are vivid, and overall this is the best display you can get at this price point. I used this phone to consume a lot of videos on YouTube primarily, and the overall experience was great.. On the performance front, Galaxy A7 (2017) sports the Samsung’s own Exynos 7880 octa-core processor clocked at 1.9 Ghz coupled with 3GB RAM and a total of 32GB onboard storage. Galaxy A7 can handle multi-tasking quite easily, heavy duty graphics games are not a problem on this. It doesn’t quite set the benchmark tests on fire, but that doesn’t mean the general performance suffers.. On the UI front, the Galaxy A7 has some of Samsung’s own features like the split-screen, the ability to take much longer screenshots, customising them, etc.. Camera is where the Galaxy A series has consistently performed better than some of the rivals. Just like the previous phone, Galaxy A7 delivers some exceptional shots. I quite liked how it captured a street in Bangkok, and even some of the shots inside my house at night. The colour reproduction is great, and the pictures have enough details. The front camera should likewise appeal to most folks.. On the battery side, Galaxy A7 scored 8 hours plus in the PC Mark test for us. The phone can easily last a day with heavy duty usage. There were days when I used this device to listen to music all day, and I still had some battery left by the time I got home.. The other positive for the Galaxy A7 will be the IP68 water and dust resistant rating, which you are unlikely to get on any other phone in this price segment.. The glass back is beautiful, but it is prone to scratches, and I’ve noticed two deep scratches already. Then I would say the low-light performance of the Galaxy A7 is nothing outstanding.. I expected a drastic improvement from the last generation, and when I’m comparing photos, 2017 doesn’t seem like a gigantic leap. Details are missing in low-light shots, which is disappointing, to say the least. Plus the lack of 4K recording, slow motion at this price point is not good enough.. Samsung could have loaded this one with more powerful speakers. Also, 2017 is here, but no Android Nougat from Samsung. Finally, the 32GB storage will disappoint most users.. Yes, you can add this to your buy list, if you’re okay with the old version of Android. The highlight of this phone is the camera and the display, which is still unmatched by other players. The water and dust resistant capabilities. are extra positives, something the other phones don’t offer.. However, the competition is tough for the Galaxy A7, especially if you consider OnePlus 3T, which has set the bar in this category, thanks to the premium performance and specifications. Which one you pick will boil down on how comfortable you are trying out a newer brand.. For all the latest Technology News , download Indian Express App. © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd.

Samsung A7 2017 Is Good Condition......Only 1000 sr. Disclaimer: Prices are updated on a daily basis and may have changed since the last update.. Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Review. Price of the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia 5.5-inch Super AMOLED Display 16-Megapixel Rear Camera Exynos 7870 Octa-core Processor Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Release Date Saudi Arabia Decent octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM Great display with Gorilla Glass 4 protection Both the front and rear camera is a 16-megapixel one Battery is non removable and comparatively smaller No Android Nougat right out of the box Not certified for dust or water resistance. The Samsung Galaxy A series is popular for offering a nice balance between specs and price tag and now there is a new smartphone in the series to talk about, the Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017). Nothing has been officially confirmed yet, but there are rumors that this phone won’t be available in Europe officially. As its predecessor followed these footsteps as well it’s not really a surprise. Before we get to the specs and other details of this phone, let’s take a look at the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Saudi Arabia price first. It should be available for about 2000 SAR when it’s here. There are some great phones available in this pricing range so let’s see if it will be a good idea to wait for the Samsung Galaxy A 2017 release date Saudi Arabia or not.. Compared to the 2016 version, there is not much to look forward to when it comes to the display. It’s the same 5.5-inch screen protected by Gorilla Glass 4 which will be showing 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution which means the same screen size with same resolution. It will also include Gorilla Glass 4 back panel. As nothing is official at the moment it’s too early to talk about the design but no major change is expected. Just like the Samsung Galaxy A7 2016 version, there are four different colors to look forward to after the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 release date: Pink, Gold, White and Black.. One of the best feature of this upcoming phone is the addition of a 16-megapixel camera. Surprisingly both the front and rear camera will be a 16-megapixel one which is a big jump from the 5-megapixel front camera and 13-megapixel rear camera. Users will be able to capture 1080p videos using both front and back camera. For those who are interested to buy the best camera phone available at the moment can check out the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL. However, these are quite expensive compared to the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Saudi Arabia price.. Under the hood, the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 is packing Exynos 7870 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM. Unfortunately it will be running Android Marshmallow operating system instead of the latest Android Nougat. If you believe the 32/64GB built-in storage is not enough for you it can be expanded to up to 256GB using the microSD card slot. All the necessary connectivity options are there with other notable features like fingerprint scanner and NFC. We don’t know much about the size of the battery but it will include fast battery charging. For those who are interested in a phone that offers big battery, there is the Asus Zenfone Max 2016 and Lenovo Vibe P1 .. As mentioned earlier, nothing has been officially unveiled yet including the release date. However, if you are interested to buy this phone after learning the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Saudi Arabia price, you can start looking out for this phone in December, 2016..

Please ask the question in above box. Which phone is better A7 2017 or C9 Pro?. The Galaxy C9 Pro has a 1.44GHz octa-core Snapdragon 653 coupled with 6GB of RAM and 64GB internal storage. On the other hand, the Galaxy A7 (2017) runs Exynos 7880 with 3GB of RAM and 32GB internal storage. However, the A7 (2017) comes with IP68 certification to protect it from dust and water. Though both phones have nearly identical hardware, Galaxy C9 Pro with 4000 mAh battery is certainly better than the A7.. I think A7 is better as it is water resistant and has flagship like unique design with NFC support.. Of course, C9 Pro is an ultimate Android mobile, so I suggest you go for C9 Pro..

No, it doesn't have face unlock feature.. Does it come with a fast charger or not?. No, it doesn't come with a fast charger.. Which one is better between Samsung Galaxy A7 and Oneplus 5?.

Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) and Galaxy A5 (2017) Review. Roydon Cerejo , 26 July 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Galaxy A7 (2017) and Galaxy A5 (2017) are IP68 certified. The phones also support Samsung Pay and S Bike mode. The A7 is priced at Rs. 30,900 while the A5 is priced at Rs. Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) and Galaxy A5 (2017) design Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) and Galaxy A5 (2017) specifications and features Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) and Galaxy A5 (2017) performance, cameras, and battery life Verdict. Samsung’s Galaxy A series is positioned as the next best thing to the flagship Galaxy S series. The idea here is to provide an almost. top-level experience, which encompasses the feel of the device, features, and of course. performance, but at a price that more people can stomach. So far, the company has done a good job of maintaining this balance, and now, it’s time to take the 2017 editions of the Galaxy A7 and Galaxy A5 for a spin.. These new smartphones went on sale in India back in March, and based on our initial encounter with them, they seemed like they could be serious contenders in the mid-range smartphone space. 26,900 for the Galaxy A7 (2017) and the Galaxy A5 (2017) respectively, the two go up against the Moto Z2 Play. ( Review ), OnePlus 5. ( Review ), Honor 8 Pro. Let's see how they stack up.. The two new smartphones are virtually identical in terms of design and features. 4,000 for the Galaxy A7 (2017), you get a bigger display and a larger battery. For the sake of simplicity, all our analysis in this review applies to both model, unless stated otherwise.. Samsung has done an excellent job with the build quality as the metal and glass blend seamlessly together, which feels really good when you hold either of the two. The aluminium frame on the sides isn’t slippery, and adds a rich finish to the phones, just like with last year's models. Both models have edge-curved Gorilla Glass 4 along with glass on the back. The edges of the back are curved inwards, much like the design on the Samsung Galaxy S7 .. However, the backs of the phones look. too bland, and one could easily mistake these for budget-level phones from this angle.. There are volume buttons to the left and a power button to the right. The phones' mono loudspeakers have been shifted to the right side, above the power buttons. This is a bit of an odd place to put them, but the advantage is that the speakers aren't blocked even when you’re holding these phones in landscape mode for gaming or watching videos.. There are visible antenna bands at the top and bottom of the phones, and the USB Type-C ports and headphone sockets are at the bottom. Like before, both phones have dedicated slots for a microSD card (up to 256GB) along with two Nano-SIM slots, which we appreciate. One big flagship-class feature that is new is IP68 water and dust resistance.. The big differences between the two, physically, are their size and weight. The Galaxy A5 (2017) is a lot more manageable for one-handed use with its 5.2-inch screen, and isn’t too heavy at 157 grams. The Galaxy A7 (2017) on the other hand feels bulky and heavy at 186 grams and isn't the best suited for one-handed use with its larger 5.7-inch screen.. Both models have Super AMOLED displays and both have the same 1080x1920 pixel resolution. This makes edges and text in the OS appear slightly less sharp on the Galaxy A7 compared to the Galaxy A5. We also found that our Galaxy A5 (2017) review unit had slightly crisper whites and punchier colours compared to the Galaxy A7 (2017) sample, which exhibited paler whites and slightly muted colours.. We have a physical home button below the displays on both phones, with two capacitive buttons on either side. The fingerprint sensors are fast at authentication and we like that you don’t have to press the button to unlock the phone, as they work. In each phone's box, you get a stereo headset, travel adapter, charging cable, and user guide. Overall, the new Galaxy A7 and Galaxy A5 stay true to their premium identities. The A5 is definitely more manageable in your hand, so the choice can come down to a tradeoff between screen size and ease of use.. Samsung has fitted both smartphones with pretty much the same internals. Processing is handled by an Exynos 7880 octa-core SoC and 3GB of RAM. This SoC is a nice upgrade from the Exynos 7580 in last year's A-series models, with a smaller 14nm fabrication process and faster Mali-T830 GPU. It uses ARM’s big.LITTLE CPU architecture to bring together four Cortex-A72 cores and four Cortex-A53 cores.. Compared to a Qualcomm's equivalent Snapdragon 626 which is used in phones such as the Moto Z2 Play, the Exynos 7880 seems to have a better GPU, but CPU performance seem. We got a score of 33fps in GFXbench, while other benchmarks that measure overall performance were a bit of a mixed bag with AnTuTu and PCMark favouring the Qualcomm chip while Quadrant went in the Exynos’ favour.. The rest of the specifications include 32GB of storage, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC and MST for Samsung Pay, GPS, FM radio, USB-OTG, and a suite of sensors which include a gyroscope, barometer, and hall sensor, plus the usual ones.. In terms of software, both smartphones are still on a custom version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. However, this is only temporary as Samsung appears to have completed its Wi-Fi certification process for an upcoming update, which clearly shows the version as Android 7. The look and feel of the interface in general is very similar to that of. the Galaxy S7 series and the more recent Galaxy C9 Pro and Galaxy C7 Pro.. You can enable the ‘Always On’ display feature which is very handy if you want a constant overview of your unread notifications. You get Google's apps as well as Microsoft’s Office suite and Samsung’s own apps such as My Galaxy, USB Backup, and S Secure. Samsung offers you a choice of whether or not to install. its own apps first setup the phone, so you aren’t forced to live with redundant apps. You can always download them later from Galaxy Apps store.. There are also a tonne of little features added to the Settings app like Smart Network Switch, which. automatically switches between mobile data and Wi-Fi depending the strength of each; a blue. light filter in the display settings; an SOS trigger called Panic mode; and Game Launcher for in-game screen captures and recording. Samsung’s Secure Folder feature lets you use both phones' fingerprint sensors to lock. apps, accounts, files, notes, and even contacts. You also get 15GB of Samsung Cloud storage for backing up contacts, notes, browser data, and the gallery.. The UI has a notifications toggle called S Bike mode, which has been a popular feature in the company’s Galaxy J series lineup. Once activated, a big S Bike button takes over the entire screen, preventing you from using the phone. a voice message which tells them that the phone's owner is riding a bike, and if it’s an urgent call, they. can press ‘1’ on their diallers to force the call through.. Samsung Pay is another very useful addition to both phones and it works very well. We tried this out and save for a few restaurants, it worked in most places.. App and interface performance is very good on both smartphones. Despite the heavy UI customisations, we rarely encountered hiccups with animations or multitasking. However, gaming performance isn’t the best. While games like Implosion and Marvel Spider-Man Unlimited run smoothly, heavier games like Breakneck and Asphalt 8 had intermittent choppy frame rates. The good news is that the phones don't get excessively hot during prolonged gaming sessions. 4G works well and VoLTE is also supported. Both phones also survived exposure to rain without any problems.. We’ve rarely had complaints about the media capabilities of Samsung's smartphones, and that stays true with these units. The stock video player can handle 4K playback, and you can do other fun stuff too like create six-second GIFs from any portion of a video. Picture-in-picture mode is supported, and you have the ability to edit videos (although this didn’t work on our 4K test clips). The loudspeakers are quite weak for media files and some games, but they're okay for alerts.. Both smartphones have the exact same cameras. At the back, the Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) and Galaxy A5 (2017) have 16-megapixel sensors with an f/1.9 aperture, and in the front there are also 16-megapixel. fixed-focus cameras with the same aperture. For stills in daylight, both phones take a good second to lock focus. If you happen to move even slightly, you can see the focus readjusting. During our tests, we found it nearly impossible to get a properly focused shot of moving subjects such as pets.. Landscapes appeared flat with no depth, and close-ups were tricky too. We struggled with macro shots, and more often than not, we ended up with soft focus or blurry shots because either we or our subjects moved a bit. The level of detail is shots was pretty average too, and our sample photos ended up looking a bit underexposed. used here is a Samsung S5K3P8, which frankly just doesn’t cut it at this price point.. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) sample images. In low light, the large aperture does a good job at keeping noise under control, as you end up with bright and well lit images if there's decent ambient light. However, this also subdues most of the detail in shots. The front cameras have the same resolution but selfies aren’t sharp and lack detail.. The camera app is easy to use but isn’t the most practical. For starters, there’s no Auto HDR mode, which is now common in most camera apps. To get to HDR, you need to swipe right to pull up the camera modes and then select it, which isn't convenient.. Pro mode is poorly implemented too, as you can only select a maximum sensitivity of ISO 800 and there’s no shutter speed control, which makes it useless in low light.. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) sample images. Video recording maxes out at 1080p, which is not very good considering 4K video recording is doable on mainstream phones these days. Autofocus works quite well in video mode and is relatively good at shifting focus between subjects. There’s no stabilisation here, so you will want to restrict your movements when shooting. Other than Hyperlapse video mode, there are no effects or slow motion modes to choose from. You have the option to download more shooting modes but there are literally just two of them to download.. The Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) features a 3600mAh battery while the A5 (2017) has a 3000mAh battery. In our HD video loop test, we managed to get good runtimes on both phones, with the A5 stretching to 16 hours, 21 minutes and the A7 going up to 17 hours, 14 minutes. We managed to get a full day’s worth of usage from the A5, with A7 giving us up to a day and half. Both phones support Samsung’s Adaptive Charging and in our tests, we managed to get up to about 80 percent in little more than an hour.. Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) and Galaxy A5 (2017) in pictures. Samsung’s latest A-series offerings hit the right notes when it comes to build quality and design. The Galaxy A7 (2017) and Galaxy A5 (2017) look and feel incredibly premium, just like their predecessors. We’re not big fans of the look of the backs, but then that’s just us nitpicking.. Between the two, the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) is the one we’d recommend. Camera performance is a bit weak and some high-end games don’t have smooth. framerates, but in return, you get good battery life, a vivid display and handy features like S Bike mode and Samsung Pay. The price feels a bit on the higher side considering overall performance, but the IP68 certification is appealing.. On the other hand, we don’t seen any worthwhile reason to pick up the Galaxy A7 (2017) at Rs. 30,900 as you aren’t getting anything more for this premium other than a slightly. larger battery and a bigger screen. at the cost of ergonomics, as the A7 is heavier and bulkier. Here, you’re better off with the Honor 8 Pro or the OnePlus 5 .. For the latest smartphone launches by Samsung, Nokia, Sony, Asus, and other MWC 2018 announcements, visit our MWC hub ..

Disclaimer: Prices are updated on a daily basis and may have changed since the last update.. Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Review. Price of the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 in Dubai, UAE 5.5-inch Super AMOLED Display 16-Megapixel Rear Camera Exynos 7870 Octa-core Processor Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Release Date UAE Decent octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM Great display with Gorilla Glass 4 protection Both the front and rear camera is a 16-megapixel one Battery is non removable and comparatively smaller No Android Nougat right out of the box Not certified for dust or water resistance. The Samsung Galaxy A series is popular for offering a nice balance between specs and price tag and now there is a new smartphone in the series to talk about, the Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017). Nothing has been officially confirmed yet, but there are rumors that this phone won’t be available in Europe officially. As its predecessor followed these footsteps as well it’s not really a surprise. Before we get to the specs and other details of this phone, let’s take a look at the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Dubai price first. It should be available for about AED 2000 when it’s here. There are some great phones available in this pricing range so let’s see if it will be a good idea to wait for the Samsung Galaxy A 2017 release date UAE or not.. Compared to the 2016 version, there is not much to look forward to when it comes to the display. It’s the same 5.5-inch screen protected by Gorilla Glass 4 which will be showing 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution which means the same screen size with same resolution. It will also include Gorilla Glass 4 back panel. As nothing is official at the moment it’s too early to talk about the design but no major change is expected. Just like the Samsung Galaxy A7 2016 version, there are four different colors to look forward to after the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 release date: Pink, Gold, White and Black.. One of the best feature of this upcoming phone is the addition of a 16-megapixel camera. Surprisingly both the front and rear camera will be a 16-megapixel one which is a big jump from the 5-megapixel front camera and 13-megapixel rear camera. Users will be able to capture 1080p videos using both front and back camera. For those who are interested to buy the best camera phone available at the moment can check out the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL. However, these are quite expensive compared to the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Dubai price.. Under the hood, the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 is packing Exynos 7870 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM. Unfortunately it will be running Android Marshmallow operating system instead of the latest Android Nougat. If you believe the 32/64GB built-in storage is not enough for you it can be expanded to up to 256GB using the microSD card slot. All the necessary connectivity options are there with other notable features like fingerprint scanner and NFC. We don’t know much about the size of the battery but it will include fast battery charging. For those who are interested in a phone that offers big battery, there is the Asus Zenfone Max 2016 and Lenovo Vibe P1 .. As mentioned earlier, nothing has been officially unveiled yet including the release date. However, if you are interested to buy this phone after learning the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Dubai price, you can start looking out for this phone in December, 2016.. Things we loved about the Samsung Galaxy A7 2016:. Things we didn’t like about the phone:. Galaxy A7 2017 Dual Sim 32 4G. 1161.9 AED AED 1126.9000244140625 with offer.

Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) review: Fabulous screen, not the CPU Riyana Lama | Gadgets Now | Updated: Jun 30, 2017, 07.00PM IST. After the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, Samsung has been really careful about their next smartphone launches.. *Brilliant Super AMOLED display *Adaptive Fast Charging *IP68 Water and dust resistance. After the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco,. has been really careful about their next smartphone launches. The upgraded A7 (2017) has a couple of new features that its predecessor lacked. In addition, the company recently refreshed the C-series by launching the C7 Pro and C9 Pro as well. All these smartphones have more or less similar specifications, and the prices don't differ that much either.. We spent some time with the Galaxy A7 (2017), which has a price tag of Rs 33,490, to see how it's different from the A7 (2016) and what new features it comes with. Here's the rest of our review.. Lower end Samsung looking almost the same to one another is not a new thing, the. is also just a refined version its predecessor. The Galaxy A7 (2017) has rounded curved edges with a matte-finished frame and a shiny 3D glass back panel. The antenna bands are neatly placed on the frame, with the combo SIM 2/microSD card tray located on the top. The SIM 1 tray is placed on the lower left side of the frame, aligned vertically with the volume controls. On the right is the power button with the speaker grille. As for the bottom, itâ€™s where a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm audio jack are located. As for the front panel, it has a 5.7-inch display, below which thereâ€™s a Home button with an integrated fingerprint sensor. The selfie camera and earpiece, as expected, are placed above the display.. The A7 is dust and water resistant, but still manages to look beautiful with a flush 3D-glass body. It has a certain weight to it which makes it feel nice and premium when held in the hand. The only problem is that if you have sweaty hands, it might slip out of your hands quite often.. The 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display of the Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) is brilliant, and makes watching Full HD videos a delight. Colour reproduction of the display is accurate and viewing angles are on point as well.. The Galaxy A7 (2017) is powered by Samsungâ€™s own Exynos 7870 octa-core processor, clocked at 1.9GHz. This is backed up by 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, with support for microSD cards of up to 256GB in size.. Out-of-the-box, the smartphone runs dated Android 6.0 Marshmallow but itâ€™ll probably get the Android 7.0 Nougat update sometime later this year.. The reason why the Galaxy A7 (2017) is heavy is because it packs a sizeable 3,600mAh battery. Itâ€™s also IP68-certified, which means that you wonâ€™t have to worry about it getting splashed with water every now and then. In addition, the smartphone can resist the entry of foreign solid/liquid objects for up to 30minutes at 1.5m.. During our time with the device, we ran a few benchmark tests. The Galaxy A7 (2017) scored 785 (single-core) and 4,262 (multi-core) on GeekBench 4, while AnTuTu score was 58,976.. On the performance front, we found the Galaxy A7 (2017) to be decent. We tried a bunch of heavy games like WWE: Immortals and Justice League, and they all ran smoothly. However, the phone did heat up a little during prolonged gaming. Browsing with multiple Chrome tabs open and random app switching wasnâ€™t a problem either. That said, some apps like Facebook and Instagram crashed too often.. We found the fingerpint sensor to be quite snappy. Just place your finger on it and the phone unlocks super fast. Call quality was fine during our testing too, and the only time it dropped was in areas with weak network coverage. The smartphone comes with dual nano-SIM support.. Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) packs a 3,600mAh battery with Adaptive fast charging technology. Even if thereâ€™s just 5% of battery left before you have to leave for work, just plug it in for about 15 minutes and the smartphone will have enough juice to last for about 3-4 hours.. As for the software, the TouchWiz UI layer looks and works similarly on the A7 (2017), as it does on any other Samsung smartphone. There are rounded, colourful icons, as well as a bunch of preloaded apps that canâ€™t be uninstalled, just disabled. The only thing is that the UI instantly makes the A7 (2017) recognizable as a Samsung smartphone, as itâ€™s nothing like stock Android. Apart from that thereâ€™s nothing unique that the TouchWiz brings to the table.. Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) supports the companyâ€™s Samsung Pay digital payments solution, which was recently launched in India. But since the service is in its initial phase, we couldnâ€™t test it out.. Lastly, letâ€™s talk about the cameras. The Galaxy A7 (2017) has a 16MP rear camera with f/1.9 aperture that can record Full HD (1080p) resolution videos at 30fps. During our testing, we found the camera to be great. It takes impressive-looking pictures with sharp and vibrant colours. Even in low-light settings, the details captured are quite good.. The selfie camera is identical to the primary one and ha the same 16MP resolution and f/1.9 aperture. We found the pictures taken from the front camera to be decent. It kind of flushes the natural colours and makes the Whites beyond natural. But overall, itâ€™s good for casual photography.. Priced at Rs 33,490, the Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) checks nearly all the right boxes when it comes to the specs and performance. But, there are a few hits and misses, especially when compared to other. , all of which are nearly the same with minimal variation(s) in price. The C9 Pro is notablyâ€™s Samsungâ€™s first smartphone to have 6GB of RAM.. Our point is that if youâ€™re already going to spend about 33k on a smartphone, you should rather go for the top-end (128GB internal storage) variant of the OnePlus 3T, which not only has 6GB of RAM, but also a flagship Snapdragon 821 processor and a near-stock Android-like experience.. But if what you want is a Samsung, you can even go for the Galaxy C7 Pro, which has the same display as the A7 (2017) and slightly-more RAM, all at a lower price of Rs 27,990.. Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+ launched at Rs 57,900 onwards. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus smartphones are available for pre-orders exclusively on Flipkart and will start shipping soon.. Samsung eyes comeback with Galaxy S8.

Go for it if you want a decent mid-range phone with big vibrant display and a premium finish. Else, there are better options available for power users.. Design Display Hardware/ Performance  Software Battery life Camera Verdict. The 2017 version of Samsung Galaxy A7 is a stylish phone that does perform well. The hardware specifications are not top-class though; the A7 stands out as one of the best mid-range phones from Samsung. First off, the design of A7 looks premium and it does offer a slew of reasons to not move past it. But that does not mean it’s a muscular contender in the crowded mid-range smartphone market which is ruled by OnePlus 3T.. We all want our phones to be compact in size and sleek in look, easy-fit to our palm all while yearning for a display big enough to watch videos. I didn’t face any performance issue in over a week of using the A7 but one major letdown is its size given that it’s not a pleasing fit for most hands. It’s almost way too fiddly to handle it one-handed. However, the brilliant full-HD display of A7 makes its content look vivid under intense sunlight.. The Galaxy A7 features a decent 3600mAh battery and it comes with handy power-saving options.One of the features that make the Galaxy A7 stand out from the competition is its IP68 dust and water resistance rating. This means that the device is protected against foreign objects and ingress of water at up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes.. Overall, Galaxy A7 flaunts a trendy look and offers a decent battery life, water and dust resistance, and a vibrant always on display. Let’s dig deep into the details to find more including how it stacks up against the competition.. Galaxy A series phone sports a robust metal and curved-glass build and looks much like the Galaxy S7. The device is a little heavier at 186 grams as compared to 172 grams of A7 of 2016. The phone with its 5.7-inch display and 156.8 x 77.6 x 7.9 mm dimensions feel pleasant to hold. The A7 of 2017 got a size bump up to 5.7 from the A7 of 2016 which had a 5.5-inch display. With bezel-less design being the new trend, this phone boasts a thin groove and bezels are slim. The front of the screen shows off the big glass even from a distance. Hence, guarding it against any harm such as a scratch or a drop-off would warrant a little extra protection. This also essentially translates to an enhanced video viewing experience for the regular YouTube viewers.. The hardware buttons of the A7 2017 edition stay intact. The headphone jack is at the bottom and the hybrid dual-SIM slot is on top. The speaker is repositioned and is side-mounted above the power button. I found it little odd because every time you watch a video in landscape mode, you end up covering the speaker as you hold the device.. The Always On Display (AOD) is a new feature found in Samsung A series smartphones. The feature comes handy to keep up with notifications without unlocking your device time and again. AOD displays date, time, and battery percentage. You can configure it to show two different time zones, change the look and feel, and the content to show on screen.. The Galaxy A7 features a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED Full HD display with a 386 ppi pixel density. You’ll find that the colors pop very nicely and that the display has nice viewing angles. ‘Adaptive Display’ mode is enabled by default; you can change it, to optimise the color range, saturation and the sharpness of your display, to ‘AMOLED cinema’ to ‘AMOLED photo’ to ‘Basic’ mode. The display is bright even in broad daylight under direct sunlight.. The Galaxy A7 is a package from Samsung which features IP68 certification, micro-SD card support, 32GB of internal storage and a noteworthy 3,600mAh battery. However, with 3GB of RAM and Samsung's mid-range Exynos 7880 SoC, Galaxy A7 is no comparison with OnePlus 3T which has high-end Snapdragon 821 and 6GB RAM.. The device is capable enough to handle multiple opened tabs in Chrome and a few app and game windows in the background, without any substantial heating issue. But when I played Asphalt Nitro, I did experience sluggish response and mild heating issue. So if you are not a crazy multitasker or gamer, the A7 will readily serve your needs without any hitch.. Fingerprint sensor doesn’t respond many a times when the device screen is turned off and it falters too often than you would expect. My 14-month old Huawei Honor 7 didn’t ever let face such as erratic fingerprint reading.. The Galaxy A7 on runs on Samsung's TouchWiz UI running on top of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow which is little disappointing, but Samsung has started rolling out the Nougat update for the handset. A7 comes with two browsers –Samsung’s own and Google Chrome, multiple photo and music apps. The phone also bundles Microsoft’s applications. So the suite of apps from Microsoft, Samsung and Google make the app ecosystem little clunky and the fact that you can’t install most of these apps is even more exasperating.. Software features of the Galaxy A7 include by default the Secure Folder, S Bike Mode, Device maintenance, Blue light filter, and more. There are several advanced features that help automate a lot of tasks. Start stay allows preventing the display backlight from turning off while you are looking at the display. You can set the device to launch the camera by pressing the Home key twice. Smart capture allows you to capture content across multiple screens. Direct call function helps making call by picking up the device near your ear while viewing call, message or contact details. By using palm motions or turning the device screen downwards, you can mute incoming calls or alarms. However, accelerometer and proximity sensors at times seem to be slow.. The Samsung Galaxy A7 of 2017 comes with a slightly bigger 3,600mAh battery than that of the king in mid-range segment --the OnePlus 3T, which has a 3,400mAh battery. The battery backup is decent and readily lasts for a day. The device supports fast charging technology such as Samsung’s Adaptive feature or Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0.. You can further extend the battery life using the Medium and Max power saving modes that limit device performance by reducing CPU speed, preventing background data. I found this functionality really helpful.. Samsung Galaxy A7 comes with a 16-megapixel camera with an aperture of f/1.9, autofocus and an LED flash on the back and a 16-megapixel f/1.9 camera on the front. For those who want to upgrade from last year’s Galaxy A7, the new A7’s camera performance could make you feel good.. In daylight, the camera performs well enough with crisp and vibrant images with certain level of detail. However, images taken in low light aren’t vibrant at all which is little disappointing. The camera offers Panorama, a Pro mode with advanced settings, Hyperlapse, HDR, Night, and Food modes by default, along with Auto.. The 16-megapixel front camera of Galaxy A7 is capable of taking lively pictures and will entice to selfie lovers. The A7 is capable of recording Full HD video.. The upgraded version of A7 offers you more than one would expect. Overall, this is a stylish phone with a vibrant display and the fact that it offers you dust and water resistance is commendable. However, if you want the best midrange phone, there's no avoiding the OnePlus 3T.. You can unsubscribe at any time and we'll never share your details without your permission..

Samsung has integrated the IP68 water and dust resistance to the Galaxy A7 (2017). Notably, the flagship and best smartphone of last year, Galaxy S7 Edge too comes with the same rating..
