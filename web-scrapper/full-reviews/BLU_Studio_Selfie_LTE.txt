The BLU Studio Selfie LTE sports a 5-inch FWVGA display, 1.1 GHz quad-core processor, 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of storage and two 5-megapixel cameras.. Dimensions: 5.62 x 2.87 x 0.34 inches (142.76 x 72.9 x 8.75 mm). Weight: 5.47 oz (155 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 480 x 854 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Quad-core, 1100 MHz, ARM Cortex-A7, 32-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 24.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 25.0 days (600 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 14.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 20.8 days (500 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 17, 20.

Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Features: Mass storage device, USB charging. Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

BLU Studio Selfie LTE coming to T-Mobile, will support band 12 and VoLTE. BLU Products frequently targets T-Mobile customers with their unlocked phones, but the problem is that those devices often lack fully compatibility with T-Mobile’s LTE network. That’s not the case with the Studio Selfie LTE, a new phone from BLU that’s fully certified by T-Mobile and will be sold by T-Mo dealers.. Phone Scoop recently spent some time with the BLU Studio Selfie LTE, and as you might guess, its main feature is a 5-megapixel front-facing camera that also sports an LED flash. The rest of the Studio Selfie LTE is described as “very generic,” offering a 5-inch display that’s “perfectly average” and a 5-megapixel rear camera that didn’t really leave a solid first impression.. The body of the Studio Selfie LTE is white and plastic, and the rear cover has a matte finish. You can also remove the back cover to reveal the card slots. Finally, the software on the Studio Selfie is vanilla Android with few meaningful changes from BLU.. Most notable to T-Mobile customers is that, since the Studio Selfie is certified by T-Mobile, it includes support for band 12 LTE as well as Voice over LTE (VoLTE). T-Mo has been pushing band 12 LTE (aka Extended Range LTE ) in a big way lately, which is no surprise since it offers farther reach and better building penetration than its other flavors of LTE, so it’s nice to see a BLU device that supports it.. The BLU Studio Selfie LTE will cost $99, but today’s report makes no mention of when it’ll launch, and neither BLU nor T-Mobile appear to have made any announcements about the phone at the time of this writing. As for the Studio Selfie LTE itself, the handset doesn’t sound like it’s going to impress anyone looking for a high-end device or anything like that. At just $99, though, it seems like a perfectly respectable option for someone that just wants an affordable Android phone.. For more photos of the BLU Studio Selfie LTE, hit up the link below..

View all posts by Alex Wagner →. ← T-Mobile’s odds of success at 600MHz auction growing as some smaller carriers become hesitant to take part. FCC releases opening bid information for 600MHz spectrum auction →. Any Tech specs available for this phone?. As I mention in the post, I haven’t found any official announcements from BLU or T-Mobile for this Studio Selfie LTE. Today’s hands-on report mentions that the phone has 5-megapixel front and rear cameras, a 5-inch display, and Android, and it looks like it’s got a microSD slot, too.. Just look at Blu’s Official website. Hey Alex, is there any phone that’s not sold by T-Mobile supports VoLTE, wifi-calling, and B12. Is VoLTE certification done by the government or T-Mobile, why don’t more unlocked phones have it, and can you give a general ballpark figure of the fee to get certified.. Up until Marshmallow makes a proper release that’s the only potential for B12/voLTE/WiFi calling. So for now the new Nexus, pending approval. T-Mobile specific due to E911 on B12 voLTE, as far as I know. It’s pricey/annoying to do it for a single network for the companies releasing unlocked devices. I’m assuming because no company has confirmed anything.. If its a per device fee that could add up quickly to support one network, but if it’s a one-time fee maybe T-Mobile should give discount to smaller companies like BLU.. T-Mobile has said that any phone using its band 12 coverage must also support VoLTE and E911, to do so they have to go through T-Mobile’s certification process. As for the cost to get it certified, to my knowledge there haven’t been any figures made available.. Alex, I am a MetroPCS customer on their $60 unlimited plan. I have an iPhone 6s and Band 12 works great! problem is there is NO VOLTE on my phone, it defaults to 3G when i make calls. oh and yes, there is VOLTE in my area (Akron/Canton) because I used to be a t-mobile customer with my old iphone 6.. Now you say t-mobile MUST support VOLTE if band 12 is active on a phone for E911 calls, but my iphone wont do VOLTE because metro is blocking this feature. I know metro is owned by t-mobile nut i dont understand why VOLTE isnt enable with a BYOD on metro. Mvnos often don’t support all of the features that are available to the carriers primary customer base. Lack of volte on metro is a known example.. “T-Mobile has said that any phone using its band 12 coverage must also support VoLTE and E911”. they’re NOT a MVNO and this is a security flaw. what happens if i’m out in rural America and i have a band 12 LTE signal but my phone won’t make a regular call or even worse, a 911 call? sounds like a major issue to me. Metro DONT offer volte .My friends here in Los angeles that are too cheap to get tmobile have metro branded phones galaxy s5 and yep no VOLTE phone drops down to 3G for calls. And volte is available here in LA cuz i have tmobile and my s6 edge stays on 4g lte when making calls.. That’s not true metro pcs does have volte I have it my calls never drop to 3g and im in chicago. Metro customers don’t get access to band 12/volte just like they don’t the free roaming in Mexico. If you’re stuck in the middle of nowhere with only b12 coverage and call 911 if the phone and network both support volte it’ll force the call through. If not it would use any available network (including att,verizon,sprint) to complete the call. Not a security flaw or major issue at all.. Except, metro PCs is NOT an mvno. They are directly owned by T-Mobile. Metro PCS does support B12/VoLTE, the problem is with the way iPhone APN are auto set to default. It’s been mentioned here in the past, if you buy the phone from T-Mobile. VoLTE might work and if you buy it directly from Apple, people are having difficulty getting VoLTE to work on MetroPCS.. Currently the only phones that are supposed to have full T-Mobile support (VoLTE, wifi-calling, and B12) are the new Nexus 5X and 6P. The catch is that Google might still be in the process of certifying them – they said that they would have the certification done with TMO before they ship but I have not heard that they have managed to get this done and phones are starting to ship. Nexus 6 was sold by TMO so I’m not including it. Besides the new Nexus phones, there is nothing else out there that is fully TMO compatible that I am aware of.. This one they bring? I mean, I’m glad that BLU made it’s way to a carrier store. But this phone doesn’t sound intriguing enough to try it out, Most people aren’t gonna risk it. Not to mention what little is know of the specs doesn’t sound worthy of the risk. Not to mention if it turns out to lag and stuff people are immediately go on about how BLU sucks comparing it’s performance with phones that aren’t even on the same price range, because people are like that. For cheap phones there are those like the LG Leon, I’ve even seen the HTC Desire 626s at a hundreds bucks on Bestbuy. I wish BLU would have tried to get the BLU Studio Energy 2, and market it HUGE battery and ability to charge other device; the Vivo Air LTE, and market it’s thin and elegant looking body. I mean if they where gonna go to the trouble of getting band 12 and it’s bells and whistle (VoLTE, E911, WiFi-calling) certified. They might as well do it for something more catchy. To open a better path in case they wanna bring a BLU flagship competitor. The BLU Life Pure XL was an great phone for its price and the BLU Pure XL is quite the bargain. QuadHD, Helio x10, 3G of RAM, 24MP camera and 64GB of storage for $350? Plus fingerprint sensor and NFC for those who need it. If it had B12 etc, it would be the best phone on T-Mo at that price range.. If a small company like BLU can cert this mid-ranger, what is stopping Motorola from doing it? Another reason I won’t be purchasing from them after my 2014 G.. Do anyone know if T-Mobile will fully certify the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL? It’s shown on Spectrum Gateway as “Coming Soon”.. Blu makes great cheap phones but they are the worst company at issuing android updates. I’m sure this phone will come stock with Kit Kat and a promised Lollipop update. - Any - 3G|4G U301 USB Modem Acer Aspire One Netbook Acer Liquid M220 Airave 2.5 Plus Alcatel 510A Alcatel 768 Alcatel

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

http:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=16632. Hands On with the Blu Studio Selfie for T-Mobile. Blu is a fast-growing name in the U.S. To date, they've focused on selling unlocked phone to be used with T-Mobile and MetroPCS. Now, for the first time, they are offering phones officially certified by T-Mobile, that will be sold by official T-Mobile dealers. This is increasingly important for good LTE service with T-Mobile. The Studio Selfie is the first such phone. We spent some time with it, as well as the incredibly thin Vivo Air and Studio Energy 2 with its massive battery. Read on to find out what they're like in person.. Most of Blu's phones to date have had only 3G, or only the most basic support for 4G LTE networks in the U.S.. They haven't supported all of the LTE bands necessary for full coverage and roaming. That's made us hesitant to cover or recommend Blu phones in the past. Also, Blu phones haven't been tested for hearing-aid compatibility, something required of phones sold by carriers.. The Studio Selfie is the first Blu phone to change all of that with its support for LTE band 12, and T-Mobile VoLTE certification. That makes this the first Blu phone to receive full LTE coverage and speed on T-Mobile (or Metro), while also complying with FCC regulations that ensure your ability to place a 911 call reliably. And not only is it tested for hearing aids, it's rated M4/T4, the best rating a phone can have. All of this makes us much more comfortable covering and possibly recommending this phone.. Blu's first round of phones were generic, with a low price being the main selling point. Now, they're expanding to more interesting phones, like a high-end phablet, a super-thin phone, a massive-battery phone, and... The Studio Selfie is a $99 Android phone. The "Selfie" part refers to the beefy front camera with its own warm-tone LED flash. But that's pretty much its only claim to fame. It's otherwise a very generic affordable Android phone.. The 5-inch screen is perfectly average. It's not going to impress on sharpness or viewing angle, but I've certainly seen worse. It's a decent display for most people, and for this price range.. The cameras are roughly what you might expect in a $99 phone. The 5-megapixel front camera is decent for a front camera, as one would hope for a phone with Selfie in its name. The 5-megapixel rear camera might actually be worse than the front, which is unusual in any phone. That's based on very limited time with it, but the rear camera certainly did not impress in some quick tests.. The design of the body is above-average for this price range. The front glass fits into its chrome frame nicely. The front has a high-quality appearance to it. The rest of the phone has a rare design that reminds me a bit of the more affordable Lumia phones, with a removable plastic shell that wraps around the sides. It has a very nice soft matte finish that feels nice, makes it easier to grip, and resists fingerprint smudges (to a certain degree.) It's a nice design.. The side keys are a bit flat and flush, but they're comfortable to press and work well.. The software on the Studio Selfie is pretty much standard Android; Blu doesn't customize Android in any meaningful way. The camera is based on the standard Android camera app, but with a friendly options menu and, of course, and enhanced selfie mode.. Affordable Android phones keep getting better, but few reach the $99 price point and offer something extra like good LTE and a decent front camera with flash. This looks like a contender in its price range. We look forward to reviewing it.. The Studio Selfie marks Blu's first real push into the U.S. Blu Life One X3 Adopts Metal-and-Glass Design and Packs 5,000mAh Battery. Blu Products today announced the Life One X3, a mid-range handset from the unlocked phone maker. The One X3 has a curved-edge glass screen and an aluminum frame painted in matte black.. Hands On with the Blu Vivo 5 and XL. Blu is not only a fast-growing company, they're a fast-changing one as well. Most Blu phones to date have been cheap, plastic, and loaded with plain Android.. Blu Vivo Air LTE Measures 5.1mm Thick. Blu updated the Vivo Air today to include 4G LTE for AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM providers. The Vivo Air LTE is machined from aluminum and maintains a slim profile at 5.1mm thick.. Hands-On with the Blu Studio Touch. Blu's Studio Touch is another low-cost option that's available unlocked. It's not quite as polished as the Blu R1 HD, but it has a few surprising features.. 1 GB RAM 2,000 mAh battery. Headphone Jack (3.5mm), Memory Card Slot. Subscribe to news & reviews with RSS. Review: Speck Presidio Ultra Case for iPhone X. Speck's newest case for the Apple iPhone X, the Presidio Ultra, is a three-piece kit that includes a base case, an extra bumper, and a rugged holster. If you need hardcore protection with a little bit of flexibility throughout the day, the Presidio Ultra is an interesting entry.. Review: Coolpad Revvl Plus for T-Mobile. The Revvl Plus is an affordable Android slab that delivers an enormous screen at a reasonable price point. Stand-out features include a dual-camera system for capturing bokeh-style portraits, and a fingerprint reader for security. Here is Phone Scoop's in-depth report.. Review: Tech 21 Evo Check Case for Pixel 2 XL. Tech 21's latest accessory for the Google Pixel 2 XL is the Evo Check, a three-layer case that provides protection for drops up to three meters. We put this case to the test to see if it's worth your hard-earned dollars.. Review: IK Multimedia iRig Pro I/O for iPhone. The iRig Pro I/O is a compact audio interface that lets musicians, singers, and podcasters connect their instruments or microphones to Apple iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It takes all the best features of the larger iRig Pro Duo and boils them down to the most essential tools in a highly portable package.. Hands On with the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+. Samsung's new flagship handsets, the Galaxy S9 and S9+, are here and they offer lots to be excited about. Samsung took the wining design of last year's phones and upped the ante with improvements to the chassis, cameras, and software.. Review: Kingston DataTraveler Duo Bolt for iPhone. The Kingston DataTraveler Duo Bolt is a small thumb drive that plugs into the bottom of your iPhone and saves all your photos and videos. If you're looking for a quick way to free up space on your iOS device, the DataTraveler Duo Bolt is ideal in certain situations.. Review: ZTE Avid 4 for MetroPCS. ZTE's latest low-cost handset for MetroPCS offers entry-level specs and performance. It includes a 5-inch screen, 8-megapixel camera, and Android 7 Nougat. MetroPCS customers can score this handset for next to nothing, but there might be better options. Here is Phone Scoop's in-depth review.. Review: WeBoost Drive Sleek In-Car Signal Booster. WeBoost's Drive Sleek in-vehicle signal booster amplifies wireless signals inside your car.

BLU Studio Selfie Certified For T-Mobile LTE Networks. October 16, 2015 - Written By Diego Macias. The American mobile phone manufacturer BLU has been releasing some interesting devices, not all of them stand out because of their designs or the materials used in their construction, but they usually integrate good specs for the asking price. These phones are usually sold unlocked to be used with T-Mobile and Metro PCS networks, but they offer only basic compatibility with LTE networks so full coverage or roaming are not supported. Now, T-Mobile has certified the BLU Studio Selfie LTE, so this phone can make use of all the benefits from the LTE network and will be sold by official T-Mobile dealers.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. The Studio Selfie even supports LTE band 12 and Voice over LTE (VoLTE). This band is used in the Extended Range LTE coverage which covers greater distances than other LTE airwaves, so more places can benefit from LTE connectivity and coverage inside some buildings should be better too. This coverage will be available in over 350 markets by the end of 2015. The FCC certification ensures that calls to the 911 can be established with confidence and this is also rated M4/T4 for compatibility with hearing aids.. The Studio Selfie has not been officially announced by BLU or T-Mobile, but we got to know some details about its specs and the hardware thanks to a report from PhoneScoop (source link below). Following the maker’s tradition, this seems to be a mid-range device that will be sold at $99. The build quality is supposed to be quite solid for this price range, the front is covered with glass and the matte plastic back can be removed to reveal the card slots and removable battery. The screen measures 5 inches, but its resolution is unknown, although it is said to offer decent sharpness and viewing angles. The cameras on the front and back have 5-megapixel sensors and it includes an LED flash in both sides, it seems that the front-facing camera could have a better quality than the one in the back, which is very unusual. The software looks like the stock version of Android but it includes some enhancements on the camera apps, particularly to use the selfie camera. Overall, this looks like a solid offering for the price, as it includes LTE compatibility and some nice features.. Wear Weekly: Get Your Geek On With These Five Sci-Fi Faces.

Don't see what you're looking for?. There was a problem completing your request. Please try your search again later.. An unlocked phone is a device that is not bound to any carrier or plan. It allows you to choose your phone first and your carrier second. Upon selecting a plan, simply insert the carrier's SIM card into the phone and you're ready to go. If you decide you want to change carriers down the road or want to take an international trip, it's as simple as replacing your existing SIM card with a new SIM and activating your new plan.. What are the benefits of an unlocked phone?. Freedom: Choose the carrier with the best service or price. If you find a better deal later, you have the ability to change to a different carrier.. Travel: Take your phone internationally and use the carrier of your choice. It's as easy as inserting an active SIM card.. Selection: Choose the phone with the features you want, whether or not your carrier sells it, and get more service options without a contract.. How do I set up my unlocked phone?. The first thing you’ll need is a SIM card for your desired carrier. When activated, the SIM card will let your phone connect to your carrier’s network. If you decide to upgrade to a newer unlocked phone in the future, you can easily remove the SIM card from your old phone and put it in your new phone—just make sure you get the right size of SIM card (nano, micro, or standard) for your phone. If you want to use your phone while traveling internationally, you can easily buy a SIM card for a carrier that operates where you’re traveling. As long as it’s activated, you can just swap SIM cards when you arrive at your destination.. 2.8 x 5.7 x 0.3 in. 0.3 x 5.7 x 2.8 in. 0.3 x 5.7 x 2.8 in. 0.3 x 6.1 x 3 in. 0.3 x 5.7 x 2.8 in. 0.3 x 6.1 x 3 in.
