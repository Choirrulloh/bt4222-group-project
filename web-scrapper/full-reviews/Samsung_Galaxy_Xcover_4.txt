more ... more .... more ... more .... 3 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Kaloyan C.. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 2 Software, Functionality and Camera. 3 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction The rugged smartphone is, by all accounts, a form factor of interest to a tiny consumer niche, and as such isn’t a popular choice with manufacturers. Among the big players, Samsung has been the most supportive of the idea, with the best-known example being the “Active” spins on its mainline flagships. But one might consider its Xcover line, in this case represented by the latest Xcover 4 , to be in an even tighter niche: where the Active series offers top-of-the-line specs if a sturdier body, the Xcover family is firmly and unashamedly planted into the low end. Thus, when taking into consideration whether such a phone is “good”, one has to shift their expectations and judge it more based on whether it meets its own, offbeat set of goals, over whether it suits the everyday consumer’s needs. So with that in mind, let’s take a closer look at this quirky beast. Design and display Durability entails some sacrifices in the looks department You couldn’t call the Xcover 4 pretty if your life depended on it – every design decision on this phone simply screams “function over form”. Visually, this is a classic Samsung but with a couple of necessary changes due to its form factor, such as the all-plastic back and the three physical buttons on the front. This, however, quickly proves itself to be a quite nice little package: the grippy outer shell feels amazingly comfortable in the hand while also doing its job quite well. And somewhat surprisingly, the Xcover 4 carries a US military MIL-STD-810G rating (as well as the more standard IP68), which means it’s resistant to extreme environmental conditions: these include water, dust, shocks, low and high pressure, and extreme temperatures. The display is nothing to write home about with its 720 x 1280 px resolution spread across a 5-inch screen , but is, on the other hand, more than bright enough for outdoor use. However, the auto brightness rarely works particularly well in certain conditions, so you might be better off disabling it if it doesn't feel particularly good for you too.. 5.76 x 2.89 x 0.38 inches. 146.2 x 73.3 x 9.7 mm. 5.33 x 2.61 x 0.31 inches. 135.4 x 66.2 x 7.9 mm. 5.68 x 2.87 x 0.37 inches. 5.77 x 2.83 x 0.28 inches. 146.5 x 72 x 7.2 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 Compare.

In IP68, a higher level of water protection is expected, but exact numbers aren't specified: both depth and continuance are specified by the manufacturer on per device basis.. Display Physical size: 5.0 inches. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, CMOS image sensor. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Night mode, Scenes, Effects.

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 17.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

Availability Officially announced: 01 Mar 2017. Shopping information MSRP price: € 249. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Samsung announces the Galaxy Xcover 4 for Xtreme adventurers. The rugged Samsung smartphone will launch in April.. March 1, 2017 2:02 PM PST. Guaranteed by US Military Standard MIL-STD 810G to withstand drops, high or low temperatures, mechanical shocks, intense sunlight and salt water mist. 5-megapixel front camera and 13-megapixel rear camera. 720x1,280 display resolution (294 ppi) 2 GB of RAM 16 GB internal storage with up to 256 GB via MicroSD. Samsung is officially launching the Galaxy Xcover 4, a rugged smartphone meant for rugged outdoor use. The phone will release in April for €259 (approximately $273, £222, AU$356), according to Samsung's newsroom (German) .. While Samsung is making its fans wait for the hyped-up Galaxy S8 , the Korean company has been announcing other non-flagship phones this year such as the 2017 Galaxy A series. The Galaxy A devices are mid-range smartphones, geared towards people who don't want to buy a premium phone. Samsung's Galaxy Xcover devices fill a different niche and are made for people who want a smartphone that can withstand drops, water, dust, and extreme temperatures. The Xcover 4 isn't a phone for everyone, but it does provide an option for those who want to buy a Samsung phone but don't need all the bells and whistles that come with Samsung's premium Galaxy S devices.. The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 includes the following specs:. In addition to withstanding cold temperatures, the Xcover 4's touchscreen can be used with gloves. The phone also has mechanical buttons at the bottom of the display for navigation.. So far the only announced color option is black. No official word yet on the exact release date and availability..

Samsung Galaxy XCover 4 (SM-G390F) Smartphone Review. Florian Wimmer ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 06/19/2017. Touchscreen Smartphone Android ARM. Robust and stylish? Samsung aims to provide a smartphone that survives in rough environments, but also radiates elegance at the same time. The handset is, in fact, robust and not too bulky. We checked whether its everyday suitability is just as impressive.. Â» Multimedia , Â» Gaming , Â» Lightweight Gaming Â» Budget Office , Â» Business , Â» Workstations Â» Subnotebooks , Â» Ultrabooks , Â» Convertibles. Top 10 under 300 Euros , Â». Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here .. Special protection is needed when a smartphone is often used in unfriendly surroundings, such as on dusty construction sites or in places with high humidity. The smartphone also has to withstand shocks since it could be dropped during work. Thus, an iPhone with its sensitive glass front will not really come into the question; rather, a so-called ruggedized device will be preferred. These smartphones are protected against shocks and environmental influences. Samsung's Galaxy XCover 4 is such a device. It is dust proof and can survive half an hour under water. Samsung prefers not to make any detailed statements about drop resistance, but a solid plastic casing is supposed to protect it against shocks.. There are not many ruggedized smartphones on the market. Some providers, such as CAT or Panasonic, have specialized in this category, but also demand a high price for their devices. The Galaxy XCover 4 is relatively cheap at an RRP of 249 Euros (~$260) and it is decent. However, there are devices that are considerably more bulky such as. The XCover 4 naturally has to compete against its predecessor and other comparison devices such as Lenovo's. to see whether the XCover 4 can keep up with conventional smartphones of the price range..

While the Galaxy XCover 3 was a 4.5-inch handset, the successor is an up-to-date 5-inch smartphone. Thus, it is not surprising that it is wider and longer. However, its casing is now slightly slimmer: 9.7 millimeters (~0.38 in) is pocket-friendly.. is much bulkier with a thickness of 16 millimeters (~0.63 in). The XCover 4 is not an extremely light smartphone, but with a weight of 172 grams (~6.1 oz), it is still comfortable to hold.. The casing is available only in unsusceptible black. Its rubber-coated surface and strong texture should make it particularly slip proof, which is actually true. Thanks to its curved corners, the smartphone is very pleasant to hold. The Galaxy XCover 4 looks neither bulky nor does it flaunt its protective qualities. At a first glance, the smartphone's robust nature is not obvious. The slightly protruding casing bezel protects the screen and the hardware buttons a little. However, we would not advise dropping the device from greater heights as our experiences with the Galaxy XCover 3 has shown.. Strong pressure on the front becomes visible in the liquid crystals, but pressure on the back is not passed on to the screen. The device can hardly be warped and it does not produce any noises then.. Samsung's robust smartphone has an IP68 certificate, i.e. it has a slightly higher protection level than the Galaxy XCover 3. It can also be used for 30 minutes at up to a depth of 1.5 meters (~5 ft) under fresh water without taking damage. It was fully functional in our underwater tests but only the hardware buttons could be used; the touchscreen did not work. The handset first has to dry before the touchscreen functions again. Unlike the predecessor, the audio jack did not cause any problems after bathing.. The device is also MIL-STD-810G certified, which means that in theory it should easily withstand salty air, high or low temperatures or low pressure. Wikipedia , the test conditions for consumer devices are not controlled since it is a military standard. Samsung can thus specify its own test criteria â this should be kept in mind. According to the manufacturer, the smartphone had to pass the following tests to achieve the MIL-STD 810G certification: Altitude (during use and idle), high temperature storage (permanent and cyclic), humidity, freeze, immersion, permanent low temperature storage, rain, salt fog, deposited dust, solar radiation (thermal impact), acceleration, arbitrary vibration, use in high temperatures (permanent and cyclic), streaming rain, blowing dust.. As with the predecessor, flaps for protecting the smartphone's USB port or audio jack are not included. The back is removable and even the battery can be removed..

With 2 GB of working memory and 16 GB of storage for data, the Galaxy XCover 4 is not really generously equipped. Although it has been upgraded in both aspects compared with its predecessor, all comparison devices have at least 32 GB of storage and at least 3 GB of working memory. The storage of the XCover 4 can be expanded via a microSD card. The microSD can be formatted as internal storage. It can only be used for storing data when used as external storage; apps cannot be moved to it. The handset supports NFC and USB OTG. The sensor configuration of the XCover 4 includes an ambient light sensor, position sensor, accelerometer, and proximity sensor. This is satisfactory and acceptable for the price range.. The Android 7.0 operating system with security patches from 1st March 2017 is preloaded. That means that the patches were already three months old at the time of testing. Samsung uses its own user interface that stands out with modified settings and new effects. Samsung Knox â Samsung's own encryption engine that, for example, provides a safe file for personal data â is also installed. Otherwise, Samsung preloads Microsoft's apps that are currently installed on many new smartphones. These are the components of the mobile office suite, OneDrive, and Skype. Furthermore, Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, as well as the health and fitness app SHealth, and Samsung's own email client are installed. Annoying: The Microsoft apps can only be deactivated but not completely uninstalled.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The smartphone supports LTE Cat.4 at speeds of up to 150 Mbit per second (download) and up to 50 Mbit per second (upload). Four GSM and UMTS frequencies and eight LTE bands are available. Thus, a network should be found in many countries. The micro-SIM is quite easy to insert, but the battery has to be removed for this. The Galaxy XCover 4 supports only one SIM card. The reception in the moderately developed German E-network is good in urban areas. At least 3/4 of the signal strength was displayed indoors, and LTE reception was also often indicated.. In terms of Wi-Fi, the smartphone supports the 802.11 a/b/g/n standards and can thus also communicate with the 5 GHz network. At least theoretically, since the 5 GHz network of our router was not identified in practice. We thus performed the test in the 2.4 GHz network. The reception and transmission rates are acceptable.. with a fast 802.11 ac Wi-Fi takes a clear lead. The full signal was displayed in the router's vicinity. Â¾ of the signal strength was available at a distance of 10 meters (~33 ft) and through three walls but websites opened slightly slower..

Our position was roughly located even indoors, but the accuracy of 40 to 60 meters (~131 to ~197 ft) was not very high. The inaccuracy quickly dropped to up to 4 meters (~13 ft) outdoors. Samsung has apparently put a high value on the GPS module in its outdoor smartphone. Our bike ride with the review sample and Garmin's Edge 500 professional navigation system proves this. The logged route deviates by just 30 meters (~100 ft) over 12 kilometers (~705 mi) â great. The Galaxy XCover 4 is not less accurate than Garmin's Edge 500 in the crossing scenario or when crossing the bridge. The XCover 4 only rarely draws a straight line between two points, but they are never too far apart. Thus, the XCover 4 can be trusted on hikes or when used for navigating by car..

Samsung has developed the phone app that can be directly accessed from the lock screen. It strongly resembles Google's stock app: Recent calls are displayed when opened, but all contacts can be accessed via a tab or search for a contact via voice input or keyboard. The keypad has a dedicated button that is always displayed. Unfortunately, the call quality is mediocre: The earpiece is comparatively quiet and could be a problem in loud environments. The installed microphone tends to hum and also reproduces our voices slightly muffled. The speaker is not particularly loud and tends to omit some sound, which can lead to misunderstandings.. Furthermore, loud sounds cause the microphone to overdrive in hands-free mode.. Samsung should have put more effort into this after we criticized the call quality of the predecessor.. In terms of cameras, the Galaxy XCover 4 is considerably more up-to-date than its predecessor. A 13-megapixel camera on the back and a 5-megapixel camera on the front provide the common resolution levels of the lower mid-range. The primary camera has a standard contrast autofocus and a single-colored LED flash. Its photos are quite sharp and the color reproduction is natural, although they do not look particularly warm. The image quality is good, even in details, but the dynamic in dark areas could be higher. The camera hardly identifies anything in low-light conditions, making party photos without the flash difficult. Videos can be recorded in the Full HD resolution. Exposure and sharpness can be adjusted manually, but the camera does that automatically otherwise. The focus is usually correct, but the exposure is often too dark, especially with light from the back. The image sharpness is overall good. The front camera has a resolution of 5 megapixels. At a first glance, the exposure of the photos seems to be good, but they lack some dynamic in both the bright and dark areas. Areas are reproduced with little details and thus the flower petals on the test photos almost look like a painting. Minor contour doubling can be seen on edges. It is also possible to record Full HD videos with the front camera. The image quality is quite good here. Exposure adapts quickly, but this camera also has problems with light from the back.. Overall, the photos are acceptable for an affordable mid-range handset. The rear-facing camera even shoots quite good photos in normal light conditions. quite suitable for undemanding selfies, but it should not be used for sophisticated photography.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. The primary camera has to prove itself again in our lab under defined light conditions. Our test photo displays minor sharpness problems when reproducing text on colored backgrounds. At least the edges are displayed with almost no artifacts or contour doubling. The sharpness stays high toward the edges. The color reproduction tends to be a bit too pale. This is true for both bright and dark color shades.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. Samsung does not include many accessories: Only a charger, a USB cable, a quick start guide, and warranty conditions are found in the box. Samsung does not offer any special accessories for the XCover 4 on its website either.. Samsung includes a 24-month warranty on its smartphone. This also applies to the IP certification, i.e. water and dust sealing as long as the smartphone is used in accordance with Samsung's specifications of use. The battery is covered for 12 months, and the charger and USB cable both for 6 months.. Samsung only preloads its own keyboard app on the smartphone. Thus, users who want another keyboard will have to download it from Google's Play Store. Samsung's keyboard offers relatively narrow keys that are tall in portrait mode and have a dedicated number row. Swipe inputting has to be enabled, but it is also present. Generally, there are many settings and it is possible to type quickly on Samsung's keyboard.. Samsung's XCover 4 uses quite a few hardware buttons. The Android menu buttons are situated below the screen. They have a clear pressure point and make a robust impression. The standby button is on the casing's right, and the volume control and a dedicated XCover button are found on the left. Short pressure enables the flashlight, and longer pressure launches the camera. All buttons are easy to feel and have a clear pressure point.. As usual with Samsung, there are many aids for disabled users and diverse control options, such as turn to mute, emergency messages or display several apps simultaneously via a multi-window display.. A glove mode is also integrated again, and thus the touchscreen can be used when wearing thin gloves.. The resolution of 1280x720 pixels is on the standard level for the price range. has a four times higher resolution, and. Despite the large screen size, the PPI has also increased considerably compared with the predecessor due to the higher resolution: The XCover 4's screen offers 294 pixels per inch. The review sample is one of the few devices by Samsung that does not have an AMOLED screen but an IPS panel.. The screen has an average brightness of 436.8 cd/mÂ², which is on par with the screen in the XCover3 but much higher than the screens in the. An illumination of 88% is the lowest rate in the comparison field, but that is still enough to let large colored areas look relatively homogeneous.. 430 cd/m² 452 cd/m² 462 cd/m² 421 cd/m² 445 cd/m² 453 cd/m² 407 cd/m² 416 cd/m² 445 cd/m². 88 % Center on Battery: 445. cd/m²) ΔE Color 6.5 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 7.2 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.53.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 20400 Hz 90. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 20400. Hz (Likely utilizing PWM) Flickering detected at a brightness setting of 90. There should be no flickering or PWM above this brightness setting.. Hz is quite high, so most users sensitive to PWM should not notice any flickering.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8995 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.. The high black value of 0.64 cd/mÂ² is somewhat a problem: dark areas often look milky gray and the contrast drops to 664:1, which leads to less brilliant colors on the screen. with an AMOLED screen and thus theoretically infinite contrast, and. with a much lower black value are better here. The device also uses pulse width modulation for brightness control at a brightness of just 90%, which is a high-frequency flickering that lets the image look darker. Since this frequency is very high, it should not be a problem even for sensitive users.. We also discovered a visible bluish tint in the image reproduction analysis with the spectrophotometer and CalMAN software. Apart from a blue filter, there are no options to adjust the white balance. The color reproduction is generally too cool due to the bluish tint. Blue colors also deviate most from the specifications of the sRGB reference color space..

This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.2 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The good brightness pays off outdoors. Although the screen is highly reflective, it is usually possible to recognize something on the screen even in very bright surroundings. The ambient light sensor is sometimes a bit slow, but it then adapts the brightness quickly and appropriately.. The viewing angles of the IPS screen do not give much cause for complaint. Minor brightness shifts are visible from very flat angles at most. The Exynos 7570 SoC in the XCover 4 can boast with four cores and 1.4 GHz of power. It allows for performance rates on the lower mid-range level and presents a strong performance gain compared with the predecessor. However, it is noticeably inferior to high-quality mid-range devices, such as. Its performance is also on the level of the lower mid-range. offers a much weaker graphics performance..

We can only conditionally recommend the Galaxy XCover 4 to players looking for a robust smartphone. The graphics unit is too weak to render sophisticated graphics, even for the not particularly high-resolution screen. â Asphalt 8 â does not run smoothly in high details. Somewhat less demanding 3D games, such as â Dead Trigger 2 â, can run smoothly. That is also true for 2D games like â Angry Birds â. Since the graphics unit does not support all modern APIs, some effects might not be displayed and its future compatibility in terms of games is also questionable.. Control via position sensor and touchscreen is smooth.. The casing temperatures of Samsung's Galaxy XCover 4 are already noticeably increased in idle mode. We measured a maximum of 33.7 Â°C (~93 Â°F). The temperatures climbed up to 38.2 Â°C (~101 Â°F) during full load. This maximum temperature is reached in the earpiece area of all places. Thus, making calls can be a sweaty issue after prolonged load. The measured temperatures are not critical overall, but lower temperatures would have been desirable, especially in idle mode, particularly in view of the smartphone's relatively low performance.. At least the SoC does not throttle its performance even after prolonged load as we discovered using the battery benchmarks of GFXBench.. 36.4 °C 36.6 °C 34.8 °C. 38.2 °C 36.6 °C 35.7 °C. 37.9 °C 37 °C 36.2 °C.

Unlike the rear-sided speaker of the Galaxy XCover 3, Samsung has incorporated the speaker into the upper right of the Galaxy XCover 4. This is an unusual place that we found quite favorable in practice. It is difficult to cover the speaker there. The sound is not overly loud and fairly clear. Low tones are hardly audible; the sound is relatively treble-heavy. The sound tends to become inaccurate in louder parts and the instruments are reduced to a pulp. Overall, it is quite possible to watch an occasional YouTube video or sample a piece of music, but it is not really fun. Playback via the 3.5-mm jack or Bluetooth is much better; we did not have problems with the connection.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 31.6 34.1 25 25.4 33.4 31 25.3 32.3 40 32.9 27.6 50 33.6 28.1 63 31.6 34.4 80 28.4 30.1 100 27 36.5 125 20.8 33.4 160 22 41.2 200 21.3 47.6 250 20.8 52.1 315 21.2 55.2 400 19.4 57.4 500 19.5 60.3 630 17.7 65.4 800 17.9 68.6 1000 17.8 70 1250 17.3 70.6 1600 17.4 72 2000 16.7 71.3 2500 17.2 69.7 3150 18.2 71 4000 17.9 72.4 5000 17.6 66.3 6300 17.7 61.4 8000 17.8 57.9 10000 17.9 58 12500 18.1 49.2 16000 18.2 46.6 SPL 30 80.4 N 1.3 47.4 median 17.9 Samsung Galaxy XCover 4 median 60.3 Delta 1.3 10.7 31.6 41.7 25.4 40.1 25.3 36.6 32.9 27.5 33.6 29.7 31.6 33.2 28.4 29.4 27 27.4 20.8 25.1 22 23 21.3 27 20.8 39.2 21.2 47.8 19.4 54.3 19.5 62.5 17.7 72.2 17.9 75.3 17.8 76.7 17.3 74.9 17.4 72.9 16.7 74.9 17.2 75.8 18.2 76.6 17.9 76 17.6 72.3 17.7 61.2 17.8 56.2 17.9 57 18.1 63.7 18.2 52.7 30 85.8 1.3 59.8 median 17.9 AGM A8 median 62.5 1.3 16.9 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Frequency diagram comparison (checkboxes above can be turned on/off!). The Galaxy XCover 4's power consumption in a turned off state and in standby are very low, which is a good start in this chapter. The idle consumption is also on a normal level, but the predecessor was more efficient overall. The XCover 4 is also situated in the midfield of the comparison devices with a maximum load consumption of 5.92 watts. It is not a power waster, but it is not a power saver either..

In review: Samsung Galaxy XCover 4. Even if Samsung's Galaxy XCover 4 is not quite as resistant as it appears, it is protected better than many other very sensitive smartphones. The robust plastic casing does not look bulky and even the battery can be replaced. Water and dust protection have been increased compared with the predecessor, and the speaker now functions impeccably when the handset is wet. After using it in water, we found a drop of water under the rear cover. Thus, the device should be dried separately here.. The device's storage configuration could be more generous, but its extensive operating system and quite useful primary camera are convincing. The input options are diverse, the screen is appropriate, and the performance sufficient for daily routine. The battery life also fits well to the good overall impression. We did not like the handset's sound quality and gaming performance as much, though.. Like its predecessor, the Galaxy XCover 4 is not suitable for extreme situations, but quite well-equipped for the uncertainties of everyday. The hard shell conceals a solid, lower mid-range smartphone.. Users who need an ultimately high-end ruggedized smartphone for extreme situations will have to look around at the experts. Samsung offers a solid device for slightly more demanding routine use, for hiking, or the occasional visit to a dusty construction site. Since the device is relatively cheap and can serve with very good GPS, it is quite suitable for these situations.. Samsung Galaxy XCover 4 - 2017-06-12 06/12/2017 v6 Florian Wimmer.

The bonus is for the price point, it has impressive features one would not expect for a rugged model phone. Though it only has 16 GB internal storage it can take an impressive 256 Gb microSD card. Also even though the screen resolution is 1280x720 the camera can take 1080p photos and videos a definite bonus for this price point. So stop bashing or putting it down for what it doesn't have. Because it's not suppose to be in the same class as a Galaxy S series.. Can this phone use fast charser. Can i but a J5 2016 battery in.. Are there any rumors on Xcover 5?. HRCorpsegrinder, 27 Nov 2017 Phone is supposed to be shock resistant (MIL-STD-810). After about 5 months of use, phone rand... more Well, I can assure you that it is waterproof, as mine took a bath twice and survived it. Regarding the turning off, if it is new, I'd turn it in to the store where you have bought it from, because this just can't be normal. I have this phone for only a month so I wouldn't like to make any false statements, but it did not let me down until now and it seems like it will not do it in the near future either. I really like it, especially because the battery life is just awesome.. Phone is supposed to be shock resistant (MIL-STD-810). After about 5 months of use, phone randomly turns off whilst being carried in pocket. Isolated and controlled home experiment shows that a even a very mild kick causes phone to turn off. It's not battery contact, I tried to additionally reinforce battery, phone turns-off even with firmly fixed battery. Very light and thin back cover and "naked" connectors (USB, headphone jack) do not make me very confident that it's water resistant. Not willing to test it, though.. Anonymous, 01 Nov 2017 Does anyone know how to turn off autocorrect. It is coming up with bizarre results. Go to Settings > General management > Language and input > Virtual keyboard > Your standard keyboard (in my case, the Samsung keyboard) > turn off "Predictive text" and/or "Auto check spelling". There are some other useful options that you may consider useful, so take a look at them, too.. Is there any fix for the focus on the camera?. If I touch the point that I want to be focused, it starts to focus, but once it gets to the best possible focal length, it just kind of goes back to the blurry unfocused image. That mostly happens when I try to focus on a near object, but it sometimes happens when focusing on things that are further away. If you don't know the solution, is there any app that actually enables manual focus (with a slider or similar). It may even be a paid app, as it really isn't a problem to spend 5-10 bucks on a quality app. BTW, I am not experiencing any of the touch issues mentioned below.. Does anyone know how to turn off autocorrect. It is coming up with bizarre results.. I had the same problem with the same symptoms.. Touch sensitivity issues with the hold touch problem and the multi touch 3 finger not working. The problem is that after a factory reset the holding touch and 3 finger problem disappear temporarily while the sensitivity problem exists always even on recovery mode. I had to send the device 2 times for Samsung to diagnose and replace lcd and digitizer because they could not find any problems with the tests they make. All I had to say was that the device was not working with gloves or pen even with gloves mode on normally like another x cover 4 witch I accidentally found to be working ok. Also sent them the video of the problem with pen. This device is advertised to be fully working with gloves. Andrew04, 21 Sep 2017 I have a touch screen sensitivity problem with the xcover 4 and my network, Vodafone, are unab... more Go to the repair facility and show that it doesn't keep the touch for longer than period of time. Find a random game that requires you to hold the touch. Also you can make a video with another phone/camera and show that it struggles to detect finger correctly.. Pages: 1 2 3 4 5 6 ».

WHY CHOOSE US. Able to survive immersion in water for up to 30 minutes and drops onto concrete from a height of 1.8 metres, the Xcover 4 is a semi-rugged handset that will survive the knocks of daily life a little better than regular Smartphones.. When you order a Samsung Galaxy Xcover4 from Clove Technology, you will receive an official UK or EU specification SIM Free handset.. All of our phones are factory unlocked and ready for use with UK, EU & most global SIM cards.. The phones have support for global GSM & 3G networks; for 4G / LTE support outside of the EU, please check the specifications.. Where a product option states "EU Model", it will have been sourced directly from a European supplier. These phones should come factory sealed with the original Samsung Adaptive Fast Charger (Europlug 2-pin).. Where a product states "EU Convert", it will have been sourced from a UK supplier that has imported EU stock and converted it for UK sale. These phones will be resealed with official Samsung branding and should contain a standard UK charger (3-pin). Please note this may not be the official Samsung Adaptive Fast Charger.. The Xcover 4 is available in Black with 16GB of internal storage and 2GB of RAM.. For some life in the outdoors is an everyday occurrence. Whether your job or passion has you out in all weathers and environments, the Xcover 4 has been designed with those in harsher environments in mind.. Whether you are a farmer, lumberjack, site warden or builder, the Xcover 4 will withstand conditions which would be beyond most regular phones.. Water, dust, dirt and drops onto concrete are not sympathetic for most technology products.. The Xcover 4 continues on from the Xcover 3 and offers a cost-effective smartphone that has been engineered to offer more resistance to the elements yet remain practical and as desirable as possible.. Gripping the phone securely has been improved, thanks to a redesigned casing and back plate with a tactile surface.. The touch screen sensitivity has also been improved since the last generation. You can now interact with the screen even when wearing gloves.. An additional key has also been placed on the side of the phone - you can program this to launch specific apps or other features to suit your use.. NFC has been included in the new Xcover 4. This allows for contactless payments through Android Pay and seamless pairing with compatible accessories.. Samsung has also seen fit to extend their Knox security apps and protocols to the Xcover 4. With Knox installed, the Xcover 4 is business-ready and able to be quickly folded into existing MDM solutions.. You will be able to use the Xcover in fresh water at depths of 1.5 metre for up to 30 minutes.. If you live or work around water such protection can be a real delight when you hear the splash of the phone hitting the water.. This IP rating also ensures protection against other damaging substances like dust and sand.. Thus, whether you are at the top of a snowy peak, or in the middle of the desert, the Xcover 4 will power through.. Find out more about IP ratings here .. It may be stereotypical but the evidence is there to confirm that many who work in the trades are more likely to be replacing their phone due to the environment in which they work.. If this includes you, the Galaxy Xcover 4 boasts MIL Spec 810G rating which ensures the device will survive multiple drops from heights of approx 1.2 metres onto solid concrete.. Ideal for groundworkers, scaffolders or anyone working at height.. Aside from iOS on an Apple device, the big mobile platform of choice is Google’s Android.. It is the latter that is installed on the Xcover 4 and gives you the facility to be online, functional and connected to the wider world within a matter of minutes.. With apps for navigation, email, document editing, the Xcover can do more than just make phone calls or be a device to access the internet.. Download specific apps from the Play Store to make it more personal to you. Customise the OS to make the interface work the way you want it.. A quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM keep the Xcover 4 ticking along nicely with all the tasks you ask of it.. 16GB of internal memory provides some space for apps and media, but this can be further expanded via a microSD card up to 256GB.. A front 5-megapixel camera is present as is a rear facing 13-megapixel lens for those who need and want to take pictures on the go. With WiFi and 4G connectivity, it is easy to share images or make live video calls from wherever you are.. If you need a phone that can survive more than most, the Xcover 4 is the fourth generation of Xcover smartphone that deals with water and dust.. *Since September 2013, Samsung has implemented a 'region lock' on all new stock. Clove Technology only has access to models designed for the “European” region, which covers both UK and mainland Europe. The compatible countries are listed below**.. For correct operation, this handset should be activated inside one of these countries with a SIM card issued for use there. The device will then be able to accept SIM cards from outside of these countries.. Activation requires turning the device on for the first time & completing set-up with the SIM installed, then completing at least 5 minutes of voice call(s) with this SIM.. Without activation, you may still use the device outside of these countries when 'roaming' - using a SIM card from the listed countries.. If this activation procedure is not followed then the device will lock when first attempted to be used with a SIM card from outside of these regions. Local Samsung support may provide a code to unlock such handsets.. **All member states of the E.E.A and the following additional territories: Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.O.M), Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, Serbia and Vatican City.. IF YOUR CHOSEN DELIVERY COUNTY IS NOT LISTED, CLOVE TECHNOLOGY WILL BREAK THE SEAL ON THIS DEVICE AND ACTIVATE IT. YOU MUST AGREE TO THIS PROCEDURE IN THE CHECKOUT BEFORE THE SALE WILL COMPLETE..

You can read our Samsung Galaxy S8 Active review here .. The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 holds two certifications for ruggedness. The first is the more common IP68 certification, while the second is the rarer Military MIL-STD 840G certification.. Fill in the form and be the first to know when the Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 is released .. If desired or needed, the phone can be immersed to 1.5 metres for up to half an hour, making it ideal for active people, sports people and outdoor workers. The design brings with it a non slip finish, giving a more reassuring grip, even when your hands are wet.. New: Nokia 8 review. The Galaxy Xcover 4 is 9.7mm thick, which is thinner than the Galaxy Xcover 3. Weighing 172g, this Samsung phone is also lighter than the Samsung Galaxy S8 Active, showing that it doesn’t all go the Active’s way on the spec sheet.. The 5” display has a HD resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. A Blue Light Filter can be used to reduce eye strain in the evening and you can manually set a time for this to be activated or have it auto activated based on the time of sunset, for your specific location. The touchscreen can also be used while wearing gloves.. A steady performance is driven by a 1.4GHz quad-core processor with 2GB RAM, which for all but the most demanding, will bring a satisfactory experience with minimal lag times.. Samsung Knox gives business grade security and includes real time malware protection. There is no fingerprint sensor or iris scanner, like that on the Galaxy S8 Active, so you can choose PIN, pattern or a password.. Samsung has give the Galaxy Xcover 4 a Secure Folder for keeping photos, documents, notes and even apps private. It is probably wise to set the Secure Folder to auto-lock, if you intend to use it.. The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 has a 16GB memory, of which 10.1GB is free to the user. You can boost the memory through the microSD card slot that accepts cards with a value of up to 256GB.. You can transfer content from an old phone onto this using Wi-Fi Direct or the Samsung Cloud, or through a number of other different methods.. The Xcover Active Key gives quick access to preferred apps and can be customise to switch on the torch or open the camera app, for example.. The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 runs Google’s Android Nougat operating system, which brings with it apps such as Chrome, Gmail, YouTube and Maps. Nougat also introduces users to Multi Window Split Screen View for using apps side-by-side, in size adjustable windows.. Samsung has pre-loaded Samsung Notes and S Health and you can download more Galaxy apps from the Samsung Galaxy Apps Store. You can also still visit Google’s Play Store to download apps from third parties.. The 13MP camera has a LED flash and a double click of the home button will launch the camera quickly. Shooting modes includes Auto Mode, Pro Mode, Continuous Shot, Panorama, Night, Sports, HDR and Sound & Shot.. You can also record video at a quality of Full HD.. The 5MP selfie camera uses a screen flash when needed. You can make beautification adjusts before taking a selfie, including adjusting your skin tone, enlarging eyes or slimming the face. You can then preview these changes before activating the shutter.. A Wide Selfie Mode is available on the Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 and this works like Panorama. So rather than having a wide angle lens, you pan the camera from side to side to take a group selfie or selfie with scenery.. The 2,800mAh battery provides good usage times. You can expect to get up to 14 hours of internet use or up to 13 hours of video playback, 77 hours of audio playback or up to 17 hours of talk time.. If needed, you can switch the phone into Maximum Power Saving Mode, for days of standby.. Next: Lenovo K8 Note review. 250 MB data. Free Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 black. 500 MB data.

Samsung Galaxy XCover 4 in a nutshell: Specs and UK release info.. Samsung Galaxy XCover 4 best features. Samsung Galaxy XCover 4 UK release info. Samsung Galaxy XCover 4 specs, best features and UK release info: All you need to know about Samsung’s new XCover 4 mobile phone, a rugged but stylish Android smartphone boasting full water resistance, a 13-megapixel camera and a 5-inch HD screen. Here’s the full XCover 4 specs, plus what we know about the UK price and release date.. We saw loads of fantastic smartphones launched at MWC 2017 , as you’ll know if you read our guide to the best phones and tablets of MWC. However, while Samsung made us go ‘oooh’ with its professional Galaxy Tab S3 tablet and new Windows 10 devices , there was no sign of the well-anticipated Galaxy S8 flagship phone in Barcelona.. Then, at the very end of the mobile show, Samsung did launch a handset. Not the S8 as hoped, but the new Samsung Galaxy XCover 4. This rugged cut-price mobile is made with outdoors adventurers in mind, similar to the old Galaxy Active mobiles.. Here’s the full Galaxy XCover 4 specs, a run-down of the features and the UK release info we know so far.. Not only is the Galaxy XCover 4. durable enough to survive bumps, knocks and drops, but that frame is also fully water resistant. Full MIL-STD 810G military standard grading means it can withstand extreme temperatures too.. Great news if you’re off venturing into the wild and you need something that won’t break apart with a little bit of abuse.. There’s also a glove mode, for when things get a bit chilly.. The 5-inch screen is rather basic, with older TFT technology instead of Samsung’s tried-and-trusted Super AMOLED panels. HD display, so you should get reasonably sharp visuals, but this is more of a functional mobile screen than something to relish movies on.. Performance also should be fine for everyday use, but not geared towards blasting through the latest games and so on. Android Nougat is the OS of choice on the XCover 4, giving you the latest Google OS features such as split-screen multi-tasking.. The XCover 4’s 16GB of storage space can thankfully be quickly and easily expanded via a microSD memory card, up to 256GB in all.. A 2800mAh battery will hopefully give you at least a day of life between charges. Handy when you’re out and about. 13-megapixel camera should capture detailed photos of wherever you roam (as should the 5-megapixel selfie snapper).. The Samsung Galaxy XCover 4 is hitting Europe in early April, although right now Samsung hasn’t clarified if the phone will be released here in the UK. If it is, you can expect an asking price of around £199 to £249, as in Europe it costs 259 Euros.. Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7: Is the S8 a better buy than the iPhone?.

Sturdy-feeling Long lasting battery IP68 dust and water repellent. Not meeting rugged expectations Placement of the torch app button Display quality. The little processor that could Takes ‘Pro’ shots Poor speaker placement Not as sturdy as we thought. The Galaxy XCover 4 is Samsung’s fourth smartphone to hit the Canadian market this year and is by far the most durable.. The device’s unique rugged quality lies in its. MIL-STD 810G certified-military grade casing, allowing the device to survive drops that other smartphones couldn’t endure.. Per this military grade certification, devices are required to withstand 26 drops from four feet onto 1-inch of plywood, on top of concrete, before it qualifies as military certified. Smartphones with the MIL-STD 810G certification are also resistant towards cold and heat.. We felt that dropping a device onto 1-inch of plywood didn’t quite do enough to showcase a rugged lifestyle, however, so we put the XCover 4 to the test MobileSyrup -style to see if it can truly live up to the toughest user’s expectations.. But more about that to come.. First, let’s talk about what’s running under the Galaxy XCover 4’s hood. The phone features a quad-core, Exynos 7570 processor clocked at 1.4 GHz and a Mali-T720MP2 graphics processor. Additionally, it includes 2GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage that’s expandable up to 256 GB.. Running on top is Android 7.0 (Nougat) with Samsung’s TouchWiz Grace UX running on top. Though not close to stock Android, Samsung’s TouchWiz is quite different than the skin of yesteryear. It didn’t feel too intrusive and was easy to use.. Though the XCover 4 runs reasonably well for what it is, depending on how many apps you have open, you may notice lag before launching an application. I found this happened quite a bit when trying to open Google Chrome or Facebook when multiple apps were running in the background.. After clearing all the apps running in the background and waiting a moment, the device ran much smoother, though this isn’t something most people will opt to do in everyday usage.. The XCover 4 ran games like Asphalt 8 and Don’t Starve smoothly without any stutter for at least half an hour. The phone would occasionally get warm, but never to a level where it felt extreme.. The phone’s battery is one of its best qualities, as the device stocks a 2,800mAh cell, that can easily last more than a day with medium usage, which in my case means playing games for about 30 minutes, watching Netflix for one or two hours and casually surfing the web for another approximately two hours.. With minimal usage, the XCover 4 is capable of easily lasting three days, no doubt due to its moderately-sized 5-inch display and power-efficient processor. The handset also charges from zero to 100 percent in less than two hours.. The XCover 4 features a 13-megapixel rear facing shooter with a f/1.9 and a 5-megapixel selfie camera featuring a f/2.2. Without changing any of the camera settings the device takes decent photos in outdoor lighting, though low-light, indoors photos come out in poor quality.. The phone’s shooter does include a ‘Pro’ mode that allows its users to change the ISO, white balance and the shutter speed, and I found playing with these settings solved most of the smartphone’s camera issues. Additionally, the camera features a sports, night and HDR mode that helps the device take better pictures without fiddling around with the Pro mode.. Both the rear facing and the selfie shooter are capable of taking photos that are fine for sharing on social media, but those who are really into photography will definitely want more from their smartphone camera.. The XCover 4 features a 5-inch IPS, LCD display, with a 720 x 1280 pixel resolution and a 294 ppi pixel density. With the XCover’s price tag ($325 CAD outright at many carriers) in mind, the smartphone’s display does look decent, with images and video appearing vibrant and clear.. While watching The Mindy Project it was clear the quality wasn’t as good as a smartphone that features a quad HD or full 1080p display, but it depends on the type of content you’re watching. For example, while watching animated show American Dad I could barely tell the difference between the XCover 4 and the Samsung Galaxy S7’s far more high-end screen.. Audio-wise the XCover 4’s speakers aren’t too loud, with acoustics often sounding tinny and hollow, especially when watching YouTube videos with low quality audio and using the phone on speaker.. The XCover 4 features a side speaker and due to it’s speaker placement when accidentally lying the device on the side with the speaker, the audio quality takes a dive.. The XCover 4 measures in with a 146.2mm x 73.3mm x 9.7mm frame and weighs 172g. In my opinion the XCover 4 may feel a little too small, though as a plus, this means it’s compact enough for one-handed usage. It’s military grade frame, however, is the device’s main draw.. The frame gives the phone a smooth and sturdy exterior that feels nearly unbreakable and is also very easy to grip, so even though it can withstand a drop, you’ll probably have difficulty actually dropping the phone in the first place.. The Galaxy XCover 4 has numerous physical buttons, which makes the device stand out as odd in an industry full of smartphone that are moving in the opposite direction.. The device features a physical home, recent app and back button, but unfortunately doesn’t include a fingerprint scanner. Additionally, around the frame the device features a volume rocker, power button, and a torch button that can be double clicked to activate the device’s camera.. I found the flashlight functionality to be annoying; often clicking the button by accident. Moreover, after mistakenly turning on the flashlight and locking the screen, there was no other way to turn off the torch app apart from unlocking the phone and pressing the button again. This probably happened most frequently while I was watching Netflix.. When it comes to durability — the main selling point of the XCover 4 — the device falls just short of getting our recommendation for a construction worker or someone with an extremely rugged lifestyle.. In MobileSyrup’ s test, it withstood nine falls from around four feet on to concrete — a harsher contact surface than plywood and thus a stronger test than the MIL-STD 810G certification — before cracking, and by the time it took 26 falls, the device was completely shattered and the removable back fell off repeatedly.. However performance-wise the device could be a lot worse; it accepted multi tasking, surfing the internet and playing games quite well.Personally I believe the XCover 4 would probably work better for rowdy young teenagers. It's sturdy enough for the average consumer, but not for the people who would actually be interested in purchasing a rugged phone.The device is available at Bell and Rogers for $350 outright, which isn't too expensive for all of the good that comes with the smartphone however its $300 Videotron price tag is a bitter fit.. The XCover 4 is sort of durable. All things considered, the Samsung Galaxy XCover 4 is far from being a perfect phone. Its lacklustre display and camera quality left me wanting more, even in comparison with other mid range devices like the Moto E4 and the LG Stylo 3 Plus..
