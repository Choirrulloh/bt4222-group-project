Alcatel 5 price, specs and availability details leaked. by Team AA 4 weeks ago. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The Alcatel 5 has been leaked again, giving us almost all of the details we were missing we on the upcoming device.. WinFuture [translated], which suggests that the handset will come with a 5.7-inch, IPS LCD display with 18:9 aspect ratio and HD+ 1440 x 720 resolution. phone is expected to include an octa-core, MediaTek MT6750 chipset, 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage space (plus microSD support).. On the back is said to be a single 12 MP camera with f/2.0 aperture, while the front of the handset would be home to a dual 13 MP + 5 MP camera setup (with 1.4 Âµm sensor and 120-degree wide-angle lens). The Alcatel 5 would support the trending Face Unlock feature, too.. Previous rumors regarding the 3,000 mAh battery also appear to have been accurate.. The Alcatel 5 price is likely to be set at 229.99 euros, or around $285, and it will go on sale first in Europe. We donât yet know if/when it will land in other regions, but with the device having already been seen at CES , and such a substantial leak arriving just ahead of MWC , Iâd be surprised if we didnât learn more there.. Previous coverage (01/04): CES 2018 is as good of a time as any for companies to announce their wares so they can kick off 2018 on a high note. We’re not saying that’s when Alcatel plans to unveil its upcoming flagship smartphone, but seeing how we might have a look at the phone’s final design, it would make sense.. The final design comes to us courtesy of famed leaker Evan Blass, who took to Twitter to post the image:. Final design of the upcoming Alcatel 5 flagship. â Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 4, 2018. If this really is the final design, it would line up with previous reports of the Alcatel 5 featuring an 18:9 display. The interesting thing is that the phone mostly does away with the bottom bezel while maintaining the top bezel.. This is not the first time we’ve seen phones with small bezels on three sides, since the Xiaomi Mi Mix and its sequel exist, but those phones generally opted for a large chin. Alcatel looks to take the opposite route and keep the earpiece, camera, and sensors on the top of the phone.. We’re getting our first look at Alcatel’s 2018 lineup of phones. Even though it may not be the most well-known brand in the world, Alcatel makes some pretty good smartphones. The Idol 3 and Idol 4S were very compelling budget options in their time. This is also not the first time we’ve seen the Alcatel 5 in this form, seeing how the phone visited the FCC this past December in a different color scheme. Based on that visit, as well as what we’ve seen of it so far, the phone looks to feature a single rear camera, a USB Type-C port that does double duty as your only way to listen to music with wires, and a 3,000 mAh battery.. We also know that the Alcatel 5 might be accompanied by five other phones that will presumably launch at various price points. This is all speculation until we hear it from the horse’s mouth, but with CES right around the corner, that could happen sooner than later.. Please enter a valid email address.

The Xperia XZ2 is Sony's fastest, strangest flagship phone yet. OnePlus 5T will only play HD Netflix if you send it in for service. Galaxy S9 US pre-orders focus on trade-in deals. Alcatel crams flagship features into its affordable smartphones. 18:9 screens and dual cameras don't have to cost a fortune.. When I first saw its 2018 phone lineup , Alcatel was clear: Its plan for this year was to make premium smartphone features available for much less than typical flagship prices. In this case, Alcatel means giving 18:9 screens, fingerprint sensors, and elaborate camera setups to as many people as possible. Based on some hands-on time here in Barcelona, Alcatel seems to have done a fine job democratizing these features; the real question is how the phones will stand up to the rest of the impressive low-cost devices we expect to see as the show goes on.. Anyway, let's start with the Alcatel 5 -- it's easily the most interesting of the brand's lineup, if only because of its unusual design. The bezels around the sides and bottom of its 5.7-inch display are barely there, but there's lots of space between the top of the phone and the top of the screen. (If anyone remembers Sharp's AQUOS Crystal phones, it's like one of those, upside-down.). That extra space would be completely unsightly had Alcatel not put that room to good use. There's a clever dual-camera system in place that pairs a 13-megapixel primary camera with a 5MP sensor for 120-degree wide-angle selfies. It's probably no surprise that photos taken with either camera were passable at best, but the phone is at least smart enough to automatically switch to the wide-angle mode when it detects more than two faces in the frame.. While the single 12-megapixel camera around back is more traditional, it also produced much better photos. Most sample photos were decently bright and punchy -- a shot I took of a croissant bathed in light made me a little too happy -- but it sometimes struggled with accurate exposures and limited dynamic range. A "social" mode injects a little levity into an otherwise straightforward camera experience: You can use it to quickly assemble 4-photo collages and photo strips. All told, the results are good enough to pepper your Facebook feed, but I wouldn't recommend printing any of them out.. Beyond its oddball design and largely decent cameras, the Alcatel 5 gives off an above-average vibe. Benchmarks were verboten, but the octa-core MediaTek chipset running the show kept up well with my fiddling. Jumping between running apps was quick enough, and the whole experience was a smooth one. Alcatel's relatively light touch with software certainly helped with this. It's definitely not a stock Android 8.0 Oreo experience -- Alcatel loaded this thing up with a lot of extras -- but it comes pretty close. Its 5.7-inch, TCL-made LCD display featured some muted colors but held up surprisingly well against the brilliant Barcelona sun. I do wish the screen ran at a resolution higher than 1440x720, but such trade-offs are inevitable considering the 5's €230 price tag.. Gallery: Hands-on with Alcatel's 5 and 3-series phones | 17 Photos. Still, it's nice to know you can get a phone that packs a fingerprint sensor and a face-unlock method for that kind of cash. If you're really concerned about security, though, you should probably stick to the former. Alcatel's so-called Face Key feature detects 100 points on your face using the front-facing camera to verify your identity, and could theoretically be fooled by a detailed photo. It's convenient and decently fast, but I wouldn't use it as my only unlock method. In any case, the speed at which flagship features become mainstream seems to pick up every year, and with the 5, Alcatel proves it can keep up with the pace of progress.. Don't worry if you don't have that kind of cash handy, either. The next step down from the Alcatel 5 is the Alcatel 3V, which packs many of the same features as its (slightly) more expensive cousin. Face Key is here, as well that handy rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The really weird bit is that, for €190, you'll get a phone that in some ways surpasses the Alcatel 5.. At 6 inches diagonal, the 3V's screen is the biggest the phones in the company's new lineup, and it runs at a higher resolution (2160x1080), to boot. Alcatel also opted to run with a dual camera on the phone's back -- a 12-megapixel sensor does most of the heavy lifting and yielded photos of similar quality to the Alcatel 5's, but a secondary 2-megapixel depth camera adds a nice dash of bokeh to tight shots. And for those who can't deal with the 5's odd look, the Alcatel 3V features a more conventional design, with a glossy, curved back. Some will find this aesthetic pretty generic, but it's still a comforting alternative to the 5's angular body. And while its performance isn't quite as fluid to use as the Alcatel 5, the 3V's quad-core MediaTek chip never felt sluggish. It's a passable performer and handled a few preloaded games without issue.. If you like most of what the 3V offers but would rather save a smidge and get a wide-angle camera, well, there's the €180 Alcatel 3X. Don't even need to shoot wide-angle photos? No worries: How about the €150 Alcatel 3? We could keep this game up until we hit the Alcatel 1X, a perfectly adequate smartphone with an 18:9 5.5-inch display and some surprisingly nice finishes. Normally, I'd say this is midrange overkill, but hey -- there really is something for everyone here (unless you want something truly premium, that is).. The worst part of craving a newly announced phone is having to wait for the release, but Alcatel should be getting these things out the door very quickly. In fact, while the 3 series and 1 series phones will be launched in the coming weeks and months, you can go out and lay claim to an Alcatel 5 right now. The one caveat: Alcatel hasn't discussed plans to release any of these devices in the United States, so domestic phone fans on a budget will have to look elsewhere for now..

Affordable Alcatel 5, 3 and 1 smartphones get full official details at MWC 2018. Adrian Diaconescu February 24, 2018 1:00 pm. Pocketnow’s MWC coverage is made possible by InvisibleShield, which frees you to go everywhere with your mobile device without the fear of damaging your screen. To live fearlessly with your mobile device, visit. You may have thought you knew everything there was to know about TCL’s “re-imagined” Alcatel smartphone portfolio , but it’s only today that the affordable lineup is detailed in full. And yes, the Alcatel 5, 3 and 1 Series have a lot more going for them than just ultra-low prices and “FullView” 18:9 displays manufactured by parent company TCL.. Starting from the top of the food chain… sort of, we have to commend the Alcatel 5 for its “premium brushed metallic unibody design.” That may not sound so special for your typical flagship, but this “bezel-less” 5.7-incher is available now in “select markets” for a measly 230EUR.. Powered by a middling MT6750 processor, and merely sporting HD+ (1440 x 720) screen resolution, the Alcatel 5 stands out with a dual 13 + 5MP front camera setup, as well as a rear-mounted fingerprint reader capable of doing more than just unlocking the phone. Namely, you can use the biometric sensor as a shutter key for selfies or program it to launch a different app with each finger.. Oddly enough, the lower-end, lower-cost Alcatel 3 family includes a 3V model with a larger and higher-res 6-inch 2K (2160 x 1080) panel. The 3V is also set to run Android Oreo out the box, compared to the 5’s pre-installed Nougat flavor. Priced at 190EUR, the 6-incher pairs a single 5MP front shooter with a dual 12 + 2MP rear camera.. The Alcatel 3 and 3X are also part of a series “designed with beautifully curved lines, sleek 2.5D contoured edge glass, and curved backs”, with the former settling for a 5.5-inch HD+ display, while the latter bumps the size up to 5.7 inches, retaining the 1440 x 720 resolution.. Finally, the Alcatel 1X starts at a ridiculously low 100EUR with surprisingly respectable specs and features. We’re talking the same premium Face Key and fingerprint recognition “experiences” as the 3 and 5 series, as well as a FullView 18:9 display with a modest FWVGA. Above all, the 1X is optimized to provide a silky smooth experience with Android 8.1 Oreo (Go edition) software , likely performing just fine while packing a humble 1GB RAM..

more ... more .... more ... more .... MEMORY: 32 GB + MicroSD. View all photos (8). High screen-to-body ratio (77.36 %). Low pixel density screen (282 ppi). The Alcatel 5 boasts a metal unibody and employing an 18:9 screen aspect ratio, this new phone definitely looks sharp and detailed. Other high-end, premium features that accompany the Alcatel 5 include face unlock, a finger-print sensor, and a dual-front facing cameras.. Dimensions: 6.00 x 2.80 x 0.33 inches (152.3 x 71.1 x 8.4 mm). Weight: 5.08 oz (144 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 720 x 1440 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Digital image stabilization, Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama. Features: Time-lapse video, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 1500 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 18.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 19.6 days (470 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz.

Notifications: Haptic feedback, Music ringtones, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording. Other: NFC, VoIP, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 24 Feb 2018. Shopping information MSRP price: € 300. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Alcatel brings a premium touch to the budget market with the 5 Series smartphone. The Alcatel 5 Series is a good-looking budget device with some nifty features, but it may be style over substance.. The Alcatel 5 Series is a good-looking budget device with some nifty features, but it may be style over substance.. The Alcatel 5 Series is a good-looking budget device with some nifty features, but it may be style over substance.. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Alcatel is a brand that’s synonymous with affordability, but with its latest range of Android smartphones, there’s a clear attempt to bring some premium design features to the budget end of the market. We went hands-on with the top-of-the-line Alcatel 5 Series and found that it has some pleasant surprises in store.. The first thing that strikes you about the Alcatel 5 Series is the modern design language. This is a phone with slim bezels around the sides and bottom of the display. It’s quite square, with sharp corners, but it feels light and easy to handle. There is still quite a big bezel at the top, but it houses one of the phone’s headline features – the dual-lens front-facing camera.. The first thing you notice about the Alcatel 5 Series is the modern design language.. Combining a 13-megapixel lens with a 5-megapixel, 120-degree lens allows you to capture good-quality individual and group selfies. The camera app has face recognition built-in and when it detects more than two faces, it automatically switches to the wide-angle lens. We found that it worked quite well in testing and it’s a nice feature for selfie addicts.. Alcatel is also talking up its Face Key technology, which is facial-recognition security for unlocking your device. Apparently, it breaks down facial scans into more than a hundred data points to unlock your phone in under a second. We weren’t able to test it during our short time with the phone, but it’s a surprising feature to find in a phone this cheap.. The textured power key and volume rocker sit on the right spine of the Alcatel 5 Series, which has a metallic paint exterior, though it’s actually made of plastic. The back has an attractive brushed metal finish in gold or black, with a single camera lens ringed in silver, which is echoed in the fingerprint sensor directly beneath it. We like the look; it’s clearly inspired by flagship trends, but in the budget crowd, this kind of design is enough the make the Alcatel 5 Series really stand out.. We found the display in the Alcatel 5 Series to be bright and clear, though it only sports a resolution of 1,440 x 720 pixels, so it’s not the sharpest. It was LG that ushered in the 18:9 aspect ratio for smartphone displays, but it has fast become a standard – one that Alcatel has embraced. It’s not just the 5.7-inch Alcatel 5 Series display that’s 18:9, Alcatel’s entire lineup, including the 3 Series and even the 1 series, have adopted the same ratio.. The main camera is rated at 12-megapixels and seems to work reasonably well, though it’s not the fastest to load and snap a shot. That may be partly due to the octa-core MediaTek 6750 processor, which is backed by 3GB of RAM.. Alcatel 5 Series Compared To. The 5 Series is not the fastest phone around in terms of performance, but Alcatel obviously had to compromise somewhere to keep the price down. Switching from a flagship more than twice its price, there’s definitely a sluggish feel, but if you’re upgrading from an older budget phone, this will feel plenty fast enough.. Speaking of compromise, there’s only 32GB of storage onboard, but thankfully there is support for a MicroSD card, so you can add up to 128GB more.. The battery is a respectable size at 3,000mAh, but there’s no support for fast charging. You also won’t find wireless charging or water resistance for that matter. But we were pleased to find a USB-C port on the bottom and a standard 3.5mm audio jack up top.. To be fair, the Alcatel 5 Series is being offered for 230 euros (around $280) in Europe. Although it does have some stiff competition from the Honor 7X. and Moto G5S Plus , it’s a decent device that’s sure to draw some admirers. If you prize style over performance and love those selfies, then it could be a good choice for you. It will be coming to the U.S. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

The Alcatel PLUS10 is the future of tablets!. Amazing 10.1" IPS display for an immersive and full experience. Alcatel 5, 3 and 1 Series presented at Mobile World Congress 2018. TCL Communication Formally Introduces World’s First Complete 18:9 Smartphone Portfolio with the Alcatel 5, 3 and 1 Series at Mobile World Congress 2018. BARCELONA – February 24, 2018 –. TCL Communication today formally kicked off Mobile World Congress 2018, introducing its all-new and evolved smartphone portfolio, which features experiences that modernize its Alcatel smartphones, bringing flagship-style features and premium design language across the entire lineup. Alcatel will be the world’s first brand to deliver an immersive 18:9 display experience across each series in the portfolio, made possible by using custom-built displays leveraging parent company TCL’s award-winning television technology and bringing the immersive entertainment experiences to smartphone customers. The portfolio also features all-new Alcatel experiences such as Face Key, a facial recognition technology, and enhanced camera options that give users more control over how they capture the moments they want to remember and share. Additionally, TCL Communication is committed to the security of its Alcatel branded devices and will be offering regular Android security updates, on a minimum quarterly basis, on its most popular smartphones, including its all-new 2018 devices.. With Alcatel FullView 18:9 displays, all consumers will experience more screen space across the entire portfolio, offering more room for browsing the Internet, connecting with friends and loved ones via social media, catching up on the latest news and enjoying cinematic views for the entertainment they love. The Alcatel FullView18:9 displays also reduces the width of the phone, making each device feel smaller and easier to hold than comparable devices with the same display size.. “For nearly 20 years, Alcatel has been a leader at delivering high-quality, premium mobile technology experiences that are accessible to consumers around the world,” said Christian Gatti, Global President Alcatel Business Division and Executive Vice President TCL Communication. “As we introduce an all-new direction for our smartphone portfolio, we remain focused and committed to pushing the boundaries of what an affordably priced smartphone can be, providing even richer experiences and flagship-style designs for our customers around the globe.”. SIMGANIC : ALCATEL'S VISION FOR SIMPLET, ORGANIC INDUSTRIAL DESIGN. “In order to evolve our product portfolio, we needed to start by re-thinking the way we approached the design of our smartphones so that user interaction feels more natural and intuitive,” said Hagen Fendler, Chief Design Officer, TCL Communication. “With our newly introduced smartphone portfolio, we’re unveiling the beginnings of our new design philosophy we call SIMGANIC. This approach conveys organic and simplicity that aims at creating truly caring products with human centric perspective, allowing us to deliver iconic style with thoughtful details and the ability to standardize this philosophy across our entire lineup.”. The SIMGANIC design language can be seen and felt across Alcatel’s all-new 5, 3, and 1 series of smartphones. The series are broken down into the following:. Geared towards everyday lifestyle, the Alcatel 5 sports a bezel-less 5.7-inch Alcatel FullView 18:9 display, premium brushed metallic unibody design, octa-core processor and fast charging, which cuts smartphone battery charging time by half. It also includes experiences that are built for social media lovers to share, such as a dual front camera with 120-degree super wide-angle with LED flash, offering amazing self-portraits that capture three times more than a typical selfie, for stunning group shots. The intelligent camera intuitively switches from portrait mode to super wide-angle mode when it detects more than 2 faces in the shot.. The Alcatel 5 comes with a suite of intuitive photo editing tools called Social Mode, which will allow you to take photos in a fun and more efficient way. With Social Square, you can review recently captured photos in one half of the screen, while the camera viewfinder remains active in the other half. This enables customers to review pictures as quickly as they take them, while making it possible to take new pictures at the same time. Instant collage lets you mash up your best shots into pre-set arrangements. Each section of the collage is taken one-by-one using the camera viewfinder and shifts to the next shape as you progress through the collage. Photo booth brings back those nostalgic photo moments from the fair or friends’ parties by taking four pictures in a row, one shot per second.. The Alcatel 5 features several key experiences designed to deliver greater value to consumers, including Face Key which is a new level of facial recognition security that enables you to easily unlock your device by simply glancing at the screen. In a process that takes less than half a second, Face Key breaks down each facial scan into over a hundred data points to ensure a more reliable match.. The fingerprint sensor is conveniently located on the back, and will include functionality beyond unlocking your phone, such as doubling as a shutter key when taking selfies and keeping sensitive information locked away in privacy mode; additionally, the sensor is programmable allowing each individual finger to launch a different app or service, so you can go straight to your commonly used apps.. The Alcatel 5 is now available in select markets in Metallic Black and Metallic Gold for 229,99 Euros.. The Alcatel 3 series provides several great key experiences such as Alcatel FullView 18:9 displays, SmartCam, Face Key and fingerprint sensors below 200 Euros. The 3- series is designed with beautifully curved lines, sleek 2.5D contoured edge glass, and curved backs, for a comfortable fit..

The TCL-owned company unveiled a barrage of devices under the Alcatel 5, 3, and 1 series. We’ve had our fair share of leaks regarding these devices. Apart from the affordable price tags all the three series also boast of thin bezel FullView displays.. The Alcatel 5 is the marquee product of the bunch. It brings a brushed metallic look and a slew of features to be the top product. It sports a 5.7-inch display with HD+ 720 x 1440 pixels resolution. On the inside, a MediaTek 6750 SoC keeps things ticking with 2/3 GB of RAM. For the 2 GB variant, users get 16 GB of expandable storage and 32 GB for the 3 GB variant. It features a dual 13MP + 5MP front camera while the rear lens is just a single 12MP shooter.. The Alcatel 5 runs Android Nougat on a battery of 3,000mAh capacity and is priced 230EUR.. Stepping down a bit, the Alcatel 3 is a mid-range offering by Alcatel’s standards. It has three models: Alcatel 3V, Alcatel 3X, and Alcatel 3. This series can be a bit confusing as there are minor differences in specs everywhere. What’s oddly noticeable is that they have some premium features which even the Alcatel 5 does not. runs Android Oreo while the premium Alcatel 5 still chugs on Android Nougat. Also, the Alcatel 3V has a Full-Hd+ display while the Alcatel 5 simply has HD+ resolution. The Alcatel 3 series pricing starts at. UMIDIGI Z2 will have a 3D curved scratch-resistant back panel. And finally, there’s the Alcatel 1X that comes with Android Oreo (Go Edition) and a ridiculously low price tag of 100EUR. As you’d expect, the specs are nothing to write home about but sufficient for the light-weight Android Go.. Alcatel 1X has a 5.3-inch display with thin bezels and fingerprint reader at the back. The screen resolution sits at 480 x 960px. As for the processor, there’s a MediaTek 6739 clocked at 1.28 GHz with 1/2 GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage. The Android Oreo running phone sports either a 13MP or 8MP rear shooter depending upon the region where you buy. It does support EIS and 1080p video.. We’re just starting with MWC 2018, there’s plenty more to come as we look forward to an avalanche of launches coming up next week.. TAGS alcatel Alcatel 1X Alcatel 3 Alcatel 5 mWC 2018.

Living up to its long-standing reputation TCL brought a traditionally abundant roster of new phones to MWC 2018. Also, in keeping with tradition, most of these come in a large number of versions, with plenty of optional features.. That being said, the Alcatel 5 is a clear stand-out this year. Just like the rest of its siblings making a debut at the Barcelona venue, it comes with a trendy 18:9 display. However, TCL took things one step further by reducing the bottom chin on the handset to a minimum. Quite a distinct look if nothing else.. Following the Alcatel 5 in the lineup is a quartet a Alcatel 3 devices. The top tier of these being the Alcatel 3V. It comes with a much more traditional look, while still adopting an extra-tall 18:9 panel. it's a sizeable 6-inch one with FullHD+ resolution.. If you find 6 inches a little bit unwieldy, the Alcatel 3X brings that down to a more manageable 5.7 inches. It still keeps the trendy new 18:9 aspect, with a slight decrese in resolution and most other specs. Surprisingly, RAM is unaffected with a 3GB version also available. You also get a very different finish on this one.. Then comes the Alcatel 3 with a smaller display diagonal still, at 5.5-icnhes. The 18:9 aspect is intact, but unlike its 3X sibling, the regular version lacks a second camera on the back and is available with a glossy finish on its plastic body.. The Alcatel 3C also made an appearance at the show, but it has been official for some time now. It's the cheapest member of the 3 series that comes with a screen the same size as the 3V, but drops the resolution to HD+.. Moving on, we have the Alcatel 1X. It is the smaller than any of the 3 series at 5.3 inches and the resolution is pretty low at 960 x 480 pixel. Still, interestingly enough, the panel is also 18:9 - maintaining a nicely consistent look throughout the lineup. It is also part of Google's new Android Go program, which promises better performance for limited hardware.. Lastly, there is the Alcatel 1C. It has the same display, chipset, memory and camera setup as the 1X, but runs the custom alcatel breed of Android and has metal on its back. It is running Android Nougat too, which is rather dated at this point even for an entry-level handset.. alcatel 5 specification alcatel 3x specification alcatel 3v specification alcatel 3 specification alcatel 1x specification alcatel 3c specification Review comments (16).

Early 2016 saw it drop the OneTouch surname, and in 2017, it licensed its device designs and software to China-based company TCL. new leak suggests another change is coming down the pipeline: Alcatel might replace its popular Idol series of. A collection of renders published by Evan Blass reveal what six of Alcatel’s upcoming smartphones might look like. The new devices are reportedly slated for a 2018. The Alcatel 1X looks like a low-end or possibly midrange device. The Alcatel 3 has a glossy back finish and a fingerprint scanner, and the Alcatel 3C sports curved back edges, a fingerprint scanner, and what looks to be a rear-mounted speaker.. The Alcatel 3V, one of the high-end devices in Alcatel’s new lineup, has a. glossy cover like the standard Alcatel 3, but also a dual rear-camera setup. (It looks to be a more premium version of the existing Alcatel 3C , which has a similar finish but also two rear cameras.)

CNET también está disponible en español.. Sneak a peek at three new sub-$300 Alcatel phones. They're not ready yet, but here's a hint at what's to come with the Alcatel 5, 3 and 1 smartphones.. January 9, 2018 5:30 AM PST. Alcatel 5, 3, 1: What's the difference?. Alcatel is a phonemaker that often slides under the radar, but the company has made some pretty great value handsets in the past, so we like to keep an eye on what it's planning.. Ushered into a sun-lit luxury suite at CES 2018, Alcatel didn't share many details about its upcoming crop of new phones for the year. Rather, it took this time to preview three categories of devices, each selling for under $300 (price converts to AU$380, £220). All the new phones at CES 2018. They'll all have a few things in common: an 18:9 screen ratio, a fingerprint reader on the back and face unlocking capabilities. You'll be able to program different fingerprint to simultaneously unlock and open an app, say your inbox or the camera.. A note on face unlock: Expect that to look a lot more like the unsecured version we see on the Samsung Galaxy S8 , rather than Apple's Face ID, which has been deemed secure enough to handle mobile payments.. The Alcatel 5 series will hover in the $300 range. The multiple phones making up this tier are going to have the most advanced hardware of the bunch, with the best-looking designs. For example, the Alcatel 5 phone we saw had a backing that resembled brushed-metal, and a shiny metallic trim.. Meanwhile, the Alcatel 3 devices will sit at about $200 and under (converts to AU$250, £150). It was a phone from that model that had the largest screen and body, and a dual camera on its rounded, shiny back.. Finally, any phone in the Alcatel 1 range will cost $100 or less, which is insanely cheap (that's AU$130, £70). The mock-up we saw didn't even have a working screen, but it did show off the smallest body design and a grippier backing. There aren't a ton of sub-$100 smartphones, and although they're far from glamorous, we're always happy to see ultra-affordable options for first-timers and other cost-sensitive buyers.. Keep in mind that there will be multiple phones in each series. Why so many? Because Alcatel will work with regional carriers and retailers to streamline which particular models sells in which country. As a result, you might see a dual-camera 5-series Alcatel in one country, but only a single-lens variant in another.. Alcatel promised it'd get into the nitty-gritty specs next month, closer to the Mobile World Congress show that takes place every year in Barcelona, Spain. All the cool new gadgets at CES 2018.

Alcatel unveils its new 5, 3, and 1 series smartphones at MWC 2018. with 7 comments. We went hands-on with the Alcatel 5 and 3V at CES 2018, getting a glimpse of what Alcatel had planned for its Mobile World Congress (MWC) reveal; last week company teased the lineup headed for MWC on Twitter. Today, as promised, the firm officially unveiled the Alcatel 5, 3, and 1 series handsets at a press event. The lineup includes the Alcatel 5, 3X, 3V, 3, 1X, and the 1C.. The Alcatel 5 sports a near bezel-less 5.7 inch 18:9 aspect ratio IPS display with an HD+ (1440 x 720) screen resolution. The bezels are nearly non-existent on the sides and the bottom, compensated by the top bezel for the usual crop of sensors and cameras. The phone packs a MediaTek MTK6750 octa-core processor with 3GB of ﻿RAM and 32GB of internal memory, expandable via a microSD card up to 128GB. However, the device comes with Android N out of the box.. As for cameras, the device sports a single 12MP rear camera with a dual LED flash. Alcatel says that the rear camera can be interpolated to capture 16MP images. The front-facing camera, however, packs a dual-camera 13MP + 5MP set-up and also includes front-facing flash. Interpolation works with the front-facing shooters as well.. On the security side of things, the device not only employs a rear fingerprint sensor but also includes a facial recognition feature that Alcatel calls ‘Face Key’. The company claims that the device can be unlocked in “less than half a second” with the face unlock feature. The phone comes with a Type-C connector and includes ﻿fast-charging.. The Alcatel 5 is now available in its Metallic Black and Metallic Gold guises for €229.99 ($282.76).. The Alcatel 3V sports a 6-inch 18:9 aspect ratio IPS 2.5D curved display that packs a 2K (2160 x 1080) screen resolution. The phone comes with a MediaTek MT8735A quad-core processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, expandable upto 128GB via a microSD card. However, unlike the 5, the 3V runs Android O out of the box.. In the camera department, the phone comes with a 12MP + 2MP dual-camera setup at the back ﻿and a single 5MP front-facing shooter. Like the 5, the 3V houses a rear fingerprint sensor along with the Face Key face recognition feature.. The Alcatel 3V is available for €189.99 (approx. $233) in Spectrum Black, Blue, and Gold colors; it's odd that the lower-cost 3V offers a higher resolution screen that the company’s flagship offering, the 5.. Priced slightly lower than the 3V, the Alcatel 3X sports a 5.7 inch 18:9 aspect ratio IPS display with an HD+ (1440 x 720) screen resolution. It comes with a MediaTek MT6739 quad-core processor with the same storage options as that of the 5. The 3X runs Android N out of the box.. The phone houses dual 12MP + 5MP cameras on the backand a 5MP lens on the front. The fingerprint sensor is placed at the back of the device, with no mention of the face recognition feature.. The 3X will be available from April in Metallic Black, Blue, and Gold for €179.99 (approx. The lowest-priced device in the 3 series, the Alcatel 3 sports the same screen as the 3X, but with a 5.5-inch display size. It also packs the same processor as the 3X but borrows its storage options from the 3V (2GB RAM + 16GB storage). The device ships with Android O out of the box.. As for the camera, no dual-camera setup is present for either side. The phone make do with a 13MP rear camera and a 5MP front-facing camera. The fingerprint sensor, like with all its siblings, is present at the back.. The Alcatel 3 will be available from March for an asking price of €149.99 (approx. $184), coming in Spectrum Black, Blue, and Gold colors.. The most affordable of the line-up and the company’s first Android Oreo (Go edition) phone, the Alcatel 1X, packs a 5.3 inch 18:9 display with a single rear-facing 13MP camera. The highlight of this device is that it runs the optimized version of Android O, known as the Go edition built for entry-level smartphones with lower memory specifications. Along with the optimized OS, the device will also come with a new suite of popular pre-installed Google apps that are less demanding in terms of resources. These apps include Google Go, Files Go, Google Maps Go, Youtube Go, and Gmail Go. Chrome, Google Play, and Gboard have also been optimized for performance. It will also feature the Google Assistant for Android (Go edition).. This device is aimed at the masses that are first-time smartphone users or users that are looking for low-budget devices.. The 1X will be available from April for €99.99 (approx. $122) in three colors, namely Black, Blue, and Gold in a sanity finish. The Alcatel 1C, a 3G variant in the 1 series lineup, will be available from April in Metal Black, Blue, and Gold for €89.99 (approx $110)..

Join Date Mar 2016. TCL hasn't exactly been keeping a tight lip about its new lineup over the past few weeks. As expected, spearheading the bunch is the new alcatel 5. A flagship, if you will, although we don't really feel right referring to it like that, given it's mostly mid-ranger specs. To reiterate, those include a 5.7-inch, IPS panel, in the new and trendy 18:9 aspect ratio. TCL seems to have committed to the ultra-wide concept fully, even providing it in very cheap devices. Interestingly enough, the alcatel 5 has an HD+ (1440 x 720 pixel) panel, while its 3V sibling, joining it at the Barcelona unveiling has FullHD+. The main attraction with the alcatel 5, however, seems to be the design, featuring minimal side bezels around the display and an almost non-existent bottom chin. It looks pretty impressive, but could potentially be an issue with ergonomics, combined with on-screen navigation buttons. The body on the alcatel 5 measures 152.3 x 71.1 x 8.4 mm and weighs in at 144 grams. It's plastic all around, but does feature a metallic finish in gold or black. As for internals, the alcatel 5 is based on an octa-core MediaTek MT6750, combined with 2GB or 3GB ram and 16GB or 32GB of expandable storage. The camera setup includes a 12MP, f/2.2, 1.25 μm snapper, with a dual-tome LED flash and a few extra features, like EIS, Light Trace, Slow motion and Video story. The camera can also interpolate its photos up to 16MP, if you find the 12MP native resolution insufficient. Two snappers handle selfies: a 13MP, f/2.0, 1.4 μm, 120-degree main one, along with a supplementary 5MP unit and an LED flash. EIS is a thing on the front side as well. The Alcated 5 also offers some interesting selfie effects to play around with, although it should be noted that both snappers are fixed focus. Other specs on the alcatel 5 include an optional Dual Nano-SIM configuration, depending on the model variant and Cat.4 LTE speeds. Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with GLONASS, Wi-Fi b/g/n, microUSB 2.0 and an FM radio are also standard on every variant, while NFC will only be available on some. There is a rear-mounted fingerprint reader. A 3,000 mAh battery keeps the lights on and a rather dated Nougat ROM is powering the show. alcatel is also marketing a face unlock feature, it calls "Face Key", which seems to be a re-brand of the standard Android Face Unlock option. TCL is promising immediate availability for the Alcated 5 in select markets. Color options include Metallic Black and Metallic Gold and the asking price is a pretty competitive EUR230(R3271,35). Exchange Rate - 1 Euro = R14,22. Last edited by Sumen; 25-02-2018 at 08:34 AM .. Join Date Mar 2016. Eskom and Electricity: Load Shedding, Generators, UPS, Alternative Power.

Alcatel 5 Passes Through the FCC, Appears to Have an Aluminum Body. which TCL fully acquired in 2015, is perhaps best known. for its affordable Idol smartphone series, and all signs point to a big refresh in 2018. One of the upcoming handsets in the lineup — the Alcatel 5 — recently underwent FCC certification, and documents made public this week give a glimpse at its design and features.. The Alcatel 5 looks to have a brushed aluminum back cover,. and could be Alcatel’s 2018 flagship. (That’s compared to the Alcatel 1X , which is said to have a plastic body.) The FCC’s photos don’t give away much, but do seem to match previously leaked renders of. What we can glean from the pictures, though, is that Alcatel 5 will have a single rear camera and a USB Type-C port, won’t have a 3.5mm headphone port, and looks to have a 3,000mAh capacity battery.. It was a little over a month ago we first heard rumors of the Alcatel 5. More recently, press renders for six of the Alcatel’s upcoming smartphones — including the Alcatel 1X, Alcatel 3, Alcatel 3C, Alcatel 3V,. and Alcatel 3X — leaked in earnest. Presumably, they’ll launch at different price points.. We’ll likely learn more at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas, where Alcatel’s expected to announce the new Idol series..

Adrian Diaconescu February 24, 2018 1:01 pm. Pocketnow’s MWC coverage is made possible by InvisibleShield, which frees you to go everywhere with your mobile device without the fear of damaging your screen. To live fearlessly with your mobile device, visit. The world’s “first complete 18:9 smartphone portfolio” has been fully detailed moments ago at MWC 2018 in Barcelona, following a short CES preview in Vegas last month , and because it contains so many new Android devices, TCL’s modernized Alcatel-branded lineup deserves some further explaining.. Pocketnow ’s formidable duo of reporters on the ground at the 2018 Mobile World Congress has already got a little one-on-one time with the… five phones (one-on-five?), compressing their key selling points in a three-minute hands-on video.. We’re sure it won’t come as a surprise that the ultra-low-cost Alcatel 1X is the least good-looking of the bunch, although even that thing impressively manages to keep screen bezels thin while supporting both fingerprint and facial recognition.. The Alcatel 3 and 3X are largely similar in terms of specifications, but the latter can be configured with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage in addition to the 2/16 gig SKU that’s standard for the non-X 3. The 3X is also slightly bigger, with HD+ display resolution on both handsets.. But the Alcatel 3V is the largest and sharpest member of the 2:1 family, with a 6-inch FHD+ panel in tow, while the 5.7-inch HD+ Alcatel 5 has a completely bezel-less chin and dual front-facing camera going for it. The 5 and 3V are “now” available in “select markets”, with the 3 and 3X due out next month, and the Android Oreo (Go edition)-powered 1X scheduled for an April commercial rollout..

Adrian has had an insatiable passion for writing since he was in school and found himself writing philosophical essays about the meaning of life and the differences between light and dark beer. Later, he realized this was pretty much his only marketable skill, so he first created a personal blog (in Romanian) and then discovered his true calling, which is writing about all things tech (in English)..
