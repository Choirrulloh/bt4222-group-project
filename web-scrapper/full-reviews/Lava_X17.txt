Lava X17: Click the Best Selfies in Town Lava X17 is the newest budget smartphone in town capable of clicking out vibrant selfies. This handset comes in several colors and is presently listed on the official website. Let us take a closer look at the detailed set of attributes: Pros Lava X17 offers a 5-Inch IPS screen , exhibiting 1280x720 pixels , in terms of resolution. Powering the same is a 2,350mAh battery module. Android Marshmallow v6.0 is the designated operating platform. This smartphone measures 8.50mm in thickness. Dual-SIM support is rendered to the same followed by 3G and 4G VoLTE connectivity. Other specs include Wireless compatibility, Bluetooth support and GPS for navigation. In terms of internals, this handset houses a quad-core processor clocking at 1.3GHz. Cons Lava X17 isn’t the most powerful smartphone on display stacking in only 1GB of built-in RAM. Internal storage limit at 8GB is extremely modest for the given price point even with an expandable support, via the micro-SD slot. Moreover, the featured battery unit isn’t the best deal offered by Lava and hardly lives through the day. Unique Selling Points Purchase this smartphone for the potent rear and front shooters featuring an 8MP primary camera module with flashlight support. The main highlight has to be the 5MP selfie snapper bolstered by dual-LED flashlight. The 84-degree wide angle lens is capable of clicking wider selfies. Featured camera modules can also capture videos in Full HD. Most importantly, this might just be the cheapest handset for the given category.. Compare Price Specs Videos Best Sellers Similar mobiles.
