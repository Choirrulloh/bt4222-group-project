It is powered by a MediaTek Helio P20 processor and has 4GB of RAM. The 4000mAh battery provides good battery life. Lenovo K8 Plus design Lenovo K8 Plus specifications and software Lenovo K8 Plus performance, battery life, and camera Verdict. Lenovo’s newest smartphone, the K8 Plus, is yet another step in its journey with stock Android. Looking at the demand for smartphones running on vanilla Android, including its own Moto lineup, Lenovo has chosen to ditch its Vibe UI. ( Review ) was the first phone to get this treatment, and to further strengthen its stand, Lenovo has now added the K8 Plus to the list.. While the K8 Plus is not a part of the Android One family like the Xiaomi Mi A1. ( Review ), it many of the same boxes in terms of software. However, is the the only interesting thing about the K8 Plus? Let's find out.. If you have used Lenovo smartphones recently then the K8 Plus will look. Like most other options in the market, the K8 Plus has a metal body. One of the first things that will strike you about this phone is its small size. The K8 Plus slots in between the K8 and the K8 Note, making it comfortable for one-handed use. It has a 5.2-inch display with capacitive Android navigation buttons below it. Lenovo has opted for non-backlit buttons instead of on-screen ones, and we found them hard to hit in the dark.. The power and volume buttons are on the right, and the power button has a different texture which makes it easy to distinguish. On the other side there's another physical music button which is set by default to play/ pause music and switch tracks. The button can be remapped to other functions such as taking a screenshot or launching an app, which makes it useful.. The Lenovo K8 Plus is a dual-SIM device that has a tray on the left side. There are slots for two Nano-SIMs as well as a dedicated slot for a microSD card.. At the back, the K8 Plus has two cameras and a dual-tone LED flash. Below these is the fingerprint scanner which is easy to reach. It is quite responsive and we did not have trouble when unlocking the phone. The metal back is a fingerprint magnet which was very evident on our Venom Black review unit. The phone has a Micro-USB port at the bottom with grilles on either side, while a 3.5mm headphone jack is positioned on the top.. The K8 Plus is relatively thick, measuring 8.99mm and weighing 165g, which might feel bulky to some people. One reason is the 4000mAh battery that Lenovo has crammed into this phone.. The Lenovo K8 Plus sports a 5.2-inch full-HD display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. Viewing angles are good and colour reproduction is decent. If you like punchy contrast then you have the option to switch the colour mode of the display. Brightness is good enough indoors but you might have to avoid direct sunlight at times to see things clearly outside.. At the core of the hardware is a MediaTek Helio P25 processor, which is an octa-core chip clocked. The K8 Plus gets 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. A dedicated microSD card slot lets you expand the storage by up to 128GB.. The Lenovo K8 Plus has one 13-megapixel camera and another. The latter is used to measure depth. At the front, there's an 8-megapixel selfie camera along with a selfie flash. In terms of connectivity, the smartphone has two Nano-SIM slots and supports. 4G as well as VoLTE on both. Apart from that there is Bluetooth and WiFi b/g/n.. Android enthusiasts will be happy with the stock UI which is clean and brings some unity to Lenovo's lineup of Motorola phones. Other than a few preinstalled Microsoft Office apps, this phone is pretty much free of bloatware. Lenovo does offer you the option to install apps from a list during setup if you like. However, there's no explicit promise of Android updates like there is for Android One phones.. Lenovo has chosen good hardware for the K8 Plus, which is quite evident in the benchmark tests. managed to score 64,617 in AnTuTu, as well as 855 and 3745 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. We had the 4GB RAM variant for review and it could multitask easily with several apps running in the background. the phone has adequate power to deliver without any lags or stutter. We played games including Sniper 3D, Drifty Chase and Clash Royale, and all. ran well without any hint of lag. The phone does get warm after a long gaming sessions, but it didn't get too bad in our experience.. The Lenovo K8 Plus packs in a 4000mAh battery which is largely responsible for its thickness and weight. Battery life is good and the phone can run for a day and a half with regular use. During our review period the phone managed around one-and-a-half days of casual use and. In our HD video loop test, the phone lasted 13 hours and 49 minutes which is fairly good. The bundled 10.4W charger take a little over two hours to charge the phone completely.. Lenovo has gone with a pretty basic camera app which is easy to use. The HDR and camera mode toggles are easily accessible. You get Panorama and Professional modes plus the default still mode. Video recording tops out at 1080p 30fps for both the cameras.. Landscape photos taken with the K8 Plus are decent but lacked the sharpness we were expecting. HDR mode adds a weird tinge in daylight photos, and is hit-or-miss in most cases. Night-time shots are good and the camera does manage to keep noise under control if the area is lit well enough. Macros are quite good and the camera managed to capture good detail in daylight as well as low light conditions.. Depth mode is easy to enable and the output has very good separation between the background and the subject. However we found that the camera would lag after taking a couple of photos in this mode. The 8-megapixel front camera has a beautify feature which can be set manually or switched to auto. Photos taken with the the front camera are good and can be used on messengers and social networking apps. Also, the front flash is handy in dark areas.. Tap to see full-sized Lenovo K8 Plus camera samples. Lenovo is aiming for popularity by choosing stock Android and balancing features and cost quite well. The Lenovo K8 Plus is well equipped and manages day-to-day tasks really well. Battery life is good enough to take you through more than a single day of use. There is enough storage for average buyers, and the dedicated microSD card slot does not force you to choose between a second SIM and additional storage. Dual cameras are an attractive feature right now too. Camera performance could have been better in landscape mode, but there have to be some tradeoffs with budget phones. If stock Android and good battery life appeal to you, then the Lenovo K8 Plus does look like a good choice..

Why Lenovo k8 plus? 1) sounds quality is far superior then others phone within this range. 2) Camera quality is very good and u will not find front 8mp with flash in this range. 3) Though processor is not Snapdragon but it is ok 4) display quality is far better. 5) additional key for music is differentiate among all phones in this range. Awesome!! A premium phone in just pocket budget. 9.5/10 * People who saying no Volte in this phone is wrong. Actually they don't know about a smartphone. It has Volte and fast experience. ** It's really really must have phone.. A good battery phone with awesome sound clarity and HD screen.. Got this phone for 9000 on B.B.Days Looks__ phone looks very premium in hand, you should prefer to choose for venom black colour bcoz that varient looks more premium and classy..

Dolby Atmos: With good pair of headphones and HD music you get...lost..mobile loud speaker is just average n has some noise in full volume Decent Battery backup: 18hrs of battery back.... Metal body and finish feels premium. But if you are going after looks from design perspective it's not for you. It's a bulky and heavy device, check and compare dimensions. I read in articles that it doesn't have FM radio and 3.5mm jack but that is not the case. One issue you might find is that it doesn't have inbuilt Gallery app. You have to download an app from playstore, which can have annoying ads. Q: is this mobile contain selfie flash?.

News Lenovo K8 Plus Review: Decent dual-camera smartphone on a budget. Lenovo K8 Plus Review: Decent dual-camera smartphone on a budget. The Lenovo K8 Plus offers a dual-camera setup and near-stock Android experience on a budget, but is it worth the price?. Published: October 4, 2017 10:55 AM IST. Lenovo K8 Plus design and build. In the last two months, Lenovo has launched three new smartphones in India under its K-series. Called the K8, K8 Note and K8 Plus, all three smartphones run near-stock Android 7.1.1 Nougat out-of-the-box. Out of the three, two of them feature a dual-camera setup at the back. We have already reviewed the Lenovo K8 Note , and today its time we take a look at its younger sibling, the K8 Plus.. The K8 Plus is offered in two variants – 3GB RAM with 32GB storage for Rs 10,999 and 4GB RAM with 32GB storage for Rs 11,999. The smartphone is available exclusively via Flipkart. In its price range, the Lenovo K8 Plus will compete with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, Honor 6X and YU Yureka 2 to name a few. With popular smartphones competing against it in a crowded price segment, does the K8 Plus have anything worth going for? Read our review to know more. ALSO READ: Lenovo K8 Note review: Good smartphone with room for improvement. The K8 Plus is basically a compact variant of the K8 Note, and design wise, both smartphones are practically the same. You get a 5.2-inch full-HD display on the K8 Plus, as opposed to the 5.5-inch one on the K8 Note. Just above the display, you have an 8-megapixel front camera, the earpiece and LED flash, while the capacitive Android navigation buttons are at the bottom. The back comes with a metal plate, while the top and bottom sections are made of plastic. You have the vertically placed dual-camera module and dual-tone LED flash on the top, along with a fingerprint scanner below it. The edges are smoothly curved, and because the device is compact, it is easier to hold and operate with one hand.. The 3.5mm audio jack is placed on the top, whereas the microUSB port for charging and data transfer is at the bottom. The power / sleep button and the volume rocker is on the right, whereas the SIM card tray is on the left. Just like the K8 Note, the SIM card tray allows you to use two nano SIM cards along with one microSD card. So you no longer need to compromise on having to choose between a microSD card and second SIM. ALSO READ: Nokia 5 Review: The return of an icon, but this time with Android. The Lenovo K8 Plus also comes with a dedicated music button on the left, allowing you to quickly play / pause music, and skip tracks. The company also lets you customize the key for other functions. You can head over to Settings > Music Key, and use it for quick access to the flashlight, to start the camera, take a screenshot, or do nothing.. Before we jump into the overall performance, let’s first talk about the key USP of the smartphone, the dual-camera setup. Lenovo has gone with a setup of a 13-megapixel primary camera, supplemented with a 5-megapixel camera that acts as a depth sensor. While the main camera captures photos, the depth sensor helps to add DSLR-like bokeh effects to your photos. The camera app is slightly sluggish, and there is a significant shutter lag, from the time you click the photo, till the time it gets saved in the gallery.. Lenovo’s photo editor app also offers a couple of handy software tricks which lets you keep the subject in color, while the background is black and white. The app also lets you adjust the blur intensity, and crop the foreground, while replacing it with any background of your choice. As mentioned earlier, we have already reviewed the K8 Note and were not too pleased with the camera. And with that, I am eager to find out if Lenovo has done enough to improve things on the K8 Plus. ALSO READ: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Review. Cutting right to the chase, Lenovo sure seems to have made some improvements to the camera. Indoor still shots captured under ample lighting are bright, detailed and produce good amount of colors. And there is nothing much to complain about. Even outdoor shots captured under sunlight look good with adequate details. And the same goes with close-up shots too, where you can see the right amount of depth-of-field, good color reproduction and an overall sharp image. Low-light shots also turn out to be decent, at least considering the price point of the K8 Plus. Even the selfies captured on the front-facing 8-megapixel camera turn out to be decent. However, the dual-camera setup that is the highlight of the smartphone tends to disappoint. To begin with, you will need to tap and focus on your subject a couple of times to get the shot right. Also, there are certain areas that the depth sensor considers as foreground, even though it is the background. Take the below photo for an instance, the depth is applied properly at the back, but if you look at the side where the laptop is placed, it is in focus, instead of being blurred.. Now, in the following pictures, the bokeh effect is slightly better, where the sensor is able to measure the depth and apply effects properly. But then, when you closely look at the edges, especially after zooming in, you will notice the inconsistencies in applying the effect.. Next, let’s talk about the camera tools that let you apply black-and-white effects to the background while keeping the subject colored, and the crop background option. Because the camera isn’t properly able to gauge the depth, these effects go for a toss, and Lenovo needs to improve the algorithms to make those effects feel even more natural, rather than looking like a bad Photoshop job. Look at the example below, where it cannot determine the foreground, in the simplest of scenarios.. Just like the K8 Note, the K8 Plus also runs stock Android 7.1.1 Nougat OS out of the box. The smartphone runs on the June security patch, which is pretty outdated, considering the vulnerabilities Android OS regularly faces. However, unlike Google which rolls monthly updates for its Nexus and Pixel devices, Lenovo is only promising quarterly updates with bug fixes and security patches.. Powered by the MediaTek Helio P25 octa-core SoC, Lenovo had sent us the 4GB RAM variant of the smartphone. During my week-long usage, I did not come across any performance issues on the K8 Plus, and things ran pretty smooth, even with a few apps open in the background. In terms of bloatware, Lenovo has added Microsoft apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Skype, and none of these apps can be uninstalled. Besides these, the only other additions Lenovo has made is in the form of camera app, Dolby Atmos for enhanced audio listening experience and support for TheatreMax, which is a split screen VR mode.. Gaming performance on the K8 Plus is good. I had no issues playing games such as Sonic Dash and Super Mario Run. Even graphics intense games such as Asphalt 8: Airborne run smoothly, without any hiccups. However, after playing for about 10 minutes or more, the back of the device got slightly warm, which is normal.. Armed with a 4,000mAh battery, the Lenovo K8 Plus lasts about a day-and-a-half with moderate usage. I was able to get screen on time of a little over five and a half hours on my typical usage. With slightly heavier usage, I was able to easily get through the day. Sadly, there is no fast charging, and the battery takes about three hours to charge to full.. The Lenovo K8 Plus has a few things going in its favor. It comes with a design and build that is now standard for most affordable smartphones. Having a decent SoC and enough RAM, backed with near-stock Android helps to offer a good performance. The battery life on the K8 Plus is also impressive.. With the dual-camera setup being the highlight, the K8 Plus slightly disappoints. Standard photos turn out to be good, and the same goes with the selfies and low-light photos too. However, it’s the depth mode that goes for a toss. It isn’t that the K8 Plus cannot take decent depth shots, but it isn’t easy as point and shoot. You need the right setup, and proper lighting conditions to get the shot you want. ALSO READ: Honor 6X Review. If you can compromise on the dual-camera bit, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is a very good alternative in this price range. And if you still want to go for a smartphone with a dual-camera setup, the Honor 6X is a decent option in that price range..

The budget smartphone segment is hands down the most important smartphone category, for both consumers and companies. The reason for that is quite simple; because most buyers are interested in budget phones only. Xiaomi has been leading the charge here lately, but like last year Lenovo has taken it upon itself to battle the Redmi onslaught. Equipped with dual cameras and large batteries, Lenovo’s latest K-series phones are taking the competition to newer levels. While the K8 Note did not make it to our review table yet, the new K8 Plus seems like a worthy contender. We tested the phone thoroughly and this is what we found out.. If you talk about specifications, the Lenovo K8 Plus is a completely different beast than last year's K6 Power. However, both phones look quite similar on first glance. Like every other phone in this category, the Lenovo K8 Plus also has a metal build, with the top and bottom portions made out plastic to facilitate antenna placement. Its build quality seems good for the price range, but the metal back is quite slippery and it almost slipped out of our hands multiple times during our review period.. On paper, the 5.2-inch display suggests a smaller form-factor. However, with a large 4000mAh at the back and thicker bezels on the side, the phone looks and feels rather chunky. In terms of ergonomics, it can be used in one hand, but unless you have larger hands, you may have to shift your grip to reach the top of the display.. To add some novelty to the category, Lenovo has introduced a new physical button besides the volume rocker and power button. Lenovo calls this the music button, though you can assign it for other tasks as well. In default mode, you press the button for more than a second to initiate the assigned app or play/pause music. It work as intended and from a buyer’s perspective is a better implementation of the side button, unlike the Bixby button used on the high-end Samsung phones. Besides that, we feel that the two physical keys on the right side should have had better tactile feedback. Overall, for the K8 Plus, Lenovo has chosen functionality over form, which seems like a reasonable compromise.. Like the K6 Power, the K8 Plus also features an IPS LCD display, which is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Though the phone does not have 2.5D curved glass on top, the edges of the display are still smoothened for easy use. The colour fidelity of the display is decent and the same can be said about the sunlight legibility. Since this is an IPS panel, viewing angles are great. There is minor light bleed around the corners, but we don’t think it would be a deal breaker. The display is a smooth to touch, and is backed by Lenovo’s new stock UI.. Borrowed from Motorola, the UI used on the K8 Plus is very simple to understand and use. You get a proper app drawer, and an untouched settings menu. The icons are pretty similar to the ones used by Moto phones. Even the camera app is identical to the one we saw on the Moto G5s a while back. The phone is running on the latest Android 7.1.1 Nougat and like Moto phones, Lenovo has promised at least one update on this device.. The fingerprint scanner on the phone isn’t the fastest we have seen in this category. It takes a second more to unlock than any of its competitors, but is accurate.. The Lenovo K8 Plus is powered by a MediaTek Helio P25 SoC. Here, it is paired with 4GB of RAM, but there is a 3GB variant of the phone as well, which is slightly more affordable. From what we observed, the Helio P25 does a pretty good job here. There is no discernible lag while navigating the UI, browsing the web, watching Amazon Prime Video or just taking a picture. Using the camera does raise the temperature significantly. We got temperature readings of 40 degree celsius on the back, which is not particularly uncomfortable, but still on the higher side. While gaming, the recorded heat reading on the back were 41 degree celsius. Talking about gaming, we played demanding games on the phone like Vainglory and Asphalt 8 and both worked smoothly throughout, without any major hiccups. We did see some minor frame drops, but nothing that would break your gaming sessions. The level load times were also decent and at par with current competition .. The phone features Dolby Atmos certification. Hence, the audio quality via headphones is quite good and music lovers who are looking to buy a budget device should keep the K8 Plus under consideration. The pre-installed app offers various presets and toggles that music enthusiasts will appreciate. While we would have preferred a dedicated DAC to go along with the Atmos support, it’s perhaps too much to expect at this price.. The phone runs on a 4000mAh battery, which easily managed a work day even under heavy usage. So, you can easily play games on the phone for half an hour, stream couple of episodes, make a dozen calls, check social media, click pictures and still end up with over 30 percent charge by the end of a normal work day. In our battery test, the phone scored 8 hours and 6 minutes of screen-on time, which further bolsters our findings. Moreover, if you are not into heavy gaming or don’t end up watching entire episodes on your phone, you may get at least two days of use on each charge. In addition, the phone supports fast charging, so you can go from 0 to 50 percent in just under an hour. That’s not the fastest charging scenarios, but it works given the impressive battery life.. While the phone has decent performance and dependable battery life, its best feature is the camera. Lenovo is using a 13MP OmniVision sensor, which is accompanied by a 5MP secondary camera by Samsung, working as the depth sensor. This dual camera setup produces the best images we have seen on a sub-12K smartphone in a very long time. Images taken in ample light conditions have good details, decent colour saturation and dynamic range.. The low light capabilities of the camera are decent when you get the focus right. However, we found that white balance is a tad off in low light. It also takes a little more time to save the image.. The dual camera setup allows the phone to take Portrait images too. Lenovo calls it the depth enabled mode, in which you can change the aperture on the slider from anywhere between f/5.6 to f/0.8. This allows the user to add blur according to their liking. On top of that, Lenovo’s software does a decent job in keeping the subject in focus. It works better with people as subjects, rather than other objects. The phone also takes a second or two to save that image.. The front facing 8MP camera on the phone is relatively good. The camera captures a decent amount of details, while keeping the colour saturation on the warmer end of the spectrum. It produces soft photos (beauty mode) by default, which reduces dark spots and blemishes on your face. However, you can turn them off or change the intensity via a simple slider. The front facing camera also gets an auto HDR mode and flash, which does not add any extra value to the selfie taking experience.. (l-R) normal light, low light with flash. In short, the Lenovo K8 Plus is the best budget centric device you can buy right now. It has decent performance, dependable battery life and the cameras on both sides are quite good. We could nitpick that the metal back is a little slippery and fast charging isn't the best, but we reckon that it is not a deal breaker here.. The Lenovo K8 Plus goes up against the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi phones and the slightly expensive and older Moto G5 Plus. While all phones perform almost at par, the K8 Plus is slightly smoother than the Redmi Note 4 or Redmi 4. Its battery life is quite dependable and in the camera department, the K8 Plus is only bested by Moto G5 Plus .. Lenovo K8 Plus (Venom Black, 32.... Lenovo K8 Plus (Venom Black, 32....

I have no matter for all scrap we have on cell phone know, i just want to know if is good for phone call and txt-sms, that's y want to know. K8 plus or moto g5 pls reply.. I think it's good.am used this phone just 1week but prasent idon't have this mobile I will buy this phone soonly. This phone is quiet good based on specifications but as per my opinion this is the worst phone i have ever used. I have used other phones from different brands before, but none gave me such a bad experience as this. The dual camera is just a marketing gimmick, as it doesn't do anything too special. What the depth enabled mode does can be done with any normal photo editor. The shutter works slow, sometimes too slow. There are too many pre- installed apps some of which you can't remove, so eats up your space. The UI is not satisfactory, can't blame Lenovo though as they have used stock. There is no pre-installed application for gallery and music so you have to find your own, need not mention the ads you have to face in third party galleries. Speaking of software of the phone, its the worst amongst all the phones i have used. There are way too many bugs in the phone system. Sometimes calls don't get connected and you have to wait for at least 2 mins , with a totally blue screen on your phone. There are times when the time on the clock on status bar doesn't change, while the actual time on home screen does, which may lead you into trouble at times. There are many other problems with the software, which will not give you one of the best usage experience. The display and sound quality is pretty good. The phone does lag at times but not always. Been using this phone since 4months , didn't face any such heating issues. My advice is if you are going to spend 11000-12000 rupees, better not spend it on this phone.. often gets automatically restart while playing YouTube videos online or offline...or while playing music....purchased during big billion days but since a month after it got two updates...the problem is since one month...hope some software update make it solved... Pranav, 23 Nov 2017 Hi surya.... I hv recently purchased this phone, but i hv an issue with camera options. more Dz z d worst phn I ave ever seen um using it from last month b...after every three seconds it displays error in application kindly help me out to fix it.

Related Lenovo K8 Note first impressions: A spectacular offering for the price Lenovo launches K8 Plus with dual cameras at Rs 10,999. Price: Rs 10,999 Rating: ***1/2 Specifications: 5.2-inch IPS (1920 x 1080 pixels), Helio P25 processor, 3GB RAM, 32GB storage, dual SIM slot, microSD slot, dual rear camera (13MP + 5MP), 8MP front camera with flash, fingerprint scanner, 4G, VoLTE, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, Android 7.1.1, 4,000mAh battery, 165 grams Pros: Sturdy metal body, good front & rear camera quality in daylight, bright full HD display, excellent performance & battery life, stock Android Cons: No led notification light, non-backlit android buttons, rear camera has focus hunting issue & shutter lag Lenovo K8 Plus is the second device in the K8 range from Lenovo that offers dual camera setup and stock Android OS. While the Lenovo K8 Note is priced around the Rs 15k mark, the K8 Plus is for those on a tighter budget. The phone is essentially a compact version of the Lenovo K8 Note when it comes to design. You get a full metal unibody design which feels sturdy and feels good in the hand thanks to the added weight from the large battery. Like the K8 Note, this one also has a dedicated music key on the left which can be customized for other functions. What we did not like was that Lenovo skipped the notification LED light on the phone. While the K8 Note has a 5.5-inch display, this K8 Plus has a 5.2-inch display. Thankfully, Lenovo has kept the resolution at 1920 x 1080 pixels which means you get a higher pixel density. The screen is crisp, has excellent brightness, vivid colours and also impresses with slim bezels. Under the screen are touch sensitive Android buttons which work well but are not backlit. Lenovo has used an octa core Helio P25 processor along with 3GB RAM on the K8 Plus. With benchmarks as well as real-life use, the P25 performs quite like the Snapdragon 625. We had no issues playing high-end games like Asphalt 8 and faced no slowdown or sluggishness in usage even with over 25 apps running in the background. The phone comes with 32GB storage of which 24GB is ava i l abl e for yo u. Thankfully there is a dedicated microSD slot for storage expansion with support for up to 128GB cards. There is a 4,000mAh battery which easily delivers over a day and half backup regularly. Even with heavy usage, the phone managed to last over a day easily. Using the supplied charger, we were able to charge the phone from 15 to 100% in 2 hours which is great. Dual cameras are one of the current trends on flagship as well as mid-range smartphones. The K8 Plus offers a 13MP + 5MP setup with a dedicated depth effect mode in the camera app. In our usage, we noticed that the K8 Plus has slightly better edge detection than the K8 Note but you need to be careful with your subject placement. Image quality is good in daylight and even though noise creeps in indoors, the images are good enough for social media. One issue we noticed with dual camera mode is that it does not always lock focus — it sometimes keeps hunting for a lock and there is noticeable shutter lag in depth mode as well as when the camera is used in lowlight. Also, video recording is limited to full HD resolution. Up front is an 8MP camera with a selfie flash and wide-angle lens — image quality is good in daylight but Indoors and lowlight images suffer from excessive noise and soft details. All of these issues can be solved with software patches and we hope Lenovo issues them soon. Some of the other features we liked on the phone include the fast and accurate fingerprint scanner, loud and clear speaker output, excellent voice quality from the earpiece and Dolby Atmos audio enhancements. For the price, the Lenovo K8 Plus proves to be good value for money given its feature set and performance. The camera needs some work but for someone who wants a compact phone with stock Android and great battery life, the K8 Plus is one of the better options. You can also consider the Honor 6x for Rs 11,999 with similar features and performance along with a large 5.5-inch full HD display.. Want stories like this in your inbox?

It’s hard to comment on the K8 Plus’ photographic prowess, until I get to take the phone out into the real world and see clicked photos on a computer monitor. But taking photos around the demo zone I found the dual-camera setup was fairly impressive and photos looked sharp with less noise. The bokeh effect also didn’t look terrible during my limited time spent with the phone. You will find an 8MP selfie camera on the front, but I couldn’t test the selfie shooter at the launch event..

The budget smartphone segment wars are heating up with Lenovo launching another smartphone at a very good price today. The new Lenovo K8 Plus expands the Chinese giant’s portfolio of affordable smartphones in India. 10,999, it takes Xiaomi’s offerings head on.. Lenovo had announced the K8 series earlier this year, with the K8 Note being launched earlier in August.

The internal storage can be expanded up to 128GB using a dedicated slot for microSD cards.. Capitalizing on the new trend of dual cameras in smartphones these days, Lenovo has placed two cameras on the back – a primary 13MP RGB sensor for regular image capture and a secondary 5MP sensor for capturing depth information.

On the front, the K8 Plus comes with an 8MP camera with f/2.0 aperture and an 84-degree wide angle lens, along with an LED flash..

Other features of the Lenovo K8 Plus include a dedicated Music key that can be used to launch the music app, or resume/play music.

Lenovo K8, K8 Plus and K8 Note to get Android Oreo update next year. The K8 will be first one to receive the update in June 2018. Whereas the K8 Note and K8 Plus users will have to wait until July 2018.. Published: Wednesday, October 18, 2017, 12:29 [IST]. Lenovo had unveiled the K8 Note in India couple of months back. Soon after that, the K8 and K8 Plus were also launched.. If you use any of the aforementioned smartphones, we have a good news. These are the only Lenovo devices that will be getting the Android 8.0 Oreo update. The information comes from the company's official website. However, the Android 8.0 Oreo update will not be rolled out to the K8 series smartphones before next year. The K8 will be first one to receive the update in June 2018.. Whereas the K8 Note and K8 Plus users will have to wait until July 2018. Currently, all of them run on Stock Android 7.1.1 Nougat OS. Since Stock Android doesn't take much time for upgrades, it is unclear why Lenovo is taking so long to release the Oreo update.. Android Oreo update will add a lot of new features to the smartphones including picture-in-picture mode. This mode will let users simultaneously watch YouTube videos and use other apps. This feature is already available on the current version of iOS. However, users can only watch videos running on Safari web browser. The YouTube app does not allow any such feature on iOS as well.. Another feature that makes Oreo a much better improvement over Android Nougat is the notification visuals. Users will be able to view the notifications with much clarity and with several options provided for each notification.. Always-on display along with auto fill has also been provided in Oreo update as well. Auto-fill allows signing into apps more quickly and easily. There are also several options available for any text selection made on Android Oreo.. Google is calling the feature smart selection as it provides users with additional options according to the text selected. For example, if you select an address, Oreo will offer you an option to look it up on Maps..
