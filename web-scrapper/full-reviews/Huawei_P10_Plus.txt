But in comparison with what else is on the market, its proposition falls apart. It’s not the best in the flagship price category, and there are phones offering almost as much that cost less. Hope you Leica taking photos Dual-lens camera QHD screen Design More colors than a primary school classroom Slim and stylish The basic metals, namely Graphite Black, Mystic Silver and Rose Gold.

The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus launched at Mobile World Congress in an unusual year, when Huawei didn’t have Samsung to steal its thunder. That said, the Leica-branded P10 still didn’t manage to be the star of the show – although, really, what could beat the Nokia 3310 ? – and its larger sibling didn’t raise too much excitement either.. At £679.99, the Huawei P10 Plus is priced right up there with the best, but doesn’t offer the waterproofing of the iPhone 7 Plus nor the wireless charging of the Samsung Galaxy S7 .. It also reuses the Huawei Mate 9 ’s chipset, and while 6GB of RAM is great to see, that’s also available in the OnePlus 3T at almost £300 cheaper.. Meanwhile, Huawei’s EMUI interface is better than it once was – but when it’s up against Google's stock Android in the Pixel XL , it can’t win on that front either.. Combine this with some daft decisions – average sound quality; a confusing home/soft key combo; and not releasing in the US; and it’s difficult to recommend this phone. It’s not bad by any means, but it’s not the best at anything either.. For this phone, Huawei continued its partnership with Leica from the Huawei P9 , although thankfully there was less of a focus on awkward celebrity spokespeople this time (we will never believe Superman and Black Widow use a Huawei, sorry guys).. Instead, we have dual cameras with no hump whatsoever, and photography is rightly the key selling point of the device. At 20MP and 12MP, these lenses combine monochrome and RGB sensors with a creative Wide Aperture mode to make photography really enjoyable, often with pro-level results.. The spacious QHD screen and generous RAM allowance are also high points on the spec sheet, and Huawei made a huge song and dance of offering an insane amount of color choices, including Pantone’s color of the year (unfortunately mushy-pea green).. However, you can’t get any of those colors in the US, because you can’t get the phone there at all. And at £679.99 in the UK, the big P10’s plus points are looking a little overpriced.. In Australia however, the Huawei P10 Plus is available only in black for AU$1,099, which is puts it in the flagship arena at a much cheaper price point than many of its competitors.. The first thing you’ll notice about the P10 Plus – other than its size, which presumably you were expecting – is that it’s surprisingly thin. At exactly 7mm, it’s 0.3mm slimmer than the iPhone 7 Plus, and you can bet your bottom dollar that was intentional.. The P10 Plus resembles its Apple competitor more than a little, too, but these days we’d be hard pressed to find a flagship that didn’t. It’s got the classic all-metal unibody with rounded corners, and a dual-camera setup on the back.. This is embedded in its antenna bar at the top, with no camera bump whatsoever: again, ner ner Apple. And of course, there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, because – well, you get the picture.. On the comfortably curved bottom edge, you’ll find a solo speaker, centred USB Type-C port and that much-loved headphone jack.. Switch to the top and you’ll find an IR blaster, something that’s becoming a bit of a rarity lately. The top of the left edge houses the SIM and microSD slot, and on the right edge there’s the volume rocker at the top, and, on our Graphite Black handset, a rather lovely etched power key edged in red.. This one little design touch is surprising given the low-key look of the rest of the phone, but there are many (MANY) other color options available if you’d like something more fun.. There are seven versions of the Huawei P10 Plus in all:. Of course, if you want anything other than black, it’ll be a toss-up whether your country and network offers it.. Always the way with funky colors, like the Google Pixel ’s ‘Really Blue’ option that turned up many months after the black and silver versions (in the UK, at least).. Taking the P10 Plus out of its rather beautiful double-doored box, you’ll go to peel off the plastic screen covering and find another one underneath.. Some manufacturers, like OnePlus, have started pre-applying plastic screen protectors to new phones – presumably to save people who buy them from bubbles and misaligned edges – and it seems Huawei has joined them.. You can peel the protector off very easily, and you’ll be tempted to because it feels and looks really horrible on your expensive box-fresh phone.. However, the screen is surprisingly not oleophobic (which is a coating applied to most phone screens to repel oil), so if you do remove the protector, not only are you more susceptible to smashing but your phone will become a disgusting grease-fest too. On the bright side, the display does come with Gorilla Glass 5, so you have some inbuilt crack protection even without the plastic cover. It’s bright and colorful, with slim side bezels, and somehow looks more integrated into the phone than many. It won’t outshine a Samsung panel, but it’s plenty pretty enough for most.. It’s also good enough for mobile VR, with the generous size, 1440 x 2560 resolution and 540 pixels per inch giving an immersive experience even right by your eyeballs..

It takes the decent P10 and improves it in a variety of ways.. Its Leica camera is excellent in both light and dark scenarios, battery life is impressive and it comes with a generous amount of storage. It’s the first Huawei handset that can easily compete with big-name flagships such as the LG G6 , iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 .. It isn’t perfect – there are a few frustrating missteps along the way – but with the P10 Plus Huawei has taken a significant step forward from churning out forgettable budget phones.. Huawei has been improving its basic design for some time now, tweaking its formula with every release rather than starting afresh each time. The P10 Plus continues in this vein, but with useful changes to keep it from feeling stale.. It’s clear that the design influence here is the iPhone 7. It isn’t unusual to see Android phones that resemble Apple’s flagship, but the P10 Plus takes it up a notch.. From the matte-black colour scheme, to the curved sides and flat back, the P10 Plus is almost a dead-ringer for the iPhone 7. Unoriginality aside, I’m not complaining too much about this. The P10 Plus feels great to hold; it’s thin, light and even with its 5.5-inch display I can comfortably grip the device in one hand. Initially, some may find that completely flat rear a little slippery, but you’ll quickly get used to it.. A notable change from the P9 is the placement of the fingerprint sensor. Previously, it sat just below the camera sensors on the rear of the phone; in the P10 Plus it moves to the front.. The position is fine – although my personal preference is for it to be on the back – and it’s among the fastest fingerprint sensors I’ve experienced. Even with a minimal touch, it zips you right past the lockscreen to the homescreen.. I’m also a big fan of the gestures that Huawei has built into the button. Alongside acting as the home button, a lighter tap takes you back and a swipe across the pad brings up the multi-tasking menu.. It’s all very intuitive, and it removes the need for any on-screen buttons on the display, resulting in slightly more screen real-estate. Even if you find it odd at first, stick with it – after a few hours’ use it will become second-nature.. I loved the matte-black colour scheme on the iPhone 7, and I remain a fan of it on the P10 Plus. However, Huawei has also teamed up with Pantone to offer other, slightly unusual options. ‘Greenery’ is Pantone’s ‘ Colour of the Year 2017 ’, and is one such hue that I really like. The P10 Plus is also available in ‘Dazzling Blue’ and a rather bog-standard gold. The blue and green variations feature a a ‘diamond cut’ pattern on the rear, which is heavily textured and is therefore supposed to offer greater scratch resistance..

If Huawei really wants to battle the likes of the LG G6, iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 – all of which are at least IP67 protected – it needs to match this most useful of features.. At times, the Huawei’s display is one of my most favourite things about the P10 Plus – but it’s also the phone’s biggest weakness.. In terms of resolution and quality, it excels. The 5.5-inch LCD IPS-NEO panel with a quad-HD (2560 x 1440) resolution looks superb. It doesn’t quite offer the inky blacks and saturated colours of an AMOLED panel – featured in the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , for example – but it isn’t far off. The use of an IPS panel also means the P10 Plus lacks support for Daydream VR .. Out of the box, the colours on Huawei’s display are a tad on the cool side – which is my preference anyway – but you can tweak them in settings to warm them up. Whites can sometimes look a little pinkish or yellow when scrolling, but this is a minor issue.. The screen is capable of going fantastically bright, and for much of the time I was happily able to keep it at 45-50% without running into any issues. The auto-brightness is accurate, too – something I often have trouble with on Android phones.. Related: Best Android Phones But there’s a problem – and it’s a big problem. On unboxing the P10 Plus, you’ll discover that it comes with a flimsy plastic screen protector already in place. Remove it, however, and the screen will no longer benefit from an oleophobic coating.. You’ll find this covering on pretty much every phone, and its purpose is to stop smudges and oily residue building up. So, if you remove the screen protector from the P10 Plus – and I did, since it was scratched and almost peeling off after a few days – you’ll have a phone that becomes horribly grimy after only a few minutes’ use.. I struggle to forgive Huawei for missing off such a basic feature, especially considering the asking price of the phone.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network. 
Huawei P10 + P10 Plus review: Great phones, with one fatal flaw. Huawei puts in a strong showing in two different form factors — but the P10 and P10 Plus are diminished by a couple of baffling design decisions.. Huawei's mainstream flagships for 2017 don't necessarily look flashy — unless you opt for the exclusive "dazzling" color options — but they do deliver just about everything you could ask for in a modern Android phone. The lack of oleophobic coating on the display may be a reason for discerning buyers to skip this round of Huawei phones.. Huawei P10 series Video review. Great camera performance in P10 Plus. All-day battery life from the P10, even more from the Plus. EMUI no longer a total eyesore.. No oleophobic coating below factory fitted screen protector. f/1.8 Summilux lens exclusive to P10 Plus. No oleophobic coating below factory fitted screen protector. Did I mention there's no oleophobic coating below the factory fitted screen protector?. We're publishing this review after a couple of weeks of on-and-off use of the Huawei P10 (VTR-L29, dual-SIM, 4GB/64GB) in "dazzling blue" and P10 Plus (VKY-L09 single SIM, 6GB/128GB) in black on the EE and Vodafone networks in the UK, and roaming on Orange in Barcelona, Spain. Our P10 was running software build 108 until about a week into testing, when it was updated to build 112. Our P10 Plus was running build 110.. Both phones were given to us shortly after the P10 launch event in Barcelona; Huawei reps tell us both units are representative of retail P10 devices.. Huawei P10 series Full review. 2016 was a transformative year for Huawei. The Chinese firm with a reputation for sullying its great hardware with gross software really got its act together. Throughout the year, Huawei gradually chipped away at annoyances in its EMUI interface, before overhauling everything in the much improved EMUI 5.0 release on the Mate 9. And even with slightly weird software, the P9 series sold well globally, surpassing 10 million shipped by the end of 2016. In the UK, it established a presence on all four major networks (plus Carphone Warehouse.). This year, the challenge for Huawei is to build on all those positive developments without losing momentum — starting with two new high-end phones, the P10 and P10 Plus. Like its immediate predecessor, the P10 series offers a similar hardware package across two screen sizes, contained in a classy, understated metal shell.. The external hardware is as good as ever, and EMUI is light years ahead of where it was a year ago. So what could possibly go wrong?. Depending on which color and finish you pick up, the Huawei P10 lands somewhere on the spectrum between pedestrian and eye-catching. In its standard brushed, anodized aluminum finishes — which includes staple colors like silver, black and gold — the P10 has a remarkably iPhone-like appearance. (Look no further than the curved antenna lines, apparently lifted straight from Apple's phone.) As such, it inherits many of the pros and cons of that particular design. It's well-built and comfortable in the hand, but a little slippery, particularly in the 5.5-inch Plus model.. In its more extravagant "dazzling" color options, which includes the "dazzling blue" P10 I've been using for the past couple of weeks, the back plate has a truly unique look, feel and sound. Huawei calls this "hyper diamond cut" — I'd describe it as an extremely finely-cut texture etched into the aluminum — and it makes the back of the device feel unlike anything else out there. It shimmers as the phone rotates through light, and if you scratch the tip of your finger against it it sounds a little bit like a nail file. And there's a pleasing contrast between the glossy, curved side walls and the more industrial finish of the back.. The texture is supposed to be more scratch-resistant than a traditional brushed, sandblasted finish — and while that's mostly true, it certainly will chip given enough encouragement, leaving you with speckled silvery areas if it scrapes concrete or metal surfaces.. Elsewhere, there are plenty of design holdovers from last year's P-series phones, including the glass camera window up top, which sits flush with the surface of the metal. The neat red accent around the power key also adds some visual flair.. Huawei's 'hyper diamond cut' finish has its own unique look, feel and sound .. But the design as a whole is entirely more rounded than last year, in contrast to the angular P9 and Mate 9.. Like those previous models, Huawei's latest creations include a pretty decent speaker setup, combining a bottom-firing main speaker with an additional tweeter behind the earpiece, as part of a pseudo-stereo setup. The Mate 9's output sounds a touch bassier to my ears, and less tinny at high volume levels. Still, the P10 puts in a respectable performance, going louder than rivals like the Google Pixel and LG G6 with less distortion.. The P10's front face is as minimalist as any Huawei design to date, with the prominent Huawei branding of most of its other handsets having been replaced by the new front-mounted fingerprint scanner. It's a very deliberate change — one Huawei representative told me that the cleaner design might stop consumers pre-judging the phone based on its bearing an unfamiliar brand name. Another possibility is that the "hyper diamond cut" finish may have been difficult to include alongside a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.. The sensor itself, built into the glass this time, for what that's worth, feels and functions about the same as previous Huawei fingerprint scanners — which is to say it's lightning-fast and a joy to use.. Which, on the face of it, is great. The standard P10 packs a 1080p LCD over 5.1 inches, with the Plus stepping up to Quad HD over 5.5 inches. Both offer excellent viewing angles, high brightness levels, even outdoors, and vibrant colors, with the slight blueish hue seen in earlier Huawei phones. (White balance is adjustable in the display settings menu, for what it's worth.). Huawei includes a factory-fitted screen protector in the P10 as standard, just like most of its other phones. However unlike the P9 and Mate 9 — and even cheaper models like the Nova — neither P10 has an oleophobic coating on the screen. (That's the smudge-resistant layer included as standard in the vast majority of phones, without which the display quickly becomes smudgy and greasy.. We've got a whole other article on why this is an insane decision about which someone should feel bad. But briefly: For me, it's almost a deal-breaker. And for your own sanity, please keep the factory-fitted screen protector attached if you plan on picking up a P10.. In a bizarre move, the Huawei P10 doesn't include an oleophobic coating behind its factory-fitted screen protector.. An oleophobic coating may sound obscure and technical, but it's a staple feature of all but the cheapest smartphone screens. This nanocoating, usually applied to the glass during manufacturing, repels oils — like the kind on your face and fingers — and stops the display getting gunked up with use.. PSA: Don't remove the Huawei P10's factory-fitted screen protector. At least there are no weird compromises on the inside of this thing. Both P10s are based on the same Kirin 960 platform as the Mate 9, meaning there's plenty of performance to go around, whether it's paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage in the smaller P10, or 6GB/128GB in the Plus.. And Huawei has specifically targeted touch latency in its performance tweaks in EMUI 5.1 — a big part of what makes a phone feel fast. So between the proven horsepower of Huawei's homegrown chip and further software optimization, both phones are absolutely blazing fast. That high performance extends to gaming too, thanks to the new ARM Mali-G71 GPU.. 5.1" FHD, 2.5D glass, Corning Gorilla Glass 5. 5.5" WQHD, 2.5D glass, Corning Gorilla Glass 5.

After the rebirth of EMUI on the Mate 9 , Huawei didn't need to do a whole lot to translate that experience onto a smaller screen, and so the new EMIU 5.1 — still based on Android 7.0 — looks and functions much the same as before. (Albeit a little quicker thanks to the special attention given to touch responsiveness in this update.). This is still a very customized version of Android, though the core of EMUI is cleaner and less cluttered than previous iterations. Android's notification center is mostly unmolested, save for Huawei's customized quick settings implementation and a separate permissions system for lock screen notifications, which can be a bit confusing. Most of Huawei's preloaded apps use the same cool blue and white hues that you'll find throughout the menus — which is smart and inoffensive, though not entirely in keeping with Android's design direction as a whole.. Chances are EMUI looks and works differently to what you're used to in an Android phone.. EMUI 5 is as customizable as ever, with Huawei's Themes app allowing you to kit the P10 out with a range of themes, some genuinely nice-looking, others decidedly vomit-inducing. Each color of P10 is preloaded with its own color theme, which is a nice touch, but there's still a weird dissonance between the embossed, over-the-top-colorful icons and backgrounds in these themes and the rest of EMUI.. While much of the focus of EMUI 5.1 has been under-the-hood tweaks, there are a couple of user-facing additions. Huawei has partnered with GoPro to include the camera maker's Quik application on the P10, giving you an easy way to conjure up highlight reels with transitions and music matched to your photos. The feature set offered here isn't all that new — HTC experimented with this type of functionality in its Zoe app years ago, and Google Photos has a similar feature, though with much less manual input. While the P10 Plus comes with display (DPI) scaling options, letting you see more on screen at once, this isn't enabled on the regular P10. The P10 and P10 Plus both support VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling on EE in the UK, a first for Huawei, and a good indicator that future software updates may bring this to phones like the Mate 9.. You've also got some intriguing options for changing up Android's soft keys (back, home and recent apps.) Like the Mate 9 Pro, the P10 lets you use gestures on the front-mounted fingerprint scanner to replace the standard on-screen buttons. A single tap sends you back, a long press takes you home, and a swipe gesture takes you to your recent apps. It's a decent idea in theory, but I never fully wrapped my head around this new button dynamic, and retreated to the safety on-screen keys pretty quickly. It didn't help that the swipe gesture for recent apps failed to trigger reliably every time.. So there are no massive changes from EMUI 5 to speak of, and the overall experience, in terms of both visuals and performance, boils down to that of using the Mate 9's software on a smaller display. Android purists may still be unimpressed with Huawei's customization and the many iOS influences throughout the software, but EMUI 5.1 fast, responsive and easy to tune to your own preferences.. A couple of other software nuggets from EMUI 5.1:. We're a year into Huawei and Leica's strategic partnership, which has yielded some dramatically improved camera performance, and there are some big changes in the P10's imaging setup, in both the hardware and software.. First, both P10 models have grown a new portrait mode, which is similar in a lot of ways to the feature of the same name from the iPhone 7 Plus. The optics of Huawei's cameras are different — there's no zoom lens, for instance — so there's more heavy lifting being done in the post-processing. Huawei's camera app and Kirin ISP pair up to re-light your subject's face on the fly, smooth out blemishes and artistically defocus the background. Portrait mode also makes colors pop a little bit more, which leads to shots taking on a slightly surreal quality compared to iPhone portraits.. Many of the same features also work with the P10's 8-megapixel selfie camera — the front facer is now Leica-certified as well, and situated behind a bright f/1.9 lens. Huawei's selfie software can detect how many people are in a shot, and defocus the background accordingly, bringing out the appropriate details in the faces of both you, your friends, and any photobombers.. The P10 Plus comes really close to the Pixel and G6 in most lighting situations.. On paper, the optics of the second-gen Leica camera setup in the smaller P10 haven't changed at all since the Mate 9. You've still got two f/2.2 Leica Summarit lenses, one housing a 12-megapixel color sensor (with optical image stabilization and 1.25-micron pixels), another packing a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor without OIS. (Alongside laser autofocus for faster focusing in the dark.). As such, the results from the regular P10's photographic capabilities closely match the Mate 9's — taking into account the past few months' worth of software tuning, of course. You'll get legendary dynamic range thanks to the dual-sensor setup, and generally solid performance, though with some fine detail loss in challenging lighting compared to cameras like the LG G6 and Google Pixel.. The big camera hardware upgrade has been reserved for the P10 Plus, which introduces dual f/1.8 Leica Summilux lenses — significantly brighter than the smaller model's lenses, for improved low-light captures. And while I think the Pixel and G6 still pull ahead in night-time shots, the P10 Plus is really, really close, to the point where most people won't be able to tell the difference.. The P10 Plus takes a great camera experience and gives it an even better lens.. There are only a couple of very specific areas where I've noticed weaker performance from the P10 Plus. Firstly, in high-contrast scenes with lots of brighter and shaded areas, Huawei's camera struggles to retain color detail, with some areas of certain shots being rendered in black and white, even in full color mode.. And Huawei still isn't quite up there with the best in terms of video recording. Despite the inclusion of OIS, and a software stabilization mode, there's a decent amount of ghosting in moving shots, and fine detail is lost in shots with uneven lighting — more so than most other high-end phones.. So if photography is a priority, definitely go for the P10 Plus — it's got a dependable Auto mode for most kinds of shots, some intriguing artistic modes to play around with, and that all-important manual mode for great long exposures at night.. Huawei P10 series Battery life. Between relatively large battery capacities, homegrown processors and tight software controls for background apps, Huawei phones have always punched above their weight in terms of battery life. And I'm happy to report that the P10 and P10 Plus are no exception.. With the P10, you're getting an ample 3,200mAh cell, which is a little above average for a phone of this size, with some extra power savings coming from the use of a 1080p display. The P10 Plus steps up to a more capacious 3,750mAh cell, which is more than sufficient to offset the step up to both a 5.5-inch panel and a resolution of 2560x1440.. Even the smaller P10 delivers outstanding battery life for this type of phone.. In day-to-day use, the smaller P10 actually reminded me of the performance I got out of the Huawei-made Honor 8 , in that it'd just keep going, even with relatively intensive use on LTE, often in not-so-great signal areas. Essentially, I never had to worry about not getting a full day out of the P10, though the kind of multi-day longevity I've had from the Mate 9 was outside of the phone's reach.. The P10 Plus followed a similar pattern, holding up well against heavy use, and sometimes leaving me with 50 percent in the tank after a day out and about. With those kind of usage patterns, I was looking at around five hours of screen-on time per charge. Again, that's a step below the Mate 9, but in a phone with a smaller battery and a higher screen resolution.. Both phones benefit from Huawei's extra-quick Super Charge technology as well, which requires a special cable as well as a plus-sized Huawei Super Charge plug. First seen on the Mate 9, Super Charge is the only charging tech I've used that rivals OnePlus's Dash Charge, powering up the P10 at up to 5A and 4.5V (or 4.5A at 5V). That means faster recharges with less heat generated compared to other quick charging methods, which use higher voltages. On both models, up to around 80 percent, you can practically watch the percentage numbers tick up.. Combining the ability to complete a meaningful recharge in around 30 minutes with great battery life in general , the Huawei P10 emerges as an excellent performer.. Should you buy the Huawei P10? Yes, but.... Personally, the whole oleophobic kerfuffle with the Huawei P10 has considerably dampened my enthusiasm for these phones. This is a core hardware feature which has been the norm in just about every flagship smartphone for the past decade. The P10 forces me to choose between two bad options: leave the screen protector on and deal with a display that feels like crappy plastic, or take it off and live in a frustrating hellscape of screen smudges.. When you're paying north of £550 for a flagship phone (either upfront or over the course of a contract), that's a choice you shouldn't have to make.. At the risk of stating the obvious, the display is the primary input and output device on a phone. It's the one thing you're constantly looking at and touching. For a company as established as Huawei to compromise it in this way defies reason.. The P10 earns itself a grudging recommendation, with a major asterisk attached.. It's pretty clear this phone is supposed to be used with its pre-fitted screen protector attached. although the entire glass front isn't covered by the film.) If that's OK with you — and for many people it'll be perfectly acceptable — then great. Buy a P10 and enjoy it. You'll get a good-looking device with great performance and a fantastic camera. For others it'll be a deal-breaker. I'm somewhere in the middle, hence the grudging recommendation.. That's a shame, because the rest of the Huawei P10 is great. Were it not for my reservations over the screen, the P10 would certainly qualify as one of the best Android phones out there. And the P10 Plus comes with that extra bit of icing on the cake — a brighter lens for some amazing low-light captures, and the option to spec it out with oodles of RAM and storage.. Above all, these phones show that for all the progress Huawei has made, its products can still be derailed by one or two bad decisions.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus prove that incremental improvements eventually start to stack up.

Back in April 2016, Huawei’s P9 and P9 Plus entered into a highly competitive smartphone market with high-end specifications, Leica-branded dual cameras, and a really sleek design. But that was almost a year ago, and focus has now shifted to their successors, the P10 and P10 Plus.. The Huawei P10 is not a perfect ten, as enticing as that wordplay would be. But it, and its larger P10 Plus variant, come as tantalizingly close to achieving that milestone as any P series devices ever have. While the flagship Mate series typically comes in bigger and better, the more diminutive P series has been steadily closing the gap for awhile now. Join us as we find out just how good the P series has become in our full Huawei P10 and P10 Plus review!. In an effort to bring our readers, and viewers, the most comprehensive review experience possible, the Huawei P10 and P10 PlusÂ. were reviewed by two different members of Android Authority. While we are looking at both P10 devices in this review, it should be noted that Joshua Vergara â who compiled the video review above â has primarily been using the P10 Plus as his main device since MWC. Meanwhile, I (Kris Carlon) have been using the regular P10 for the same amount of time, so both of our opinions â and thus, both of the devices â are represented in this review.. The P10 and P10 Plus are pretty reminiscent of their predecessors, the P9 and P9 Plus, albeit with more rounded edges and a relocated fingerprint scanner. But there’s no denying they are also reminiscent of another phone â the iPhone 7 to be exact. Just when we thought Huawei had finally moved beyond its âiPhone cloneâ roots, the company has regressed a little and clearly borrowed inspiration from the iPhone 7 in its latest P series devices. The point doesn’t need laboring, but it’s worth pointing out, if for no other reason than for the fact it slightly tarnishes the originality of what is otherwise a great looking smartphone.. Following the release of the 5.2 inch Huawei P9, Huawei has followed up with a larger 5.5 inch version, the Huawei P9 Plus. Along with a bigger display, the P9 Plus comes with an auto-focus â¦. Huawei is continuing its solid run that started with great smartphones long before the Nexus 6P and the Mate 8. gain international recognition and the launch of the Huawei P9, together â¦. The P10 and P10 Plus, like their forebears, bring a solid metal construction with very impressive build quality. However, this time, there’s a bit more curvature to their smooth sides and corners. Rather than the old chamfered edge on the back, both phones have a slightly rounder edge that curves nicely onto the back of the device.. Both phones are very thin, making them light, manageable and easy to grip while still retaining the thinness the P series has always been known for. All buttons are on the right hand side of the phone, with a nice color accent around the power button that both Josh and I appreciate much more than we probably should. Both phones are also very thin at 7mm, making them light, manageable and easy to grip while still retaining the thinness the P series has always been known for.. Looking at the back of the P10 and P10 Plus we again see the familiar glass âvisorâ from previous P series devices, once again housing a dual Leica camera setup (the specifics of which change depending on which model P10 you’re using) and two-tone LED flash. Below this is where things get interesting, with several new color options made in collaboration with Pantone and even a new texture this time around. While Huawei told us they didn’t design the âhyper diamond-cutâ surface for the sounds it makes, you’ll likely find yourself just as prone to lazily scratching at it with your fingernail as we are. (Note: only available on the Dazzling Blue and Dazzling Gold colors). On the P10 series, Huawei has relocated the fingerprint scanner to the front of the phone, where it can be used in place of on-screen buttons.. The other big design difference on the back of the phone, barring those very iPhone-esque antenna bands at the bottom, is the absence of the fingerprint scanner, which is now found on the front of the phone. The lozenge-shaped sensor, located on a bezel no larger than the P9 series, is of the solid state variety, meaning no physical clicks. Huawei has offered a slight haptic vibration for the scanner though, which you can enable for unlocking the phone or when using the fingerprint scanner for navigation.. Read more: The pros and cons of fingerprint scanner gestures. While on-screen navigation buttons are the default, you can enable fingerprint scanner gestures in the settings. Tapping the scanner takes you back a step, holding it down takes you home, and swiping left or right opens up the recents apps overview. Swiping up from the bezel to the right of the sensor onto the screen itself can also be used to call up Google Assistant .. While these gestures are novel and surprisingly intuitive (Josh had more issues getting used to them than me), they offer a much more limited range of function than traditional on-screen or capacitive buttons, denying you button shortcuts for Nougat’s quick app switching and split-screen mode for example.. You can use a floating dock to have access to both fingerprint gestures and on-screen buttons (meaning quick app switching is possible, even if you’ll still need to enter split-screen mode via the recent apps overview), but it’s an inelegant and rather clumsy solution.. Fingerprint scanner gestures are novel and surprisingly intuitive, but they are limited in functionality. We can only hope navigation gestures weren’t the main reason for relocating the fingerprint scanner to the front of the phone, as both Josh and I only used these navigation gestures for a few days before switching back to the more familiar and full-featured on-screen buttons. While some might be willing to live without some shortcuts to use these fun gestures, the lack of any kind of visual indicators may put off novices just as much as their limited functionality will likely put off more advanced users. They’re also nowhere near as reliable as capacitive or on-screen buttons, sometimes requiring multiple attempts to register a gesture.. The P10 features a 5.1-inch Full HD display while the P10 Plus has a 5.5-inch QHD display with 25 percent greater pixel density. The P10 is the easier device to handle out of the two, with its 5.1-inch screen compared to the P10 Plus’ 5.5-inch diagonal. Both devices use an IPS-NEO LCD under Gorilla Glass 5 although their resolutions differ: the P10 features a Full HD display (1,920 x 1,080 pixels, 431 ppi) while the P10 Plus has a QHD display (2,560 x 1,440 pixels, 534 ppi) with more than 25-percent greater pixel density. It’s worth noting that the P10 Plus has a display mode setting to render text and images larger than might be expected, which reduces the obviousness of its higher resolution screen.. Both IPS screens have great viewing angles and get plenty bright and are easily viewable under broad daylight, with an impressive brightness of close to 600 nits, both according to Huawei’s claims and to Android Authority’s display testing. The colors are easy enough on the eyes, with impressive saturation for LCDs, but by default they do seem to skew more toward the cooler side of the display spectrum. Fortunately, display colors can be modified in the display settings.. The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus both make use of the latest and greatest Kirin 960 chipset from Huawei subsidiary HiSilicon, combined with Mali-G71 MP8 graphics. The octa-core Kirin SoC delivers four high-performance Cortex A73 cores clocked at 2.4GHz and four energy-efficient Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.8GHz for less demanding tasks. Huawei hasn’t been shy about pitching the Kirin 960 as a viable competitor to the best Qualcomm and Samsung have to offer this year and if you’re the type that’s prone to benchmark scores they put it pretty high up the food chain.. As with most contemporary smartphones in their first week of use, the P10 and P10 Plus (which, in our case is the 128GB version equipped with 6GB of RAM rather than the 4GB found in other P10 models) didn’t skip a beat. Both devices were luxuriously lag and stutter free with no app crashes, restarts or any other unexpected behavior.. The base storage on both devices is 64GB and both can be supplemented with microSD expansion. Real-world performance was snappy and reliable and delivered everything you’d expect from a smaller Mate 9. The base storage on both devices is 64GB which is fantastic, and both can be supplemented with microSD expansion if you need a little more.. Both Josh and I put the P10 and P10 Plus through their gaming paces but while Josh went for graphically-intensive games like Jade Empire, I simply spent hours on various planes playing my current go-to, Sky Force Reloaded. While neither of us suffered from any slowdown or lost frames even after hours of gameplay, the higher resolution display on the P10 Plus naturally means it has to work harder because it has to push 25 percent more pixels around.. The P10 family also benefits from the fabled machine learning algorithms introduced on the Mate 9 last year, which guarantee app load times 20 percent faster than normal and a system that will not slow down over time. Like the Mate 9, the P10 will supposedly learn from your usage habits, with its Ultra Memory function compressing the apps you don’t use very often and keeping the ones you do use always at the ready. This is all well and good, but only time will tell the degree of truth to be found in these types of claim.. Audio from the single bottom-firing speaker is capable if unexceptional, although it does get impressively loud without sounding too tinny. For many, a smartphone with front-facing bezels this size really should have come equipped with stereo front-facing speakers, but Huawei unfortunately doesn’t seem in any hurry to replicate the great speaker experience found on the Nexus 6P. The P10 does decently well for what it packs, but don’t buy this phone expecting BoomSound quality audio. Like most phones, things sound much better with headphones plugged in.. As for calls, we used the P10 Plus on the T-Mobile network in the US without any issues regarding call quality or connection speed and reliability. The P10’s âLoud Voiceâ mode helps boost in-call volume for noisy environments, alleviating the need to switch to the speaker just to be able to hear the person on the other end.. The P10 and P10 Plus will be heading to Canadian carriers too , meaning importing one into the US will be a much simpler affair than with previous Huawei devices not officially available via gethuawei.com. They’ll work fine on AT&T and T-Mobile at minimum, but check your carrier bands if you’re thinking of picking one up. All the usual connectivity options are on board: NFC, dual band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and Bluetooth 4.2 LE. The P10 Plus also packs an IR blaster and 4×4 MIMO thanks to its four antennas for up to 600Mbit/s download speeds, both of which the regular P10 lacks.. When it comes to battery life, both the P10 and P10 Plus excelled. In our initial test using our custom Android Authority battery testing app, we projected that the P10 Plus, with its 3,750mAh cell, would get six hours of screen-on time under typical usage. Josh found that even with his heavier usage habits, that included plenty of music playback, Jade Empire and YouTube viewing on top of emails and general messaging, that he was regularly knocking out five hours of screen-on time.. Unlike some previous P series phones, you shouldn't find yourself scrounging around for a charger mid-afternoon.. Even on the P10 with its 3,200mAh battery, our custom battery test predicted just over five and a half hours of screen-on time and I had similarly impressive results to Josh, managing to regularly eke out at least five hours screen-on time thanks to the P10’s lower resolution screen. Unlike some previous P series phones, you shouldn’t find yourself scrounging around for a charger mid-afternoon.. Under the heaviest load, our custom gaming test, made the P10 Plus screen conk out at three and a half hours while the P10 made it to just under four hours. The same pattern emerged with our video playback test, where the P10 Plus managed an impressive nine and a half hours and the P10 knocked it out of the park with over 11 hours. Again, this is due to the smaller lower resolution display, so if the best possible battery life is what you’re after with the P10, you might have to reconsider how badly you want a larger, 2K display.. Fortunately, charging both phones up is a breeze using the included Supercharger brick and cable. Naturally, for best results you should always use the charger that came in the box, with the advantage being a nearly half full battery in a half an hour. However, both Josh and I also used regular Quick Charge 3.0 charging bricks and other USB Type-C cables, though naturally this combination wasnât as fast as Huawei’s preferred solution. That said, neither of us ever felt any anxiety about battery charge levels while using the P10 and P10 Plus. Even with Josh’s higher resolution display, he was comfortably seeing out the day and with the Full HD P10 I had plenty to spare at day’s end.. Huawei’s battery optimizations have been really good for a while and the added benefit of the Supercharger just goes even further towards putting the company near the top of the pile where pound-for-pound battery life is concerned. Of course there’s also the usual bevy of battery saving modes, both from Huawei and those those that come as part and parcel of Android Nougat to help manage your power consumption according to your particular needs and habits.. The camera package is really important for Huawei, as the P series was one of the first smartphone product lines to bring dual lens and sensor camera setups. While things were off to a good start on the P9 last year, with the P10 the dual Leica cameras feel like a further improvement to the system. (Note: the images embedded here are all from the P10, but there’s a gallery of shots from the P10 Plus is at the end of the camera section).. It wonât come as a surprise to know that Huaweiâs latest camera offering is really good.. On the P10 you’ll get a regular 12MP Summarit-H lens at f/2.2 aperture, backed up by a 20MP monochrome sensor that does the work of getting depth and detail information before color is inserted into the scene. The P10 Plus gets a bump to Summilux-H lenses at f/1.8 aperture for even better low light performance and shallow depth of field photography. As you may have seen, DxOMark gave very high scores to the P10 camera recently, so it probably wonât come as much of a surprise to know that we also found Huaweiâs latest camera offering to be really good.. First off, however, we should talk about that front-facing camera, which has now received the Leica treatment as well. An 8MP f/1.9 aperture shooter helps to get good lower light shots and is backed up by an almost uncomfortably powerful selfie mode that provides a lot of control over how your face ends up looking in the picture. This is called the âPerfect Selfieâ mode and it requires you to look in a few different directions so that it can take control of areas like the subjectâs eyes and jawline, among other settings.. You can see in the P10 Plus image gallery at the bottom of this section just how strong the results can be skewed, with an original selfie of Josh followed by others with the selfie settings ramped up to 5 and then 10 (see just below). Meanwhile, if you caught my âbeauty modeâ selfie efforts from MWC, where I pushed all settings to their limit just to see what would happen, you’ll get a good idea of just how ridiculous too much power can be when put in the wrong hands.. On the positive side, both the P10 and P10 Plus benefit from an adaptive selfie mode that recognizes multiple subjects and automatically switches to a wide angle mode to squeeze everyone in. If the selfie-focused nova and nova plus didn’t give it away, Huawei is really obsessed with selfies right now. Like, probably even more obsessed than selfie fans are. Fortunately, if you’re prone to taking photos of yourself, you’re going to run out of interest in tweaking things before the P10 and P10 Plus run out of selfie options and settings.. The bokeh effect on the front-facing camera is laughably bad at times. You can even get a similar fake bokeh effect from the front-facing camera that you can get from the primary camera’s wide aperture mode. The f/1.9 aperture on the fixed focus front-facing camera is already capable of blurring the background to a degree, but you can also enable âArtistic Effectâ when in Portrait Mode to push things even further. While this sounds great in theory â softening up the background and further drawing attention to the subject’s face â the actual implementation is pretty spotty. In fact, it’s laughably bad a lot of the time, with bizarre out-of-focus halos enveloping the subject’s head or oddly in-focus patches of the background, as you can see above Lanh’s head and around mine and Nicole’s.. Which brings us to the much more well-equipped main camera and its capabilities. Portrait mode also comes on the main camera, with the same selfie and artistic features, but there is plenty more available at oneâs disposal. Aperture settings can be set to pull the foreground away from everything behind it â getting as low as f/0.95 aperture, which is impressive on paper but it still can’t fully emulate the look of a real lens with the same aperture.. Enabling the P10’s wide aperture mode is useful to change the point of focus after a picture is taken, but again, the idea works better than the implementation more often than than not. Post-shot refocusing is a cool idea but it has very rarely been pulled off successfully. That said, when the P10 gets it right, it can produce some very nice results. Just don’t count on getting those every time.. As far as settings and options go, the P10 is almost comically well equipped. As with the Mate 9, the Huawei camera app takes a lot of getting used to, with multiple menus and settings to be found with a swipe in any direction. There’s a whole swathe of pre-loaded modes including a dedicated monochrome mode we highly recommend getting to know your way around, as well as other familiar fare like HDR, panorama, light shot, light painting, time lapse, slow motion, and so on, as well as additional downloadable modes for better food photos and more.. As far as settings and options go, the P10 is almost comically well equipped but the camera app takes a lot of getting used to.. The P10 can shoot 20MP and 12MP shots at 4:3 ratio with the highest resolution 16:9 shots available at 9MP. Of course, you can always just crop larger resolution images to whatever aspect ratio you prefer and RAW shooting is supported for tweaking your photos in post. Both photos and video can make use of standard, vivid or smooth colors, beauty mode and there’s a range of pre-loaded live preview filters too.. Video modes include 4K and 1080p 60fps recording, which are all good to see. The resulting videos look quite good and donât overtly lack in any aspect; however, object tracking and the enhanced stabilization get turned off in 4K and 60fps Full HD recording modes. While OIS is available for usage no matter what, the 1080p videos end up looking smoother as a result of this setting.. It would be an effort in futility to try to do justice to all the features of the P10 camera in this review, but suffice it to say that if you can learn your way around the camera app and pick up on the little quirks of the camera, there is quite a bit of good to be found with the P10 and P10 Plus. For example, HDR, which you need to choose from the camera modes screen rather than enjoy it as an automatic setting.. Related: The best Android smartphone cameras. Even so, HDR is not a âone size fits allâ mode either. get the proper level of bump in highlights and shadows you’ll need toÂ. skew the exposure toward the blown out areas yourself. In this example, you’ll have to first lock the focus on the foreground subject and then drag the metering ringÂ. to a blown out area to make best use of the P10’s exposure compensation. this was only discovered through fiddling around with different exposure points first.. We always like to see manual controls built into camera apps, and that is exactly what you get with the P10. All of the controls you’ll need are available just a short swipe up from the shutter button, providing control of the ISO, exposure compensation, shutter speed, white balance, metering and focus mode. As mentioned above, photos can be captured in raw DNG format, which is nice for any seasoned photographers who want to pull more from their scenes in post-production or for those wanting to learn the basics on their phone before investing in a pricey DSLR.. ISO performance isnât too bad, with the upper ceiling at ISO 3200 still providing usable photos without too much loss of detail. Thankfully, shutter speeds can be changed up to a great extent so you can still can get crisp long exposure shots as long as the phone is completely stabilized for the extended shutter time. Like most smartphones though, the P10 generally struggles a little in low light situations, with plenty of visible noise when you go looking for it. But the P10 covers up its flaws better than a lotÂ. smartphone cameras, producing solid images that only start to fall apart under 100 percent crops. To put it bluntly, you won’t get effortlessly good photos as reliably as you would with the Pixel , for example, but with a little effort and know-how you can get nearly as good images most of the time.. Overall, the pictures from the P10 prove that the dual camera lens and sensor combo works. Not to mention the fact that monochromatic photos look absolutely fantastic because the 20MP sensor is dedicated to it. Indeed, B&W photos are one of the biggest strengths of the P10 camera for obvious reasons and you might surprise yourself by just how into them you get when once you get a taste of how impressive the results are.. The level of detail, inside and out, make this camera one of the more memorable performers so far this year.. Photos generally have a good level of sharpness and the various color modes can instantly change the output to more vibrant or more subdued palettes depending on the effect you’re after (as you can see in the balcony shots above). But itâs really the level of detail, inside and out, that makes this camera one of the more memorable performers so far this year â it might not have the saturation or constant HDR+ rendering of Galaxy and Pixel phones, but with the proper attention to detail and to the different capabilities of the camera software, there is plenty to like about the shooting experience on the P10. If you’re willing to put in the time you’ll almost definitely be able to get the results you want.. And finally, EMUI â the Huawei Android iteration that has seen quite a few changes in the last few generations , most recently adding an option for an app drawer. With the P10, EMUI still has an impressively large number of customization features that make it one of the most robust versions of Nougat that weâve seen thus far. Unfortunately, there is still a lot of needless app duplication going on.. Out of the box, you’ll get the P10 without an app drawer, but this can be easily added in the settings right off the bat. But that’s just the start of EMUI’s customization potential. As far as the display is concerned, there’s a blue light filter for those late night mobile sessions, complete with scheduled start and stop times, and a color wheel for adjusting the P10 display’s temperature to your liking.. As mentioned above, you can choose between traditional on-screen buttons or fingerprint scanner gestures for navigation. But there’s also a floating navigation bubble that can replace on-screen buttons or supplement the scanner gestures. If you prefer on-screen buttons, you can also rearrange their order to your liking, including adding an additional button for pulling the notification shade down without having to reach up to the top of the screen.. There’s an app lock for securing sensitive apps with a fingerprint and a âsafeâ for your file manager that can be locked down in the same way. You can fully manage how much of your notifications appear on the lock screen, add or remove a step counter and signature and subscribe to various lock screen galleries including Leica photography that refresh every time you turn on your phone’s lock screen. Huawei’s silly knuckle gestures are also on board for quickly launching apps and taking a screenshot but you’d be forgiven for never using them.. also a bunch of battery saving settings including Nougat’s Doze on the Go, Do Not Disturb, app twin (for multiple simultaneous WhatsApp or Facebook logins), granular app permissions and a lot more that would be familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of Huawei’s EMUI or Android Nougat’s feature set. Huawei’s settings menu is nicely laid out and clean, with most major features accessible with just a couple of taps. The notification shade follows the black-and-blue look introduced on the Mate 9 and offers customizable quick settings tiles as well as Direct Replies and bundled notifications.. Specifically, the P10 and P10 Plus are running Huawei’s EMUI 5.1, an updated version of the EMUI 5 interface that first appeared on the Mate 9. For a more complete walkthrough of EMUI, head to EMUI 5 review here .. All of these functions (and many more) lie just beneath the surface of an updated interface that is more easy on the eye than perhaps any EMUI before it. The addition of the app drawer is a must for most Android enthusiasts and Huawei offers more customization options than most manufacturers, with the vast majority actually being useful.. The addition of the app drawer is a must for most Android enthusiasts and Huawei offers more customization options than most manufacturers.. We really wish Huawei would add a built-in icon pack manager or switch up those dated icons, but we have to give credit where credit is due. EMUI has come a long way in recent years and is now very far from the ugly clumsy beast it once was. But, like the camera app, you’re only going to get the most out of it if you go digging around..

For further market details, see our roundup of Huawei P10 pricing and availability .. The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus are not perfect, but they are about as close as it is possible to get right now. They offer almost all the benefits of the larger Mate 9 flagship but in smaller, more manageable form factors. To put this is in perspective, most smartphones in the 5.1-inch range don’t have half the features of the regular P10, and the P10 Plus can comfortably hold its own against any of the 5.5-inch flagships around right now, even if some might argue it’s a little overpriced.. The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus offer almost all the benefits of the larger Mate 9 flagship but in smaller, more manageable form factors.. The improved dual Leica cameras on both phones are the major standout, offering exceptional quality for those willing to put in the effort to learn the intricacies of the camera app. Software is solid, with plenty of customization options and built-in features, display quality is great, build quality is impeccable and the battery life on both devices are seriously good. But there’s nothing life changing or earth-shattering going on here. Just incremental improvements that really stack up.. On the down side, audio is a bit of a let down and the complexity of the camera app will provide a barrier to a lot of users. The P10 is perfectly capable of getting great shots, but achieving those results sometimes requires a lot more effort than other exceptional shooters like the Google Pixel. The same goes for the software; while EMUI 5.1 is a huge improvement (barring the needless duplication of stock apps), you’re only going to get the most out of the P10’s software if you really commit to diving in and exploring.. There's nothing life changing or earth-shattering going on here; just incremental improvements that really stack up.. That said, the P10 and P10 Plus may not be the perfect âaverage consumerâ phone, requiring a longer acquaintance period than some of their competitors to get the most out of them. But for enthusiasts, especially of the photographic variety, there’s a lot to like here. Unfortunately, their lack of official availability in the American market will limit their popularity to only the dedicated few. But for those that do decide to pick up a P10 or P10 Plus, you’re very unlikely to be disappointed.. What are your thoughts on the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus?

Huawei P10 vs P10 Plus: Is the Plus worth the extra cash?. Huawei has taken the wraps off of the much-hyped Huawei P10 and P10 Plus, two flagship devices with a lot to offer. When it comes to standard and “plus”-sized phones, however, many manufacturers choose to build two devices where the size is the only difference. That’s not true of the P10 and P10 Plus — instead, there are a few more differences to speak of. If you’re thinking of buying either the P10 or P10 Plus, there are a number of things you should consider before you make your purchase. Thankfully, we’ve put together this guide outlining the major differences between the two.. 145.9 x 69.3 x 7 millimeters (5.72 x 2.73 x 0.28 inches). 153.5 x 74.2 x 7 millimeters (6.04 x 2.92 x 0.28 inches). Silver, Rose Gold, Black, Gold, Blue, Green. Silver, Rose Gold, Black, Gold, Blue, Green. manufacturers now build a standard and “plus” handset with identical specs. That’s clearly not true of the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus, however. Let’s get something out of the way right now: The Huawei P10 Plus is the better device. The question is, how much better is it?. For starters, the two phones feature the same processor — the HiSilicon Kirin 960 — which is actually a decent chip. the chip performs a little better or a little worse than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 , depending on the benchmark in question. In other words, it’s about on par with Qualcomm ‘s 2016 flagship, but. latest chip, the Snapdragon 835 .. When it comes to storage and RAM, the difference is more stark. While the standard P10 comes with 4GB and RAM and either 32 or 64GB of storage, the P10 Plus comes in two variants, one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage and another with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. P10 Plus is on par with the. Both devices offer a MicroSD card slot, however, so if. you don’t want to shell out cash for the models with more storage, you can just make use of the MicroSD card slot.. These two phones are both powerful, but the Huawei P10 Plus is obviously the better device here.. Plus are almost identical in terms of design. — the only difference is their size. The design of the phones is actually quite nice, too. features a unibody look that’s typical of most modern smartphones,. they also offer a more comprehensive camera module. been developed in partnership with Leica , which is easy to tell if you glance at the. branding right next to the cameras. You’ll also find a basic Huawei logo on the back of the phone.. Here, you’ll find a home button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor, as well. As previously mentioned, however, the phones differ in. size, but only when it comes to. Both phones are 7-millimeters thin, and it’s great that Huawei has. managed to keep the bulk down on the larger device. 145.9 x 69.3 millimeters, while the larger device sits at 153.5 x 74.2 millimeters. The P10 Plus is heavier, though, and weighs an additional 0.71 ounces.. In the design department, this is a tie.. Instead of opting for the same display, Huawei outfitted the. P10 Plus with a better alternative. While the standard P10 has a decent LCD screen in its own right — which sits at 5.1-inches and touts 1,920 x 1,080-pixel resolution — the P10 Plus includes a 5.5-inch screen with 2,560 x 1,440-pixel resolution. Although the P10 Plus’ LCD panel is larger, the higher resolution is enough to push it above and beyond the P10’s pixel density. The P10 comes in at 431 pixels per inch, while the P10 Plus sits at 534.. While most people won’t be able to notice the difference, others will, especially those interested in using the device for. Both feature Huawei’s proprietary SuperCharge technology, which. could come in handy in a pinch. We don’t know exactly how long the handsets will last on a single charge just yet, and, sadly, neither of the phones have wireless charging, which is a bit of a bummer.. On paper, it looks like the Huawei P10 Plus has better battery life, but in real-world use, this. 3,200mAh battery, while the P10 Plus offers a 3,750mAh battery. You may also recall, however, that the P10 Plus also has a higher-resolution screen, which will eat up a lot more battery than the display on the P10. So, they may actually end up lasting around the same amount of time as one. When it comes down to it, however, we’ll have to wait until we can perform more tests to determine a winner in the battery department.. Huawei has gone all in for the cameras on the P10 and P10 Plus, and it has worked with renowned camera maker Leica on the. That’s good news for those wanting a device with a top-tier camera. While at first glance you might assume that the cameras are the same on both phones, this isn’t. In the P10, you’ll find dual Summarit lenses, one of which is a. 20-megapixel monochrome sensor and the other a 12-megapixel color camera. The two cameras work in conjunction to create more detailed and in-depth shots, which is certainly welcome.. While the sensors in the P10 Plus are the same type and feature. the same megapixel count, they’re Leica Summilux sensors, which should. Moreover, unlike the f/2.2 aperture in the Huawei P10, the camera in the P10 Plus offers a f/1.8 aperture.. partnership with Leica extends beyond the rear-facing camera. phones is also built by Leica.. sensors in the P10 Plus are slightly better, this.

Huawei P10 and P10 Plus review. With dual lenses and a heap of features, Huawei’s P10 is the photographer’s phone. The Huawei P10 camera experience is so stellar its photos will convince your friends you're a pro.. The Huawei P10 camera experience is so stellar its photos will convince your friends you're a pro.. The Huawei P10 camera experience is so stellar its photos will convince your friends you're a pro.. Not officially sold in the U.S.. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. in terms of the attention it will get, the. Huawei P10 is likely to play second fiddle to the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy S8, the next iPhone, and Google’s new Pixel phones. This is a crime, because both the P10 and P10 Plus are phones that should put Huawei on everyone’s radar.. While both devices have it all, though, how do they stack up in the real world? We’ve been using them over the past few weeks to see.. The P10 and P10 Plus offer a mesmerizing camera experience that will leave your friends thinking you’re a pro. They also offer uncompromising performance and stellar battery life, all in attractive, colorful frames. It’s a shame importing one to the U.S. Huawei hasn’t stepped too far away from the design it introduced with the P9 , an already deliciously attractive phone. The fingerprint sensor has been moved to the front of the phone, below the screen, into what Huawei describes as a seamless sensor. It’s still recessed to make finding it easy in the dark, but otherwise the glass over the top is all one piece.. The glass over the rear cameras is broken only by the dual-flash unit, and blends in perfectly with the aluminum body. The antenna bands are wrapped around the glass panel at the top, and curved around the bottom of the body, so they’re barely noticeable. Huawei also paints them in a contrasting color to the phone itself, obscuring them even further.. Color plays a big part in differentiating the P10 from other Huawei phones, and those from other manufacturers too. Black, white, and gold are all available, but it’s the special blue and green models that really catch the eye. These have been developed in partnership with color experts Pantone. Green may be 2017’s color of the year, but it’ll split opinion on the P10, with some loving it and others disliking its soft grassy hue. We prefer “dazzling blue,” which offers a textured, reflective rear that seems to change the phone’s shape in certain light.. As usual, parallels can be drawn between the P10’s shape and the iPhone, right down to the way the body curves and the speaker grill placement; but there are some attractive stylistic touches that make it different. We love the red flash of color around the sleep/wake key and its textured surface to make it easy to find, for example.. Both phones are lightweight, and the P10 especially is easy to hold due to its compact size and 6.9mm thickness. If you don’t like big phones, then you’ll love the P10.. What the P10 doesn’t do is break any new design ground. It’s very much an enhanced P9, and is extremely reminiscent of the iPhone 6S. We wouldn’t call this a reason not to buy it, but it’s definitely one of the reasons you may overlook the phone. Huawei needs to draw your eye away from great looking new phones like the LG G6 and the Galaxy S8, and the P10 may not cut it.. The Huawei P10 has a 5.1-inch IPS LCD screen with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution. The P10 Plus is the bigger of the two, with a 5.5-inch IPS LCD, and a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. The pixel-per-inch ratio of each, respectively, is 432 and 534ppi.. Color plays a big part in differentiating the P10. The P10 Plus’ screen is a beauty, and it’s a shame the same resolution hasn’t been used on the smaller P10. Under normal circumstances you won’t notice a huge difference, and looking at the P10’s display isn’t like staring into a muddy puddle; but the extra pixels let you see so much more detail when looking at photos. The brightness can also be cranked up without ruining the look of any content or images, making its outdoor performance exceptional.. What the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus don’t have is an oleophobic coating over the screen. This invisible layer prevents the buildup of fingerprints and smudges, and has been standard on most phones — regardless of price — for several years. Omitting it from the P10 is unfortunate, and one that Huawei excuses by fitting a standard screen protector to the phone. Sadly, this is just as smudgy and ugly as the screen will get without it fitted at all. If you buy the P10, you may want to invest in a better screen protector.. Huawei made great strides forward with its own user interface it places over Android 7.0 Nougat when it released the Mate 9. EMUI 5.0 moved away from the extreme customization we were used to, and closer to the standard look and crucially, the feel of stock Android. No, it wasn’t Android as seen on the Pixel phones, but it was inching closer. For the P10, Huawei has introduced EMUI 5.1, which incorporates all the power saving, performance enhancing, lifetime-lengthening tweaks, then adds a few more for good measure.. Most of the changes are ones we’ll never actively see, because they work behind the scenes, but there are a few which impact daily use. For example, the Huawei has seen fit to replace Android’s on-screen navigation buttons with the multifunction fingerprint sensor.. A quick press goes back a screen, a long press takes you back to the home screen, and a slide to the left or right opens up the recent apps screen. There’s genuinely no reason for this feature to exist. It’s not more intuitive, it’s not faster, and it doesn’t do anything better than the old, button-based system. It’s not worse — except when it doesn’t react quick enough — but using it takes some getting used to, and for seemingly no real benefit. The only thing it does is slightly de-clutter the on-screen interface. Thankfully, Huawei gives you the chance to use the regular on-screen Android buttons, which makes us wonder if it was really worth the time and effort to introduce an alternative that even it can’t wholeheartedly commit to.. The Android operating system came with a February 1 security patch installed, and both phones have had software updates during our review time. Huawei isn’t always the quickest to update Android to a new version, but don’t let this put you off the phone though. The company has dramatically improved its software recently, and it’s a pleasure to use.. The P9 introduced us to the joy of a Leica co-branded camera on a smartphone, a feature refined for the Mate 9, and then refined again for the P10 and P10 Plus. There’s little to separate the two in terms of technology. The cameras have a 12-megapixel color sensor and a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor, but the lenses and aperture differ depending on the phone. The P10 has a pair of Leica Summarit-H lenses and an f/2.2 aperture, while the P10 Plus has Summilux-H lenses and a larger f/1.8 aperture. What does this mean? The P10 Plus should take better pictures in lower light.. If you’re a photo-freak, or a budding one, the P10 is the smartphone for you. Testing the two cameras back-to-back did show the P10 Plus as the better low-light performer, but the differences are minimal, particularly because the P10 is so good. Shooting across a river at night, with bridge and building lights illuminating the scene, the P10 Plus showed more detail in the sky, and in other shots, the color of buildings had a more realistic tone. It’s important to stress the difference is marginal, and the photos taken with the P10 are still excellent.. The two camera lenses add two special features to the P10 models. The first being the chance to take pictures in pure monochrome, and the other to produce the blurred background bokeh effect. We adore monochrome mode on the P10. It has the power to add atmosphere to otherwise mundane pictures, or produce gorgeous portrait pictures. This is a major feature of the P10, and the front and rear cameras detect faces, adjust the image according to light sources, and add special effects to improve the image.. We tested it extensively with the help of a professional photographer, and you can read about his tips here , and see the results of the training session. We think they’re great, and are genuinely impressed with the P10’s ability to take amazing pictures of people. It made us want to take, and perhaps more importantly, share more selfies. That’s real evidence of how happy we were with the results.. Equally as impressive is the bokeh mode, which is easy to use, and simple to adjust after the photo has been taken. Zoom in on the final image and you can see where the software blurs edges it shouldn’t, but it’s minimal and not noticeable at all under normal circumstances.. Leica has also assisted with the camera software, and the P10 has one of the best camera user interfaces on a smartphone we’ve ever seen. Swipe left or right to access clear, concise menus, tap obvious buttons to change settings, and swipe up the screen to enter into a comprehensive manual mode.. Beautiful pictures, an atmospheric monochrome mode, brilliant bokeh, and a great camera app. If you’re a photo-freak, or a budding one, the P10 is the smartphone for you. It’s so good, the shots you take will make people think you’re a pro.. Both phones use the Kirin 960 octa-core processor, the same as the Mate 9. The P10 has 4GB of memory. The P10 Plus differs — if you buy a version with 64GB of internal memory, it’ll have 4GB of RAM, but the 128GB models have 6GB of RAM.. Huawei has dramatically improved its software recently, and it’s a pleasure to use. The P10 Plus with 6GB of RAM returned an AnTuTu 3D benchmark score of 138311, while the P10 with 4GB of RAM oddly scored 142884. Contrast that against the LG G6’s score of 135,032, you’ll find the both the P10 and P10 Plus to offer more than competitive performance against current flagships.. We had no issues with performance on either phone. All games we tried worked perfectly, the phone never got too hot, and we didn’t have any slowdown due to many apps being open.. The P10 has a 3,200mAh battery inside, and the P10 Plus has a 3,750mAh cell. Because of the screen size and resolution differences between the two, there’s little benefit left on the P10 Plus, and the two are comparable in terms of use and standby time. The P10 Plus accompanied us to Baselworld 2017, a four day event where the phone dealt with email, social networking, video recording, photos, calendar use, music, and a whole lot more. It usually finished a full day — 7 a.m. to midnight, approximately — with around 15 percent remaining. That’s a solid result, and it easily beat the iPhone 7 Plus along for the ride.. Huawei’s Supercharge fast charging system needs the included charger and USB Type-C cable to be used, and it charges up both phones in about 90 minutes from zero. You can gets at least 60 percent in a third of that time, and that’s a major benefit.. Let’s get this out of the way first. Huawei hasn’t announced the P10 or P10 Plus for the United States, and it’s a massive shame. The good news is they both have wide 4G LTE support, and should happily connect to T-Mobile and AT&T’s GSM networks, so importing a European one is a possible option.. Huawei provides the price in euros. The P10 starts at 650 euros, and the P10 Plus at 700 euros. That’s about $700 for the P10 and $750 for the P10 Plus, based on currency rates at the time of writing. Huawei has signed deals with all four major U.K. networks to sell the P10, where it’s available with a low initial cost on a contract. Working on a $700 cost for the P10, it’s squarely in-between the LG G6. and the Samsung Galaxy S8 .. Because the P10 isn’t officially available in the U.S., we’ll talk about the U.K. The phone is covered for two years, and the battery and charger for six months. Normal wear and tear isn’t covered, and nor is water damage, or if it goes wrong because you took it apart. To claim under the warranty, you’ll need to visit a Huawei service center or send it back to Huawei.. A photographer’s dream smartphone, the Huawei P10 takes astonishing pictures that’ll make your friends think you’re a pro. Go for the P10 if you prefer a compact phone, and the P10 Plus will satisfy big-screen lovers.. There are two alternatives to the Huawei P10 worth considering. is similarly priced to the P10, and the Google Pixel XL. costs around the same as the Huawei P10 Plus. They come with stock Android 7.1.2 Nougat installed, and will receive more regular updates. The camera is also superb, but doesn’t have a monochrome mode.. has a dual-lens camera for incredible wide-angle shots, and a wide-angle selfie camera. The screen is also larger, with an unusual 18:9 ratio that means the body is very compact. We love both it and the Pixel. We haven’t tested the new Galaxy S8. extensively yet, and although it’s more expensive than the Huawei P10 and doesn’t have the same specification camera, is sure to be an excellent phone.. The final alternative to consider is the Huawei Mate 9. It’s bigger than the P10 and P10 Plus, but it offers a similar camera experience, plus it’s actually for sale in the United States for a reasonable $600 unlocked without a contract.. Huawei hasn’t added water resistance to the P10, putting it a step behind the LG G6, the Samsung Galaxy S8, and the Apple iPhone 7. The body is made from metal and glass, therefore providing only the basic durability in the event of a fall. Wrap the P10 in a case, if you buy one.. Software updates have always been sporadic for Huawei, and major Android version changes often lag well behind Google’s phones, and even other manufacturers like Samsung and LG. The only way to ensure timely updates is to buy a Pixel phone.. The phone has masses of power, excellent camera capabilities, and a large battery, which means it will likely keep chugging along past two years. It’s going to be a smudge-ridden mess a lot of the time though, unless you pay out for a decent screen protector.. Yes, if Huawei is selling the P10 and P10 Plus in your country, you should. Importing the phones to the U.S. is a different story as it may ramp up the cost of the phone — you may want to look at some of the alternatives mentioned above.. The P10 has a versatile, and creatively exciting camera. It’s also fast, responsive, has good battery life, and is attractive in an unsurprising way. Poor water-resistance and the lack of an oleophobic coating is frustrating, but it’s not a deal-breaker.. If Huawei gets the phone on sale in the U.S., we think it’s an excellent choice, especially if you’re into photography.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

The dazzling blue (or gold) is the best looking metal finish on smartphones I have ever seen. 2k display means it's good for VR, and the CPU is much better than the p9 as this one won't heat up a lot even when filming 4k for a long period of time. The 4k uses h.265 decode method so the file is much smaller sized than other 4k videos. 6 gigs of ram is still very large for a smartphone today, so you are going to be surprised of how multitasking can work on a smartphone. The UI is smooth and fluid, animations are less buggy and glitchy than the last one all across the board, surely this is a phone that competes with Samsung and Apple.. Rated 5 out of. Bought this phone as an upgrade from an iPhone, brilliant decision but I would advise against using the case that comes with the phone. Scratched my phone to bits in the case :'(. Rated 5 out of. Bought it around May and it works just as well as I bought it. Amazingly fast fingerprint scanner, fast processor, good quality camera, just buy it.. Rated 5 out of. Had an upgrade and got the p10 plus love it had it a few weeks now and really impressed big enough to watch tv on and really love the look of it Hubby had my old p9 both have a step counter on Hubby walking loads more now my p10 one is glitchy but mostly works fine I definitely recommend.

Huawei P10 Plus - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 29 30 ». Anonymous, 17 Feb 2018 Standby drain on p10 and p10 plus is absolutely terrible. P10 loses 50% battery over 1.5 days ... more That's impossible unless you have a completely defective unit. I get 2% battery drain overnight with WiFi on. If WiFi is off, it's a 1% drain. I get through an entire day with ease, at least 60% left by 6pm after being off charge from 7am. Then I basically have to fight the phone to drain the battery to critical and that happens about 11pm with music, heavy gaming and alot of web browsing. Please check your phone to see the multitude of apps you have running in the background draining your battery. This is a great phone and the battery life is amazing.. barata, 25 Jan 2018 Got this phone instead of Google Pixel XL, big mistake! Don't get me wrong, camera is fine spe... more If you had a chance to buy a Pixel why did you opt for this equipment? If you want fast updates and pure Android you should have bought Pixel. Even Samsung is messed up on updates and their equipment is more expensive than the Huawei.. Anonymous, 17 Feb 2018 Standby drain on p10 and p10 plus is absolutely terrible. P10 loses 50% battery over 1.5 days ... more You can paste the numbers. Click on 3 dots on the right im the dialer. co2h2co3, 13 Feb 2018 why mine is September security patch..?. There are builds 211 and 212 with January security patches but only able to get patch 211. Have to use Firmware finder to get those. Not sure why ota updates just suddenly stopped on my device.. co2h2co3, 13 Feb 2018 omg...5min drop 1%-2% battery...is this normal? Standby drain on p10 and p10 plus is absolutely terrible. P10 loses 50% battery over 1.5 days with no use, p10 plus is marginally better but still loses 40% battery over 1.5 days with no use. Have no idea what these phones are doing in the background to drain the battery so fast. One app draining battery on the p10 is trip advisor (not draining battery on p10 plus though), an app that I have never opened on either device. Both devices are brand new by the way. I have a Sony xa1 on test also which has only lost 30% over 3.5 days with no use. Huawei make some very good phones which unfortunately have some pretty annoying flaws, just a question of whether you can live with the flaws in your own personal situation. One example is that you can't paste a number into the dialer without first entering a digit, which you then have to go back and delete after pasting. This has been present since at least p8 but still not fixed with p10 or p10 plus. P10 plus is almost a great phone if it weren't for the standby drain issue, not sure it's worth the £450 that's being asked for it in the UK right now. Maybe if it drops to around £300 it'd be a great buy.. co2h2co3, 13 Feb 2018 omg...5min drop 1%-2% battery...is this normal? One must know the way the reader understands. If, you are using the Phone, of course your battery drops. I if its in your pockets streaming musics, of course the battery drops. But if you are not using the phone at all I mean in standby and that power drops has been noticed, it means you have a defective unit.. omg...5min drop 1%-2% battery...is this normal?. Anonymous, 11 Feb 2018 Does anyone have Oreo yet on this phone? I'm still on build B172 with November security patch. why mine is September security patch..?. barata, 25 Jan 2018 Got this phone instead of Google Pixel XL, big mistake! Don't get me wrong, camera is fine spe... more Why so eager to update?!. If u want updates get an Iphone and good luck.. Does anyone have Oreo yet on this phone? I'm still on build B172 with November security patch.. Any one knows if it Dual active SIM or not? is the two sims dual active or dual standby. I have this phone for a month now, and it's awesome. Very fast, no lag at all, the fingerprint scanner is also very very fast and reliable. Battery life is also very good, it lasts a whole day. Camera is also stunning, both the front and the back. About the cons, sometimes it heats up for no big reason, im not doing anything too intensive, im just scrolling through instagram or watching youtube videos and it heats up. Anyone else has this heating issues?. Keke, 13 Jan 2018 A few months after I bought my P10 plus the rear camera went blurry. more maybe of the bokeh mode?. maybe u accidentally touched the bokeh mode. Robert Lewandowski, 02 Feb 2018 i just bought this phone last week and it is brilliant thus far....why are there so much negat... more Sometimes, it is really hard to accept the reality so I cannot blame them.. Hi, I got a P10 plus L09 version. Is it possible to convert the L09 model to dual sim L29 model?. i just bought this phone last week and it is brilliant thus far....why are there so much negative comments though?. The p10 plus has a powersaving utility whereby you can lower the display resolution. Would the lowering of the display to HD affect benchmark results? Or am I misunderstanding what the function does? The mate 9 has the same guts but has more power because of its single HD display, thus less effort for the cpu. barata, 25 Jan 2018 Got this phone instead of Google Pixel XL, big mistake! Don't get me wrong, camera is fine spe... So your telecom operator may not allowed the update to roll in your region. Please not that my P10 plus is running B171. Eddypro, 26 Jan 2018 It is expected for a phone with so much performance to drain the battery some say people battery drain fast?? nope you are not alone try download DU battery Saver cracked and Hi Security Patched from apkmb.com then your long battery life never drain cause by hidden too many apps eat battery.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. by Stephen Schenck. Android - Android + Huawei - Huawei +. 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. Introduction Scandal's a funny thing for smartphones. Sometimes a phone bounces right off a controversy without batting an eye – just look at how all the antennagates and bendgates failed to derail iPhone sales. Other times the impact is much more substantial, and it didn't take very long last year for us to go right from the first reports of Galaxy Note 7 battery issues to the phone being recalled en masse and ultimately scrapped. Huawei launched its spring flagships back at Mobile World Congress in February, introducing the duo of the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus. Initially, we put the smaller P10 through our review process, and found it to be a solid handset that improved in a few ways over the P9 (which we already liked) – it wasn't any great revelation of a smartphone, but its incremental upgrades didn't disappoint us, either. But in the weeks since reviewing the P10, we've been following reports concerning the components Huawei uses to build the phone, and it's come to light that not every P10 (and in the same light, P10 Plus) is built with the same top-quality parts. You might get a phone with speedy LPDDR4 RAM and UFS storage, or you might get stuck with slower LPDDR3 and eMMC 5.1 chips. Huawei's tried to downplay the severity of the situation, claiming that the ultimate impact on phone performance is minimal, and arguing that its actions were necessary to avoid P10 shortages. That very well may be true, but now we find ourselves forced to put these phones under the microscope, looking much more closely into just what hardware shoppers are getting for their phone-buying dollar. For a few weeks now, we've been carrying around the P10's big brother, the P10 Plus. With a bigger, higher-res screen , changes to its dual-camera system, and higher-end memory and storage options, the P10 Plus should be a real upgrade over its smaller sibling. Are all those enhancements worth the additional price of entry? And does the recent scandal over memory and storage taint those upgrades? Let's take a look. In the box: Huawei P10 Plus Huawei SuperCharge adapter USB Type-C to standard-A cable Earbuds Clear case SIM tool Quick-start guide Design Super-sizes the P10 without feeling like a “big” phone in the process It's not difficult to understand the planning that went into making the Huawei P10 Plus look like the phone it is; we wouldn't even be oversimplifying things to describe the handset as “the P10, but bigger.” If that were the beginning and end of it, this wouldn't make for a very interesting review, but there are some salient points to be made about how Huawei grew out the P10 for the P10 Plus, and how that extra space goes to use. Somewhat surprisingly, despite being half a centimeter wider than the P10, and a little under a centimeter taller, the P10 Plus is exactly the same thickness as its sibling: 6.98mm. Just like the P10, the P10 Plus features a rounded-edge metal body with a decently thin profile. While the design itself doesn't feature much in the way of unusual or noteworthy elements, it's also one that's more than a little bit of an iPhone clone – and that's maybe most blatant when it comes to the curved antenna stripe at the bottom of the handset's back. The phone's left edge is mostly unadorned, concealing only the P10 Plus's SIM tray. The bottom is probably the busiest side, with the phone's headphone jack, USB Type-C port, and main speaker. Along the right we find the power button and volume rocker, and up top there's an IR emitter – which we'll talk about more later. Like the regular P10, Huawei gives the power button on the P10 Plus a nice, but still very subtle color accent, anodizing the metal button with a sliver of a red beveled edge. It's just a little touch, but one that adds a bit more class to an otherwise plain-looking design. Around back, the P10 Plus shows off its dual Leica-branded cameras – and maybe most impressively, squeezes those in without any external camera bump. The handset's rear is also its spot to showcase the phone's color, and like the P10, the P10 Plus is available in a nice mix of options. There is one fewer selection available than on the smaller phone, with no “Prestige” gold option for the P10 Plus – just the “Dazzling” gold you see here. While many of those choices are just about the phone's color, a select few also deliver an additional texture to the phone's rear surface. Like the blue P10 we looked at before, this gold handset is covered by an intricate micro-array of tiny grooves, catching the light and giving the phone a unique feel in your hand. We love the look, though we can't help but wonder if it will end up trapping dirt over time, and just how durable it might be – it wouldn't take more than a few scratches for that beautiful pattern to start looking real ragged. The size of the P10 Plus isn't bad for a handset with a 5.5-inch screen – or at least it wouldn't have been just a few months ago. But now we're in the era of phones like the Galaxy S8, with more screen area than the P10 Plus, and a body that's smaller all the way around. It's not that Huawei did anything wrong there, but the game is changing, and phones that are slow to catch up run the risk of feeling old-fashioned. Maybe more concerning is the build quality. When giving our P10 Plus a firm tap on the phone's back, we often feel the handset reverberating, as if there's a loose spring inside. Now, a little rattle from a phone's camera (and its non-stationary lenses) – that we understand (and there's very much that present here, too). But this is way more pronounced than on any other phones we have sitting around, and has us concerned with how well the P10 Plus is put together. Display Crisp and bright, but choosing bold saturation over accuracy The most obvious difference between the P10 and the P10 Plus is the latter's larger, higher-res display. Instead of the 5.1-inch 1080p panel on the former, this phone is packing a 5.5-inch screen in a 1440 x 2560 resolution. While that spells a significantly higher pixel density, the screen on the P10 Plus exhibits some less-than-great color accuracy. Huawei does offer the flexibility of a settings screen that allows users to tweak settings like color temperature, but that does little to compensate for the general over-saturation. And really, we'd prefer a screen that just worked as it should right out of the box. Maybe the greater problem is how the display feels. Now, this isn't usually a factor we take into much consideration when evaluating a smartphone, and that we're mentioning it here at all should signal to you that something's very wrong. Like some of its other phones, Huawei ships the P10 Plus with a pre-installed screen protector. On its own, that isn't necessarily a problem – even if some shoppers might prefer to make the decision to install such an accessory on their own. And if you're used to screen protectors, this one might not feel much different from those you've already encountered. But we still can't deny that in using the phone we were bothered by the screen protector's sharp edges, and worse: the plastic-y feel of the surface itself. It would be nice if you could just peel this off and start fresh, but as many other reviewers have noted, if you do so you'll discover that the glass underneath hasn't been coated with the sort of oleophobic layer we've come to expect from smartphone screens – and for you non-engineers, that means that it's just a magnet for skin oil, quickly transforming into a smudgy mess. In the end you're forced to choose between this and a less-than-ideal screen protector; we elected to stick with the protector in place.. 6.04 x 2.92 x 0.27 inches. 5.72 x 2.73 x 0.27 inches. 145.3 x 69.3 x 6.98 mm. 6.18 x 3.11 x 0.31 inches. 156.9 x 78.9 x 7.9 mm. 5.86 x 2.68 x 0.31 inches. 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm.

The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright).

I wonder which Chinese company is going to be the first to make an IP68 phone, Huawei has made one but it has flaps to prevent dust and water from entering. So far only it's only left Moto and Nokia. Not sure when Blackberry will make a phone again or if Asus is even relevant.. (Posts: 306; Member since: 04 May 2017). posted on 23 Jun 2017, 07:12. It has nothing to do with flaps. It is about depth and how long it remains under water. Xperia Z3 has 2 flaps, but is IP68. Iphone 7 and u11 are IP67.. (Posts: 5478; Member since: 10 Feb 2012). posted on 23 Jun 2017, 06:35.

(Posts: 1863; Member since: 30 Jun 2014). posted on 25 Jun 2017, 11:15. in response to #12 Hide. However, a DSLR doesn't get the actual true to life colours I was talking about. It's your own eyes...........against which you should compare the shots. And I find the colours, in most shots from iPhone 7, 'truer'-to-life than a Galaxy S8 or any other phone known to me. Sure it may not be able to compare against a DSLR, but that wasn't even my point.. (Posts: 57; Member since: 20 Jun 2017). posted on 25 Jun 2017, 23:37. in response to #13 Hide. I am not offended .But also it's very difficult to compare what you see on a display with what you see in real life .If ever you want to compare the color accuracy of any sensor the display calibration will come into the way. Only a perfectly calibrated display can show the color tones produced by your sensor. But if you compare the shots of DSLR and iPhone on the same display you will get better accuracy because the display will have show same level calibration error. My point to say is you can't compare what colors you see in real life and what colors you see on a display except you have perfectly calibrated display .Because displays have limited gamut and their color reproduction isn't comparable to living world.

The Leica- branded dual-lens camera that thrilled many in the Huawei P9 is back with the Huawei P10. The new Leica Portrait mode combines the previously seen beauty mode and Bokeh effects into a good quality package and offers portrait enhancement features that use 3D facial detection technology, dynamic illumination, and studio-like re-lighting that results in radiant flattering self-portraits.

I had, amongst many reasons, decided to go with the P10 rather than the MI6 of Xiaomi because of the Operation System which seemed to have really nice features, and so I wanted to own their device. After I purchased the phone I naturally installed the apps I use, not to many since I am not a heavy user, but I did install my favorite game Clash Royale. Upon playing the game I noticed when it gets crowded and new items are added to the game the phone freezes! My nephew who is 9 years old and is a very heavy user, plays Clash Royale every available moment he gets (a little scary at times) owns a Homtom HT17 Pro 4G Phablet that cost on website about 80$, the game runs perfectly so you can imagine the frustration!. So, I did some tests and used all benchmark apps, with the appropriate instructions and ran them. I have found that my new device performs very badly, with the worst result appearing on the GPU. The test results were around 1270 +- every run for at least 10 runs after I let it cool down, and during different hours of the day. When you look at the phone while the test is working, you can see it's not working well. The app said that my results are very bad for the hardware and I should clean the ram and wait for the device to cool down and try again (Average result is around 1870 for P10). When I saw tests done from other youtubers, I saw that they got 2200+ and one other got 2680, that’s more than x2 my result. After speaking to Huawei’s customer service department, which was absolutely useless, I decided to go to Huawei Official lab, where they said that they do not know how to test it (O M G) and will contact Huawei Global to see how they can test it. They also told me that if they don't find anything wrong, I will have to pay for the lab tests!!!. So…not only do they not know how to test it, they will also charge money for their ignorance!. I saw a picture on their wall stating that P10 is better than iPhone 7, I have an iPhone 7 and I ran same 3dMarks testing and got 2160 and told them about it and their response was. “What do you expect, its iPhone 7”. Even at their official lab they stated that, the phone is bad compared to other flagships. On top of it all, the customer service told me that my new phone will be fixed and not replaced because that's their policy. Now can you imagine, buying a new phone, it does not work properly and they offer to fix it for you? Disgraceful... If anyone has a P10 Huawei, and can run a 3DMarks test and would be prepared to send me the output, I would very much appreciate it! If we find something wrong with most devices I will act to get a recall for the device. If you own any other Huawei device that is malfunctioned in anyway and you are not b. Want to comment?

IPS-NEO LCD capacitive touchscreen 16M colors. Huawei P10 Reviews - page 2. Rated 5 out of. I have always used Samsung smartphones but couldn't turn down this phone as a better option to S7 and S8 and a far cheaper option too. It paid off - it's a fantastic phone and all the features it has are brilliant. It comes with a factory fitted screen protector and a nice silicone back case. It's really quick, even after downloading a lot of apps and games. The 64gb hard drive is great too so it's unlikely you'll run our of storage quickly which I found I did on my last Samsung - add an SD card and you can maximise it even further. I've been using the phone heavily I haven't been disappointed with anything. It is much better than the S7 (lighter, faster, better camera etc.) for a far cheaper price. Some features are better than the S8 too. All in all, an excellent smart phone. I didn't purchase from the Carphonewarehouse.com. as my network offered me a better deal.. Rated 5 out of. I've had this phone for about a week now and it's great! I was previously using the iPhone 6s which has lasted more than 2years with no problems but, I wanted a phone with more features, better camera quality and customisation.. The first thing I noticed about the P10 is its speed. Seriously, browsing the internet and downloading apps etc is a breeze. The camera for me is important because i use it to film and create video content of my artwork. The colour accuracy is great (although can be a little off in bright light, has been fine with a second photo attempt) photo and video in low light is hands down the best i've had to date on a mobile.. The battery life is amazing, I start my day at 4.30am and on some occasions haven't had to charge my phone till around 3pm the following day.. One thing i would like to mention though is the earphones that came with the device. They work fine but are a bit flimsy straight out of the box. They don't look like they will last very long at all so I'm dissapointed about that, especially as the phone is so well made.. Overall, I highly recommend this phone. As an Apple lover it was scary taking the plunge but i'm glad i did :). Rated 5 out of. Changed to the P10 from iPhone - Very impressed. My wife got the P10 Lite version and I was so impressed with how it performed that I decided to purchase the Huawei P10 and I am so happy that I went with this phone. I changed from iPhone 7 and have found that the Huawei P10 performs much faster and coming from iPhone found the Huawei EMUI skin felt similar in appearance.. Now If you love taking pictures then this is the phone to get as the camera on the P10 is amazing and the LEICA lens is so good with many features to improve and tweak your shots after you have taken them, its great for macro shots and background blurring with a stunning monochrome sensor also. Pictures taken with this phone should impress and you will find it increases your creativity when taking snaps, just brilliant.. Call quality is nice and clear and all my previous apps I have found work much better. The screen is nice and clear and the phone looks really good and has good build quality. I haven't experienced any lag and have found that the HiSilicon Kirin 960 chipset and octa core 2400 MHz 64-bit CPU works really well alongside the 4GB of ram on the phone.. Battery life is better than the previous phone I had also and lasted a full day doing usual things such as checking emails, watching a few video clips on social media and having Bluetooth on and had around 40% battery left at the end of the day at around 8pm. The P10 also has the new USB type C port also so charging is pretty quick also.. Huawei also include a plastic case in the box also which came as a nice surprise and has a pre-applied screen protector to help against scratches against the gorilla glass that is on the phone. Micro SD card memory expansion is also available up to 256GB.. I have looked at Huawei phones before and nearly got one of the earlier P series phones a few years ago and wish I had as they are seriously good phones and if you are looking particularly for a phone that takes great pictures then this should impress.. I can only see Huawei building momentum if they continue to produce phones like this as I found that there are many articles that now list Huawei as the world’s third largest smartphone maker last year (Source: Forbes - 11th September 2017). I am so happy with my Huawei P10 and the wife is pleased with her P10 Lite also so would say to anyone looking for a great phone with plenty of features, has no lag issues then give it a go - you shouldn't regret your decision and I feel that I have a good quality phone that will last me a few years.. The Carphone Warehouse service was great also as I ordered my wife's handset at 5pm on Sunday and it arrived next day and mine was ordered a few days later and that also arrived next day as promised.. Overall very pleased with the service provided and very pleased with the phones that I purchased and im sure you will be too!. Rated 5 out of.

Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus has almost the same features except P10 Plus comes with a bigger display (5.5 inch and Huawei P10 has 5.1 inch). It has also better display quality and the body is splash resistant (repel splashes of water, light water on the device). It has also slightly improved battery than Huawei P10. For these extra and improved features you have to pay Tk. 10,000 more! So, if these features are not a big deal for you and you want to save on some cash, you might go for the P10. But especially if the display (quality and size) is a big deal for you then well, you also need to pay the price.. User Rating: 3.28 ( 64 votes). Huawei P10 Plus Rating by MobileDokan.

Gadgets 360 Staff , 02 March 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Huawei launched its newest flagship smartphones - the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus. The new devices improve on last year's P9 and P9 Plus, especially in the camera department, which continues the company's partnership with Leica. We spent some time with the devices at MWC 2017 and you can check out our first look in the video below.. The Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus come with a starting price of EUR 649 (roughly Rs. 45,700) and EUR 699 (roughly Rs. The 6GB variant of the Huawei P10 Plus is priced at EUR 799 (roughly Rs. Talking about the design, the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus sport a Hyper Diamond-cut finishing that prevents scratches and smudges. On the right you get the volume controls and a red power button while the bottom sees a USB Type-C post, headphone jack and a single speaker grille. The Home Button on the front houses the fingerprint scanner and also comes with some interesting gesture controls. Chamfered edges run along the front face of the phone which is protected by a 2.5D Gorilla Glass 5. Over at the back, you see a smooth rounded design with antenna lines pushed to the edges and the Leica-branded dual camera setup sitting on the top, similar to the P9 and P9 Plus.. Coming to the specifications, both the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus share some similar features including a HiSilicon Kirin 960 SoC (4x Cortex-A73 and 4x Cortex-A53) with an integrated Cat 2/11 modem and Mali-G71MP GPU. Both the devices are offered with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage with the P10 Plus also getting a 6GB RAM and 128GB configuration. Both the handsets also support storage expansion via microSD card (up to 256GB).. The company has highlighted the new Leica dual camera setup for the devices. Both the smartphones feature one 20-megapixel sensor for monochrome details, and one 12-megapixel sensor that takes in RGB details. The rear cameras support 4K video, 3D facial recognition, OIS, 4-in-1 hybrid autofocus, hybrid zoom, and event bokeh effect in mono mode. There are a number modes available as well as manual control of ISO, exposure, RAW output, shutter speed, white balance and more.. Both the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus sport an 8-megapixel front facing camera with f/1.9 aperture and 2x brightness. The dual-SIM devices run Android 7.1 Nougat-based EMUI 5.1 OS. Connectivity options include 4.5G LTE with 4x4 MIMO Technology for faster speeds (exclusive to P10 Plus) , 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, USB Type-C, GPS, and DLNA.. The two devices vary in size with the Huawei P10 sporting a 5.1-inch HD (1080x1920 pixels) display, and the Huawei P10 Plus with a larger 5.5-inch QHD (1440x2560 pixels) display. The former is fitted with a 3200mAh battery while the P10 Plus gets a 3750mAh battery. Both the devices support fast charging, and Huawei claims that 30 minutes of charging can keep the lights on for up to a day.. The Huawei P10 and P10 Plus will be available in Australia, Austria, Chile, China, Columbia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, UAE, the UK, and Vietnam beginning in March..

Huawei P10 and P10 Plus: Performance & Battery Life Report. by Matt Humrick on May 12, 2017 7:00 AM EST. 145.3 x 69.3 x 6.98 mm. 153.5 x 74.2 x 6.98 mm. 2G / 3G / 4G LTE. 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 2x2 MU-MIMO, BT 4.2, NFC, GPS/Glonass/Galileo/BDS. Huawei is clearly focused on improving the performance of its flagship phones. The P9 and its Kirin 955 SoC performed well in our tests and was smooth and quick during everyday use. For the P10 and P10 Plus, Huawei has tweaked the underlying hardware and software to make them perform even better for longer.. Huawei’s EMUI software includes several features to keep the system feeling more responsive. Using the F2FS filesystem for the /data partition improves storage performance, and Huawei’s new “Machine Learning algorithm” prioritizes system resources (CPU, memory, and storage) to improve responsiveness and performance for the foreground app. Huawei is also using compression to increase the amount of data held in working memory.. Inside the new phones is HiSilicon’s Kirin 960 SoC, which uses a big.LITTLE arrangement of four ARM Cortex-A73 CPUs and four Cortex-A53 CPUs. When we looked at the Kirin 960 earlier this year , we found that its A73 core showed higher integer IPC than the Kirin 950/955’s A72 core, but that floating-point IPC generally regressed. The Kirin 960 registered improvements to the memory subsystem too. Even though our lower-level testing produced mixed results, the Kirin 960, which is also used in Huawei’s Mate 9, performed well when running common workloads such as web browsing and photo editing.. In addition to the new CPU, the Kirin 960 also includes a significantly upgraded GPU. The Mali-G71MP8 includes twice as many cores as the Mali-T880MP4 GPU in Kirin 950/955. It’s also based on ARM’s new Bifrost architecture, which includes a number of improvements over the previous Midgard architecture that should help improve shader core utilization.. Huawei, like other OEMs, is currently struggling to procure some of the other internal components—notably NAND and RAM—which can impact overall system performance. Samsung, SK Hynix, and Toshiba have said that they are struggling to produce enough flash memory in the face of increased demand, especially for higher density modules, and issues with ramping up 3D NAND production. This shortage, which applies to DRAM as well, started in 2016 and will likely extend through the remainder of 2017.. With supplies short and component costs rising, Huawei confirmed that it is sourcing memory components from multiple suppliers and stated that it never committed to using any specific type of NAND. Indeed, P10 owners are claiming that some units are using eMMC instead of UFS NAND, along with both LPDDR3 and LPDDR4 RAM. Multi-sourcing is actually very common among smartphone OEMs, particularly larger ones such as Apple, Huawei, LG, and Samsung, for a number of different components, including NAND, RAM, display panels, modems/RF, and camera sensors. Apple has even sourced SoCs from different foundries. Problems can arise, however, if the OEM does not hold its suppliers to the same standards and allows parts from different vendors to vary wildly in performance, which, unfortunately, happens all too frequently.. Based on Huawei’s official statement, we have no way to know who its suppliers are, what components they are or are not using (LPDDR3/LPDDR4, eMMC/UFS), or how many phones are using the potentially slower components. It only said that component selection is random based on the current supply and that there is no way for consumers to know what they are buying before opening the box.. In this report, we’ll establish what components our particular P10 and P10 Plus review units use, and then run them through a series of tests to evaluate everyday performance and battery life. Huawei was able to extend the Mate 9’s battery life over the previous generation, so it will be interesting to see if this is true for the P10 as well.. Please log in or sign up to comment.. Eden-K121D - Friday, May 12, 2017 - link. It is very hypocritical of a company when they market a Product as a flagship but don't hold them to the same standard. It is very bad that they mislead customers about very much slower emmc and then make rubbish claims of optimization. BurntMyBacon - Friday, May 12, 2017 - link. Roughly equivalent or perceptually equivalent is one thing. Clearly different, as is the case with the flash here, is unquestionably unacceptable. Guess I can mark Huawei off my list of manufacturers to follow. niva - Friday, May 12, 2017 - link. The only Huawei I wanted to buy was the Nexus 6P, and only because Google was in charge of the software running on it. Otherwise I'm really not interested in any Chinese phones, this may be generally true for any non Nexus/Pixel phones but the Chinese have earned a special disdain from me many years ago with their practices/software. I'm not interested in this phone. If you gave me one I'll go ahead and try to sell it immediately. AlphaBlaster - Sunday, May 14, 2017 - link. Who writes this innocuous crap? "Trump is ruining his political career?" Trump doesn't have a political career. He is a circus clown told what to say by the wealthy few who are running everything, own everything! They put a magpie frontman in that position to guarantee that their status quo is maintained and increases , by design, to their benefit alone, and to the oppression, impoverishment, and murdering of everybody else. "Providing context?" On what? At this stage of the game, the only 'context' any legitimate person should be engaged in is guerilla warfare!. kaidenshi - Sunday, May 14, 2017 - link. Did you mix up your AnandTech and Facebook tabs?. leexgx - Friday, May 12, 2017 - link. This reminds me of Kingston using different flash that is far slower but nothing on the box to state what it is (only find out when you used it for a bit or do benchmark tests. s.yu - Saturday, July 29, 2017 - link. If they didn't advertise about specific technology or a specific performance standard the product should reach then you can't fault them, not the case for Huawei. boozed - Monday, May 15, 2017 - link. Did we read the same review?. s.yu - Saturday, July 29, 2017 - link. Nice to see more people agreeing with what I've been saying for literally years(since P8), I guess it's inevitable that more discerning customers will come to realize Huawei's deceptive nature as they expand their businesses beyond China. I honestly hope that a company like this would crash into the ground real soon, but I just don't think most of the consumer market is knowledgeable and principled enough for that to happen. virtuastro - Friday, May 12, 2017 - link. I'm glad you said that it's smooth and responsive but not Pixel XL smooth. I want to see how P10/ P10 Plus's camera image quality. But I did saw dxomark review about it.

Download Luminar & Try Free ». The Huawei P10 Plus was announced alongside the standard sized P10, the latest flagship mobile phones from the company. It builds on the success of last year’s P9, with its most interesting (for photographers) feature being its dual-camera setup, which has been co-engineered with Leica. The new Leica Dual Camera 2.0 Pro Edition includes features such as precise 3D facial detection, dynamic illumination and natural portrait enhancements. On the front of the phone is a new front-camera, which is also co-engineered with Leica. It promises to capture twice the amount of light as the previous model, which should make it better for self-portraits. Both of the rear cameras feature 20 megapixel sensors and SUMMILUX-H lenses with a large f/1.8 aperture. Other interesting features include 4K video shooting, optical image stabilisation and an ultra-fast Kirin 960 processor. The main difference between the P10 and the P10 Plus - at least from a photography perspective, is that the lenses are different. For the Huawei P10 Plus, more expensive Leica SUMMILUX lenses are used, compared with the cheaper SUMMARIT lenses, and they’ve also got a larger maximum aperture (f/1.8, compared with f/2.2).. As you might guess from the Plus in the name of the phone, the Huawei P10 Plus is on the large side - which means you’ll probably find you need to use two hands if you’re typing messages or emails.. Like most modern smartphones there are very few buttons on the Huawei P10 Plus. There’s an on/off button, which you can also press just once to turn the screen on/off, rather than switching the phone completely off. There’s a rocker switch, which controls volume, but you can use it to fire off the shutter release, zoom or adjust focus when using the camera app, too (depending on how you program it).. On the front of the phone there’s a fingerprint sensor, which you can set up to recognise your fingerprint for unlocking the phone. When it comes to opening up the camera app, you have a number of different options. You can program the down button to open up the camera app with a double tap - you can also program it to open up the app and automatically take a shot.. An alternative way is to swipe up from the bottom right hand corner of the lock screen - if you do this, you’ll be able to take pictures, but you’ll only be able to view images you’ve taken during that “session”. Finally, you can completely unlock the phone and find the camera app from the listings on the phone itself.. Once the camera app is open, you have a number of different options, but you can just use the camera on the automatic option straight away. If you swipe up from the bottom of the camera, you’ll unlock “pro” mode, which gives you the opportunity to change key settings, including ISO, shutter speed, exposure compensation, AF mode, white balance and metering. It’s great to have this option available for enthusiast photographers who want to take a little more control.. When you’re in pro shooting mode, you can also shoot in raw format. To do this, you need to swipe right from the main screen and you can switch raw shooting on. You can also change other settings, such as image resolution, switching on a grid to help you compose your shots, using a timer, switching on a horizontal level, and adjust how the volume button works.. To make any changes in pro mode, you select the parameter you want to change, then use the slider to make the change. Unfortunately, just like with the P9 model, it’s still not possible to change aperture on the Huawei P10 Plus, which is a shame. If you want to go back to the default settings at any point when in pro mode, let's say you’ve adjusted ISO and shutter speed, you can tap the sun icon to quickly restore everything to the base settings. This makes it quick to start afresh when you need to, rather than having to adjust each setting individually.. Along the top of the screen (or left if you’re holding the phone in landscape format), there’s a few options to be aware of. The first is the flash on/off icon, while the second is the shallow depth of field mode, which you can use to recreate the look of shooting with a very wide aperture lens. Tap this icon, and then you can drag a slider on screen to move between shooting very wide and shooting very narrow. When in playback, you’ll be able to change the focus point by tapping around the screen - this is because the effect is added after the fact.. Also at the top of the screen is Portrait mode, which basically switches on image smoothing for your skin. You can change the “film” mode to choose between Standard, Vivid or Smooth Colours. There’s also a range of digital filters to give your images a more expressive look, such as Valencia, Halo and Nostalgia. Lastly, there’s an icon to switch from using the rear camera to using the front one.. At the bottom of the screen (or right if you’re holding the phone in landscape), you’ll see you can switch between stills and video recording. In the middle of the bottom is the on-screen shutter button - if you’re not using the volume button to capture images, this is what you’ll need to press. If you hold down the shutter button, you’ll shoot continuously until you release it again.. If you swipe to the left from the main screen, you’ll see there’s a host of other options you can use. There’s the standard “Photo”, but just next to it is “Monochrome” - one of the dual sensors is Monochrome, which is used for colour images to deliver detail, but here you have access to shoot only with it. There’s also a range of other modes, including HDR, Slow Motion, Watermark and Panorama.. To change the AF point, like most other smartphones on the market, you tap around areas of the screen that you want to change it to. You can utilise digital zoom by performing an outward pinch motion on the screen - but you can’t zoom if you’re using the highest resolution of 20MP.. Start-up time is quick, presuming you already have the Huawei P10 Plus switched on.. Using the camera app is also nice and speedy, with it locking onto the subject usually quite easily, especially in good light. If you try to get too close to a subject, you will likely see some noticeable hunting around to try and get the subject in focus - with close-up shots you may also see some false confirmations of focus, which is just something to watch out for and check in playback.. © Copyright 2003-2018 Photo 360 Limited.

Huawei P10 Plus review: The P10's impressive big-screen brother. | April 7, 2017 -- 12:40 GMT (20:40 GMT+08:00). Plenty of RAM and MicroSD-expandable storage. No IP rating for water/dust resistance. Conclusions Huawei P10 review: All the greatness of the Mate 9 now fits in your pocket HP Z2 Mini G3 Workstation review: Power in a pint-sized package Honor 8 Pro, First Take: A high-quality handset, with a VR viewer in the box Microsoft Teams review: Serious competition for Slack and HipChat. Huawei has a solid reputation as a smartphone maker, and while the company used to lack the profile to make it a truly leading player, that time has passed. These days Huawei's name is well known, and the launch of the P10 and the larger P10 Plus at this year's Mobile World Congress grabbed the headlines. The P10 Plus is a large, expensive handset that, along with the phablet-sized 5.9-inch Mate 9 , heads up Huawei's 2017 range.. The Huawei P10 Plus is very similar to its smaller P10 stablemate in terms of design and specifications, the main difference being the size and resolution of the display.. The 5.5-inch Huawei P10 Plus (left), next to the 5.1-inch P10. Note the front-mounted fingerprint sensor/gesture pad.. The 5.5-inch P10 Plus measures 74.2mm wide by 153.5 deep by 6.98mm and weighs 165g, while the 5.1-inch P10's vital statistics are 69.3mm by 145.3mm by 6.98mm and 145g. By way of a similar-screen comparison, the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus measures 77.9mm by 158.2mm by 7.3mm and weighs 188g.. Among the available colours is 'greenery'.. There are many colour options -- arctic white, dazzling blue, dazzling gold, graphite black, moonlight silver, rose gold and greenery. Somewhat jazzy naming of handset colours is now well established, but what is 'greenery'? It turns out to be Pantone's colour of the year for 2017 , and its inclusion here is the result of collaboration.. Some of the P10 Plus colour variants have a smooth back while others, like my gold review sample, are very slightly stippled apart from a small strip along the top that houses camera lenses and flash. Presumably this more tactile finish is meant to assist with grip. I found it a little underwhelming, and would have preferred a smooth finish.. My white-fronted, gold-backed P10 Plus and the white-fronted, silver-backed P10 I was sent for comparison are both unbendable aluminium wedges with curved edges and a glossy fascia.. The size of the P10 Plus meant I found it impossible to hold the phone in one hand and reach right across the screen, although I could reach across the P10. The handset's size also has implications for fingerprint login.. The fingerprint sensor is on the front of the P10 Plus, embedded in the space below the screen. This is a point of difference from last year's P9, whose fingerprint reader was on the back. I prefer that location, especially on such a large phone: smooth as the unlocking process was, it was a two-handed operation for me, which wasn't the case with a rear-mounted sensor.. However, the front location of the fingerprint sensor opens up new possibilities in the shape of gesture controls. Touch-and-hold to go to the home screen, tap to go to the previous screen, and slide left to see the multitasking view. If you don't get on with this, you can opt to configure the standard on-screen navigation buttons instead.. For such an expensive handset (€699 for 4GB/64GB, or €799 for 6GB/128GB), purchasers have the right to expect top-notch specifications across the board. So it's disappointing that -- unlike the iPhone 7/7 Plus (IP67), Samsung Galaxy S8/8+(IP68) and LG G6 (IP68) -- the P10 Plus has no waterproofing credentials.. Nor does it have much to shout about in terms of audio. The single speaker on the bottom edge of the handset delivers reasonable sound quality, but it's nothing special and maximum volume isn't particularly loud.. The P10 Plus's 5.5-inch screen has a resolution of 1,440 by 2,560 pixels (540ppi), which is a step up from the P10's 5.1 inch, 1,920-by- 1,080, 432ppi display. Both screens are protected by Gorilla Glass 5 adding a level of ruggedness to the handset. There's no problem with image quality: the IPS-NEO LCD may not be as vibrant as an AMOLED, but it's still excellent. I watched a fair amount of video, and used Huawei's reduced-blue-light Eye Comfort mode to make late-night ebook-reading easier on the eye. The ability to fiddle with the colour temperature allows a degree of personalisation, and it is even possible to schedule Eye Comfort to turn on and off at specific times.. The main issue with the screen is its receptiveness to finger-smears because Huawei has chosen not to apply an oleophobic layer. The screen protector that's fitted out of the box keeps the screen smear-free, but if you remove it the problems begin.. The octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 960 SoC is top of the range -- as it should be in a flagship handset. My review unit had a generous 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage (the cheaper variant has 4GB and 64GB). It's great to see such a lot of storage in a mainstream handset. Call me old-fashioned, but I like to carry my entire music collection on a phone, and that's possible with room to spare here.. If you should need more storage there's a MicroSD card slot, but as is often the case you'll sacrifice the second SIM slot if you use it. I'm not a fan of this 'either/or' approach to a dual SIM setup.. The P10 Plus is just 6.98mm thick, compared to 7.3mm for Apple's 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus.. With 802.11ac wi-fi, NFC, GPS (and Glonass, Galileo, BDS) and Bluetooth 4.2 on-board, the main wireless bases are covered. There's also infrared which I always like to see in a handset: when in couch-potato mode, it makes fiddling with the TV very convenient. Incidentally, the smaller P10 lacks this feature.. The P10 plus runs Android 7 (Nougat) with Huawei's EMUI interface on top. Overlays are often what make or break a handset's popularity, and Huawei has not always fared well in this respect. But EMUI adds lots of useful stuff, including those control gestures I mentioned earlier. There are a fair few preinstalled apps to contend with, but with so much on-board memory this is less of an issue than it might be. Right out of the box I had 109GB free.. Huawei has teamed up with Leica on the camera side of things. The front-facing is an 8-megapixel unit that does duty for selfies and video calls. The main point of interest though, is on the back of the chassis where there are two camera lenses, one for a 20-megapixel mono sensor and the other for a 12-megapixel colour sensor.. I managed to capture some quite impressive photos with this dual camera system during a relatively short test period. I was especially happy with mono images and with those taken in low light, which benefit from the f/1.8 aperture. Note that this is a point of difference with the smaller P10, which has an f/2.2 lens. The ability to save RAW images will please some users, as will access to a full range of manual controls.. The P10 Plus's 3,750mAh battery is charged via a USB-C connector. Thus far I have not run short of power on any single day of use, despite streaming media, doing mobile email, using GPS to get me around on foot and listening to music as part of a standard day's activity. Carry the provided Huawei charger and, thanks to 'SuperCharge', an hour is long enough to almost fully charge the battery. Wireless charging is not supported though.. The high price of the Huawei P10 Plus means that it should have had the book thrown at it in terms of specifications and features. With that in mind, there are some issues that are difficult to forgive: the screen is a fingerprint magnet; the single speaker could deliver better-quality audio and more volume; and arguably it should be water resistant and support wireless charging. I would have preferred the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone, although its positioning on the front does allow for gesture controls.. Still, there's a lot to like here, from solid build to generally high-end specifications and great battery life. Having spent time with both the P10 and P10 Plus, on balance I prefer the larger of the two handsets.
