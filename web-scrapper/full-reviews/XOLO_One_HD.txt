Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device.

System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 5.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min).

Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by: Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 1.0 out of 5 stars DHCP Wi-Fi gets hanged in XOLO. Colour: Space Grey | Verified Purchase. The mobile was good at its first usage. As I have to depend on mails regularly, I carry two MTS Wi-Fi dongles. It happened that after one week of usage, the XOLO stopped receiving signals from MTS as its DHCP signal got lost while connecting. I waited two days, to check if the error gets corrected automatically. I restarted the phone, removed the battery and tried to put static IP value for the Wi-Fi(failed as MTS do not work on static IP), before doing factory reset. Then I tried factory reset and it started working good. Today as on 27Jan, almost one week after factory reset, again the problem popped. Unfortunately, my return policy got closed on 26Jan leaving me no options. It is impossible to do factory reset every week, losing all my personal and official data lost, just to manage with the purchase. I request, if anything can be done from your end or from the manufacturer.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Worth the price... Screen- 5/5 Touch- 3.5/5 Front Camera- 2.5/5 Back camera- 3.5/5 Gaming experience- 4/5 Speakers- 3/5 Battery- 3.5/5 Design and looks- 4.5/5 Heating issue- average Phone abnormally restarts - thrice in 1 mnth Overall good performance for the price of 5000. No problem for internal storage as you can move apps and data to SD card. Most of the high end games are playable.. Like MC5, Asphalt 8, Dead trigger, GTA etc (at average quality) Will not be any software update.. Front facing flash is not for selfie pics.. But if you're taking selfie video then its nice Final verdict Buy- If You are an average user, budget is 5000, don't require 4G, not a selfie shooters. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Good phone. Colour: Space Grey | Verified Purchase. Phone is quite good camera quality is good i brought this for my sis and she is been using it for more than 6 month it works fine just it has became slow but battery backup is quite good.. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Works well for 2 months and got replaced with lcd .... Works well for 2 months and got replaced with lcd. And after 2months, I had the problem with charging and lcd.iseo So I got replaced mobile LCD twice, I replied that if you keep your mobile in trouser and sit on a bike or chair and if the a tight jeans while you sit, then XOLO mobile is not a good choice. Any how good news for me is they do not have a spare part for my mobile and issued a letter DOA. so after talking to Amazon customer service they picked up my mobile last week and waiting for refund in my bank account). 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Xolo The Next Level. Colour: Space Grey | Verified Purchase. Hello guys I am using Xolo one from one and half years ago. This is A best phone for Using. And its have 1 Gb ram. Its Rear camera is 5 megapixel Which gives me a good quality photo. And front camera is Vga quality. Its back side look is so cute. But its battery perfornance is not good. Its never last for long time. Sound quality is not perfect I cant hear ringtone in Crowd. And sometimes I am suffering from Wifi problems.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars Disappointed with the phone and Xolo. Colour: Space Grey | Verified Purchase. The phone's touch became unresponsive within few months of usage, on papers the phone looked very promising within the price range. I was excited to buy it on sale, and finally placed the order on a flash sale. But, through my disappointment, the phone's quality degraded with time. Camera became laggy, opening and closing apps took time even after using the background task killing apps. I called up the customer care, they advised me to reset the phone, to which I did perform a reset. Problem was solved for few weeks, but, then again the lagging problem started making me cringed as to why I bought this phone on first place itself.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars WORST AFTER SELL SERVICE & POOR BRAND! HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING. Colour: Space Grey | Verified Purchase. It was running normal in beginning but then started giving me WIFI signal problems. To my shock I found out upon calling their service center that most of them are closed, I luckily got one open and gave my phone to them to get it fix. Today after 22 days I got my phone with same problem as I submitted because they said their service center is closed now and is opened at different location so we can't fix and submit your phone there. WOW! feeling, what a service! I thought this brand is normal and will live up to expectations but I will definitely not suggest to buy this phone or any phone from XOLO because of very very poor after sell services. My phone is still garbage after all these days and I don't know if I am even taking this pain to call me again which they never answer or care about. I will rather give this phone to someone who don't need WIFI feature so they can use it as NOKIA 1100. I wish I could give it 0 star.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Good product. Colour: Space Grey | Verified Purchase. One the first hand the look is very impressive and the built quality is good comparing to other Xolo models. This phone only takes Micro sim. The display quality and touch is good. Baterry life also looks very good although a better judgement could be made only after 3 or 4 recharges. Over all I am satisfied with this product especially at this price range you cannot expect anything more. BTW I am not a heavy phone user and its excellent for my need.. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Good. 1.0 out of 5 stars One Star. 3.0 out of 5 stars Three Stars.

Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed.

The company confirmed via a Facebook post that the registrations for the Xolo One HD will begin in three days. 4,777, the smartphone will be available exclusively via Amazon India. The company so far has not revealed when the handset will go on sale in India. The Xolo One HD smartphone features a 5-inch HD (720x1280 pixels) display, which is said to be the highlight of the handset at this price point. The Android 5.1 Lollipop-based One HD smartphone offers dual-SIM support. The handset is powered by a 1.3GHz quad-core processor clubbed with 1GB of RAM. It packs 8GB of inbuilt storage and supports expandable storage via microSD card (up to 32GB). It sports an 8-megapixel rear camera with 1.4-micron pixel size and LED flash.

When you open the box you will be delighted to see the smartphone nicely tugged in a cover case and there is a temporary screen guard on the device.. Xolo One HD looks decent for the price tag was my first impression for the device. It does not look cheap either from the front side or from rear, nor will you be able to make out that it is a sub 5K smartphone you are holding.. Xolo One HD don’t feel like a bulky device nor it belong to the thin category. It is quite easy to hold and feel natural in hand.. The smartphone don’t have thin bezels as probably shown in lot of promotional pictures on Amazon India or by Xolo. There is thick with 2-3 mm space like most smartphones, sorry to break the truth but the images are photo-shopped to make the looks much better from the front.. The display is 5.0 inch and comes with a HD resolution with 1280*720 pixels resolution and 293 PPI. I was able to observe that the display have pixels, it don’t look pixelated but you can differentiate when you keep at the side of a Full HD display smartphone.. Moreover I am used to Full HD display resolution on smartphone so my eye is more attuned to observe minute change in the resolution.. Display looks over saturated and is quite bright with color gamut a bit far from the real colors. Though it is not poor to look at or read text and watch any pictures or images on the screen.. We compared the color reproduction of the smartphone with the Google Nexus 5 and a Macbook Pro retina display. Overall the screen has satisfactory properties.. The display is good for reading and text looks clear on the 5.0 inch screen. Reading in the black and white was good experience, screen has good amount of brightness and there is an adaptive lighting mode in display settings which can be used to reduce the strain on eyes and even will help reduce the battery drain.. Smartphone don’t lag in our brief usage, we opened up lots of Apps and then closed them but did not felt the lag on the device. Surfing the net using WIFI was smooth experience, no issues or lag felt while using Chrome browser and checking out websites.. We watched a 20 minutes Youtube Video on WIFI at a 480P resolution streaming there was again no lag found on the device. Good thing was there was no heating while watching the video at least on the WIFI.. You will definitely like the display while watching videos on you tube and stored HD movies.. Sound Quality – Speaker and Calls. Sound quality is good, and speaker volume is also decent. Audio is loud and clear and you can easily use the speaker to listen to call audio as well as songs with no difficulty.. on the XOLO One HD and the score looks good for the device. The Antutu Score for Xolo One HD is 24069. I tested my Google Nexus 5 which scores 37000 on the Antutu. It is a good performance as far as Antutu is concerned.. Will be shared in detail in the updated article. However we played Candy crush it is a light game and runs on most basic mobiles for some time and there was no issues. We also tried the subway surfer and it also worked fine without any lag. We also played the Modern Combat 5 and the Asphalt 8 on Xolo HD and it offers good performance on the HD screen.. Gaming on the 5 inch screen feels god and the sound from the speaker is decent to enjoy the games.. Rear Camera Quality – Sample Pictures. Rear camera has decent performance, and is able to take pictures with clarity. There is noise definitely in the low light indoor conditions but bearable image quality. Here are couple of samples of Outdoor images which we took. 8 MP (1.4 µm and 5P lens) primary camera with auto focus. The autofocus is fast and responsive.. Images were taken in the morning light and seem to be decent for the outdoor shoots. The 8 Mega pixel camera is not the best we have seen but neither is bad when compared to other smartphones. Image size is usually close to 3 MB are are shot in high resolution.. Front Selfie Camera Quality – Xolo One HD Review. The front selfie camera stands out compared to all other features of this smartphone. I loved the soft flash which don’t fill the image with too much of harsh light and makes them look natural.. Xolo One HD Front Camera Selfie Shots. Check out the close shot of the Volkswagen it is really clear and while taking close shots even in indoor settings camera performed upto my expectation. The front camera comes with a5 MP (1.4 µm and 4P lens) with flash.. The front 5 Megapixel camera is much better compared to lot of smartphones I have seen with 5 MP shooters. I think they could have named it Xolo One HD Selfie smartphone.. If you are selfie lover and don’t want to spend too much on the smartphone, this a selfie smartphone under 5K which you need to buy right now.. The smartphone comes with 3G connectivity which we found to be working as normally as in any other smartphone. Wifi and 2G also was okay without any glitches on my Xolo One HD.. The smartphone lacks the 4G LTE support and also does not support the USB OTG function. The smartphone has dual sim support.. Storage Space Operating System Pre-installed APPS. The smartphone comes with 8 GB of internal storage which can be further expanded to 32 GB using a micro-sd card. There are lots of pre-installed Apps which come with the XOlO One HD. Around 3 GB space is already occupied by the Android Lollipop OS and the pre-installed Apps while user have around 4.98 GB storage available for installing Apps and storing media files.. Battery Life – How long it lasts. The battery drain was rapid when we started the smartphone, and after the first charge we saw an improvement to battery life. We expect 2-3 more full charge and discharge cycles for the battery to give complete picture of battery life on device.. As per the current experience will call it just passable as the device was able to run for 4 hours with us doing lots of testing and benchmarking, playing video games and what not on the device.. We can expect it to last till late evening with moderate usage and location settings turned off. More on battery life in couple of days.. As per the testing and experience done so far here are the things I liked about the smartphone and the things which could have been better.. The build quality is good and the smartphone don’t feel cheap in hand the metallic edge around the frame makes the looks even better. It is easy to use and handle and have reasonable weight.. The Bezels are not thin as I stated above, Xolo or Amazon should not show images which are actually not 100% true. However there is nothing wrong with the design and display for the device.. Performance is okay and what I expect from a smartphone in this price range. Display is good however I fount the color saturation is there on the screen and looks more like an AMOLED display than a washed out IPS LCD display.. Camera is decent, the rear camera can click good images in day light and indoors also. The front camera is something I really liked in the smartphone with the light tone flash. You can check the above images and make it out yourself about the camera quality.. For the affordable price of Rs. 4777, Xolo One HD packs a lot of punch and is really good purchase if you are looking for a 5.0 inch screen smartphone with a good front camera for clicking selfies.. 10 Best Smartphones Under Rs 5000 Good Specs India 2016.. 10 Android Mobiles Priced Below Rs 7000 India.. 10 Best Affordable Smartphone Under Rs 4000 India..
