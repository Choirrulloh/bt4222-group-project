Please try your search again later.. An unlocked phone is a device that is not bound to any carrier or plan. It allows you to choose your phone first and your carrier second. Upon selecting a plan, simply insert the carrier's SIM card into the phone and you're ready to go. If you decide you want to change carriers down the road or want to take an international trip, it's as simple as replacing your existing SIM card with a new SIM and activating your new plan.. What are the benefits of an unlocked phone?. Freedom: Choose the carrier with the best service or price. If you find a better deal later, you have the ability to change to a different carrier.. Travel: Take your phone internationally and use the carrier of your choice. It's as easy as inserting an active SIM card.. Selection: Choose the phone with the features you want, whether or not your carrier sells it, and get more service options without a contract.. How do I set up my unlocked phone?. The first thing you’ll need is a SIM card for your desired carrier. When activated, the SIM card will let your phone connect to your carrier’s network. If you decide to upgrade to a newer unlocked phone in the future, you can easily remove the SIM card from your old phone and put it in your new phone—just make sure you get the right size of SIM card (nano, micro, or standard) for your phone. If you want to use your phone while traveling internationally, you can easily buy a SIM card for a carrier that operates where you’re traveling. As long as it’s activated, you can just swap SIM cards when you arrive at your destination.. 0.4 x 2.7 x 5.3 in. 2.88 x 0.32 x 5.71 in. 0.4 x 2.71 x 5.24 in. 0.37 x 5.98 x 3.06 in. 0.34 x 2.8 x 5.41 in.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Sold on the new Microsoft environment and the Icon phone is great!. To put this review in context, I've upgraded my cell phone every couple of years since 1992 when I had my first Motorola brick; so I've owned a lot of cell phones and all the smart ones. I'm not a fan of Apple products but my spouse has one so I'm not unfamiliar with them. I'm an IT professional and I've worked with so many different operating systems I've lost count but half a dozen Unix variants, 3-4 Linux Variants, every version of Windows since 1.0, and the Apple OS. I run both a personal Google Identity and Google Apps for my small business. I've had my phone for a week and I bought the DT910 charger for my desk and the DT900 for traveling. This phone is just wonderful, I gave the Verizon store clerk my Microsoft identity name and added my password when she passed it to me. By the time I got home the phone had completely synchronized with my desktop and laptop. It's seamless: just different windows into the same "ME". The sound quality is great; the camera is brilliant (I'm an amateur photographer with several thousand in semi-pro equipment); I can link together all my contacts various identities (google, skype, facebook, etc) into a single unified contact list; Facebook, Kindle, Audible, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft Office, all work great. Before I bought the phone the Verizon folks told me that no one liked the Windows phone because it didn't run all their apps. And there are some applications that are not available yet for Windows 8. The only one I miss is TripIt but this is more than made up for by the seamless integration with Microsoft Office. (Update: I found TripIt) I wanted a working phone that integrated seamlessly into my work environment; gives me a great camera, delivers my core communication needs; the Icon hit that target dead on. I've never been happier with a new phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars 4 Stars for Windows Phone. I went from the Galaxy Note 2 to this Lumia Icon. Switching platforms can be a pain. Most people are so vested in one OS they are reluctant to change. I really like this Windows Phone. It came out of the box with Windows Phone 8.1 and now currently has Windows 10 Mobile. Though it is smaller than the Note 2 the screen is bright and vibrant with the resolution at 1080 x 1920. Even in the glare of the Sun the phone automatically adjusts for better visibility. The camera has a rich motion view which show the pictures you just took in motion like you have just taken a very short video. It is a very welcome touch. The phone fits well in my hand the curved bottom feels perfect. The dedicated camera button is nice as well. Windows Phone is not for everyone. To many people care about the hot apps and games. I have used this phone for over a year and It's a very welcome change. No longer am I lost in useless apps and games. Instead I can stay productive with the array of very usefull Office apps. Even though FaceBook is on the Windows store use this platform has encouraged me to stop using FaceBook all together and trust me folks, it's a good thing. The hardware is just like those of Android and iPhones. The only difference between this platforms is with Windows Phone you don't have all that other bloat in the app store consuming your precious time.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Phone. Just wish there was a little more support for Windows phones. I have an Apple phone for work and the Icon runs circles around it. Apple and Android look and feel pretty much the same (wallpaper, icons on the screen, scrolls sideways, etc.) No two Windows phone looks the same because of the customization feature i.e. live tiles, ability to choose the size of each tile, colors, wallpaper in the background, etc. Cortana is absolutely the best mobile assistant and is extremely accurate at picking up your voice commands. Great screen size and the OS just gets better and better. Plus the ability to look at, edit and create documents in Word, Excel and PowerPoint is awesome. In PowerPoint you also have the ability to view and edit your slides and notes from the phone and with the Icon the text is big enough that you can see it if your phone is on a podium. Great low light capabilities and takes much better photos than my wife's Galaxy S5. Very easy to learn how to use if you are new to the Windows mobile OS. My previous phone and first smartphone was an Android which was hard to get used to, especially with a horrible owners manual which didn't tell you how to use it and the tutorials on the phone wouldn't boot up from day one. The Window's OS is user friendly and extremely easy to use.. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars The most disappointing phone upgrade ever for me.. I had the 928 before this 929 and liked it 2 stars more. Too many issues, some of which are Verizon's fault. Camera software lousy on this model, magic wand rotates image 4-6 degrees. Not going to pay $300+ for the latest model, the 930. I like the Andriod interface better than windows, but prefer my iPad to my Galaxy tablet. Android phones last only about half as long as iphones, according to research (Average android OS support is ~30 months and IOS is ~70). The hardware may as well be cheap plastic. I have a beautiful Acer tablet that has a Google OS, and Google nor Acer will update, and now I get insatiable recurring Google error popups every 40 seconds. Looks brand new with a stunning display of the Google BM. 0 Comment | Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Upgraded this one to Windows 10 and it runs very smooth. All the buttons work, only minor scratches on the phone I got. 5.0 out of 5 stars Windows Phone is The Best. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars I reccomend. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Happy. I love this platform so it's great for me, however what's really cool is that this phone come loaded with W10 over regular 8 when it was released. 5.0 out of 5 stars Powerful and current alternative OS. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Great device, horrible windows phones, ill never buy another windows phone, Microsoft clearly doesn't care about their mobile users, I bought this when windows 10 was coming out... 1.0 out of 5 stars Great device, horrible windows phones. The phone I ordered had some problem that didn't allow it to upgrade above windows 8, which I don't like. I have since returned it with no hassles, awaiting the refund.. 3.0 out of 5 stars Not what I wanted, but maybe just a fluke.

Esto también se puede leer en español.. 5-inch Windows Phone nails it on specs, screen. Nokia Lumia Icon (Verizon Wireless) - black. Nokia Lumia Icon (Verizon Wireless) - white. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The feature-packed Nokia Lumia Icon has a gorgeous screen, a fast processor, and a proven 20-megapixel camera. The Bad Its flat, slab design is uninspiring, and the Icon is a little heavy and thick. Call quality was mediocre, and media hounds won't be able to expand storage with a microSD card.. The Bottom Line Buy the Nokia Lumia Icon for its beautiful display and well-rounded features, but skip it if you require gobs of storage, are on a budget, or prefer a power user's OS.. The 5-inch Nokia Lumia Icon isn't small by any means, but it does fit in the hand. Verizon commissioned the Icon in two shades: white with a silvery trim and all black. The SIM card tray takes a little effort to pry open. Buttons on the side include the camera shutter. Good things may come to those who wait, but they also come to large, powerful carriers with tremendous bargaining power. Such is the case with the Nokia Lumia Icon (also known as the 929), a 5-inch, quad-core smartphone with a 20-megapixel shooter and a soberer look and feel that Verizon can claim as its very own. The addition of the $200 Icon to Big Red's roster -- it goes on sale February 20 with a new, two-year service agreement -- marks a much-needed refresh to Verizon's Windows Phone lineup.. Staunch Nokia supporter AT&T still claims the glory for both the largest Windows Phone handset and also the most advanced camera phone you can buy in the US, the 6-inch Lumia 1520 and 41-megapixel Lumia 1020 , respectively. The Icon's proven features and competitive specs make it a strong contender for any superphone-seeker on Verizon, and one of the top three Windows Phone devices anywhere in the world.. Portrait of a Nokia Lumia Icon (pictures). Design and build Although it can count the round, bright Lumia 1520 as a sire, the Lumia Icon more closely resembles another Verizon-only phone in the looks department, the 928 , than it does the supersize smartphone.. Never mind that it's smaller; it's also boxy, with squared-off edges and sides flat enough to balance the Icon upright. A barely curved back adds some in-palm comfort and a real aluminum rim tries to class up the white or black polycarbonate backing. I'm not personally a fan of the phone's tile aesthetic; to me it lacks the personality I prefer in Nokia's screamingly colorful finishes.. That said, pretty much every Nokia phone also comes in black and white, and this steep-sided design does make the rounds from time to time. Nokia also combined aluminum parts with a muted palette in the Lumia 925 , sold with T-Mobile in the US, but that phone's rounded spines and contouring gave it a much more visually interesting and premium look and feel.. The Icon's dimensions -- 5.4 inches tall by 2.8 inches wide -- slot right in to today's array of larger phones, though it does seem like a thick, hefty slab of smartphone, at 0.4 inch thick and a solid 5.9 ounces. It isn't so large I couldn't carry it around in my back pocket, and I could even maneuver it one-handed. Overall, I found it comfortable enough to hold and use without complaint.. A 5-inch 1080p HD AMOLED screen is the star of the show, and as usual, Nokia gives the Icon's display its best. Rich color, brightness, and pixel density to the tune of a 441ppi make photos, videos, and high-definition images leap off the screen. Nokia's ClearBlack Display filter cuts down on glare outside, and the ever-so-slightly curved Gorilla Glass three-topper promises to keep viewing angles wide enough for friends.. If you're in need of more juice to beat extra-bright environs like sun and snow, you can ratchet up the screen brightness; and if you're wearing gloves or tend to navigate with fingernails rather than the pads of your digits, there's a setting for that, too.. Around the edges, buttons for volume, power, and the camera shutter cluster on the right spine; you do your charging business at the base, and plug in your headset at the top. There's an oddly shaped nano-SIM card tray up there too, which you have to pry open with a perfectly angled fingernail, or else cast about for a useful tool.. Over on the back is where you'll find the 20-megapixel camera module and dual-LED flash. The front-facing camera rests above the screen, to the right of the speaker grille. Four microphones address your audio needs, one each at the top and bottom of the front and back sides.. The only other features to point out are things that aren't here: a unibody handset means you won't be able to pull out the Icon's battery, and there's no microSD card slot for external storage (read more on this below.). OS and apps One of the first things you'll notice when looking at the display is that there are three columns, not just the usual two. This is a direct result of the Windows Phone 8 Update 3 OS version, a clunky name to describe a few extra features, like this tri-column view. That means you can dramatically increase the number of icons on the home screen before having to scroll down for more.. The phone also gets topped up with the Nokia Black software update , which adds a bunch of Nokia apps and also support for low-energy Bluetooth.. If you're unfamiliar with Windows Phone, you'll find some typical features, like multitasking, voice actions, and music identification. There's Wi-Fi, GPS, NFC (with security built into the SIM to go with the e-wallet), and Bluetooth 4.0. Integrated Qi wireless charging is also on board.. The Microsoft Office suite is one of the advantages of the Windows Phone OS, but Nokia also adds value with a whole bundle of its own apps, especially for the camera. You're looking at image editors and panorama, but also Nokia Here maps, MixRadio, Nokia Beamer, and Drive+ navigation. Bing Weather and Bing apps are other Microsoft additions.. Amazingly, Verizon keeps the preloads to a minimum. You'll see NFL Mobile, Verizon Tones, and VZ Navigator, but not much more.. Windows Phone as an OS has a clean, fresh design and a few nice touches all its own (like Xbox integration and the aforementioned Microsoft Office.) It has legitimately gained its share of fans. And yet, there are problems that need fixing, and a slow rate of growth over the last three and a half years. The Icon represents Windows Phone well, but in some respects, the OS quite simply trails behind Android and iOS .. Camera and video Just like the 1520, the Icon comes with a 20-megapixel camera sensor with a six-lens Carl Zeiss optical assembly and optical image stabilization.. The high megapixel count sounds impressive, and it is, though you won't really nab 20-megapixel images. Instead, Nokia relies on a technique called oversampling to capture a 5-megapixel image at the same time it stores a 16-megapixel copy. When you crop (and zoom in), you take advantage of the full-resolution image, which you can store in the default 16:9 aspect ratio, or as a 4:3 ratio (19-megapixel). The camera has an f/2.4 aperture.. What's image quality like? Very good. Many of my indoor and outdoor pictures were crisp and detailed, with sharp edges. Even casual photographers will appreciate uncovering the details captured in an oversampled shot. One downside, though, is that the camera configuration doesn't handle macros and close-ups very well. In a sense, cropping is the only way to really get right up to your subject.. Not all of my photos were perfectly in focus; some never shaped up despite several attempts. Nokia cameras also tend to tint scenes blue, but I didn't see a whole lot of that in my test shots. What I did notice are slight variations between the image I was seeing through the viewfinder and the resulting photo; usually the photo was a little worse.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

The Nokia Lumia Icon (originally known as the Lumia 929 [2] ) is a high-end smartphone developed by Nokia that runs Microsoft 's Windows Phone 8.1 operating system. It was announced on February 12, 2014, and released on Verizon Wireless in the United States on February 20, 2014. [3] [4] It is currently exclusive to Verizon and the U.S. market; its international counterpart is the Nokia Lumia 930 .. On February 11, 2015, Verizon released the Windows Phone 8.1 operating system and Lumia Denim firmware update for the Icon. [5] [6] On June 23, 2016, Verizon released the Windows 10 Mobile operating system update for the Icon. The primary features of the Lumia Icon are: [9]. The phone was released for sale exclusively through Verizon in the United States for $199.99 with a 2-year contract or $549.99 with no contract. [12] The Lumia Icon has almost identical internal specifications to the larger Nokia Lumia 1520 with the primary difference being that it has a smaller screen of 5 inches compared with the Lumia 1520's 6 inches. The Nokia Lumia 930 , released in April 2014, is nearly identical to the Icon in both appearance and specifications. However, the 930 uses GSM radios and comes with Windows Phone 8.1 and the Cyan firmware, and is the worldwide variant of the Icon. While the 930 has since been updated to Denim (which contains the Windows Phone 8.1 Update), Verizon previously faced criticism for not releasing the Cyan update for the Icon. Now that Verizon Wireless has updated the Icon directly to Denim, skipping Cyan, the OS and firmware distinctions have largely been eliminated. While in development, the Nokia Lumia Icon was known by its model number. Early development screenshots and prototype accessories referred to the phone as the Lumia 929. [13] [14] This was in keeping with Nokia's previous branding practice of assigning a corresponding number to the place where the phone would sit in Nokia's lineup, with higher numbers indicating higher-end models and lower numbers indicating lower-end products. Upon release, the phone kept the model number 929, but was the first Lumia to utilize a name other than its model number for branding. The Lumia Icon received fairly positive reviews, with some reviewers calling it the best Windows Phone released, praising the phone's camera quality, display, and overall speed but detracting its being locked to one carrier and having a camera with a slow transition time between taking photographs. Reviewers were split on the design of the phone, with some praising its metal build quality as solid and premium, and others criticizing it for being too utilitarian and conservative. Brad Molen of Engadget called the Lumia Icon "the solid high-end Windows Phone that we've wanted for a long time. It has an amazing display, great performance and solid imaging capability, but its exclusivity to Verizon will severely limit its appeal." [12] and Mark Hachman of PCWorld said "If you’re an app fiend, you’d still be better off buying an iPhone or Android phone, which dependably receive third-party apps. But the Icon and Lumia 1520 are clearly the best Windows Phones on the market. Deciding between them simply depends on which size you prefer." [17] Christina Bonnington from Wired said that the best Windows Phone ever still disappoints, and mentioned poor call quality as one of the detractors, but praised the solid build quality, inclusion of wireless charging, and powerful processor. ^ a b c d Rubino, Daniel (Feb 12, 2014).

With the Nokia Lumia Icon as a Verizon exclusive, our prayers for the Lumia 1520's awesome specs to appear in a more manageable body, have seemingly been answered. The handset is way more compact with its 5" Full HD display, but sports the same excellent 20 MP PureView camera with optical image stabilization, and not two or three, but four HAAC mics for noise cancellation, adding to the fast Snapdragon 800 chipset and 2 GB of RAM, making it one of the best Windows Phones a two-year contract can buy.. Nokia Lumia Icon vs LG G2 Nokia Lumia Icon vs Samsung Galaxy S4 Nokia Lumia Icon vs Apple iPhone 5s Nokia Lumia Icon Review Nokia Lumia Icon manual Nokia Lumia Icon benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.39 x 2.79 x 0.39 inches (137 x 71 x 10 mm). Weight: 5.86 oz (166 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 5.0 inches. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor, Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 3). Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Optical image stabilization, Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Face detection, Smile detection, Digital zoom, Touch to focus, Geo tagging. Settings: ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: Burst mode, Panorama, Night mode, Scenes. 3840x2160 (4K) (30 fps), 2560x1440 (QHD), 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (30 fps). Features: Optical image stabilization, Continuous autofocus, Video light, Video calling, Video sharing. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Focal length (35mm equivalent) - The lower (shorter) the focal length number, the wider the shot will be. Conversely, longer focal length cameras produce narrower frames, which can be used for telephoto (zoomed-in) purposes.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Stand-by time: 18.0 days (432 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 16.40 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: DLNA. Features: Album art cover, Background playback, Music recognition, Preset equalizer, Dolby Headphone. GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz.

A technique of multiplexing, also called spread spectrum, in which analog signals are converted into digital form for transmission. For each communication channel, the signals are encoded in a sequence known to the transmitter and the receiver for that channel. The foremost application is digital cellular phone technology from QUALCOMM that operates in the 800MHz band and 1.9GHz PCS band. CDMA phones are noted for their excellent call quality and long battery life.. Notifications: Service lights, Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Phone profiles, Flight mode.

Nokia Lumia Icon review: a big step forward for Windows Phone. When Nokia came out with the Lumia 1520 , we were treated to a new side of Windows Phone. All of a sudden, Microsoft's smartphone OS had come of age; it was using the best available hardware specs and a wave of big-name apps had finally arrived in the Windows Phone Store. Even so, we were concerned that the 1520's 6-inch screen size and AT&T exclusivity in the US would limit its appeal.. Last week Nokia announced the Lumia Icon , a new Windows Phone with nearly identical specs in a smaller, 5-inch frame. Finally, the perfect device for Microsoft to take on its high-end Android and iOS competition, right? Well, almost -- the Icon is a Verizon exclusive, arriving tomorrow for $200 on-contract (or $550 with no strings attached). Meanwhile, the other three major US networks don't offer anything comparable yet (outside of AT&T's 1520, anyway). That said, the Icon is still worth a look if you've already decided on Big Red.. Gallery: Nokia Lumia Icon review | 63 Photos. The Lumia Icon is the solid high-end Windows Phone that we've wanted for a long time. It has an amazing display, great performance and solid imaging capability, but its exclusivity to Verizon will severely limit its appeal.. Windows Phone has grown up a lot lately. The Lumia Icon is the platform's new poster child, offering specs that would make even the most discerning of power users drool. That includes Nokia's 20-megapixel PureView camera, a 5-inch 1080p display, top-of-the-line quad-core Snapdragon processor, 32GB of internal storage, 2GB of RAM and a 2,420mAh battery, to name just a few specs. You can check out the full list below, but for now, you get the idea.. All told, it's hard to find fault with the specs, but the hardware itself is potentially... With its square shape, sharp corners and flat sides, it's as if Nokia took the Lumia 928 and changed the material from glossy polycarbonate to aluminum on the perimeters and matte polycarbonate on the back. Nokia used this same combination of materials on the Lumia 925 , but that phone had a less severe design, one marked by gentle curves. What's more, the non-removable back here bulges out slightly from the rest of the chassis. The idea was for the camera to sit flush with the device, but even so, a flat back would have made for a more streamlined look. Finally, at 5.86 ounces the Icon is a little heavy -- heavier than the 4.5-inch Lumia 1020 , anyway. That said, it's still significantly lighter than the 6-inch 1520, which means it's also more comfortable to carry around.. On the other hand, the aluminum sides and polycarbonate matte back make the Icon feel reassuringly sturdy. In particular, its 5-inch frame is small enough to fit snugly in my hand, and the edges have a blunt cut that left my fingers plenty of room to grip the device. At 9.9mm thick, it's thicker than most high-end smartphones, but the arched back helps make its size less of a detractor from our enjoyment of the device. Oh, and speaking of durability, Nokia and Verizon must have focused on making the Icon as iron-clad as possible, because in addition to the metal sides, the phone rocks a Gorilla Glass 3 display. The glass itself curves slightly outward, so it's exposed a little more than a standard flat sheet; it makes sense, then, that Nokia would want the glass to be as scratch-resistant as possible. It's not shatterproof, so you still don't want to drop it face-down on concrete, but you should at least feel comfortable putting it in the same pocket as your car keys.. As an aside, although those metal sides look nice and do indeed provide some extra durability, they're also quite prone to dings and scratches. This is an issue we've experienced with the latest iPhones and the HTC One , to name but two examples. We didn't see anything show up in our time reviewing the device, but if you're going to be using the Icon for a year or two, the sides may look like the surface of the moon by the time you're done with it. It may do a good job protecting your phone from impact, but it probably won't emerge without a few battle scars.. Farther down the back, you'll see two Verizon logos next to the external speaker grille. The sound comes out loud and clear, despite its awkward placement toward the top of that sloping back cover. You'll also notice two tiny holes on the back for microphones (one near the top, one near the bottom). These make up just half of the phone's four-mic setup for directional audio recording; the other two are located on the front. And, as with most Verizon phones, you also have the option of wireless charging, thanks to an embedded Qi module.. The right side of the Icon features the typical three-button layout that Windows Phone users have become accustomed to (for novices, this includes a volume rocker, power button and two-stage shutter button). The Icon's keys stick out pretty far, but for some reason I had a difficult time pressing the camera button gently enough that I didn't cause shaking and camera blur. Ultimately, I felt more comfortable taking shots with the virtual on-screen shutter button.. The micro-USB charging socket sits along the bottom edge of the phone, while the 3.5mm headphone jack lives up top. For symmetry's sake, both ports are flanked by a pair of antennas. However, there's a nano-SIM slot on the top-left corner that renders pointless any effort to make the sides look symmetrical. The Icon's SIM slot features a small divot instead of a pinhole, so you'll need to dig out the SIM card using your fingernail. As I discovered, this makes it much more difficult to open if your nails happen to be well-trimmed.. When we saw the Lumia 1520's 6-inch, 1080p display, we couldn't wait to see how that kind of screen quality would look on a 5-inch device. Having finally gotten our wish, we're happy to say the Icon doesn't disappoint. This time Nokia went with a 1,920 x 1,080 AMOLED ClearBlack panel, with a pixel density of 441 ppi. As expected, the dark colors are darker here than on the 1520's LCD screen, while the whites are just a shade dimmer. One of the nice things about this type of display is that the darks blend in with the bezel, making the screen feel more expansive than it actually is. Color saturation is on par with the 1020's OLED display as well, but if you don't like it, Nokia offers the ability to adjust it, along with the color temperature. In addition, we could easily see the bright, 500-nit screen in direct sunlight, and the viewing angles are some of the best we've seen.. Since the Icon is a Verizon exclusive, its LTE radio runs on Verizon-compatible bands (700/AWS, to be specific). When 4G isn't available, it also supports 3G CDMA. Although we're disappointed that it doesn't feature global LTE roaming of any kind, international travelers can use it on most GSM networks around the world; it has quad-band HSPA (850/900/1900/2100) and quad-band GSM/EDGE (850/900/1800/1900). In fact, since it's unlocked, we were able to use an AT&T SIM and get an HSPA signal.. Nokia Lumia Icon Dimensions 136.9 x 70.9 x 9.9mm (5.39 x 2.79 x 0.39 inches) Weight 5.86 oz (166g) Screen size 5.0 inches Screen resolution 1,920 x 1,080 (441 ppi) Screen type OLED ClearBlack; Sunlight Readability Enhancement; High Brightness Mode; Gorilla Glass 3 Battery 2,420mAh Li-Polymer(non-removable) Internal storage 32GB External storage None Rear camera 20MP Zeiss, OIS, f/2.4, wide-angle lens, AF Front-facing cam 2MP sensor (1.2MP stills) Video capture 1080p / 30 fps (rear); 720p (front) NFC Yes (with secure element on SIM) Radios Bluetooth v4.0 LE SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 (MSM8974) CPU 2.2GHz quad-core GPU Adreno 330 RAM 2GB Miscellaneous FM radio, GPS/GLONASS, micro-USB 2.0 HS, four-mic setup WiFi Dual-band, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wireless Charging Yes, Qi standard Operating system Windows Phone 8, Update 3/Lumia Black. Windows Phone 8 is now on its third major update , and the latest firmware allows the Icon to have all of the best specs on the market. Nokia took this update, bundled it with its own suite of software features and functionality and called it the "Black" update. This is the same setup that we enjoyed on the Lumia 1520, as well as a litany of older devices that also run the new software.. Aside from the obligatory Verizon apps, which are limited in number and can all be uninstalled, the Icon comes preloaded with the usual Nokia and Microsoft necessities: You'll have roughly 500 Nokia apps (slight exaggeration), a handful of Here apps for navigation, the upgraded camera app, Data Sense, a few Bing apps and so on. There's nothing out of the ordinary here, and nothing we haven't touched upon before.. One thing worth noting is that since the Icon has a 5-inch display, it qualifies as a "larger screen" and is rewarded with a third column of icons on the Start Screen, just like the 1520 has on its 6-inch display. Despite the fact that you get more screen space on the Icon than the 4.5-inch Lumia 1020, the Live Tiles are actually smaller on the Icon so you have more room for that additional column.. High-end Lumia phones and good imaging seem to go hand-in-hand. Nokia's always excelled at mobile photography, and it's recently raised the bar with its PureView tech, which we earlier saw in the Lumia 1020's 41-megapixel camera. That camera was so impressive, in fact, that even something as stellar as the Lumia 1520's 20-megapixel shooter felt a little like a downgrade. The Lumia Icon's camera is closer to the 1520's, since it shares many of the same specs and characteristics. If that counts as cutting corners, then we can live with that.. As with the 1520, you'll get optical image stabilization, a six-element lens, an aperture of f/2.4 and a sensor size of 1/2.5 inch (much smaller than the 1020's 1/1.5 inch). It uses the same software algorithms and oversampling technology featured on the 1520. As you might expect, the experience is near-identical too. We won't go into great detail on how the PureView model works -- look no further than our Lumia 1020 review for the full explanation -- but on the Icon, you'll get a high-res image taken at 19 megapixels along with a 5MP lower-res shot, which will come in handy for uploading your photos to Instagram, Facebook or whatever service you want. (This is for shots taken in 4:3 mode; you can also snap images in 16:9 assuming you don't mind a dip in resolution.). The best part of Nokia's photo experience is the camera app, which gives you a full suite of manual settings to help you get the perfect shot -- ISO, white balance, exposure and shutter speed can all be adjusted in real time, so you're not wasting time poking around the settings menu. And, as part of Nokia's Black update, you now have the option of getting a copy of your high-resolution photo in RAW (DNG) format. If you're limited on storage (32GB is a lot, but there's also no microSD slot), we'd recommend you switch over to the standard high-res JPEG option, since each RAW file takes up nearly 25MB of space..

Performance and battery life Nokia Lumia Icon Nokia Lumia 1520 Nokia Lumia 1020 WPBench 471 466 223 Battery rundown 2:42 3:30 2:12 SunSpider 1.0 (MS) 538 546 906.2 AnTuTu (*GPU test off) 25,750 (23,241) 25,148 (22,275*) 11,084 (9,874*) SunSpider: lower scores are better. Largely thanks to the Icon's smaller aperture, the 1020 still technically takes better photos in low-light situations, but even so, we were rarely disappointed in the Icon -- as long as there was even a smidgen of light, we were able to achieve well-lit, detailed shots. We couldn't rely on the shutter button for these images, however, since it's harder to press and any little shake or bump resulted in blur. In daylight, our sample pictures showed more color saturation, and a white balance that was slightly warmer than on the 1020, although the dynamic range wasn't quite as high. So while there are clearly some trade-offs, all but a few imaging enthusiasts will find both phones satisfactory.. Videos are captured at 1080p, and in traditional PureView fashion you get to choose among 24, 25 and 30 frames per second. (You can also bump the resolution down to 720p if you prefer.) The level of detail here is pretty good, and a bit rate of 19 Mbps certainly helps, but we noticed that the continuous focus is a little too active. What's more, our fast-paced action footage was sometimes choppy. In low-light conditions, the camcorder had an even more difficult time trying to stay continually in focus; the footage wasn't as crisp and the white balance even shifted on occasion. On the other hand, we picked up impressive audio, thanks to the four-mic setup. In our sample video, for instance, the two front-facing mics did a fantastic job filtering out the noise of a nearby construction crew. Aside from the superb audio, you shouldn't expect more on the video front than what you'd get from any other flagship device.. Right now, at least, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor reigns supreme, which means the Icon (clocked at 2.2GHz) is among the best in its class. And while even low-end Windows Phones run well, it's still so much nicer to play graphics-intense games on a device with a top-of-the-line chip. Games like Asphalt 8 play smoothly, and we noticed that the phone saved and rendered its high-res images faster than the Lumia 1020. (In fact, it was even faster than the 1520.) In short, this is the best-performing Windows Phone we've ever used. As for synthetic tests, it scored slightly better than the 1520 on every benchmark test we ran, as you can see in the table below.. Battery life was a big question-mark for us going into this review, just because high-res screens and powerful quad-core chipsets are known to take a toll on runtime. In this case, though, none of that appears to make a difference. The Icon's 2,420mAh battery lasted through a 12-hour day that included nonstop GPS navigation, streaming music, emails and phone calls. We still had roughly 35 percent juice left over, which means you should have no problem squeezing out a full day on a charge. And with more moderate usage, you can even get through a day and a half -- not bad for a 5-inch flagship device. The only thing that gave us pause was when we were taking a steady flow of pictures and videos for testing; in one instance, the battery drained by 25 percent in an hour.. Call quality is above average, which shouldn't come as a surprise to most Verizon customers, and the volume (for both internal and speakerphone calls) is loud enough that we didn't have to crank it up to the max settings to hear comfortably. It handles movies and music quite well, and we had no Bluetooth connection issues. We were also able to quickly pinpoint our location via GPS, but we noticed that the Here Drive app sometimes failed to re-route when we went the wrong way.. The Icon doesn't have a lot of Windows Phone competition at the high end. As we said earlier, the Lumia 1520 is the only other device with the same top-shelf specs, but it's only available on AT&T in the US and is a significantly larger phone. On Verizon, your only other options are the HTC 8X ($50 on-contract), Samsung ATIV Odyssey (one dollar) and the Nokia Lumia 928 (free), none of which come close in terms of specs or performance.. For now, the Icon rests on top of the Windows Phone world, but it's hard to know for sure how long it will stay there. Samsung's rumored to have a high-end WP8 device coming out on Verizon. Then there's Windows Phone 8.1 , which is rumored to launch sometime in April with a full lineup of new devices. In short, there's lots of good stuff ahead.. As of this writing, the Lumia Icon is the best Windows Phone device. Just like it did with the Lumia 1520, Nokia managed to cram a fantastic imaging experience into state-of-the-art hardware. But unlike the 1520, the Icon is small enough to appeal to the masses. Although it may not be the sleekest handset, the Icon is still a sensible option (if not the best option) for Verizon users who want the best photo-taking experience possible -- and don't want to sacrifice other specs to get it.. It's unfortunate that this combination of size, specs and functionality is only available on one carrier in the entire world. But on the bright side, this may change in the near future: Nokia will likely announce new Lumia devices in the next few months, which means the Icon may soon be just one in a handful of high-end Windows Phones. Even if that happens, however, the Lumia Icon will still be a great choice for anyone interested in a good Windows Phone device on Verizon. Its beautiful display, speedy processor and good battery life are just a few reasons to give it a close look. Most important, though, is what this means for the future: The last two high-end Windows Phones have been much better than anything we've used before, and it's only going to keep improving..

[ Further reading: The best Android phones for every budget. Nokia: Shouldering the app burden Mark Hachman. Simply put, Nokia’s latest Windows Phone, the $200 Lumia Icon for Verizon, is solid. It's solidly built, and sits solidly atop all other available Windows Phones. And, yes, it even ships with a solid app lineup, with most of its software bearing the Nokia name.. Nevertheless, for a phone whose legacy includes the 41-megapixel Lumia 1020 , the Icon suffers one flaw that should give you pause: noticeable shutter lag of more than a second from the phone’s 20-megapixel sensor. Although the Lumia Icon includes a wealth of manual settings within the Nokia Camera app—along with a nice mix of associated creative software—none of it matters if you can’t capture the original shot.. The Lumia 1520 (left) towers above the Lumia Icon.. Aside from the terrible shutter lag, people with smaller hands will find the Icon a noticeable step down from the Lumia 1520, Nokia’s 2013 phablet, but in the best possible way.. Icon shares the 1920x1080 resolution of the Lumia 1520, it’s much smaller:. 5.39 inches by 2.79 inches by just 9.9 mm (0.39 inches). The 1520, meanwhile, is a 6-inch device.. Shrinking the display size produces a corresponding increase in pixel density to 441 pixels per square inch—that's 35 percent more pixel density than the iPhone 5s’ “retina display." The Icon is small enough for most people to. with just a thumb, tracing the phone's Gorilla Glass 3 from edge to edge.. As noted above, the Icon feels solid. It's a mix of polycarbonate and metal that weighs 5.86 ounces, or 20 percent less than the 1520. I would recommend a case, however, as even the matte finish still won’t stop the Icon from slipping from a careless palm.. A combination of metal and polycarbonate gives the Icon a solid feel./. The Icon’s 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon CPU is identical to what you’ll find in the Lumia 1520. In the newer phone, it launches and runs apps in a snap. It’s a sealed phone, so there's no slot for removable storage, but the 32GB of internal storage is supplemented by 7GB of free OneDrive cloud storage. As far as battery performance goes, the Icon survived 7 hours and 50 minutes of continuous video playback during our homegrown rundown test.. Besides the size, the other noticeable difference between the 1520 and the Icon is the newer phone's OLED display, which offers deep blacks and high contrast ratio. Outside, you shouldn’t have any problem reading the Icon’s display, even in full sunlight. And like earlier Nokia phones, the Icon’s display includes. Sunlight Readability Enhancement and High Brightness Mode, two features specifically designed for outdoor use.. The difference may be slight, but web pages and other white backgrounds do look better rendered on the OLED screen.. Shutter lag has long been a bane of smartphone cameras, but the most recent handsets from Apple and Android manufacturers have licked the problem. The Icon suffers serious shutter lag that's painfully out of step with modern standards.. In fact, I noticed lag of up to 1.5 seconds while shooting. (I took pictures of a stopwatch app on another phone, timing the shutter to increments of 10 seconds, then recording the results.) From focus to shot with the flash off, I noticed lag of 1.3 to 1.5 seconds. That's on par with a Lumia 928 that I tested against. An HTC 8X Windows Phone produced lag of about 0.5 seconds.. Much of the Icon's lag can be eliminated by pre-focusing the camera. You simply depress the camera button half-way—though this. forces you to anticipate you next shot.. Otherwise, the Zeiss optics (f/2.4, wide angle lens, with optical stabilization) generally performed well in terms of image quality, although with a bluish cast to some of the photos. Naturally, the phone records 1080p video at 30 fps. A front-facing selfie camera grabs 1.2-megapixel photos.. I've included some sample photos below, which you can click to view in detail. In each case, I've compared the Icon's camera output to the output of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (when you click, note that Samsung images appear on top; Nokia images appear on the bottom).. In every case, I used default camera apps, and all settings were left at “auto.". From a productivity standpoint, Windows Phones win bonus points simply by including the suite of mobile Office apps, although editing and especially creating documents can be next to impossible on a small, mobile vehicle.. Nokia, however, has filled in some of the gaps on the consumer side with apps like HERE+, a real-time traffic app that ships free with the phone. Apps like Nokia’s screen-sharing Beamer app and the Nokia MixRadio Pandora clone complement the Camera app itself, with its limited (but welcome) manual refocusing and other options, including a whole submenu that crops up when the “smart sequence” burst mode is launched. There’s also Nokia Storyteller, which creates albums or stories based on where photos were taken; Cinemagraph, an animated GIF creator; and Creative Studio for on-app photo editing.. A manual focus mode allows Lumia Icon owners to craft shots using bokeh.. You’ll be able to connect globally, as the phone uses. GSM (850MHz, 900MHz, 1800MHz, 1900MHz) and UMTS (850MHz, 900MHz, 1900MHz, 2100MHz). 802.11 a/b/g/n/a radio for Wi-Fi connectivity, or Bluetooth 4.0 LE.. Call quality will obviously vary by location, depending on your proximity to Verizon’s cell-phone network. I noticed little difference in call quality between the Icon and the Galaxy Note 3, based on a voice mail I left myself. Other callers who I spoke to didn’t prefer one phone over the other. I did think that a call connected through the Icon’s speakerphone sounded noticeably warmer than calls through the Note 3's speakerphone.. Nokia has also designed in four mics on all sides of the phone, both as a built-in noise reduction system as well as to provide a sense of direction to sounds recorded by the phone. This did a serviceable job both in cutting noise and improving video, somewhat eliminating the monotone effect of most smartphone video.. For any Windows Phone fan considering a move to Verizon, buying the Icon is a no-brainer. And Nokia’s apps provide justification for ditching an older phone like the HTC 8X (which I’ve personally owned and enjoyed), and moving to the Icon.. Owning a Windows Phone, however, still feels like living a year or so behind the rest of the market. If you’re an app fiend, you’d still be better off buying an iPhone or Android phone, which dependably receive third-party apps. But the Icon and Lumia 1520 are clearly the best Windows Phones on the market. Deciding between them simply depends on which size you prefer..

Free Amazon Fire TV 4K w/ 1 month of DirecTV Now. Xbox One X | Surface Book 2 NEW Dell XPS 13. Our full review of Verizon's new flagship Windows Phone. On February 20th, Nokia and Verizon are bringing the highly anticipated Lumia Icon to market. The phone has been rumored for months, even going by the previous moniker of Lumia 929. But now it is finally getting the spotlight treatment.. For all intents and purposes, the Lumia Icon is a Lumia 1520 jammed into a smaller, more nimble device. With a more practical 5-inch 1080P display, 32 GB of internal storage, Qi wireless charging and a whopping 20 MP PureView camera, all in a body that is only slightly taller than its predecessor, the Lumia 928, it’s hard to see how this phone could fail.. So, does the $199 device live up to the hype? Is this the ultimate Nokia Lumia? Read our full review for all of the details and watch our video hands on, after the break!. Going way back to September 2013 , rumors of a smaller, sister device to the Lumia 1520 – which itself was still a rumor – began circulating. A few months later, the haze cleared and what remained was the Lumia 929, a grown up version of Verizon flagship phone from earlier that year. The Lumia 928 was itself an interesting phone, a device inspired by the Lumia 920 but with an OLED display and a new Xenon flash. So a follow up was highly desirable.. The leaks of the Lumia 929 continued to flow with release dates coming and going. Unfortunately, the Lumia 929, which was later renamed to the Lumia Icon, never appeared in 2013. Well, at least not by Verizon directly. The phone did make its way, albeit briefly, to a Chinese retailer. Indeed, I’ve had the device for weeks now, thoroughly enjoying the phone on Verizon’s rapidly growing LTE network here in New York.. Luckily for Verizon customers, the phone goes on preorder today and will be available next week for $199 on a two-year contract. It’s been a long wait, and many phones have been released since the Icon was first rumored. Featuring the same specs as the Lumia 1520, the Lumia Icon is much smaller and easier to handle. It has cutting edge hardware, a great 1080P display and an impressive 20 MP camera.. The Lumia Icon is only on Verizon, with no chance of going to other carriers. The design is a bit uninspired, with only black or white colors available. Many people shied away from the Lumia 1520 due to its massive size. The Lumia Icon from Verizon fixes that, by making it only a hair taller than the Lumia 928. It's packed to the gills with cutting edge hardware, including a 2.2 GHz Quad-Core CPU, making it in many ways, the ideal Windows Phone that many have wanted.. Windows Phone 8 Update 3 , build 10521. 5” full HD 1080p OLED display, ClearBlack, Sunlight readability, Glare-free, Super sensitive touch, Gorilla Glass 3. Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 Quad-Core processor, 2.2 GHz. Camera: 20 MP PureView, ZEISS optics, OIS, 2x lossless zoom, oversampling, dual LED flash. 32 GB internal storage (no micro SD). 2420 mAh internal battery with Qi wireless charging. Dimensions: 5.39 x 2.79 x 0.39 in. Networks: LTE: 700MHz; SVLTE Band 13; Band 4; CDMA: 3G EVDO 850/1900 Rev A with Rx Diversity; Global Ready: GSM (850MHz, 900MHz, 1800MHz, 1900MHz). Looking at those specs and you have about 90% overlap with the Lumia 1520. Where they do differ, the Lumia Icon surprisingly comes ahead in some areas, at least compared to the AT&T version of the 1520. For instance, you get that coveted Qi-wireless charging, which has become a go-to feature for many users. While there is no expandable storage, 32 GB of built in adequate for most people. Finally, that CPU is one of the latest and fastest around and it simply makes the Windows Phone OS fly.. I’ve already covered the 20 MP camera on the Lumia 1520. While it’s not as powerful as the monster shooter in the Lumia 1020, it doesn’t need to be, it’s simply an awesome camera on its own.. There’s really nothing to not like about the Lumia Icon in terms of specs. It can easily go toe to toe with any high end Android on the market today and yes, it’s relatively future-proof. The Snapdragon 805 isn’t due to until the second half of this year and it’s hardly as groundbreaking as the Snapdragon 800 compared to the 600 series.. Plus, the Lumia Icon will get Windows Phone 8.1 later this year, like all current Windows Phone handsets.. If there was one personal complaint about the Lumia Icon, it’s the same one I had about the Lumia 928: Verizon tends to suck away some of the creative and bold design choices by Nokia, for a more conservative approach. No yellow or red phones here, instead you get either white or black. And while the back of the Lumia Icon is ‘ergonomically curved’ to our liking, the overall design is a bit generic.. But that’s a personal, aesthetic choice. Many people in fact desire a low-profile phone and let me be clear, there’s nothing about the design that is bad in that it hurts the Lumia Icon. Who am I to tell you that you need a bright yellow phone? Go all matte black or be ‘outrageous’ with white. Either way, you’re getting really good hardware.. Undeniably, the Lumia Icon is in my opinion leaps and bounds better in build quality over the Lumia 928. That device was very ‘plasticy’ and my phone, months later, has some awful creaking. Not so with the Lumia Icon. The reason? Nokia opted for a metal chassis with a polycarbonate back. It was a brilliant decision as the Icon feels much sturdier this time around. It’s cool to the touch on the sides, but the back is a welcome non-glossy design that lends itself to being cradled in your hand.. Yes, Nokia and Verizon have the familiar ‘pillow’ design that we saw with the Lumia 928, it’s just better this time around with a higher quality build.. The display is the familiar curved glass that we’ve seen on other Lumias. It feels great to use, being smooth to the touch. We’ll have more on the display below.. Moving to the sides, we have the volume rockers, power button and camera shutter on the right side with no button the left. The buttons are ceramic, with a chilly metal feel to them. They’re sturdy, easy to discern without looking, and they feel great when depressing them. On the top of the device you have a 3.5 mm headphone jack in the middle and on the opposite end (bottom) you have the familiar micro USB port for charging or connecting to a PC for syncing. Both are accented with grey bars, which is an interesting design choice.. On the front, you have backlit keys for Back, Start key and search keys. They look good and have fairly even lighting. Near the top front you have the earpiece and front-facing camera along with the Verizon and Nokia logos. The keys have a haptic feedback with a short, solid vibration.. The back of the Icon is clean with the 20 MP PureView ZEISS camera, dual LED flash microphones. The metal accent strip of the Lumia 928 is gone, and instead it’s just smooth polycarb on the back.. Speaking of microphones, you have four digital high-dynamic-range mics on the Icon (also known as High amplitude Audio Capture, or HAAC). It’s the same setup as the Lumia 1520 and they allow high quality stereo recording with distortion free audio, perfect for concerts or loud events.. Verizon and Nokia are pushing the Lumia Icon as a media device, perfect for movies and photos. With the Lumia 1520 review , I focused heavily on the size, since it is a rather enormous device. I have no problem recommending this phone’s size to anyone. Comparing it to the Lumia 928, it’s practically the same phone, it’s just the Lumia Icon is a smidgen taller. That’s remarkable when you consider you getting a 1/2 inch larger display that’s higher resolution, a 20 MP camera (versus 8.9 MP) and you get a bigger battery (420 mAh more with the Icon). It goes to show you how moving to the Snapdragon 800 and some newer tech can result in a more powerful phone, without sacrificing size.. 5 inches is more manageable than 6. And weight? The Lumia Icon is 166 grams, which is just 4 grams more than Lumia 928. That’s essentially nothing and it’s still much lighter than the Lumia 920 (185 grams). While I wouldn’t say the Icon is lite , with its metal frame and quality build, the device feels… balanced .. Using the Lumia Icon one-handed? Check. While those with small hands may struggle, I’d say that moderate sized hands will have no issue using the phone with one paw, being able to stretch across the display to tap a Tile. That’s unlike the Lumia 1520, which requires two hands often to use.. The Lumia Icon opts for an OLED display, the same found in the Lumia 928. But the resolution is bumped to 1080 x 1920 versus 768 x 1280. Windows Phone 8 looked fine at the latter resolution, but with 1080P and a whopping 441 ppi, the OS really shines. Plus, you get that third column of Tiles, which came with Update 3.. The Icon also features Corning Gorilla Glass 3, making it slightly better than the Lumia 1520. It’s smooth, doesn’t leave many fingerprints and it has a 180 degree viewing angle. Combined with the rest of Nokia’s technology like ClearBlack (dual layer polarizer), sunlight readability (super brightness outside) and the vibrant contrast of the Windows Phone OS, the display is nearly perfect.. Sure, some people don’t care for OLED tech over an IPS display, as the former tends to saturate the colors, but Nokia has tossed in their Lumia Color Profile (in Settings) to adjust things to your liking. Make the colors cool or warm, contrasting or neutral. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still stuck on the 1520’s 6-inch display—it’s real hard to go back. But the Lumia Icon just feels right at 5 inches. It’s more, dare I say, normal and if you’re coming from 4.5 inches, you’ll barely notice a change, in a good way.. There is one lame thing about the Icon and that is it doesn’t support the Glance screen. For those who aren’t familiar, Glance is a Nokia technology that allows static information to be displayed on the screen when in standby. It shows the time and with Update 3, can optionally show notifications as well. It’s super useful and with the Glance Background app, you can even customize it with your own images.. But yes, Glance is not available on the Lumia Icon out of the box, nor with any system app updates (e.g. Extras + Info , which did not change the situation). That also means no double-tap to wake, as the two features are intertwined.. Nokia says this is due to “certain hardware restrictions” and they’re not ruling it out in the future, but as of today, the Lumia Icon will remain a Glance-free device. That’s a bit of a letdown, especially for a flagship Lumia, but if you never used it, then there’s nothing to miss. But if you were looking forward to it, then…. The Lumia Icon, like all Nokia phones, handles calls admirably. While it eschews the big speaker and grill that was featured on the Lumia 928, the Lumia Icon gets a fair rating for a speakerphone. The Lumia 1520, due to its sheer size, still handily wins for best audio quality on pretty much any device I’ve used, including some Androids and iPhones. I suppose Nokia and Verizon had to sacrifice something to get the rest of that tech in there, and the rear speaker was one of those (the other was the Xenon flash).. Phone calls through the earpiece, which is how most people will use the Icon, were above average for smartphones and on par with Nokia’s other Lumias, that is excellent.. Reception was fine, with no dropped calls or issues noted during my testing.. For GPS, the Lumia Icon supports A-GPS and Glonass and they worked very well together, with no problems ascertaining my position quickly.. I won’t concentrate too much on the Lumia Icon’s camera, because it’s the exact same one found in the Lumia 1520. Readers of this site know probably know I have pretty much every Lumia made and while I appreciate the Lumia 1020’s massive 41 MP camera, I more often than not find the Lumia 1520’s 20 MP camera with ZEISS optics more than adequate for my everyday needs.. Dual-capture: 5 MP oversampled + 19 MP (4:3) or 16 MP (16:9) full resolution images. Dual LED flash for Images and Video. HD 1080p Video Capture @ 30 fps Video. HD front facing camera with 2 MP sensor and 1.2 MP stills and 720p video.. The same is true with the Lumia Icon. But let me delve a little into the specs:. Those are all very admirable specs for a smartphone camera in 2014. Combined with the fact that Nokia actually knows what they are doing in mobile photography and you get outstanding performance from the Icon.. Like the Lumia 1520, the color and white balance were accurate for most shots and with the quad-core processor, the normally sluggish Nokia Camera app is significantly faster than other Lumias. Having said that, some people coming from the iPhone or Android may still find the Icon a dash slower. However, as you can see by the above snow shot, the white balance struggled with the snow, a common issue with digital cameras.. You also get to shoot in RAW (DNG) optionally and get dual-capture, with HD photos at 16 MP and 5 MP photos for sharing via email or social networks. It’s a cool system, resulting in full resolution images for later editing in Photoshop, including RAW images, plus you can still post things to Instagram without a massive upload toll. It’s truly the best of both worlds.. Read our guide on shooting in RAW and how to make the most of it on your Lumia Icon.. I’m not a flash user, though if I have to use it, I want it to be good. Many will lament the decision to not have a Xenon flash on the Lumia Icon, whereas the Lumia 928 famously did. Xenon flashes are, for the lack of better words, ‘real’ flashes. Where a dual LED is more akin to a torch. Because of this difference, Xenon flashes can do cool stuff like “freeze” people in motion (or even the more dramatic, freeze fan blades in rotation).. While I’m not going to argue that a dual LED flash is as good as a Xenon (it’s not), I will say the result for most instances, is quite impressive. Specifically, the Icon gets the white balance right (the Lumia 928 despite the Xenon sometimes had a yellow hue) and the shadow fill is better, with less light focus in one area.. So yes, for certain instances, Xenon is undoubtedly better, but dual LEDs have significantly improved over the years and I’m fine with it on the Icon.. Everything else, including the front facing camera, is the same as the Lumia 1520. To see this camera system up against the Lumia 1020, make sure you see our photo comparison between the two .. Windows Phone 8 Update 3, Lumia Black. With a 2.2 GHz Quad-Core CPU and a 5-inch 1080P display, you would think that the 2420 mAh battery may not last long. That, despite the fact, that the Lumia Icon has a 400 mAh advantage over the Lumia 928. But the Snapdragon 800 is really good at managing battery life, as any Lumia 1520 owner can attest to, and the Lumia Icon is the same.. While I don’t put an exact hour usage on the Icon, suffice it to say I had no issue making it through the day with moderate usage and battery life should not be a concern.. Toss in the built in Qi wireless charging, and picking up a few re-charges during the day is easier than ever. I happen to have a few Qi chargers laying around, so it’s real easy to plop down the Icon to gain back some juice during the day. Qi is more than just expedient, it’s awesome and I’m glad it’s here on the Icon. Shame on AT&T for removing it from the Lumia 1520.. I’ve written about Update 3 in the past and you can find our overview and comprehensive coverage below. In short, Update 3 (OS build 10521) is the latest release of the Windows Phone 8 operating system. The Icon is running on all cylinders in that regard, coming with that OS preloaded.. Update 3 brings things like support for HD displays and Quad-Core processors. It also offers better Bluetooth functionality, Driving Mode to manage calls and text messages in the car, screen orientation lock, customized alerts for email or text messages, and the ability to close apps running the background. It’s a great update, one of the finishing touches before Windows Phone 8.1, due in a few months. The Lumia Icon will surely get that update, which you can read more about from our 8.1 guide .. Likewise, the Icon comes with Nokia’s latest firmware release, dubbed Lumia Black. That includes some camera enhancements, RAW support and other under the hood fixes for their customized software.. The Verizon Nokia Lumia Icon is basically running the latest of everything from Microsoft and Nokia, as it should.. Nokia has recently teamed up with some third party manufacturers , ensuring that there will be an ample amount of cases and screen protectors for your Lumia Icon , should you choose to buy one. That’s a change from the past where ‘custom’ carrier phones like the Lumia 928 were often left without many choices.. Verizon will be stocking a handful of cases on release day for this phone, and while I’m not convinced this phone needs a case – it’s not as susceptible to slippage like the Lumia 920 or Lumia 1520 – should you desire some protecting, you should be able to have a hearty selection on day one.. Offerings from Incipio and Otterbox, to name a few, should be available at your local Verizon store, and you'll want to keep your eyes locked on our Windows Phone Central store for more Lumia Icon Accessories .. What happens if I put an AT&T or T-Mobile SIM into it?. If you have a Lumia 928 and want a new device, then getting the Lumia Icon is a natural upgrade path. In fact, assuming finances are not an issue, I’d easily recommend anyone with a Lumia 928 to grab this phone. You’re getting a much beefier processor, superior camera and a display that is both larger and higher resolution.. The best part? The thing feels like a 928 in terms of size.. If you’re coming from Android and iOS and you’re eyeing the Lumia Icon as a ‘switcher’ device, then I can also recommend it. The Windows Phone OS sits between iOS and Android for complexity, in fact I’d say it’s almost easier than the iPhone. It’s a solid device, one that you will be able to use for a relatively long period due to the current hardware on board. Basically, you’re getting what I would call a prime Windows Phone experience.. Video and photography buff? The Lumia Icon is literally being marketed to you by Verizon. This phone has a 20 MP PureView camera with ZEISS optics and some of the best optical image stabilization (OIS) around, making videos of your kids or concerts a primary selling point.. Coming in at $199 on-contract, the Lumia Icon is not exactly a steal, but it falls in line with Verizon’s flagship offerings. The fact is, nothing is cheap on Verizon.. What about new Windows Phone 8.1 devices? Good question. As I’ve said, the Lumia Icon will be able to get the 8.1 upgrade, but there’s no telling if Microsoft’s next update will take advantage of new hardware. Sure, in 8.1 on-screen keys will replace physical keys on some hardware releases (it’s up to the OEM) but besides that, it’s a question mark. I can say that Verizon is not known to churn out too many Windows Phones per year, so I don’t expect a new flagship 8.1 device till at least the end of 2014, making the Icon a safe bet for now. That is, unless you were considering changing carriers.. All in all though, I think those on AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint will be eying the Icon with envy. It hits the specs right down the middle.. The Lumia Icon comes SIM unlocked, so yes, you can toss in a nano SIM card for any network and the phone will work. You should also pick up Nokia Access Point to ensure appropriate network and MMS settings. That app will install to Settings.. However, depending on your carrier’s LTE setup, your data connections will vary:. Networks : LTE: 700MHz; SVLTE Band 13; Band 4; CDMA: 3G EVDO 850/1900 Rev A with Rx Diversity; Global Ready: GSM (850MHz, 900MHz, 1800MHz, 1900MHz). For T-Mobile, you can get HSPA (3G) connections, and it will fall back to the super-slow 2G Edge otherwise. It does not support T-Mobile LTE and I was often stuck on Edge, meaning the Lumia Icon will technically work but it’s far from ideal.. For AT&T, things are only slightly better with HSPA+ in certain locations and of course there is no issue with phone calls. However, I was not able to get LTE data either.. In other words, the Lumia Icon can work on other US networks, but you’ll be most likely sacrificing LTE network speeds to do so. Probably not the wisest bargain if you’re considering purchasing it off-contract.. The Lumia Icon for Verizon is in many ways, the most ideal Windows Phone made so far. While many consumers coveted the specs of the Lumia 1520, just as many were put off by the sheer size. Or AT&T’s gimping of the massive phone. The Lumia Icon pretty much solves this problem by knocking the display down from six inches to a more evenhanded five, and in doing so, they have nailed the ultimate Lumia.. In fact, I can only come up with three weakness of the Lumia Icon, and those are all mild criticisms:. The Glance screen omission is really the only nit of this device, and even that doesn’t rise to the level of outrage against AT&T for removing Qi from the Lumia 1520 or hobbling it at 16 GB of internal storage. It’s disappointing, but hardly a deal killer and there’s not even a guarantee that it won’t happen at some point.. The Lumia Icon being only available on Verizon is also minor. The fact is, if you’re on Verizon or are considering switching to Verizon, you don’t care. For those on AT&T, T-Mobile or Sprint, you’re probably rightly jealous, but that is kind of the point. I don’t see this phone having a ‘global variant’ as many like to say. It’s a Verizon device through and through and it will stay that way, just like we never saw the Lumia 928 go to any other carrier. That doesn’t mean there won’t be a new flagship Lumia for the Windows Phone 8.1 launch in mid-2014 fitting this range, but it won’t be this phone.. The fact is, Verizon ordered up this phone from Nokia, so to the victor go the spoils. Kudos to Verizon and Nokia for giving the Lumia that many people have desired. Now make it in red .. Likewise, complaining about the design being ‘unexciting’ is also inconsequential. It’s simply my personal opinion, one that you may not share. The design elements do not detract in any way from device functionality and in the end that is all that matters.. All in all, Nokia and Verizon have delivered a well-made, cutting edge Lumia. The size is perfect, the specs are impressive, and it’s a real blast to use. You have everything that is great about the Lumia 1520 tucked away in a more agile body, which is something many of you have asked for. The Verizon Lumia Icon is now the definitive Windows Phone.. The Nokia Lumia Icon will be exclusively available on Verizon starting Thursday, February 20 for $199 on contract. Preorders start today, including Microsoft Stores for just $25 down.

Only available for Verizon Wireless in the United States. The Nokia Lumia Icon for Verizon Wireless is the most capable smartphone to come out of the Finnish manufacturer to date. A successor to the Nokia Lumia 928, the carrier-exclusive Windows Phone handset ticks all the boxes of a proper flagship smartphone - from the chipset, through the camera and the display, all the way to the premium build and finish.. Despite being fresh on the market, the Nokia Lumia Icon is hardly unfamiliar. The smartphone shares most of its innards with the Nokia Lumia 1520 phablet. They include the beefy Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset, as well as the capable 20MP PureView camera with Carl Zeiss optics. Here's what else the Icon has to offer.. A quick glance at the key features reveals that the Nokia Lumia Icon is almost as well-equipped as a smartphone can be these days. Last year's GDR3 update for Windows Phone 8 opened the platform to the latest available hardware, so Nokia's high-end smartphone is as good any Android powerhouse currently on the market (and not too far behind the upcoming flagship wave, either).. In addition to the beefy internals, the Nokia Lumia Icon relies on the Finnish company's traditional strengths to succeed. They include hugely capable camera, nicely spec'd display, and good looks to go with an array of exclusive and handy services.. All in all, the Nokia Lumia Icon has the making of a solid high-end smartphone proposition. We are not going to waste any more time introducing the smartphone. Head over to the next page where we will kick the in-depth review off with an unboxing of the Windows Phone flagship.. Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include some of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our home office and test lab. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the device in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Unboxing, design and build quality, display.

For what I use a smartphone for, talking, texting, listening to music, Netflix on the go, and killing time with games, I'd be hard pressed to find a better device to suit my needs. I would even go as far to say the choice of quality games on windows phone is way better than android. Having just given my LG g2 to my daughter a couple of weeks ago, I can honestly say the only thing I miss about that phone is the knock on knock off feature which is not even a standard android feature. And to top it all off I've got one of the top cameras ever to grace the backside of a cellular device!. This review is the subjective opinion of the user and not of PhoneDog.com.

Posted on: March 6th, 2014 by Ben Pangilinan Ditzoso. well i can't find a reason why lumia icon is behind lg g flex, galaxy s4, bb z10 and moto x. but i must say it's a great phone. killer specs, smooth and fluid os, simplistic but very user friendly, great camera, great nokia exclusive apps, great display with clearblack technology, great design and build quality, what else can i say, to summarize it, lumia should be the number one in phonedog's ranking. the only thing that ios and android devices are better is the volume of apps..

Home > Windows Phone Reviews > Nokia Lumia Icon. Sharp, bright and colorful full HD 5" display, fast quad core CPU, wireless charging.. What's Not: A little less stylish than other Lumia phones, no storage expansion slot. Windows phone app store still weaker than Android and iOS.. Reviewed March 23, 2014 by Lisa Gade , Editor. in Chief (twitter: @lisagade ). We loved the Nokia Lumia 1520 , and I personally said it was the best Windows phone that I would never use. Why? At 6", it was too big for me. Others who felt the same have patiently waited for Nokia to release a smartphone with the same cutting edge specs and 20MP PureView camera, but in a smaller package. Now we have it in the form of the Nokia Lumia Icon, a worldwide exclusive to Verizon Wireless.. The 5.9 ounce Nokia Lumia Icon has a 5" full HD Clear Black OLED display with outdoor brightness mode and heightened touch sensitivity for gloves but no Nokia Glance feature. Like the 1520 it runs on a 2.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad core CPU with Adreno 330 graphics and 2 gigs of RAM, giving it the same horsepower as top Android phones. It has 32 gigs of internal storage but no microSD card slot. The phone has dual band WiFi 802.11ac, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS and a front HD webcam. Qi wireless charging is built in- no need to buy a special charging back. The 20MP PureView camera that can shoot DNG RAW files? It's every bit as good as the excellent Lumia 1520 camera. And that makes it one of the top camera phones on the market, barring the 41MP Nokia Lumia 102 0. The Lumia Icon runs Windows Phone 8 (specifically the "Lumia Black" release).. The only place the Lumia Icon lets us down is looks. Lumia has been synonymous with unique and attractive styling, but the Icon looks a little boxy and dull. Somehow Nokia's Lumia models suffer on Verizon and we can only guess that carrier prefers staid looks and eschews zingy colors. The usually curvy Lumia design is squared off here, and in fact the sides are broad and flat enough that you can stand it on three of its four sides (the side with all the buttons won't work). The sides are unibody aluminum and the back is Nokia's usual matte polycarbonate, and the back has a gentle bulge. It looks like a quality piece. Verizon Wireless offers the phone in your choice of black or white for $199 on contract and $550 with no contract commitment.. This is a CDMA phone with 4G LTE on Verizon's network. It also has unlocked GSM world roaming with 2G and 3G but no LTE for GSM networks. Call quality on Verizon was decent but not stellar, Nokia excels at voice phones for GSM, but their CDMA (Verizon and Sprint use CDMA) call quality lacks the fullness and clarity of their top GSM phones. That's not to say your conversations will be an unintelligible mess--that's not the case. You just won't enjoy landline equivalent clarity and bass to treble range. Data speeds are par for the course on Verizon's solid 4G LTE network and the Lumia Icon matched current Android phones and the iPhone 5S for download and upload speeds according to the SpeedTest.net app.. HTC M8 for Windows Comparison Smackdown. We're fans of Nokia's OLED displays because they're sharp, bright and color saturated without looking cartoonish or garish in terms of color. This is a full HD 1920 x 1080 display, currently a rarity on Windows Phone but standard fare on higher end Android phones. In a word: "great"! Videos look superb with strong black levels and high contrast, photos shot with the camera look scrumptious and text is clear with no jaggies. The display has an outdoor viewable mode to combat brightness, and it is indeed legible outdoors. Like other Lumia phones you can enable enhanced sensitivity if you wish to use the phone with gloves.. Beyond the top notch CPU and speedy internals, the 20 megapixel camera with f/2.4 Carl Zeiss lens and dual LED flash steal the show. Granted, it's not as impressive as the Nokia Lumia 1020 and its 41MP shooter (nothing is), but it's better than most high end camera phones on the market. It has a larger sensor than most: 1/2.5 inch (0.40" diagonally) that's just a hair smaller than point-and-shoot dedicated digital cameras that commonly use a 1/2.3 sensor (0.43" diagonally). Like the Lumia 1020 and 1520, the Icon by default shoots a 5MP image and a full res 19MP image that you can use for print and lossless zooming via crop. The Lumia 1020's shot times didn't impress us, and even the Lumia 1520 could be faster, and the Lumia Icon only slightly improves shot times over these two. For example, autofocus speeds are tolerable though still not quick. As with other Lumia smartphones, you can use software lenses to achieve different effects, and you'll find these on the Windows app store for free. Nokia also includes their Cinemagraph, StoryTeller and Nokia Camera apps.. Video is crisp and clear, and we found the camera a more than adequate replacement for a point and shoot when taking photos and shooting video. You can shoot in your choice of 720 or 1080p at up to 30 fps. Nokia's high dynamic range microphones make much better than average stereo recording while shooting video and optical image stabilization keeps shaky video at bay without degrading video and image quality as digital stabilization sometimes does.. The Nokia has a 2420 mAh Lithium Ion battery that's sealed inside. That's a similar capacity to Android smartphones running on the same CPU with a 5" full HD display, so we expected similar runtimes. Indeed, like the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One , the Lumia Icon easily made it through a full day of moderate use with 25% left at 11pm. We used the web browser, email, social networking, played an hour of music with the display off, watched an hour of streaming video via Netflix, navigated a 5 mile trip with the GPS and shot 20 photos. We expect gaming to drain the battery more quickly, but in the Lumia Icon's case, shooting lots of photos and video will also drain the battery quickly.. You know the story: Windows Phone's app store selection is weak compared to Android and iOS, and that's something to keep in mind if you're a software junky looking to defect from those platforms. But the built-in programs like Microsoft's mobile MS Office suite, XBOX music, a strong PIM suite and social networking, MS Exchange support and a very good mobile IE web browser take core of core needs. Most of the top apps are available on Windows Phone, but some popular apps are still missing and the game selection is decent, but different from Android and iOS in terms of titles available. That said, I've managed to find apps to cover my needs with a few exceptions like my favorite grocery shopping list (Grocery IQ) and remote camera control and transfer apps from the likes of Canon and Sony.. The phone can sync with Google services for contacts, calendar and gmail, though push gmail went away when Google dropped Exchange ActiveSync support from free gmail accounts. POP and IMAP email are supported natively and as you'd guess MS Exchange works fine. The phone can use Microsoft's OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) cloud services for easy access to all manner of files including MS Office documents, photos and videos.. Looks aside, this is Nokia's best Lumia yet, unless you're a serious camera buff who lusts for the Nokia Lumia 1020. The Lumia Icon brings a full HD display, cutting edge CPU and graphics and an excellent camera to Windows Phone, and despite my aesthetic complaints, it looks and feels like a well made phone. If you're a Verizon customer and are interested in trying Windows Phone or upgrading, the Nokia Lumia Icon is easy to recommend.. Price: $199 with 2 year contract, $550 without contract.

Nokia’s Lumia Icon: A Nice Windows Phone for Verizon with a Surprisingly Clunky Camera. Laggy shooting mars an otherwise impressive handset.. By Harry McCracken @harrymccracken Feb. Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Delicious Google+. In Androidland, there are so many manufacturers pumping out so many phones that there’s something for everybody. With the iPhone, there’s just Apple , a company which likes to keep things simple — it was big news last fall when it went from one model to two.. Though multiple companies make handset that run Microsoft ‘s mobile operating system, the dominant one by far is Nokia — which, barring any last-moment shocker, is about to sell its entire phone business to Microsoft. Lately, it’s been producing a profusion of Lumia models: cheap phones, upscale phones, big phones, small phones, different phones for different carriers. It’s Android-like diversity, all from one company.. Nokia’s announcing its newest model, the Lumia Icon , today. This one’s exclusive to Verizon, where it’ll go on sale on February 20 for $200 on a two-year contract, the going rate for a well-appointed smartphone. It’s a high-end-but-mainstream model — the sort you might gravitate towards if you were also considering an iPhone 5s or Samsung Galaxy S 4.. The screen is a 5-incher, which once would have been considered ginormous, but now, with the existence of the 6-inch Lumia 1520 and 1320, merely counts as nice and roomy. As with other Lumias, the display is wrapped in a classy polycarbonate shell; like an iPhone, it’s all sealed up, without a removable battery or a slot for additional storage beyond the standard 32GB. The angles are more sharply defined than with most Lumias, with a metal band around the circumference forming a real edge rather than the back tapering into a curve. As with any phone this big, it’s a bit of a handful.. If you’ve read this far, I assume you’re an open-minded sort who’s willing to at least consider spurning an iPhone or Android model in favor of Windows Phone 8, which is still very much an underdog among smartphone operating systems. Its tile-centric interface looks great on the Icon, which has a 1920-by-1080 OLED screen, a 2.2-GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and 2GB of RAM. In concert, they make for a vivid, fluid, fast and fun experience.. Though the Icon doesn’t share the Lumia 1020 ‘s super-high-end camera, it does play up its photographic features, which Nokia promotes with the PureView brand. The 20-megapixel sensor offers pixels aplenty, but by default, the camera gives you images in a more space-efficient 5-megapixel form; the big advantage of the additional pixels is that you can zoom in by up to 3X magnification without the resulting picture being a blocky eyesore. (Serious shutterbugs can transfer 16-megapixel versions to a computer via USB cable, and even shoot in uncompressed RAW format, just like with an SLR camera.). Here are some of the pictures I’ve snapped in the brief time I’ve had to try out the phone — click them to see them at full resolution:. I was pretty pleased with the photos and videos I shot, but still found the camera less than delightful. By current standards, it’s decidedly laggy for still images: You can’t just rifle off shots with virtually no lag, as you can with an iPhone 5s or 5c or any number of Android models. After you’ve snapped a picture, there’s a distracting iris-out effect — like you’d see at the end of a Looney Tune — which makes the whole process feel even more sluggish. And though there’s a dedicated physical shutter button you can press to launch the camera even if the phone is locked, it takes several seconds to wake the phone from its slumber.. Besides Windows Phone’s standard Camera and Phone apps, the Icon comes with something called Nokia Pro Cam, which you’ll want to update through the Windows Store to a newer version called Nokia Camera. It’s a solid app, with niceties such as the ability to zoom by swiping with your thumb so you can shoot with one hand, plus more advanced settings than the smartphone norm. But a bunch of other photo- and video-related features are scattered through other Nokia-only apps, including Nokia Cinemagraph, Nokia Creative Studio, Nokia Storyteller and Nokia Video Trimmer. For instance, if you want to blur backgrounds for a fake Lytro effect, you use Creative Studio; to browse photos by the location where they were shot, you head to Storyteller.. It’s a disjointed experience, especially since Windows Phone’s standard Camera and Photos apps are still around, too. At some point after Microsoft swallows up Nokia’s phone operations, I assume it’ll take a hard look at all of Nokia’s apps and weave the best features in with Windows Phone’s existing capabilities. The result will be more coherent phones…or so I’d like to think.. The clunky camera is a shame, since so many other things about the Icon are so nice. There are four — count ’em, four — microphones, which help the Icon strip out background noise when you record a video or talk on the phone. The speakers can produce louder music than the average smartphone, with fidelity that’s good enough that you might actually want to listen to it. As with most other Lumias, the Icon supports wireless charging, and the $80 Fatboy pillow is the coolest way I’ve seen to do it: You just plop the phone down for a rest at night.. The Nokia Icon is the best Windows Phone for Verizon, no doubt. Assuming you’re willing to consider a Microsoft-powered handset, it deserves your attention. (The biggest downside is still that the Windows Store’s offerings fall so short of what’s available for iOS and Android, though with the recent arrival of holdouts such as Instagram, that’s become less of a dealbreaker.) But whether it carries the Nokia logo or the Microsoft one, I hope that there’s a future phone with all of the Icon’s virtues — and a much snappier camera..

For Verizon users who are onboard with what Windows Phone has to offer, the Lumia Icon is a no-brainer purchase. With its gorgeous display, sexy design, and powerful internals, the Icon oozes quality from every pore.. Comments (0) Discuss (4) Email Print. Rating 1 to 10, top score 10. Camera is good, but not on the level of past Lumias. It’s hard out there for a Windows Phone. Always fighting to scraps, taking what it can get, waving its hands for help as the rest of world floats away. It probably got picked last for kickball as a kid. Microsoft’s mobile OS is and has long been a solid third in the smartphone world, slowly growing a fanbase but never quite reeling in the hardware or software support it needs. In fact, until a few months ago, Nokia was famously the one company willing to commit to the outcast as it navigated through its growing pains.. That friendship is dead now, though, because Microsoft recently decided to buy its Finnish friends into its family instead. Today, the old Nokia has been subsumed by a substitute-to-be-named-later that looks, well, like the old Nokia. There’ve been some experiments , yeah, but generally speaking Nokia (by Microsoft) is still pumping out the same kind of Windows Phones on the regular. All the while, Windows Phone itself is still huffing and puffing as Google and Apple happily jaunt their way to the bank. The Lumia Icon, then, has become something of a landmark in hindsight. One of the last flagship phones released by Nokia before it became New Nokia, the Icon feels a culmination of the three years of toil its makers spent trying to get Windows Phone over the top. It picks and plucks the best features of its many predecessors, throws them into a body that refuses to compromise on aesthetics, and powers everything up with modernized hardware. It is the best Windows Phone your money can buy. But therein lies its problem, like it always has. Let’s take a look at the Icon, which is available now through Verizon.. Most modern flagships strive for pragmatism in their designs. The Samsung Galaxy S5 , LG G3 , HTC One (M8) — expensive phones like these are composed of vastly different materials and feel nothing alike in the hand, but all of them try to find a balance between style and comfort.. The Lumia Icon, on the other hand, doesn’t care about your dumb hands. It’s got a vision — to be a cold, miniature black (or silver) monolith — and it’s sticking to it. If its super sharp angles have to jut into your palms to keep its look consistent, so be it. If its hard, straight lines don’t round out and contort to your hands, too bad. Like past Lumias, this is a phone with a commitment to aesthetics. There’s something very noble about that.. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that all of this is built with such fine materials. The Icon’s soft, barely curved polycarbonate back is about as premium as phone plastic gets, and its cool aluminum edges are both sturdy and smooth to the touch. The same can be said about its entirely Gorilla Glass 3 front, which curves ever so slightly at its edges and makes swiping around a pleasure. Things like the 20-megapixel rear camera and four built-in microphones are implemented into the device without bulging out or making themselves obvious.. Still, this is a hard rectangle, and that isn’t the most accommodating shape. The Icon is unapologetically thick (9.38 mm), and it’s heavy (167 g) to the point of distraction. It bulges out of your pocket like a mutated pack of gum. Those sharp angles digging into your hands can become an annoyance after a while. Its sense of style is appreciated, but the Icon’s elegance also necessitates a lack of comfort.. There are other nits to pick. The dedicated shutter button and removable nano-SIM tray are genuinely convenient, but neither are implemented as well as they could be. The former is looser than the otherwise fine volume rocker and power button, and the latter requires a pick or some grown fingernails to pry open. Nokia’s once again put the headphone jack on the top of the device, and that’s still a terrible idea. Finally, Verizon’s branding is a distraction, per usual, mucking up real estate on both the front and rear of the device.. We’re in the midst of a renaissance period for smartphone displays, and the Lumia Icon’s gorgeous 5-inch panel is amongst the industry’s best. It’s of the AMOLED variety, with a 1080p resolution that’s good for a super sharp 441 pixels per inch. Colors are deep and vivid, and as we’ve come to expect from other OLED screens, blacks are dark like the abyss, almost blending right in with the phone’s slim bezels.. Unlike rival OLED displays, though, the Icon’s screen is exceptionally bright by default, and it isn’t dragged down by an overarching hue of blue. (Keen eyes will see some slight blues when viewing all-white backgrounds from the side, but that’s about it.) Combine that with top-tier viewing angles, the ability to manually adjust color temperature, and Nokia’s successful “ClearBlack” anti-glare tech, and you have one of the best Windows Phone panels to date. The only real quibble is that the glass picks up smudges from time to time, but those aren’t visible once the display is up and running. Outside of that, this is a joy to behold..
