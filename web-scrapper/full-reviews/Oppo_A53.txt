The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. Some processors have a level 0 cache memory, which is accessed quicker than the L1, L2, L3, and so one cache memories. Besides achieving better performance, it also consumes less power.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications.

Jagoan baru dai vendor asal Negeri Tirai Bambu itu adalahÂ. Oppo A53 yang merupakan produk terbaru Oppo setelah seri Oppo R. Tak seperti vendor lain yang sangat agresif dalam menghadirkan produk-produk baru,Â. memang Oppo ini merupakan produsen yang cukup santai dalam merilis produk-produk barunya. Pelan tapi pasti, inilah strategi yang Oppo gunakan untuk menarik konsumen. Sebagai model paling gres yang dihadirkan, Oppo A53 tentu saja membawakan spesifikasi yang lebih baik juga modern. Seperti seri ponsel pintar sebelum-sebelumnya, Oppo juga selalu menghadirkan varian ponsel pintar dengan bodi yang cukup ramping sehingga memberikan kenyamanan yang maksimal pada penggunanya.

Dengan kinerja yang ditenagai oleh prosesor Octa-core 1.5 GHz yang didukung RAM berkapasitas 2 GB. tentu saja akan smartphone ini juga akan memberikan kinerja yang mumpuni serta multitasking dipastikan akan berjalan secara lancar. Untuk sebuah ponsel pintar kelas menengah atas, dukungan hardware yang pada Oppo A53 tersebut memang telah nyaris setara dengan spesifikasi yang dimiliki oleh ponsel pintar kelas premium. Selain itu, seperti halnya ponsel modern yang lain, ponsel cerdas yang satu ini telah dibekali dengan perangkat kamera yang juga berkemampuan tinggi untuk menghasilkan jepretan dengan kualitas terbaik. Perangkat kamera yang disematkan pada Oppo A53 yaitu sebesar 13 MP dan sudah dilengkapi dengan fitur-fitur canggih. Untuk saat ini, memang masih belum dipastikan tepatnya kapan ponsel pintar ini akan rilis dan dipasarkan di Indonesia atau tidak. Oppo A53 ini akan mulai dipasarkan pada bulan November ini, namun itu untuk pasar global. Nah untuk mengetahui kualitas sesungguhnya sebelum kehadirannya di Tanah Air, Begawei sudah menyiapkan ulasan lengkap mengenai spesifikasi dan hargaÂ. Oppo A53 pada segmen-segmen di bawah ini. Smartphone Entry Level dengan Display Visual Berkualitas Tinggi. Seperti biasanya, kita akan mulai ulasan spesifikasi Oppo A53 dari sektor yang paling kasat mata, yaitu bagian fisik. Apabila kita perhatikan, desain smartphone terbaru Oppo seri A53 ini memang sangat kental beraroma Oppo R7 yang merupakan perangkat papan atas. Dari tampilan depan hingga lekukan sudutnya, sekilas memangÂ. Oppo A53 ini sangat identik dengan Oppo R7. Secara fisik, smartphone ini memiliki dimensi berukuranÂ. 131.9 x 65.5 x 8.0 mm dengan bobot mencapai 165 gram. Ukuran tubuh seperti itu membuat smartphone ini terlihat kompak meski bodinya berukuran cukup bongsor.Â. mengusung jenis layar IPS LCD berukuran 5.5 inci. Bentangan layar yang sangat luas ini pastinya akan menyajikan ruang kerja yang longgar serta lebih nyaman. Layar seluas 5.5 inci pada smartphone ini memiliki resolusi sebesarÂ. 1280 x 720 pixels dengan kerapatan layar mencapaiu 267 ppi. Berbekal resolusi dan kerapatan yang tinggi ini pula,Â. Oppo A53 akan menyajikan tampilan visual yang jernih dan memanjakan mata penggunanya. Untuk ukuran smartphone kelas pemula, kualitas visual yang ada pada smartphone terbaru dari Oppo ini memang menjadi salah satu yang terbaik di kelasnya. Oppo A53 ini adalah belum adanya sistem proteksi layar sekelas Gorilla Glass atau Dragontrail. So, kawan Begawei harus menambahkan screen guard secara manual untuk melindungi layarnya.. Performa Handal Ditenagai oleh Chipset Snapdragon 615 dan Prosesor Octa-core. Setelah kita mengetahui seperti apa bodi dan juga display visualnya, sekarang saatnya kita membedah bagian dalam dari spesifikasi Oppo A53 ini. Sektor atau bagian dalam yang akan kita ulas pertama kali adalah dapur pacunya. Sebagai smartphone kelas menengah, Oppo A53Â. ini dibekali dengan komponen-komponen mesin yang cukup tangguh. Pada bagian inti mesin, Oppo menyematkan chipset Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 yang berkekuatan prosesor Octa-core dengan kecepatan akses mencapai 1.5 GHz. Seperti kita ketahui, chipset yang tertanam padaÂ. Oppo A53 ini merupakan salah satu chipset papan atas besutan Qualcomm. Jadi, sobat Begawei tak perlu ragu lagi akan kualitas dan kinerja mesin pada smartphone ini.Â. Kinerja mesin Oppo A53 pun juga didukung oleh RAM berkapasitas 2 GB. Dengan bekal komponen-komponen yang sangat berkualitas tersebut, smartphone ini akan menghadirkan performa yang tangguh dan kinerja optimal. Namun sayangnya, hingga kini Oppo sendiri belum membeberkan jenis kartu pengolah grafis atau GPU yang akan ditanamkan pada produk barunya ini. Satu hal yang sudah pasti, semua komponen hardware pada spesifikasiÂ. Oppo A53 ini akan berjalan pada sistem operasi Android OS versi 5.1 atau dikenal juga dengan OS Android Lollipop. Keberadaan OS canggih ini pastinya akan membuat smartphone ini semakin seru untuk digunakan.. Memori On-board Hadir dengan Kapasitas 16 GB. Sekarang saatnya kita membahas spesifikasi Oppo A53 pada sektor internal memory-nya. Keberadaan ruang penyimpanan file atau memori pada suatu perangkat memang sangat penting. Hal ini karena memori sendiri juga berhubungan dengan sistem pada bagian dapur pacunya.Â. Selain dapur pacunya yang memiliki performa tangguh berkat hadirnya komponen-komponen berkualitas, Oppo A53Â. juga dibekali dengan komponen terbaik di sektor ruang penyimpanan file-nya. Tercatat, Oppo membekali produk smartphone terbarunya ini dengan memori internal berkapasitas 16 GB. Ruang seluas 16 GB yang disediakan oleh Oppo A53Â. pastinya akan cukup untuk menampung file-file sistem serta file-file aplikasi yang digunakan oleh penggunanya. Selain memori internal yang cukup luas, Oppo A53 juga dilengkapi dengan slot external memory yang bisa digunakan untuk mengekspansi memori pada smartphone ini hingga mencapai kapasitas 128 GB. Oppo A53 ini tentunya akan semakin menambah kemudahan bagi penggunanya dalam menyimpan file-file penting.. Maksimal Berkekuatan Duet Kamera 13 MP dan 5 MP. Oppo A53 ini masih menggunakan basis komponen fotografi yang sama dengan seri Oppo R7. menghadirkan duet kamera dengan kualitas tinggi, yakni kamera utama yang berada di bagian belakang ponsel dengan ukuran 13 MP. Kamera utama Oppo A53 tersebut mampu memberikan resolusi sebesar 4128 x 3096 pixels. Selain itu, kamera itu juga sudah dilengkapi dengan fitur LED Flash dan juga Autofocus yang akan membantu kawan Begawei dalam menghasilkan jepretan foto yang sangat berkualitas. Lalu, kamera utama Oppo A53 juga dibekali dengan fitur-fitur fotografi menarik lainnya, seperti Geotagging, Autofocus, FHD Recording (1080p), dan juga fitur 30 Frames per second. Fitur-fitur yang ada pada kamera Oppo A53 tersebut akan memberikan efek menarik pada hasil gambar atau video yang diambil. Untuk fasilitas video recording, Oppo A53 ini memiliki kemampuan perekaman video 1080 piksel pada 30 fps. Keunggulan fotografi smartphone ini juga didukung oleh kamera sekunder atau kamera depan dengan ukuran 8 MP. Oppo A53 pada bagian fotografi tak sekeren smartphone kelas premium, namun keberadaannya sudah sangat fungsional dalam membantu kawan Begawei untuk mengabadikan momen-momen berharga.. Jaminan Koneksi Internet Kencang Berkat Teknologi 4G LTE. Berbicara soal modernisasi, salah satu kebutuhan yang tak bisa dipisahkan dari sebuah gadget adalah teknologi konektivitasnya. Hal ini karena pengguna gadget cenderung memilih perangkat dengan spesifikasi konektivitas yang lengkap. Oppo A53 pada bagian konektivitas pun hadir dengan kemampuan terbaik.Â. Meski hanya ditempatkan sebagai smartphone kelas menengah, nyatanya Oppo A53 hadir dengan mengusung teknologi jaringan data terbaik. Kawan Begawei membutuhkan akses internet cepat? Smartphone inilah jawabannya. Smartphone terbaru dari Oppo ini memang memberikan akses internet yang lancar karena memiliki teknologi jaringan utama 4G LTE sebagai koneksi utamanya. Apalagi, Oppo A53 ini juga memiliki dua slot SIM card yang bisa diaktifkan secara bersamaan.

Sedangkan untuk keperluan transfer data jarak dekat, smartphone ini juga telah memiliki fitur Bluetooth serta slot microUSB. pada sektor konektivitas ini juga telah dibekali dengan teknologi navigasi A-GPS yang pastinya bisa digunakan untuk menentukan letak suatu tempat.. Setelah memberedeli seluruh sektor yang ada, sekarang saatnya kita membahas spesifikasiÂ. Oppo A53 pada bagian pamasok daya alias baterai. Kapasitas atau besaran daya pada baterai juga merupakan masalah yang cukup penting. Semakin besar kapasitas baterainya, tentu semakin baik karena semua sistem akan bisa bekerja optimal sepanjang hari. Oppo A53 ini memang tergolong smartphone yang memiliki konsumsi daya cukup besar. Hal ini karena komponen-komponen hardware yang ada di dalamnya merupakan komponen berkualitas tinggi. Salah satu contoh bagian yang membutuhkan pasokan daya cukup tinggi adalah dapur pacunya. Selain itu, layar dan sistem koneksi padaÂ. Oppo A53 pun juga membutuhkan pasokan daya yang cukup besar. Namun sayangnya, hingga kini pihak Oppo pun belum mengumumkan jenis baterai serta berapa kapasitas yang akan digunakan pada produk terbarunya ini. Jika melihat tren yang dibawa Oppo, kemungkinan besar memangÂ. Oppo A53 ini akan tetap ditenagai oleh baterai yang berkapasitas mencukupi, sesuai dengan kebutuhan dayanya. Selain itu, ada kabar bahwa Oppo akan menggunakan teknologi Quick Charging pada spesifikasiÂ. Oppo A53 di bagian pemasok dayanya. Jika ini benar, maka tentu saja akan menjadi kelebihan bagi smartphone terbaru dari Oppo ini.. Dari ulasan di atas, bisa ditarik kesimpulan bahwa Oppo A53 ini memang didesain secara khusus untuk mereka yang membutuhkan ponsel berkualitasÂ. ini memiliki keunggulan-keunggulan yang patut diperhitungkan, meski ada sedikit pula catatan kecil dari spesifikasinya. Soal kelebihan, kita pantas menyebut bagian layar serta spesifikasi mesinnya. Meski memiliki kekurangan dengan tanpa adanya sistem proteksi layar, namun secara keseluruhan memang smartphone ini memiliki kualitas yang sangat baik.Â. Nah, untuk lebih mengetahui kelebihan Oppo A53Â. kekurangan Oppo A53, Begawei hadirkan ringkasannya dalam tabel berikut ini:. Bagaimana? Sudah puas dengan ulasan lengkap spesifikasi serta kelebihan dan kekurangan produk baru dari Oppo ini? Jika kawan Begawei sudah puas dengan ulasan lengkap spesifikasinya, sekaranga saatnya masuk ke segmen harga Oppo A53 yang menurut rencana akan mulai dipasarkan di Indonesia pada akhir tahunÂ. Jika kita melihat spesifikasinya, jelas Oppo A53Â. ini memang sangat memenuhi kebutuhan ponsel pintar pengguna pemula atau kelas menengah.Â. Dengan bekal layar 5.5 inci, maka smartphone ini akan sangat pas bagi kamu yang menghendaki smartphone berlayar lebar dengan kualitas visual mumpuni. Pun demikian halnya dengan sektor dapur pacunya. ini memang dibanderol sebanding dengan spesifikasi mesinnya yang mengusung chipset Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 berkekuatan CPU Octa-core 1.5 GHz.Â. Kemudian sektor dapur smartphone ini pun masih ditambah lagi kekuatannya olehÂ. Selain itu, sektor kamera yang dibawakan juga telah memenuhi standar ponsel modern kelas menengah ke atas untuk menghasilkan gambar dan video yang maksimal. Tak lupa pula dengan dukungan konektivitas terbaik 4G LTE. Nah dengan bekal spesifikasi kelas atas tersebut, kira-kira hargaÂ. Oppo A53 sendiri secara resmi memang belum diumumkan, mengingat kehadirannya di Indonesia memang masih sebatas rumor. Namun dari beberapa informasi yang Begawei dapatkan dari sumber terpercaya, banderol hargaÂ. Oppo A53 ini akan berkisar pada angka Rp 3 jutaan.Â. Kisaran harga tersbut memang masih berupa perkiraan sementara hingga menunggu Oppo secara resmi memberikan pengumuman. Jika melihat pangsa pasar smartphone di Tanah Air, perkiraan harga di atas memang bisa saja terjadi. Hal ini mengingat tren smartphone kelas menengah bawah buatan Oppo yang biasanya dibanderol dengan range harga antara Rp 1,5 hingga Rp 3 jutaan. Oppo A53 ini pun sebenarnya sudah sesuai dengan spesifikasi yang dibawanya. Untuk ukuran smartphone entry level, spesifikasi yang dihadirkan oleh Oppo lewat produk terbarunya ini memang sudah cukup bagus. Jadi sangat wajar jika akhirnya hargaÂ. Oppo A53 akan jatuh sebagai yang tertinggi untuk level smartphone kelas pemula..

Sebelumnya, memang banyak vendor yang sudah merilis produk-produk ponsel pintar untuk segmen entry level.Â. Nah, bagi kawan Begawei yang membutuhkan partner gadget berlayar lebar dan berteknologi 4G LTE, kisaran harga Oppo A53Â. yang cukup bersahabat tadi pastinya merupakan pilihan yang sangat bagus.

Probably will cost $400 usd, just like the HTC A9, seeing as how both of these companies feel their supposed build quality warrants these kinds of price tags. None of the phones produced today really warrant anything over $450 usd, it's just that the companies need to make back all that advertising and branding cost. They can profit at those types of prices, it's just that they spend so much on superficial things, as well as sheep's willingness to gut their bank accounts, they say to themselves "why not?".
