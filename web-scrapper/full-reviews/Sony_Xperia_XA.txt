The Good With a super-skinny bezel, the Sony Xperia XA is a great-looking phone that's comfortable to use in one hand.. The Bad Its low screen resolution, short-lived battery and meagre amount of built-in storage are major setbacks. Sony has loaded the phone with a horrible mess of bloatware.. The Bottom Line Unless slick style is your only concern, skip the Sony Xperia XA for a cheaper phone with better features.. Edgeless screen 143.6 by 66.8 by 7.9 mm 137 grams (4.83 ounces) Tiny bezel around the display. Sony Xperia XA spec comparison chart. Clean software, with too much bloatware Android 6.0 Marshmallow Lots of preloaded bloatware 64-bit, octa-core processor. Sony's recent phones, such as the Xperia X , have been too blocky to be called truly stylish. Not so with the Xperia XA. This 5-inch phone has an edge-to-edge display with only the merest sliver of a bezel. It gives the XA a lusciously premium look that belies its affordable price tag.. The XA will set you back $280 in the US, £240 in the UK and AU$499 in Australia. Design this slick is not usually a high priority for phones of this price.. But that's where my positive feelings for this phone end. The price is still too steep for its low-resolution display and unimpressive specs, especially when you compare it to the cheaper and more powerful Motorola Moto G4 Plus .. Yes, the XA has a cool design, but it comes at a too high a price.. The almost total lack of edge around the sides of the screen strikes you immediately. It doesn't curve at the side like the Galaxy S7 Edge. It gives it a classy look. It makes the XA feel smaller than you might expect from a 5-inch phone. I could comfortably stretch my thumb across the display to type with just one hand and it slid easily into my pocket.. The screen itself is a letdown, though. It has only a 720p resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 293 pixels per inch, which is low for a phone of this size and price. The Moto G4 Plus costs significantly less, but it packs a full HD panel with a much more impressive 401 ppi. While apps such as Twitter and Facebook look fine, small text is fuzzy and high resolution images lack clarity.. Colours don't impress, either, and the display is not very bright. Though Sony was able to squash the screen into a small space, it picked the wrong screen to squash in.. The back panel is plastic, but my white model had a pearlescent finish that glints with a pinkish sheen when it catches the light. Hardly a killer feature, but it's a welcome touch and a key element of the XA's aesthetic appeal.. What you won't find on the phone is a fingerprint scanner, which is disappointing given that most of Sony's recent phones, like the Xperia X, have it. It's yet another point where the cheaper Moto G4 Plus wins out. If Motorola can add a fingerprint scanner without ramping up the price, why can't Sony? Without a scanner, you'll have to type in your PIN at the terminal when using Android Pay, for example. That's just not as fast and easy as using your finger.. Apple A9 chip (64-bit) with M9 motion co-processor. Notifications toggle, dual-SIM, Dash Charging. The XA runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow, largely untampered with -- thank you, Sony, for not adding a special skin. That makes it easy to use for Android experts and novices alike.. What Sony has done, though, is load the phone up with a whole mess of software right out of the box. Beyond its own PlayStation app, there's an Xperia Lounge app and something called What's New (confusingly, all have different curated lists of games, music, movies and so on). There's a handful of third-party apps too, including AVG antivirus, the Kobo ebooks app and Amazon's shopping app.. The few widgets preinstalled on the home screen also make the phone feel somewhat cluttered from the first time you switch it on. Thankfully, you can uninstall some of them, but it's a tedious process that you should be spared.. It's particularly annoying that the XA comes with a very limited 16GB of internal storage, of which fully 6GB is taken up by the Android system files and preinstalled nonsense. You'll absolutely want to use the microSD card slot to save your images, videos and music as you'll eat up the on-board space very quickly.. The XA runs on a 64-bit octa-core processor, which delivers enough power to make swiping around the Android interface a smooth experience. Apps open quickly and photo editing in Snapseed, for example, is smooth. It copes with gaming reasonably well -- both Asphalt 8 and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas were playable, although frame rates noticeably dipped in more intense moments. Less demanding games such as Candy Crush will play fine.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges..

Android - Android + Sony - Sony +. 1 Introduction, Design and Display. 2 Interface, Performance and Connectivity. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction The Sony Xperia XA is a new and affordable 5-inch Android phone that aims to win your attention with its eye-catchy looks and futuristic, edge-to-edge display. Powered by the Helio P10 system chip that is often used in even more affordable phones out of China, the Xperia XA is no performance beast, nor does it claim to have a ground-breaking camera or amaze with battery life. Apart from the wow-inducing edge-to-edge screen , this really is your run-of-the-mill Android phone that does not seem to stand out with anything else at first look. Is it really so? And is the Xperia XA worth your attention? Join us as we dive in the specifics to find out. In the box: Sony Xperia XA Wall charger MicroUSB to USB cable User manual Design The edge-to-edge screen looks impressive and cool, and a metal frame is nice to have. The Sony Xperia XA is a fairly good-looking phone and its cool edge-to-edge screen is the one feature that makes it stand out among its rivals. The slightly tapered towards the edges screen makes it easier for your finger to glide along the glass surface, and this type of design also makes side bezel almost non-existent, so that the phone can be very narrow and more compact. We don’t think this is a game-changer in any way, but such an edge-to-edge screen is nonetheless a nice feature to have. It's great to look at, for sure. The handset also comes in four fresh colors: white, black, lime gold and rose gold. Тhe Xperia XA features a plastic frame and a plastic back cover, but we think it still feels nice and, unlike trendy glass surfaces, it is not a fingerprint magnet. Disappointingly, there is no fingerprint scanner on the Xperia XA. Fingerprint security has become the de facto security standard for our phones, so it’s a real pity that Sony has decided not to equip its XA with a fingerprint reader. Just in case you’re wondering, the handset also lacks any form of special water protection. Display The 5” 720p display on the Xperia XA is not the worst, but it has cold and oversaturated colors that are not well balanced. The Xperia XA features a 5” display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. At this resolution, you can see a bit of pixelization and the screen does not look perfectly sharp. Colors are also far from perfect: whites appear annoyingly bluish, and colors on the whole are way overblown and not well balanced. Why is this important? Simple: it makes all the colors in images and video appear different from what their creators intended them to look like. On a more positive note, the screen does get quite bright and is legible even under direct sunlight. Viewing angles are not bad, as well, as brightness is retained at different angles.. 5.65 x 2.63 x 0.31 inches. 143.6 x 66.8 x 7.9 mm. 5.79 x 2.86 x 0.31 inches. 147 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm. 5.7 x 2.8 x 0.29 inches. 144.8 x 71 x 7.3 mm. 5.91 x 2.99 x 0.34 inches. 150 x 76 x 8.65 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Sony Xperia XA Compare.

All the three phones in the X series are of the same size and design offering nothing different except the internals which the average consumer couldn't care less about. I hope they bring new set of phones this fall. This could be their very last chance.. (Posts: 1256; Member since: 15 Apr 2016). posted on 11 Jul 2016, 09:32. I turned off ABP just to comment on this. I wanted to make a note that the version that B&H Photo is selling has support for bands 12 and 17, so the point on LTE isn't fully correct. That aside, the review has made me so sad. I had the 5x, which was cool but felt too tall for me and the fact that the XA sucks is a bummer. I was waiting for this phone, seems like I was waiting to be disappointed. I'm waiting on 2 more reviews from my other tech sites before I decide to throw in the towel. I really wanted it to be a little 5" screen savior because sometimes my hands get tired from holding a 5.2" phone. The pricing seemed to be right originally, but seeing that this is the performance and that the 5x has better battery life over this.

If it doesn't have the bands I need, it will be dead for me. I like my Robin a lot but sometimes I get tired of holding it and would like something smaller. Edit: I checked it out and the bands suck for the USA. (Posts: 751; Member since: 07 May 2014). posted on 13 Jul 2016, 19:36.

They will prosper, but losing T Mobile in US very bad. There were the M4 and M5 as cheaper models, before Z3+, Z4. This phone will help SONY sell in countries where cheaper needed. This Commenter Libra89 states above, there are models with LTE support,. (Posts: 437; Member since: 02 Oct 2015). posted on 11 Jul 2016, 09:37. That was a pretty low score.

I like the that signature look of their phones, contrary to other people's complaints of "same old design". But Sony has really dug out the last pile of dirt out of their grave hole this time. Sony Mobile can just die now. (Posts: 436; Member since: 18 May 2016). posted on 11 Jul 2016, 11:14. Sony made the biggest mistake of using the MTK Helio P10. They should follow Asus doing a trio SD... SD 625 for mid, SD 652 mid-high & SD 820 high end. (FYI, Asus Zenfone 3 with SD 625 has a 60K Antutu score, more than this 40K+ antutu of Helio P10). (Posts: 808; Member since: 17 Oct 2011). posted on 11 Jul 2016, 11:30. Sony just can no longer compete in the mobile phone segment. All the phones they release are going to be compared to the cheaper but better specs Chinese phones and they will lose all the time. I am a Sony fan but maybe it's time to close shop if they have no answer to the fast rising Chinese phonemakers or else they will just continue to bleed.. (Posts: 1867; Member since: 16 Jan 2011). posted on 11 Jul 2016, 18:08. In Australia, I'd compare this to say an Oppo F1 - but I'd chose the Oppo because it's $200 cheaper than the Sony XA, and with essentially the same specs (720p screen, etc)... (Posts: 202; Member since: 15 Nov 2015). posted on 11 Jul 2016, 11:51. I don't agree with phone arena about the camera being not good. I saw many reviews on YouTube. Everyone reviewer says camera is better than Samsung J7 2016. I must say battery life is hopeless. The top bezel should have been little smaller. And ofcourse it is stupid really not to have used atleast snapdragon 617. No custom roms atleast like m4 aqua. I am looking forward to buy a secondary phone for normal use.i wanted the XA. But seems like i will buy M5 ot Zenaphone.3.. (Posts: 202; Member since: 15 Nov 2015). posted on 11 Jul 2016, 11:55. The display offers same amoled like display quality on a lcd. Then PA has to brand every Samsung Galaxy phone to have unrealistic colors. I would have given a 6.5. Btw sony said Xperia XA and E5 have a battery life bug on marshmallow. They will fix it they told.. (Posts: 18; Member since: 05 Apr 2012). posted on 11 Jul 2016, 13:05. I own this phone, And I disagree with PA on several aspects. The Camera- Apart from some cold looking pics, the camera is actually very good. Video is Normal and could have been better. The sound from speakers is not loud but its way better with the quality than iphone when I compared it(Believe me it is true). Call reception is also much much better and comparable to iphone (6s). Display ?? Well Iphone seems a joke in front of it. Yes iphone was better with the Gamma Values but was way yellowish with the whites and no options to correct it(atleast you could set the temperature with your own) and XA looked much livelier and better. Battery life is joke though, and iphone easily managed to beat it. Now for the PA's part, I know this is a serious allegation, but I believe PA actually bashes Sony too hard and praises iphone like they are paying for the praises. I have certainly noticed that Sony always had some better Mid to High end models that could even beat the flagships from other companies. But its a pattern that PA never reviews those phones and Skips them for good (Be it Xperia M5, Xperia C5, Xperia E4) and now they did reviewed XA, their review contradicts with every other reviews..

The Sony Xperia XA is slim and pocketable, but problems with performance and battery life mean there are better choices out there.. Sony Xperia XA price and availability Cheapest phone in Sony's newest Xperia X range Launch price: $279 (£229, AU$389) Current price: around $170 (£125, AU$225) Design One of the slimmest Sony phones ever at 7.9mm Edge-to-edge display gives it a unique look Don't dunk this phone - it's not waterproof. The Sony Xperia XA is one of the most accessible phones in the X-series line-up with an attractive price tag, slim design and strong selfie camera.. [Update: The Xperia XA price has dropped recently, making it an even better buy, but for those looking for something more recent it's worth noting that it has been succeeded by the equally as afforadable Xperia XA1 .]. When it comes to phones, mid-range is the new high-end.. Their cameras are already better than the knackered old Canon in the cupboard and you'll often be hard-pressed to notice the difference between a mid-level phone and a top-end one in day-to-day use.. While the Xperia XA may not hit all the high notes, it does offer a solid Android experience at a reasonable price.. The Xperia XA price launched at $279 (£229, AU$389), but we've seen the price drop down to around $170 (£125, AU$225).. That places the XA into a much more attractive budget price bracket, and with its spec sheet and edge-to-edge display it's one of the best looking low-cost smartphones around.. It sees the XA go up against the likes of the Moto G5 , Honor 6A and Moto E4 Plus , three other phones offering impressive spec sheets for a low cost.. The Sony Xperia XA has a design emerging as a common standard for mid-price phones out to avoid feeling cheap. It's a mostly-plastic device, with some bits of metal tacked-on.. There's a slight act of self-deception involved here. The idea is that because the sides of the Xperia XA are metal, you get some of that high-end feel while only using about 10 per cent of the more expensive materials.. While it's nowhere near as nice-feeling as a OnePlus 3 (not even close), the logic makes sense. Put the fancy-feeling bits by your fingertips, the most sensitive parts of your hands.. To get specific, only the left and right sides are aluminum. The top, the bottom and the back of the Xperia XA are all-plastic.. The other fancy part is the curved glass on top of the display. You'll often see this referred to as 2.5D glass, meaning its edges are rounded-off. It's not flat-out curved like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It softens the feel, but must come at barely any premium at all given how many cheaper phones use this glass.. Sony's burning of the Xperia Z branding with the new X range may make you think there are grand changes in this year's Sony phones, but there aren't. The Sony Xperia XA is formed of compacted Z-series ashes.. It's very slim, and has what Sony used to call an OmniBalance setup where the power button sits almost in the middle of the phone's side.. Weight: 137g Dimensions: 143.6 x 66.8 x 7.9mm OS: Android 6.0.1 Screen size: 5.0-inch Resolution: 720 x 1280 CPU: MediaTek Helio P10 RAM: 2GB Storage: 16GB Battery: 2300mAh Rear camera: 13MP Front camera: 8MP. Of course, many manufacturers do this nowadays so the obvious difference is that the Xperia XA has a round power button.. Among Xperia phones, what's neat about the Xperia XA is that its left/right screen surrounds are very, very skinny. In the past I've complained about Xperias being frankly not that nice to hold because of, variously, boxy designs, sharp seams and dimensions that come across better on paper than in person.. There are no such issues here, though.. Sure, it'd feel much skinnier if the shape wasn't essentially still a rectangular box, but the Sony Xperia XA is easy to handle.. Like most mid-range-and-higher phones these days, the Xperia XA has a non-removable back with a non-accessible battery. There's a flap on the side that covers the microSD and nanoSIM slots.. Unlike the Sony Xperia Z5 , there's no rubber seal on this flap so, whatever you do, don't drop the Xperia XA down the toilet, in your pint glass, etc. Sony has largely backed away from big waterproofing claims in its phones anyway, after one too many people found that their water resistance was less than infallible.. There aren't too many higher-end hardware extras either. There's no fingerprint scanner, for example, the latest "must-have" among ambitious mid-range designers like Honor, Motorola and OnePlus..

Press enter or click on the search icon. What is the Sony Xperia XA?. Sony is becoming irrelevant in the mobile space. Its high-end phones are increasingly dull and forgettable, highlighted by the recent Sony Xperia X , and it’s now falling behind in the mid-range space thanks to the OnePlus 3 , Moto G4 Plus and Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 .. Sony needs something new, something exciting. Is this the phone to make people care about the Japanese brand’s smartphone business?. Probably not, but it’s still a better buy than the Xperia X.. WATCH: Sony Xperia XA video review. The Xperia XA looks nicer than the more expensive Xperia X. While the boring Xperia X pales into middle-of-the-road territory, the Xperia XA has a spark that differentiates it from most budget phones.. It’s the near edge-to-edge display that really catches the eye. It’s nowhere near as pronounced as the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , but it’s a design choice rarely seen in the lower end of the phone market.. It looks good, but it also makes the phone feel very compact. It nestles easily in one hand and my thumb can move around the 5-inch display without too much stretching. With so few smaller phones on the market, it instantly makes the Xperia XA more of an enticing prospect to those who don’t want something with a 5.5- or 5.7-inch screen. It’s not as pocketable as the dinky iPhone SE , but it’s about as close as you can get to one running Android.. It’s light, too, probably because metal is kept to a minimum and only used sparingly on the sides. The back is fairly cheap-feeling plastic, which picks up oily residue easily and becomes slippery quickly, but it hasn’t gained any scratches during my time with it.. Instead of using the flattened home button that Sony switched to with the Xperia Z5 range, the Xperia XA goes back a metallic circular switch. It’s tiny and responsive, but lacks a fingerprint scanner. Some might say it’s harsh to knock a £240 phone for this lapse, but Moto managed to squeeze one into the £199 Moto G4 , and the vast majority of budget Honor phones have them, too.. Below the standby switch is a mushy volume rocker that doesn’t give much feedback when pressed, and under that is a physical two-stage camera shutter button. The shutter button is a great addition that gives you quick access to the camera and makes the XA feel more natural to use when taking photos.. I am a little bit disappointed by the XA’s lack of water resistance. Sony championed water resistance on phones such as the Xperia M5 and Xperia M4 Aqua , and it’s one feature other budget options lack, so it would’ve given the Xperia XA something to set it apart..

Being fair to Sony, the display is one of the better 720p panels I’ve used, but it’s far from great.. My biggest gripe is colour – there just isn’t that ‘oomph’ you normally get from a Sony panel. Even with the bright purples, pinks, reds and oranges in the preloaded wallpapers feel washed out and dull.. There’s a distinct lack of brightness, too. Normally I’d keep a phone at around 60% brightness – I’m not a fan of auto-brightness – but with the Xperia XA I’m having to constantly keep it at about 80-90% to make it readable in the majority of lighting conditions.. Viewing angles are good, which is something that often trips up cheaper phones, as is outdoor visibility, but for the price I expected more. Motorola managed to fit an FHD panel into a £169 phone, as did Huawei on the Honor 5X .. 720p spread over a 5-inch display is still fine, but my eye can spot individual pixels and it makes videos and especially pictures look blurry. The display pales in comparison to those on the Moto G4 and iPhone SE.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

Sony Xperia XA review: overcharging on entrance. The Sony Xperia XA is the low-cost entry in Sony's new lineup. Apart from the cameras and the battery life, it offers a mediocre serving. Find out why it might still be of interest in our full review of the Sony Xperia XA.. ✕ Poor battery life for a Sony device. Sony Xperia XA release date and price. The Sony Xperia XA is currently available for pre-order with a shipping date of July 17. The price is set at $279.99, although Amazon is currently offering it at a reduced price of $267.97. It's available in white, graphite black, lime gold and rose gold. Alternatives for this price are the 5.5-inch Moto G4 Plus , which houses more power, or the Honor 7 , which has better battery life.. Sony Xperia XA design and build quality. The virtually borderless display transitions smoothly into the plastic frame. The Nano-SIM and MicroSD cards can be swapped in and out without extra tools. Note the rounded transition between the frame and the glass display. The plastic case makes, at the very least, a good first impression. A fingerprint scanner is not something you will find on a Sony device under $300. The top and bottom portions of the frame are also plastic. The Sony Xperia XA looks and feels very good, despite lacking the metal unibody of the Xperia X – it instead has a plastic enclosure. Unfortunately, Sony has omitted the splash protection that the Xperia XA’s predecessors, the Xperia M4 Aqua and Xperia M5, featured.. The Sony Xperia XA is beguiling to the touch. It feels pleasantly matt and smooth and has an edgeless and gapless design. The volume rocker sits slightly higher than on many other Xperia models, making it easier to reach.. A discrete flap on the side of the phone can be removed with your fingernail, granting you access to the Nano-SIM or microSD card slot without the need for a special tool. However, the flap is not sealed against liquids and dust.. The Sony Xperia XA weighs 137 grams and is 7.9-millimeters thick. The most visible design differences to the Xperia X and X Performance models is the XA’s lack of fingerprint scanner and, as mentioned previously, its choice of casing material.. It’s impossible to say how well the plastic casing copes in the long term, as we only tested the device for a week.. Sony does offer a selection of protective cases for the Xperia XA. Firstly, there is the flip cover , which comes in the four possible body colors. When you flip the cover open, the display is automatically activated; close it and the display switches off.. Next up is the StyleCover SBC26 , which is also available in the four housing colors. It is placed over the rear panel and device edges, protruding slightly above the edge of the display. Then there is the Smart Style Cover SBC24 , which is thin, transparent and practically invisible.. The metal edges on the left and right side of the Xperia XA are cool to the touch.. Compared to the Xperia X (top) the display of the Xperia XA is weak. The display of Xperia XA is faint and humble. Even at maximum brightness, it is not easy to read on bright days. And small fonts show a visible seam about the edges of the characters.. The display of the Sony Xperia XA is 5 inches and features HD resolution (1,280 x 720) making for 293 pixels per inch. Other reviews confirm that the display has a brightness of 502 cd / m² and a contrast ratio of 1564:1.. Sony uses its in-house Triluminous technology on an IPS display. In the display settings you will find two color profile presets from Sony: the Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2 and the Super Vivid mode increase the saturation of images and videos that you look at in Sony's Gallery app. Outside of the app, the profiles have no discernable effect.. The Xperia XA leaves the factory running Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Stamina mode is rendered largely unneccesary after the implementation of Marshmallow's Doze feature. The software of the Sony Xperia XA comes with a lot of preinstalled apps. Since you’re unlikely to use many of them, none of them can be uninstalled, and they occupy a lot of space on the scarce internal memory, they are a very annoying inconvenience.. Sony gives the XA Android 6.0 Marshmallow. We tested the device in July, but it was still only covered by the April security patch. Thus, Sony is less reliable than Google, Samsung or HTC when it comes to security. Those three manufacturers provide software updates earlier and address known vulnerabilities in a more timely manner.. Besides Sony’s own apps, there are also a range of third-party apps that come preinstalled. Our review device came with Amazon, AVG Protection, Facebook, Kobo eBooks, Sky Go, Spotify and SwiftKey. Thus, the internal memory left at your disposal is less than 5 of the original 16 GB.. What use are eight cores if none of them are fast? / © ANDROIDPIT. You can expand the Xperia XA's memory using a hack. Aside from the camera, everything is a little slow paced on the Xperia XA. Games have mediocre graphics, apps start with noticeable load times and multitasking is no fun. If you only change between the camera app, Facebook and WhatsApp, the XA performs decently enough; everything else is a chore.. Inside the Xperia XA, there’s the MediaTek Helio P10 processor, which has eight cores clocked at 2 GHz. However, the ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores belong squarely to the mid-range. The chip’s GPU is the Mali-T860, which only has two 700 MHz cores, providing weak performance. The mobile internet, at least, is fast enough: the LTE is Cat. 6, offering speeds up to 150 Mbit/s.. If you need more power, perhaps to play games, we recommend the Honor 5X over the Xperia XA. This is considerably better equipped and even costs a little less.. Since Sony has laden the device with bloatware, the purchase of a MicroSD card is all but essential. If you want to use it to expand the internal memory, you will need a little know-how, however. The Xperia XA runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which allows users to format MircoSD cards as internal memory, but Sony has decided to disable this option, so you will need a command line to get it back, making the process just a little more laborious.. FM radio and an equalizer are two of the audio tools at the XA's disposal. The internal speaker on the Xperia XA is weak and tinny. The voice quality when making calls is clear, however. The headset sounds warm and is well-shielded against background noise. The audio options allow for improvements to be made to the sound quality. Sony offers a five-band equalizer with bass boost for further adjustments.. The rear camera offers outstanding focusing speeds. A rarity for Android smartphones: even backlit selfies come out well. Sony's camera app offers a limited manual mode. The Xperia XA’s cameras are the phone’s main selling point. The main camera delivers detailed, high-contrast pictures with bright colors. Only when looking closely can small artifacts be seen around the edges of objects. Even in low light it provides decent results. The Selfie camera is also above average.. Sony has paid special attention to the camera equipment on the Xperia XA. The rear camera is 13 MP with an f / 2.0 aperture and a simple LED flash. The front-facing camera is 8 MP and also has an f / 2.0 aperture, plus an 88-degree wide-angle lens. The selfie camera has no flash, but it does have an HDR mode, which yields good results in backlit conditions.. The hybrid autofocus on the Xperia XA with its phase and contrast measurement ensures practically instantaneous, blur-free shots. This, together with the dedicated camera button, makes the Xperia XA a solid replacement for a digital camera.. The camera app features a manual mode, although it is not nearly as extensive as some, for example, on the HTC One A9 or Huawei P9. It is therefore advisable to shoot all your photos using the Superior Auto setting. The focusing is fast and provides mostly sharp results.. The battery life of the Xperia XA is mediocre in comparison to its competitors. Particularly when using the camera app, the battery drains quite quickly. This is a shame: after all, the camera is supposed to be the Xperia XA’s main selling point. The PC Mark Battery Benchmark returns an operating time of 6:46 hours. When idle, the XA can last up to two days, but in everyday life you will need to charge it daily.. The 2,300-mAh battery cannot be replaced, but you can fully charge it with the supplied charger within half an hour.. 143.6 x 66.8 x 7.9 mm. 1280 x 720 pixels (294 ppi). the Xperia XA down to two key. features of the lower upper class: camera and design. However, looking to the left and right in this price range reveals some better alternatives. These might not take better pictures or look so chic, but they either last longer, work considerably faster or have better software.. fan of Sony, there are even better products from the brand in the same price range. The significantly faster and also waterproof Xperia Z3 Compact is available now for as little as $240 .. Why Sony don't understand that smartphone top 1inch and bottom 1inch bezels look utterly useless and bad. And reduce screen to body ratio and increase phone size uselessly. Due to this reason I don't like sony phones.. The z3 compact is a far better phone than the xa and cheaper.. I used to love Sony Xperia.. Again a big fan of its design and features... m using it for last few days....everything is good at this price except processor and battery capacity.. Curves gives it cutting edge look & specs are also good in this price. MWC 2018 live updates: Sony's Xperia gets a makeover. * Please enter a valid email address. Almost done!

Modern design, great build Battery will still hold good charge well into lifecycle Practical performance. Devices are not waterproof Sony Xperia XA takes just average photographs for a mid-range phone Odd button arrangement. Both the Sony Xperia X and XA are good enough to recommend. They are practical, mid-range smartphones with swift performance and excellent build quality.. Battery will still hold good charge well into lifecycle. Sony Xperia XA takes just average photographs for a mid-range phone. Sony flagship smartphones are reliable, consistent, and often conservative with new features and technologies. With the Sony Xperia X and Sony Xperia XA, that’s true with its midrange offerings as well.. Inexpensive smartphones from Chinese manufacturers like ZTE, Huawei , and Xiaomi are flooding this market segment, and Sony hopes a fresh combination of features can help these two 5-inch Xperias compete. In other words, Sony wants to attract customers in the mid-range market by offering the same excellent experience from its flagships at a lower price.. The Sony Xperia XA features an HD display, MediaTek’s octa-core Helio P10 processor, and a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera; while the slightly more powerful Xperia X has a Full HD display, Qualcomm’s hexa-core Snapdragon 650, and a 23-megapixel back camera. The devices are identical on a software level, and run nearly pure Android OS 6.0.1 (Marshmallow) with only slight cosmetic tweaks.. Even with a square design, Sony smartphones are recognizable for their modern appearance. And the two new Xperias have an up-to-date aesthetic, aided by their exceptionally robust finish, build material, and 2.5D glass display.. The Xperia XA features an edge-to-edge display, with almost no display bezel, while its side curvatures naturally flow to the rounded metal ring around the edges. The back is polycarbonate, which is a highly solid and resilient plastic. The more powerful Sony Xperia X has a thicker bezel, with polycarbonate sides and a metal rear panel.. The Xperias are two of the most attractive mid-range smartphones we’ve seen, and have almost identical dimensions: 142 x 69 x 7.9 mm (5.62 x 2.73 x 0.31 inches) for the Xperia X, and 143 x 67 x 7.9 mm (5.65 x 2.63 x 0.31 inches) for the Xperia XA. The metal clad Xperia X is somewhat heavier, weighing 153 grams (5.40 ounces), while the Xperia XA weighs 137 grams (4.83 ounces). Both feel comfortable and solid in hand. Neither easily slips out and it’s evident Sony put a lot into the industrial designs.. While IP69 certification is common with the Z series, Sony failed to include with the new X and XA, meaning neither is waterproof. At least, Sony is not claiming either is waterproof, but reps did comment that both can still get a little wet and function just fine. It’s a flagship feature that doesn’t lessen the practical nature of the phone on the everyday level, and the user experience remains the same.. The button arrangement on the right side could present problems, given that the volume rocker is situated under the power key, putting it out of thumb’s reach. There’s a physical camera button on the right bottom, which has limited purpose to a certain degree as the devices are not waterproof (touchscreens don’t function very well while wet, making smartphone photography near impossible). The Xperia X also has a built-in fingerprint reader in the power key.. The left side includes the nanoSIM and microSD card slots (the microSD slop doubles as another SIM tray in the dual-SIM version). The upper side includes a 3.5-mm audio jack and a secondary microphone, while the lower side on both devices holds the speaker, primary microphone, and microUSB 2.0 input. The rear includes the NFC and Sony logos, along with the camera lens. Its signature ring slightly sticks out from the back cover. Neither device has a removable battery.. Both Android smartphones feature 5-inch IPS LCD displays. The more powerful Xperia X has a Full HD resolution (1080 x 1920), while the less powerful Xperia XA has ‘just’ an HD resolution (720 x 1280). The Xperia X sports 441 pixels per inch, while the Xperia XA has a 294 ppi count. In addition both use slightly different screen technologies that affect the overall display quality.. The Sony Xperia X has a Bravia Triluminos and X-Reality screen, meaning it also has so-called Quantum Dot technology. This results in above-average color saturation that impresses visually, even if it doesn’t look entirely realistic. Overall color calibration is decent besides, making it easier to also overlook the white balance shift toward blue tones. All of this results in a very sustainable contrast, and the Xperia X does very well in direct sunlight, and has wide viewing angles.. Those flaws are more pronounced on the Sony Xperia XA. Pixel density is high enough for sharp imaging; however, the white balance shift towards the blue part of the specter as well. That, coupled with the less intense saturation, results in unrealistic color calibration. Thankfully, Sony enabled manual settings for red, green, and blue. So it’s possible to tweak the XA display into something more impressive. Unfortunately, contrast sustainability is just average.. The Xperia X and Xperia XA each have a different hardware platform, but offer an almost the identical fluid performance.. The Sony Xperia X has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 chipset, which comes with two Cortex-A72 cores running a 1.8GHz clock and four Cortex-A53 cores running a 1.4GHz clock, with Adreno 510 GUP, as well as 3GB of RAM. It has 32 or 64GB of memory storage and can be expanded with additional 256GB with microSD cards. With a Geekbench 3 multi-core score of 3790, this configuration performs only slightly poorer on synthetic benchmarks than Sony’s latest flagship model, the Xperia Z5. More recent high-end handsets score around 5400. Otherwise, all tasks run fast and without any lag in use, including demanding games.. The Sony Xperia XA has a MediaTek MT6755 Helio P10 chipset with eight Cortex-A53 cores running a 2GHz clock and Mali-T860MP2 graphic chip, and 2GB of RAM. There is 16GB of memory storage, with microSD support up to 256GB. Geekbench 3 crashed each time we ran it during testing. In practice, there’s little to no difference between it and the X.. Both devices ship with Qnovo batteries, which support the Quick Charge 2.0 standard, and degrade more slowly over time compared against other batteries. This means the battery will hold a better charge after a few years of service than other device batteries.. Overall battery autonomy is average for both, but is slightly better on the Xperia X. Its battery capacity is 2600mAh, while the Xperia XA has a 2300mAh battery. The Xperia X lasted 7 hours and 10 minutes streaming video with the display brightness set to max, while the Xperia XA lasted 6 hours and 59 minutes. Both devices will last a full day with intense use. Using Sony’s Stamina power saving mode, or Stamina Ultra, will stretch that out to about two days with the Xperia X.. The camera performance of the two Xperias is enough to be a deciding factor in purchasing. The Sony Xperia X has a 23-megapixel rear camera, with a 1/2.3-inch sensor and f/2.0. It has an impressive 13-megapixel selfie camera, also with f/2.0 and a 1.3-inch sensor. Just looking at the specs, this front-facing camera matches the rear camera on the iPhone 6S. The Sony XA has a similar camera in the back, with an 8-megapixel camera in the front, and a ¼-inch sensor.. The more powerful Android smartphone also boasts Predictive Hybrid Autofocus, and can hold a selected object in focus while moving.. While its biggest advantage are the high-resolution 23-megapixel images, the Sony Xperia X still takes the same level of images as other mid-range phones. The X performance can’t match the output from the Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphones , or other flagships.. The big issue affecting image is low-light noise, and the excessive retouching that occurs with the noise reduction feature. Additionally, the images suffer from under-saturated colors when viewed off the smartphone; given that the phone’s display saturates the colors with more intensity while displaying them. Thankfully, this can be fixed by manually setting the dynamic range. The selfie camera offers similar results, just with less resolution. For a front camera, that’s not bad.. The Sony Xperia XA takes similar images, but the issues are harder to fix with editing due to the smaller resolution.. Both the Sony Xperia X and XA are good enough to recommend. They are practical, mid-range smartphones with swift performance and excellent build quality. The X is definitely the superior of the two, given its display and camera performance. But in day-to-day use, the XA performs just as well. Given Sony’s reputation, we’re confident in saying they’ll serve users well for a number of years, making their relatively high price easier to accept.

Sony Xperia XA review: The cheapest member of Sony’s new 2016 X-series phones makes some serious compromises to cut costs, but also boasts some gorgeous design. Is it a case of beauty over brains? Here’s our full in-depth Xperia XA review.. Sony first showed off its new Xperia X-series smartphones way back in February, during the general bedlam of MWC 2016. However, while we’ve already reviewed the flag-waving Xperia X , we only just got our hands on the cheapest handset in the family, the Xperia XA.. The Xperia XA is roughly £200 cheaper than the Xperia X, with an asking price similar to the Moto G4 Plus and not far off the OnePlus 3. So how does it stack up? Here’s our full Sony Xperia XA review.. Read next: Sony Xperia XA vs Xperia X vs Xperia XA Ultra vs Xperia X Performance. One of the greatest aspects of the Xperia XA is the gorgeous design. Hands-down, this has to be the best-looking Sony phone in quite some time; actually, it’s one of the best-looking mid-range mobiles from any manufacturer, ever.. Part of its appeal is down to the edge-to-edge screen, with only the tiniest of bezels separating the display from the shiny silver surround. That subtle curvature at the edges of the phone adds a further premium finish. It’s just a shame that Sony has ditched the metal back of the Xperia X, replacing it with a slice of plastic that’s susceptible to scratches.. The stretched design of the Xperia XA means that one-handed use isn’t entirely easy, especially when you try and reach your thumb to the top of the screen. Still, Sony’s phone is a lot easier to handle than the bulky Moto G4 and Moto G4 Plus, as well as the OnePlus 3. And if your heart’s well and truly set on a compact handset, we highly recommend the Xperia Z5 Compact instead.. Like the Xperia X, the XA isn’t water resistant, so ditch those dreams of shower selfies. You can’t prise the back plate off to access the battery either; the SIM card and microSD memory card slide into a pop-open drawer on the phone’s left edge.. Over on the Xperia XA’s right edge, you’ll spot that the super-skinny fingerprint sensor from the Xperia X and Xperia Z5 has been replaced with Sony’s old-yet-iconic circular power button. Obviously this means you’ll have to stick with PIN entry or Android’s smart unlock feature to access your data instead.. That edge-to-edge 5-inch screen packs a 720p resolution, which means less pixels smushed into every square inch compared with the Xperia X, as well as similarly-priced rivals such as the Moto G4.. However, the Xperia XA still pumps out sharp, eye-pleasing images. You’ll need superior eyesight to make out any individual pixels, while colour vibrancy and warmth can be manually adjusted inside the phone’s display settings. Using Sony’s Super Vivid Mode, you’ll enjoy quite punchy colours as long as you boost the screen brightness up. And on maximum brightness, clarity definitely isn’t an issue, even when you’re stood beneath harsh lighting.. If you want to carry around a big media collection, you’ll definitely want to slip a microSD memory card into the Xperia XA. The 16GB of storage is mostly used up by Android and Sony’s own services, leaving just under 6GB free in total. And as apps need to be stored on the phone, you’re limited in how many megabyte-munching games you can carry.. We’d also recommend investing in a decent pair of headphones. The Xperia XA’s built-in bottom-mounted speaker is about as powerful as a particularly lethargic caterpillar, and although sound quality is fine, you’ll struggle to hear anything over your typical street background noise.. Sadly there’s no support for Hi-Res audio either (and Sony’s DSEE HX feature, which upscales compressed music files, is missing in action).. Sony has understandably had to trim features from the Xperia X to make the Xperia XA’s lower price point work. So, as mentioned, gone is the fingerprint scanner and support for Hi-Res music tracks. You also get a stripped-down camera experience compared with the X (more on this later), while the Remote Play feature for streaming PS4 games is also dead in the water.. In other words, most of what made the Xperia X so great has been eliminated, leaving you with a rather shallow set of features.. Still, at least Android 6.0 Marshmallow is still packed inside the Xperia XA, complete with Sony’s colourful overlay. We love how the phone’s software now matches the hardware, with the same colourful splashes streaking across the Xperia XA’s desktops (and even stretching as far as the packaging, which is a neat touch).. It’s just a shame that rival phones like the Moto G4 Plus still manage to offer a fingerprint sensor and other bonus features, for the same price or cheaper.. Sadly it’s more bad news for the Xperia XA when it comes to performance and battery life.. The Xperia XA has a basic Mediatek Helio P10 processor stuffed in its bowels, backed up by 2GB of RAM. If you’re a bit geeky, then this bit’s for you: the Xperia XA scored just 47k in our AnTuTu benchmarking, which is well behind the OnePlus 3’s mega-impressive 139k result. And while that’s marginally better than the Moto G4’s 45k score, we saw less stammering on the Moto during everyday use.. In normal people speak, the Xperia XA is rather stunted in the performance department. Android runs reasonably well most of the time, but occasionally there’s a jarring stutter or an app takes several seconds to load up, something we rarely see on rivals like the Moto G4. And while games such as Real Racing are very much playable, we’re expecting the Xperia XA to heavily show its budget roots after just a few months of use.. Battery life also lags behind rivals, which is disappointing considering how good each Xperia phone usually performs in this department. With regulated use, I just about made it from breakfast to bed on a single charge. If I was less restrained and spent a couple of hours messing around online during my commutes, then I would have to charge the Xperia XA as soon as I got home from work.. In our media tests, the Xperia XA also struggled, surviving for just under six hours. That’s nowhere near the nine to ten hours we got from the Moto G4 and OnePlus 3.. Thankfully you can usually depend on Sony’s camera tech to perform. And while the Xperia XA’s 13-megapixel and 8-megapixel cameras face stiff competition from the excellent Moto G4 and G4 Plus snappers, they still hold their own thanks to Sony’s dependable Superior Auto mode and its smart focus-tracking tech.. Check out our in-depth Xperia XA camera review for photo and video samples and our full analysis.. The Xperia XA is a cheap but not-so-cheerful cousin to the Xperia X, and while the gorgeous design promises a slick and affordable smartphone, the Xperia XA sadly loses out to similarly-priced rivals. It can certainly beat them for looks, but when it comes to smarts, as well as longevity, we would rather get our hands on the Moto G4 Plus instead..

Others, like this Xperia XA, go for less well-known CPUs.. Instead of using silicon made by Qualcomm, a mainstay in a vast majority of Android phones, Sony uses a Mediatek CPU. To be more precise it’s the Helios P10 chipset that budget-focused brands like Elephone have been using. It’s octa-core, LTE-equipped and has a clock speed of 2.0GHz. Alongside it sits 2GB of RAM – respectable enough for a phone of this price – and a Mali T860 GPU.. The specs aren’t anything to write home about, but the phone’s general performance isn’t terrible. With day-to-day use the XA’s performance is perfectly fine. Basic apps (Hangouts, Chrome, Gmail, Twitter, Snapchat) all work without a hitch, though more intensive ones (VSCO, Afterlight, etc) can feel sluggish.. It’s a similar situation with games. You should be OK unless you want to max out Asphalt 8 and not see any dropped frames. Loading times were also much longer on the Xperia XA compared to the Moto G4, but you’ll probably only notice this if you have both phones next to each other.. Related: Best budget phones In TrustedReviews ‘ usual suite of benchmarking tests, the Sony Xperia XA scored 47,959 in the AnTuTu test. This is a respectable mid-range score, putting it the same bracket as the Fairphone 2 and slightly above the Nexus 5X. I’d normally use Geekbench 3 too, but that failed every time, citing lack of an internet connection.. 16GB is the only storage option available, and with a couple of apps installed I was quickly down to about 6GB of space. Thankfully, there’s a microSD card slot, and I’d certainly advise picking up a card ( this SanDisk Ultra 64GB one is great, and very affordable ) if you want to save music and videos offline.. The downward-facing speaker is rubbish, a disappointment from a brand so music-focused as Sony, and the microphones are a little on the quiet side. Expect to speak up a bit when you’re on the phone in blustery conditions.. WATCH: What’s the best flagship phone right now?. While I have multiple dislikes about this phone, the software certainly isn’t one of them. Just like on the Xperia X , Sony has shown restraint with the Android OS and killed many of the superfluous features of its previous skins.. It’s clean and good-looking, with full-width notifications that really show off that edge-to-edge display. I also really like Sony’s new lock screen, which can be colour customised with different pastel-shaded themes.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Sony does include a lot of its own apps, notably Music, Album, Video and some more annoying ones like AR effect, AVG Protection and What’s New. It’s nice to see the majority of these can be deleted, so it seems harsh to criticise this.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

Sony's new mid-ranger takes the design DNA and performance of the Xperia X and transforms it into a more affordable package.. So we've already seen the Xperia X and Xperia X Performance , Sony's two new hero phones that broke cover today at Mobile World Congress. The regular Xperia X looks like a great mainstream phone, while the "Performance" version brings the power of a Snapdragon 820 into the mix. But what about the traditional mid-range space? Well, Sony isn't ignoring the need for more affordable phones, as evidenced by the budget-conscious Xperia XA, also unveiled today in Barcelona.. The Xperia XA is pretty easy to identify as a Sony phone, with its symmetrical design and metallic trim. From a distance, it's easily confused with its more expensive sibling, the Xperia X. To spot the differences between the two, you'll need to examine it more closely.. Sony's new mid-ranger takes the Xperia X's looks and recreates them in a traditional polycarbonate shell. The phone's front sports the same slick glass front as the X, with a gentle slope towards the edges, while downscaling to a 720p resolution at 5 inches. That's a relatively low number even in the mid-range space, but what the Xperia XA lacks in resolution it makes up for with impressive brightness and colors that really pop.. It might feel like plastic, but in any of its four colors this is a good-looking phone.. The outer frame of the phone is a familiar sight, with Sony's traditional circular power button on the right edge — no fingerprint scanner this time — along with volume and camera shutter keys. The back panel, which flows gently into the trim — and while it looks vaguely metallic, it feels very much like a polycarbonate shell.. Like its big brothers, the Xperia XA's 5-inch size makes it easy on hands and pockets, and the razor-slim horizontal bezels also make for some striking visuals. It might feel like plastic, but in any of its four colors — white, graphite, lime and rose gold — this is a good-looking phone.. On the inside, the XA is powered by a MediaTek Helio P10 processor, an octa-core chip using ARM's low-power Cortex-A53 cores. It's also packing 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, along with microSD expandability. So it's firmly a mid-range handset, but performance leaves nothing wanting, with apps loading quickly and smoothly in our brief time with the phone. Once again, two-day battery life is promised from the phone, which packs a 2,300mAh internal cell.. As for imaging, the Xperia XA includes a 13-megapixel rear shooter along with the redesigned camera app from the Xperia X, giving you a wide array of shooting modes and manual options for ISO, exposure levels and other variables. It's not as fast to focus as the X, but once it's there, it's capable of firing off images in rapid succession. Around the front, there's a more standard 8-megapixel sensor reporting for selfie duty.. In an age when many mid-ranger still don't arrive with the latest version of Android, it's reassuring to see Sony shipping the Xperia XA with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow , in addition to the latest Sony UI. As we've discussed before , Sony has a pretty light touch when it comes to customizing Android, with major additions to Marshmallow including its own apps, a stylized lock screen with a large clock widget, and re-tooled Material Design dialer and messaging apps.. It's not always easy to get excited about a mid-range phone, these being more about which compromises a manufacturer has put in place than a singe stand-out feature. But the choices Sony has made in the Xperia XA all make sense, and as a result it's looking like a promising phone indeed.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

Andreas Kilian ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 08/14/2016. Android ARM Smartphone Touchscreen. Golden times? With its Xperia XA, Sony sends a new designer piece into the smartphone mid-range ring. Esthetes in particular should notice the slim lateral display bezel and the plain build right away. But are the inner values enough to keep the rivals at a distance?.

Sony's mid-range Xperia XA model is one of the manufacturer's new X-line, and a starting price of 300 Euros (~$335; market prices start at approx. 270 Euros/~$302) places it between the. Xperia X , which is based on stronger components and the much cheaper. In addition to the color "Lime Gold" that adorns our review sample, the smartphone is also available in "Rose Gold", "Graphite Black", and "White". They all come with an octa-core. SoC by MediaTek , 2 GB of RAM, and 16 GB of internal storage. The device is powered by Android 6.0 Marshmallow ex-factory.. ZTE's Blade V7 , and Samsung's. models are the hottest rivals of the Xperia XA. Non-Android based opponents are rare in this price range, and thus Microsoft's Lumia 650 ,. already available with a price tag starting at 170 Euros (~$190) has to prove its capabilities..

As mentioned in the introduction, the casing of the Xperia XA primarily catches the attention with its particularly slim design. It has a width of just 66.8 millimeters (~2.6 in) to which the very narrow display bezel of less than one millimeter contributes. Microsoft's Lumia 650 , also equipped with a 5-inch screen, is 4.1 millimeters (~0.2 in) wider. The touchscreen's seamless transition into the lateral frame also looks well-implemented. However, the review sample does not stand out from its rivals favorably in terms of the other dimensions, and some users might consider it rather too long due to its unusual proportions. Sony primarily relies on plastic for the casing's material; metal is only used on the bezel's long lateral edges. This combination makes a relatively low weight of 137 grams (~5 oz) possible.. With its evenly spaced gaps and rounded surfaces on the front and rear, the smartphone is pleasant to hold and leaves a high-quality impression. At most, the slightly rough transition between the glass and metal on the touchscreen's sides in some places could be criticized. It is also too bad that the first hairline scratches on both the screen and smartphone's back were visible at the end of the test - using a somewhat more robust material would certainly not have hurt the looks in the long run.. The construction proved quite stable and our twisting attempts did not cause any major deformations or disconcerting noises. Nevertheless, it is too bad that light pressure on the display bezel causes wave formations on the screen quite easily. The maintenance options are limited to replacing the SIM and micro-SD card; the battery is non-removable.. Sony Xperia XA front Sony Xperia XA front full resolution.

The smartphone has a 16 GB flash storage for photos, apps, and such. However, with roughly 8.4 GB available capacity, only about half of it can be used in the state of delivery - the rivals often have a bit more to offer despite a nominally identical storage capacity. It is also possible to expand the Xperia XA by up to 200 GB. This is not a full-fledged replacement as the memory card cannot be implemented in the internal storage. At least files, such as photos and videos, and App2SD-supporting programs can be moved to it. A traditional 3.5-mm headset jack is installed for audio output. Data sharing is possible via a conventional micro-USB port with OTG functionality.. In addition, the smartphone supports video transmission via Miracast and media streaming via DLNA. NFC and a notification LED are also on board. The Xperia XA buyer will not find a fingerprint scanner, such as found in. Upper edge: Microphone, 3.5-mm headset jack. Lower edge: Micro-USB port, microphone, speaker. Right: Camera release, volume control, power button. Sony ships the new model with Android 6.0 ex-factory. However, it is too bad that the manufacturer is rather slow with updates - the security patch from April 1st 2016 was still installed after looking for updates.. Sony has modified the Android user interface carefully and added some convenient features. These are mainly visual modifications to the graphic elements such as icons and backgrounds. The user still has to scroll vertically through the app drawer.. As well as typical Sony apps (Xperia Lounge, Playstation, What's New, Movie Creator, Sketch, TrackID), Sony has unfortunately preloaded several third-party programs such as Amazon Shopping, Facebook, Kobo eBooks, AVG Protection, Sky Go, and Spotify. Although they can all be deactivated, they cannot be uninstalled.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

As well as the standard GSM and UMTS frequencies, the Xperia XA's mobile network modem also supports LTE Cat. 4 with up to 150 Mbit/s in download and 50 Mbit/s in upload. The handset can connect to both 2.4 and 5 GHz networks via Wi-Fi. In the speed test with our Linksys EA8500 reference router, the smartphone clearly outperforms cheaper handsets without 5 GHz Wi-Fi, such as. Honor's 5C , with gross data rates of 92.5 Mbit/s and 83.6 Mbit/s. It is, however, far from its more expensive. sister model or premium smartphones from Huawei.

The GPS module in the Xperia XA quickly finds the user's current position outdoors and in many cases connecting to satellite networks also functioned smoothly in the indoors. According to the app, the Xperia XA has an accuracy of up to a meter (3 ft) - an outstanding outcome. Our test route where we let the smartphone compete against Garmin's Edge 500 bike computer reveals whether this has a positive impact in practical situations. The Xperia XA is slightly disappointing after the initially very good rates with a total deviation of almost 3% in length and a rather rough logging of the driven route - particularly in the area of the turning point. Nevertheless, the actual performance should be more than sufficient for normal navigation purposes.. Garmin Edge 500 - turning point. Sony Xperia XA - turning point.

Sony still relies on the familiar app from its Z-line for phone functionality. Many features are found on the main page, such as a search box for contacts, call list, and an overview of frequently called numbers. A keypad and address book can be accessed directly via faded-in icons.. The sufficient volume and clear voices at both ends of the call were good, when making calls using the earpiece. However, a quiet and not really annoying noise was sometimes audible. Using the headset for making calls also functioned very well. The tide turns when using hands-free mode: Both the speaker that is only sufficiently loud in quiet environments and the tinny-sounding microphone with too quiet voice recording prevented a relaxed conversation with the contact.. Primary camera photo (click for original). Primary camera panorama photo (click for original). The primary camera in Sony's Xperia XA has a category-standard resolution of 13 megapixels. It has also been equipped to a hybrid autofocus that makes it possible to take snapshots very quickly. An 8-megapixel webcam is installed on the front, which - uncharacteristically - also has autofocus. Both cameras have an aperture of f/2.0 and record videos with a maximum of Full HD at 30 frames per second.. While we liked the primary camera's fast autofocus and physical release button, the photo quality does not stand out significantly from other mid-range opponents: Firstly, some photos look unusually pale (scene 1), and secondly, grass and leaves often merge into green pulp (scene 2). Unfortunately, the review sample does not really shine in low-light conditions, although Sony boasts with "stunning low-light shots" (scene 3). The combination of strong noise cancellation and the absence of an optical image stabilizer is probably the reason for this. OnePlus' 3 , produce sharper photos across the board. However, the achieved quality is still acceptable for a mid-range handset. We also noticed that slightly more than 10 centimeters (~4 in) of. distance to the object is needed for macro photos than with many other smartphones.. The selfie camera on the front made a good impression. Thanks to its autofocus, it produces a nice depth of field in selfies, but it can also shoot comparatively sharp landscape photos when desired (see comparison photo).. Videos recorded with both cameras look smooth thanks to 30 frames per second. However, the brightness differences in panning shots are quite harsh and the simultaneous audio recording sounds rather muffled. Furthermore, the primary camera's autofocus is unreliable as it refocuses after movements - often unnecessarily. On the other hand, the optional electronic image stabilizer "SteadyShot" that can be activated, functions efficiently, but its use involves a slightly tighter camera viewing angle.. In addition to automatic, the camera app offers a manual mode where the user can set the ISO rate and white balance. Furthermore, scene modes, such as night shots or animals, can be found here. Panoramas can be created via the "Camera Apps" mode that provides additional functions. The quality of the panorama shots is not satisfactory due to numerous image errors (see sample photo).. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. We test whether the primary camera in the Xperia XA reproduces colors accurately by taking a photo of X-Rite's ColorChecker Passport in controlled light conditions and compare it with the actual reference colors. The photo is not edited afterward, for example, via manual white balance.. It is clearly visible that the reproduction of most colors is too saturated, which is particularly true for red tones. Furthermore, a slight underexposure becomes obvious in the photo when looking at the grayscale levels' brightness.. Blurred details that are sometimes seen in our sample photos are not observed when photographing our test chart in defined artificial light. The camera does a very good job here and hardly presents weaknesses for a mid-range handset. Only a slight decrease in sharpness is evident toward the corners. Samsung's Galaxy J5 (2016) , do a worse job here.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. In addition to the smartphone, the buyer will find an in-ear headset that, unlike many headphones nowadays, is not inserted directly into the ear canal, but rather sits on the ear cup in the box of the Xperia XA. Furthermore, a 7.5-watt power supply (1.5 A/5V) alongside a micro-USB cable and quick start guide are included. that supports MediaTek's Pump Express+ 2.0 as matching original accessories. Unfortunately, the latter was not available at the time of testing.. Sony includes a 2-year warranty on the smartphone and a 1-year warranty on included accessories in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.. Sony has preloaded the keyboard solution "SwiftKey" on the Xperia XA. Both its looks and functionality can be adapted extensively to meet the user's needs. It is also possible to enter text via swipe.. The physical keys on the casing's right can be discerned well, thanks to their different shapes. It is also good that the camera has a dedicated button, which also launches the photo app in standby when pressed slightly longer. The build is solid, but the pressure point of the relatively sticky volume control was rather spongy in our review sample.. Unfortunately, the touchscreen in the review sample had recurrent problems. Sometimes it did not detect inputs correctly for no obvious reason, making it impossible, for example, to open quick settings or notifications via swipe. This phenomenon was also observed when browsing, in the form of a shaky implementation of zoom gestures. However, the touchscreen always recovered after a short break and functioned impeccably and accurately for a while. On the other hand, the integrated position sensor always rotated the content according to the smartphone's position quite reliably.. Although slight hiccups were perceived when scrolling slowly through menus or websites, this does not apply to the subjective total performance. Other animations are rendered smoothly in routine use, and the smartphone did not present any unusually prolonged waiting times. It is, however, too bad that the screen in the Xperia XA cannot be activated from standby via double tapping. The power button on the side has to be used for this.. The Xperia XA is equipped with a 5-inch LC display with. This equates to a pixel density of 294 PPI. Although some rivalling models, such as. or ZTE's Blade V7 , boast with an even higher resolution in this price range, pixel structures are not visible in the Xperia XA at a normal viewing distance.. Sony's smartphone places itself at the top with an average brightness of 475 cd/mÂ² on a completely white screen â only Huawei's P9 Lite. can offer a similarly bright screen among the opponents. The maximum brightness does not change significantly when displaying equally distributed bright and dark areas on the screen (average picture level/APL 50). However, this increases to a maximum of 572 cd/mÂ² when the review sample's light sensor is enabled. The somewhat uneven illumination of 81% is not as good. With a contrast of 849:1, the Xperia XA places itself right between. ZTE's Blade V7 , also with an IPS panel. The relatively high contrast of 0.61 cd/mÂ² prevents achieving a better contrast, despite the high maximum brightness. On the positive side, there is hardly any visible clouding on the review sample's screen even in unfavorable conditions.. The smartphone behaved strangely as soon as the minimum screen brightness was selected manually. Despite this setting, the backlight's intensity fluctuated slightly depending on the displayed content.. 421 cd/m² 471 cd/m² 502 cd/m² 435 cd/m² 518 cd/m² 518 cd/m² 439 cd/m² 479 cd/m² 492 cd/m². 81 % Center on Battery: 518. cd/m²) ΔE Color 6.8 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 7 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.35.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM not detected. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display.

This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.3 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. The Xperia XA offers some options for customizing the color reproduction. The user can enable an image optimizer via either "Bravia Engine 2" or "Super-Vivid Mode", or the white balance can be adapted cross-system via a slider. The color temperature of 8151 K is clearly higher than the ideal rate of 6500 K when using Bravia Engine and default white balance, which becomes visible in a bluish tint in the grayscale levels. The color deviations of the Xperia XA are also much higher than the ideal range (less than 3) with DeltaE rates of 6.8 (colors) and 7 (grayscale). Almost all rivaling models present a better calibration; only. steps out of line with much larger aberrations here. Subjectively, the measured inaccuracies are not noticed in everyday use.. Grayscale (profile: Bravia, target color space sRGB). ColorChecker (profile: Bravia, target color space sRGB). Saturation Sweeps (profile: Bravia, target color space sRGB). Colorspace (profile: Bravia, target color space sRGB). Overall, the Xperia XA is quite suitable for outdoor use, thanks to its relatively high brightness. However, a shaded place is recommended in cases of direct sunlight or stronger reflections since only high-contrast image areas can then still be recognized.. Outdoors on a sunny day in the shade. In terms of viewing angle stability, the Xperia XA proves to be much weaker than its more expensive Xperia X sister model and rivals equipped with OLED panels. Although thanks to the IPS technology the image never inverts, the user has to live with clear changes in color tones and brightness decrease in flatter viewing angles.. Xperia X , a Qualcomm SoC is not installed in the Xperia XA but rather a processor from MediaTek. chip consists of 8 ARM Cortex A53 cores that clock at a maximum of 2 GHz. The working memory of 2 GB is average compared with the Android opponents: While. can shine with a generous 3 GB.. As a SoC from the upper mid-range, the Helio P10 gives a superb performance and makes the Xperia XA look very good compared with most rivals. delivers somewhat better scores in the AnTuTu, PCMark, and BaseMark benchmarks. Sonyâs choice of a lower resolution HD panel. pays off in the GFXBench and 3DMark graphic tests. Although the Huawei P9 Lite âs Full HD screen. is often slightly better in the offscreen tests, it loses its lead as soon as an image is really rendered. Consequently, the review sample takes the benchmark crown in this subfield.. AnTuTu v6 - Total Score (sort by value) Sony Xperia XA.

Although the 16 GB flash memory in the Xperia XA does not achieve a top ranking in Androbench 3 with its performance rates, a place in the midfield is always achieved when compared with the competition. The relatively fast sequential read speed of approximately 240 MB/s is particularly noticeable. However, there is still some elbowroom in random read processes: The. The outcome of the BaseMark OS II memory benchmark also fits in this picture: The Xperia XA takes the second place behind. It looks similarly solid with the memory card slot's interface. Using our Toshiba Exceria Pro M401 (THN-M401S0640E2, UHS-I Class 3, max. write: 80 MB/s) reference card, we determined the best write rate in the comparison field with 50.68 MB/s, and the read rate of 72.87 MB/s is also within reach of the leader,.

As the previous benchmark scores have clearly proven, the. graphics chip in the Xperia XA together with the screen's moderate resolution of 1280x720 pixels ensure a fast performance. Thus, in practice, even demanding games such as " Asphalt 8 " or " Dead Trigger 2 " can be played smoothly using high-quality settings.. While the integrated position sensors function inconspicuously well during games, the very noticeable temperature increase on the handset's rear could be quite annoying. The speaker situated on the side will not normally be covered by a hand - and if so, the sound is almost inaudible.. The smartphone itself is silent since it is cooled passively. However, we observed a relatively prominent coil whining from the included power supply that was still audible a few meters away in a quiet environment, particularly when the battery was fully charged.. The surface temperatures of the Xperia XA prove that a slim casing and a relatively strong processor are not always a good team. While the average idle temperatures of 33.4 Â°C (~92 Â°F) on the front and 31.7 Â°C (~89 Â°F) on the back are still within a normal range, the smartphone heats up to over 40 Â°C (~104 Â°F) during load. Although this is not really hot, it could cause moist hands, especially in the summer. The rivals usually remain a few degrees cooler. Huawei P9 Lite reaches a comparable top rate, that is, however, limited to spots.. It is, however, pleasing that the SoC does not throttle its clock speed due to the temperatures. The GFXBench battery test that performs the T-Rex test thirty times in succession and logs both the performance and battery consumption did not present any weaknesses here. 41.7 °C 41.6 °C 37.1 °C. 42 °C 41.6 °C 36.6 °C. 40.4 °C 40.2 °C 36.3 °C.

The Xperia XA's speaker is situated on the handset's lower edge, and thus the smartphone's sound is not impaired when placed on a table. However, the sound is almost completely inaudible when it is held in the hands and the small opening is covered accidentally. Furthermore, the maximum volume is quite low with at most 82.02 dB(A) in our Pink Noise test. This places the Xperia XA on one of the last places in our database compared with other smartphones. At the same time, the minimum volume is relatively high, resulting in a limited control range. The frequency response analysis clearly shows a clear deficiency in the medium-high tones and bass range. This results in a fairly thin sound subjectively that fortunately, does not become piercing and is mostly free of distortion.. The included headset is good, with a balanced sound. We did not observe any static via the 3.5-mm headset jack either.. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Deep Bass Middle Bass High Bass Lower Range Mids Higher Mids Lower Highs Mid Highs Upper Highs Super Highs 20 28 32.4 28 25 33.3 31.3 33.3 31 32.5 31.7 32.5 40 34.9 26 34.9 50 47.6 39.4 47.6 63 33.7 36.2 33.7 80 30.7 28.6 30.7 100 27.9 25.4 27.9 125 30.4 21.3 30.4 160 33.2 23.3 33.2 200 35.1 22.5 35.1 250 41.8 22.4 41.8 315 45.4 21.3 45.4 400 50 18.4 50 500 55.8 17.5 55.8 630 60.5 17.5 60.5 800 67 17.2 67 1000 67.4 16.8 67.4 1250 68.1 17.3 68.1 1600 64.8 17.4 64.8 2000 58.7 16.6 58.7 2500 64 17.3 64 3150 71.5 17.6 71.5 4000 74 17.6 74 5000 74.5 17.7 74.5 6300 73.9 17.4 73.9 8000 71 17.7 71 10000 69.4 17.9 69.4 12500 58.3 18.1 58.3 16000 48.9 18.1 48.9 SPL 82 29.8 82 N 48.5 1.3 48.5 median 60.5 Sony Xperia XA median 17.7 median 60.5 Delta 11.6 1.6 11.6 40.7 31.8 32.4 40.7 32.7 31.8 31.3 32.7 30.8 34.2 31.7 30.8 31.8 30.4 26 31.8 36.6 33.1 39.4 36.6 33.3 30.9 36.2 33.3 32.4 25 28.6 32.4 29.6 24.3 25.4 29.6 31.5 23.9 21.3 31.5 36.3 24.3 23.3 36.3 44.3 29.8 22.5 44.3 52.2 36.6 22.4 52.2 57.3 41.7 21.3 57.3 62.7 47.1 18.4 62.7 64.9 50.1 17.5 64.9 67 52.5 17.5 67 69.1 53.9 17.2 69.1 72 54.2 16.8 72 74 54.2 17.3 74 75.7 55.3 17.4 75.7 75.7 56.9 16.6 75.7 76.1 57.8 17.3 76.1 77 57.9 17.6 77 79.1 59.5 17.6 79.1 80.1 61.1 17.7 80.1 78.3 59.4 17.4 78.3 77.3 58.4 17.7 77.3 78.8 59.7 17.9 78.8 72.9 53.5 18.1 72.9 56.8 37 18.1 56.8 88.4 69.5 29.8 88.4 73.7 24.2 1.3 73.7 median 72 Huawei P9 Lite median 53.9 median 17.7 median 72 11.1 9.9 1.6 11.1 hearing range hide median show median Pink Noise.

Our comparison chart shows that powerful hardware exhausts the power reserves quicker: The handsets from Samsung ,. all equipped with somewhat weaker SoCs, almost always consume less power than the Xperia XA with its fast. Only the slightly faster Huawei's P9 Lite. needs more energy on average than the review sample..

Due to the relatively high power consumption and comparatively small 2300 mAh battery, the Xperia XA does not have good preconditions in the race for the longest battery life. With 5 hours and 53 minutes in the practical Wi-Fi test, it clearly lags behind most opponents. manages over four and a half hours longer here.. with an even smaller battery is only marginally inferior. Apart from this exception, the review sample takes the last place in all other tests.. Therefore, the Xperia XA's two energy-savings modes are particularly important. The normal "Stamina" mode that limits the handset's performance, background activities, and screen brightness, and also disables vibration feedback is the sensible choice for anyone who wants to use the smartphone as usual. This way, a few extra minutes of battery life could be retrieved from the handset in everyday use. However, this setting did not have an impact on our test of the maximum battery life. The "Ultra-Stamina" mode should result in a much longer battery life, but all online features are then disabled.. We discovered that the smartphone apparently has some emergency reserves in our runtime tests. At a battery state of 1%, it reproducibly remained active for approximately 6% of the total runtime. The Xperia XA supports the quick charging technology "Pump Express+ 2.0" for recharging the battery as fast as possible. However, the necessary charger, UCH12 , is not included, and it was not available in any online stores at the time of testing. The included 7.5-watt power supply needed just under two hours for a complete recharge cycle; according to the display, 70% of the total capacity was reached after roughly one hour..

In review: Sony Xperia XA (F3111). Sony's new Xperia XA mid-range smartphone reaps in some plus points with its good configuration: The 16 GB internal storage is easily expandable with a micro-SD card, the micro-USB port is OTG compatible, and NFC is also on board. However, a fingerprint scanner for unlocking the smartphone comfortably is absent. Photo enthusiasts will probably be pleased with the dedicated release button, and the primary camera's relatively high resolution and autofocus. As common in this category, compromises will have to be made in terms of image quality. We also liked the good performance of the installed MediaTek SoC and bright screen. The recurrent touchscreen issues, however, were annoying during the test. An absolute no-go for many potential buyers will probably be the below-average battery life.. The Xperia XA will primarily catch the attention with its slim line, but the inner values in the form of a fast SoC, bright screen, and expandable storage are also very convincing. It is ultimately the short battery life that ruins the review sample's otherwise decent outcome.. At a market price of approximately 270 Euros (~$302), the Xperia XA is situated within the upper price scale for current mid-range smartphones. in particular has proved to be a worthy opponent in many aspects in the test. It offers some advantages with a larger screen, longer battery life and integrated fingerprint scanner, and it is also available for a starting price of approximately 270 Euros (~$302)..
