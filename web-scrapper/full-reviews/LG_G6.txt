The LG G6 was meant to be LG’s big return to flagship phones, but even though it’s a good device it struggled against the competition.. The LG V30 fixed many of the wrongs here, but there’s hope the LG G7 will go one better.. Rather than the typical 16:9 aspect ratio seen on almost every other smartphone, LG has opted for an 18:9 ratio display (basically 2:1) that provides a taller panel in a smaller body.. The 5.7-inch display – a sizeable increase from the 5.3-inch panel of the G5 – sits inside a shell that’s barely bigger than its predecessor and one that’s noticeably smaller than the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge .. One side effect of cramming a bigger screen into a shell of this size is that the corners of the panel are now rounded, rather than at right angles. It’s a little odd at first, but easy to becomes accustomed to.. It matches the overall curviness of the phone, but looks best on the black model. On my white review unit, the black border between the panel and bezel is fairly prominent, and the corner curves aren’t perfectly circular. It’s a small issue, but once you’ve noticed it, it’s hard to forget.. Related: Best LG G6 deals. The other issue is black bars. Remember when Apple switched the iPhone from a 4-inch to a 5-inch screen? It led to months (maybe years) of apps not fitting the display properly, with many requiring thick black bars at the top and bottom to work. Something similar is happening here, but not to quite the same level of annoyance.. There are black bars on either side when watching YouTube content. For instance, videos from YouTube – which are almost universally 16:9 – have black bars on either side, and media from Amazon’s Prime app has one large bar running along the bottom. Using software trickery it is possible to extend video in certain apps – Netflix, for example – so that films take up most of the screen.. Regular apps are fine, thanks to Android’s native rescaling features, but games will either need to be updated or played with black bars at the bottom. It’s annoying, but thankfully not too distracting. The software layer used for videos is present here, so you can stretch games out to fill the entire screen. It works well, and in titles such as Alto’s Adventure or Horizon Chase , I didn’t notice the difference.. All of LG’s own apps have been updated, and since the aspect ratio is 2:1, the design theme for the UI is two squares on top of each other. This helps Android 7’s native split-screen multi-tasking, providing more space for each app.. However, minor quirks aside this is a very nice screen. To match the stretched display the resolution here sits at 2880 x 1440, and even though it isn’t AMOLED, it delivers vivid colours and deep blacks. It’s the first phone with Dolby Vision support and, like the dearly departed Note 7, it’s HDR10-enabled too.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

Blacks aren’t quite as deep as AMOLED panels, though, and with LG’s huge OLED TV business it seems odd for the company not to utilise its expertise here. Being an IPS LCD also stops it from being compatible with Google’s Daydream VR platform, something that I enjoy immensely on the Pixel.. There were a few demo HDR (high dynamic range) videos on my review sample. Content looks noticeably brighter and darker scenes are more detailed too, but it isn’t quite the jump you’d see on a huge TV. LG says that HDR content from Amazon and Netflix will work, but it will need an app update first. The company hasn’t said when it will be available, but I’ll update this review when I know more.. For the first time I can remember, LG has crafted a phone that looks attractive. The lack of a thick bezel instantly draws the eye, and LG has also ditched that dodgy metal-sprayed plastic that caused so much controversy on the G5.. There’s a slab of Gorillas Glass 5 on the rear (interestingly, it’s only Gorilla Glass 3 on the front), and a metal rim running around the sides, which LG claims adds some much-needed rigidity that’s lost with the unorthodox screen.. The standby switch – with a fingerprint sensor tucked inside – can still be found on the rear of the handset and the volume rocker is on the side.. However, unlike many phones that use capacitive pads, this switch actually depresses and offers decent feedback. Just below the camera is the perfect place for a fingerprint sensor, simply because it’s where my finger naturally rests when I pick up a phone. A major concern I have with the Samsung Galaxy S8 is the strange placement of the fingerprint scanner, which sits directly next to the camera sensor.. My biggest issue with the fingerprint scanner on the LG G6 is actually its speed and sensitivity. Since it’s basically flush to the rear, accidental touches are an issue. Even when the handset is in my pocket, it seems to randomly think I’m pressing the scanner when it’s brushing against my leg.. So the LG G6 is an attractive phone, once you get over the wide-aspect screen. But I worry this novelty will wear thin. We’re bound to see a greater number of phones using this aspect screen this year, as the Galaxy S8 proves, and the G6 lacks the wow factor of Samsung’s curved edges.. Moreover, the black, white and silvery-blue colours in which the phone is available lack imagination, and the glass-backed design with metal sides feels a bit “me too” at this stage. You’ll find it on everything from budget Honor and Alcatel handsets to higher-end devices.. Basically, it looks great from the front, but a little dull elsewhere.. It is water-resistant, however, something I’m starting to demand more and more in a top-end phone. The IP68 rating means it will withstand an accidental meeting with the bathtub or toilet – just remember that the rating only applies to “fresh water”, so swimming pools and the sea don’t count..

CNET también está disponible en español.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good The beautifully design LG G6 is water-resistant with a tall, expansive display and an extra wide-angle camera.. The Bad The phone is LG's first flagship in years without a removable battery. It has last year's Snapdragon 821 chipset.. The Bottom Line The LG G6 is a gorgeous phone and those wary of Samsung should get it.. Editors' note : This review was originally published on April 12, 2017 and has been updated and expanded with direct comparisons to the Samsung Galaxy S8. In high school, being different only works if you're also cool. Otherwise, you get mocked or, possibly worse, completely ignored. After the lackluster reception of its unique, modular-like G5, LG decided not to double-down with another quirky approach to mods. Instead, it reversed course, toed the party line and released the more traditional G6. Gone is that funky hot-swappable chin. In its place is a slim, water-resistant build whose screen takes up an enviable 80 percent of the phone face. For LG, this is the safer but smarter play since the G6 has to do battle with the. OnePlus 3T , the Google Pixel phones and the Samsung Galaxy S8. So does it usurp its biggest South Korean rival, the S8? Not exactly. On paper, the G6 doesn't have as powerful a processor and as long-lasting a battery. LG fans will also be disappointed that said battery is no longer removable (then again, neither is the S8's). And while earlier LG was set to announce its big-screen, small-bezel phone, Samsung's S8 takes the same basic idea and adds more elegance with a unique curved-edge twist.. But Samsung's still dealing with some. Galaxy Note 7 fiasco fallout , and the G6 is a great alternative if you're squeamish about Samsung. Plus, with a $600-$720 (depending on the carrier) price tag, the G6 is about $30-$100 cheaper than the S8. For the first time in a long time, an LG handset stands a fighting chance to be your next high-end Android phone. It may not be popular enough to be Prom King, but it's a no-compromise premium phone with enough mainstream appeal to be on the ballot.. LG G6 is tall, sleek and water resistant. The G6 is LG's nicest-looking flagship yet, which I don't say often, especially given last year's out-there G5. But the polished G6 has a streamlined aesthetic and a smooth unibody design (think the. LG V20 with fewer seams or the G5 with fewer bumps). It's a bit heavy in the hand, but that doesn't bother me much. Like with previous LG handsets, the fingerprint sensor is built into the home button on the back, which sits below the camera (and not next to it, like with the S8). Oh, and don't worry, there's still a headphone jack. The sharp, 5.7-inch screen takes up roughly 80 percent of the front of the phone, leaving it with an impressively thin bezel all around. It's unique in that it has an 18:9 aspect ratio (with the exception of the S8, most phones are 16:9).. With the G6's 18:9 aspect ratio, your eyes will get an extra helping of content to view.. The phone feels expansive and "tall," especially when you're scrolling down your web browser or social media feed. Not all apps and games take full advantage of this ratio though, and when they can't, you'll see black bars on the sides of the display even at full screen, aka "pillarboxing." You can enable "app scaling" on some apps by going into Settings. The longer display works, and seeing that you get more screen for about the same build size, I'm all for it.. In addition to its beautifully glossy design and screen, the G6 is dust- and water-resistant like the S8s, the Apple iPhone 7s and several Sony Xperia phones. It's rated IP68, so you can dunk it in up to 4.9 feet of water (about 1.5 meters) for up to 30 minutes. For the everyday user though, it just means the G6 won't crap out after you accidentally drop it in the pool or spill coffee on it. (Get a deeper dive on IP ratings and what they mean for waterproof gadgets .) I dunked it in a fishbowl and a bucket of water and let it sit each time underwater for 30 minutes. I also placed it inside a shower with the water splashing on it for 30 minutes. In all three instances, the handset kept ticking fine afterward, and it even registered an incoming call during the full dunking.. With the G6, LG dives into waterproofing.. With that said, waterproofing and removable batteries don't tend to go together these days, so the fact that the G6 does not have a removable battery was kind of a given. Still, to longtime LG fans, this might come as a disappointment. After the LG G2 in 2013, the company has been one of the few holdouts to feature swappable batteries in its flagship phones, so people can switch a drained one for a charged one or replace an old battery with a fresh one.. Not having that advantage is a drag, but it's not a deal-breaker for everyone either. LG also hopes that the G6's increased battery capacity (from 2,800mAh in the G5 to 3,300mAh) and new wireless charging feature -- just for the US -- can offset the benefits of a swappable battery. During our lab tests for continuous video playback on Airplane mode, the handset lasted an average of 13 hours and 21 minutes, which is better than last year's 12.5 hours.. The Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ) doesn't have a removable battery either. Samsung's flagships ditched that years ago. Its 3,000mAh battery clocked an average of 16 hours of drainage time. Samsung also said the overall life expectancy of the S8's battery life will last longer as well, years down the road.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Wireless charging on the US model. Only one storage option for most regions. Non-removable battery, unlike previous LG phones. LGâs return to form involves going back to basics. From the unique 18:9 display to the dual camera and excellent overall package, thereâs a lot to like about the LG G6, which sets the standard for flagship phones in 2017.. LG G6 pricing and availability: what we know so far. LG G6 officially announced: everything you need to know. Display 5.7-inch 18:9 QHD+ FullVision IPS LCD display. Cameras Rear: Dual 13MP wide-angle sensor (f/2.4 aperture / 125Â°) / 13MP standard sensor (f/1.8 aperture / 71Â°), OIS 2.0. Front: 5MP wide-angle sensor (f/2.2 aperture / 100Â°), 1.12Âµm pixel size. Wi-Fi 802.11 a, b, g, n, ac. Colors Ice Platinum, Mystic White, Astro Black. Dimensions and weight 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9mm. Last year saw LG bring us the LG G5 , a handset that dared to be different and failed spectacularly in doing so. This resulted in losses for the companyâs mobile division in 2015, and lost market share as Samsung extended its lead and Huawei caught up and overtook the Korean manufacturer.. Now LG is back with another flagship. But unlike previous years, this one takes a rather different approach. Past years have seen LG attempt to stand out from the crowd (and compete against Samsungâs blossoming Galaxy S-series) by being different , yet in 2016 the company has arguably done the opposite. Rather than the leather back of the LG G4 or the ill-fated modularity of the LG G5, the G6 is understated with a design that conforms to the current market trends.. Yet, there is one way the LG G6 is different; its 5.7-inch screen with a unique 18:9 aspect ratio. With other phones expected to also offer the same aspect ratio display later this year, the G6 could prove to be a forward-thinking phone rather than yet another one-hit wonder from LG.. Is a unique display and solid – Â. if muted – package enough to make the LG G6 a must-buy? With a package thatâs mostly identical to the LG V20 , should you buy a G-series or a V-series? Does LGâs decision to ditch the gimmicks and focus on a solid experience pay off? Find out, in our full LG G6 review.. In an effort to bring our readers, and viewers, the most comprehensive review experience possible, the LG G6 was reviewed by two different members of Android Authority. While Lanh Nguyen put together the video linked above, I put together the in-depth written review encompassing both of our opinions to provide the definitive Android Authority view on LG’s latest flagship.. We have both been using a US version of the LG G6 (with wireless charging built in) running the latest pre-final software with OS version 7.0, build number ending D90U and software version ending 709I. Traditionally, we don’t review non-final software but LG has confirmed to us that it is about 95% complete and is ready for review. We’ll be updating this written review with any changes once we get the final retail software update closer to launch.. This year, LG has gone back to basics. There are no more tricks, no more experiments and most importantly, no more modularity.. The LG G6 design formula is rather simple and straightforward, with a sturdy metal frame paired with a couple different kinds of Gorilla Glass. The front features Gorilla Glass 3 protection Â. (as does the camera lens cover on the rear), while the backÂ. cover is made from Gorilla Glass 5. The glass finishes are fingerprint and dust magnets, but this is something weâve now come to expect from most glass phones out there. Fingerprints on the White model are very difficult to discern, while fingerprints on theÂ. On the Black version, fingerprints are most noticeable.. Further reading: The LG G6 uses a four year-old version of Gorilla Glass on its display. Unlike previous G-series flagships, the LG G6 features a unibody design, which unfortunately means the company had to forego the removable battery this time around. It’s a small tradeoff for what you get in return, though – an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.. Personally, Iâll happily take the enhanced durability over a removable battery.. Although the design is new for LG, there are a few flourishes which are atypical of the Korean OEM, including the signature power button on the back that doubles as a fingerprint sensor. It works extremely well, is very fast and accurate to unlock and doesnât require you to press the button to unlock your phone.. On the top of the device, you’ll find a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, which LGÂ. plans on keeping for the foreseeable future as the benefits outweigh removing it. The bottom of the device houses the USB Type-C port and a single speaker, and the right side features the SIM card slot. The volume keys can be found on the left of the device, and not on the back flanking the rear-mounted power button. with placing the power button/volume keys on the back panel of its devices for a few years, but it looks like that experiment has come to a close.. LG G6 is different from previous LG flagships, and that's a good thing.. Overall, the LG G6 is different from previous LG flagships, and that’s a good thing. Rather than attempting to reinvent the wheel, LG has gone back to basics. Opting for a metal/glass construction is a safe choice that’s proven to work, and that’s why LG went with it. After last year, LG needed safe to appeal to the masses, and the G6 does just this.. The standout feature on the LG G6 is the new 18:9 2:1-aspect ratio screen , which, coupled with some excellent design choices, means LG has managed to fit a 5.7-inch display in a body thatâs not much larger than a regular 5.2-inch phone. Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus or Google Pixel XL , the LG G6 is significantly smaller. Itâs truly a feat of engineering that is much easier to appreciate when you hold and use the phone.. The LG G6 offers a one-handed experience thatâs arguably the best of any 5.7-inch phone. LG has made conscious design choices to enhance the one-handed use of the phone, specifically opting for very narrow bezels on the sides, top and bottom. rounded corners for both the display and the outer frame and the result is a one-handed experience thatâs arguably the best of any 5.7-inch phone. LG says the decision to make the display and the frame rounded makes the screen more durable against corner impacts versus a traditional screen with regular corners. The rounded corners do provide a nice aesthetic touch, but as Lanh pointed out, theyâre not perfectly rounded and you can still see a little sharpness onÂ. It doesnât take away from the overall experience, but itâs hard to unsee after you notice it for the first time (sorry if we are the bearer of bad news).. The display is an LCD instead of an OLED panel, but itâs a very good looking display to say the least, and by far the best screen we’ve ever seen on an LG phone. Lanh and I both agree that it has the perfect amount of color and contrast, so it doesnât appear washed out or oversaturated. Rather curiously, the default out-of-the-box wallpaper , which was developed in partnership with Pantone, doesnât do the display much justice, but switching it out to one of the others shows off the display in all its glory.. Since the G6’s Quad HD panel sports an unusual aspect ratio, that means LG packed in a few hundred more pixels than you’d see on a normal 5.7-inch display. If you split the screen in half, you essentially get two perfectly symmetrical squares stacked on top of each other. LG have made some tweaks to the software to take full advantage of this. In landscape mode, for instance, the display splits up into two squares side-by-side; this arrangement makes multitasking a bit easier as youâre able to see more of each app.. The LG G6 is also the first phone to support both HDR 10 and Dolby Vision, which promises to bring an enhanced viewing experience thanks to a much brighter and more vibrant image. Right now, thereâs no content to support either of these standards, but Netflix is expected to update its mobile app to support HDR content in time for the launch of the LG G6, which is likely to be the first of many phones to support these standards.. Spending time with the LG G6âs display does raise a larger issue around the aspect ratio, especially if itâs to become the standard for phones going forward. When youâre consuming content thatâs native to the 18:9 ratio, the experience is fantastic… but when youâre watching content thatâs 16:9 by default (as almost all content is right now), or using an app that doesnât scale to the new ratio, you have awkward black bars on either side.. LG has built in an app scaling feature that lets you force apps to rescale to 18:9, but you wonât use it as much as you might think as it can cause the content to be cut off, which LG does warn you about. Luckily, Netflixâs original series â such as House of Cards â have been shot in 2:1 natively. Plus, as more devices adopt the new standard, itâs likely other producers will follow suit.. Putting it through our testing, we found the display to have a max manual brightness of 556 nits, which is boosted to a very respectable 663 nits when auto brightness is engaged under direct light. In sunlight, this is likely to be even higher and weâve had no issues with legibility in all conditions. Its color temperature of 8281 Kelvin is rather on the cool side resulting in a blue-ish tinge to the whites â which is common to all LCD panels â but this isnât immediately noticeable and the display certainly looks fantastic.. Without doubt, the LG G6’s display is fantastic and hopefully a sign of things to come for future smartphone displays. For years, manufacturers have been trying to make screens larger, but this results in larger phones. With the G6’s rounded corners, slim bezels and 18:9 aspect ratio, we finally have a handset that has a large screen without the big footprint we’ve been accustomed to.. Like most flagships, thereâs also an always-on display which does the job and shows you notifications without first making you turn the screen on. The company has also included a new brighter screen option for the always-on display, but Lanh and I both agree – we’re not entirely sure what this feature accomplishes. It doesn’t appear to make the always-on display any brighter. Now, this could be due to the fact that both devices are not running final software, so we’ll be sure to update this review if we notice any changes.. No, the G6 doesn’t have an OLED panel, but it’s still incredibly vibrant, colorful and a joy to use.Â. Lanh and I both agree thereâs a massive difference between the LG G5 and LG G6 displays and thankfully, thereâs no light bleed either, which weâve noticed on many otherÂ. Overall, thereâs a lot to like about the LG G6 display. Thanks to HDR and Dolby Vision support, itâs at least future-proofed for a few years to come. It may not be the most accurate screen, nor an AMOLED panel, but LG has done more than enough to convince us that 18:9 is the future of smartphone screens and not just a gimmick.. Ahead of the launch of the LG G6, we heard rumors that LG would opt for last yearâs Snapdragon 821 processor rather than the newÂ. Snapdragon 835 , mainly as the latter would require the launch to be delayed several months. As a result, the LG G6 comes equipped with the Snapdragon 821 processor alongside 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU, which is the same package found in the OnePlus 3T and Googleâs Pixel XL, the former being the handset we crowned the best smartphone of 2016!. Don’t miss: LG G6 vs Sony Xperia XZ Premium vs Huawei P10 Plus. Like Googleâs flagship, the LG G6 is smooth and responsive, with almost no perceptible lag. As this is pre-final software, weâre putting the few minor glitches down to the software and weâd expect the final version to be faultless or close to it. Weâve both had a couple of small software bugs â myself with freezing and Lanh with connectivity â but these should be fixed in the final software â weâre merely mentioning them here for total transparency.. The Adreno 530 proves to be a very solid graphics chipset with the gaming experience on par with all major flagships to date. Running graphically intensive games, there areÂ. no noticeable dropped frames and the LG G6 is certainly capable of handling all the games you throw at it. With Vulkan support also built in, youâll also be able to run most games that developers put out in the coming months and years.. Some people may be disappointed that the LG G6 isnât powered byÂ. the Snapdragon 835, but weâve really had no issues with performance; the handset handles everything you can throw at it. While performance may be affected by carrier bloat, the unlocked version certainly delivers as far as performance goes. As Lanh put it: it flies… like a G6 .. The LG G6 comes equipped with 32GB of storage in most markets, which is expandable by up to 2TB using a microSD card slot.Â. Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, NFC and in some markets, an FM radio. The USB Type-C port is v3.1 compliant and supports USB On-The-Go, meaning you can connect a hard drive or USB stick using a compatible adapter (which isnât included in the box).. On the hardware front, thereâs likely to be some contention as LG has opted for different SKUs in different markets, each with different feature sets. The global version has the features listed above but in certain Asian markets, the base model has 64GB storage while other Asian models have the Quad DAC found in the LG V20.. For users in the US, thereâs no Quad DAC or model with more than 32GB ofÂ. storage, but there is wireless charging; the G6 supportsÂ. both WPC and PMA wireless charging standards. Finally, thereâs also a dual SIM model for select markets, again with varying configurations depending on the market. Itâs not the first time LG has done this â the LG G5 was also segregated with the B&O Play module not coming to the US at all â and LG tells us it is down to local markets to decide exactly which features the handset gets. For users in Europe and most countries, youâll get the global model without the additional bells and whistles.. Next to the USB Type-C port on the bottom, youâll find the single speaker. It seems loud for a single speaker, but like all bottom-mounted speakers, you can block it when using it in one-hand in landscape mode. Putting the audio setup through our testing, we find the speaker has loudness of 63.2dB, which is lower than most flagships and significantly lower than the LG G5 which scored 72.8dB.. The headphone jack outputs at 0.396 volts, which is low compared to many phones but better than the LG G5 (0.313 volts), while the noise level of -95.5dBA is on par with most flagships as well. Overall, the audio experience may not seem the best on paper, but it doesnât disappoint in actual usage. While we would have liked dual stereo-speakers, it is certainly more than acceptable as it is.. The switch to a metal/glass unibody design means the LG G6 has a non-removable 3,300mAh battery, which isnât the largest weâve seen on a smartphone but certainly delivers respectable battery life. During our time with the LG G6, weâve both found that the handset is more than capable of surviving a full day of use on a consistent basis.. During Lanhâs testing, he found that even with a heavy usage day â such as using the camera lot with a few hours of gaming â the phone still has 20 to 25 percent battery life left at the end of the day. Personally, Iâve been very impressed by the battery life. On more than one occasion, the G6 has lasted me a full day and almost all of the second. Even on days with heavy usage, Iâve not had to top the battery up at all.. With the G6, we were able to consistently achieve at least a full day of use on a single charge. One of the perceived benefits of the Snapdragon 835 processor is an apparent boost in battery life of up to 20 percent, but this hasÂ. LGâs decision to go with the tried-and-tested Snapdragon 821 certainly seems to have paid off with the battery proving to be reliable and capable of lasting even the heaviest of usage.. For those wondering, weâre both capable of achieving 5 hoursâ worth of screen on time off a single charge and thatâs without really trying to hit those numbers. With some tweaks to usage, it would certainly be feasible to expect six or even seven hours of screen of time.. How does the G6 stack up to our Android Authority battery tests? How does it compare to the competition? In our quick battery test, which tests Wi-Fi browsing, video playback and gaming for 90 minutes and extrapolates the results to simulate a full dayâs usage, the LG G6 scored a very respectable 7 hours and 51 minutes. By way of comparison, the Google Pixel XL scores 5 hours and 52 minutes, the LG G5 scored 6 hours and 31 minutes and the Galaxy S7 Edge scores 4 hours and 16 minutes.. Our next test looks at Wi-Fi browsing with each phone charged to full, the display set to 200 nits brightness and the handset placed a meterÂ. from the router with no app data syncing. A custom web script is then run inside our testing app and drains the handset right down to empty. In this test, the LG G6 lasted for 8 hours and 31 minutes, while the Pixel XL scored 10 hours and 38 minutes, the G5 lasted for 7 hours and 51 minutes and the Galaxy S7 Edge scored 8 hours and 11 minutes.. Another popular use case is video or media playback and for this test, the same testing conditions applied as above with a custom video file set to play on loop inside our testing app. For video playback, the LG G6 scores 8 hours and 56 minutesÂ. while the Pixel XL lasts for 7 hours and 1 minute, the LG G5 for 9 hours and 26 minutes and the Galaxy S7 Edge for 8 hours and 14 minutes.. Our final test is arguably the most taxing as it engages the entire processing package. Gaming is traditionally a sure-fire way to drain your battery rather quickly so in this test, we set a game to repeat its demo mode with the rest of the testing conditions the same. For pure gaming, the LG G6 lasts a very respectable 5 hours and 21 minutes, while the Pixel XL comes in at 4 hours and 43 minutes, the LG G5 at 3 hours and 58 minutes and the Galaxy S7 Edge at 3 hours and 46 minutes.. For the times when you do need to top it up or when you need a quick boost, the LG G6 supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 and the included charger can charge the handset from empty to full in 104 minutes. This is on par with most handsets that support Quick charging, but does pale in comparison to Huaweiâs Supercharge and OnePlusâ Dash Charge, which are both significantly faster.. The LG G6 delivers flagship-worthy battery life. Overall, battery enthusiasts might be disappointed at the lack of a removable battery in the LG G6 but the hefty boost in capacity, coupled with software enhancements and a reliable processing package certainly delivers flagship-worthy battery life. Whatever your usage, the LG G6 should see you through at least a full day’s use.. The LG G6 camera has also had a little upgrade this year but itâs not quite what you may have expected; rather than the customary boost in megapixels or pixel size, LG has opted to reduce the regular camera from 16MP to 13MP and boost the wide-angle camera to the same 13MP resolution. Doing so has meant they can also remove the camera bump, resulting in a camera thatâs flush with the rest of the body.. Parity between the two cameras is arguably my favorite thing about the LG G6 camera; the LG G5 and the V20 both have a large disparity between the two sensors, with the regular sensor capturing 16MP images while the wide-angle shoots at 8MP. As a result, thereâs a noticeable difference in the quality of images captured by both sensors and as LG correctly identified, it made the wide-angle camera the âsecondaryâ camera. As they told us, providing parity between the two cameras means both cameras are now main cameras, and from our time with the LG G6, it certainly delivers on this claim.. They might share the same resolution count but the two cameras are behind two very different lenses; the standard angle is an f/1.8 aperture lens with optical image stabilization and 71-degree field of view while the wide-angle is an f/2.4 lens with 125-degree field of view, which isÂ. lacking in both OIS and autofocus. Thatâs not the only change from last year, with LG also opting to drop the color spectrum sensor as well as swapping out laser autofocus for phase detection autofocus, which works just as well, if not better.. The camera carousel is one of the best uses of the wider screen and shows just how useful 18:9 can be.. The camera app is mostly the same as previous years but thanks to the 18:9 screen, you have the addition of one of my favorite LG G6 features – the camera carousel. Essentially, this provides a preview on the side of the regular viewfinder that lets you see literally every photo youâve taken, versus just the one youâd normally see hidden in the corner on other smartphones. The camera carousel is one of the best uses of the wider screen and shows just how useful 18:9 can be.. Elsewhere around the camera interface, you get the standard button controls at the top to switch between the two lenses that weâve come to expect from LGâs dual cameras. With parity between the two cameras, you can also zoom and change lenses by pinching the display. But, given the fact that youÂ. must pinch until that point, youâll likely find yourself swapping lenses by tapping the button as itâs the fastest and simplest way. The transition between the two lenses is much better than previous years and the middle ground between the two lenses is usable, but youâll likely find yourself opting to use one of the two lenses rather than the middle ground.. The camera tweaks donât stop there as LG has also added a new square camera thatâs perfect for Instagram and comes with a few different modes built into it. One allows you to snap a photo and immediately see a preview of it on the bottom half of the screen while another lets you take multiple photos or short clips that the camera will stitch together automatically. For those who like putting four photos together in a collage, you can take four different photos in the grid shot mode and the camera will do all the heavy lifting.. Both Lanh and I agree that our favourite is the guide shot mode, which allows you to use a premade template or a previous photo as a guide for taking another photo with the same framing or composition. Once you dig into guide shot however, you see that you can also take multiple shots and turn them into a GIF at the press of a button; itâs a hidden feature that only shows up once you take multiple shots in guide shot mode, but itâs by far my favorite feature of the square camera.. For vloggers, video lovers or those who want a little more control over their video, the LG G6âs video recording capabilities definitely deliver. New to the LG G-series is full manual video controls which, until now, had been exclusive to LGâs flagship V-series. Now it looks like LG has finally given users exactly what they wanted. Compared to manual video controls on other smartphones, the LG G6 is miles ahead, with features like focus peaking, hi-fi audio recording and a wind noise filter all making it on-board.Â. For vloggers, video lovers or those who want a little more control over their video, the LG G6âs video recording capabilities definitely deliver.. Without doubt, the LG G6 camera is a lot of fun to use, especially thanks to the wide-angle lens which can really take some breathtaking shots. Itâs amazing how much you can fit into the frame over the standard telephoto lens. The quality of the photos themselves are impressive, with excellent detail, vibrant colors, great contrast and overall good dynamic range. Thereâs a noticeable lack of issues with overexposure of highlights and crushing of shadows that were prevalent in previous LG cameras, so it’s clear the Korean OEM has certainly made a lot of progress with its algorithms and processing.. As fun as the wide-angle lens is, itâs not great in low light which is to be expected from the narrower aperture and lack of OIS compared to the main sensor. In low light conditions, we recommend using the regular angle which can take some equally fantastic shots and produces a much sharper, more colourful and much cleaner image over the wide-angle lens. I personally feel that thereâs still a lot to be desired from the low-light performance on the G6, but given this is pre-final software, Iâm basing my concerns on that, especially as Lanhâs handset performs much better in low-light conditions.. On the front, youâve got a 5MP camera which has a wide 100-degree field of view and you can swap between narrow and wide angles, which makes it perfect for group shots. In daylight, this is more than capable, although highlights are often blown out and shots tend to fall apart and are mostly unusable in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. overly surprising given itâs the front -facing camera, but something to keep in mind nonetheless.. Related: The best Android smartphone cameras. Overall, the LG G6 camera is a joy to use, and, given the right conditions, it can take truly breathtaking photos. Itâs not perfect â no smartphone is, after all â but it delivers quality in abundance. Whether itâs the square camera fun, the two angles or the manual video controls, thereâs a lot to like about the LG G6 camera.. The LG G6 camera is a joy to use, and, given the right conditions, it can take truly breathtaking photos. At the core of the LG G6, you have Android 7.0 Nougat with LGâs UX 6.0 on top. And like every year, a new flagship means a new iteration of the companyâs UI. As a point of note, our pre-release units are running Android 7.0 but weâre led to believe that the LG G6 will ship with the latest Android 7.1.1 NougatÂ. essentially brings a new coat of paint with more natural colors, but still retains the features that weâve come to expect from LGâs phones. The app icons have been updated to square icons with rounded corners for a much more uniform look â and the additional benefit of having square icons on a perfectly square half of the display â while pop-up menus within applications also have rounded corners.. The new icons are designed to complement the rounded corners of the display. While Lanh likes them for the uniformity they provide, I personally donât like them and prefer the natural design of icons. Thankfully, LG provides an option in the home screen settings to display the icons without the backgrounds. This is also where you can enable the app drawer, although it is not enabled by default.. Press and hold the on-screen home key and youâll no longer get Google Now as in previous years; instead, the LG G6 is the first non-Pixel Android phone to run Googleâs Assistant out of the box and provides some very-welcome competition for Googleâs flagship Pixel XL. Sure, Assistant is available on other devices running Nougat and Marshmallow , which takes the shine off it being available on the LG G6, but itâs a nice feature to have nonetheless.. The LG G6 is the first non-Pixel Android phone to run Googleâs Assistant out of the box. LG has also worked with Pantone to create some interesting wallpapers and this is arguably a point of contention for me personally. Without doubt, the display is fantastic but as mentioned, the default â6â wallpaper doesnât really show it off. loads of wallpapers available that truly show off the 18:9 form factor with excellent colors and fantastic composition. If you get the Black, Platinum or the White version, youâll also find thereâs a variant of the default theme to match those colors; on the Black version Iâm using, this results in a truly fantastic black-on-black experience.. As part of its push towards the 18:9 screen, LG has also updated its app to show off whatâs possible with the new aspect ratio. Apps like the calendar and weather both really show off the two squares stacked on top of each other and the calendar especially, is fantastic in landscape mode. The apps also conform more to Googleâs Material Design guidelines than previous years and fit the overall Android experience very well.. With Nougat on board, the 18:9 form factor shows just how good it is for multitasking with the split-view in Nougat proving to be a lot more useful on an 18:9 aspect ratio than the traditional 16:9 ratio, mainly due to the extra amount you can see in each app.. Overall, LGâs software has come a long way over the past few years, and the UX 6.0Â. running on the G6 continues this trend. LG has worked hard to optimize the software for the smoothest experience, thereâs very little bloat on our unlocked units and LGâs own apps and wallpapers are fantastic at showing off the new 18:9-aspect ratio on the screen.. Download: LG G6 stock wallpapers. So, when can you actually buy this phone? We’re not quite sure yet. LG hasn’t revealed all the pricing and availability details as of yet, but we do know it’s coming to the U.S. March 10 is when the handset is coming to Korea , and the current U.S. availability rumors have been pointing to an April 7 release date. We’ll be sure to keep you updated as more information arises.. LG has certainly nailed it with the G6. After the failures of last year, and with the LG V20 still not available in Europe, LG desperately needed the G6 to restore some balance. To do this, theyâve gone back to basics and focused on the things that truly matter to create a solid all-round smartphone, and theyâve certainly nailed it with the G6.. It performs well, has an excellent camera, flagship-worthy battery life and features that people want, such as wireless charging and water resistance. The new 18:9 screen pushes the envelope of smartphone functionality and combined with the super slim bezels, LG has proven that a big display doesnât have to mean a big phone.. If youâve been wanting a phablet in a comfortable form factor, look no further than the LG G6.. 2017 is shaping up to be a fantastic year for Android smartphones. With Samsung, Apple, Huawei and others all expected to bring the very best they have this year, the G6 needed to be a success. Luckily, it does just this, and by setting a new standard for flagships in 2017, LG has laid down a marker that other OEMs need to equal or surpass. LG’s G6 represents the future of what we should expect from a flagship smartphone.. Your source for all things Android!. Â© 2018 Android Authority | All Rights Reserved..

The 5.7-inch LG G6 packs the biggest screen it can in a body narrow enough to hold comfortably, but otherwise falls short on innovation.. The LG G6 fits in your hand. That's an impressive feat for a smartphone with a 5.7-inch display. In addition, the $650 G6 includes many of the features we liked about LG's previous flagships, such as dual rear camera sensors, while adding new elements like a waterproof build and an HDR screen. The question is whether that's enough to break through, especially with powerful contenders like the Samsung Galaxy S8 on the horizon. The G6 is the best phone LG has released to date, but we think it's worth waiting to see what's just around the bend.. The G6 varies in price depending on your carrier. T-Mobile—the carrier we tested on—is the most affordable at $650. Verizon is a bit pricier at $672, with Sprint and AT&T coming in at $708 and $720 respectively. No matter where you buy it, it'll cost a little less than the Galaxy S8 (which is selling for around $750), but probably not enough to make a difference in your decision.. The G6 is an unusually long, narrow phone, with slim bezels and a 2:1 (LG says 18:9) screen aspect ratio. Metal sides combine with a pleasantly grippy glass back that won't easily slip out of your hand, though the black model we reviewed picks up fingerprints and smudges easily. It should be a bit less noticeable on the silver (LG calls it Ice Platinum) model.. There's a standard headphone jack on top (the G6 doesn't feature dual speakers or quad DACs like the LG V20 ), a USB-C port on the bottom, and LG's signature power button/fingerprint scanner on the back, located under the dual camera sensors. A pair of clicky volume buttons are on the left side, while the SIM/microSD card slot on the right worked fine with a 256GB card.. The phone measures 5.9 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches (HWD), weighs 5.8 ounces, and is just narrow enough to reach across with your thumb. Compared with the behemoth Google Pixel XL (6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.9 ounces) and the even heavier iPhone 7 Plus (6.2 by 3.1 by 0.3 inches, 6.6 ounces), the G6 is much easier to use with one hand.. View All 11 Photos in Gallery. It's just a touch wider and slightly heavier than the Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3, 5.5 ounces), which squeezes a 5.8-inch, 18.5:9-screen into its frame. Despite the similar dimensions, t he S8 feels a bit easier to grip thanks to its gently curved display that better conforms to your hand. That said, both phones are sure to please fans of big screens you can comfortably hold and operate with just one hand.. There's no carrier branding on the front or back of the G6, which helps it retain a clean, premium look. Rounded sides spread shock and give the phone some impact resistance. Like the V20, it's rated MIL-STD-810G, meaning it can withstand drops onto hard surfaces. It survived several five-foot drops onto the rubberized floor of our test lab with no visible damage, though keep in mind if you drop it on concrete, you're still likely to crack the glass back.. This is also LG's first phone to be IP68 waterproof. We dunked it and rinsed it off in the sink without any trouble.. As touched on above, the real selling point of the G6 is its 5.7-inch, 2,880-by-1,440 LCD with a unique 2:1 aspect ratio. This means you're looking at a tall, narrow screen. It can be a touch disorienting at first, but you get used to it. And one nice aspect is that when multi-window multitasking, you get a lot more content with each app.. The aspect ratio also means built-in apps have been altered, and there may be some compatibility issues with third-party software that isn't properly scaled. Fortunately, in Display settings, there's an option for App Scaling that lets you pick between aspect ratios of 16:9 (Compatibility), 16.7:9 (Standard), and 18:9 (Full-screen). You're likely to encounter a similar issue with the S8, which has an 18.5:9 aspect ratio.. Stock apps like the dialer, messaging app, address book, music player, weather, and email have been altered to take advantage of the increased screen real estate, usually with larger graphics toward the top of the screen. The camera also gets a bunch of new modes where the top half of the screen is a viewfinder, and the bottom half shows an image preview or lets you coordinate with another image. As the screen can be divided into two square halves, we see some real Instagram potential here.. Samsung may be widely known for having the best displays on the market, but the G6 can give the S7 Edge a run for its money. The screen resolution is 565 pixels per inch (ppi), matching the sharpness of the Quad HD AMOLED panel on the 5.5-inch S7 Edge (534ppi) and Pixel XL (534ppi). But it's not just mere pixel density that makes the G6 stand out. The phone has unusually rich colors thanks to its support for HDR (both Dolby HDR and HDR10). When you see HDR and non-HDR content side by side, the HDR really jumps out.. But despite great color and viewing angles, the screen could use a bit more brightness for outdoor visibility since it's hard to see under direct sunlight. Like the LG G5 , it has an "always on" mode that keeps time, date, and notifications visible when the screen is off, but it's dimmer than Samsung's.. The G6 is available on all the major US carriers. We reviewed the T-Mobile version, which supports GSM (850/900/1800/1900MHz), UMTS (1/2/4/5), and LTE bands (1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/66), giving it good connectivity on T-Mobile and international roaming. We tested the phone in midtown Manhattan where we recorded a top download speed of 9Mbps and an unusually high upload speed of 28Mbps.. The phone also supports dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, and Bluetooth 4.2. The Galaxy S8 is a bit more future-proof thanks to its inclusion of Bluetooth 5.0 .. Earpiece and speakerphone volume are both loud, but calls made with the phone tend to sound a bit robotic. Noise cancellation was good at handling the sound of traffic, but struggled to blot out wind , sometimes resulting in garbled transmissions.. The G6 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor clocked at 2.34GHz, rather than the newer Snapdragon 835. In terms of benchmarks, the phone performs similarly to other Snapdragon 821-powered devices, scoring 136,907 on AnTuTu, which measures overall system performance. That's a bit lower than the Google Pixel XL (140,121), which runs a pure form of Android. It's also lower than the OnePlus 3T (159,144), which benefits from a less-demanding 1080p screen and more RAM (6GB compared with 4GB).. But the main concern here isn't day-to-day performance, as you're unlikely to notice a difference between the G6 and other existing flagships when it comes to multitasking or playing games like GTA: San Andreas. However, the Snapdragon 835-powered Galaxy S8 will not only offer better performance, it'll also support gigabit LTE , letting you take advantage of the faster networks that many carriers are in the process of rolling out.. See How We Test Cell Phones. In most regards, the G6 is an improvement over the G5, but if there's one aspect that may disappoint fans of the series, it's the demise of the removable battery. The 3,300mAh cell in the G6 is sealed in, partly to make the phone waterproof. Thankfully battery life is fairly solid.. The G6 clocked 5 hours, 57 minutes when we streamed full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. It's not as long as the Pixel XL (6 hours, 43 minutes), and falls far hours short of the S7 Edge (10 hours), but it's a big improvement over the V20 (4 hours, 38 minutes). LG has incorporated smart charging technology, allowing the battery to better maintain its charging capacity for over two years. There's a built-in battery-saving mode that turns off the always-on display, reduces screen brightness, and limits background data to save juice. The included adapter supports fast charging, and the phone is compatible with wireless charging pads (not included).. The dual rear camera sensors from the V20 and G5 are back, but LG has made one big improvement: At 13 megapixels each, both cameras are now of equal resolution, so switching between normal and wide-angle shots doesn't compromise image quality. The main sensor offers a 71-degree angle, while the wide lens is 125 degrees. The phone does a smooth zoom between the two cameras, like the iPhone 7 Plus does.. And as with the iPhone, the quality is striking. Unlike on other phones, you don't lose detail when you zoom in. The price is that there's significant barrel distortion in wide-angle shots, with straight lines appearing curved at the edges of the frame.. Noise is minimal and overall quality compares favorably with the Google Pixel XL. Indoors, the Pixel XL has better white balance and color reproduction, taking superior shots in low light. However, the G6 has manual controls, so with some tweaking of ISO and shutter speed you can improve lower-light photos quite a bit from the default settings. The phone also records 4K video with both rear cameras.. When it comes to selfies, the 5-megapixel front-facing camera takes decent shots , but tends to employ a bit too much smoothing while the Pixel XL is sharper and truer to life. A wide-angle selfie mode is 100 degrees, which lets you easily fit some friends in the frame.. The G6 comes running Android 7.0 Nougat , a step behind the newer Android 7.1 you get on the Pixels. LG's software layer is quite heavy. Colors, icons, and much of the launcher have been modified, and LG adds its own gallery and music apps in addition to Google's options. Out of the box, the phone comes with the app drawer disabled and all of your apps strewn across the home screens, but that's easy to change in Settings.. There isn't much in the way of useful new software features. Shortcut keys let you launch various applications by pressing the volume buttons twice, but that's about it.. If there's one thing we've come to expect from carrier phones, it's bloatware. The T-Mobile G6 comes preloaded with seven carrier apps, five LG apps, Evernote, and Lookout. The most egregious is LG Friend Manager, which helps you connect and manage LG's defunct Friends accessories that were supposed to launch alongside the G5. Fortunately, it can be uninstalled, along with most other LG apps, but the T-Mobile ones can only be disabled.. Out of the 32GB of internal storage the phone comes with, you have 20.05GB available for use. Considering the S8 comes with 64GB of storage, the G6 seems a bit short on space. Of course, you can always toss in a microSD card if you need more.. The LG G6 represents the refinement of ideas drawn from the company's previous flagships. You have the dual-camera setup from the G5 and V20, but with both sensors being of equal resolution. You have a large, gorgeous screen that's possible to use with one hand. You also have proven crowd-pleasers like waterproofing, drop resistance, and wireless charging. The losers here are the few, proud, removable-battery stalwarts, who now really have no major phone makers on their side.. All that said, a large, Samsung-shaped cloud looms over the G6. The Galaxy S8, which starts shipping April 21, matches LG's narrow, big-screen approach with a gorgeous curved display, and throws in a Snapdragon 835 processor with gigabit LTE speeds for good measure. It also comes with a custom AI assistant, Bixby , and a small ecosystem of accessories like Samsung Dex and the Gear VR that give it a leg up in both the productivity and multimedia departments. So while LG was smart to get the G6 to market ahead of the S8, it may not be enough of a head start.. Bottom Line: The 5.7-inch LG G6 packs the biggest screen it can in a body narrow enough to hold comfortably, but otherwise falls short on innovation..

LG G6: Specs, problems, availability, and more!. Here's everything you need to know about the LG G6!. After a flirtation with mods in the LG G5 , LG decided to change things up in a big way for 2017. The mods were gone after only one try. Additionally, LG got rid of the removable battery — a long time staple for power users — in favor of an all-glass build. The dual cameras are back and better than ever, as in LG's brand of Android.. This is everything you need to know about the LG G6.. Honestly, the LG G6 doesn't do anything poorly. It's well-designed, gorgeously-engineered, and comes off as a mature, reliable piece of equipment. As MrMobile said in his review , it wears its chunkiness on its sleeve, not trying to hide its metal frame with sloping glass. As a result, it may feel a bit squat next to the Galaxy S8, but I've grown to really love that solidity, both in my hand and my pocket.. The LG G6 has clean strong lines and thick frame leans on the industrial side. Bezels down to a minimum and screen framed with the right amount of chin. Silver has a business classy look to me while the murdered out black reminds me of my LG G2 days and very nice too.. You say the S8 UI looks clean but can't understand how you can say that compared to the G6. The G6 would be closer to stock.... LG G6 second opinion: This one's the best. LG G6, one month on: A great phone, and the best LG has ever made. It's got a big screen, but feels really compact. It's waterproof, drop-resistant, and covered in glass, just like the Galaxy S8. And while it lacks this year's Snapdragon 835 platform, I've yet to worry about its performance, since the Snapdragon 821 — which powers the Pixel and Pixel XL — is still so good, and feels so new .. The bottom-firing speaker is good, the headphone quality is great, as is the call quality and LTE reception. I had some trouble connecting to one particular LG Bluetooth speaker, and the Bluetooth volume was unexpectedly low on another speaker, but that's the extent of the bugs I've found so far.. It's got wireless charging, but only in the U.S. The LG G6 is the first of likely many phones with a non-standard screen aspect ratio. Specifically, its 2:1 (or 18:9, for a more standard comparison) screen makes it considerably taller than most phones out there today, but coupled with the near-elimination of bezels around the bright, beautiful IPS display, it's one hand-friendly.. Contrast is great for an IPS display, an area where Samsung's AMOLED panels traditionally take the lead, and colors are punchy and accurate. Indeed, LG's 2880x1440 pixel screen is Dolby Vision HDR certified, as well as HDR 10 certified, two competing standards that, with the help of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Vudu and others will make it much more pleasant to watch video content on a relatively small phone screen.. How the LG G6 was made. Its two cameras are wonderful and creative. For some reason, LG decided to keep one of its best features, wireless charging, limited to the North American market. It's not a huge deal — most people rely on Quick Charge wired charging through the USB-C port — but it's strange nonetheless. Still, the phone's 3,300mAh battery may need a top-up, wired or wireless, once or twice throughout the day, as we've found the phone to have less-than-stellar uptime compared to phones like the Pixel XL.. These LG G6 features are limited to some regions. Everything you need to know about the LG G6's cameras. Our first LG G6 camera samples!. Only the Korean unit gets the Quad DAC. Like the G5 and V20, the LG G6 has two cameras on the back, each 13MP in resolution but with differing focal lengths, that transition seamlessly using toggles in the simple-yet-powerful camera app.. We've spent some time playing with G6's optics, and while the regular, optically-stabilized is great indoors and out, it's the wide-angle sensor that we've grown to love, especially when taking landscape photos that capture the whole field of view.. LG's also got some really fun camera modes that take advantage of its symmetrical screen, which can be divided into two perfect squares. You may not want to use the word 'twofie', but the phone can take two square photos at the same time using the front and back cameras.. Get a microSD card, because the storage won't last. One of our favorite features from the LG V20 and V30, the Quad DAC that makes music incredibly inviting, full and sonorous, is not coming to the North American or European models of the G6. Citing higher costs, LG says that there just isn't a big market for audiophile components in smartphones — but that doesn't exactly assuage our frustrations.. Fortunately, the LG G6+, which is available as an Amazon Prime Exclusive, has the same Quad DAC in the U.S.!. The launcher is still pretty terrible. Another strange decision, especially in light of the Galaxy S8 coming with 64GB of storage by default — the North American and European LG G6 only comes with 32GB of internal storage, with no option to buy a higher-capacity model. Sure, 32GB should be fine for most people, but it won't last forever, which is why we recommend you buy a big, spacious microSD card for it.. Don't buy an LG G6 without a microSD card. We like the software on the G6 — it's LG's most restrained take on Android to date, and there's very little to complain about. But the launcher, which eschews the app drawer and adds ugly borders around all homescreen icons, is pretty bad.. Our recommendation? Download Nova Launcher, Action Launcher, Evie Launcher , or something that resembles the opposite of whatever LG is thinking.. More: How to make the most of an extra-tall home screen on the Galaxy S8 or LG G6. Black or platinum — doesn't matter. Both colors are really, really nice, and they shimmer and reflect light in their own unique ways. I haven't been a big fan of the generic silver that seems to ship with every phone these days, but LG's take on it, called Platinum, is really something else altogether. And then there's the shiny, fingerprint-friendly black color, which I've been using. I love it; as long as you keep it clean, it's one of the crispest-looking phones I've ever had in my pocket.. There's also a white variant, but it's not coming to the U.S.. Which color LG G6 should you buy?. It's a lot cheaper than the Galaxy S8. The G6 has joined the ranks of other Android phones that are sold by Amazon for $50 in exchange for advertisements being shown on the phone's lock screen. The Amazon version of the G6 is unlocked and ready for use on AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. The LG G6+ is also available from Amazon, costing only $499. For the extra $100 over the Prime-Exclusive G6, the G6+ includes 128GB of storage instead of 32GB, and the 32-bit Quad-DAC that will make your Sennheisers sound like heaven.. More: LG G6 joins Amazon Prime Exclusive for $399 as the G6+ and Q6 make their U.S. Like any phone, the G6 has its fair share of problems, especially when it comes to overcoming some of the endemic software problems LG is known for.. For starters, it doesn't have a super large battery, but there are things you can do — optimizations and such — to prolong the inevitable. And LG's software, while not great, is the best it's ever been — you just have to know how to wrangle it.. Common LG G6 problems and how to fix them. If you want something newer, get the V30. So here we come to the final decision. At between $400 and $500 depending on the carrier, and cheaper unlocked, the G6 is a lot cheaper than the Galaxy S8. That's a lot of money to save on a phone that's better in some ways (it's much easier to pick up off a table, and the fingerprint sensor placement is so much better) and nearly as good in others. The Prime-Exclusive version of the G6 is significantly cheaper at $399, so don't forget that if you don't mind seeing advertisements.. If you've made up your mind, you can learn everything you need to know about the phone in our forums !. Then you can figure out which carrier to buy it from.. Where to buy the LG G6 in the U.S.. The LG V30 comprises a lot of what makes the G6 so good and adds a number of photo- and video-centric features, along with a more powerful Snapdragon 835 chip and a Quad DAC that you don't get with the main G6.. While it's quite a bit more expensive, if you're looking for most of what makes the G6 great, and a bit extra, check out the V30.. LG V30: Everything you need to know!.

CNET también está disponible en español.. LG G6 hands-on: Can the G6 beat out Samsung's Galaxy S8?. LG's G6 packs Google Assistant, water resistance and dual-cameras. But is that enough to outshine the Galaxy S8?. by March 31, 2017 1:00 AM PDT. LG G6 is tall, sleek and water resistant. LG G6 is water-resistant, with a whole lotta screen. LG G6 specs versus Google Pixel XL, iPhone 7 Plus, OnePlus 3T LG G6 is the first phone to feature Dolby Vision HDR The LG G6 has a new camera app for Instagram addicts. Here's how to use it LG G6 hopes to out-iPhone the iPhone 8 LG G6 coming to Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and more. It's a real looker 3. So what's not to like? Antutu v6.2.7. What I think so far LG G6 specs. LG is in a tight spot.. Not only does it have to prove itself after that lukewarm reception of last year's modular-like G5 , but its biggest rival Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S8 just a few weeks after the G6. Given the huge popularity of Galaxy phones in general, and the fact that this is Samsung's first major phone announcement after its exploding Galaxy Note 7 fiasco , it'd be difficult for most companies to outshine the Samsung for attention.. Fortunately, LG's latest marquee handset, the G6, is in a good position to give the Galaxy S8 a run for its money. Gone is that funky modular body (but also the removable battery). In its place is a slim water-resistant build that's 80 percent screen on the front. It's a safer play for LG, which will have to battle the Google Pixel phones and the OnePlus 3T in addition to the S8. (Check out the LG G6 spec comparison here .) For the first time in a while, LG stands a fighting chance against Samsung to be the considerable alternative as your next Android phone.. For one thing, it's cheaper than the S8 by about $30-$100, depending on the carrier. In the US, it will be available to retailers on April 7 and cost about $600 to $720. (The S8, on the other hand, costs about $750. You can also get a Google Home speaker if you jump on the G6 and buy it at an early date (usually by April 30).. There are a lot of reasons you should consider the G6 ahead of the S8 (and two reasons why perhaps you should not). But let's start with what we liked.... The G6 is the company's first dust- and water-resistant flagship. It's rated IP68, which means you can dunk it in up to a meter of water (about 3 feet) for up to 30 minutes. For the everyday user though, it just means the G6 won't crap out after you accidentally drop it in the pool or spill coffee on it. (Get a deeper dive on IP ratings and what they mean for waterproof gadgets .). I dunked it in a fishbowl and let it sit underwater for 30 minutes. The handset kept ticking fine afterward, and it even had an incoming call during its bath. Check back with CNET as we'll continue to test the G6's waterproofness more extensively.. The G6 comes at a time when many of its competitors have already made their marquee phones splash-friendly. The S8, for instance, is water proof with the same IP68 rating.. Dunking the G6 underwater for 30 minutes proved AOK.. The G6 is LG's nicest-looking flagship yet, which I don't say often, especially given last year's G5. But the polished G6 has a streamlined aesthetic and a smooth unibody design (think the LG V20 with fewer seams or the G5 with fewer bumps). It comes in silver, black and white, though the white version will only be available in certain countries, not including the US. Oh, and don't worry, it has a headphone jack.. The 5.7-inch screen is super sharp, with a 1,400-pixel resolution and 565 ppi. It takes up roughly 80 percent of the front of the phone, leaving thin margins all around. It's also unique in that it has an 18:9 aspect ratio, aka: 2:1 (most phones are 16:9).. Not all apps and games can take full advantage of this ratio at full screen and when they can't, you'll see black bars on the sides of the display. You can enable "app scaling" on some apps by going into Settings. The downside is that app scaling will crop content in order to fill the display, and it isn't available for every app (it's an option for Netflix, for instance, but not YouTube). The upside is that you can watch some things or play a few games without generating letterboxes, so the image fills the full 5.7-inch screen. (Look, I didn't promise your life would change dramatically or anything, OK?). LG G6 is tall, sleek and water resistant. The Galaxy S8's screen has a barely-there bezel as well. It also has a higher 570ppi pixel density and is just a smudge sharper. Some might not see much value in having such a high-pixel density, especially to the naked eye. But now that VR and AR headsets are gaining more popularity, phone displays have to be even sharper up close.. Like the V20 and the G5 before it, the G6 has two cameras on the back. But they aren't to take artsy "bokeh" portraits like you do with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. On the G6, you can switch between the standard 13-megapixel lens and the 120-degree wide-angle lens to capture more content in each frame.. If you're really all about that wide-angle life, the 5-megapixel front-facing shooter has a wide-angle option as well. We'll have to spend more time taking selfies to see if image quality is better than last year's 8-megapixel front-facing shooter, but it worked decently enough when we tried it out.. Obsessed with Instagram? LG G6 has an app for you. One of my favorite things about the camera is the option to show five of your most recent photos, like a gallery stream, right on the interface (you'll have to toggle this feature on in camera settings.) LG added a separate camera app too called Square Camera. Aimed at hardcore Instagram users, it offered a number of different tools to take neat square photos. (For more on how Square Camera works, watch the video above and check out our explainer .) The app's features are also tucked in the native camera app under the Auto icon.. The LG G6's camera is brilliant for outdoor shooting. Aside from the Google Pixel phones , the G6 is the only other handset so far to feature Google's signature AI, the Google Assistant, natively. Assistant uses Google's vast search database and voice recognition. You can chat with it and look up things like random facts, the news and nearby places. If you have smart home devices, you can use Assistant on your phone to control the lights in your home or set the thermostat. (Learn more about what Assistant can do on a phone here .). The Galaxy S8 comes with its own assistant as well. Known as Bixby , it has its own dedicated button. Unlike Google Assistant, which emphasizes looking up stuff on the internet, Samsung hopes to differentiate Bixby by enabling it to control a user's phone. So you can tell Bixby to "Find a photo of the SFMOMA. Bixby's abilities are a bit more limiting than Assistant when we tested it out. It can carry out phone-centric commands but can't look up the weather or sports scores. Another advantage of Assistant is that it's deeply integrated with other Google services, like your calendar and Gmail. If you're already in the Google ecosystem (and chances are high that you are), Assistant may be more useful.. Aside from the Google Pixels, the G6 is the only other phone for now to have Assistant built in.. Spec nerds may notice that the G6 features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processing platform , which is the same chipset in last year's OnePlus 3T and Google Pixels. Compared to the 821 processor, Qualcomm's latest 835 chipset is measurably smaller, faster and quicker at recharging mobile batteries.. The Galaxy S8 is equipped with the 835 for some markets. When I benchmarked the 835 in a reference device , it indeed outpaced phones with the 821 (including the G6) by a comfortable margin. However, I'd take these results with a pinch of salt. A final phone equipped with the 835 may not garner the same results. Reference devices are designed for peak performance -- they don't run any bloatware, for example, and they're bigger. This means their insides run cooler, which helps efficiency. And just because the 835 has many new features, it's up to the phone manufacturer whether or not to use them all .. Unless you want to be on the absolute edge of technology, the idea of being saddled with "last year's" processor shouldn't be a huge deal, and the advantages of the 835 isn't that dramatic on paper. In the real world, the usual differences between one superfast processor and another are hardly discernible. And during my time with the G6, it didn't feel any slower than any other premium handset available now.. Second, the G6 does not have a removable battery. Waterproofing and removable batteries don't tend to go together these days, so omitting one of LG's trademark features was kind of a given. Still, to longtime LG fans, this might come as a disappointment. LG has been one of the few holdouts to feature swappable batteries in its flagship phones, so buyers can switch a drained one for a charged one or replace an old battery with a fresh one.. Not having that advantage is a bummer. But it's not a deal-breaker for everyone either. LG also hopes that the G6's increased battery capacity and new wireless charging feature -- just for the US -- can offset the benefits of a swappable battery. (And check back soon when our lab tests for battery life finish for complete results.) The phone can also wirelessly charge when wet.. Though not removable, the G6's battery can wirelessly charge (in the US).. The Galaxy S8 doesn't have a removable battery either. Samsung ditched that for its flagships years ago. And while its 3,000mAh battery is the same as last year's, it may last for a longer time .. LG is closer than ever to being a real threat to Samsung. The G6 may not be as experimental or quirky as its G5 predecessor, but that's not a bad thing. Other than having an "older" processor, it can rival the S8 spec-by-spec because it's playing it safe.. By going with a simple, sleek design, a water-resistant body and a feature-packed camera, LG is giving phone users what they want. Covering the basics may be boring, but it works when you do it right (and even better when you can do it for a cheaper price). In the case of the G6, while it doesn't have anything novel or buzzworthy, it's LG's most marketable and widely-appealing phone yet. Look for my full review of the LG G6 soon..

The LG G6 sets a new standard in smartphone design. The LG G6 proves that big-screen phones can come in small packages. It’s the best Android phone you can buy.. The LG G6 proves that big-screen phones can come in small packages. It’s the best Android phone you can buy.. The LG G6 proves that big-screen phones can come in small packages. It’s the best Android phone you can buy.. Great pictures from the dual-lens camera. All models need Quad DAC, wireless charging, and more storage. There’s a new screen shape in town. Plenty of power and battery life. No Hi-Fi audio for most buyers and not enough storage. A new model: The LG G6 Plus. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Update: We’ve amended the review with a section on the G6 Plus. We’ve also added comparisons to Samsung’s Galaxy S8.. Is bigger better? When it comes to the screens on our smartphones, yes. But when it comes to the body of the phone, not so much. That’s the reason we don’t all carry around a tablet every day. It’s also why so-called phablets often split opinion. laughs in the face of such concerns. It’s the phablet’s worst nightmare, because it puts a massive screen inside a truly compact body, redefining the genre and daring big-screen haters to get over their prejudices.. follow-up to the LG G5 , a phone that similarly attempted to redefine smartphones with its modular construction (but didn’t manage to do so). The G6 isn’t as bold or as risky as the G5, so has LG played it too safe this time? We’ve been using the phone for a week or so, and have plenty to say about it.. Many people struggle to believe the G6 has a 5.7-inch screen, because it feels so small in your hand. It’s easy to stretch your thumb across to the other side of the phone when holding it in one hand, and it remains usable at all times. Try that with any phone with a 5.5-inch screen, and it’s a struggle.. How has LG achieved this feat? It minimized the size of the bezels and chose an 18:9 aspect ratio, making it longer and thinner than the 16:9 aspect ratio screens found on most other phones. It’s the same aspect ratio as Samsung’s Galaxy S8.. The front of the G6 looks very modern, thanks to the rounded corners of the screen. It’s the screen that’s rounded, too, rather than a bezel over the top to give it the look. Combined with the rounded corners of the phone, it helps absorb impacts and lessens the likelihood of catastrophic screen damage. The thin top and bottom bezels make the screen stand out even more, and enhance the minimalist style of the phone. This is a glass and metal phone, with Gorilla Glass 3 on the front, and Gorilla Glass 5 on the back. We are worried that it will break and be expensive to replace, so we highly recommend you buy a G6 case .. Flip it over, and the rear has LG’s trademark fingerprint sensor which doubles as a power button below the dual-lens camera and flash unit. Apart from a subtle G6 logo, that’s it. Our review model is platinum, which looks fantastic, and isn’t the fingerprint magnet you may expect. The phone also comes in black or white. The G6 is thicker than many phones, but not by much, and it gives you a lot more phone to hold on to.. Is the G6 the perfect size and shape for a smartphone? At the moment, yes it is. It combines everything we love about big-screen phones and removes everything we hate about them. There’s no longer a reason to compromise and buy a smaller phone, and no reason to get one bigger than the G6, either. You won’t be prying the G6 out of our hands for a while.. Measuring 5.7 inches and boasting an impressive 2,880 ×. 1,440-pixel resolution, the G6 has envious screen specs; but those cool rounded edges and the overall size of the G6’s screen isn’t what makes it so special. This also equates to a 2:1 ratio, which means two perfect squares fit next to each other on it, something that LG exploits in the user interface.. Why should you care about the aspect ratio? Isn’t that sort of thing just for cine-geeks? It’s actually the movie industry that may end up making-or-breaking the 18:9 screen. Some filmmakers consider it to be the happy medium between cinema and TV aspect ratios, meaning regardless of what screen a video is watched on, it will retain the same look — no cropping to fit — and stay the same as the director and cinematographer intended. More and more video is being watched on smartphones, so this is a major consideration.. The LG G6 is the phablet’s worst nightmare.. For now, there’s a limited amount of 18:9 content online, mostly streamed through Netflix. We watched Daredevil and Marco Polo on the G6, and both looked superb; filling the screen entirely after tapping a special button in a drop-down menu. There’s something very special about seeing a video fill the screen this way. It’s more immersive, more cinematic, and genuinely impactful.. The aspect ratio isn’t the only feature that makes the video experience on the G6 special. It’s the first phone to come with both Dolby Vision and HDR 10 support. This technology previously only seen on televisions is designed to make the image more lifelike with better colors, more accurate contrast levels, and wider viewing angles. There’s not much content out there that takes advantage of it at the moment — it doesn’t make any difference to regular YouTube videos, or the operating system — so it’s only Netflix or Amazon Prime subscribers that may see the benefit.. There’s also the problem with video content that’s not formatted for an 18:9 screen. That content has black bars running down the sides of the video in landscape orientation. If 18:9 video catches on like LG and others hope, this will eventually become less of a problem, but for now, you’ll have to put up with them in most cases. Size oddities aside, the G6’s display is stunning. It’s full of color, detail, and warmth, and a true pleasure to watch.. Although the screen is technically 5.7 inches in size, it doesn’t really look like any other 5.7-inch screen, and some may see the G6’s screen size as a con, due to the taller, thinner aspect ratio. For example, put the G6 alongside the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus and open an app such as Twitter, and the iPhone will display more text and information on one screen than the G6. It’s still a big-screen experience, just unlike those we’re used to.. Android 7.0 Nougat is installed on the LG G6, and our pre-production review model had the March 2017 security patch installed, making it right up to date. LG’s user interface is placed over Android and has a few additions to make better use of the 18:9 aspect ratio screen. Android purists will note changes to the notification shade, the Settings menu, and the option to enable the app tray, or spread apps across multiple home screens. LG also provides various themes to match the color scheme of your G6, which change backgrounds, wallpapers, and icons.. The G6 is ideally suited to multi-window app use, providing a perfect square for two apps to live in, and it’s easy to activate using a long press of the Android menu key. LG only installs a few of its own apps, such as QuickMemo+, which handily syncs with Google Drive, LG Health, a Tasks app, and its own messaging, music, file manager, and calendar apps. Additionally, there’s an FM radio app, and an audio recorder. Many of LG’s own apps make use of the 18:9 aspect ratio. The Gallery app takes up the whole screen, for example.. It’s LG’s Square Camera that’s the most interesting. It splits the screen into two, with the top half for square format pictures and the lower half for previews, or custom shots. It’s a shame Square Camera’s functionality wasn’t built into the main camera app, because many people will miss it.. The square is broken down into quarters, each filled with a still image or a three-second video clip, which when put together tells a neat little story. There’s plenty of room for creativity here, and best of all, the result can easily be shared on Facebook or Twitter, with videos intact. This is essential, and a problem Apple hasn’t overcome with its similarly fun Live Photos feature. If you can’t share them with your friends, we question whether it’s worth it at all.. Other features in Square Camera include Match Shot, which is like Grid Shot but with two pictures instead of four, and Guide Shot for matching photos using a handy transparent overlay, so people can capture the same pose or composition on multiple occasions.. A long press on the home button brings up Google Assistant. The G6 is the first to use the Assistant outside of the Pixel phones, ahead of its wider release on other Android 7.0 Nougat phones. We’ve reviewed a version of the G6 that has software which is 95 percent ready for release, meaning there may be some alterations when the phone goes on sale. However, we experienced no stability or compatibility problems.. While LG’s user interface does deviate from standard Android, it’s not unpleasant or slow. Thought and effort has been put into the icon design when you change themes, the color choices that match the body, and the icon curves that match the shape of the screen. LG’s UX 6.0 looks fantastic, and we never felt a desire to change the launcher on the G6. The G6 has up-to-date software now, and we hope that will continue in the future, but that will be down to LG’s update schedule , which unfortunately may lag behind Google’s.. There are two camera lenses on the back of the G6, both with 13 megapixels. One boasts a wider-angle lens than the other. The 125-degree wide-angle lens doesn’t have optical image stabilization and it has an f/2.4 aperture, while the 71-degree standard lens has OIS and a far better f/1.8 aperture.. You get two different experiences when taking pictures, especially in low light, when the standard angle lens produces pictures with more detail and less noise. However, the G6 can take some fantastic nighttime or evening shots, adding drama and atmosphere in the right environment. Used creatively, and with the right lighting, the wide-angle lens is also more than capable.. LG’s UX 6.0 looks fantastic, and we never felt a desire to change the launcher.. In daylight, the G6’s camera didn’t enjoy overcast days at the end of British winter time, and struggled to manage contrast — eventually settling on washing out the sky and darkening the landscape. It’s not ideal, and something we’re hoping will be cured when the final software build is released. We also found the screen itself didn’t do the photo justice, and it often ended up looking better than expected when we checked the gallery. Again, something that’s likely to change with a software update. We’re noting it here in case nothing changes.. Show the camera a blue sky, colorful plants, or any close-up material, and it shines. Using the phone in Spain after the launch, we compared the G6 to several other phones including the Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus, and found it produced the best image in several different tests. Most of the time, it came very close to matching the Pixel XL, a highly rated camera phone.. Taking photos with the G6 is enjoyable and addictive, and the wide-angle mode presents new creative opportunities. There’s a manual mode for both stills and video, if you’re confident enough to change settings in search of the perfect picture. LG hasn’t included an editor, though, and you’re given the choice of using Google Photos or a third-party app, such as Snapseed instead.. The G6’s selfie camera has 5 megapixels and a single 100-degree, wide-angle lens, and like the main camera the two modes are alternated using a button on the screen. There are also several filters to apply, and a chance to manipulate skin tone and artificial lighting sources. While capable enough, selfies taken with the G6 can’t match those of the Huawei P10. The wide-angle lens makes it easy to take great group shots, though, and goes along way to redeeming the front cam’s ability.. LG has also made good use of the extra screen in the camera app, using the top edge (or side edge in landscape) as a preview gallery, showing the last four pictures taken so you don’t have to jump into the gallery app to see them.. The LG G6 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor inside, plus 4GB of RAM. There will be those who mumble complaints about the Snapdragon 821, whining it’s not a super-new Snapdragon 835. Don’t be one of these people. Ever used the OnePlus 3T or a Google Pixel? There’s more than enough power inside both those phones to keep them fresh for ages, and they both have the 821 inside. LG made the decision to use the 821 in order to get the phone on sale quickly, rather than over the summer, and it shouldn’t put you off at all.. An AnTuTu benchmark result returned a score of 135,032, and 3DMark’s Slingshot Extreme test saw it score 2,102. These are around the same as the scores attained by the Pixel XL, but fall short of the OnePlus 3T. It’s also very close to the LG G5 and the Samsung Galaxy S7.. Other complaints will be made about the lack of removable battery on the G6. However, even though the G6 is now a sealed phone, that has given it an IP68 water and dust resistance rating. While having a replaceable battery is great, having to replace the entire phone after you spill a drink all over it isn’t so great. Yes, you’re trading one feature for another, but additional durability protects your purchase instantly, and there are plenty of battery packs out there to buy.. When we first started using the G6, the battery life was poor, barely lasting a mid-to-heavy use day. A software update has improved the situation, where we’re seeing 25 percent of the battery remaining after the same level of use in a single day. That includes photo work, social networking, games, and navigation. Buying the G6 in the U.S. will see your phone come with wireless charging, a feature not included on international versions of the phone. Using the supplied charger and USB Type-C cable charged the 3,200mAh cell reach capacity after about an hour and 30 minutes.. Watching stunning video is what the G6 is made for, so how about the audio experience? Sadly, it falls short of the video performance. It doesn’t have stereo speakers, just a single one at the base of the phone, and there’s no Dolby Atmos, or even standard Dolby Audio tweaks. The single speaker does a decent job, but it’s overshadowed by the iPhone 7 Plus , Boomsound speakers on any HTC phone, and cheaper hardware like the ZTE Axon 7 and 7 Mini. It’s a shame, when what’s on screen looks so fantastic.. The wide-angle mode presents new creative opportunities.. Additionally, LG has restricted the Quad DAC to devices for sale in South Korea only. LG G6 phones sold in the United states get 32GB of internal storage and a MicroSD card slot as part of the SIM tray, but internationally, larger capacity versions will be sold. LG G6 phones in Europe have neither the Quad DAC or wireless charging.. We’d much rather a single model with all these features inside. LG says the localization is based on buyer preferences, and ensures the price of the phone is kept competitive in different regions.. maintain competitiveness with Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and HTC’s U11 , LG has released. an upgraded version of the LG G6 with. beefier hardware, new software features, and a premium pair of bundled earbuds: The LG G6 Plus.. The LG G6 Plus looks identical to the original G6 from the outside, but that’s where the similarities end. RAM (from 4GB to 6GB) and internal storage (from 32GB to 128GB), the G6 Plus supports Low Power Consumption mode, which leverages Google’s Contextual Hub Runtime Environment (CHR) and LG’s All-Ways Aware hub to collect data from the device’s sensors continuously without impacting performance or battery life.. On the software side of things, the G6 Plus boasts Face Print, which lets you unlock the phone with your face in less than a second, and LG Pay, LG’s mobile payments platform. Another feature, Covered Lens, alerts you if you accidentally block the camera with your finger.. The G6 Plus comes in a new color — blue — with a lenticular coating that produces a shimmering effect when you view the phone from different angles. Every model ships with Bang and Olufsen earphones that take advantage of the phone’s 32-bit Quad DAC.. The LG G6 Plus will only be available in South Korea at the moment, and we’ll update this review when we get pricing and availability details.. Verizon started selling the G6 for $672 on. March 17, and shipped it out the door on March 30. The phone is available now at. AT&T ($719) and Sprint ($708), and through T-Mobile for just $650. Cellular offers it for just $550. LG traditionally gives you a one-year warranty on smartphones, which covers either repair or replacement, plus any labor charges. You’ll have to send it back to LG if it goes wrong, though. The G6 is also now available unlocked straight from LG, and if you want it unlocked you’ll need to pay $600. You can get the unlocked version from LG or from Amazon .. on April 24, including the U.K., France, and Germany. LG has secured 33 partnerships with networks, so the phone should be easy to find. In the U.K., it’s sold through EE and Three , and Carphone Warehouse. Plans cost from around 30 British pounds each month for 24-months, or a SIM-free unconnected G6 is around 650 British pounds.. Thanks to the LG G6, having a big, beautiful screen doesn’t mean enduring an oversize phone anymore, and it’s wonderful.. As of this writing, the LG G6 is one of the best Android phone you can currently buy, but far from the only one.. The Galaxy S8 , Samsung’s $750 flagship, is. packed to the brim with cutting-edge tech. It boasts Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor, a stunning curved screen, an iris scanner, and Samsung’s Bixby digital assistant. Its camera falls short of the G6’s dual-lens shooter, to be fair, and it doesn’t have have. Dolby Vision and HDR 10 support. But if the Galaxy S8’s larger footprint doesn’t bother you, it’s one heck of a compelling alternative.. is the obvious alternative for stock Android fans who dislike any customization. It costs $750, has a Snapdragon 821 processor, Android Nougat, and Google Assistant, plus a highly capable camera. What it doesn’t have is the G6’s sleek body and gorgeous new screen, or a wide-angle camera lens.. is a strong alternative to the G6 if you want to save a lot of money. It also has a Snapdragon 835 processor, plus 4GB of RAM, an AI assistant, noise-canceling audio tech, and a $650 price tag. There aren’t any camera bells and whistles, but it still takes solid shots.. It has the same size screen, similar wide-angle camera setup, a degree of durability, and the removable battery. LG’s G6 should have a long shelf life of at least two-to-three years. The software is right up to date, and it has Google Assistant already installed, meaning there’s no need to wait for an update. Updates in the future may take longer to arrive than on a Pixel phone, though. That’s our only concern and reservation in recommending the G6 over the Pixel XL.. The processor is the only sticking point. We always like to have the latest hardware and software, because it ensures the phone will last many years if we want it to, but the Snapdragon 821 won’t remain Qualcomm’s top chip for much longer. It won’t suddenly stop working, and your phone won’t suddenly react like it’s pedal-powered. However, if bragging rights are your thing, it’ll soon lose out to the Snapdragon 835. That said, the 821 is tried and tested, unlike the 835.. The G6 is not only the first major flagship smartphone out in 2017 that we really adore, but it’s also a return to what makes us love LG phones — subtle yet beautiful design, a brilliant standout feature, and a cracking camera. The software is good, too, with Google Assistant installed rather than a third-party or untested alternative, ensuring it works cohesively throughout the phone. Best of all, it’s compact and easy to use with one hand, but offers a screen larger than its direct competitors. We love it, and think you will to.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. A great screen in a stylish body. The G6 is a great phone from LG, one that pushes the brand back to the forefront of the smartphone pile in terms of design and screen. However, lower-spec performance and not upgrading the camera in a meaningful way while still charging a huge premium make this a tough sell.. LG G6 price and release date Out now Costs around $550/£580/AU$1000 SIM free Design. An understated and sophisticated metal and glass build Impressively small bezels Water and dust resistance. With the LG G6, the modular design of the LG G5 is gone in favor of a more traditional phone, one that takes multiple elements from the top handsets around, blended together to make a more prosaic (but still intriguing) handset.. The G6 is a much more conservative design than its predecessor, taking the form of a sealed unit that drops the removable battery, replacing it with a larger-capacity power pack and waterproof shell.. Surprisingly, this phone isn't using the latest chipset from Qualcomm, so you won't be getting the full grunt of the Snapdragon 835. However, LG maintains this was a decision to benefit the consumer – using a chip it had expertise with rather than an unknown entity it couldn't test fully.. Instead, it's going with a Snapdragon 821 option, which LG told us was a better option given it had more experience working with the chip and could thus extract more performance rather than using an untested engine.. The screen is, really, the only place where innovation is still present on the G6, with the longer 18:9 display giving more screen real estate to play with, and introducing some clever little changes to the user interface to exploit the extra pixels.. Beyond that, there's not a lot that marks out the LG G6 from the rest of the competition – and that's a pretty good thing.. Having used the LG G6 for a couple of weeks, it's easy to see that this is a 'grown-up' handset from the South Korean brand. It just feels nicer in the hand, more solid and refined, and we really haven't missed anything from the LG G5 at all.. Early prices were as high as $650/£649/AU$1000, but they're already starting to drop, and while it's still an expensive handset LG seems to have baked all the components together well, so at least you'll be getting a decent phone for the money.. It’s interesting that some reviews have called the LG G6 a 'return to form' - apart from perhaps the LG G2 , the brand hasn’t had a stellar flagship device for years. Rather, it feels more like a ‘finally understanding what users actually want in a phone’.. Update: The G6 isn't the only hot LG phone brought to market recently. Arguably, its biggest phone of 2017 was the LG V30 , which sits rather high up on our list of best Android phones. Unfortunately for the G6, the V30 is so good that it has kicked it right off the list. But who knows? Maybe the LG G7 will end up taking the V30's place.. Interestingly, some recent rumors surrounding the G7 claim that LG has rebooted its development several times in the search for the next big thing. One such rumor states that the next phone in the G series might not even be called the G7. With MWC 2018 coming up, we probably won't have long to wait until we see what's next.. We've added comparisons to the top phones the LG G6 is competing with, including the Samsung Galaxy S8, Sony Xperia XZ Premium and HTC U11, so you can get a clearer picture of how they differ and which is most worth your money.. Lastly, LG has brought more color options for the G6. You'll now be able to pick up the phone in Moroccan blue, violet, and rose in addition to its launch colors of silver, black, white, gold and a different shade of blue.. OK - here's the curious thing about this phone. It's got a lower-spec in some areas, has prioritised things like design over an improved camera... and yet still costs far more money than we'd expect.. The LG G6 has an eye-watering £649 SIM free RRP in the UK, which is astronomical given we're used to seeing phones from this brand come in at almost half that cost after a few months of being on sale.. In fact, that might happen again, as many retailers have already dropped the price to a still-steep £580.. In terms of contract pricing, we're looking at around £38 per month minimum if you don't want to spend too much on the phone upfront, which again is rather high.. In the US, contract pricing is set at around $28 per month, which is in the region of Apple's iPhone 7 and the Google Pixel... both of which aren't considered cheap phones.. If you want to go for it SIM free in the North America, you're looking around $550 (down from a launch price of roughly $650), where it's AU$1,000 for those over in Australia.. For a limited time, you can trade in your old phone at Verizon to get the G6 for 50% off, which is a pretty tempting deal.. The LG G6 release date has already been and gone for most territories, with the UK one of the last to get its hands on the device - we're hoping that as it becomes more widespread, the cost of ownership continues to come down.. The LG G6 is covered in a mix of glass and metal, with two sheets of Gorilla Glass (although weirdly it's Gorilla Glass 5 on the rear, but only the much older Gorilla Glass 3 on the front) framed with a rim of aluminum.. What's most impressive is how little bezel there is on this phone – we've now seen the same kind of design from Samsung on the Galaxy S8 , but the narrow bezels have been shrunken top and bottom to create an impressive effect when you turn the phone on.. Anyone aware of the LG G5's design will be surprised by just how… normal this phone looks. Gone is the dull plastic back of the LG G3 , the odd leather of the G4 or the come-apart design of last year’s phone – the LG G6 is smooth and classy all the way around.. That will disappoint those who like the way LG has taken things in a different direction in the past, but honestly, the G6 design is a smart move. It’s the most classically understated and sophisticated phone we’ve ever seen from LG, and it’s the perfect platform for letting the internals shine through.. And it's got the features that matter, like IP68 certification for water and dust resistance - a common flagship feature that was missing from the LG G5.. The rear of the phone is smooth, with no protruding camera bump – we’ll get onto the snapper in a moment, but LG told us it chose slimmer sensors rather than more advanced camera tech to make the design of the phone sleeker.. It's a gamble, but last year's camera was fine, and LG can probably just get away without another change.. There are two sensors on the rear of the phone, above the round fingerprint sensor, which also doubles as a power button.. The LG G6 is currently available in platinum, black, white, Marine Blue, and gold. But recently, Moroccan blue, violet and rose were added to the roster.. The platinum is the most alluring of the colors, with a metallic sheen under the glass that catches the light nicely. However, the white option, with two cameras and round fingerprint sensor below, makes the G6 look a bit like a surprised ghost.. At the bottom of the phone is the single speaker next to the USB-C connector – and LG has kept the headphone jack at the top, declining to bow to the industry trend of dropping the connector as it keeps more 'traditional' (read: everyone) music fans happy.. Some LG phone lovers will be distraught, however, to find that the battery is now sealed into the handset – LG has finally given up on the removable power pack in order to put in a more powerful and slimmer juice unit.. It’s been increased to 3,300mAh within the slimmer 7.9mm frame – and it’s the right move. The need for removable power packs is almost dead thanks to the proliferation of portable battery chargers, but its V-series phones (such as the LG V20 launched last year) keeps the option for now.. MicroSD support still exists, with the up-to-2TB expansion option thrust into the SIM tray, and complementing the 32GB of onboard storage; however, it's really annoying that you can't adopt the storage from the memory card and use it as internal memory like other phones allow you to do.. The design of the LG G6 is certainly more refined - it does feel a bit light and over time the glass back feels more like plastic. That creates slightly sweaty digits, and there have been times when the fingerprint sensor has needed a wipe to function correctly.. However, that sensor is in the right place - rarely was there a misplaced finger when trying to unlock the handset, and the ring on the outside was easy to hit..

Offer Type: Standard Version | Color: Black | Verified Purchase. Full Disclosure - I am coming from a Google Pixel XL, got this as a second phone, so it has a lot to live up too, also i got this for $450 which makes it a great deal at that price point, since LG built the Pixel 2 XL and was in part based on this phone and the v30... one can almost consider this the working mans Pixel 2 XL. I got the correct unlocked version of this phone, thank you very much.. The phone itself is very good, with the screen and overall modern 18:9 design and the wide angled lens being the stand outs... cons are the middling battery life and LG software (which is easily changed) The auto-brightness feature is well just terrible, forcing the screen from barely readable dim to super bright sometime with very little reason, under work florescent lights the situation is the worst and i just keep it at 50% non auto, when at home with softer lighting the brightness works much better and i keep it on auto... consider installing lux from the play store, which has far superior brightness management IMHO. The wide angled lens camera option is great in fact i wish in the future more smartphones would implement this to get much wider exceptional views and good closeup and mid range, a big plus... the standard camera lens is pretty good, not Pixel level good, but def above average. I didn't care for the native LG software and quickly replaced with nova launcher and the Pixel launcher with Google feed... and then replaced most of the default LG apps (calendar etc) with their much better Google counterparts... the phone is butter smooth with non of the Samsung "lag" and slowdown, LG really knows how to optimize in this area, kudos. Biggest let down is the middling battery life, you can optimize this phone, but it will just barely get you through the day with mixed use you'll get about 3.5 hours SOT before needing to hit the charger which itself is very quick USB-C 3.0 quick charge BTW... For a 2017 flagship this is just not that great with 5+ hours SOT being pretty standard these days as a reference point. For most people this will be just fine, phone tinkerers and power users will need to charge by evening. Overall this is a very good phone, the design is wonderful and modern... very premium yet light in hand, it is kept from greatness by the middling battery life and LG software... The camera is good but the 2nd wide angled lens is great.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars A Great Android Phone. Offer Type: Standard Version | Color: Black. I waited until I used the G6 for nearly two months before writing this review. I wanted to see how it held up. The G6 is one of those rare phones that hit when a maker looks back at their pervious phones, picks the best parts, and just goes with it. PROS Nice Screen, Awesome Camera, Water Resistant, Solid Build, Good Performance, Wireless Charging, Headphone Jack CONS Terrible Launcher, Too Many Junk Apps, Average Battery Life, 32GB of Storage, Mono Color Flash As it stands now, the 18x9 screen looks nice, but it’s more of a gimmick than anything else. Very few little content / apps are available in a 18x9 format. The LCD screen gets the job done and looks nice, but I can’t help but wonder what this phone would look like with an AMOLED. You’ll ask that question at night, if you are using always on display. You’ll notice some light bleed that is very hard to avoid with an LCD screen. The camera on the G6 is one of the best you are going to find on a smartphone in 2017. Not only is the quality top notch, but it’s usable. A lot of dual lens phones use both for bokah or image enhancement. LG has proven that you do not need two lenses for that. Instead they deliver the stellar wide angle lens to supplement the standard lens. It makes for a powerful duo and leaves me wishing that others would adopt a similar format. The G6 feels good in your hand. It feels much more solid than the G5 did, thanks to its solid, one piece construction. The design meant going away from the removable battery, which is a big drawback for some, but it also allowed them to make the phone water resistant. I’ll take that any day over a removable battery, especially now that cheap, compact battery packs are so readily available. The wireless charging is a feature I love, but there is an oddity here. You only get that in the US version. In fact there are a couple versions of the G6 out there depending on where you live. For the price, it would have been nice to merge all the features together and only offer one model. Instead you are stuck deciding if you want more internal storage, wireless charging, or high def audio. LGs biggest weak point is its software. Why can’t they adopt Motorola’s philosophy? I like a phone that is close to stock with no duplicate apps and no bloatware. The G6 is neither of those. The stock launcher is a total nightmare. You can quickly add the version with an app drawer, but it’s not much better. You’ll get very few options to customize anything. You’ll quickly find yourself downloading Nova Launcher or the Google Now Launcher. I’ve forced myself to use the standard app drawer launcher that LG provides since it was designed to work with the phone, but it’s not great. The battery life is about average. I list that as a con, because this is a flagship running an 821. It should be better than average. I went to this from a Moto Z Play. The SOT difference between the two phones is about 7hrs. The average user is not going to notice the performance difference between the two phones, only the battery life. Power users are going to see the performance difference. 32GB of storage might seem like an okay option considering this phone also has expandable storage. Here is the problem with that – if you add enough storage, you don’t need also have expandable storage. For a flagship 64GB is quickly becoming standard and many makers have started offering higher options. I honestly think this is going to be one of the last flagships we see with 32GB of storage. I haven’t had a phone with a single color flash in years. The last ten phones I have used have had a dual or even a triple color flash, and for good reason. The flash on the G6 will wash your subjects out. It’s a little thing, but little things can make or break a flagship. Should you buy this phone? The price of this phone has been dropping like a rock. If you can land it for less than $500, you’ll have an amazing phone in your hand at a good price point. Overall this is an amazing phone. It could have been the best, but a few cut corners kept it from being as good as it could have been. For those of you who really like to take photos with your phone, this is the one for you! SIDE NOTE – This phone does not have an IR blaster. I want to mention that since some users love the functionality that comes with an IR blaster.. Was this review helpful to you?. Bought this recently as "Very Good". It hasn't had any problems and works perfectly. 5.0 out of 5 stars It's Grrrrreat!. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Bought it 2 weeks ago and was waiting to see its performance. Well the phone came well packaged in black, the best front camera and incredible features. 5.0 out of 5 stars Runs fast and beast camera. I got this phone for use on the Verizon network and haven't had any proboems. Phone works great, I'm really loving it. 5.0 out of 5 stars Phone works great, I'm really loving it. Great unlocked phone! Buy it without a doubt. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Bought this phone a year ago on sale for $450 and I'm not disappointed. Phone still holds a charge very well. After 8 hours of streaming music at work I'm at about 75% battery. 5.0 out of 5 stars ... year ago on sale for $450 and I'm not disappointed. Phone still holds a charge very well. 5.0 out of 5 stars Successful Christmas Present!. The USB port on the phone went out after less than 6 months, not of my fault. Carrier wants $100-200 for a refurbished even with insurance and within warranty period. 1.0 out of 5 stars Poor quality product, with even worse support when something goes wrong.. Upgraded from an iphone 6 to this and it is worlds better. Had it for months now and it keeps up with the best for much less money. 5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome phone. Loved the phone when I got it, but learned quickly that verizon could not activate this phone, so word to the wise make sure the phone can be activated. 4.0 out of 5 stars Nice phone, no service.

Android Police — The LG G6 gets tortured by JerryRigEverything, emerges mostly unscathed. Wikimedia Commons has media related to LG G6. Not to be confused with SGS6 or Like a G6 .. G6: 4 GB LPDDR4 RAM. 13 MP (f/1.8, OIS, 3-axis) + 13 MP (f/2.4), active autofocus, LED flash. The LG G6 is an Android smartphone developed by LG Electronics. It was announced during Mobile World Congress on February 26, 2017, as the successor to the 2016 LG G5 .. The G6 is distinguished by its display, which features a taller, 18:9 aspect ratio than the 16:9 aspect ratio of most smartphones. A variant, called the LG G6+ was announced on June 19, 2017 with 128. The LG G6 utilizes a metal chassis with a glass backing, and is IP68-rated for water and dust-resistance. It is available in black, white, and silver-color finishes. The G6 features a 1440p FullVision IPS LCD display, with a diagonal size of 5.7 inches. LG stated that it intended for the G6 to be a large-screened phone that would still be compact and feasible for one-handed use; the display uses a 2:1 (marketed as 18:9) aspect ratio that is taller than the 16:9 displays used by the majority of smartphones. The G6 was also designed with slim bezels, and is slightly smaller in size than the G5. [3] To allow for reinforcement around the corners of the display, the display panel itself has rounded edges. [4] [5] The display also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision high-dynamic-range video. The G6 utilizes the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 system-on-chip with 4. It is offered in models with 32. GB of internal storage, expandable via SD card. The G6+, on the other hand, comes with 6. GB RAM and 128 GB internal storage standard. mAh battery; unlike the G5, it is not user-accessible. models will support wireless charging , and all models will support Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0. [6] Models in selected Asian markets will include quad Digital-to-analog converters (DAC) to enhance sound output. [6] The G6 drops the modular accessory system of the G5, which had been panned by critics. [5] [4] [3] Similarly to the G5, the G6 features dual rear-facing cameras, with standard and wide-angle sensors. Unlike the G5, where the wide-angle sensor had a smaller megapixel size, both cameras utilize 13-megapixel sensors. LG G6 ships with Android 7.0 "Nougat" and LG UX. Some of LG's in-house applications have enhanced landscape modes intended to complement the 2:1 display; the camera app features shooting modes designed for use with square, 1:1 aspect ratio photos, and can display a camera roll sidebar when taking traditional 4:3 photos. [5] [4] The screen size also complements Android Nougat's native split-screen mode for running multiple apps at once. [3] LG announced that it would provide a promotional "G6 Game Collection" offer with US$200 worth of in-game content for six games on Google Play Store ( Cookie Jam , Crossy Road , Genies & Gems , Spider-Man Unlimited , SimCity BuildIt and Temple Run 2 ), oriented towards those built for one-handed play and optimizations for the aspect ratio. CNET contrasted the G6 from the previous year's G5, as well as its main launch competitor, the Samsung Galaxy S8. The design of the G6 was complimented for being more elegant and expansive than the G5, albeit less elegant than the similar but curved design of the Galaxy S8. LG was panned for its shift back to a non-removable battery, but the battery itself was praised for having a larger capacity than that of the G5. It was acknowledged that while the G6 does not include the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip (making the Galaxy S8 perform better on benchmarks than the G6), there was no discernible difference in performance in real-world usage between them. The cameras were also praised for producing "sharp and vibrant images", with quality on par with other recent flagship phones. In conclusion, CNET felt that the G6 could appeal to users that had lost their trust in Samsung following the recall of the Galaxy Note 7 , arguing that "while it doesn't have anything novel or buzzworthy, it's LG's most marketable and widely-appealing phone yet."

LG G6 Release Date, Price, Specs, Features, Rumors, News & Preorder, Review. The biggest event in the world of technology has kicked off. And we are here with the first big launch of the year – the LG G6. It has been quite some time that we have been receiving news and updates related to the probable features of the upcoming flagship smartphone from the house of LG. And finally the wait is over as LG unveiled the G6 at the Mobile World Congress which is held at Barcelona in Spain. check out best dash cam. There hasn’t been any surprise on behalf of LG as they announced the arrival of the latest flagship device. In fact, most of the things that are revealed were predicted by many of the popular sources. And here we are with all the information that we have got from the official launch of the device at the MWC with all the pros and cons that will come your way if you wanna get hold of the smartphone in near future. this is the perfect gift for your girlfriend .. LG over the years has put some real focus on the design of the smartphones and that can be noticed in the smartphones which have hit the market in the recent times. And with the launch of the LG G6 things are expected to get much better. At least the first looks of the smartphone has revealed that. It has been revealed in the launch of the latest flagship device from LG that the smartphone is going to be built out of metal as well as glass. This is certainly going to be the striking feature of the LG G6 because the earlier smartphones like the LG G5 do not have either metal or glass as the building material.. Along with this new build of the smartphone, there are also a few things that have been added. Among the latest additions in the design of the smartphone we have the Corning Gorilla Glass 5 back panel. This is something that will make the smartphone much more durable than its predecessors. The smartphone weighs around 163 gm and has a dimension of 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm (5.86 x 2.83 x 0.31 inch). And by the overall looks of it, LG G6 is believed to be one of the best among the ones that are going to come out throughout the year.. Talking about the colours of the smartphone, it will be available on the market in three variants – titan (silver), black and white.. Smartphone developers have been putting in some real thoughts in relation to the developments in the display of a smartphone. And LG G6 could well be the first smartphones among the ones which are going to have some incredible features simply on the basis of the display of the smartphone. In fact, the smartphone has been launched with the words that it is going to be one of the first of its kind as it sports the Dolby Vision. It also has a support for the HDR10 technology. There are already a number of movies that have released in Dolby Vision so this feature is definitely going to make things look good for the LG G6 which has been fairly moderate on other fronts ( we can download Movie box App and watch all movies). Also, the upgrade to 18:9 ratio in the display is something that the fans need to have a look at as this provides the viewer with a much wider space than the ones which do not come with the 18:9 aspect ratio.. The display of the smartphone comes with a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 covering which is fairly protective enough. However, this is something that fans would love to see going through an upgrade as even the LG V20 comes with a Corning Gorilla Glass 4 covering. This is going to disappoint the fans a bit but the other features of the display are definitely going to come in as a cover up for this. The 5.7-inch IPS LCD Capacitive screen of LG G6 will have a support for a 1440 x 2880 pixels resolution with 564 ppi. Also, the South Korea-based smartphone developer is going to give up the concept of modular design of its predecessors.. This is something that is going to leave the fans of LG a bit disappointed. But that is definitely something all the fans have been aware of. Most of the prior news and updates that have come regarding the probable features of the LG G6 have revealed that LG G6 will sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor under the hood. And quite expectedly LG has announced that the smartphone will come with Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 under the hood. One of the reasons behind LG G6 not coming with the latest chipset under the hood is the fact that Qualcomm has been in a deal with Samsung which has prevented other smartphone developers to unveil smartphones with SD 835 processor before April. LG G5 came with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, so evidently there is a slight upgrade if we compare LG G6 with its immediate predecessor.. It has been announced that LG G6 will come with Adreno 530 GPU under the hood. The smartphone will run on an Android 7.0 Nougat operating system which is an expected upgrade from the Android 6.0 Marshmallow in the LG G5.. The LG G6 will come out a 4 GB RAM. And that has been basic standard for all the high-end smartphones. Other smartphones which have come out from LG, like the LG V20, also have a 4 GB RAM. The smartphone comes with an internal storage of 32 GB. It is expandable to quite a bit with the help of the mIcroSD card. At the launch of the device, it has been announced that the storage of the smartphone can be expanded up to 256 GB. The single SIM model comes with a dedicated microSD card slot. But the dual-SIM model will use the second SIM slot as the one for the microSD card.. The camera of LG G6 is certainly going to be the striking feature of the latest flagship device from LG. The dual-camera setup is something that LG G6 is going to retain. Both the lenses are going to be of 13 megapixels. But what is going to be the most exciting feature of the camera is the wide-angle lens. The rear camera is going to have a 125-degree wide angle camera. This is surely something that the consumers will look forward while going for the smartphone. Besides this there will be the additional enhancers which are quite popular among cameras of the high-end smartphones from huge number of developers that we have from different parts of the world.. The front camera is one of the most important things that have gained popularity over the last few years thanks to the rise of the idea of video calls and chats. And LG G6 is going to have a great front camera courtesy to the wide angle lens which is also the highlighting feature of the front camera. The front camera will be of 5 megapixels and will be assisted by a 100-degree wide angle lens.. One of the most important aspects of a smartphone is the battery backup. This is because users always look for a smartphone with a substantial backup. And the developers have done really well in packing the latest flagship device with a 3,300 mAh battery. It is a Li-ion battery and is going to be a non-removable one. The smartphone is also backed-up by the Quickcharge 3.0 technology which enhances the charging procedure of the smartphone.. The most striking feature of the LG G6 will surely be the Google Assistant. This smartphone is going to be the first smartphone in the market other than Google Pixel to sport Google Assistant. This is bound to be one of the most eye-catching feature of the smartphone and the sales of the smartphone is definitely going to be enhanced by a huge amount.. The additional features of a smartphone often turn out to be the deciding factor behind the credibility of a smartphone. And it seems that LG has taken some good measures in ramping up the additional features of the smartphone. There are a number of things that one might take a look at considering the fact that LG G6 is also the flagship device of the South Korea-based smartphone developer.. The first and foremost thing we need to take a look at is the resistance of the smartphone from foreign particles. And it can be said undoubtedly that LG G6 has taken some giant leaps in order to ensure the safety of the smartphone from water and dust particles. The LG G6 comes with an IP68 certification which is definitely one of the biggest upgrades from its immediate predecessor LG G5. In fact, it is safer than the LG V20 as well. This is because LG V20 comes with a MIL-STD-810G certification which makes the smartphone shock resistant. But in the bid to become the one of the biggest hits of the year, LG G6 needs the IP68 certification and the developers have done a really great job in order to incorporate this very much popular feature in the lately launched handset.. The fingerprint scanner will be placed at the back of the smartphone. This is also in line with the trend that LG has set for themselves. Most of the smartphones from LG sport the fingerprint scanner at the back. So the fingerprint scanner being placed at the back of the device is nothing new and all the LG fans are quite habituated with it.. Coming to the audio features of the smartphone, it can be stated that LG G6 could well be one of the prime smartphones of the year 2017. The smartphone comes with the Active noise cancellation with dedicated mic. Also, LG has stayed away from the current trend which has seen the developers giving up the 3.5 mm headphone jack and the 3.5 mm jack is there in the LG G6.. LG G6 will also sport the heat-pipes which will take care of the heat generated by the usage of the smartphone for long hours. And this has been one of the features of the smartphone that various news and updates have reported earlier. And the fans would be really excited to see that the rumour has turned true in the end. Along with this, the latest flagship from the South Korea-based smartphone developer will have Bluetooth v4.2 as one of the connectivity features. It will also feature Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and USB Type-C 2.0 as the connectivity options in the smartphone.. Like we already said, LG had unveiled its present flagship LG G5 in the Mobile World Conference (MWC) 2016 in Barcelona earlier this year and launched it in April. The previous flagship, LG G4 also followed the same pattern and was landed in April. The next flagship LG G6 will be unveiled at the MWC 2017 which is going to kick off from 27th February and will end on 2nd March. Our guess is, LG will launch the G6 1 day prior to this event i.e. 2017, just like they unveiled G5, last year. The LG G6 will hit the market shelves by the second week of March, 2017. LG has always taken care of their fan-base, has always kept parity between the upcoming flagship and the current one, so that it remains affordable.The LG G6 will be first launched in South Korea along with North America and Europe. Although the price of the LG phones varies from region to region, a spokesperson of the company hinted that the LG G6 might be priced between $500 and $600.. It is expected that LG is going to experience a revival with the launch of the LG G6. And the chances are high that the expectations are going to come true in near future. The price of the smartphone is yet to be revealed and it is supposed that we are going to get the confirmation regarding the price very soon. Also, what remains to be seen is the performance of the smartphone when it hits the retail shops. But one thing is for sure, if we take a look at the features and pit it against the features of the other smartphones from the house LG, this lately launched LG G6 has promised a lot and the fans would love to see the promise made gets materialized in the near future. we make a list of LG G6 case for your brand new smartphone.. 3 Best Wireless Doorbells of 2017 to Ensure Complete Protection of Your Home.

LG G6 review: Finally back in the race. At last, an LG flagship that's (mostly) worth owning.. Let's be real: Last year's G5 was ambitious, but it never lived up to its potential. Even now I have to give props to LG: It took guts to make that phone, and it took guts to admit at a Mobile World Congress press conference that it was a step in the wrong direction. "We get it," the company seemed to say. "We were wrong, but we listened and did better.". And you know what? It did. The props I offer to LG now are not only for moxie but also for surprisingly good execution. Apart from adding a surprisingly long screen, the company gave up on trying to redefine how smartphones work and built a more conservative machine that played to people's desires instead. It's a more sensible kind of flagship for LG. Too bad the competition this year is fiercer than ever.. Dual camera offers lots of flexibility. LG’s interface still isn’t for everyone. After LG went wild with the G5, this year’s flagship G6 can’t help but seem a little subdued by comparison. That’s alright, though: It’s full of notable improvements, from the water-resistant body to the beautiful, extra-long screen. Plus, the dual-camera setup feels a lot more polished. And, despite packing one of last year’s Snapdragon 821 chipsets, the G6 plenty fast for most. There are some shortcomings though, like mildly concerning battery life and an interface that’ll still feel too heavy for some. Still, the G6 is easily the best smartphone LG has put together in a long time.. I wouldn't be surprised if LG took almost everything it learned about industrial design with the G5 and set it on fire. That's the sort of seismic shift we're working with here. And honestly, it's for the best. The G5's modularity required sacrifices, and with that constraint gone the company's engineers were able to design a sleek, sturdy frame that feels worthy of a flagship. You can tell just looking at the materials used. The G5's light, plasticky metal is gone, replaced by Gorilla Glass 5 on the G6's back (a pane of Gorilla Glass 3 covers the screen). Those glass panels eventually meet at a band of aluminum that encircles the phone. Even better, the G6 is IP68 dust- and water-resistant, a feat that was straight-up impossible last year because of the G5's slide-out battery mechanism.. Gallery: LG G6 Review | 17 Photos. One of the few design decisions that remained was the dual camera on the back, only this time it sits flush with the phone's body. Below that is the signature sleep/wake button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor. It's been years since LG made this a mainstay of its high-end phones, and I appreciate the placement. The sensor was always within reach of my index fingers, but it occasionally needed a few clicks to unlock.. Meanwhile, you'll find the volume keys on the left side, directly opposite the microSIM and microSD card slot (which takes up to 2TB of additional storage). You'll probably need the latter too. In the US, the G6 comes with 32GB of storage, only 19GB of which are available once you crack open the box. There's a USB-C port on the bottom, a headphone jack up top and that's really it. Well, except for the G6's claim to fame: the display.. I challenge you to tear your eyes away from the G6's screen, its rounded corners or the mere sliver of bezel running around it all. The phone is basically all screen, and it feels like a revelation. In fact, with a screen this prominent, the rest of the G6's frame fades into the background (especially on our low-key black review unit). That's fine by me; the G6 is a well-built machine, but it's pretty plain-looking.. LG's minimal design aside, the company squeezed a whole lot of screen into a modestly sized body. It's remarkably comfortable to hold and use for long periods of time. Between the not-quite-finished model I received at Mobile World Congress and the consumer-ready, AT&T version LG later provided, I've been using this all-screen design for over a month. In a nutshell: I'm never going back. You'll still shimmy your hand up the phone's body to reach the top corners with your thumbs, but the G6 is surprisingly comfortable for one-handed use.. To top it all off, it's surprisingly durable. One night, while perhaps a little tipsy at dinner, the G6 slipped from my grasp and fell about 15 feet from the restaurant's upstairs table to the hard tile of the ground floor. I felt like a tremendous idiot, but the phone suffered only a few nicks around the edges. Since the screen is the single biggest change to LG's G Series formula, let's dig a little deeper. It's a 5.7-inch IPS LCD running at 2,880 x 1,440 (that's an 18:9 aspect ratio, for those keeping track). As far as LG is concerned, this super long FullVision display is the way of the future. After all, it seems well suited to multitasking, and filmmakers (like La La Land's Damien Chazelle) have already embraced wider-than-widescreen formats. Even better, the G6 and its screen support standards like Dolby Vision and HDR10 for more-vivid video. It's just too bad that finding content that takes full advantage of this screen is still pretty difficult.. And don't forget about those curves. The corners of the panel are actually round, which supposedly helps disperse the blunt force that comes with a careless drop. It's equal parts clever and cool-looking, which I love. None of this would matter if the screen itself was lousy, but that's thankfully not the case: Text and images are crisp and precise, colors are lively without veering into over-saturation. Viewing angles are excellent too, which is crucial: What good is a long screen if it's hard to glance at?. So yeah, LG clearly paid a lot of attention to the G6's display -- too bad it didn't spend as much time on the phone's audio. There's a single speaker wedged into the phone's bottom, and its output is anemic at best. It's a good thing LG kept the classic headphone jack around, but even that isn't as good as it could be. See, despite the company's commitment to high-quality audio with its V Series phones, the G6 lacks the Quad DAC that made devices like the V20 such great media players. I guess I shouldn't be that surprised: You had to buy a separate "Friend" to squeeze high-fidelity audio out of the G5, and it was never available in North America anyway. There's still hope for you audiophiles: The Asian version of the phone has that DAC built in if you don't mind scouting for foreign devices online.. Remember the days when LG's custom interface was terrible? Yeah, so do I. These days LG is into restraint, and while it's still a long way from stock Android 7.0, the company's skin and apps add more value than headaches. Does that mean it's for everyone? Hell no, but it's progress.. That progress can be tougher to spot if you've used the G5 or the V20, since almost all the usual tricks are back. You can still turn on the screen with a double-tap, rearrange your navigation keys or ditch the traditional Android app launcher in favor of an iOS-style app free-for-all. The most noticeable changes are cosmetic -- here's looking at you, wallpapers and "squircle" icons -- but the biggest ones are meant to take advantage of that super long screen.. Consider the calendar and the contacts list: They look normal enough when launched, but rotating the phone reveals another view that displays extra information in two side-by-side square panels. Still another included app lets you change how other apps are scaled to fit on-screen. Fiddling around with it can get certain apps looking more natural on the G6's 18:9 display, but in my experience, you could ignore this feature completely and not miss out on anything. Google's also got your back: It's been encouraging developers to build native support for 18:9 screens into its apps.. Speaking of Google, the G6 was -- briefly -- the only non-Pixel smartphone to come with Google's virtual Assistant. Google kind of spoiled LG's fun by rolling Assistant out to compatible devices shortly after the G6's announcement , but hey, a good voice interface is a good voice interface. If you were expecting differences in performance between the Assistant here and the one running on Google's first-party hardware, don't worry. After a few initial moments of sluggishness, talking to the G6 was as pleasant as talking to the Pixels. That's good news for those of you with burning curiosities and a fondness for chatting with inanimate objects.. The AT&T model we tested is loaded with bloatware. Maybe the strangest change is AT&T's use of Firefox -- not Chrome -- as the default web browser. Some of you won't mind, as Firefox is a perfectly good alternative. Beyond that, we're left with 13 preloaded apps no one ever actually asked for and a persistent notification that keeps insisting I set up the DirecTV remote app. News flash, AT&T: I don't use the service and wouldn't use this app even if I did, so for the love of God, stop shoving this notification in my face.. Dual cameras have gone from gimmick to flagship feature, and LG was one of the first companies to make them feel valuable. The work began with last year's G5, which combined an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with a 16-megapixel main camera for more-flexible shooting. It was a solid first attempt, but this year's approach feels much more elegant.. For one, this time the normal and wide-angle cameras shoot at the same 13-megapixel resolution. Now we have resolution parity, and they both turn out crisp, detailed images without much fiddling. There are still differences between the two though. The main camera has a f/1.8 aperture, optical image stabilization and phase-detection autofocus, all of which the wide-angle camera lacks. In other words, you should probably steer clear of those wide-angle shots at night: They too often come out fuzzy and improperly exposed.. Gallery: LG G6 camera samples | 35 Photos.

In normal daylight conditions though, both cameras capture crisp images with lots of detail and bright colors. In fact, thanks to some aggressive image processing, colors can sometimes border on garish. For more-nuanced control over your photos, you can switch into a Pro mode with manual settings. It's overkill for most, but in the right hands it leads to some killer shots. And fortunately, switching between the two cameras is mostly free of lag, a feat the company pulled off with some help from Qualcomm.. LG also threw in some square shooting modes that make use of the long screen. You can, for instance, instantly preview photos you took on one side of the screen while retaining a live view on the other or quickly build an animated, 4x4 grid of shots for Instagram or whatever. It's debatable how valuable some of these modes are, but I'm willing to admit I might be short on imagination.. The G6 also doubles as a respectable videographer's tool. It packs full manual control, a first for LG, which also helps keep low-light videos looking good. What's more, handy additional features like focus peaking and hi-res audio recording are must-haves for people who take their on-the-go shooting seriously. I still think Google's Pixels are the best all-around smartphone cameras out there, but consider me impressed by the sheer flexibility on offer here.. The G6 felt plenty fast in day-to-day use, thanks to the Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM and the Adreno 530 GPU ticking away inside. I know what you're thinking: This is a very familiar configuration that we've already seen in a handful of flagship phones. The Galaxy S8 and Sony's Xperia XZ Premium might churn out more power thanks to their shiny new Snapdragon 835s, but performance rarely felt lacking.. My usual workday consists of a lot of Slack, Outlook and Spotify, with pretty frequent sessions of Hearthstone and Dirt Extreme. Multitasking -- even in split-screen mode -- yielded relatively few hiccups. And graphically intense gaming proved to be no problem either. Swiping around the interface and launching apps was snappy too, though spurts of slowness popped up from time to time. I'd put my money on LG's interface dragging the system down, but it was never enough to cause more than momentary frustration.. Unfortunately, I haven't had the greatest luck with the G6's battery. It's a 3,300mAh cell, which is larger than what you'll find in some competitors -- the HTC U Ultra and the regular Galaxy S8 spring to mind. Even so, I could only count on the G6 to last for one day. If I was lucky and didn't use the phone too much, I might wake up the next morning to find it still clinging to life. The G6 didn't fare much better in our video rundown test, where we loop HD videos with WiFi connected until it dies. It lasted just under 11 hours, which puts it a bit behind last year's V20.. To put that in perspective, the G6 did worse than HTC's U Ultra and the smaller Google Pixel, despite both of them having smaller batteries. At least the G6 is convenient and quick to charge: It supports Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0 tech, and the US model comes with built-in wireless charging support. (In case you've been keeping track, that's /another/ thing the G5 couldn't do.). I don't mean to spoil the ending, but this is the best phone LG has built in years. The problem is, its biggest rivals haven't exactly been sitting still. After a wave of strong first impressions, Samsung's Galaxy S8 is clearly the smartphone to beat: It too has a long, bezel-less display, and it's clearly more of a looker. Beyond that, I'm cautiously optimistic about what the S8's Bixby virtual assistant will develop into over time. The G6 could have the edge in photography though. I'm told the S8's camera aren't hugely improved over last year's S7s, and that's a hell of a niche to leave open for LG.. If you're looking for a better music experience, you might want to check out the LG V20 ($599) as well. It packs the Quad DAC that our version of the G6 doesn't have, and it has a small, sometimes useful second screen above the big one. And for those of you looking for the peak of what the Snapdragon 821 can offer, I'd suggest Google's Pixel XL ($769+). I already mentioned it had the best all-around smartphone camera out there; it also packs a completely clean version of Android. Sure, it might not be as attractive as the G6, but its sturdy build quality means it feels every bit as premium and it'll get software updates from Google as soon as they're available.. It's also worth pointing out that buying a G6 can be lucrative in other ways. If you were fast enough on the draw, you could've nabbed a free TV and/or Google Home to go with that G6. That's an uncannily good deal, though it feels a little desperate.. There's no doubt about it: The G6 represents some of LG's best smartphone work ever. Sure, it's not perfect: Audio is pretty weak, and so is the battery. None of that takes away from the fact that LG has built a phone that feels ready to compete with the best of the best for the first time in ages. Whether it has what it takes to beat those rivals, though, is a matter of opinion.. I've enjoyed my time with the G6 but you can't underestimate the power of a visceral thrill, and that's one thing the G6 never managed to deliver. Deep down, I can't help but wonder if this year will go LG's way. The Galaxy S8 and Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone are poised to suck the air out of the room, and it'd be a shame to see LG's effort overshadowed simply because other companies are better at generating hype. If you're looking for a shiny new smartphone, the G6 definitely deserves a close look ... but you might want to wait until we see what the full field of competitors looks like.. android , g6 , gear , lg , mobile , review , smartphone.

It allows you to choose your phone first and your carrier second. Upon selecting a plan, simply insert the carrier's SIM card into the phone and you're ready to go. If you decide you want to change carriers down the road or want to take an international trip, it's as simple as replacing your existing SIM card with a new SIM and activating your new plan.. What are the benefits of an unlocked phone?. Freedom: Choose the carrier with the best service or price. If you find a better deal later, you have the ability to change to a different carrier.. Travel: Take your phone internationally and use the carrier of your choice. It's as easy as inserting an active SIM card.. Selection: Choose the phone with the features you want, whether or not your carrier sells it, and get more service options without a contract.. How do I set up my unlocked phone?. The first thing you’ll need is a SIM card for your desired carrier. When activated, the SIM card will let your phone connect to your carrier’s network. If you decide to upgrade to a newer unlocked phone in the future, you can easily remove the SIM card from your old phone and put it in your new phone—just make sure you get the right size of SIM card (nano, micro, or standard) for your phone. If you want to use your phone while traveling internationally, you can easily buy a SIM card for a carrier that operates where you’re traveling. As long as it’s activated, you can just swap SIM cards when you arrive at your destination.. 2.83 x 0.31 x 5.86 in. 2.83 x 0.31 x 5.86 in. 2.73 x 0.32 x 5.61 in. 3.07 x 0.33 x 6.09 in. 2.98 x 6.06 x 0.31 in. 0.31 x 5.84 x 2.89 in.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars P.I.T.A. TO ACTIVATE ON VERIZON BUT IT WORKS. Offer Type: Prime Exclusive - With Offers & Ads | Verified Purchase. Unlike the below poster I WAS able to activate this on Verizon. I had to purchase a new SIM card because my previous phone used a micro SIM (different form factor), and wouldn't work. Basically the support person had me remove the SIM I had just purchased, put it into another Verizon phone that was already activated, and then he activated the new SIM while it was in the temporary donor phone. This worked and now I can use the phone normally. Initially he said the phones IMEI wasn't detected, but after doing this it was. The only issue so far is that on the VZW website it doesn't have a picture of the phone or description, just the phone # /imei / etc Now onto the phone itself. It is basically the same as a G6 but with the quad DAC and 128GB of storage. I purchased the 'amazon' version and it has a persistent ad on the lockscreen, but honestly I don't find it very intrusive and IMO is worth the 200$ savings. You can remove some of the preinstalled apps with ADB commands but the amazon apps that serve ads are installed in /system/priv-apps/ which can't be modified unless you root the phone. Speaking of rooting, this model of G6 can be unlocked through official means from LG (although that voids your warranty) This is probably the best deal for a phone with flagship specs without the flagship price on the market right now and can trade blows with phones that cost literally twice as much. IP68, HEADPHONE JACK!, 128GB storage, wireless charging, dual camera, fingerprint reader, SD CARD SLOT!, USB type C. The only thing it's missing is a notification LED and a removable battery. I would highly recommend flossy carter's review on youtube if you don't know much about this phone - but to those worried about overly intrusive ads, I wouldn't worry about it unless you have another 200$ burning a hole in your pocket. Plus it's amazon so you can always just return the thing no questions asked My phone came with the LG headphones, but they are pretty crappy. I am awaiting a response from LG on the 2nd year promise warranty and will update when they respond, but this phone should be eligible for it as well.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Okay so far.... Offer Type: Prime Exclusive - With Offers & Ads | Verified Purchase. I was disappointed to see the sheer lack of pictures of the phone, and pictures taken by its camera. Had I, I might have gone a different route. not for certain.) I shopped around for 3-4 days, read "official" reviews for a half dozen phones, looked at specs, compared hardware, size, screen dpi, etc. I decided to grab this phone when I saw it on sale, with Amazon ads. No big deal, I had another with the ads and it was (mostly) minimally invasive. The 128GB built in storage was a huge bonus, as were the B&O headphones that this was SUPPOSED to come with (according to everything I read). I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile... but I'm definitely an audiohead and was looking forward to these. As such, another big selling point for this was the built-in 32-bit DAC. So far this has been my favorite part of the phone. Paired with my 1Mores the audio from this is stellar. Even the included semi-cheap LG earphones sound pretty good with the DAC switched on. (Why anyone would ever NOT turn it on is beyond me.) The speaker phone speaker isn't too bad. I've turned it up relatively loud with no distortion (I won't max it out because once you damage a speaker you damage it). This will be used minimally by me, however. Additionally the phone has NFC, which I don't use and can't foresee myself using at all in the near future. The phone does phone calls over WiFi when you're connected. This is a nice feature because this almost always means you end up with a good quality call. WiFi hot spot is nifty, though untested on this phone. It's a nice benefit, being able to take my work laptop anywhere I go and knowing I can VPN in at the drop of a dime when the need arises. And speaking of WiFi the phone absolutely screams speed wise while it's on WiFi. So far 4G LTE has been sub par when I've measured it but I'll try from a nice open space later. I tried to pair my Bluetooth with my car this morning and failed. The phone sat there at "Connecting" for about 45 seconds before I decided my patience had run out and I just drove to work. I'll try to pair it again on my lunch break and update this. (UPDATE: I was able to get this to pair. I had to completely disable the Bluetooth on both my phone and my car. I've never had to disable the Bluetooth on my car before, and I've paired more than half a dozen phones on it. At least it's working now.) The screen is beautiful and the amount of detail you get is, so far in my experiences, unparalleled. My last few phones have been standard 1080p so stepping up to this is a whole other level. (The color isn't overly saturated like Samsung tends to be.) I haven't tried the Dolby Vision much, but I can confirm that on Netflix at least it says it's enabled. The only downside is that text can be TINY! I'm an old fart of 38, I can't be expected to read that! Both the front and back cameras have normal and wide options. I haven't played with the camera TOO much but probably will over the holiday and following weekend, and I'll add pictures from that. The fingerprint scanner so far works pretty well. I usually do two finger profiles per finger that unlocks for added accuracy. I wish there was a nice easy way to unlock the phone when it's face down though. (UPDATE: I found that there actually is a way. Just double tap the screen while it's off. Brilliant!) There are a few LG pre-installed apps that I disabled, but also instagram and facebook came pre-loaded? What the heck? I'm an adult, not a child nor a millennial. When running YouTube the phone seems to bog down/lock up if you don't have a nice, steady data stream. I went to a video and while it was loading the phone was completely unusable. Then another time I couldn't do anything while a video was buffering. Hopefully it was a one off event since I hadn't run YouTube on the phone before. So far my only gripes so far are the lack of B&O earphones, and that every time I add a new app to the phone it puts the icon on a brand new page on the home screen. There are already four pages with a ton of room, I don't know why it's creating a fifth page. Stats: WHAT'S IN THE BOX!? G6 logo inlayed cleaning cloth Quick Charge charger USB to USB-C cable Cheap LG earphones (NOT B&Os! How disappointing.) Booklet manual Key... thing (to open the SIM/SD card port) Phone (at least this was as advertised) UPDATE (01/26/18) - After using the phone constantly for the last two months I still enjoy it. It's not without its short comings (particularly the picture quality in low light... but what phone can take perfect shots then?) but it's still going strong. I don't even worry about running out of space and I haven't even installed an SD card. The fingerprint reader is still lightyears beyond what moto uses, thank God. My biggest new complaint is "HD Calling". It is awful, regardless of whether you're on LTE or WiFi. The call breaks up like the old school cordless phones when you got too far from the base. I wasn't able to figure out how to turn on "HD" calling specifically, but I turned of VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling and I think that did the trick. Secondarily I have issues unlocking my phone while the alarm is going off. (Let's be real, who doesn't use their phone as their alarm clock?) And lastly, unlocking the phone when a call is coming in can be a pain in the neck. Sometimes when I unlock it I get just a blank screen. So I have to re-lock it, and lock it again. Neither of these will cause me to replace the phone immediately, but all of the above ensure I will look for a replacement at some point this year I'm certain..

Offer Type: Prime Exclusive - With Offers & Ads | Verified Purchase. No problem using it on T-Mobile senior plan, 2 lines for $60 unlimited everything. Comes with LG headphone, not the higher price B&O H3. LG has confusing model naming issue. Regular LG G6 has either 32GB or 64GB storage; G6+ has 128 GB storage plus a slot for micro SD card. I added a 64GB microSD to my phone. Key factors for going with this phone are: Amazon with-Ads discount of $200, the improved HiFi sound, and the durability tests.

Offer Type: Prime Exclusive - With Offers & Ads | Verified Purchase. I'm a LG fan, and this G6+ does not disappoint. I was happy to see that they had incorporated the water and dust resistance into this model. I am also impressed with the sound and video quality. The hi-fi earbuds are great too. The prime adds are no big deal at all and I was grateful for the savings. The additional year of warranty coverage being offered by LG at no cost makes me an even greater fan, if that's possible. Oh, and no problems activating on Straight Talk using Verizon towers, for those wondering.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. I've only had it a week.

I got this phone two days ago, and as advertised, the ads are not present anymore. It came with some bloatware, but they weren't like what the big carriers dump on you, as nothing... 5.0 out of 5 stars but they weren't like what the big carriers dump on you - UPDATED. Would not connect to the internet. I had to return it and buy from a phone store. It made the whole experience dreadful. 1.0 out of 5 stars Would not connect to the internet. Excellent phone with super camera and great sound!

Everything I would want from a top of the line smartphone. The screen is gorgeous, it fits the hand well, and it is lightning fast. 5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Deal for a top smartphone.
