Mobiles / Oppo Mobile Phones / Oppo A33 Price in India. User Visits: 39 Compare. Affordable selfie smartphone Beautification mode Color OS for easy user interface. The Chinese handset maker Oppo happens to be as big in stature as its Chinese counterpart, Xiaomi. Oppo is known for manufacturing world's first smartphone that came with a revolving camera, which served as both front and rear camera. Also, the handset maker has a number of revolutionary smartphones in its N and R series. Now, the brand has come up with new entry level smartphones with a new series called A series. The Oppo A33 is one of the first smartphones to be launched under this lineup of handsets and here is a brief overview of the device for the benefit of our readers.. This handset is an entry level mid range device from the Chinese brand and as such, does not come with a state of art design. It happens to have a simplistic bar form factor and polycarbonate make, which is quite standard. To elevate looks of the device, brand has opted for contrasting back/front panel and sides.. Oppo has equipped the new handset with a decent sized 5-inch display on the front that enhances the whole viewing experience of the device. However, the handset disappoints when it comes to the resolution as it is pegged only at 960 x 540 pixels.. The performance offered by the handset is quite commendable as Oppo has equipped the device with a Quad-core processor clocked at 1.2 GHz. The processor of the handset is also supported by 2 GB of RAM for a consistent commendable performance. Under the rear panel of the handset is a 2400 mAh battery, which lasts for a considerable duration on a single charge.. Oppo has equipped the new A33 smartphone with a powerful 8 MP camera on the rear panel that is ideal for routine photography. The front panel of the device houses a 5 Megapixels camera that will appeal to selfie lovers.. This handset is a dual-SIM device that comes with support for both 4G LTE and 3G connectivity for faster Internet browsing wherever you are. The device also has other features like Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct, microUSB, Bluetooth and GPS.. With Oppo A33, the Chinese handset maker has successfully marked its foray into the entry level mid range segment of Indian smartphone market. The handset boasts of all features that puts it at par with other handset in this price range and makes for an attractive value for money offering.. 13,990 (Expected Price) Oppo A33 is currently not available in any online store..

Download our Official Android App: Forums for Android!. Support Mobile is not showing call screen both on incoming & outgoing calls and even not ringing?. Discussion in ' Android Devices ' started by pranavindia , Feb 14, 2018 .. After rooting it was running smooth for few days. I have uninstalled few system apps (I don't remember which apps) but I haven't uninstalled any system app related to dialer. But phone is not showing call screen on calls and moreover, it is not ringing on incoming calls. Only thing I'm getting is a missed call notification after call. I even did a factory reset to phone but still the problem exists. Have you tried installing other dialers?. Though that another dialer app has its own caller screen but it is not showing up every time and phone is still not ringing.. Have you tried installing other dialers?. Quite frankly it does sound like you deleted something you shouldn't have in system, and you'll need to reflash the original firmware. As it's an Oppo, can you read Chinese?. Can I download latest Oppo update from Oppo website and install it as local update from settings? Will it fix the problem?. Quite frankly it does sound like you deleted something you shouldn't have in system, and you'll need to reflash the original firmware. As it's an Oppo, can you read Chinese?. Do you already have an account?.

Spesifikasi dan Harga Oppo A33 – Satu lagi produk perangkat pintar dikenalkan oleh Oppo kepada penggila gadget dunia. Produk smartphone terbaru dari Oppo kali ini adalah seri. Oppo A33 yang merupakan seri berikutnya dari keluarga Oppo A Series. Sebelum seri A33 ini, seperti kita tahu bahwa Oppo juga sudah merilis seri. Sama seperti Oppo A53, kali ini smartphone terbaru Oppo seri A33 juga ditempatkan pada segmentasi entry level. Meski menempati segmen pasar yang sama, namun. Oppo A33 jelas mengusung spesifikasi yang berbeda dengan Oppo A53. Nama Oppo sendiri dalam beberapa kesempatan memang seperti tenggelam di bawah agresifitas vendor lain asal Tiongkok yang semakin gencar menyerbu pasar gadget dunia. Sebagaimana kita tahu, para pesaing Oppo yang notabene juga berasal dari Tiongkok macam Lenovo, Huawei hingga Xiaomi menunjukkan gebrakan yang cukup masif lewat produk-produk terbaru mereka. Oppo A33 ini, terhitung hanya menelurkan tak kurang dari empat smartphone baru pada kuartal ketiga tahun 2015 ini. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa memang Oppo memiliki strategi pasar yang berbeda dengan para kompetitornya.. Sebagai pendatang baru, Oppo A33 sendiri dihadirkan dengan konsep fisik khas smartphone Oppo. Rencananya, ponsel pintar ini akan resmi diperkenalkan pada akhir bulan November ini. Meski secara spesifik hanya dibekali dengan komponen hardware yang kualitasnya di bawah seri Oppo A53, namun sobat Begawei jelas tak bisa meremehkan. Dihadirkan sebagai perangkat pintar kelas entry level, memang kualitas. Oppo A33 tak bisa disejajarkan dengan smartphone di tingkat premium. Namun demi menjaga pamornya di pangsa pasar smartphone dunia, Oppo pun membekali smartphone edisi terbarunya ini dengan spesifikasi yang bisa diandalkan. Oppo A33 ini dibekali dengan layar jenis IPS kapasitif berukuran 5 inci. Layar 5 inci ini merupakan salah satu layar terbesar untuk segmen smartphone kelas pemula. Tak hanya dibekali dengan layar yang luas saja, smartphone berbasis Android versi 5.1 ini juga didukung oleh komponen-komponen berkualitas di bagian ruang dapur pacunya. Oppo A33 ini dijamin maksimal berkat dukungan chipset MediaTek yang ditenagai oleh CPU Quad-core 1.2 GHz. Meski hanya merupakan komponen hardware kelas pemula, namun kinerjanya sudah cukup baik karena Oppo sendiri menyematkan RAM berkapasitas 1 GB sebagai pendukungnya. Oppo A33 pun juga didukung oleh sepasang kamera yang pastinya akan memberikan hasil jepretan foto berkualitas lewat duet kamera belakang 8 MP serta kamera depan 5 MP. Penggunaan jaringan data 4G LTE pada smartphone ini pun pastinya juga akan menambah kualitasnya. Nah, agar sobat Begawei mendapatkan gambaran lebih jelas mengenai produk smartphone terbaru dari Oppo ini, kami sudah menyiapkan ulasan lengkap mengenai spesifikasi dan harga. Oppo A33 pada segmen-segmen di bawah ini.. Perangkat Pintar Kelas Pemula dengan Desain Berkarakter Tegas.

Dari penampakan bagian fisik yang ditampilkan, spesifikasi Oppo A33 pada sisi eksterior kali ini membawakan desain berbentuk persegi panjang dengan garis sudut yang tegas. Ditambah lagi, baluran casing berwarna hitam dan putih membuat ponsel pintar yang satu ini tampil gagah dan memiliki kesan berani dengan pilihan warna netral. Oppo A33 sendiri juga membawakan bodi yang proporsional dan nyaman pada saat pengoperasian, yakni dimensi fisik berukuran 142.7 mm x 71.7 mm x 7,5 mm. Meskipun tidak seramping Oppo A53, namun untuk digenggam ponsel ini masih sangat nyaman karena memiliki Oppo A33 bobot yang lebih ringan, yaitu 145 gram.
