more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. posted by Ray S.. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction Samsung 's 2016 A-series is truly something. Retaining the slightly less-rounded rectangular shape of the 2015 A-series (compared to the flagship S-series), the new handsets have adopted a more gracious, sophisticated glass design. What's more, Samsung has added some additional size variations to choose from, the biggest of which being the Galaxy A9 – a 6" behemoth that impresses with both size and posture. At a price ranging from $450 to $500, the Galaxy A9 is easier to acquire than Samsung's top-shelf Galaxy S7 edge , yet most consumers will probably have a difficult time finding the spots where the corner-cutting has been done. If you happen to love large... no, HUGE screens, this may be the phablet you've always wanted. Design Some say, with a somewhat negative connotation, that metal has become the new plastic when it comes to phone design. If you happen to second this view, then I'd assume you are going to like the Galaxy A9, with its elegant glass exterior. Yes, it'll be easier to crack; yes, it'll attract more fingerprints, but it sure as hell looks and feels fancy! The design of the Samsung Galaxy A9 is among its main selling points: you can get it in three different colors: white, gold and 'pink gold', with the latter two having a black front. All three options are quite attractive. The metal side frame is colored appropriately for the three variations, and I'm pleased to say the company has excercised enough care so as to smooth out all the edges, making for a phone that feels genuinely good in the hand. 'Solid' and 'substantial' are two words I would definitely use to describe the Galaxy A9. The phone doesn't feel flimsy or plasticky like the Xiaomi Mi5 , for example, but nice and solid – it makes you feel confident that it's not going to fall apart easily. And then, having in mind the imposing dimensions and scale-tipping weight of 7.05 oz (200 g), the A9 sure is substantial enough – so much so that it easily outweighs other big and heavy handsets like the iPhone 6s Plus (6.77 oz | 192 g) and the Galaxy Note 5 (6.03 oz | 171 g). However, considering there's a massive, 6" display mounted on the Galaxy A9, such figures are definitely to be expected. Also worthy of note: as it's become the norm for recent higher-end Samsung handsets, the buttons (home, volume, power) are all clicky and easy to press, with a nicely defined tacticle feedback. The Galaxy A9, being a higher-tier handset , comes with a fingerprint scanner built into its home button, just like the S7 or Note 5. The scanner also works in a similar fashion: it's mostly quick and responsive, though its accuracy tends to go south the more careless the user becomes with their finger positioning. One feature the Galaxy A9 does lack, compared to Samsung's 2016 flagships, the S7 and S7 edge, is water-resistance. This is one area where we can say a corner has been cut in order to keep the price of the phone more accessible. Display The 6" panel is another centerpiece of the A9. If you're interested in this phone, you're obviously interested in gigantic displays. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy A9 with a decent, though not particularly fancy AMOLED panel. The 1080 x 1920 px resolution delivers a pixel density of 367 ppi, which is more than sufficient. There are the usual ultra-saturated screen modes like 'Adaptive' and 'AMOLED', but if it's reasonably balanced colors you're after, activating 'Basic' mode will engage a color profile that is more true-to-life. There is a slight tendency towards blue/green with this screen, and while this is mostly tolerable, colors happen to appear a bit subdued overall, especially at lower brightness levels. This is definitely not the liveliest display panel out there. Still, it's not really that bad, especially when we consider its lovely brightness levels: going up, it can reach 560 nits, which is enough to allow for comfortable outdoor viewing, while when we turn the lights off and hit the sheets, its minimum brightness of 1 nit will make sure that our eyes aren't irritated in any way while viewing it.. 6.37 x 3.19 x 0.29 inches. 161.7 x 80.9 x 7.4 mm. 6.22 x 3.02 x 0.23 inches. 158 x 76.8 x 5.9 mm. 5.96 x 2.92 x 0.29 inches. 151.5 x 74.1 x 7.3 mm. 6.03 x 3 x 0.3 inches. 153.2 x 76.1 x 7.6 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Samsung Galaxy A9 (2016) Compare.

I don't understand why an opinion such as "very, very big" should be listed as a con... ...on the other hand "massive screen" is listed in the pros..

(Posts: 977; Member since: 07 May 2015). posted on 12 May 2016, 08:39. This phone is roughly 1/8" taller and wider than the iPhone 6S Plus. None of that terminology was used when describing the 6S Plus in its review. (Posts: 474; Member since: 10 Mar 2010). posted on 12 May 2016, 13:49. You can check my comment below. And please stop wishing PA is better than this. I stop doing this from 2012 :)). (Posts: 14967; Member since: 25 Sep 2013). posted on 12 May 2016, 22:04. No they aren't better than this. We have a glimpse of the Note 6. You know these guys are bigots and hypocrites. As much as the iPhone 4/4s were fingerprint magnets, it was never said. As big and oversized the 6/6s Plus' are, this wasn't considered a con as you stated. (Posts: 2315; Member since: 14 Aug 2014). posted on 12 May 2016, 09:44. A scores I can tolerate with. (Posts: 474; Member since: 10 Mar 2010). posted on 12 May 2016, 13:47. This show the subjective opinion from PA. Just see how they tell the Iphone have a sleek design with small bezels =DD. I never understand why this could be a pros or a cons. However, the phone with same 5.5 inches screen as the others but employs the biggest chassis is 100% the cons (and they don't mention it). Yes, I mean the fruit bigger phone =DDD.. (Posts: 128; Member since: 27 Feb 2016). posted on 12 May 2016, 06:58. - Screen colors could be more natural. - TouchWiz needs to be more fluid. Swipping your finger on the home screen doesn't do anything IF that was what you were doing. The thing has 3GB of RAM. - Comes with Android 5.1, and not 6. But is the security patch up to date and is the OS stable?. (Posts: 2066; Member since: 23 Jan 2014). posted on 12 May 2016, 08:35. They review the accuracy in a mode that isn't designed for accuracy...... Which speaks levels about their bias. (Posts: 6598; Member since: 17 Feb 2016). posted on 12 May 2016, 09:31. Dude Android Marshmallow came out last October. No phone should be shipping with Lollipop at this point, regardless of security patches. If this was anyone but Samsung, everyone here would be on thier ass for taking so long to get 6.0 software on their devices.. (Posts: 686; Member since: 25 Jan 2009). posted on 12 May 2016, 10:00. I accept all your comment back except last one. Come on! No phone shall shipped with Android 5.1 now. it is time move over to Android 6. posted on 12 May 2016, 13:45. AMOLED has no relation with accuracy. S6, note 5 and s7 have more accurate screens than almost all the displays.. (Posts: 195; Member since: 18 Jul 2014). posted on 12 May 2016, 06:59. is the size a pro or a con for you?. IMO it shouldn't be mentioned as either. the size of the device is what the manufacturer intended it to be based on the targeted audience. it isn't a criterion upon which a device rating should be given!.

I have this phone and I think it's pretty awesome. A love larger screen phones because I have bigger hands so it's a good fit. I took this device on a trip to Ireland and it performed quite well. I used it all day taking photos, posting them to social media, searching for restaurants and attractions on Google and the battery took it all like a champ. Ending each night around 2/3am with 35-40% battery. Biggest gripe is the OK camera, but it can be amazing with HDR, steady hand, and patience.

I don't see any deep cons at all for this to be given a 7.5. (Posts: 3487; Member since: 26 Oct 2012). posted on 12 May 2016, 08:08. The biggest con is, its not an iPhone.. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 12 May 2016, 08:45. give low score on good phone. lots of people come to complaint in comment section. fanboy wars mean more traffic to this page.

Nice battery life, large average phone overall with a poor camera. Not sure the score is deserved, 6.5 would have been my score for this.. (Posts: 286; Member since: 23 Apr 2016). posted on 12 May 2016, 08:19. 6.5? Camera is the only con. What other problems do you see?. posted on 12 May 2016, 11:40. It's an overpriced mid ranger, why should it score higher?. (Posts: 444; Member since: 30 Jul 2014). posted on 12 May 2016, 08:20. I wouldn't say the camera is poor, even GSMArena says it's close to Note 5 in daylight scenes. Also, it has good performance from the Snapdragon 652. I don't really trust real-life situations performed by reviewers; smoothness is subjective. posted on 12 May 2016, 11:40. 8 or above should be for high end devices or exceptional mid rangers, this is neither..

Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Optical image stabilization, Autofocus. Software Features: Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets. Shooting Modes: High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Octa-core, 1800 MHz, ARM Cortex-A72 and ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: Wireless screen share.

It also includes 32GB of internal storage capacity, expandable up to 256 GB storage via microSD, 16 MP rear camera and fingerprint scanner.. I was recently using my phone yesterday at 6pmIt was down to the last 5% charge. I plugged it in and could see the lightning (charging). I kept using my phone and it went down to 1%. I know phones dont charge well when you are using them but i needed to do something quick. I left it alone at 1%, but i guess it was a bit to late and it turned off. Normally it would show that its charging and the percent on the screen since it was already plugged in. I unplugged it and re-plugged it and nothing. I decided to leave it alone. This morning 7am i plugged it again left it for awhile and it was warm bit it still wouldnt turn on. I has only been 6 months that i had this phone. I want to say its the battery but i dont know. I have uses the phone until it reaches 1% and it has died but never this. UPDATE: I called Customer service yesterday and they tried to help me out but the phone still wouldn't turn on. They told me to go to Best Buy- Geek Squad since they are approved and certified. I told the person helping me about my problem and that I was told to go to them. She wasn't sure and asked her manager. He started saying that they didn't deal with phones only tablets but I repeated again about what customer service said. He hesitated a bit before asking someone else to help me.. ......So basically what they did is they forced charged it/ super charged it (I forgot exactly how they said it) the phone for a few minutes and it turned on. They said that the phone probably got stuck, frozen and didnt know how to respond.. BE PERSISTENT: That same day in the morning I had gone to another Best Buy (This was before calling customer service). I asked if they could look over my phone. I was told they only dealt with phones bought from the store and that they had to have warranty, insurance.. Fix Kits starting at $16.99. The geek squad was smart in doing a boost charge to the battery. What most people are unaware of is that most lithium ion batteries in phones and other devices actually have a protective circuit enclosed in the battery. This helps prevent damage to the battery due to overcharging, discharging, extreme temperatures, and other factors. If a battery discharges below a certain voltage it can trigger the protective circuit. When it is in this state the battery will read at 0volts with a multimeter. You can wake the battery by doing a boost charge. It's kind of like jumping a car battery. You are supplying the battery with a higher voltage for a short period of time. By doing this it wakens the battery from this sleep state and then you can use the original charger to finish charging the battery. A lot of people throw away perfectly good lithium ion batteries because they think they are dead when in reality they actually are not and just need boosted to get them to charge and function again. This is especially true for batteries that have sat for awhile unused. To help prolong the life of your batteries try to connect your phone to a charger when it's between 15-20% and let it charge to at least 90% if possible. I know this is not always possible but it will help extend the batteries lifetime by preventing from overcharging and discharging to often, which can affect the health of a battery. Extreme hot and cold temperatures can also affect the life of your battery.. Thanks for the explanation!!! I could have probably prevented this by buying the right wall charger from day 1. The adpater the phone came is different from the one I needed.... so smart me thought I'll just use the one from my tablet since its a samsung charger after all.. ---I was told the opposite of what you mentioned. I was told to use the phone and let it die on its own this prolong the battery life.. What you have mentioned about fully discharging the battery to prolong it's life was true for the older nickel type batteries but not for newer lithium ion batteries. I will provide some links if anyone is interested in learning more about batteries.. A lot of retailers do not do warranty work unless you purchase (or are given in the deal) a warranty agreement from them but there is always the manufacturer's warranty on the product. In most cases it is for 1 year (12 months) and as you have a new model phone you should still be covered. Verify this by checking the purchase receipt for the phone. If the phone is still within the warranty period consult the warranty information contained in the documentation that came with the phone as to what you have to do to make a claim for a manufacturer's warranty repair or replacement.. If you cannot find the documentation, go online and search for Samsung galaxy A9 (2016) warranty for your location.. I wasn't looking for warranty work. If there was any work to be done i knew i would pay out of my pocket. This phone is meant for Hong Kong and Macau. I live in California so the warranty does not apply, I knew this was a risk I was taking.. I just wanted a place I could take my phone and possibly have it sent in directly to the company. Personally I've seen the work done by some "cellphone repair shop" and it can be sloppy. They aren't all the same but I wanted an authorized place.. Elizabeth C will be eternally grateful..
