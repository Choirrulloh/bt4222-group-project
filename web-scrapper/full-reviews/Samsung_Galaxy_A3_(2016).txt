CNET también está disponible en español.. Like small screens? The 4.7-inch Samsung's new Galaxy A3 will be your cup of tea (hands-on). If you simply can't stand how big phones have become, the 2016 Samsung Galaxy A3 may be just the ticket.. by January 13, 2016 10:58 AM PST. What's under the hood? 4.7-inch screen with 1,280x720-pixel resolution 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor 1.5GB of RAM 16GB of internal storage 128GB microSD card slot for external storage 2,300mAh battery 13-megapixel camera 5-megapixel front-facing camera Android 5.1.1 5.3 by 2.57 by 0.29 inches (134.5 by 65.2 by 7.3mm) 4.66 ounces (132 grams). Editors' note: This hands-on first take shares some text with those of the new Samsung Galaxy A5 and A7 .. Samsung's Galaxy A range of smartphones is designed for a younger, trendier crowd who can't afford its higher end flagships, such as the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. Announced late last year, the updated 2016 versions of these phones sport metal bodies similar to the S6 Edge, with shared design cues such as rounded edges and shiny glass rears.. While the specs can't quite compare with the Edge, the new Galaxy A phones will pretty much knock your socks off in the looks department, and really only vary depending on the screen sizes of the phone. For the Galaxy A3, this 4.7-inch stunner packs a 13-megapixel rear camera, 4G LTE connectivity and runs the latest Android 5.1.1 operating system.. The phone first made its debut in China alongside the Galaxy A5 and A7 , and is set for global markets in the new few months. Alongside the other two phones, the A3 will also be sold in Southeast Asia. In Singapore, the A3 costs an affordable S$398, which converts to approximately $275, £190 and AU$395. Do check with your local retailer for exact pricing and availability.. Honestly, the Galaxy A3's good looks will serve it well with students who want something a little more fashion forward, while still not costing a bomb. Samsung is hoping this is the case, and I honestly think the good looks of the A3 will help it do well despite its somewhat lower-end specs.. Meet Samsung's updated Galaxy A smartphones (pictures). While the trend of larger screens for smartphones isn't stopping anything soon, the A3 takes a step backwards with its 4.7-inch display. Now, you might be thinking, isn't this the same size as the iPhone 6S ? And isn't the look of the phone rather familiar too? Well, you wouldn't be wrong with that train of thought, but specs-wise, the A3 is a little dimmer than Apple's leading light.. The 4.7-inch display is only in HD resolution -- that's 1,280x720 pixels -- and is hardly anything to shout about, while the phone also lacks a fingerprint scanner. It is, however, a nice comfortable size that's easy to hold and use with one hand.. Besides support for most 4G LTE networks globally (apart from the US), the A3 features hybrid dual SIM card slots that let you use one of them as a microSD card slot with support for up to 128GB of storage space.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. posted by Nick T.. Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android +. 4 Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction Being obsessed top tech brands’ flagship devices, we sometimes forget that not all people need a phone with a gigantic screen , the fastest processor, or the latest camera technologies. In reality, there are still folks who look for a simpler phone – one that just works, one that fits in any pocket, one that doesn’t cost a small fortune to own. The Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) aims to be one such phone, but how well does it match the description? Well, I used it for a week to find out! In the box: Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) Wall charger (5V, 1.55A) Micro USB cable SIM card ejector Wired stereo in-ear headset (Model EHS64AVFWE) Quick start guide and warranty information Design The new Galaxy A3 is very attractive, pleasant to use, and its size makes it ideal for single-handed operation. When I took the 2016-edition Samsung Galaxy A3 out of its box, I checked again to make sure I had received the right smartphone. I was expecting it to be a humble low-tier device , but it didn’t look like one. Pleasantly surprised, I found myself holding a phone akin to the company’s top-tier models – one built of glass, held together by a sturdy metal frame, with rounded corners and chamfered edges for a comfortable, reassuring feel when held. The easy-to-reach volume, power, and home buttons are great as well, responding with a satisfying click when pressed. And with a screen size of 4.7-inches, the new Galaxy A3 can be easily operated with a single hand – a trait fewer and fewer phones can brag with. Alas, the appealing design of the 2016-edition Galaxy A3 has its downsides. The handset’s flat, smooth glass body gives it the tendency to slip off of flat surfaces even at the slightest angle. And that’s actually a big deal – I’m not convinced that the phone’s otherwise beautiful glass front and back plates would withstand more than a few drops from a table’s edge. Display Sufficiently detailed and bright, the Galaxy A3’s Super AMOLED screen gets the job done. Color accuracy in Basic Mode is great overall. It doesn’t take a trained eye to notice that the Galaxy A3’s 4.7-inch display is special. Built on Super AMOLED technology, it draws attention from afar with its intense, saturated to the point of exaggeration colors. I’m guessing that many people would actually find this kind of color reproduction quite appealing, yet folks who value color accuracy (such as myself) have the freedom of switching from Adaptive Mode, which set as default, to Basic Mode. The latter option, found in the Display Settings menu, produces almost ideally faithful colors across the entire spectrum, as our measurements confirm. Colors aside, the phone’s screen delivers 720 by 1280 pixels of resolution (312 pixels per inch), meaning that graphics and text are sharp enough. I’ve seen much more detailed screens on phones of this tier, but even on the new Galaxy A3, I’ve almost never found image detail to be insufficient or text to be difficult to read. Before I proceed, I must say that the Galaxy A3 (2016) is perfectly usable outdoors. Its screen not only has a high brightness output of nearly 500 nits, but it also has an outdoor display mode that kicks in automatically and boosts readability even further. At night, the screen brightness goes down to 1 nit so it is easy on the eyes.. 5.3 x 2.57 x 0.29 inches. 134.5 x 65.2 x 7.3 mm. 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.3 inches. 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6 mm. 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.48 inches. 142 x 72.4 x 12.2 mm. 5.51 x 2.72 x 0.27 inches. 140 x 69 x 6.9 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The numbers below represent the amount of deviation in the respective property, observed when a display is viewed from a 45-degree angle as opposed to direct viewing.. Minimum brightness Lower is better. Contrast Lower is better. Color temperature Lower is better. Gamma Lower is better. Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) Compare.

Maybe, just maybe, it's time to re-evaluate the battery tests you guys run?. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 11 May 2016, 09:04. in this review they said heavy users should bring powerbank. while in iPhone SE review they write "If you're using the phone really heavily, with features such as GPS or 3G/4G video streaming, you shouldn't expect it to last more than a day.". while A3 have almost 2.5hours more battery benchmark than iSE, lol.

If there's not a good phone that comes out in the next month or 2 with a screen under 5" then I'm definitely buying this. (Posts: 2660; Member since: 22 Jul 2014). posted on 11 May 2016, 10:44. So a $300 midrange a3 is pitted against a $499 iphone se with iphone 6 internals and obliterate se on selfie cam, screen sharpness, storage expandability, battery life and battery charging time?

The Galaxy A3 is the entry model in Samsung’s mid-range A series, which comprises the Galaxy A3, A5 and A7. Samsung has given the Galaxy A3 a lot of love and attention in its 2016 update - but has it done enough? We review the Samsung Galaxy A3 2016. Also see: Samsung Galaxy 5 6 (2016) review. and 2015 Samsung Galaxy A3 review .. Also see: Best Phone Deals. Update January 2017: The Galaxy A3 2016 has now been upgraded for 2017 - read our. Earlier this week we reviewed Samsung’s Galaxy A5 for 2016 , and noted that Samsung had applied the new metal-and-glass design it gave its flagship S-series in 2015. The £50 price difference between the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy S6 makes it difficult to recommend the much-improved but still less feature-packed A5 over the S6, but the Samsung Galaxy A3 comes in £100 cheaper than that year-old handset. Is that enough to make it worthy of consideration as a cheaper Samsung phone?. Our Galaxy A3 2016 was supplied by Mobile Fun , which charges £269 for the black, white or gold European models (in case you’re buying outside Europe note that these have a regional lock ). That’s £30 more expensive than last year’s A3 , but Samsung has made many upgrades to justify the price. For starters, while the previous A3 was more than twice the price of Motorola’s Moto E it offered similar performance; the 2016 model is closer to the mid-range- rather than budget competition, and even beats the new Galaxy A5 on framerates (which is due to its lower-resolution screen).. Also see: Best phones 2016. Samsung has also improved the display, which is now larger and higher in resolution, and bumped up the rear camera spec to 13Mp. There’s still no fingerprint scanner, but the battery capacity has increased, the speaker has been moved from the back to the bottom, and microSD support has been nudged from 64- to 128GB.. The Galaxy A3 is still too expensive for what you get, though. At £269 its closest competitors today are the £279 Motorola Moto X Play and £299 Google Nexus 5X .. As its price drops (Samsung phones tend to rapidly drop in price) we will begin to see the Galaxy A3 compete with the now year-old £230 (RRP) Sony Xperia M4 Aqua and £199 OnePlus X. are nicely designed phones that are faster and come with full-HD screens.. The Galaxy A3 2016 is sold SIM-free by Mobile Fun ; check out our. to get the best overall price.. Also see: Samsung Galaxy A-series 2016 UK release date, price, features and specification .. The design is perhaps the key selling point of the 2016 Samsung Galaxy A3. In 2015 we marvelled at how Samsung had finally got it right with the Galaxy S6’s build, and that it at last looked like the premium phone the company sold it as. In 2016 Samsung has brought the same mirror-finish glass front- and rear design to its mid-range A series, with the A3 identical to the larger Galaxy A5, which is itself remarkably similar in design to the Galaxy S6 - the corners are slightly squarer, the phone a tad taller and the rear camera protrudes less obviously, but the Galaxy A-series now has a premium design worthy of Samsung’s flagship family at a mid-range price.. Also see: Best budget phones 2016. There’s a lot of glass on show here, which sadly can mean a lot of fingerprints, too. Samsung has taken steps to protect the new A3 from accidental damage with a layer of tough Gorilla Glass 4, plus a strong aluminium body. It feels sturdy and, more importantly, the new A3 is an awful lot easier on the eyes than the aluminium-bodied Galaxy A3 2015.. Whereas phones usually get slimmer and lighter with each new generation, the new Galaxy A3 is thicker and heavier than its predecessor, measuring 7.3mm against its 6.9mm and weighing 132g against its 110g. There’s a very good reason for this, though: Samsung has also increased the battery capacity from 19,000mAh to 2,300mAh for longer runtime with the new more powerful hardware. And anyway, we prefer a slightly weightier, more substantial-feeling smartphone, since this prevents it feeling toy-like in the hand. All that glass and the pancake-flat rear does mean it can be a little slippery, however.. One of the best things about the new Galaxy A3 is its display. At 4.7in (up from 4.5in) it’s the perfect size for balancing a usable screen area for watching movies and playing games, and offering a comfortable fit in the hand. The screen bezels are very small, with a thin black line bordering the display, and the 2.5D curved glass at the front offers a smooth, seamless feel. Plus there’s the fact it’s a very decent screen.. Also see: Best Samsung phones 2016: What is the difference between Galaxy Note, Galaxy S, Galaxy A and Galaxy J?. Samsung’s SuperAMOLED screen tech is our favourite of all phone displays, with vibrant, slightly oversaturated colours and excellent contrast. Although the new Galaxy A3’s screen is ‘just’ HD (1280x720 pixels) in resolution, its relatively small screen size means it has a sharp pixel density of 312ppi - not exactly quad- or Ultra-HD, but bordering on Apple’s Retina Display quality. Viewing angles are decent, the display is plenty bright, and it will gobble up less battery power than the likes of IPS by omitting a backlight.. One of the things for which we criticised the original A3 was its rear-mounted speaker, which was in danger of being muffled when the phone was placed down on a flat surface or held in the hand. And it looked weird, sitting to the right of the rear camera. Samsung still fits only a mono speaker, but it’s moved the positioning to the phone’s bottom edge, just to the right of the Micro-USB charging port and headphone jack. Also see: Best Android phones 2016. In use the Samsung Galaxy A3 2016 feels reasonably fluid, although things will likely start to slow down as you increasingly eat through the storage by downloading apps, music and games and make use of the built-in camera and video camera. The A3 is sold with 16GB of internal storage, but having updated all the preinstalled apps (see Software ) we had just 9.3GB spare for our files. As with its predecessor there’s a microSD slot, and it now accepts 128- rather than 64GB of additional storage, although you should note not all apps can be moved to SD .. Also see: How to add storage to Android. In our experience apps could take a second or two to open on first launch, and more so when you try to open several at once, but performance is noticeably improved over the original A3. This is thanks to Samsung swapping out the 1.2GHz Snapdragon 410 for a 1.5GHz Exynos 7578 processor. This is a quad-core chip based on the Cortex-A53, and is paired with the Mali T720 GPU and 1.5GB of RAM. If you move up the range to the Galaxy A5 you’ll get an octa-core A53 chip, but it’s not as necessary here with the lower-resolution, smaller screen.. We ran the Samsung Galaxy A3 2016 through our usual benchmarks and found general processing performance in excess of budget phones such as the Motorola Moto E it was previously in league with, but lower than similarly priced phones such as the Motorola Moto X Play, Sony Xperia M4 Aqua and OnePlus X. In comparison to its sibling, the Galaxy A5, it performed better on graphics (thanks to the lower-resolution screen), but fell behind on general performance.. Nevertheless, when compared to its predecessor the all-new Galaxy A3 gave a greatly improved showing in our benchmarks. In Geekbench 3 we recorded 2156 points multi-core against 1220 for the older A3. We also ran AnTuTu on the new phone, where it scored 35,269 points, only a little behind the 37,906 of the Galaxy A5.. In our GFXBench graphics tests the new Galaxy A3 managed 20fps in T-Rex and 8fps in Manhattan, whereas the older model was capable of just 13- and 6fps respectively. Here the Galaxy A3 also beat the Galaxy A5, which scored 14- and 5fps respectively. This will be fine for watching video and playing casual games.. We use the JetStream JavaScript test to measure web browsing performance and, again, the A3 came close to the A5 with 22.766 against 23.146 (a higher score is better in this test). You can compare the Galaxy A3’s performance to all the phones we’ve recently tested in our article What’s the fastest phone 2016?. Our final benchmark is the Geekbench 3 battery test, in which the Galaxy A3’s 2,300mAh battery gave a shorter (but still excellent) runtime of 7 hours 24 minutes than the 2,900mAh A5’s 11 hours 46 minutes, but it scored higher with 4709 points against its 4446. You’ll easily get a full working day from this phone - two at a push - but, unlike the A5, the A3 doesn’t support Samsung’s Adaptive Fast Charging tech. Neither is there any wireless charging tech, and the battery is non-removable. Also see: Best power banks 2016 .. In terms of connectivity and extras the new Galaxy A3 supports only the basics, but pleasingly with the inclusion of NFC which will soon be used for mobile payments in the UK. There’s single-band 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and GLONASS and 4G LTE. Unlike the A5, no fingerprint scanner is built into the home button, so it’s unsurprising to find that neither does it have the heart-rate scanner found in the Galaxy S6 and S7. (A dual-SIM variant of the Galaxy A3 2016 will also be available outside the UK.). Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices.

Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) review: triple-A battery. Samsung has removed the Mini variant from its S-class lineup. There will be no S6 Mini, instead, Samsung has offered up the A3 (2016) and A5 (2016). Both devices bear the familiar S6 design principles, but is the Galaxy A3 (2016) as convincing in practice as its spiritual predecessor, the Galaxy S5 Mini ? Find out in our Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) review.. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) release date and price. The Galaxy A3 (2016) sits in the middle of the 2016 Galaxy range,. between the expensive S devices and budget lineups.. The A series is touted as the successor to the S5 Mini, although. the A3 (2016) is closer in size to the. Galaxy Alpha (although it is cheaper and slower).. The Galaxy A3 is not yet available in the US, but its price in Europe equates to. A3’s asking price and considerably cheaper that the S5 Mini and Galaxy Alpha. Other phones in this price range include the. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) design and build quality. The similarities to the Galaxy S6 are undeniable. 2.5D glass lends the A3 (2016) a rounded feel. The side buttons and SIM cover are made of metal. The Galaxy A3 (left) also comes in white, like the A5 (right), gold and pink. The Galaxy A3 (2016) is an improvement on the A3 (2015) both inside and out. Its design is a feast for the eyes, with an aluminum frame and resistant Gorilla Glass 4. on the front and back, both strongly reminiscent of its big brother, the Galaxy S6.. The metal frame is susceptible to nicks and dings, but otherwise the build quality is very solid.. The metal frame suffered its first scratches early on during our multi-day test. While it can handle small accidents without serious damage, every knock seems to leave a mark.. The curved glass edges (2.5D glass) on the front and back transition very smoothly over into the frame. The lightweight 132 g, 4.7-inch housing is very comfortable to hold. that the Galaxy A3 (2016) is prone to sliding out of your grasp and onto the floor.. The volume rockers and power button are made of aluminum. They are placed a bit too high up the side of the phone for my taste; they're difficult to reach when you hold the phone in your right hand, supported by your pinkie.. The Galaxy A3 (2016) is available in black and white as well as gold and pink. You can find images of the different color options in the Samsung Shop.. The A3's display is almost flawless. The Galaxy A3 (2016)’s display has an excellent range of contrast, which provides rich colors. The brightness is widely adjustable, making the display suitable for use in any everyday situation, whether that's outside in the sun or reading in bed at night.. The A3 has a 4.71-inch (11.95 cm) wide Super AMOLED HD (1,280 x 720 pixels) display. Upon very close inspection, you can make out individual pixels, but not so much that. it affects the legibility of small fonts.. Samsung's Smart Manager provides optimization tools and the S Planner. App icon counters and Quick Settings make TouchWiz very convenient. Samsung has made cutbacks to the number of preloaded apps it puts on its phones. because it means the software is now very lean and fast, theoretically facilitating the delivery of faster updates and ensuring increased security against unauthorized access.. The device we evaluated was the German model, A310F, running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop (Build LMY47X). comprises a launcher, Samsung’s usual set of notification sounds and a theme engine, which allows a certain degree of customization.. The list of unremovable apps has become pleasingly short. In addition to the usual Google Apps, there are a number of Microsoft apps (Excel, OneDrive, OneNote, PowerPoint, Skype, Word) and the following Samsung Apps:. The TouchWiz user interface offers some advantages over Google's bare bones stock Android: the Quick Settings are easier to customize and small counters appear at the corner of the app icons when there are unread messages or notifications (a feature that will be familiar to iPhone users).. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy A3 (2016) with its own quad-core Exynos 7578 processor. It is clocked at 1.5 GHz and draws on 1.5 GB of RAM. When multitasking between Chrome, Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter, loading times quickly started to drop off.. In our benchmarks, the Galaxy A3 (2016) left a lot to be desired. In practice, app load times are occasionally noticeable, and from time to time an app will crash when you open it a second time.. Neither gamers nor the generally impatient are going to be thrilled with the Galaxy A3. In this price bracket, you’re probably better off with the OnePlus X, which, despite bearing older innards, works much faster.. The 16 GB of internal memory is quickly filled up once you’ve installed most of your essential apps too, but you’ll have enough space left over for about 3,000 photos. If you need more room, manufacturer-specified microSD cards up to 128 GB are supported.. There are microphones at the top and bottom of the Galaxy A3 (2016). You can use the equalizer to compensate for the speaker being a little heavy on the mids. The internal speaker offers solid sound quality, with clear mids ensuring you can hear voices in a call well. The supplied headset has a button for answer/end call or play/pause and a volume rocker. The in-ear speakers are supplied with one set of buds, which work well so long as they fit your ears.. Samsung also provides the Galaxy A3 (2016) with a software equalizer. The SoundAlive equalizer has additional optimizations called SoundAlive+ and a tube amp effect placed in the audio options to the side when you connect the headset.. Color reproduction and details come through well in strong lighting. Snapshots in poor lighting just don't turn out well. Quick snapshots only really work under very strong lighting and when taken with a steady hand. When indoors, the focus rarely works fast enough to achieve anythng but blurry photos.. It is possible to take sporadically beautiful shots with the A3, as long as you. have plenty of light and something to rest your arm on.. The main camera is 13 MP when used in 4:3 format or 10 MP in 16.9 format and has an F1.9 aperture. The front-facing camera is 5 MP and has a F1.9 aperture. A double tap of the physical home button triggers the camera quick launch.. When it comes to cameras, good alternatives in this price range would be the Moto G (2015) or even the LG G3. The latter is an aging high-end device and also features a replaceable battery.. The Galaxy A3 has remarkable battery life. The battery life is an outstanding strength of the Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016). You can get about two days of use out of it and it seems well equipped to deal well with heavy use. Integrated energy-saving features also afford you great control over which apps are disabled in standby mode.. With 13 hours of screen-on battery life, the Galaxy A3 is a genuine long-distance runner. Quick charge and wireless charging are, unfortunately, not on offer, but the battery can still be fully charged in under 90 minutes.. The battery is 2,300 mAh and cannot be swapped out. It is charged via a micro USB port and an appropriate USB cable and power supply are included.. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) technical specifications. 134.5 x 65.2 x 7.3 mm. 1280 x 720 pixels (312 ppi). The new Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) is not as big a disappointment as the old A3 (2015) but it’s not as impressive as the Galaxy S5 Mini was, either. The performance is not outstanding, but it is adequate for the price. Its shortcomings are, however, offset to a degree by its strong battery life. The storage space on offer is probably not enough for many users, but Samsung has been so kind as to include a microSD card slot, so this isn’t of such great concern.. The camera is not as convincing as that of. Since the S5 Mini was a hit off the back of its strong camera and replaceable battery, it would be a mistake to deem the A3 a worthy heir to that throne.. If you’re looking for a cheap smartphone that’s going to take great pictures, you should pick up the Moto G (2015). If you want something that’s going to perform better when it comes to games and multitasking, the OnePlus X is perhaps your best option.. In my opinion this phone is perfect. Without a solid day long battery, any phone is useless. I've had it for 2 months and it's a very solid phone and I feel safe knowing that my phone will have the power to last more than a full day without carrying chargers, battery packs etc... The price is irrelevant, the performance is very good and the camera is also excellent.. Not sure where to start BUT: I've gotten the phone when the carrier had it in Fr with a plan extension and I paid 27 euros. other carriers have it for free. I also have the "German" model and looking through the picture gallery I'm surprised...NONE of my pictures look that bad! The build is stunning and the only downside is one needs a case/skin on this puppy 'cause it's slippery as hell! need improvement? slap CM 13 and the performance goes up up up. not to mention it comes with an 8core proc!!! the other 4 are easy to unlock too. This is why a lot of people PREFER Samsung: the hardware is well put together and the developer support is insane! since links are not "ok" just search "a310f unlock cores" and click the first link.. I doubt CM13 can be installed If I understood correctly,the SD410 variant (US?) has the bootloader locked,and the european (well,at least the german one) uses an exynos CPU. So...samsung a3 2016 or a5 2015?. Samsung is one of the best brand in the world. However, the price of all its phone are all very expensive.. in this range mi phones are better thn it n they are near to flagship phones....yaaaa if u want brand thn go for this phones otherwise there are lot of options. Samsung has so much clutter in its line of phones. You can lose sight of their good stuff with all the crap they also produce..

Small dimensions (5.30 x 2.57 x 0.29 inches). Thin body, measuring less than 7.5mm/0.3inches (0.29 inches). Too little RAM memory (1.5 GB RAM). Low pixel density screen (312 ppi). The compact Galaxy A3 (2016) sports a 4.7" HD display (up from a 4.5" one), and runs on a quad-core SoC under the hood, clocked at 1.5 GHz, and paired with 1.5 GB of RAM. The camera is now 13 MP camera, compared to 8 MP in the first A3, while the 5MP snapper at the front stays the same. The battery pack has been given a boost here as well, though, to 2300 mAh from 1900 mAh.. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) Review Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) manual Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) benchmarks. Dimensions: 5.30 x 2.57 x 0.29 inches (134.5 x 65.2 x 7.3 mm). Weight: 4.66 oz (132 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Materials: Main body: Glass; Accents: Metal. Display Physical size: 4.7 inches. Resolution: 720 x 1280 pixels. Features: Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass 4), Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Self-timer, Geo tagging.

Page 1 of 2 Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) review: The S6 Mini in disguise 1. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) review: The S6 Mini in disguise 2. Battery Life, Display, Camera, Conclusion & Specifications. It's expensive, but the tiny Galaxy A3 2016 beats every other mid-range smartphone when it comes to looks and battery life. Processor : Quad-core 1.5GHz Exynos Octa 7580, Screen Size : 4.7in, Screen resolution : 1,280x720, Rear camera : 13 megapixels, Storage (free) : 16GB (11GB), Wireless data : 3G, 4G, Size : 135x65x7.3mm, Weight : 132g, Operating system : Android 5.1.1. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) is a budget smartphone with a premium look. With a metal frame, Samsung gave its customers the same high-end feel as its Galaxy S line, without them having to burn a hole in their pockets.. With such a beautiful design, the Galaxy A3 2016 could even be mistaken for a miniature Galaxy S6. to look at with its smooth glass rear, slim. bezels, that both combine with its thickness to produce a fantastic phone to hold.. Better still, since we reviewed it, it has dropped in price - dropping from £269 to under £200 , making it an even more appealing pruchase.. That beauty does come at a higher price this year, though, as its current SIM-free price of £269 is a long way from the initial £225 you had to pay for its plastic-backed forebear. In fact, it's even more expensive than the OnePlus 2 , which has a large 5.5in display and considerably faster components thanks to its top-end spec. Not everyone wants a massive smartphone, of course, but even the OnePlus X , which is a similar size to the 4.7in Galaxy A3 2016 and offers a similarly luxurious kind of build quality, only costs £199.. The A3 2016's got some pretty tough competition, then, but it's not a complete right-off before it's even got out of the gate. In fact, the A3 2016's quad-core 1.5GHz Exynos 7580 chip and 1.5GB of RAM put. up a surprisingly good fight against the OnePlus X's old Snapdragon 801 processor and 3GB of RAM, as our benchmark results weren't as far apart as you might expect.. If anything, the A3's Exynos chip is more akin to Qualcomm's current Snapdragon 615 chip, as its single core Geekbench 3 result of 701 puts it on a level playing field with the Moto X Play and Sony Xperia M4 Aqua. This is about 200 points slower than the OnePlus X, but Android 5.1.1 still felt lovely and smooth on the new A3 when flicking through its various menu screens.. The A3 also fell behind in the multicore test, but its score of 2,143 (up from 1,418 on last year's A3) was still only 300 points behind the X. This is pretty good going considering the X's Snapdragon 801 runs at a much faster clock speed of 2.3GHz, and in day-to-day use you'd be hard-pushed to see much of a difference.. Likewise, the A3's web browsing Peacekeeper score of 677 was within 100 points of the OnePlus X, and it proved very capable indeed when it came to handling media-heavy web pages. Scrolling could still be a little stop-start in places, particularly while pages were loading, but its smooth touchscreen felt very responsive once everything was ready to view.. The only area where it really loses out to the OnePlus X is its gaming performance, as its rather pitiful 254 frames (around 4.1fps) in the offscreen Manhattan 3.0 test in GFX Bench GL isn't that much better than an entry-level smartphone with a Snapdragon 410 inside it. It's still perfectly adequate for simple games like Threes!. but anyone looking to play more graphically-complex titles like Hearthstone should probably look elsewhere, as a quick round of Blizzard's card-trading game ended up being just a bit too juddery for my liking..

Samsung Galaxy A3 6 (2016) Review: We review the new 2016 edition of Samsung’s mid-range mini mobile, the 4.7-inch Galaxy A3, to see how it compares to the original 2015 Galaxy A3 .. Samsung has just re-released the Galaxy A3 in a fresh new form for 2016 and it could honestly be renamed the ‘Samsung Galaxy S6 Mini’, because that’s effectively what it is. For just over £200 you get a strong set of specs and that sexy Samsung design that’s suddenly emerged in the past 18 months.. So, is the Galaxy A3 2016 too good to be true? Here’s our full review.. We’re not kidding when we say that the Galaxy A3 6 looks like a slightly smaller sibling to the Galaxy S6. Size difference aside, they’re close to identical from every angle. You get the same clean front, the same matt metallic edging and that shiny glass back panel, which thankfully doesn’t scuff up too noticeably on the darker models. Port and button positioning is the same too and you’ll even find the same jutting camera lens poking out of the rear.. The Galaxy S6 was already quite comfortable to use one-handed, but the Galaxy A3 is even more so. That compact body fits pretty much any hand and means you can use the phone with just one mitt, no sweat. There’s a decent heft to the dinky frame too, so it doesn’t feel cheap or toy-like.. The A3 is surprisingly rugged too, putting up with quite a bit of punishment. That said, a good-sized drop onto a hard surface will likely be its undoing. Thankfully you can grab a selection of protective cases from MobileFun (who kindly provided our review model), like this subtle transparent cover from Olixar.. Ultimately, there’s very little to dislike about the Galaxy A3’s design. Unlike Samsung’s new Galaxy S7 , the A3 isn’t water-resistant; not a surprise at this price point, and we certainly didn’t miss it. And while that camera lens does poke out a wee bit, it never gets in the way and doesn’t even make the phone rock when you’re using it flat on a desk.. Check out our full unboxing video for a close-up look at the A3.. One feature that the Galaxy A3 6 thankfully doesn’t share with the Galaxy S7 is a lack of expandable storage. Pop open the A3’s SIM tray and you’ll see a memory card slot, so you can slip in a microSD card to boost the almost non-existent internal capacity.. That’s particularly good news if you want to carry around a massive collection of music and tunes, to enjoy offline. After all, not all of us can afford massive data-heavy contracts to stream from the likes of Netflix and Spotify on our commutes. And while the Galaxy A3’s 4.7-inch screen may be on the compact side, it’s still perfectly fine for enjoying some telly on your commute.. It’s a Super AMOLED display (obviously, this being a Samsung device), so colours are richly reproduced, while the powerful maximum brightness makes the A3 easy to view even in bright sunlight. Images are pleasingly crisp too, with the 720p resolution giving almost the same pixel density (312ppi) as the iPhone SE. That’s a serious step up from last year’s 4.5-inch Galaxy A3, which packed in just 245ppi. You’ll be squinting pretty hard to try and make out individual pixels.. Of course, the tiny bottom-mounted speaker can’t produce a very powerful sound, but audio quality is decent enough for kicking back with a YouTube video or two. You get some perfectly fine earbuds bundled in the A3’s box, which work in a pinch.. The only big miss between the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy A3 when it comes to features is the lack of a fingerprint sensor. That means you’re resigned to tapping in a PIN or pattern every time you want to unlock your phone, unless you’re happy to use Android’s Trusted Devices and Trusted Places security tools.. There’s no heart rate sensor on the back of the A3 either, but with so many fitness wearables now available on the cheap, we’d be surprised if anyone was bothered.. Android 5.1.1 comes pre-installed on the Galaxy A3, but we’re hopeful that this will be updated to Marshmallow shortly. For now Lollipop does the job, complete with Samsung’s usual TouchWiz tweaks; the interface is basically identical to the Galaxy S6’s layout, which is no bad thing.. There’s built-in Flipboard support which can thankfully be quickly deactivated and you get the usual array of Sammy and Microsoft apps pre-installed. The notifications bar and settings menu give you fast access to everything you use often and there’s a Themes app for tweaking the look and feel of the A3’s desktops.. One thing that Samsung hasn’t tweaked compared with last year’s Galaxy A3 is the processor that runs the show. The 2016 model still uses a Snapdragon 410 chipset, backed by 1.5GB of RAM. Thankfully we didn’t notice any stumbles or stutters when using the A3 for a full week, with apps loading quickly and menu browsing proving satisfyingly smooth.. Gaming is also perfectly possible, with some memory-intensive titles like Hitman Sniper running with a decent frame rate. Just don’t expect performance to be quite as smooth in a year or two, as the chipset is starting to age.. Battery life is another serious highlight. The Galaxy A3 kept us going for close to two days on a single charge, with standard use; plenty of web browsing and email checks, plus the odd bit of camera use and media playback. Even with heavy use you’ll happily see the day out, while non-stop video playback gives you around nine to ten hours of life. That’s one of the best results you’ll see on a modern mobile.. We’ve already fully tested the new Galaxy A3’s 13-megapixel camera and 5-megapixel selfie lens, along with Samsung’s camera app and various bonus modes. Check out our Galaxy A3 2016 camera review for more info.. Samsung’s Galaxy A3 2016 is essentially a mini Galaxy S6, boasting excellent battery life, strong optics and a great media experience, all wrapped up in a compact and gorgeous 4.7-inch package. If you want a mini mobile or simply can’t afford Samsung’s full-priced flagship phones, this Galaxy A3 refresh will definitely do the job..

Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) Smartphone Review. Andreas Kilian ( translated by Liala Stieglitz), 03/05/2016. Android Smartphone Touchscreen. The special feature of the former model was its aluminum unibody casing. Samsung now uses more glass in the new iteration. The screen of the mid-range smartphone has also been modified: It has a higher resolution while providing more space at the same time.

Best Notebooks for University Students Â». Top Windows alternatives to Apple's MacBook series Â». Â» Tablets , Â» Windows Tablets Â» Smartphones. For the original German review, see here.. Like the previous smartphones of the Galaxy A lineup, the new Galaxy A3 wants to stand out from its mid-range rivals with a special design and high-quality build. It is available in black, white, gold and rose gold in Germany. All have 16 GB of storage, 1.5 GB of RAM and the option of expanding the storage via a micro-SD card in common. While the German review sample only supports one nano-SIM card, a dual-SIM model of the A3 is available in other markets.. Listed at a price of 329 Euros (~$362), the smartphone is a bit more expensive than many other mid-range models. However, it could be purchased for about 280 Euros (~$308) at test time. Rivals with an equally sized screen are rare in this price range. Besides the direct predecessor , Wiko's Highway Pure can be counted to them, for example. Handsets with a 5-inch screen, such as Huawei's P8 lite , Motorola's Moto G , or Oneplus' X play in the same league. The Galaxy A3 also finds opponents in its own ranks from Samsung's Galaxy S5 Neo that has dropped in price considerably. Our in-depth review reveals how well the handset fares in this scenery..

Although the new Galaxy A3's 4.71-inch screen is bigger than that of the former model , it is only a bit over 4 millimeters longer. Its width (65.2 millimeters) and height (7.7 millimeters) have hardly changed. It is thus still much more compact than its rivals with 5-inch screens.. In contrast to the dominating aluminum material used on the back of last year's Galaxy A3 , it is made of Gorilla Glass in the new edition. The transitions to the metal lateral parts have been rounded, giving it a pleasant texture. The handset thus feels like it is one single part despite the different materials. The build is also on a very high level and is not in any way inferior to many premium-range models. However, a drawback of this design is that the casing's front and back are very sleek, and the smartphone easily slips from slanted surfaces. Also, very fine scratches appeared on our review sample despite careful handling.. The choice of materials also has an unfavorable effect on the weight. Compared with the predecessor , it has increased by 21 grams to 131 grams - the much bigger Huawei P8 lite is only 2 grams heavier. That, however, also contributes to the sensation of holding a particularly high-quality device in our hands.. The new Galaxy A3's stiffness is noticed very positively. It defies bending and warping attempts with flying colors, and without producing noises. Additionally, pressure on the back or front does not cause any distortions in displayed content.. Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team!. The storage capacity has not changed compared with last year's model. The device is still only available with 16 GB internal storage. Only approximately 10.7 GB of that is left for personal use. However, it can always be expanded via a micro-SD card as usual. Cards with a size of up to 128 GB can be used officially. It is also convenient that the memory card can be hot-swapped. Beyond that, the smartphone supports App2SD.. The interfaces have not been modified, either. Audio signals are transmitted via the 3.5 mm headset jack and a micro-USB port is present for data sharing. The latter supports USB-OTG, but not image output via MHL.. Although the handset can communicate via Wi-Fi Direct, it does not support Miracast. Media streaming via DLNA functioned in the local network without issues. An FM radio is also integrated.. It is too bad that Samsung does not install a dedicated notification LED. Users who do not want to miss this feature can simulate this on the AMOLED screen via third-party apps.. Lower edge: 3.5 mm headset jack, micro-USB port, speaker, microphone. The Android 5.1.1 operating system that Samsung covers with its TouchWiz user interface is installed. When or whether it will be updated to Android 6.0 Marshmallow is not known. However, a firmware update to version A310FXXU1APB7 was offered shortly after the test began, and all benchmarks and battery life tests were performed with it.. Samsung has made some modifications in the user interface. For example, a news-feed screen (Flipboard Briefing) is on the home screen's left by standard, but which can be faded out. A themes manager for adapting the operating system's appearance is also installed. Furthermore, the so-called Smart-Stay feature was enabled by default. It detects the user's face and prevents the screen from turning off regardless of the screen's timeout setting.. We also favorably noticed that Samsung only preloads very few third-party apps. Among them we only find Microsoft's Office apps that cannot be uninstalled but disabled.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The new Galaxy A3 only offers the standards in terms of Wi-Fi connectivity. The smartphone only supports 2.4 GHz frequencies, excluding connections to 5 GHz networks. The maximum gross data rate in the author's test setup was 72 Mbit/s (1 antenna, 20 MHz bandwidth) in conjunction with an Asus RT-AC56U router. The reception was on an average level. The smartphone's wireless module supports all frequencies common in Germany as well as LTE Cat.4 (max. 150 Mbit/s download & 50 Mbit/s upload). Bluetooth version 4.1 and NFC are installed for wireless near field communication.. The integrated GPS module very quickly found the actual position outdoors. The reception was barely affected even in many indoor areas, such as a ground-level supermarket. Then again, a stable reception was no longer possible far from a window in an apartment in the third story of a 4-story apartment building. To find out how the handset fares in real-world use, we recorded a route with both the Garmin Edge 500 GPS bike navigation system and the Galaxy A3. Although the area of the railway underpass shows that the smartphone tends to straighten difficult sections, the Garmin navigation system also had some problems. Although its recorded route is clearly not as straight, it consistently deviates a few meters from the actual route to begin with. Since the smartphone does not exhibit any major discrepancies, it should be sufficient for navigating purposes.. The Galaxy A3's phone app offers the standard features, such as favorites, a call list and directly accessing the phonebook. A keypad also fades in by default when it is opened.. The call quality was throughout convincing in test calls via the 3G network of the German Telecom. The voice quality was impeccable on both sides during normal calls using the earpiece with its very high volume settings as well as when using the included headset. There was no interference and background noises like traffic were suppressed well. Although the contact perceived the voice of the Galaxy A3 user as marginally quieter in a direct comparison, the sound quality did not suffer. Only the averagely high maximum volume of the smartphone's speaker could lead to problems in noisier environments.. Reviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other.

The primary camera in the new Galaxy A3 has a resolution of 13 megapixels and offers an aperture of f/1.9. That is a clear improvement over the predecessor that was furnished with an 8-megapixel camera - at least in terms of resolution. However, most rivals now feature an equally good configuration. It is positive that the camera unit only juts out of the casing by approximately 0.8 millimeters, making it possible to place the handset quite stably on its back.. The photos are compelling in bright conditions: Their sharpness, noise behavior and illumination are good (scene 1). However, looking closer at the photos reveals a slight haziness in both upper corners that is, however, only noticed on specific objects. The image quality is poorer in difficult situations - for example in twilight or dim rooms. The image noise then also increases in dark areas (scene 3). Additionally, the occasional blurred photo will be inevitable under these circumstances due to the lack of an optical image stabilizer. The relatively sluggish auto-focus that does not always function accurately in low-light conditions makes things more difficult since it has obvious problems focusing objects. Fortunately, the bright LED flash can lessen the problem a bit - at least in the near field.. The primary camera records videos in at most the Full HD resolution and 30 frames per second. The image quality is very decent, but the auto-focus is also often sluggish here particularly when the scene changes quickly or in difficult light conditions.. The front-facing camera with fixed focus has a resolution of 5 megapixels and provides useful results in good ambient light conditions. However, the photos blur as soon as less light falls on the sensor. It also records videos in the Full HD resolution at 30 frames per second.. The camera's software allows choosing between an "Auto" and "Pro" mode with extra settings, among other things. HDR photos are only possible via a special mode. It is handy that the camera app can be opened directly from standby by double-tapping the home button.. Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3. Choose a scene and navigate within the first image. One click changes the position on touchscreens. One click on the zoomed-in image opens the original in a new window. The first image shows the scaled photograph of the test device.. Original colors are displayed in the lower half of each patch.. To test the color accuracy of the Galaxy A3's primary camera, we compare the screenshot of the X-Rite ColorChecker Passport taken under controlled light conditions with the factual reference colors. The pictures are not edited afterwards, e.g. The comparison shows that the smartphone almost consistently tends to oversaturate colors as well as slightly increase the brightness. The latter is also true for the medium grayscale levels.. To evaluate the image sharpness, we photographed our test chart as full-frame as possible in defined light conditions. The sharpness decrease particularly in the left upper edge, which was already noticed in the real-world photos, is seen again. The reproduction in the image's center is very decent, and even the iPhone 6S is defeated in terms of resolution here.. Samsung Galaxy A3 - test picture. In addition to the compulsory brochures that include a quick-start guide and warranty conditions, the review sample was shipped with a tool for opening the card slot and a 7.75 watt plug (1.55 A / 5 V) and the corresponding micro-USB cable. Beyond that, a white in-ear headset was included. The manufacturer offers a Flip Cover and a transparent Clear Cover specifically made for the Galaxy A3 at 29.90 Euros (~$32) each.. Samsung's warranty covers a period of 24 months. That, however, excludes the battery where a 12-month warranty is stated.. The review sample's touchscreen protected by Gorilla Glass responds very accurately to inputs and detects the lightest touch reliably. The glass surface has an especially pleasing feel thanks to its rounded lateral edges. The onscreen keyboard can also be used well although the room for it is smaller than in smartphones with bigger screens. Samsung's standard keyboard also supports word suggestions and swiping. The latter has to first be enabled in the settings.. The touch buttons below the screen also do a reliable job. They are backlit for approximately one-and-a-half seconds after an input. power button, both volume controls and home button, have a crisp pressure point and firm fit. They thus contribute to the smartphone's high-quality looks.. Generally, the operating system mostly responded to the user's inputs without lags. It sometimes only took a moment for opening a function when larger apps were closed or updates ran in the background. The image rotated quickly when turning the smartphone.. Samsung's new Galaxy A3 sports a 4.71-inch Super AMOLED panel with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. The resulting pixel density of 312 PPI is higher than that of last year's model (245 PPI) despite the bigger screen diagonal. The review sample thus places itself between those rivals with 294 to 441 PPI. However, pixel structures and light color fringing are very visible when looking close at content despite this sufficiently high pixel density. Color fringing could particularly appear at the edges of homogeneously colored surfaces. This minor shortcoming will unlikely be noticed in routine use.. The review sample achieves a brightness of 386 cd/mÂ² in the center on a pure white screen. That seems to be a step backward compared with the precursor's 434 cd/mÂ² at first. However, our more significant measurements with equally distributed bright and dark areas on the screen (Average Picture Level / APL 50) reveals that the new Galaxy A3 still has some reserves. We ascertained a maximum of 466 cd/mÂ². The smartphone even shines with up to 659 cd/mÂ² when the light sensor is enabled. The device additionally benefits from the AMOLED panel's rich black level that leads to a very high contrast both subjectively and objectively.. 427 cd/m² 392 cd/m² 381 cd/m² 414 cd/m² 386 cd/m² 374 cd/m² 412 cd/m² 387 cd/m² 376 cd/m². 88 % Center on Battery: 386. cd/m²) ΔE Color 1.11 | 0.8-23.34 Ø6.4 ΔE Greyscale 1.34 | 0.64-98 Ø6.7 Gamma: 2.12.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) Screen flickering / PWM detected 240.4 Hz. To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.. The display backlight flickers at 240.4. Hz is relatively low, so sensitive users will likely notice flickering and experience eyestrain at the stated brightness setting and below.. % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display.

This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (42.2 ms).. Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.. Like many Samsung smartphones, the Galaxy A3 has several color profiles for the user to choose from. "Basic" mode offers the most accurate color reproduction in the sRGB color space: With an average DeltaE shift of 1.34 in grayscale and 1.11 in colors (ideal range: <3), the new Galaxy A3 can clearly outclass all comparison devices and even some considerably more expensive smartphones like the iPhone 6S. The shifts in "Photo" mode focused on the AdobeRGB color space are also within tight limits. That looks different in "Cinema" mode that primarily relies on much higher saturated colors and also has a much cooler color temperature with 7278 K than both other modes (ideal rate: 6500 K; "Basic" 6441 K; "Cinema": 6404 K). Users who do not want to think about the color reproduction can simply leave it up to automatic mode set by default.. Grayscale (Profile: Basic, target color space sRGB).

Thanks to the bright, high-contrast AMOLED panel, content can be recognized well even in direct sunlight.. Outdoors in the sun with reflections. The viewing-angle stability of the installed screen is very good as is typical for AMOLED. Inverting is not an issue due to the construction, and the brightness decrease when looking at the screen from the side is marginal. However, a minor drop in color temperature towards cooler colors then becomes visible.. While last year's model featured a Qualcomm SoC, the new Galaxy A3 sports a chip by Samsung. The new Exynos 7578 quad-core processor has four Cortex A53 cores that clock at a maximum of 1.5 GHz. Like the predecessor , it finds support in a rather scanty 1.5 GB of working memory. Apart from Motorola's Moto G , the comparison devices all have more to offer here. An ARM Mali T720 GPU is responsible for video output.. The review sample holds its ground quite well despite these relatively weak-looking components on paper: While it at least can keep the Snapdragon 410 SoC based rival in check in the AnTuTu benchmark and Geekbench 3, it can even outperform Huawei's P8 lite furnished with an octa-core processor in PCMark. The new Galaxy A3 also looks impressive in the graphics benchmarks.. Although defeated by OnePlus X and the Galaxy S5 Neo in the offscreen tests of 3DMark and GFXBench, the latter is even surpassed in the onscreen benchmarks thanks to its screen's lower resolution. Thus, Samsung's new Exynos 7578 SoC does not ensure any new best rates in the comparison with the rivals, but it can hold its own well especially in the graphics tests..

An ARM Mali T720 GPU is responsible for video output in the Galaxy A3 (2016). It does its job amazingly well: Even performance-driven games like Asphalt 8 are still smooth in high settings. The smartphone certainly benefits from its not extremely high screen resolution of 1280x720 pixels. The graphics chip would have to work harder for the same performance with a Full HD panel. Of course, games like Angry Birds 2 that do not have such high hardware requirements run smoothly on the handset.. The integrated position sensors and sensitive touchscreen also function impeccably in games.. The Galaxy A3 shines in terms of maximum heat dissipation. Idle temperatures of below 30 Â°C are nothing special, but the smartphone fares particularly well under load. Like the slightly bigger Galaxy S5 Neo , the review sample reaches at most a moderate 34.7 Â°C here. Only the direct predecessor does an even better job. OnePlus' X proves that not every smartphone can offer these low temperatures with a hot spot of 47.5 Â°C.. We use the battery test of GFXBench to check whether these agreeably low temperatures are not the result of a continuous performance reduction of the installed components. It runs the T-Rex test 30 times in succession and records both the available performance and battery consumption. Fortunately, the outcomes only deviate within a range of one percent point, which excludes throttling.. 34.7 °C 33.4 °C 31.5 °C. 34.5 °C 32.9 °C 31.2 °C. 33.7 °C 32.6 °C 31 °C.

While the speaker in last year's Galaxy A3 was still found on the rear, it is now situated on the handset's lower edge. Thus, sound is no longer impaired when the smartphone is placed on a table.. Subjectively, the sound quality is surprisingly good for a mono speaker. Music and voice are rendered quite naturally and balanced, and even some bass is audible. Tones are not distorted even at maximum volume, which could be a bit higher, though.. We measured the speaker's sound and created a Pink Noise diagram. It illustrates that the mid to high frequencies of approximately 600 Hz to 12 kHz are rendered relatively consistently. The maximum volume of 84.38 dB(A) is sufficiently high to at least fill smaller rooms with sound.. Unlike the inferior headphones found in the boxes of some mid-range devices, Samsung includes a decent headset that reaps in plus points with its vivid bass and balanced sound.. In terms of power consumption, the review sample does a much better job than its somewhat bigger sister model Galaxy S5 Neo. Although the rates have clearly climbed compared with the Galaxy A3 from 2015, they can only be compared conditionally because we have been using a new and more accurate measuring device recently. However, OnePlus' X proves that even less is possible with better rates despite the new metrology.. The included power supply has a maximum output of 7.75 watts and completely recharges the non-removable battery with a capacity of approximately 8.7 Wh within 2 hours. The Galaxy A3 cannot offer wireless charging or Quick Charge functionality.. Off / Standby 0 / 0.15 Watt Idle 0.96 / 1.39 / 1.45 Watt. The new Galaxy A3's time has come in battery life. It is superior to the comparison devices in virtually every test. Only the Galaxy S5 Neo lasts a bit longer in full load. The comparison with Huawei's P8 lite shows just how big the advantage sometimes is: While the review sample managed a very good 14 hours and 23 minutes in video playback, the rival is depleted in not even half the time. However, it must be pointed out that the brightness is automatically dimmed at a battery state of less than 5%, and it cannot be increased manually.. Additional energy-saving mechanisms can be enabled to increase the smartphone's battery life even more. Besides the standard energy-savings mode that is to save energy via reduced performance, disabled key light and reduced frame rate frequencies, an ultra-energy-savings mode is present.

In review: Samsung Galaxy A3 (SM-A310F). Review sample courtesy of Samsung Germany.. Samsung's reiteration of the Galaxy A3 holds many advantages. One is the stiff casing's high-quality build that tactually convinces with rounded glass at the edges and a metal bezel. Drawbacks of this design are the non-removable battery and the slightly too sleek back.. However, the device has quite a bit to offer technically. The excellent screen, the option of expanding the 16 GB internal storage via micro-SD and very long battery life are primarily convincing. Qualities that many smartphone users will appreciate. While NFC is on board, the integrated Wi-Fi module unfortunately still only supports data sharing via the 2.4 band. Samsung's new quad-core SoC does not break any records, but it convinces with performance suitable for routine use in the Galaxy A3.. In contrast to that, the quality of the installed camera modules makes a mixed impression. While photos taken in good light conditions are very compelling with their decent sharpness and good resolution, less ideal conditions often cause disappointment. The sluggish and frequently inaccurate auto-focus and the tendency to underexpose the photos are aggravating here.. Samsung has created an especially high-quality mid-range smartphone that can primarily convince with an excellent screen and outstanding battery life.. Equally priced alternatives for the Galaxy A3, which have a similar screen size, are rare. Users who do not have problems with a bigger screen could take a look at, for example, the somewhat more expensive Galaxy S5 that achieved an even better total rating of 87% in our test..

(I am used to having a plastic bodied phone so this was a great upgrade) -Battery life lasts almost two days and charges very quickly -Beautiful Samsung screen (of course) -Last, but definitely not least, it's CHEAP! (cases are cheap for it too) Cons -No battery access (to be expected with an aluminum phone and not a huge deal, I just always like to have that option) -Both back and front cameras are very grainy and have motion blurring problems, but gets the job done. (If you like a good camera phone this phone is a no-go for you) -Speakers on the back. (just a pet peeve of mine) The speakers are average in tonal quality and loudness. I love this phone and have been using it for a few months now with no problems at all. This phone is a fantastic buy for anyone looking for a solid phone without the need for expensive bells and whistles. Fantastic price for this phone, would definitely​ buy it again.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars samsung a3 the best phone. I like a lot, especially because you can use any chip anywhere in the world. Was this review helpful to you?. 2.0 out of 5 stars If you dont have a US sim for international unlocking, look elsewhere. Phone looks great and feels great in the hand but if you are thinking of using this phone outside the America's and dont have a US activation sim, dont waste your time and money. The sellers dont make it clear that this phone is locked for use on other continents unless you first use it the US. This important detail is not in the product description but is tucked away in the Q&A section. If you dont have a US sim card, look somewhere else for a cool looking smart phone..

This phone is awesome, very handy, smal in size, light in wight, very productive, as for the shopping experience ; it was very good, package arriveed on time, well packing, sealed close and new as described, worked with any SIM card #Unlocked.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Love the look, but could be better. I love the look but the processor isn't as good as the S4. in 4 months of owning it, it has frozen twice when performing heavy loads, you can't remove the battery so you have to let it die. I still love the phone and the 5mp front camera is the best you will find. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. Very nice I like it and it was according to the description.

The phone features a quad-core processor, a 4.7-inch HD display and 4G connectivity.. Aloysius Low /. The A3 has a rear 13-megapixel camera.. Aloysius Low /.
