Meizu M6 Note - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 8 9 ». Anonymous, 13 Feb 2018 Dont think so, I believe bands are hardare specific and can't be changed via software. Anonymous, 15 Jan 2018 Does it have a USB C or micro usb? Mocro usb only. BadMF, 10 Feb 2018 Does China version support B20 (LTE 800 mhz) when ROM is changed to Global? Dont think so, I believe bands are hardare specific and can't be changed via software.. Comparing this with the Mi A1.. soranerr0r, 07 Feb 2018 Of course Does China version support B20 (LTE 800 mhz) when ROM is changed to Global?. Anonymous, 10 Jan 2018 Hi m6n user I have a question that is if I buy a Chinese rom now in future meizu will release ... Cheap and very good.Dual camera with great front camera, good processor (nothing special), good build qualit..Thumps up.. Purchased one from China which took almost 5 weeks to arrive! Shipped...well, by ship I guess lol! Anyway on the first evening of ownership I dropped it in the toilet! It was submerged for the usual "what was that...fuck my phone...quick grab it out immediately moment" about 6 seconds i'd estimate! Anyway a week in rice later and the screen had almost 100% recovered and the only damage left over from the incident is a small 1mm x 1mm blob where the screen is slightly brighter than the rest of it. The Meizu M6 Note is highly fluid damage resistant but it is far from water proof or resistant. It absolutely isn't so don't be an idiot like me, I was utterly wounded!. The next day, I was riding my road bike and something fell from my coat pocket, yep my M6 Note! I ran over it before I even understood what I was running over! Guess what? The Meizu M6 Note is VERY damage resistant! Not a single dent in its aluminium uni-body, not a scratch! OK, It is protected with a thin TPU case an a crappy glass screen protector that isn't made specifically for this device, so doesn't cover the whole screen, but a bike running it over with the screen face down on the street, all with my 160lbs of weight on top of it, you'd think it would have sustained some damage. The only mark left from its second disaster since arriving in the UK is a tiny scratch to the right of the M Touch button where the crappy glass screen protector does not cover, and where it must have impacted a small stone on the road. It is UNBELIEVABLE that the screen didn't completely shatter! Since then I have managed to keep the phone safe and well, with no more accidents! So to sum up, Its a very good cheap device at the £150 price point. The build quality is amazing, with the entire device being beautifully CNC'd from a lump of aluminium and finished off with a perfect coat of tough and attractive anodizing. Of particular design excellence is the way Meizu have blended the antenna bands, its possibly the best incorporation i have seen on any phone with them simply blending into the device. Meizu have also used the same aluminium on the top and bottom ends of the phone as the body is constructed from, so unlike a lot of devices, some more expensive than the Note 6, where the top and bottom ends are made from a badly fitting plastic that makes the whole device appear like a cheap piece of shite, Meizu's M6 stands out for its absolutely excellent high end build quality. Xiaomi, UMI and others take note!. Performance, is basically excellent with the device being more than fast enough for the vast majority of people. The battery is amazing and could last almost 2 days with the screen brightness being kept lowish. I havent a single issue with its performance. The screen is really good, just a typical 5.5" 1080P job. The cameras are the only area where I think it could improve. They are far from bad however, you can take really good pictures but more often than not, I get blurred images and have to stand statue still to guarantee a perfect shot. Not a deal breaker, but disappointing given the rest of the phone is stunning. The sound system is fookin excellent, very loud and loads of low frequency that you can actually hear. This device has the best single speaker ive heard on a smartphone. Conclusion; For a lot less than £200 in the UK, this phone is a bargain. A say, Samsung of the same, even twice the price would be garbage in comparison i am sure!. Anonymous, 15 Jan 2018 Does it have a USB C or micro usb? The Meizu m6 note has Micro usb. Runs on 4G network in Canada.. There are China Versions (Q) or Global Versions (H).. These phones are quite hard to find, Gearbest had stock but sold out and according to them they are very popular and sell out quickly. Ordered min from Tinydeal and two days later they were also out of stock. These are really great phones and once I figured out flymeos I actually prefer it over stock android, got so many features.. sunny, 21 Jan 2018 does anyone know if i can order it from Canada? like anyway i can get one in Canada? You can order them from amazon.com but they ship from china. I just imported mine direct from china as it was way cheaper even with dhl shipping.. sunny, 21 Jan 2018 does anyone know if i can order it from Canada? like anyway i can get one in Canada? probably only through ebay.. does anyone know if i can order it from Canada? like anyway i can get one in Canada?. i wish i could get it in Canada....

Features Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features Dual-camera (5-megapixel, F2.0 aperture), Autofocus, CMOS image sensor. Software Features Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes Burst mode, High Dynamic Range mode (HDR), Panorama, Effects. Camcorder 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (30 fps). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 2000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 14 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists. Features Album art cover, Background playback. GSM 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD) Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20. CDMA - Code Division Multiple Access.

Features Mass storage device, USB charging. Other VoIP, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Meizu M6 Note uses Snapdragon 625 and runs Android 7.1.2 Nougat, however, I don't know if Camera2 API is supported by this device. I would surely buy this thing if it can do HDR+ using modded Google Camera app!

The device launched two month ago in China so MEIZU hasn't even released this device firmware. That means no TWRP recovery yet. MEIZU also going to launch this phone globally in a few months so the best thing for now is wait. (They announced that they going to launch this phone soon in Greece). I really believe this device would get a good community support as SD625+Sony IMX 362 makes a great combo. The camera really destroys even the Mi6 sensor in some ocations and the phone only cost 140€ for the 16gb version. Also don't forget the quite superior front facing camera. I was going to get the mi a1 but when I saw this bad boy I knew this is the phone I'll get.. Do I need a custom recovery installed on my phone before I can use the magisk module? I don't believe Meizu phones have that. Join Date: Joined: Jun 2011. bootloader not unlocked,twrp not yet available,also custom rom not available. Can a custom ROM enable it?.

M6 Note marks the welcome return of Snapdragon power to Meizu phones. Following Qualcomm settlement, Meizu to use all three major makers' processors. Despite having only very recently revealed the dual-screen Pro 7 , Meizu has now launched another phone: The M6 Note.. We’re particularly excited by two of the new features introduced to the M6 Note, a member of the company’s core high-spec affordable M-series range, that represent significant steps forward for the brand, and its appeal to international users.. The first, and perhaps most welcome, change is the introduction of a Qualcomm processor. In the past Meizu has used Samsung Exynos or MediaTek chips, but the recent settlement of a patent case with Qualcomm has made a return possible. It’s the Snapdragon 625, a 2.0GHz octa-core chip introduced in early 2016, used in phones including the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X , the Huawei Nova , and the Motorola Moto G5 Plus .. Meizu has told Digital Trends that going forward it “will use all three major [system-on-chip manufacturers]; Samsung Exynos, Qualcomm Snapdragon, and MediaTek. Each one offers a unique advantage and will complement our products differently.”. In the M6 Note, that 625 chipset is accompanied by either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. It’s especially good at conserving energy, which we hope will make the device a strong performer when it comes to battery life. It should be great, as Meizu has put a large, fast-charging 4,000mAh cell inside the phone.. In addition to the new processor, the M6 Note has a dual-lens rear camera, ensuring it’s right up to date with the latest smartphone trend. The main lens has 12 megapixels with an f/1.9 aperture, and the secondary lens has 5 megapixels. It’s not clear how the lenses work together yet, and whether it will replicate the blurred-background bokeh effect; but we do know it has some clever software included for different effects. Meizu highlighted the camera’s low-light performance on its Twitter feed , where it compared very favorably against the Huawei P10 .. Like most Meizu phones, the M6 Note has a metal body, which weighs 173 grams, and there is a 5.5-inch screen on the front with a stadium-shaped fingerprint sensor underneath. The screen has a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution. A 16-megapixel selfie camera with an f/2.0 aperture sits above the display, and has a beauty mode along with other fun software features. Android 7.0 Nougat is installed with Meizu’s Flyme user interface over the top.. The Meizu M6 Note comes with either 3GB or 4GB of RAM, and 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of internal storage space. You also get the choice of three colors: black, blue, or gold. The price hasn’t been announced, and neither has the precise release date, or where it will be sold. Expect the M6 Note to be available in China, and in Meizu’s other primary markets, but not in the United States..
