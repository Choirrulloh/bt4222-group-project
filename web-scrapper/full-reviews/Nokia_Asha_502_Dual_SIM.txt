HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT , SUCH A TERRIBLE MOBILE FROM NOKIA !!!. i bought this mobile on feb 3rd from a local mobile store for rs 5650 /-. i read many reviews before buying nokia asha 502 , i was convenced that it wont disappoint me. but i was 100% wrong its such a terrible mobile. missing some basic and important features which every mobile should have especially when you are purchasing it for more than 5 K. IT DOESNT HAVE CUT , COPY , PASTE , MARK / MARK ALL & SAVE OPTIONS. IT PROVIDES MAIL SERVICE BUT IN THAT YOU CANT ATTACH A FILE TO THE MAIL AND WHEN YOU OPEN A MAIL IT OPENS WITH A CODE ALLOVER. MESSAGING IN THIS MOBILE IS A PAIN , IT DOESNT HAVE SENT , DRAFT , INBOX OPTION. it doesnt even provide download/save option when you view a photo on facebook...etc. CHARGER (USB) :- its charger pin is to be plugged in the USB port , no otherway to charge. NOKIA MUSIC STORE PROBLEM :- there is a problem with the music store everytime i go to download it says "something went wrong" ???. OPERATING :- UI , operating is abit complicated which indeed makes the user feel irritated sometimes. CAMERA :- coming to 5 mp camera with flash ,first of all it doesnt seem to be 5 mp for sure ,by seeing the pictures one would say that 2 mp camera is better than this one !!!. and then coming to music player , i previously used to have nokia 5230 in which i used to listen to songs everyday but listening songs from this one is unbearable after 4,5 songs u will just stop the song n unplug the headphones. Battery life :- even when it comes to battery life if you use this mobile normally then only it will come for almost a day (that too with doubt). a review which i read just now mentioning that the mobile has a scratch mark on the touchscreen and also on the cover of the mobile is true i mean even for me it happened i dont know why they transport such goods so roughly. iam a big fan of nokia iam using nokia mobiles since my graduation like nokia 3230 , nokia 108 , nokia 5230 , nokia c1-01. now all that respect i have for nokia brand has fallen to half. nokia asha 502 is a terrible mobile dont buy it. LOOKS & DESIGN DISPLAY FLASH INBUILT WHATSAPP , FACEBOOK , TWITTER , MAIL. IT DOESNT HAVE CUT , COPY , PASTE , MARK , MARK ALL , SAVE OPTIONS CHARGING THROUGH USB PORT , NO OTHERWAY COMPLICATED USER INTERFACE/OPERATING NO ATTACH A FILE IN MAIL BATTERY IS AVERAGE , IF YOU USE IT NORMAL THEN IT WILL SURVIVE A DAY.

Author Bharadwaj Chandramouli Posted on January 13, 2014 January 15, 2014 Categories Featured , Handsets , India , Nokia , Photo Gallery. The Nokia Asha 502 , announced as a part of the new range of Asha devices at Nokia World, was recently unboxed in our studio. Sporting the all new frost iced look for the outer shell, the bright red Asha 502 immediately caught our fancy. The petite device was very photogenic at first glance, so here we are with a full fledged photo gallery, showing off the brilliant looking case and all of the hardware of the Nokia Asha 502. Skip past the break to find the rest of the pictures.. This is the Nokia Asha 502. It looks like a Asha 501 no doubt, but the bright red colour still shows through to the front, thanks to the translucent frost casing on the outside. You have the 3″ QVGA display, above which sits the ear piece and the Nokia logo.. Below the display we have the lone “back” capacitive touch button.. Over at the top we have the 3.5mm audio jack and the micro USB port for charging and data transfers.. And over at the bottom we have the microphone for voice calls.. The bright red back nicely shows off the frost casing in a dark background. You can see the 5 MP camera with a single LED flash and the loud speaker on the back of this phone.. The left side is flush and doesn’t have any buttons while the right side has the buttons for the lock/power switch and the volume rocker.. Underneath the removable back cover we have the two SIM card slots and the micro SD card slot.. The battery inside is a BL-5A 1010 mAH unit powering the 2G modem unlike that of the Nokia Asha 503’s 1200 mAH unit.. In the end, we really like the design, the colour and the build quality of the Nokia Asha 502 and we hope this photo gallery paints a decent picture of what to expect from this device. Here are some more pictures for you to gaze upon until we bring out the full review soon –.
