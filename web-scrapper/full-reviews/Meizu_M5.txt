more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. by Victor Hristov. 4 Call Quality, Battery life and Conclusion. Introduction If you live in the United States, chances are you’ve never heard of Chinese phone maker Meizu. The company has grown to sell some 22 million phones in 2016, with almost 90% of them sold in China. That ranks it among the bigger phone makers over in the world’s most populous nation, and with that popularity, some enthusiasts who have heard about the brand might wonder: what’s special about Meizu phones? How would they work if you import one to the U.S.? Actually, certain Meizu handsets do end up being sold through some European retailers, but the exposure is patchy at best. The Meizu M5 that we have up for review here is the company’s most affordable phone: a 5.2 incher with an entry level MediaTek system chip, it still packs the important for security fingerprint scanner and a few other extras. Join us for our full Meizu M5 review to see whether it’s worth considering for buyers who are willing to experiment with importing a phone from China. Design The M5 is made of semi-matte plastic which feels warm and inviting, plus it looks good and does not get smudged with fingerprints. The Meizu M5 is an affordable phone, and you can tell by its design: it’s an all-plastic body that, depending on the color, might fool you into thinking you are looking at a metal phone from afar. It’s not, but the semi-matte plastic on it feels nice to touch and does not catch annoying fingerprint smudges. The body itself is neither too thick, nor among the thinnest: it measures 0.31 inches (8 mm) in thickness. The phone is also fairly light-weight at just 4.9 ounces (138 grams). The right screen and body size for a phone is a subjective matter, but it feels like 5.2 inches is around the golden mean: neither too large, nor too small. This is a nice size that will suit many people. The fingerprint scanner is a nice extra for such an affordable phone: it is fast and fairly reliable, we had no issues with it. You should also know that the phone uses a microUSB port for charging, no fancy USB-C port here. And yes, it has a 3.5mm headset jack. Finally, you have five color options to choose from: mint green, champagne, matte black, glacier white, and sapphire blue, which is more than sufficient variety. Display A 5.2” display with cold, bluish colors that appear slightly washed out. It’s not too bad, but it’s definitely one of the weak points of the phone. The Meizu M5 sports a 5.2” IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. The screen is usually one of the weakest points in an affordable phone, and the Meizu M5 is no exception. First, there is a noticeable light bleed on the top of the display on our unit (a slight one on the bottom as well). Secondly, colors are on the cold side: whites appear bluish and overall colors are not perfectly balanced. The screen definitely lacks in liveliness, colors look a bit washed out. Good news is that the screen gets fairly bright (we measured peak brightness of 466 nits) and it’s not too reflective, so it’s reasonably easy to read what’s on the display even on a bright, sunny day. The 720 x 1280 pixel resolution works out to a pixel density of 282 ppi. What this number means is you can see some slight pixelization and jagged edges here and there. We don’t find this to be a major issue, though (the bluish colors seem like a bigger issue in daily use), but again, something to consider. We should also note that there is an ambient light sensor – and believe it or not some affordable phones still lack one – that adjusts screen brightness automatically. It is a bit on the slow side and does not gradually adjust the brightness, but instead jumps abruptly from dark to bright. Still, it works, and we’re happy with both how bright, but also how dark the screen can get at night, so that it does not hurt your eyes when you read in bed.. 5.8 x 2.87 x 0.31 inches. 147.2 x 72.8 x 8 mm. 6.02 x 3.02 x 0.39 inches. 153 x 76.6 x 9.8 mm. 5.6 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches. 142.2 x 71.4 x 7.9 mm. 6.05 x 2.97 x 0.32 inches. 153.6 x 75.5 x 8.2 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

Also - 2 of the items on your cons list are based on global availability/compatibility, which the Company chooses. When the original iPhone was released, did you knock it for only being available in limited countries?. (Posts: 671; Member since: 23 Mar 2013). posted on 17 Jan 2017, 09:56. Positives, taken straight from your review. - Battery life is great, mitigating long charge time for inexpensive phone. - Limited Global Availability/compatibility was intentional! They should not be knocked for this!. You guys state apps pause when opening, but they run smoothly once doing so. Please - Reconsider your 5 rating considering the price. You guys are expecting a flagship phone at a low-range price lol? WTF Phonearena?. Rating should be at minimum a 7.5. posted on 17 Jan 2017, 10:56. Did you even read the review or did you just jump to the pros - cons, and then decide to complain?. "The Meizu M5 is a likable affordable phone made in China and made for China. The goal of our review, however, is to understand how it will perform for the Western customer.". (Posts: 671; Member since: 23 Mar 2013). posted on 17 Jan 2017, 14:13. "The goal of our review, however, is to understand how it will perform for the Western customer.". Incredibly stupid to do this, come to the conclusion it's a great phone if it's NOT for a Western customer, then award it a poor 5 rating. This is like me reviewing an AT&T iPhone 7 Plus in Antarctica and giving it a 2 because it didn't work.. (Posts: 2066; Member since: 23 Jan 2014). posted on 17 Jan 2017, 13:50. Also they reviewed the phone as if the intended distribution method is grey import. It's quite baffling that they reviewed the phone from a US point of view as opposed to the point of view of the intended markets. If they can do they, they should've reviewed the Exynos S7.. (Posts: 2315; Member since: 14 Aug 2014). posted on 17 Jan 2017, 09:59. Nice...PA gimme the phone I'll kindly have it.. (Posts: 17; Member since: 17 Mar 2016). posted on 17 Jan 2017, 10:15. Meizu M5 (Charging time 189 mins) - Listed as con for "battery is very slow to recharge". Apple iPhone 7 Plus (Charging time 197 mins).... Slow to recharge was not even mentioned once.. (Posts: 671; Member since: 23 Mar 2013). posted on 17 Jan 2017, 10:22. Phonearena - A phone almost 8x more expensive wasn't knocked for charging time. I'm not trying to be rude here, but you guys seriously need to wake up. Consistency is crucial when you're a reviewer. (Posts: 6747; Member since: 30 Sep 2014). posted on 17 Jan 2017, 10:44.

(Posts: 418; Member since: 05 Jan 2015). posted on 17 Jan 2017, 11:36. The 32GB M5 is available for only $135.99 on sites like TO2C. Like most Chinese phones, it comes with LTE Bands 1, 3 and 7, no good for the US but OK on 4 Canadian carriers - Rogers, Fido, Bell & Virgin all of which have LTE Band 7 (2600) - not Telus or Koodo though - need Band 4 for these carriers. A much better phone for this price range is the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime - bigger battery (4100 mAh) and SD430 - a great, speedy SOC.. (Posts: 2293; Member since: 31 Oct 2011). posted on 17 Jan 2017, 14:23. Eh, be careful with Band 7 coverage. For Bell, it is *very* limited. Outside of pockets of major cities, you won't get any coverage on Band 7.. (Posts: 418; Member since: 05 Jan 2015). posted on 20 Jan 2017, 05:25. Not a problem on Fido, but then I don't travel from home very much so I have never noticed any problem. I've been using Chinese phones on LTE Band 7 for about 3 years now with no lack of coverage.. (Posts: 1; Member since: 16 Jan 2017). posted on 17 Jan 2017, 22:55. I find people stupid for not understanding Meizu and it's flyme os, it's seriously the best in out there, use a flyme os for a month snd you will understand my point. (Posts: 418; Member since: 05 Jan 2015). posted on 19 Jan 2017, 05:37. Typical review shows ignorance of Canadian LTE bands. So typical to talk about LTE availability in Asia, Europe and the US, not knowing that there are 4 carriers in Canada with LTE Band 7 (2600) so that this phone along with many others made in China DO get LTE access in Canada on those carriers. At least this reviewer didn't make the mistake of referring to North America as if that covered every country in North America.. posted on 31 Jan 2017, 04:51. Wow a really good review, but have you seen the agm a2??. (Posts: 3; Member since: 10 Feb 2017). posted on 10 Feb 2017, 14:32. Absolutely every reviewer on every website somehow fails to mention while reviewing a Meizu device that every Meizu phone can be rooted from Settings without losing warranty, software updates and even OTAs.. * Some comments have been hidden, because they don't meet the discussions rules..

The M5 is Chinese firm Meizu’s latest stab at the budget smartphone market. It’s an import-only model, however, with only a select few retailers in the UK actually selling the handset.. With its 5.2-inch display and 4G connectivity, this is a budget phone that many less demanding users will appreciate. However, up against the Xiaomi Redmi 3 , its appeal is limited.. The M5 feels as cheap as it is. The plastic shell is relatively robust but it doesn’t stand up to increased pressure, plus it’s prone to picking up sweaty marks almost as soon as you start using the phone. Other phones use a material that allows moisture to dissipate, but this isn’t the case here; there were multiple occasions whilst using the M5 where I had to wipe it on my shirt to keep it from becoming slippery.. Its slippery nature isn’t helped by the smooth curves around its edges, and in fact, the first thing I did with the M5 was to drop it onto the floor of a bus. To its credit, it survived unscathed.. The handset weighs just 138g, which is pretty light for a phone of this size. Its 8.2mm thickness is also very pocket-friendly.. Along the top edge of the phone you’ll find nothing of note, while on the left side there’s a SIM tray that supports two micro-SIM cards or one micro-SIM and one microSD card. On the right there’s a volume rocker and standby button that protrude just enough to be easy to use.. Finally, a micro-USB connector and 3.5mm headset jack sit alongside the microphone and speaker grilles, both of which are fairly large and attract quite a lot of dirt.. The 13-megapixel camera and dual-tone LED flash are found on the back of the phone and sit completely flush with the M5’s shell.. The most interesting feature – and one that you won’t often find on an ultra-budget phone – is the fingerprint reader/home button combination. I’ll talk more about both in the Software section.. The 5.2-inch LCD screen is perfectly serviceable, if unremarkable. It was bright enough to use outdoors on a sunny day, which is about all you can ask for at this price. The ambient light sensor did have a nasty habit of overcompensating indoor lighting, however, ramping up to maximum brightness even though I had the phone set to minimum brightness. This happened on several occasions .. In terms of colours, the screen is pretty drab, but for £100 it’s hard to ask for more. The 720 x 1,280-pixel resolution is fine for the size, but doesn’t hold a candle to devices offering a Full HD resolution.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

The M5 runs on Meizu’s own Flyme operating system, which sits atop Android 6.0.1. Initially, you’ll only be given access to Flyme’s own app store, which in all fairness contains a good number of the apps you’ll use reguarly, including YouTube and Facebook. However, after a few minutes of use I was prompted to install Google Play Services, which provided access to the regular Play Store.. The OS itself isn’t great, and it’s hard to completely eliminate its oddities by simply installing a new Android launcher. First, there’s no app drawer, which means you’ll have several homescreens chock-full of apps that you may not even use regularly.. Second, the notifications system is inconsistent. A particular annoyance is the way it handles third-party notifications. Apps such as Spotify, which have a constant notification icon when playing, show up as speech bubble notifications instead of the Spotify logo.. Downloading or updating an app? Speech bubble. It means I couldn’t trust the notifications bar and had to constantly check whether or not I had a message – which is a super-strange software feature.. The other slightly unusual feature is the home button, which is used for three different purposes.. First, via the fingerprint scanner, it can be used to unlock the phone. It’s a much slower scanner than those found on more expensive phones and it’s less reliable as well, but that didn’t stop me finding it a very useful feature.. However, you have to wake up the phone before using the scanner, so you can’t simply place your thumb on the button and wait. But on a positive note, there aren’t many phones at this price with fingerprint scanners.. In addition to taking you Home, the center button also functions as a Back button. To go Home you physically depress the button; to go back you simply tap it. This became familiar following a couple of days of use, but it never felt particularly comfortable.. Flyme OS also offers a form of multi-window support, but the screen’s resolution is too low and the phone too slow to properly take advantage of it. It also only works on certain apps, such as Facebook and Twitter.. To access this, and the Overview menu to see your running apps, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen. It’s far too sensitive for my liking; I found myself constantly swiping up from the bottom accidentally and being kicked out of whatever I was doing. I’d prefer it if Meizu used onscreen Back, Home and Overview buttons instead.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays..

I cover consumer tech in Asia. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. There's the flagship phone with top-of-the-line specs, the Pro 6. There's the mid-tier phone that is less powerful than the flagship but still more than enough for the average user, the MX6. There's the giant phablet with a 6-inch screen, the M3 Max. And now, the M5, a modest device that's meant to cater to the budget-conscious.. The Meizu M5 comes in a wide range of vibrant colors. It seems like every week, there's a new smartphone release. Heck, it seems like every week, there's a new Meizu release. Not even a month and half after I reviewed the Meizu M3 Max, I now have my hands on the Meizu M5. But to the credit of the Zhuhai-based phonemaker , at least each new. phone has a distinct identity that caters to a specific market -- unlike, say, Apple and its redundant products that all seem to. So for those who've lost count at home, here's a quick rundown on the major Meizu releases this year and its intended market:. The very last bit of the last sentence is saying something, considering all of Meizu's other phones already come at wonderfully low prices (the MX6 is still overall the best value smartphone on the market right now in my opinion).. But the M5's price really is something else. It's priced at just 699 rmb for the base model (2GB RAM, 16GB storage) and 899 for the 3GB RAM/32 GB storage) model. And it's not like the phones are cheaply constructed and severely underpowered. flagship Android level, but they're more than enough for certain age groups (think children or older auntie types) or crowds (people who just need a device to make calls, check emails and Facebook).. Even though the body, unlike other. Meizu phones, isn't made of metal but plastic, it's still a solidly constructed phone, with smooth edges/corners and zero camera hump. The 5.2-inch display is only 720p, so it's noticeably not as sharp as. Meizu's Pro 6, but it's not too noticeable on a smaller display, and colors are accurate and bright.. The display is not going to amaze you, but gets the job done. The 13-megapixel camera is completely flushed with the body. The phone just looks and feels very smooth.. The 13-megapixel, f/2.2 shooter in the back take solid photos, but it's the same problem with most non-Huawei Chinese phones: the photos look great during the day and can definitely hold its own against phones three times the price, but once the lights dim or the sun sets, the photo quality suffers a bit. There's a lot of noise in low-light photos. But I mean, this phone costs $100 -- you factor the price in and the camera is already better than it had any right to be.. Daytime shots come out strong, like just about every 2016 smartphone. Indoors, the photo comes out a bit warm, but details are still great.. The 5-megapixel front-facing lens is fine. (You might notice that I almost never mention the front-facing camera much in my reviews ... well I'm of the belief that dudes shouldn't take and post selfies, so it is what it is).. That Meizu managed to stuff a. 3070 mAh battery into a body this petite. (147.3 x 72.8 x 8.2 mm, aka 5.80 x 2.87 x 0.32 in) is another testament to the company's hardware manufacturing prowess .. On the performance front, the M5's MediaTek. is a mid-tier chip at best, and it shows when performing heavy tasks like editing videos by Video Editor Pro. But for basic usage -- Instagram, Whatsapp, surfing the web -- the phone has no problem. The Flyme 5.5 software here is the same one that's on earlier Meizu phones, and as I've gone on record saying before : I love the software experience. Meizu's mBack home button is highly intuitive and makes me look at the outdated home buttons on iPhones and Samsung phones with an eyeroll. I've explained in detail how mBack works before, but below is a video explaining how it works.. Since this is a modestly-spec'd phone that's made out of plastic, Meizu's made the M5 in various bolder colors. The review unit I have is a gold-ish color, which I think looks a bit generic, but the other colors -- blue, matte black and green -- look very nice. The matte black, in particular, looks great and should be offered as an option by every phonemaker. Seriously, phone companies, enough with these ridiculous gold or boring white phones. Gadgets look best in black -- ideally matte black, not glossy/shiny black like on the Galaxy phones.. The Meizu M5 isn't for power users and will underwhelm as a media consumption device and that's okay ( Meizu's got the M3 Max and the MX6 for that). The low price means this is an ideal phone to buy for your 8-year-old son (who breaks everything he touches) or 80-year-old grandpa (who loses everything he touches). It's also great to use as a secondary travel phone -- one that you wouldn't lose sleep over if it gets dinged up or stolen.. And then of course, there's the whole developing market (Ukraine, India) whose consumers may not have that much spending power. At just $100, the M5 should do well there..

Roydon Cerejo , 09 June 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The phone runs on a MediaTek MT6750 SoC and has 2GB of RAM. The bright display and good ergonomics aside, the rest isn't too exciting. The 16GB version of the M5 is priced at around Rs. Meizu M5 design and build Meizu M5 specifications and features Meizu M5 performance, camera, and battery life Verdict. As flagship smartphone technology trickles down to the lower rungs of the market, entry-level phones aren’t as basic as they used to be. Fingerprint sensors and speedy processors are now pretty easy to find in phones under the Rs. Meizu is back with a new budget smartphone called the Meizu M5. This device is available in two versions with different amounts of RAM and storage, both priced under Rs. In today’s test, we have the version with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, which is priced at roughly Rs. At this price, it competes with the 2GB version of. Xiaomi’s recently launched Redmi 4. ( Review ), which also retails at Rs. M5 fares in comparison and whether it offers good enough value to be recommended.. The Meizu M5 doesn’t have a very striking design but it still offers a comfortable grip thanks to its rounded edges and 2.5D curved-edge glass. The screen borders aren’t too thick, lending the phone a pleasing. There’s a notification LED near the front camera and the earpiece, which for some reason. is placed a bit asymmetrically above the display.. a physical home button below the screen with a fingerprint sensor built in. There aren’t any navigation buttons here, as Meizu has its own navigation scheme. A single touch of the home button takes you a step back, and the app switcher is accessed with a swipe up. gesture from the bottom of the display. There’s no option to enable onscreen buttons. With no tutorial in place to show you how to actually use this navigation method, it takes some figuring it out when you first set the phone. The volume and power buttons are placed on the right, and they're easy to use. The hybrid dual-SIM tray is placed on the left. The second SIM slot can accommodate a microSD card of up to 128GB if needed. Meizu claims that the M5 has an anodised metal frame inside but it isn't visible, as the sides and back are covered by plastic. Build quality of the Meizu M5. is decent, and we didn’t encounter much flex when using this phone, though a metal build would have been nice.. The rear camera sits flush with the rest of the body. At the bottom, we have a Micro-USB port, speaker grille and headphones socket. The 5.2-inch display of the Meizu M5. that doesn’t look too bad on a screen this size, but the colours are a bit dull. Touch response and viewing angles are decent, and the phone has a high maximum brightness level. which makes it easy to use even under direct sunlight. In the box, you get a standard Micro-USB cable and charger.. The fingerprint sensor works but it’s not the most accurate one we’ve used. Besides unlocking the phone, you can use it for locking apps, accessing a secure folder for private files called 'Vault', and activating a guest mode. Overall, the Meizu M5 has a good feel to it even though it doesn’t look particularly striking. The fit and finish of the plastics is decent and ergonomics are nice.. Under the plastic shell is an octa-core. MediaTek MT6750 SoC, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of storage. Meizu also sells a version of this phone with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage at Rs. Benchmark performance is pretty average, and we got 40,042 points in AnTuTu and 20fps in GFXbench.. Other specifications include dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, USB-OTG, and GPS. There’s no FM radio, which might be sore point for some. The phone also lacks a gyroscope sensor. Meizu M5 supports 4G networks but according to Meizu, the phone does not support VoLTE. On the Jio network, we had to manually enter the APN for cellular data to work, but calls still didn't go through.. The Meizu M5 runs on Meizu’s Flyme OS 5, which is based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. However, the phone doesn’t seem to have received any recent security patches from Google as the last update is from October 2016. We tried reaching out to Meizu for clarity on this and for any commitment to future Android updates, but didn't get any conclusive response.. The custom navigation method takes some getting used to since there’s no way to enable onscreen navigation buttons. There are a bunch of customisable gestures to choose from and a feature called SmartTouch, which is like AssistiveTouch on the iPhone. Our unit didn’t have the Google Play Store preinstalled so we had to add it manually using the Hot Apps app.. The single-layered interface on the Meizu M5. runs smoothly for the most part. The Themes app lets you change the look of the phone, although we didn’t find anything of real interest here. The Security app has tools for cleaning up junk files,. data usage and blocking contacts, and even a virus scanner, all in one place. The Toolbox app has features like a flashlight, mirror, compass, level, ruler and magnifier. The Meizu M5 also has its own app store, which is a bit redundant if you have the Play Store.. The Meizu M5 performs smoothly when you first set it up but after a few days of normal usage, we noticed slight lag when scrolling through webpages and switching between apps. It isn't consistent but it’s definitely noticeable with daily usage. Another peculiar thing we came across was that when we signed in with our Gmail account, the standard security alert told us that we've signed in from a. Leagoo is another Chinese smartphone manufacturer, but once again, we couldn't get any satisfying explanation for this from Meizu.. We found that the Meizu M5 gets a bit. warm when watching videos, including those streamed from YouTube.. Video playback is restricted to 1080p although we had no trouble playing our high-bitrate video files. FLAC audio is also supported with the stock music player, which is nicely designed. However, the built-in speaker is weak, which makes it hard to hear your media files clearly. Things are better with headphones but there isn’t any audio enhancement or equaliser app. Tap to see full-sized Meizu M5 camera samples. The cameras on the Meizu M5 are what you’d expect from a smartphone in this segment. They capture acceptable photos during the day but really struggle in low light. The rear camera has a 13-megapixel sensor, with a f/2.2 aperture and PDAF. Thanks to the latter, focusing is fairly quick under adequate lighting. The sensor isn’t able to capture good details in landscapes or macro shots, no. Light metering isn’t the best either, as whites tend to bloom easily.. In low-light, there’s lots of compression artifacting and colour reproduction is poor. The front 5-megapixel camera on the Meizu M5. also does a passable job under good lighting but suffers in low-light. The camera app on the other hand is well designed, with toggle switches for the timer and flash, effects on the left and shooting modes and the shutter button on the right. Shooting modes include panorama, GIF and manual. Once again, the back of the phone ran pretty warm when we used the camera app.. The 3070mAh battery on the Meizu M5. delivered 10 hours and 17 minutes of runtime in our HD video loop test, which isn’t bad. However, during actual usage, we noticed big dips in battery life when. using the camera or gaming for a bit. There’s also no fast charging support, so charging it fully is a long wait. The bundled 10W power adapter is compact and easy to carry.. The Meizu M5 starts at roughly Rs. 7,000, for the 16GB model we tested, but the price varies a bit across online stores. The 32GB version is priced at Rs. 9,499 after receiving a recent price cut. 7,000 is generally considered a good price for a smartphone with this feature set, its overall performance still puts it behind the Xiaomi Redmi 4.. The Meizu M5 could have been a good budget contender but it has too many shortcomings, like the lack of FM radio and VoLTE, average camera and system performance, and the fact that the back of the phone runs warm very often. We're also uncertain that this phone will receive necessary software and security updates. With better options available, we recommend giving this one a miss..

Highlight – Great features without breaking the bank. December 15, 2016 - Written By Nick Sutrich. Meizu is back for another round with its latest budget minded smartphone, the Meizu M5. Skipping the M4 moniker altogether, Meizu has followed up the M3, which it released this past Spring, with the interestingly named M5, a phone sporting a polycarbonate body and an incredibly low price tag. While the numbers are certainly higher, it’s visually impossible to distinguish the M5 from the M3 released earlier this year. Meizu has also increased the price just a bit from that device, from 599 Yuan for the M3 at launch to the 699 Yuan for the M5 at launch. Is the upgrade here worth the price adjustment, or should you stick with what Meizu already has on the market? Let’s take a look.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. The spec list is pretty similar to Meizu’s previously released M3, however it does differentiate on a couple of levels. First up is a larger 5.2-inch 720p screen, as well as a bigger 3,070mAh non-removable battery under the hood. Meizu is also sporting a new camera sensor on the M5, and while it retains the same 13-megapixel resolution and f/2.2 lens of the M3, it features faster PDAF autofocus than the previous generation did. On the front you’ll find the same 5-megapixel camera with f/2.0 lens above the display, as well as the mBack physical button below the display. Running the show is a MediaTek. MT6750 octa-core processor clocked at 1.5GHZ, as well as a Mali-T860 GPU.. The Meizu M5 ships in multiple colors including. Blue, Champagne Gold, Matte Black, Mint Green and White. You’ll find a single microUSB port, single speaker and a 3.5mm audio jack on the bottom of the device. The Meizu M5 weighs in at an incredibly light 138 grams, and its polycarbonate body measures up at 147.3mm high, 72.8mm wide and 8.2mm thin. Our review unit came with 16GB internal storage and 2GB RAM, which retails for 699 Yuan (~$101 USD). Meizu also makes a model with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage for 899 Yuan (~$130 USD). Folks needing extra storage will be happy with the microSD card support here, and that same microSD card slot doubles as a second nano-SIM card slot for folks that need two SIM cards instead.. For $100 it’s not hard to understand why only the bare essentials are included. You’re getting a phone with a SIM tray eject tool, warranty guide, USB Type-A to microUSB cable, and a 5v/2a wall charger. That’s about it, nothing flashy or excessive in this minimalist packaging.. The IPS LCD panel on the Meizu M5 is about as average as you’ll find, sporting the usual LCD positives and negatives. Per IPS standards viewing angles are excellent and exhibit only a bit of dimming, however you will notice the backlight at certain angles more than others, making blacks even more gray than usual. Subsequently black levels on the panel are OK at best, looking darker the dimmer you set the backlight, and significantly more gray as the backlight intensity increases. Color balance is pretty good, with a slight hue towards to cool side of the spectrum. You can adjust the color temperature of the panel a bit in display settings, but it never quite looks natural no matter where it’s at on the slider.. The 720p resolution is low for this size of a panel, coming in at 282 pixels-per-inch, or around 50 pixels-per-inch lower than what’s considered a “retina” display. This means seeing pixels is easy and images will look soft no matter what you do, and 720p is pretty low resolution at this point in 2016 as well, even for a less expensive phone. Refresh rate of the pixels is pretty slow too, and you’ll regularly find trailing and ghosting when scrolling around on the screen, especially on higher contrast points like dark icons on a light background. Brightness levels are at least quite good, and range from very dim in a dark room, to very bright in sunlight. It’s not the brightest panel around but you shouldn’t have to do much to see it in direct sun, outside of blocking the rays with your hand at the worst. Lastly Meizu includes an automatic “eye protect” mode, which will filter out blue light in the evenings to help you sleep better if you’re regularly on your phone til the very end of the day.. 699Yuan/$100USD is incredibly cheap for any phone, and it would be surprising to see good specs with a. Meizu has chosen to keep the polycarbonate build of the M3 intact on the M5, including what appears to be an identical design to that phone. The M5 is unbelievably light and tends to feel a bit cheap when holding it, but there’s only a slight give to the plastic when pressing it in on the back. Outside of this the build feels quite nice and matches what’s expected from Meizu’s design studio, not to mention that it’s quite difficult to tell this apart from an iPhone’s general design language. on all edges towards the polycarbonate body and gives it a higher quality look and feel than straight glass would. Meizu’s new colors are striking and look great against the black glass panel on the front.. On the right side you’ll find the power button and volume rocker, both plastic buttons, while the left side holds the SIM/microSD card tray. Nothing is at the top, instead all ports are at the bottom including the 3.5mm audio jack, microphone, microUSB port and the single speaker. The corners and edges of the back are perfectly rounded and feel really nice in the hand, with no sharp corners to irritate hands when holding it in any position. On the back you’ll find the round camera lens with dual-LED flash below it, and the Meizu logo just below that. As has been the case with any Meizu phone in the past few years, you’ll see the multi-function mBack button below the display on the front. This button serves as a physical home button, capacitive touch back button as well as a fingerprint scanner.. 2GB of RAM is becoming fairly paltry for Android phones in general, even for 720p screens. Even still memory management should be better than it is on the M5, at least on the 2GB version we have for the review. I found that apps would regularly have to reload, even if you had just switched away from them for a second or two. Some apps don’t face this issue, but more often than not I would have to wait an extra 2-3 seconds for the app to reload, and depending on the app I might not even be back to where I left off. For instance Google Play Music goes back to the home screen when reloading, meaning whatever album I was searching for probably won’t be on the screen after switching away from it. This doesn’t cause issues with background music play or anything like that, but it makes navigating on the phone slower. The 3GB model of the M5 likely has better performance in this department, although we can’t vouch for that particular unit.. Overall performance of the OS was pretty good, however there was a bit of hitching and stutter that you won’t find on the newer MediaTek processing packages. Why Meizu chose to stick with an older MT6750 instead of putting a newer Helio P10 processor in here is a bit of a mystery, aside from possible pricing reasons, but it certainly makes the phone feel older than something that was announced at the end of October 2016. Still it’s not likely to make anyone mad, as it performs well enough to get the job done and certainly works better than $100 phones from a year or two ago to say the least. Impressively enough these performance issues do not carry over to 3D gaming, instead it feels like a completely different phone when gaming. Even the most intense games on the Google Play Store resulted in buttery smooth performance, with nary a hitch or long loading point. This is a great mobile gaming device without a doubt, even with the lower resolution.. As a result of using an older, low-power SoC, you’ll find benchmarks for the Meizu M5 to be quite low to say the least. Our normal 3DMark tests wouldn’t run, so see the rest benchmarks we were able to run on the phone below.. LTE comes standard with almost every phone shipped nowadays, and the Meizu M5 is no exception if you’re a resident of China. Folks International to China probably won’t see the same network connectivity though, although you may find the phone could support LTE in your own country. Here in the US the phone only works on 3G HSPA+ networks and below, such as T-Mobile, AT&T or one of its many MVNOs like Cricket or Straight Talk. No NFC is included here, so you won’t be making any mobile payments with the Meizu M5 despite having a fingerprint reader. Bluetooth v4.0 is supported, and dual-band 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz WiFi up to 802.11n speeds are supported.. In Flyme 5.2, based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, Meizu introduced some adjustments to Google’s new Doze method of saving battery. configuration for the scheduled wakeup mode means that apps are only allowed to request information during certain intervals, an effort to keep apps from waking up too often and draining your battery. This works far better than Xiaomi or Huawei’s implementations for comparison, but still keeps some apps from delivering timely notifications. There were times where I went 10 minutes or so without receiving a notification, only to realize it was delivered a few minutes late. What’s improved here over other OEM’s implementations is that I actually received all the notifications I should have, even if they were delayed. Even still I opted to turn this feature off, as it didn’t appear to save much battery life and instead gave me notifications on time, every time.. Battery life as a whole is good for the phone, lasting all day without any issues. Meizu’s battery usage graph works differently from other OEMs, and as such it’s difficult to see how much screen on time is actually achievable during a single day, however I never had a day where I needed to top up the battery regardless of heavy usage. Quick charging works via the included adapter in the box, but you’ll need to make sure to use this wall charger to get the quick charge effect as the phone has. very specific voltage requirements to qualify for quick charging.. Sound output via the 3.5mm audio jack on the bottom is excellent overall, and while it’s not the highest quality you’ll find among smartphones, it’s difficult to dock Meizu much simply because of the price of this phone. Phones in this price range used to have pretty awful sound output, but Meizu is using some good DACs here as well as some great balance in software. There’s also a built-in software equalizer that helps balance things out further if you need it, be it listening on headphones or through a more powerful stereo system. Output via the speaker on the bottom is pretty lousy though, and you’ll find that the audio is incredibly flat, not loud enough. This one is only good for watching the occasional YouTube video or playing simple games, definitely not for listening to. that needs better quality to be enjoyed.. The beauty of a well thought out Android skin like Flyme is that users who don’t want to, or can’t afford to buy the most expensive phones out there, can still enjoy more premium-minded features. All the same features you’ll find on the more expensive Meizu handsets are here, and Meizu even ships this phone with Flyme 5.2.10.0, which runs atop Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Flyme 6 may be on the horizon, but for now this is the latest version available and even includes the October security patch to boot, unlike some of Meizu’s other phones. The latest Flyme features like scheduled eye protection, multi-tasking via the card-like interface instead of icons, floating icons instead of bottom bars and more. Meizu has been updating their UI consistently with new features for a while now, and it thankfully only seems to build upon those instead of taking them away or replacing them.. Meizu includes quite a few little tools and apps, and it all starts with the app recommendation panel. Upon first setup of the phone you’ll be greeted with this screen before you get to the home screen for the first time. Meizu regularly updates this list of apps to give you recommendations for what’s hot and worth downloading, and I found that it recommended a good handful that I regularly use right out of the box. Since this phone has full Play Store integration, all of these apps link to their respective Play Store listings, and there’s no fiddling with a 3rd party app store outside of China. Meizu also includes a number of tools in the “toolbox” app including flashlight, mirror, level. Meizu’s Security Center app is probably the single most useful place on the entire phone when you first start it up, as it contains powerful tools for managing data use, battery management, harassment blocking and more. Included in this section you’ll find a general junk cleaner and “accelerator,” data management for managing Wifi and Cell data usage, harassment blocking for keeping those annoying numbers from calling or texting, permissions management for everything from apps that auto-start to individual app permissions, file management, virus scanning and plenty of different battery modes and options. All of these work incredibly well, and while things like “accelerating” your phone by emptying RAM are useless and generally do more harm to battery life than good, they are still things that many users like and don’t have to download extra apps to get.. It’s been some time since Meizu changed their camera software at all, and what you’ll find here is generally the same software Meizu has included on its phones for a while now. Modes can be changed via a dedicated button next to the shutter, and 9 different modes are included with the phone. There’s no quick record button in photo mode to quickly take a recording without having to switch modes,. but you will be able to take pictures while recording. Mode switching can take some time though depending on which mode you’re switching to, and generally the method of switching between important modes like photo and video is incredibly tedious and takes far too long. There should be a way to switch quickly between these two most used modes, and that’s probably the biggest detriment to the software in general.. What’s also not so great is having to manually switch to HDR mode, something that should be automatic, or at least a quick toggle button on the main interface. Hiding this mode means most users will probably never remember to switch to it. Surprisingly a manual mode is included here, something that’s usually only reserved for far more expensive phones, and in general is a great way to adjust properties of the camera to achieve better results. This is particularly true in lower lighting conditions, where you may want to focus on spots that the auto focus can’t quite get, or adjust the ISO or shutter speed to levels that the auto mode doesn’t always want to go. In general this is a great manual mode and it’s impressive to see it included on a phone in this price range.. Meizu’s camera software is certainly fast, and will rival even far more expensive phones in its speed and performance. Launching in under 2 seconds from the lock screen. launch the camera quickly using a customizable gesture in the settings, something that keeps the camera launching fast every time without having to first turn on the screen. Focusing happens in about 1 second from moving the camera, and in general the phase detection auto focus here does an excellent job of focusing on the right subject every time. Picture taking speed is instant, and there’s no shutter lag or processing time to wait for. In general this is a fast, fantastic picture taking experience.. Quality really shines over other phones in this price range too, and. you’re likely to find that in good lighting this more than does the job. Comparing to most phones in this price range, this sensor has truly excellent dynamic range, even with HDR disabled. It’s certainly not going to rival larger or better sensors like ones in the Google Pixel or Galaxy S7, but this phone also costs 1/6th of the price of those devices, and should be gauged as such. What’s most important here is that the phone pulls the right exposure levels out for the scene at hand, and I never found a time where the phone would make the. foreground overly dark to compensate for a bright sky or other bright back-lighting, and so on and so forth.. Lower light shots definitely suffer from the sensor quality though, and usually come out soft and lacking detail. What’s impressive here though is that this sensor doesn’t seem to fall victim to. many of the normal issues we see on cheaper sensors in low light. There’s no weird discoloration of the scene, no strange artifacts from overly high ISO, and generally the picture is clean. There were times when the shutter speed was too high for a hand-held shot and should have been faster, and this was the only real place Meizu could likely improve upon the experience. 1/20th of a second is a reasonable amount of time to hold open for lower light shots, yet these photos still turned out blurry more often than not. Some electronic image stabilization would definitely help cure this.. The front-facing camera is decent but doesn’t go out of its way to do much in the way of a quality, high resolution experience. Still it’s decent enough for social media posts and performs well enough in low light, even though the shutter constantly seems to be held open too long. This means ever so slightly blurry images in mid to low lighting, but again you’d probably not notice much or care if posting to social media. Video mode is great overall, but the phone defaults to 480p 4:3 video for both the front and back cameras. For 480p video this actually looks quite good, but it’s peculiar that, at the end of 2016, any OEM would have defaults for less than 1080p quality on a device that supports it, especially going all the way back down to SD quality out of the box. This is a silly setting and certainly needs to change, but once you move it up to 1080p the sensor once again shines over the rest in this price range. There’s no excessive wobbling of video when moving, and again dynamic range is excellent, colors and white balance are accurate, and overall video on this phone looks great. Check out the full gallery below.. Looks more expensive than it is. Great sound output via 3.5mm audio jack. in North America (will work in other parts of the world, however). SoC could be better, being priced so low means Meizu only has so many options for what it packs in the M5. Even with the performance hitches and occasional slow loading of apps that we saw, the Meizu M5 performs admirably at this price range, and shows that Meizu knows how to balance these phones to cut corners in places that don’t matter as much. design that looks nearly identical to Meizu’s other phones, be that positive or negative for you, and a build that’s quality even though it retains the plastic materials of yesteryear, the Meizu M5 is really a great choice for those on an ultra-tight budget that are looking to get all the features they want and aren’t picky about blazing every day performance. With a well above-average camera for this price range, great audio out and excellent performance in gaming,. Download: Contributions Gets A Shortcut In Google Maps Beta.
