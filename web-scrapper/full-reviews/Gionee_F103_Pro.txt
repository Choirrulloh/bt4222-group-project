I have bought this phone in the month of January and now it is almost 2 and a half month. When I bought this phone from OnlyMobiles.Com, I was little bit sceptical since my all purchases were always from Flipkart. Anyways, OnlyMobiles team have ensured timely delivery. I will list down top reasons, why you should buy Gionee F103 Pro. (01) good build quality - the phone actually makes a style statement. With metal frame and strong polycarbonate body (with good finish) is a stunner. I have dropped this phone many times but still there is no major dent happened. The phone do not have any sharp corners and easy to carry whole day in pocket. (02) good display - the display is 2.5D curved glass and with dragontrail protection. no one provides perfect glass display but this dragontrail protection ensures that we do not see scratches on the display. The display is HD IPS and with wide viewing angle. The display is adaptive and gets automatically adjusted with the outdoor or indoor visibility. (03) Though the phone is 5.0 Inches - you can use it very easily with just one hand. This is very helpful if you have bad habit like me to check the phone even when you are driving. (04) Good Rear Camera - the rear camera is of 13MP which is very nice. The background blur effect is great. Pictures which we take are with great details as well. (05) Display flash - the feature which we find only in high end smartphones - we are getting in Gionee F103 Pro. The display doubles as front camera selfie flash which helps to take good pictures in low light conditions. (06) Performance of Gionee F103 is really superb. By vinay ganguly on 27 April 2017. Got gionee f103 pro at lowest price on only mobiles site. The review on youtube was pretty good and the specs were exactly what i wanted so i got this one. gionee f103 pro is light weight phone with good grip.

Digit Mobile Phones Gionee Gionee F103 Pro Gionee F103 Pro Review. Published Date | Last Updated. Our Verdict Gionee F103 Pro: Detailed Review. Gionee F103 Pro Price in India. 7299/- Buy Now Set Price Drop Alert. The Gionee F103 Pro looks good but that is the only area where it excels. Offering a sub-par display, a mediocre camera and a poor battery life, the Gionee F103 Pro, lacks the ingredients to become a successful budget smartphone. The phone’s best feature is its design but what is the point of a good looking smartphone if it is dead before the evening.. CONS Reflective, dim display Noisy camera images sub-par battery life. Please enter your email to be informed whenever the price of this product reaches your Target Price. Subscribe here to further receive Related Stories, Product Reviews, Launches & Best Deals. Gionee F103 Pro is currently available at the best price of: ₹7,299. Chinese smartphone maker Gionee has been focussing its efforts on the Marathon series, pushing the benefits of their long battery life. But that’s not all Gionee has to offer. In the past, the company has been known for some of its ultra slim smartphones, while it has also had flagship class phones in the country. The Gionee F103 Pro, though, falls in none of those categories. It’s neither an ultra-slim smartphone, not one that has hours and hours of battery life. It’s a budget device, and an upgrade to the earlier F103 smartphone. Gionee has bumped up the RAM on the F103, and added a 13MP camera on the back. But can this device take on the likes of the LeEco Le 2 and Xiaomi Redmi Note 3? Let’s find out.. Build and Design: Nothing much has changed. The Gionee F103 Pro is a good looking device, just like the F103. The phone features a very elegant candybar design, which looks and feels premium. There is a laminated glass up front, metal rails run along the side and the back is removable. It also has a removable plastic back cover, but the excellent paint job and the sandblasted finish give the back a metallic feel. The back is also slightly curved, which, combined with the chamfered edges and the 5-inch form factor makes the Gionee F103 Pro very ergonomic. We should also add that the three navigation keys that lie below the display work well, but are non-illuminated and may take some getting used to.. Display and UI: Could have been better. The quality of displays on budget smartphones have improved over time and the display on the F103 Pro does a decent job as well, but its shortcomings outweigh its strengths. The display has good viewing angles, colour accuracy and touch response. However, the sunlight legibility is poor and even at full brightness, the display seems a little dull. The maximum brightness we got was around 570 lux, which is pretty dim. On top of that, the 5-inch display has a resolution of 720p only, which in our opinion is too 2014.. While the display seems dull, same can’t said about Amigo UI. The UI here is quite iOS like, with pull up from bottom quick toggles and the non-availability of an app drawer. The UI also adds an extra layer of customisation to the Android operating system, including an app called Chameleon Themes.With this app, you can choose colours from your surroundings and the software will make a theme out of it. There are other cosmetic changes, but the UI is more or less similar to what you’ll get from other Chinese phone manufacturers. Comparing the latest version of this UI with previous versions, we noticed that Gionee has simplified the UI overall.. Performance: Well optimised but still miles to go. Powered by a MediaTek MT6735 SoC, the Gionee F103 Pro is a not the best performer out there but Gionee has managed to get the most out of this one-year-old processor. The quad-core 1.3GHz SoC, combined with 3GB of RAM, felt relatively smooth. Although, opening multiple apps back to back can make the phone stutter. The gaming experience isn’t the best either, but only those who are big on mobile gaming will complain. We tried games like Injustice: Gods Among Us and found that while all popular games work, occasional stutters and lags creep in after 15 minutes of gaming. Also, the phone heats up quite easily while gaming and during video capture. We recorded over 40 degree celsius temperatures at times.. The F103 Pro is a respectable performer, except that we’re not looking for respectable performers any more. The F103 Pro does pale against its competition.. Further, there is nothing to complain about the call quality and on the reception front, but the sound quality isn’t good. Audio via headphones is on the bassy side and thus overpowers everything else.. The 13MP rear camera on the Gionee F103 Pro is kind of a mixed bag. Images taken during the daytime offer good dynamic range and decent depth. However, the colours seem a little washed out and there is noise across the image. Image quality further deteriorates in low light and the processing time also increases.. The front facing camera however, does a decent job and is good enough for quick selfies. Gionee has also added a feature in the camera software that turns up the brightness of the display to generate brighter selfies. It’s Gionee’s take on Apple’s Retina flash, and it works, though, not without noise... The Gionee F103 Pro has the same 2400mAh battery, as on the original F103. In day to day use, we found that the small battery pack is just not capable enough to last through the day. Even if you aren’t a gamer, and just use your smartphone for simpler tasks such as Whatsapp, Facebook, browsing, Youtube or music streaming, you would need a charger by evening. Gaming on the phone kills the battery easily.. Overall, the Gionee F103 Pro is a half hearted effort to make a budget smartphone. It starts well, with the design and build, offers respectable performance as well, but the battery life is disappointing. Further, the higher price tag, puts it in the crosshairs of phones like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 and LeEco Le 2. To be fair, these two phones have simply decimated everything in the past six months in the sub-15K smartphone segment, and the Gionee F103 Pro is just another victim. Even if you want a smaller phone, that looks good, the Xiaomi Mi 4i is a better choice.. Gionee F103 Pro (Gold, 16 GB)(3.... Gionee F103 Pro. Moto C Plus (Pearl White, 16....

Information about some specific features related to the SIM card(s) of the device.. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) was developed to replace the analog cellular network (1G), therefore it is referred to as a 2G mobile network. It has been improved with the addition of General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and later via the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology.. W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) is an air interface used by 3G mobile networks. It is one of the three different UMTS interfaces together with the TD-SCDMA and the TD-CDMA. The standard provides faster data transfer speeds and allows more users to connect to the network simultaneously.. LTE is deemed to be the fourth generation (4G) of mobile communications technology. It has been developed by the 3GPP based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies in order to increase the speed and capacity of wireless data networks. A further development of the technology is called LTE Advanced.. There are several network technologies that enhance the performance of mobile networks mainly by increased data bandwidth. Information about the communication technologies supported by the device and their respective uplink and downlink bandwidth.. Information about the operating system used by the device as well as its version.. The SoC integrates different hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, peripherals, interfaces, etc., as well as software for their functioning.. Information about the process technology used in manufacturing the chip. The value in nanometers represents half the distance between elements that make up the CPU.. CPU is the Central Processing Unit or the processor of a mobile device. Its main function is to interpret and execute instructions contained in software applications.. The CPU bits are determined by the bit-size of the processor registers, address buses and data buses. 64-bit CPUs provide better performance than 32-bit ones, which on their part perform better than 16-bit processors.. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a set of commands used by the software to manage the CPU's work. Information about the set of instructions the processor can execute.. The cache memory is used by the processor in order to shorten the time needed to access data and instructions that a frequently used. The L1 (level 1) cache memory has a small volume, but operates faster than the RAM and the rest cache memory levels. If the processor does not find the data needed in L1, it continues to look for it in the L2 cache memory. In some processors the search in L1 and L2 is simultaneous.. The L2 (level 2) cache memory is slower than L1, but has a larger capacity, instead, which allows it to cache more data. Just like L1, it is much faster than the system memory (RAM). If the CPU does not find the data needed in L2, it proceeds to look for them in the L3 cache memory (if there is such) or in the RAM.. A CPU core is the processor unit, which executes software instructions. Presently, besides single-core processors, there are dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core and so on multi-core processors. They increase the performance of the device allowing the execution of multiple instructions in parallel.. The frequency of the processor describes its clock rate in cycles per second. It is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. GPU is a graphical processing unit, which handles computation for 2D/3D graphics applications. In mobile devices GPU is usually utilized by games, UI, video playback, etc. GPU can also perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU.. Similar to the CPU, the GPU consists of processing units called cores. They handle the computation of graphics in various applications.. The frequency is the clock rate of the graphic processor (GPU), which is measured in Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz).. RAM (Random-Access Memory) is used by the operating system and all installed applications. Data in the RAM is lost after the device is turned off or restarted.. Information about the type of RAM used by the device.. Information about the number of RAM channels integrated in the SoC. More channels mean higher data transfer rates.. RAM frequency relates directly to the rate of reading/writing from/in the RAM memory.. Information about the capacity of the built-in storage of the device. Sometimes one and the same model may is offered in variants with different internal storage capacity.. The various types of memory cards are characterized by different sizes and capacity. Information about the supported types of memory cards.. One of the main characteristics of the display is its type/technology, on which depends its performance.. In mobile devices display size is represented by the length of its diagonal measured in inches.. The ratio between the long and the short side of the display. The display resolution shows the number of pixels on the horizontal and vertical side of the screen. The higher the resolution is, the greater the detail of the displayed content.. Information about the number of pixels per centimeter (ppcm) or per inch (ppi) of the display. The higher the pixel density, the more detailed and clearer is the information displayed on the screen..
