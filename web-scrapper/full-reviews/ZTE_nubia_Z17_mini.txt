Review talking about - Read all Great camera Reviews. BASED ON 94 RATING(S). 03 Oct 2017 By 91mobiles Customer On 91mobiles.com. the camera of this phone is outstanding i love it but no any update for software still the old once. 16 Jul 2017 By Amazon User On amazon.in. After more than fifteen days of use, I've started doubting my decision to spend 20000 for this phone. The phone feels great in hands. The main camera is great for outdoor and in natural lighting but in low and artificial lighting it struggles a lot. Sound output through speaker and headphones is amazing. The major problem is the battery. I charge it twice a day on continuous usage. The battery lasts for about 24 hours on normal usage. The maximum screen-on time was about 8 hours..with off course no gaming. It takes almost 2 hours to charge completely. Nubia needs to work on the software. After fifteen days, some apps froze for a minute or two. Even if it has 4GB of ram, the phone struggles to keep the apps in memory. There are some lags here and there and they are really annoying. Also, very less accessories available at Amazon.in.My Rating:Look & Feel: 10/10Camera: 8/10Display: 9/10Sound: 9/10Battery:7/10Software: 8/10Connectivity: 10/10.

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. ZTE nubia Z17 mini give its own take on dual cameras. JC Torres - Apr 9, 2017. You know that dual cameras are the next big thing when even “budget friendly” smartphones start sporting two cameras on their backs. And decent ones at that! ZTE sub-brand nubia has just announced the nubia Z17 mini and while its specs and design might not completely impress, for its price you are promised an acceptable, though perhaps not superb, twin 13 megapixel shooters of your own in the tradition of Huawei and Apple.. There are different, or at least two, ways to do dual cameras. The one popularized by Huawei is to have one regular RGB sensor paired with a monochrome sensor, the latter tasked with gathering more contrast and depth data. The nubia Z17 mini uses this implementation as well with one slight difference. Huawei’s dual cameras, like many of its kind, are usually uneven. One sensor has more megapixels than the other, usually the monochrome one.. In ZTE’s case, however, both have 13 megapixel f/2.2 sensors. The nubia Z17 mini’s front camera is no slouch either, with a larger 16 megapixel sensor and an equally larger f/2.0 aperture. So if the dual cameras weren’t enough for your photography taste buds, the obviously selfie-oriented front camera might be.. The rest of the nubia Z17 mini’s specs, however, are somewhat less impressive. It’s a midrange smartphone through and through, though with a slightly higher caliber. There are two configurations, one with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor with 4 GB of RAM and another with a Snapdragon 653 with 6 GB of RAM. In both configurations, there is 64 GB of expandable storage and a 5.2-inch 1920×1080 screen.. ZTE is reportedly eying a launch of the nubia Z17 mini in Europe and India, and perhaps even in the US in the foreseeable future. No price details for international markets have been confirmed yet, but in China, the Z17 mini is going for 1,699 CNY ($250) and 1,999 CNY ($290) for the 4 GB and 6 GB RAM models, respectively..
