Lenovo K8 Note first impressions: Doesn’t really let you miss the K7 Note. Instead of introducing the K7 Note, Lenovo skipped right to the K8 Note in India. So, is this phone two generations superior to the predecessor? Let’s find out. Updated: Aug 11, 2017 12:49 IST. The Lenovo K8 Note seems to have achieved the right balance between software and hardware.. I never really had any qualms about custom user interfaces (UIs) running atop Android, but I do know many who don’t care for them. And, to be fair, not all companies have succeeded in pulling off fluid UIs – instead delivering phones that slow down with time.. Micromax probably figured this out long ago with handsets produced under its YU sub-brand. Lenovo is the latest smartphone company to wise up, officially bidding adieu to its Vibe UI and moving towards stock Android.. The first smartphone coming under the manufacturer’s new strategy is the Lenovo K8 Note, launched in India on Wednesday. The company has also promised regular updates for the smartphone – something Nokia has been highlighting for its new devices.. But stock Android cannot be the sole USP of a smartphone, at least not in 2017. In my opinion, a balance of software and hardware – coupled with an appropriate price point – are essential for any smartphone to succeed. I have spent a brief time with the Lenovo K8 Note, and here are my first impressions.. At the very first glance, the Lenovo K8 Note seems like any other smartphone in the sub-Rs 15,000 category (not counting the dual-rear camera setup on the back panel). The face of the smartphone is dominated by the display, with a front camera and flash light on top and capacitive touch navigation buttons at the bottom. The volume and power buttons are located on the right edge, and the left houses SIM and microSD slots along with a dedicated music key. While the base features a microUSB port, there is a 3.5mm audio port on top.. Even though the Lenovo K8 Note is a 5.5-inch smartphone, it feels fairly large on the palm. But then, this is probably because I am used to handling the smaller iPhone 6. At 180 grams, the smartphone is quite heavy.. I have used quite a few Lenovo phones in the past, and as far I can see, the Vibe UI undergone significant improvement over the years. I really liked the interface on the K5 Note, launched in August last year. But stock Android is a different experience altogether (in a good way). The smartphone runs smoothly on the 7.1.1 Nougat. As far as customisations go, the Lenovo K8 Note come with TheaterMax technology, which can be launched by long-pressing the power button on the side. It comes preloaded with a slew of Microsoft apps such as Outlook, Skype, PowerPoint and Word – all of which are uninstallable.. The K8 Note uses a 64-bit 2.3GHz MediaTek deca-core Helio X23 processor. While I did not spend enough time with the phone to give you my take on its performance, I do hope it is good enough to take on the Snapdragon 625 processor that powers the top-selling Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. Lenovo claims that Helio X23 can beat the Snapdragon 625, Helio P20 and Snapdragon 430 processors hands down. I was satisfied with the UI during the brief period I spent with the phone, but do wait for our final-verdict review to know more.. The dual-rear camera is another highlight to look out for. The K8 Note comes with a 13-megapixel primary sensor and a 5-megapixel depth sensor, with dual LED flash. It is good to see budget smartphones joining the likes of Honor 6X on the dual-rear camera bandwagon.. That being said, I did struggle to take DSLR-like “Bokeh-effect” images. I will probably need more time with the K8 Note to capture bokeh images like a pro. The camera UI is fairly simple. To take depth-of-the-field photographs, tap the icon on the extreme top-right and select depth-sensing. Images, even taken in HDR mode, are processed in a jiffy.. The Lenovo K8 Note seems to have achieved the right balance between software and hardware. And with a price tag starting at Rs 12,999, the Lenovo K8 Note does raise my expectations.. So, can it help Lenovo dent Xiaomi’s supremacy in the budget category? We’ll know that soon enough. Until then, stay tuned for our detailed review..

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 4.0 out of 5 stars Ignore low scores. Size: 4 GB | Colour: Venom Black | Verified Purchase. I see not many problems as have been described in the reviews. Which phone in that price range works as an i-phone ? The phone is quite handy, fast and battery is not that bad. One way to stop drainage of power is by disabling the auto-brightness feature and turning off wi-fi or net when not in use. Android apps are fine and neatly working. Sound is good but have to by a good quality headphone to enjoy the surround sound. I would like to add that search for buying a budget phone is really like a bengali proverb : bansh bone dom kana, which means, bamboo workmen become blind inside a banboo forest while choosing for the best quality bamboo to cut for their craft works. So, I advice every one to be satisfied with the product and ignore some lesser faults. Go for buying if you have decided for Lenovo K8 Note. It may now be available at a cost of nearly 10000..

I wonder why there are so many negative comments on it. Has all the features of a pretty decent smartphone. Takes about 1.5hrs to charge with given 14Amps charger and more with normal chargers. Camera 7/10 Battery 8/10 Build quality 9/10 Software 7/10 Quite a bit heavy and huge for 5.5" mobile.. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Price worthy..beats all other devices in this price range.. Size: 4 GB | Colour: Venom Black | Verified Purchase. Best for what you pay...online system updates may reduce battery life, so better not to update. Superb gaming experience, speed with better cam quality...slow motion cam good in well lit areas. Dolby atmos is heaven in earphones. 13 + 5 MP rear cam n 13 MP front with party flash. Tempered glass does not fit full screen, due to curved edges n corners. Heating issue on continued cam use for longer durations. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic phone for the price. Size: 4 GB | Colour: Venom Black | Verified Purchase. This is a fantastic phone for the money, screen is large and vivid, amazing battery life (switched on 2 days with light use and still 40% charge left) and speedy. Strong wifi antenna and crisp/loud speaker volume. And of course stock Android 7.1. Very glad I bought this instead of Nokia 6 at similar price which has lower spec all round. The only small complaint I have is I wish the hardware touchkeys at bottom of phone were backlit at least in low light conditions, but it's easy enough to remember where they are..

This Lenovo product is just WORST AND BOGUS PRODUCT being cheap. No option to store contacts in device memory. For all you have to use Google's Photos, Google's Contacts, which may not be safe. But when you first try to update, it update and update and update for so many times (not data speed issue) for various versions of update. -So Called 13+5MP dual back camera and 13MP front facing camera are useless! -The so called 4000mAH battery does not lasts longer with very normal usage. Who has opened the non-removable and seen whether it is a 4000mAH. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars A blackhole for battery charge.

Was this review helpful? 0 3. By Sumit Joshi on October 16, 2017 | Verified Owner. I bought this phone 2 weeks ago. I wanted a phone which can cope up with my daily tasks, as I am not a heavy user. This phone does its work perfectly as it is supported by a new deca-core processor. The phone runs android 7.0 i.e. Nougat and some of you would be happy that this phone comes with stock UI and vibeUI has not been given this time. The processor is snappy, and the 4GB ram just helps it do it's work perfectly. But, one shortcoming is that the processor is a power drainer and along with full HD screen the 4000mAh battery just lasts up a day although a battery this huge should last upto 1.5 days at least. Talking about the camera, it sports a dual camera setup of 13MP and 5MP on the rear with flash, though good on paper the dual camera setup is nothing like what other phones offer. The phone also has a front 13MP camera with flash and shoots OK selfies though low light performance could have been better. This phone also comes with a finger print scanner which works quite well and is rear mounted. Though with some cons, this is a good product from Lenovo who are trying to get the hold of mid-range phone market in india.. Nice full HD Screen Snappy Performance Sufficient 4GB RAM Front camera flash Fingerprint scanner. Camera could have been better Battery life not as expected. Was this review helpful? 1 1.

News Lenovo K8 Note review: Good smartphone with room for improvement. Lenovo K8 Note review: Good smartphone with room for improvement. The Lenovo K8 Note brings a dual-camera setup at the rear and the near-stock Android experience, among other interesting additions. But is it worth spending your money on?. Updated: August 18, 2017 12:06 PM IST. Lenovo K8 Note – Specifications and Features. Lenovo K8 Note – Dual-camera setup. The Lenovo-Motorola two-brand strategy has been working pretty well for the Chinese smartphone maker in India. And while the company has released a number of smartphones such as the Moto C, Moto G and Moto Z-series in the past one year, Lenovo didn’t see much of action. After launching the K6 Power and K6 Note last year, the company took a pause, and has now released a new smartphone in the K-Note series. Called the K8 Note , the new smartphone brings in major upgrades to the range.. For those wondering what happened to the K7 Note, Lenovo mentioned that it wasn’t killer enough, so they had to scrap it altogether. The new K8 Note brings improvements in the form of a dual-camera setup at the back, upgraded high-resolution front camera with LED flash, deca-core SoC, battery with fast charging and more. The K8 Note is priced at Rs 12,999 (3GB RAM + 32GB storage) and Rs 13,999 (4GB RAM + 64GB storage), and will be available exclusively via Amazon India. Lenovo has sent us the higher end variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage.. The closest competitor to the Lenovo K8 Note is the Redmi Note 4, which has been Xiaomi’s best-selling smartphone online. And while the Redmi Note 4 lacks the dual-camera setup at the back, the Honor 6X and Coolpad Cool 1 do, and are priced well under Rs 15,000. The Lenovo K8 Note also runs the stock Android launcher to offer the clean Android experience, while also making firmware updates easier in the long run. But do these improvements make the K8 Note a worthy smartphone to purchase? We find out.. When it comes to design, there isn’t anything new or drastically different, although there are minor refinements. If you put the K8 Note, last year’s K6 Note and the Xiaomi. Redmi Note 4 next to each other, you won’t be able to tell the difference easily at first glance. Even the back of all the devices look similar – except the company branding and the capsule shaped dual-camera module. The 5.5-inch full-HD display dominates the front, with the earpiece, front-camera, LED flash and sensors placed above it. The capacitive Android navigation keys for home, back and task switcher are placed below the display. Sadly, they aren’t back-lit, and you are likely to struggle with those keys in the dark.. The back has a metal plate – with the top and bottom half made from plastic. The edges are slightly curved to ensure the smartphone properly fits in your palms. You have the dual-camera setup with dual-LED flash and a fingerprint sensor on the top half, with the Lenovo branding on the bottom half. The micro-USB port for charging and data transfers sits in the bottom, while the 3.5mm audio jack sits on the top.. In terms of buttons – the power / sleep button and the volume rocker sits on the right while the microSD card slot and a dual nano-SIM card tray is placed on the left. Having separate trays is a good addition as you can use two SIM cards as well as a microSD card for expandable storage without having to choose between either. Lenovo has also added a dedicated media button on the left, just below the SIM and microSD tray. Long pressing the button will play / pause music, whereas double pressing skips the tracks. You can even reconfigure the button to do other tasks – such as take a screenshot, start flashlight, or open a frequently-used app such as WhatsApp, Facebook or Instagram, among others. You can do this by heading over to Settings > Music Key .. The K8 Note features a 5.5-inch full-HD display with pixel density of 401ppi and 450 nits of brightness. The 2.5D curved glass screen is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. At the heart of the smartphone runs the 64-bit MediaTek Helio X23 deca-core SoC. Built on 20nm fabrication, the chipset features four Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.4GHz, four Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.8GHz, and two high-power Cortex A72 cores clocked at 2.3GHz. Lenovo’s choice of chipset is quite questionable, especially considering that other smartphones in the range feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC, which is built on 14nm fabrication, which is known for its combination of power and energy efficiency.. As mentioned above, the smartphone is offered in two variants – 3GB RAM + 32GB storage and 4GB RAM + 64GB storage, along with a microSD card slot for further expansion. In the photography department, you have a dual-camera setup at the back with a 13-megapixel main sensor and a 5-megapixel secondary sensor. One camera captures photos, whereas the other captures depth information. The camera can do multiple tricks, but more on that later. Up front, you have a 13-megapixel camera with LED flash.. The smartphone is armed with a 4,000mAh battery with fast charging support. Connectivity options include two SIM-card slots, 4G LTE with VoLTE for HD voice calling, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The K8 Note also comes with a water-repellent nano coating to keep it safe from accidental splashes of water or drizzling rain. Do note – it is water repellent, not waterproof. As far as possible, avoid dunking it in water to avoid damage.. Starting with the K8 Note, Lenovo is ditching the custom Vibe UI and going for the near-stock Android launcher instead. The strategy has worked well for Motorola – besides keeping the interface light, it also helps in delivering software updates faster. And for those who prefer customization, there are a lot of themes and launchers available on the Google Play Store to download.. The K8 Note runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat with the July 2017 security patch. Being near-stock Android, you get all the Nougat goodies such as split-screen view, 3D Touch-like quick app shortcuts, battery life improvements and more. Lenovo has added some customizations though – you get custom app icons, and a couple of software additions.. Lenovo has added its proprietary Dolby Atmos equalizer to improve the audio experience. It comes with several preset modes – dynamic, music, movies, game, voice and custom options as well. Sure, it does offer an improved audio experience on a good pair of headphones, but if you’re expecting that theatre-like experience – don’t be too hopeful. Another addition is the TheatreMax VR technology which basically splits the screen contents into two halves – be it games, music videos or movies. Unlike before, Lenovo is no longer selling the ANT-VR headsets, instead you can use any of the existing VR headsets easily available to enjoy the experience.. Lenovo has also pre-loaded some apps such as Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook, Skype, OneDrive and OneNote. Thankfully, they can be uninstalled too. The phone also comes with Google alternatives to its own apps – you get Google Photos instead of Gallery, Gmail instead of the default Mail app, Google Chrome instead of the default Android browser.. During my usage, I didn’t come across any issues in the day-to-day performance. I mostly use social networking apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Messenger and Instagram. I’m also connected on Slack for work related conversations and surf a lot a of sites on Chrome browser. Other than that, I also watch videos on YouTube, TV shows on Amazon Prime Video and Netflix. And occasionally, I do play games such as Asphalt 8: Airborne , Temple Run and Subway Surfers .. The MediaTek Helio X23 SoC along with 4GB of RAM did ensure smooth performance in day-to-day usage. Even with a few apps running in background, Chrome open with seven tabs, and listening to music, the smartphone did not show any signs of lag. Casual games also ran smoothly, however, I did see frame drops when playing graphics intense games such as Asphalt 8: Airborne .. The frame drops are visible and ideally, this is when the high-performance A72 cores are to kick-in, but it doesn’t seem to do the job well. Also, the back of the smartphone gets a little warm. For the first 10 minutes or so the heat is bearable, but then it gets a little uncomfortable to hold.. Battery performance of the smartphone is good. Turbo Charging helps to fully charge the phone in about an-hour-and-forty minutes, while 30 minutes of charging takes the battery close to 50% from near zero. In terms of battery life, with moderate usage, the battery easily lasts for over a day. On occasion, I was able to get about two days of usage, but the phone usually ran for a full day and some, with a screen-on time of over five hours.. Now, let’s talk about the key highlight of the smartphone – the dual-camera setup at the back. Among the different types of dual-camera setups, Lenovo has gone with a 13-megapixel snapper for clicking photos and videos, and the secondary 5-megapixel camera which captures depth information. Lenovo has modified the stock camera app and added a few tricks, as dual-camera setups are not officially supported by Google.. To begin with, the camera setup allows you to add DSLR-like depth-of-field effects to your photos. There is a depth mode that lets you vary the aperture between f/2.8 to keep everything in focus, f/1.8 keep subject in focus while background is mildly de-focused, and then there is f/1.2 which adds slightly more blur. Now about the tricks, the photo editor app allows you to refocus even after the picture is taken, crop the foreground and add a different background to it, and you can also keep the foreground colored while the background is black-and-white.. The camera quality is average to be honest. In bright outdoor lighting conditions, the photos look decent, with enough details. Indoor shots are inconsistent, and when there is artificial lighting the quality tends to take a hit, with some grain is visible too. Close-up shots look good at times, and at other times they are completely off in composure.. The dual-camera setup seems like work-in-progress. The depth effect often looks artificial – the depth sensor and software algorithms aren’t able to determine the edges properly, and smudging is easily noticeable. In the images below, if you notice the edges around the hair, you will be able to see the smudging.. As the camera isn’t accurately able to detect edges properly, the feature that lets you add black-and-white effects to the background doesn’t work pretty well too. It also affects the editing feature where you can super impose the foreground over any other background. Lenovo could still make it better by fine-tuning the software, but how much of an improvement it can bring remains to be seen. Low-light performance is again average at best. Some amount of graininess is easily visible, but given the price range the smartphone is placed in, it would be naïve to expect too much. Selfies taken from the front camera also look decent enough to upload on social media. Low-light selfies, despite having an LED flash, suffers from a bit of grain, but again, there’s not too much to complain about considering the price of the K8 Note.. On the whole, the Lenovo K8 Note is a decent smartphone in its price range that has a few hits over misses. The smartphone comes with a good design and build quality, the TheatreMax technology is worth talking about, and Dolby Atmos is a good addition.. The dedicated media button on the left comes in handy for frequently used apps. The water repellent nano coating is a nice addition to safeguard the smartphone from accidental splashes of water or rain. Near-stock Android helps to keep the device running smooth without any hiccups, only issues I noticed was during gaming.. However, I’m disappointed with the performance of the dual-camera setup, especially when it is the USP of the smartphone. There definitely is room for improvement, but how much better it can get is something that remains to be seen. The Coolpad Cool 1 and Honor 6X are other alternatives that you can look for in the same price segment. And if you don’t need the dual-camera setup, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 remains our favorite smartphone at under Rs 15,000.. Android 6.0 Marshmallow with EMUI 4.1.

Tile horizontally or vertically options for multiple Windows is not available.. Security and cache/memory cleaner is missing.. Only 2 GB RAM available for user.. Otherwise it is fantastic and absolutely great mobile.. Just try to provide some useful features for user like above-mentioned suggestions and optimize in next update.. 7 people also had this question. Message 2 of 29. I have quite a few issues but I read somewhere that I shouldn't voice too many concerns in one thread so these are the customization related concerns.. A lot of basic customization options are missing.. Adaptive brightness control is not very accurate and sometimes too bright or dark for the surrounding light conditions.. Notification LED doesn't work on most occasions and no customization settings are available for the same.. No clock positioning options on the notification bar.. Quick setting tiles are very rigid and don't have simplified options (eg. Tapping on WiFi tile to toggle, tapping on GPS tile to toggle between high accuracy or battery saving, etc). Night mode and ultra low brightness modes aren't available.. It's a wonderful device but it's negligence towards these tiny details that is stopping me from falling in love with the phone. No option to display network up and down speed on the notification bar.. Admin note; post merged in, subject edited.. Message 3 of 29. We need the vibe ui back with those features in lenovo k8 note.. Message 4 of 29.

Admin note; post merged in, subject edited.. Message 5 of 29. 1-led notification not blink on coming msg. 2-dolby Atmos not responding many times and not effective and loud sound (Note-earlier version of Lenovo phone. which have Dolby atmos it was a superb quality n loudness). shout down after plug long time to charging. 6-bluetooth take so much time to connect to Bluetooth speaker and play breaking sound. 7-call disconnect exactly after 17 minute 19 seconds(may be jio Network issue). 8-no option for save contect in sim or phone.

I also has been network and rear camera problem faced.so next version will update both problem solve please.. imei number edited to avoid possible abuse. Message 9 of 29. Message 10 of 29. After buying this so called flagship killer product i have experienced some many problems.. no way to clear all running apps until I scroll till the top of running apps screen.. Unable to see callers name on the screen.. I have to scroll the notification bar down to see the callers details and to answer the call.. I still use lenovo vibe p1 with 4900 mah battery which charges much faster than this so called turbo charger.. Another issue with the turbo charger is is ur continuously using ur phn while charging it will charge 5% in 25 to 30 minutes.. - 4G network on this phone is soo dam irritating that even standing near to a mobile tower u wont get full signals.. I am not sure why lenovo has added the front flash which hardly gives u any difference if u click a pic from frnt cam.. The things depth capture does could be performed via various 3rd party software.. Lenovo had made a big fool by saying it a killer phone.. Wasted my 14K on this dumb phone.
