Mobiles / XOLO Mobile Phones / XOLO Prime Price in India. Market Status: Available in India User Visits: 16 Launch Date in India: 13 May, 2015 Compare. Built pretty nicely Scores high on value for money factor. Could have sported a bigger screen. It has been some time since we saw Xolo in some smartphone market action. After having a great 2014 in which it was able to make it clear that it is no pushover, Xolo has been a bit out of action in 2015 till now. Never to be the one to get counted out easily, Xolo has finally come to the fore with a new smartphone named Prime. A side note says that its red back panel colour resembles that of Optimus Prime from Transformers. That aside, the Prime looks to be built pretty nicely for a budget smartphone and seems to have the second-generation Moto E in its cross-hairs. The Xolo Prime sports a 1.3GHz quad-core processor and it has been paired with 1GB RAM. The Prime runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop and comes with the ability to handle two SIM cards as well. Xolo has also thrown in 3G network capabilities which should make it a worthwhile option for those looking for all-day long connectivity. We would have felt better if Xolo had given the Prime 4G network capabilities too, but that would have led to price inflation. A screen measuring 4.5 inches across can be found on the Xolo Prime and it puts out display resolution of 800x480 pixels. There is a 5-megapixel camera on the back of Prime and it has been paired with a 0.3-megapixel snapper that performs duties on the front. There is 8GB internal storage space on Xolo Prime and it can be expanded further up to 32GB with the use of a microSD card. The Prime is powered by an 1800mAh battery for which there are no performance ratings available, but we think it should be able to survive for close to 8 hours of usage on a single full charge. The Xolo Prime looks nice, has decent power under its back panel and, in general, can hold its own against competitors like Motorola Moto E (second generation) and Micromax Canvas Spark (which Xolo identifies as the Prime's primary competitor). The fact that it sports a bigger-than-norm battery of 1800mAh capacity speaks volumes about Xolo paying attention on what it does.. 14,999 .00. 3,999 .00.
