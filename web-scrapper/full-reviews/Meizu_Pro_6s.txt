Exclusive interview with Leon Zhang, Meizu India. Meizu Pro 6s vs Xiaomi Mi 5s: Check out the Winner Between Affordable Flagships! November 10, 2016. Meizu hasn't got a much fanfare in India, but the Chinese company is enjoying good success in its homeland- China. Meizu's direct rival, Xiaomi quickly became one of the best smartphone company in India. Meizu Pro 6s vs Meizu Pro 6: Is It a Worthy Upgrade? November 04, 2016. Meizu, the Chinese smartphone vendor has added yet another device to its smartphone arsenal. The new smartphone goes by the moniker Meizu Pro 6s and is believed to be an upgraded version of the previously launched Meizu Pro 6.. Meizu Pro 6s to Come With a MediaTek Octa-Core SoC and 4GB of RAM: Everything You Need to Know October 20, 2016. Meizu has been working on a new smartphone and it will be touted as the upgrade to their Meizu Pro 6.

The new Meizu Pro 6s is essentially a Pro 6 with a better camera, bigger battery. Meizu may not be one for launch timing, but the company has taken the wraps off of the follow-up to the Pro 6 — the Meizu Pro 6s smartphone. The device is largely a refined version of the Pro 6, with a better camera and battery life.. that if you’re already a Pro 6 owner, there probably isn’t much need to buy the Pro 6s. The device, like its predecessor, has an aluminum unibody design with curved edges, as well as the same antenna bands found on the Pro 6. It’s really not that big of an upgrade, which is clearly why it’s called the Pro 6s rather than the Pro 7.. So what else is new in the Pro 6s? Not much. The phone features the same MediaTek Helio X25 chipset. with a 10-core processor, along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There’s no microSD card slot for the phone.. camera may sound like a bit of a downgrade at first. While the Meizu Pro 6 offered a 21MP sensor, the Pro 6s does away with that sensor in favor of a 12MP sensor. It’s important to note, however, that. the new sensor is a super high-quality. Sony IMX386 sensor with an f/2.0 aperture and 4-axis optical image stabilization.. While the Pro 6 has a 2,560mAh battery, the new phone has a much larger 3,060mAh battery.. Overall, the device is a little disappointing. Some were expecting the Pro 6 follow-up to feature a Samsung Exynos 8890 SoC or a screen resolution bump beyond the 1,080p display.. The Meizu Pro 6s runs Android with Meizu’s Flyme OS launcher over the top of it.

This entry was posted in Mobile Review. Meizu Pro 6s Mobile review: All in the detail. Posted on May 31, 2017 November 8, 2017 by Paul Carroll. Indoor Images: Good balance between texture and noise. Featuring a 1/2.9”-type sensor, 12Mp resolution and a f/2 lens, the Meizu Pro 6s produces pleasing photos in all lighting conditions, with generally good exposures and vibrant color rendition. It delivers outstanding detail, too, particularly in bright light conditions, where it rivals some of the top-performing devices we’ve tested, such as the Samsung S7 Edge. In low light, detail preservation is also very good, as the Meizu Pro 6s strikes a nice compromise between texture and noise for both photo and video results. Using flash with additional ambient light sources, photos are excellent, with accurate exposures, pleasant color rendering , and great detail. The main drawback we encountered, however, is very noticeable flare on backlit photos and videos when shooting towards bright light, which detracts from the overall good picture quality.. With the sun to the side or from behind, the Meizu Pro 6s recorded many excellent target exposures during our extensive testing, recording pleasant color and outstanding detail.. Shooting outdoors, or in bright light conditions, the Meizu Pro 6s delivers good target exposures, with wide dynamic range , in the majority of photos. In some HDR exposures of tricky high-contrast scenes, however, the device tends to slightly underexpose the image, resulting in a loss of some detail in darker areas.. How much of a drawback you consider this to be will reflect your personal preferences, as an exposure strategy that retains highlight details in very high-contrast scenes means that photographers prepared to do a little post-production enhancement can often adequately lighten the darker tonal regions for a better overall exposure.. Even without such post-production editing, however, the vast majority of outdoor exposures remain very acceptable for most users. The Meizu Pro 6s’s greatest strength is its excellent detail preservation when shooting outdoors, with the 12Mp sensor recording exceptional fine detail. The issue of heavy flare when shooting towards a bright light source can seriously detract from the overall quality of outdoor pictures, however. We shot many unaffected exposures with the sun coming in from the side or rear, but with strong light coming directly into the lens, very noticeable streaks of colored flare are a real concern.. In bright light conditions, the Meizu Pro 6s’s 12Mp sensor captures exceptional detail, with well-defined texture in the brickwork, to rival top performers such as the Samsung S7 Edge.. We recorded many excellent target exposures with wide dynamic range during our extensive testing of the Meizu Pro 6s outdoors.. In very high contrast scenes, the Meizu Pro 6s slightly underexposed some HDR exposures, losing some detail in the darker tonal regions as a result, but retained good highlight details.. The Meizu Pro 6s’s main drawback for outdoor photography is very noticeable flare when shooting directly into bright light.. The Meizu Pro 6s’s low-light photos offer good target exposure, with wide dynamic range, in what can often be challenging conditions for smartphone cameras. The combination of the f/2 lens, aided by a 4-axis Optical Image Stabilization ( OIS ) system, ensures good results even in extreme low light (5 lux), with images offering a very useable exposure, with more than acceptable texture and detail. Meizu has adopted a similar compromise on the Pro 6s for low-light photography as we’ve seen on other recent devices, such as the Huawei Mate 9, striking a good balance between fine detail preservation and low levels of luminance noise. The main drawback we encountered in low light was color rendering, however, with a slight pink colorcast visible, as well as some noticeable color shading , shifting from pink tones in the center to green at the edges.. In extreme low light (tungsten 5 lux), exposures are good, and although a slight pink colorcast and color shading are noticeable, the color remains acceptable overall.. In extreme low light (tungsten 5 lux), texture preservation is very good, with well-defined edges and a loss of only the very finest details.. In very low-light conditions (tungsten 5 lux), the Meizu Pro 6s offers a good balance between texture detail and noise reduction , similar to the Huawei Mate 9.. The only real drawback in low light (tungsten 10 lux) is noticeable color shading and a slight pink white balance colorcast, but overall, color remains acceptable for the conditions.. The Meizu Pro 6s’s video module records generally good exposures in all lighting conditions. Exposure adaption is also fast when changing between bright and low-light conditions, although some visible steps in adaption are noticeable. Video color is, on the whole, very good, with accurate white balance and bold color rendering, particularly in bright light. A slight shift in the color matrix is often noticeable during convergence between bright and dark scenes, but it’s not too distracting.. The main color drawback on the Meizu Pro 6s’s video files is again that color shading issue that we saw with stills, with visible shading in bright light conditions, as well as under-saturated color in low light. The stabilization system is effective for video, and aside from some jello and jitter effects visible with walking motion, videos are fairly stable. Autofocus is also very good, generally keeping subjects locked on during capture, with just the occasional overshoot apparent when shooting video in bright light. Texture preservation remains good in bright light videos, with only a slight loss of fine detail in low light. That heavy flare problem again raises its head when shooting backlit videos towards the sun, however, and should be avoided on the Meizu Pro 6s where possible.. Shooting video in low light, the Meizu Pro 6s displays some visible color shading, with a slight pink colorcast noticeable in the center, and undersaturated color rendition.. The Meizu Pro 6s achieved a very good score here, thanks to many excellent exposures in all lighting conditions, including extreme low light (5 lux). It lost some points due to slightly underexposed HDR images, but even here the results were acceptable.. The Meizu Pro 6s’s HDR exposure strategy slightly underexposes images in high-contrast scenes resulting in a loss of detail in darker regions, but the highlights are retained.. The Meizu Pro 6s recorded a good score for color, with bold, vivid, and pleasant hues in most lighting conditions and especially in bright light. Some undersaturated color in extreme low light, with visible color shading, and a noticeable blue colorcast in some outdoor pictures reduced the score a little, but on the whole, a solid result.. In bright light conditions, the Meizu Pro 6s renders excellent color, recording vivid and bold hues.. Featuring a phase detection and laser system, the Meizu Pro 6s achieves its joint highest category score for autofocus. In bright light it’s very fast, and although slower in low light, overall autofocus is fairly accurate and repeatable. It recorded some instabilities and failures in both preview and touch-to-focus mode, with some visible steps in convergence in preview mode, but they were fairly rare, and on the whole, autofocus performance was excellent.. The Meizu Pro 6s achieves excellent scores for both texture and noise in all lighting conditions. In bright light, detail is outstanding and stands up to comparisons with some of the best devices we’ve tested, including the Samsung S7 Edge. In low light, the texture score is lower, with the loss of some very fine detail and an increase in luminance noise (as you might expect), but it remains very respectable and provides a good balance between texture and noise.. In outdoor conditions, very good details preservation. Only very fine details in low constrasted areas are lost. In low light (tungsten 20 lux), detail preservation is very good.. Some noticeable artifacts , or optical deficiencies, are the primary drawback on the Meizu Pro 6s, resulting in one of its lowest category scores. The strong visible flare in backlit images can seriously detract from the quality of images shot towards bright light. Other issues, including visible ringing , moiré on high-frequency patterns, and a slight loss of sharpness between the edges and center of the frame are also noticeable on 100% crops, but these are less problematic overall compared to the flare.. Strong flare visible on backlit pictures (left). Noticeable moire over high-frequency patterns (right).. Slight loss of sharpness in the field (right).. Offering a 10-LED flash module, the Meizu Pro 6s records good flash exposures and achieves a solid score. In flash-only pictures, heavy fall-off results in noticeably darker corners, but when mixing flash with additional ambient light sources (as is often the case), target exposures are good, with less noticeable fall-off. When mixing flash with tungsten light sources, white balance remains pleasant in most shots, but we observed some inconsistencies in colorcast over repeated consecutive exposures.. Good detail preservation, particularly when shooting in bright light. Good target exposure and dynamic range in all lighting conditions. Vivid and pleasant color when shooting in bright light. Good flash exposure, color, and detail preservation.. Good stabilization, especially when shooting outdoors. Generally good white balance and overall exposure. Good texture preservation in bright light.. White balance has a visible blue colorcast when shooting outdoors. In low-light conditions, luminance noise is noticeable.

Meizu Pro 6S - is it an improvement?. The majority of the smartphone market audience is accustomed to the fact that the index "S", added to the number of a particular model, shows a major improvement over its predecessor. As the evidence of this phenomenon can be considered not only Apple products, but also, for example, Xiaomi, LeEco and other brands. What is the opinion of the Chinese company Meizu on this occasion?. A conspicuous change in the design is the "disappearance" of plastic strips of the back panel that are required for a stable mobile communication. In fact, one-piece metallic slim body will look even more expensive and more beautiful. The ergonomics also does not let us down. Using the display in 5.2 inches allows to keep the dimensions of the device comfortable to use with one hand. The AMOLED panel has a FullHD resolution, and superiors to that one of the previous "Pro" in terms of colors settings. Now the image will look even more natural and rich.. But the saving of the MT6797T. is the most controversial point in the new product. On the one hand, a big improvement in energy consumption and heating of the device was made, on the other - far from a record performance will become even lower today. Of course, it is enough for demanding games on medium-high graphics settings, but you shouldn't expect the reserve on the future from the "hardware". 4GB of RAM in combination with the MaliT880MP4 GPU don't help too. 64GB , there is no MicroSD-card support.. The main camera of the gadget performs a relatively new module Sony IMX386 , successfully tested in the MX6. Let the phone not to catch up with a high-grade camera in terms of definition and noise in the evening, but their quality is great for a mobile assistant. The capacity of the 3060mAh battery will be enough only for 5-6 hours of active time, that will reduce while using 4G. To merits we can refer a preserved ring of LED flashes, a fast fingerprint scanner and excellent FlymeOS based on Android Marshmallow. Thus, the device sometimes even inferiors to its ancestor. Will it become an obstacle in its path to success? The issue is complex.. Buy Meizu Pro 6S on Aliexprss.

Meizu has launched an upgraded version of the Pro 6 , and is calling it Meizu Pro 6s. The smartphone is a carbon copy of its base variant, with respect to design, but comes with upgrades in the camera and battery life. It is priced at CNY 2,699 (roughly Rs. 26,700), and is expected to launch in China soon.. The Meizu Pro 6s will be available in the same - Grey, Gold, Silver, and Rose Gold - colour variants, and will sport the same curve-edged aluminium body with identical antenna bands design.

The Meizu Pro 6s features a 12-megapixel Sony IMX386 rear sensor with enhanced with 4-axis optical image stabilisation, laser-assistance, phase-detection autofocus, and 10-LED dual-tone ring flash. The 5-megapixel front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture stays the same with large 1.4-micron pixels.. The battery has also been bumped up to 3060mAh (from the 2560mAh seen on the Pro 6), and this has caused the weight to also increase slightly. The Meizu Pro 6s measures at 147.7x70.8x7.3mm, and weighs 163 grams. The smartphone supports fast charging with mCharge 3.0 technology via a 24W charger.. The Meizu Pro 6s also has the 3D Press functionality seen on the base variant, and the fingerprint scanner is integrated under the Home Button.

The smartphone features a 5.2-inch Super Amoled full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) resolution display with a pixel density of 423ppi and Gorilla Glass 3 protection.. It is powered by a deca-core MediaTek Helio X25 processor with the 4 Cortex-A53 clocked at 1.4GHz, 4 Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 2.0GHz, and 2 Cortex-A72 cores clocked at 2.5GHz.
