Satu lagi Ponsel Oppo harga 1 jutaan muncul ke pasaran. Smartphone yang hadir dengan kode nama R1011 ini memang ditujukan bagi segmen pasar low end yang ingin merasakan sensasi smartphone berkelas. Dengan harga yang cuma 1 jutaan, ini jelas sebuah nilai tambah yang akan mempengaruhi nilai jual dari Oppo Joy Plus.. Namun pertanyaannya adalah apakah spesifikasi yang dibawa ponsel ini cukup berkelas? Ataukah sama dengan ponsel-ponsel murah lainnya yang menjual spesifikasi lengkap namun kualitas tetap murahan? Mari kita bedah sama-sama mengenai spesifikasi dan fitur apa saja yang dibawa Oppo Joy Plus.. Dilihat dari namanya, Oppo Joy Plus, jelas ponsel ini merupakan suksesor dari produk sebelumnya, yaitu Oppo Joy R1001. Bahkan harganya pun tidak terlalu jauh. Di toko onlne lazada, produk ini sudah terpampang dengan banderol harga antara Rp. Harga aslinya mencapai Rp 1,7 jutaan. Entah ini benar atau hanya takenik penjualan saja untuk menarik lebih banyak konsumen.. Jika melihat beberapa ponsel yang saat ini sedang marak di pasaran, maka Oppo Joy Plus akan bersaing ketat dengan Samsung Galaxy J1 yang juga dibanderol dengan harga 1,4 jutaan. Selain itu ada Lenovo S580 dan BlackBerry Jennings. Ada juga produk dari brand yang saat ini sedang berkibar, yaitu ASUS Zenfone 4C. Sedangkan di produk lokal ada Evercoss A76, Himax Polimer Li, Advan S5M dan masih banyak lagi.. Dari segi desain, mungkin tidak ada yang istimewa dari Oppo Joy Plus. Bentuknya mirip dengan versi sebelumnya yang tanpa embel-embel plus. Sekedar informasi saja, ponsel tersebut diproyeksikan untuk menggantikan peran Oppo Find Muse di pasaran. Saat ini Joy Plus R1011 tersedia dalam dua warna, yaitu putih dan biru tua.Namun, meski ini merupakan ponsel android berharga murah, bukan berarti dibuat dengan material murahan. Anda masih bisa menangkap kesan lembut dan stylish dari ponsel ini.. Oppo Joy Plus dibeali dengan sistem operasi Android KitKat, lebih baik dari sebelumnya. Dan seperti produk-produk sebelumnya, ponsel ini juga mendapat sentuhan antarmuka khas Oppo yaitu Color OS yang memudahkan penggunanya untuk menjelajahi keseluruhan fitur-fitur yang disediakan di dalam perangkat. Untuk menampilkan gambar, R1011 diberikan layar sebesar 4 inci dengan resolusi 480×800 pixels. Layar ponsel berteknologi IPS LCD tersebut membawa kerapatan layar sebesar 233 ppi.. Peningkatan terjadi pada kapasitas RAM, jika sebelumnya hanya 512 MB maka kali ini ditingkatkan menjadi 1 GB. Meski tipe prosesornya masih menggunakan dual core berkecepatan 1.3 GHz. Kinerjanya mnjadi lebih bagus baik saat digunakan untuk menjelajah internet maupun digunakan untuk keperluan multitasking. Semua bisa diproses dengan lancar tanpa adanya lag apalagi nge-hang.. Smartphone ini juga dibekali dengan dua buah kamera meski resolusinya tidak begitu tinggi. Di bagian belakang ada kamera berkekuatan 3 MP yang dilengkapi dengan flash. Di bagian depan hanya tersedia lensa berkualitas VGA. Sementara untuk menampung berbagai file gambar, video dan sebagainya telah disediakan memori internal sebesar 4 GB dan slot microSD yang bisa diisi hingga kapasitas 32 GB.. Handphone cerdas dengan kemampuan dual SIM ini menggunakan baterai berkapasitas 1700 mAh sebagai sumber daya kelistrikannya. Sementara untuk menjelajah dunia maya, bisa lewat jaringan data 3G maupun WiFi. Untuk konektifitas bertukar data ada bluetooth dan port microUSB.. Secara keseluruhan, Oppo Joy Plus adalah smartphone dengan spesifikasi dan fitur cukup lengkap. Harga yang murah menjadi nilai tambah bagi ponsel ini agar dipilih oleh masyarakat. Jika dibandingkan dengan saingan terdekatnya, Samsung Galaxy J1, Oppo Joy plus unggul di sisi prosesor dan kapasitas RAM. Sedangkan kekurangannya ada pada kekuatan kamera yang cukup jauh..

Oppo Joy Plus tetap bisa diandalkan untuk mewadahi file-file penting yang kawan Begawei miliki. Oppo Joy Plus ini adalah sebesar 4 GB. Ruang sebesar 4 GB tersebut sudah cukup untuk menampung banyak file, mulai dari file audio video, aplikasi game, atau file penting lainnya. Jika kamu belum puas dengan storage 4 GB, spesifikasi. Oppo Joy Plus di sektor ruang penyimpanan data juga menawarkan kemudahan. Internal memory pada smartphone ini bisa diekspansi menggunakan slot external memory card hingga mencapai kapasitas 32 GB.. Lini Fotografi Standar Namun Bisa Diandalkan. Oppo Joy Plus pada lini fotografi. Bisa dikatakan, sektor fotografi ini merupakan sektor paling lemah pada.

Oppo Joy Plus di pasaran juga terdongkrak dengan adanya konektivitas 3.5 G yang menyajikan sambungan data internet sengat cepat kepada pemakainya. Oppo Joy Plus juga sedikit banyak dipengaruhi oleh kecanggihan layar yang disematkan padanya, yaitu layar tipe IPS LCD Capacitive Touchscreen 4 inci. Hmmm.., dengan fitur standar namun tetap fungsional ini kira-kira harga. Sesuai dengan segmentasinya yang ditempatkan pada level menengah ke bawah, kisaran harga. Oppo Joy Plus memang akan sangat terjangkau, terutama di pasaran gadget Indonesia. Oppo Joy Plus ini adalah sekitar USD 100, atau jika dikonversikan ke mata uang Rupiah adalah sekitar Rp. Dengan harga yang sangat terjangkau tersebut, Begawei memprediksi bahwa. Oppo Joy Plus ini akan laris di pasaran Indonesia saat dirilis resmi pada Mei mendatang.

Kedua smartphone tersebut memang memiliki spesifikasi yang lebih tinggi, namun kisaran harga. Oppo Joy Plus jauh lebih rendah dari kedua tipe tersebut. Oppo Joy Plus adalah varian terendah diantara ketiga produk baru Oppo. Penempatan varian terbaru dari Oppo ini memang ditujukan untuk memenuhi permintaan pasar akan ponsel pintar yang murah, namun tetap berkualitas. Dengan spesifikasi mesin yang lumayan baik, kisaran harga. Oppo Joy Plus yang sangat kompetitif ini juga merupakan keuntungan sendiri bagi calon pembelinya.

OPPO Joy Plus Forum. 4 inch display with Android 4.4, Dual Core 1.3GHz processor and 4GB storage, 1GB RAM.. Please feel free to post your questions on this product.. pwede ba mapalitan case ng oppo joy ..nasira kasi casing nya pati pinduta... Malamang pwede palitan yang case pati yung volume button, pero hindi ko lang sigurado kung may nagbebenta ng mga parts na yun. Kung accessible sayo Greenhills try mo doon, or sa mga technician ng phones, minsan may nagbebenta sa kanila ng parts. Pwede palitan yan, pero ang magiging problema mo, saan maghahanap ng mga spare parts para sa smartphone mo. Hindi lahat ng Oppo stores nag bebenta ng spare parts, actually hindi ko nga alam kung talagang nag bebenta sila ng mga yun. ask ko lang maganda po ba kaya ang camera ng oppo joy plus nayan na tig 3,990?. Kung mahilig ka mag pictures, tingin ko hindi papasa sa standards ng "maganda" mo yung camera nitong smartphone, 3mp lang yung main camera nito and 0.3 naman yung front so hardware pa lang sablay na. Pwede mo icheck yung buong specs sa page na to:. hello po avail pb ang oppo joy r1011??. Magandang tanghali sa atin, mas maganda sana ito kung pwede pa ito maupgrade into a much higher version of Kitkat. Hi t0re Da greAt, as it shows Android OS niya ay KitKat at hindi naka indicate kung upgradeable pa ito to Lolipop kung yun po ang gusto niyo. Meron po talagang ganyang mga cellphone, kaya bago kayo bumili laways check its specifications first para maging aware kayo kung ma upgrade pa or not, here is the link para maview niyo specifications ng Oppo Joy Plus, then if you wish to enquire with the sellers this page just click the green button 'Go to Shop' or 'Contact Seller' para makuha niyo ang contact details nila and then you can enquire further kung gusto niyo po bumili ng items nila. Hope this helps you, Just a friendly advise this website is a price range comparison so if yo have further questions with the sellers please contact sellers directly. pag check ko nga din po kitkat lang ito sayang mganda panaman dn ang celpon na ito.. hi poh, sad to say hndi nga sya pwede upgrade unless cgro iroot ang fon, hehe un ata ung pwede mo ma download kht iba ang os mo hehe. Ahhm :) kaya po ba nito makapanood ng movie habang nAg lalaro? At matibay ba ito? Matagal ba ma lowbat ? Maganda ba ito pang picture? Sana masagot nyo thx. bsta samrtphoen naman mganda manuod ng movies eh. matibay cgro kasi imported naman to. Yup kaya niya ang movie habang naglalaro ka, yan po yung phone ko. Liliiitan mo po yung screen habang may iba ka ginagawa, kahit nagtetext ka pwede din makawatch.. 1 year na sa kin yung phone ko.. saan po pwde mag order niyan?. clear ba ang picture nito?? katulad din ba sa camera ng oppo neo5??? di ba blury?? plan ku kasing bumili ehh... Ah hello po.ask ko lng po if how much po tlga ung price ng xperia z5 premium?thanks po. Maganda po ba ito ano po ba mas magnda yung cherry mobile flare s4 or ito?. At nagagawa din ba neto yung kagaya ng sa mirror5? Yung kahit sa luck screen idraw lang yung M makakapasok na sa message?????. Iba pa din ang oppo kesa cherry local lang ksi, kita mo naman sa specs ang quality eh. Ok pa ang feautures kya nga sya mahal eh. Kung specifications ang ating pagbabasehan, hindi hamak na mas maganda ang cherry mobile s4. Bukod sa mataas na specifications nito mas maganda din ang style nito. Nakakahawig nito ang i-phone 5 at 5s. Kung sa quality naman, masasabi ko na matibay ang mga Flare. Meron kasi akong Cherry Mobile Flare at Flare S. Maraming beses ko na itong naibagsak at hanggang ngayon ay napapakinabangan pa rin. Malinaw at pwedeng makipagsabayan sa ibang camera ng top brands like Samsung, sony, LG, etc. Un nga lang, mababa ang battery capacity ng Cherry mobile Flare s4. Medyo kukulangin ito lalo na kung gamer ka. Hope this answer helps you a lot. Good luck and have a nice day.. para sa akin Cherry Mobile pasado na sa quality kahit local lang.. matibay naman to at may servcie center naman kapag nsira. avail pb ang oppo joy r1001???.
