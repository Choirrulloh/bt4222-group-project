alcatel Flash (2017) - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 ». anyone know about this phone can i get andriod 8 oreo when i buy it or not?. Can anyone please help me with finding the official retail firmware for this phone? I bought one from local market, but it seems to have a prototype testing software in it which is a little buggy and drains the battery. I searched the web for it's stock rom, but couldn't find any. I found out that this phone is actually made by TCL and the model is TCL 598. I'd really appreciate if someone could share the link to retail firmware.. Raj, 27 Nov 2017 U don't have option to move from phone memory to SD cards, phone restarts frequently could you explain more about this. U don't have option to move from phone memory to SD cards, phone restarts frequently. I am worried about this heat. I have flash 2 but sadly they ditched the phone software update,.. maybe the other flash series still have, well I dont know.... I actually bought the phone and is using it now. It isn't as bad as I expected it to be. It is actually pretty decent if you could look past the marketing hype for the dual cameras (very lackluster performance). The pictures lack details and there are very few options in the camera interface. You can take decent pictures with manual mode but in general the pictures are marred by a lack of details. BUT the oddest thing about the camera is the video clips are very clear and sharp. Design wise, the phone does stand out in a sea of iPhone or Samsung lookalikes. The design reminds me of the LG G4 and more masculine looking. Antutu score is 91381, recommended to play 3D games in low quality mode, CPU is deduced to be high end and can support large apps with "excellent" multitasking. Not as snappy as compared to Vivo V3Max but you cannot expect this from a phone of this price. Also I have not experienced any auto restart. The fingerprint sensor is not as fast as others like Oppo, Vivo or Huawei/Honor. Can be a hit and miss sometimes. Battery cover is removable to access the 2 sim card slots and one micro SD card slot. Can choose to use data from either sim card which is not possible with the Honor 8. The battery is not removable though. Battery is above average with 4 hours of on screen time of multiple tasks. The screen is good and bright. Better sunlight legibility compared to the Honor 8. The speaker sound is LOUD and clear even at maximum volume. A faint crackling sound can be heard though when you connect to the headphone jack. Not heard when the music is playing. Sound quality is decent with a very well balanced low, mid and high tones. Almost barebone Android so that is good. There is a support app that tests a few hardware on the phone for self-diagnosis. I thought I would go back to my Honor 8 but two weeks on I am still using it.. Still has NO gyro sensor for VR.. iawnaek, 30 Jun 2017 You should test other features. Sometimes is freezing and automatic restart. SammySong, 28 Jun 2017 I bought this phone at Lulu hypermarket in Saudi Arabia Original Price is SAR 1299 or US$ 346 ... more You should test other features.. But you can get this from Aliexpress for 197.49 USD only. Free delivery but must wait between 15 to 30 days.. Smile Twice, 19 May 2017 Hello fellows,. I bought one, from AliExpress like 9 days ago, so I don't have it yet, but ... more I got one and camera is not what I expected. I bought this phone at Lulu hypermarket in Saudi Arabia Original Price is SAR 1299 or US$ 346 but sold only at SR 799 or US$ 213 promotional price. I bought due to its unusual dual front and back camera setups and overall physical design is great with removable back cover (though) battery is not accessible/removable). What I can say as a hands on user. Bad quality compared to my oneplus 3. I off the phone and put it on sale after that. Heartbroken :( Haven't tested the other features though.. Everything looks good,but why is still Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)?. -_+, 08 May 2017 2017 device with a 2016 OS, awesome job Alcatel maybe you can launch a phone with specs from 2... more Like how HTC has done with HTC Bolt... I bought one, from AliExpress like 9 days ago, so I don't have it yet, but Damn I'm hyped about it. I'll make a good review here about the phone, so hope I get it fast. 2017 device with a 2016 OS, awesome job Alcatel maybe you can launch a phone with specs from 2020 and have software from 2015.

Single Review, online available, Short, Date: 04/05/2017. This display is quite big for a smartphone but frequently used for smartphones.. So, details like letters are bigger. On the other hand, the power consumption is lower with small screen diagonals and the devices are smaller, more lightweight and cheaper.. Only few smartphones are more lightweight than this.. The former French manufacturer of telecommunication equipment merged to Alcatel-Lucent in 2006. Several business segments were sold to other companies, so the Alcatel brand is now used by various companies. The Chinese company TCL uses the brand names "Alcatel One Touch" and "Alcatel Idol" for smartphones and tablets.. The market share in the smartphone + tablet segment is very small, but there are quite some recent reviews in different languages. The ratings are average (as of 2016)..

Alcatel Flash 2017: expect the best from its four cameras and 10-cores. 5.5-inch Full HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~401 ppi pixel density. Asahi Dragontrail Glass and oleophobic coating protection. Mediatek MT6797 Helio X20 chipset, Deca-core (2x2.3 GHz Cortex-A72, 4x1.9 GHz Cortex-A53, 4x1.4 GHz Cortex-A53) processor, Mali-T880MP4 graphics and 3GB RAM. Dual 13MP primary camera with f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus and dual-LED (dual tone) flash. Dual 8MP + 5MP secondary camera with f/2.0 aperture, autofocus and dual-LED (dual tone) flash. 32GB internal storage + microSD expansion slot up to 256GB maximum. The first of its kind, Alcatel Flash 2017 which is expected to be released in May – will have four cameras. A dual primary camera and dual selfie camera. So far, we have seen the rise of dual camera smartphones with more and more manufacturers fitting them as a standard. Mostly focus on providing great dual primary camera experience while others opt for a dual selfie camera. But to have both on a smartphone is totally breathtaking. And that is what Alcatel Flash 2017 will bring to the table come next month.. But what else is there for the smartphone? Let’s scrutinise it further then:. Alcatel Flash 2017 will be sporting a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS screen, which is considered to be the norm these days. Dragontrail Glass will provide the necessary protection on the front, while oleophobic coating will provide all-round protection at the back. A fingerprint sensor is there to help for biometric purposes. There’s no mention whether it will have a metal body or not.. With the Helio X20 chipset paired with a fast deca-core processor, great graphics and 3GB RAM – you can be sure of a speedy performance out of it. You can’t deny it is fast, but to have just 3GB RAM leaves some question mark. Perhaps a 4GB is the best for this kind of setup.. Now we’ve arrived to the best part about Alcatel Flash 2017, which is about its camera. If photography is your poison, then go ahead and enjoy taking great-looking photos with its dual 13MP primary camera setup. Bokeh effect is something that you should be practicing on. Or if taking selfies are all your photos all about, then the dual 8MP+5MP camera should be able to satisfy all your selfie cravings. Expect to take great-looking selfies and feel good as you upload them to your favorite social media sites.. Storage-wise, the 32GB internal storage will definitely be full in no time at all. Thankfully there’s an option to add a further 256GB so you can store more photos that you take.. With a 3100 mAh battery providing juice to the Alcatel Flash 2017, it should be able to power up the device for at least a day in between charging.. If there’s a dent on Alcatel Flash 2017, it will be on its dated Android Marshmallow 6.0 OS. Alcatel has yet to show that it has a working version of the latest Nougat 7.0 on any of its smartphones, so it might be a while before this smartphone gets the update.. Great hardware, great protection and even greater camera setup is the hallmark of Alcatel Flash 2017. Why choose between a great primary camera or a great selfie camera? With this smartphone, you get great cameras in a single device.. Alcatel Flash 2017 is expected to be available in May 2017 although there’s no confirmation yet on its price. There’s only one color available which is Titanium Grey ..
