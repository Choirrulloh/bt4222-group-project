I think it's a great phone considering specs for the price. I like this phone any way. I might get one for my son if it comes to my country.. This is the best BUDGET phone I am seeing from Huawei that also has a great design. The only thing I don't like about this phone is the mediatek chipset.

Test : Honor 6C Pro, un énième smartphone à moins de 200 euros ?. Prix public : 179,00 €. D'un design assez élégant et très abordable, ce modèle au format 5,2 pouces a-t-il suffisamment d’atouts techniques pour se faire une place sur le marché ultra compétitif des smartphones à moins de 200 euros. L'avis de 01net.com Huawei Honor 6C Pro. Un peu moins rapide que l'Honor 6C. - Le capteur photo arrière est légèrement proéminent.. - Le lecteur d'empreintes est placé sous le capteur photo arrière.. - L'écran 5,2 pouces affiche 1280 x 720 pixels (HD).. Les fonctions photo de ce smartphone ne resteront pas dans les annales. En plein jour, le capteur arrière de 13 mégapixels remplit correctement son office mais la qualité se dégrade fortement dès que la luminosité vient à manquer. Inutile donc d’espérer réaliser de beaux clichés dans les musées sans utiliser le flash.. - En intérieur, l'appareil délivre des clichés corrects quand l'éclairage est suffisant.. Nous n’avons pas été non plus convaincu par la vidéo Full HD, de qualité juste moyenne à cause d’un lissage d’image important, d’effets de fourmillement et de changements intempestifs de mise au point. Seule petite consolation, on évite les saccades constatées sur le Honor 6C.. Honor, la jeune filiale du constructeur chinois Huawei lance régulièrement des smartphones et on n’a parfois un peu de mal à s’y retrouver. Après le modèle 6C , voici donc le 6C Pro qui. légèrement moins cher (179 euros contre 199 euros). Est-il mieux équipé, voire meilleur - à l'instar du Honor 8 Pro vs le Honor 8 - que son frère aîné ? C'est ce que nous allons voir.. Par rapport au 6C, on ne relève pas de changement majeur dans le design, qui n’a rien de bien original mais bénéficie d’une jolie finition avec un dos plat en aluminium et des contours arrondis qui rendent la prise en main très agréable. Ceux qui attendaient un écran (presque) sans bords sur cette nouvelle version en seront pour leurs frais.. On apprécie toujours, en revanche, le lecteur d’empreintes digitales, situé au dos sous le capteur photo.. Il se montre relativement efficace et réactif, permettant de déverrouiller. le smartphone même lorsque ce dernier. La première différence avec le 6C se situe au niveau de l’écran qui passe de 5 à 5,2 pouces mais conserve une définition de 1280 x 720 pixels. ppp) n'est pas énorme mais c'est tout à fait convenable pour une lisibilité correcte. La luminosité de 452 cd/m² reste passable pour une utilisation en extérieur et le contraste de 1027:1, sans être exceptionnel, permet de profiter agréablement de ses photos et de ses vidéos.. Autre changement, l’appareil fonctionne sous Android 7.0 avec la surcouche EMUI 5.1, alors que le 6C avait été lancé avec Marshmallow. On apprécie les fonctions pour personnaliser facilement l’affichage avec, par exemple un écran d’accueil sans tiroir d’applications ou une. température des couleurs réglée en fonction de ses goûts.. Plus anecdotique, il est possible de faire apparaître à l’écran un bouton virtuel, à placer n’importe où, pour accéder rapidement à certaines fonctions (retour, accueil, verrouillage, tâches récentes, optimisation). Cela n’est au final guère convaincant, sachant qu’il n’est pas possible de personnaliser les fonctions disponibles. Nous avons également constaté que la fonction USB Host est présente, mais n'est pas activée par défaut et nécessite un changement dans les paramètres.. Côté puissance, le processeur MediaTek MT6750 à 1,5 GHz s’en sort honorablement et permet de naviguer de façon assez fluide dans l’interface, d’utiliser confortablement les applications courantes (navigateurs Web, Facebook, Twitter, etc), voire de jouer si les titres ne sont pas trop gourmands en ressources 3D. Bon point, l’appareil dispose de 3 Go de mémoire vive et de plus de 20 Go disponibles pour le stockage. En revanche, le 6C Pro n’apporte pas de gain de puissance par rapport à l’Honor 6C. Il se révèle même moins véloce si l'on se réfère au test AnTuTu 6, avec un score de 41176 contre 45409, dû principalement à des résultats inférieurs en 3D (4894 contre 7957). Les processeurs MediaTek sont souvent énergivores mais l’utilisation d’un écran HD permet de gagner en endurance par rapport à une dalle Full HD. Ainsi, l’autonomie en utilisation polyvalente se révèle correcte avec 9 h 25 min selon nos mesures. Pas de problème non plus en communications avec un résultat. satisfaisant de 19 h 31 min.. Un peu moins rapide que l'Honor 6C. Cet Honor 6C Pro est juste un lifting technique du Honor 6C, avec en prime une. baisse de prix de 20 euros. Pas de quoi le faire sortir du lot et le rendre particulièrement plus intéressant que d'autres modèles à moins de 200 euros. Pour le reste, ce smartphone bénéficie d’un bon niveau de finition et obtient des résultats corrects, mais sans plus. Si vous êtes prêt à mettre 20 euros supplémentaires, nous vous conseillons plutôt le P8 Lite 2017 de Huawei (199 euros), bien plus performant.. Soyez le premier à donner le vôtre.
