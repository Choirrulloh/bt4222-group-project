Regisseur(s): Martha Holmes , Michael Gunton. Vier jaar na het unieke wereldwijde bioscoopsucces van Earth komen de makers van de mooiste natuurdocumentaires ter wereld met een nieuw meesterwerk; ONE LIFE. Begeleid door de stem van Daniel Craig worden we opnieuw meegenomen op reis naar de meest indrukwekkende uithoeken van onze planeet. Door gebruik te maken van de allernieuwste cameratechnieken waren de filmers in staat om ongelofelijke verhalen van natuurlijk gedrag vast te leggen. De slimme jachtmethodes van dolfijnen en jachtluipaarden, maar ook hoe sluw Komodovaranen een waterbuffel door de knieën krijgen. Van de inventiviteit waarmee bruine kapucijnaapjes kokosnoten breken tot de versiertrucs van bultruggen. De film brengt ons van de geboorte tot de creatie van de volgende generatie en dan nog een stap verder. Zo blijkt dat er tussen al dat fascinerende natuurgeweld een rode draad loopt die al het leven - of we nu vleugels, vinnen, acht poten of twee benen hebben - met elkaar verbindt..

Pros: Android Nougat OS, sturdy metal build, bright, sharp 5.5"display and fantastic battery life. Cons: slightly slower processor, less internal memory and RAM than the Life One X2 and no FM radio. Verdict: at $150 this phone is a steal, but at $200 or $250 you will want to look around at other options. This is my third BLU phone, the others being a Life One X2 and a Studio C. Unlike the prior X2, the X3 has a sealed housing that gives the phone a more solid feel. The dual (nano) SIMs and micro SD cards are accessed via a small tray that slides into the left side of the phone. Unlike the 64GB X2, the 32GB X3's instructions say that that you can operate the phone with one SIM and the SD card, or two SIMs, but not all three at the same time. With the X3's smaller internal memory, this is a real setback. The X3's Nougat operating system is a big step up from the Marshmallow OS in the X2. Having learned from experience with the X2, BLU minimizes the number of (usually unwanted) factory installed aps and modifications on the X3 in favor of a more genuine Android experience. The screen scrolls smoothly on the X3's 5.5" screen despite having 3GB of RAM to the X2's 4GB. Nougat allows for fine adjustments to the screen's contrast and saturation. The X3 is not a gaming phone, but video and apps ran smoothly with the 1.3GHz Octa core Mediatek processor. I've not tried using the X3 in split screen mode. The X3’s 5000mAh battery combined with Nougat's power management features means I can use the phone all day without having to recharge. For comparison, the X2’s battery lasts me about 6-8 hours. Both phones support rapid charging with the supplied AC adaptors. The X3 still uses a Micro USB connection and not a USB Type C connection. The X3's 13MP front and rear flash cameras work very well. If, like my wife, you use the front facing (selfie) camera a lot, you will appreciate the X3’s upgrade to the X2’s 5MP front camera. I found the X3’s camera settings more intuitive and easier to use than on the X2. The X3 supports 5G wi-fi connections, as well as 2.4G connections, with the X2 limited to the later. One thing that bothered me is the X3’s omission of an FM radio (instead Next Radio software is bundled with the phone). Not all radio stations are streamed and having the radio is very handy when traveling or when you are in an area without service. With both the X3 and X2 currently selling for the same price on Amazon ($149.99), you will have to balance the pros and cons yourself in deciding between these two worthy mid-level phones.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Great Phone by Blu.. So far I have bought used and returned several phones by BLU and this one has met all my expectations. It pairs with my car seamlessly and Pandora's song titles and artists displayed without a glitch. There is an indicator light that alerts you mail or messages are incoming. Battery life is off the charts. It recognizes the 5G wifi band and connects efficiently. So far this is the best BLU I have owned. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent budget phone. This was definitively a great buy! I purchased this phone to travel and to add the 2 Nano Sim Cards that I have (1 with AT&T and 1 with T-Mobile) and the phone works excellent! The good thing about the phone is that the tray have the slot for the 2 Nano SIM Cards plus the slot for the memory expansion. For the camera, I will just simply say this: My main 2 phones (AT&T and T-Mobile) are LG G6 & LG V30 and this phone take way much better selfie pictures! (Something that I really hate in the LG phones.... Display: Amazing! 401 ppi, true HD in a 5.5 inch display looks beautiful! Sound: Yes, it was headphone jack and music sounds great with a good pair of earbuds. Battery: Wow, I'm impressed! 5000 mAmp battery in this slim phone design? Unbeatable! the only improvement area would be to have USB Type C, for everyhting else, this phone is at the level of Huawei 7X, Asus ZenFone 4 Max and Moto 5 G Plus.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars LOVE BLU, they are Bueno, Bonito y Barato :D. Love BLU products since first Life Pure i had in 2014 (excellent device 32 GB, 2 GB RAM on that time), i give it away to a friend on 2016 and it was still working perfect. Later i bought a VIVO 5 (another great devide from BLU i have no complains to) the one im using since today and im going to change for this Life One X3, to give it a chance. This one came with low expectations since i love my VIVO 5 who, even wirh the screen broken is still working great for me. This one looks stilish, a litte heavier than my VIVO 5 but is nice, quick charging, good performance since i bought it. The only problem is there is no case for this phone and the case BLU send is not drop resistant, the most important issue for me since im a working mom :D. Was this review helpful to you?. 4.0 out of 5 stars Solid phone with a couple very minor issues. Most important thing to note about this phone: I had an issue where some of my 64GB SD cards wouldn't work properly. The device wouldn't read my Kingston card or my generic card but the SanDisk card worked for some reason. I also have an issue where the YouTube app will freeze but ONLY on 1080p60 videos. (Had to restart phone into recovery mode and wipe the cache to fix.) Regular 1080p and 720p60 videos aren't affected. From what I've read online the issue is fairly common and not unique to this device, but I thought I'd mention it. Hopefully Google will fix it with an update. Otherwise, the phone is just great! Nice crisp screen, fast app loading and switching, long lasting battery, and the only "bloat" is the Amazon app, which you can fully uninstalled (I prefer the browser version). It was definitely an improvement over my "Blu Life Max," which I upgraded from. I even consider it better than the Nexus 5X, which I had previously (mostly because of bigger screen and battery). Been using this phone for a few weeks on Cricket (AT&T) LTE networks. It even gets a better signal at my mom's house than any AT&T phone I've had. I'll update this review if I have any problems with the phone.. Was this review helpful to you?. Bought this on recommendation , wanted to like it BUT This phone is very glitchy. I have had it less than a week and it just keeps freezing, both the touch buttons on bottom and... 1.0 out of 5 stars Glitchy, freezes often and short battery life. The left bottom speaker doesn't work but the phone is overall good for the price.. 4.0 out of 5 stars ... bottom speaker doesn't work but the phone is overall good for the price. Why pay iPhone and Samsung prices when you get smooth operation, nice cameras,strong battery etc...at such a great price.... 4.0 out of 5 stars Overall great phone. Why pay iPhone and Samsung prices when .... Haven't used it long yet to see if the battery life is as advertised. So far it's zippy as to speed in all apps. 3.0 out of 5 stars Not bad not great since I'm used Blu phones already. One thing I see is poor quality is the flash..... So weak no power at all.. This phone looks excellent on paper, mediatek octa core processor, 3 gb of ram, 13 megapixel back and front facing camera, 1080p display, and a 5000mah battery. 1.0 out of 5 stars Impressive on paper/unimpressive performance. I've owned several BLU phones over the last 4 years or so. Straight forward right now....this phone won't last 3 years or so. 5.0 out of 5 stars The phone feels amazing. Love this phone, super fast, 13MP cameras, two of them!, dual nano SIM, if you use only the 32GB internal memory, latest Android v7.0 and unlocked, what more do you want!!. 5.0 out of 5 stars Love this phone. When I have a conversation with someone, and I put the BLU Life One X3 on speaker phone, the person that I am talking to has a tough time understanding me. 1.0 out of 5 stars Speaker Phone Has An Issue. I bought two of these phones recently and according to the description it has two active SIM slots. What they do not tell you is the second slot can only be active with a 2G... 3.0 out of 5 stars Need to improve the dual SIM function and description. Bought this for my brother he was using the studio xl 2 , smaller screen on this one but 1080p and slightly bigger battery. Wished it had nfc but good so far. 4.0 out of 5 stars Great budget option for college students. This shopping feature will continue to load items.

Dimensions: 6.06 x 2.96 x 0.35 inches (154 x 75.3 x 8.9 mm). Weight: 6.42 oz (182 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Features: Fingerprint (touch), Touch sensitive control keys. Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging.

Shocker: BLU still uses microUSB http://www.bluproducts.com/devices/life-one-x3/images/vivo-xl-3-11.jpg. So the Moto X4 is USB-C and its greater than $100 more expensive then this sale with Amazon Ads. Are you going to pay that just to have USB-C lol?. ZTE has $100-$150 phone's comparable to this with USB C. So does about a dozen other budget phones that have been released this year including:. I could list dozens more too, microusb is pretty much standard in the under $200 segment right now. There is a lot to attack Blu for, this isn't one of them.. I like Blu, but I stopped buying micro USB more than a year ago. My daughter's last budget phone was $100 ZTE Z Max Pro.. No need to hunt around for that one cable in the entire neighborhood when the dozen that you've got already laying around will do just fine.. For me it's an instant no buy. Everything that isn't tethered to the wall in my house is already on USB C. All my families phone's (including the kids budgets phone), my laptop, and my Switch. We have extra USB C cables from 2 years ago laying around. There is no way I'm ever fiddling with a fragile one way connector again. Micro USB was way too limited.. Not everyone can afford to upgrade to the newest and fanciest technology as soon as it comes out. Even if it had USB C, this still probably wouldn't be the product for you.. Why do you promote these guys? Pre-installed malware, no updates, and when do get the odd update it brinks the phone. At $150, if you want an update you buy a new phone.. Why? My $30 Google Home Mini gets updates. Expect more and buying a new phone every year just because it doesn't get updates is wasteful.. A phone != Google Home Mini, the software is totally different lol. I hear there are some cheap Android One phones that get updates for three years.. Of course it's wasteful, but part of the reason you pay 3 times more for a phone that gets updates over the next 2 years is because you're paying for those updates. At $150 you aren't paying them to update your phone.. No! The higher price is not just for/because of updates!. You can buy a Windows machine for $150 and guess what? It gets updates! I can install Linux on a PC for free and it gets updates! Oh wait, let me guess... It amazes me some people think companies shouldn't have to support their products. Maybe BLU employees are trolling this post?. ME: "but part of the reason you pay 3 times more for a phone that gets updates over the next 2 years". YOU: "The higher price is not just for/because of updates!". We are in agreement only if you are brain dead... When are you going to make an argument why a $150 phone can't get updates?. Am I under some sort of obligation to?. Feel free to continue on making random comments that fail under scrutiny.. My comment only fails under scrutiny if your definition of scrutiny is "gross misunderstanding.". I don't agree with this logic. Does it count as promotion if they write an article about a phone on sale?. It's news that doesn't need to be covered.. If they stopped reporting on phones that don't get updates, they wouldn't cover many phones.. Google is paying 97$ per hour,with weekly payouts.You can also avail this. On tuesday I got a brand new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $11752 this last four weeks..with-out any doubt it's the most-comfortable job I have ever done .. It Sounds unbelievable but you wont forgive yourself if you don’t check it. Oh look, MJ complaining about petty things on AP again. Oh look, someone made a dumb reply and made it personal.. An OEM that had malware installed on their phone is petty? Wow!. You are actually gonna promote them after the shit they just did?. 5,000 mAh is nice, but without Qualcomm QC, that's gonna take forever to charge. Plus, I'd rather have a Snapdragon than a MediaTek SOC.. It doesn't have QC but the chip they are using is supported by Mediatek Pump Express (Mediatek's answer to QC), the version this supports is equal to QC 2.0. But that doesn't mean this phone actually supports it.. It means you'll most likely need to be tied to the in-box charger and cable. Still, I would consider the Motorola E4 Plus over this, which is around the same price for the Prime version on Amazon (as in, the same price as the discounted X3; it's cheaper when the X3 is not discounted). It has the same 5,000 mAh battery, but packs better specs and comes from a more reputable brand.. The E4 plus has a better camera but a worse display, performance will be about equal between the two.. The E4 will probably receive more updates (which isn't saying much, between the two phones, to be honest), but also supports CDMA carriers, has FM Radio (not sure about the X3), and more LTE bands. Qualcomm also has better modems in general, which means better service with less battery used. There's a lot more in it that simply Qualcomm vs MediaTek at the surface.. Personally, I've been more satisfied with Blu than Moto. I've so far bought 2 of each. Moto just makes promises then breaks them and the device quality is nearly the same to slightly worse.. Apparently, your talking to yourself there since you thought of it.. lol- I normally don't post comments on AP but your BS meter is hilarious.. Thank you! Glad I could provide some positive entertainment here today. I, too, bought into the whole cheap phone thing one and only one time with BLU. I needed a spare phone for the days when I wasn't willing to risk whatever flagship I had at the time, and I realized that BLU's software and hardware were strangely familiar - it was literally as you said - a rebrand of some shitty Chinese software and hardware. Their whole "we're an American OEM" shtick drives me crazy while we're at it!. For the budget phones costing under $150 there is really no difference between Blu and Moto. But for anything costing over $200 (which this supposedly will sell for) I would choose Moto. Blu has been using the MediaTek MT6753 in their phones for like the last 2 years. You'd think it would be time for an upgrade.. BLU makes a lot of phones. BLU doesn't make or design any phones. This seems to be ignored ALL the time here. There is absolutely nothing reputable about BLU.. Not all the phones they make are rebadged Gionee's. About half are, the rest are made specifically for a consortium of brands that includes Blu, Allview and a few others by various Chinese OEM's.. But there is literally no point in telling consumers who manufactured the phone, Blu is the one that is selling them, Blu is the one that is responsible for customer support and Blu is the only one they will ever deal with.. BLU is no fucking different than that Canadian start-up who got crushed here for being shady about their "own designs" and whatnot. I'm going to continue calling a spade a spade.. You do know that a lot of brands don't use completely original designs? Nearly every smaller brand uses ODM's to design their phones.. What point is there in an author including that in an article? Should they also say that Apple phones are made by Foxconn in China? It's useless information.. You're more than welcome to continue to defend this absolutely trash company if you like with other people. I, like many others, was curious why AP would link deals to said trash company.. Not defending them at all trying to figure out why mentioning Gionee is useful. You still have yet to provide an actual answer.. Outdated processor and camera setup for a phone that they plan to sell at $249, even at $149 it's not that great of a deal. Should have at least a Helio P10 for this price.. All that battery, and the screen is still less than 6 inches? Could have packed a bit more battery in made that screen a smidgen bigger.. I don't get why they call this one a successor the X2. The X2 had more RAM and a better camera... I like the bigger battery and screen but not sure about the trade off.. BLU phones and software are rebadged junk. Do not buy anything from BLU. You might, and probably will, regret it. Just buy last years flagship or something.. You can get Sony phones that are better than this and Sony phones are not fabulous in any marked way.

http:/ / www.phonescoop.com/ articles/ article.php? a=20091. Blu's latest unlocked smartphone for the U.S. market is the Life One X3. It boasts a large screen, humongous battery, and stock Android. Here is Phone Scoop's full review.. The Blu Life One X3 is an affordable, unlocked Android handset with one of the biggest batteries in the market. If battery life is your top priority, the Life One X3 and its incredible power supply may fit your needs.. The X3 is a large black slab. It's formed by a mix of plastic, metal, and glass. The front features curved-edge glass that's fitted into a polycarbonate frame. The frame has beveled edges that are painted with a faux dark chrome finish to give it the look of polished metal. A large metal plate covers most of the phone's rear surface. The phone doesn't do much to stand out and yet there's nothing objectionable about its looks.. The X3 stands more than 6 inches tall and sits about 3 inches wide. You have to like big phones in order to like the X3. People with small hands may find it too large. The curved shape of the rear panel and rounded side edges do help a bit when it comes to in-hand comfort. The phone is weighty; you'll know it's in your pocket as you move around. I didn't run into trouble stuffing it into pockets.. I didn't see any gaps or unevenness in the seams. The metal rear gives the phone a much-needed boost in the perceived quality department. Of note, the X3 is not waterproof, nor is it designed to be particularly rugged.. With little unique about the design, the X3's face could easily get lost in a crowd. The forehead and chin are somewhat thick, as the phone makes use of the 16:9 aspect ratio for the screen. A capacitive home button is tucked into the chin. It's indented a bit, which makes it easy to find and use. Capacitive buttons flank the home button. With no backlight and no physical shape, these keys are a pain to locate consistently. (No backlight, Blu, seriously?) Small dots painted on the glass signify their location, but even these are difficult to spot. Blu doesn't even clue you in onto which button manages which function.. The tray for memory and SIM cards pops out easily with a tool or paperclip. The tray accommodates a microSD storage card and up to two SIM cards at the same time. (Often, phones that support two SIM cards require you to give up use of the memory card spot; the One X3 doesn't.) That makes it more flexible than many dual-SIM phones.. Like many phones, the X3's screen lock button and volume toggle are placed on the right edge. The lock button has a great profile and excellent travel and feedback. Finding and using it is a breeze. I appreciate the large profile of the volume toggle, too, though travel and feedback aren't quite as satisfying.. Blu stuck a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top edge of the phone. The company opted for a microUSB port (rather than USB-C) and positioned it on the bottom edge.. The black paint that covers the rear panel has a matte finish that shows just a touch of grain. The metal panel skins about 85% of the rear surface. Horizontal lines run from side-to-side near the top and bottom edges that separate the metal panel from the plastic ends where the antennas lie. This is a common design for Blu. The camera module protrudes from the surface just a wee bit.. The Blu Life One X3 doesn't trailblaze any new paths in terms of design or features, but it is a functional piece of hardware that works well enough.. The One X3 has a 5.5-inch full HD display, a fairly typical size/resolution for flagship phones as recently as two years ago. It relies on the older 16:9 aspect ratio and is anything but bezelless. An LCD panel provides the light. The pixel density is tight enough that you won't spot individual pixels; everything on the screen looks sharp and clean. Brightness is adequate most of the time. The screen is hard to see outside, due to a mixture of glare, fingerprint grime (no oleophobic coating!) and brightness. You need to crank it up to use the X3 outside. There's no blue shift, but the loss of light is severe. Given the price point of the phone, it's a decent screen.. Blu tossed in its MiraVision feature for good measure. This tool lets you tweak the color profile. There are two presets — standard and vivid — or you can opt to manage all the settings manually. The vivid option, which boosts colors just a little, looked best to my eyes.. Blu ensured the One X3 is compatible with the core LTE frequencies used by AT&T and T-Mobile. You'll find support for Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 17, and 28 on board. Bands 2, 4, and 12 are what's needed for the device to connect to AT&T and T-Mobile with basic service. (Both carriers operate additional bands, and phones that support them enjoy faster data and less network congestion.) As tested on both networks, the One X3 did just okay.. The phone managed to patch calls through on the first or second try. It dropped one call on each network when tested at highway speeds. Poor network conditions challenged the One X3 a bit more than they would carrier-branded phones, but it managed to do about as well as other unlocked phones in this price category.. Data speeds were nothing to write home about. Maximum data rates were in the low teens, which is about one-third, to one-fourth as quick as today's top handsets. The X3 can handle basic browsing and social networking, but streaming media over cellular often gave it a case of the stutters. Support for more LTE would likely have helped here.. I've heard much better voice phones in my day. Phone calls taken through the earpiece are acceptable at best. The earpiece doesn't produce quite enough volume even when set all the way up. If you do crank it, it distorts to the point of making phone calls painful.. Voices come through as garbled junk. You may be able to take a regular call in a quiet space, but the speakerphone is close to useless pretty much anywhere there's background noise.. Ringers and alerts did their job and caught my ear most of the time. At 5,000mAh, the One X3's battery is larger than nearly all others in the market. It's a wonder, then, that it doesn't quite live up to expectations. I went into testing the X3 fully believing the phone would be capable of pushing through two full days of use. Instead, the phone gave up the ghost at about the 24-hour mark.. After charging overnight, I unplugged the phone at breakfast and then tested it for a full day with all the radios on and the screen set to 50% brightness. At bedtime, the phone had about 40% battery life. Left unplugged, the battery dropped 25% overnight despite the fact that the phone wasn't used at all during that period. I woke up to see the battery at 15%, which lasted a couple of hours before dying completely.. Stunningly, you will probably need to charge this phone each night. I don't think most people are in danger of running out of power before the end of a single day, but don't expect much more than that.. The phone includes the base system-level battery management tool. Worse, the phone doesn't support rapid charging and takes forever (we're talking hours) to fully recharge the battery.. The phone's Bluetooth radio handled connections well. The phone paired easily with headphones and speakers and PCs. Calls completed via Bluetooth headsets were pretty bad, though music routed to Bluetooth speakers was acceptable.. As a navigation tool, the One X3 performed on par with other unlocked handsets. The GPS radio pinpointed me in several seconds to within about 25 feet most of the time. It coordinated with Google Maps and worked fine when put to use for point-to-point directions. Maps was sometimes a little slow during navigation.. The X3's WiFi radio did well.. This phone does not have NFC.. Blu is back with another Android handset for U.S. consumers who prefer the unlocked life.. Blu Life One X3 Adopts Metal-and-Glass Design and Packs 5,000mAh Battery. Blu Products today announced the Life One X3, a mid-range handset from the unlocked phone maker. The One X3 has a curved-edge glass screen and an aluminum frame painted in matte black..

After my Samsung Galaxy S5 was conveniently taken on a flight from NY to London I needed to find an unlocked phone that would come in close to the S5. Luckily my brother bought the BLU Studio X8 HD as a travel phone which he loaned me for the trip to London and had his UK sim card in it for use. I found the X8 HD to be really good for a $50 phone so I became interested in what Blu had as a higher end option and that is where the BLU LIFE ONE X2 comes in. I first read the reviews on Amazon and tallied the 4 and 5 star reviews which gave it a 75% positive rating, then I looked at PC Magazines rating of 4 stars which gave me the go on purchasing this phone. The BLU LIFE ONE X2 does not suffer from bloatware which is great. The electronics is top notch and up to par with many name brand phones that are marketed down our throats. The one negative in many reviews has been the camera but that is a false negative as for my discovery the camera takes very good pictures. The issue with many of BLU's phones and other brands is actually the camera software, hardware wise it is great so I would give it an 85% rating overall for the camera. I have added some photos and video which will give one an idea of what a great job of taking pictures this phone actually does. The colors are identical to what the eye sees and that is a very important marker in gauging a phones camera, also takes excellent low light photos! The phone comes with the latest Android Marshmallow OS which manages battery usage extremely well. With the Samsung Galaxy 5 I would have 30 percent battery life after 8 hours where now with the BLU LIFE One X2 I am at 70% in the same amount of time. The phone comes with a Qualcomm fast charger which will "In 30 minutes of charging you get up to 70% of your battery, and with only 5 minutes get up to 2 hours of talk time.", I can confirm that claim and what a great time saver to have! I will edit and update this review, so feel free to ask any questions.. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars PHONE SHIPS WITH UNDELETABLE SPYWARE. Color: Grey | Offer Type: 64GB+4GB RAM | Verified Purchase. This is a very long review. If you’re like me, when you’re on the verge of buying a product on Amazon, the final step you take it is to read some of the lowest reviews. If you’d like this review’s quick takeaway, it’s this: THE BLU LIFE ONE X2 SHIPS WITH SPYWARE BUILT INTO ITS SYSTEM THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNINSTALL OR REMOVE VIA FACTORY RESET. The spyware steals text and call information. This was a deal breaker for me, and I returned the two handsets I ordered in April 2017. Please continue reading for more information. A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON MY SITUATION: I can’t stomach the idea of purchasing an $800 phone or being locked into a 2-year contract, so I look for inexpensive unlocked phones to use on my no-contract $45 per-month plan. I don’t expect the very latest technology, but I also don’t want to struggle with my phone since I use it so frequently. I’m willing to take some level of risk if the price point is good enough. I’m tech savvy and able to use Google to troubleshoot tech issues that perhaps might deter folks who want their electronics to “just work.” THE PROS: The BLU Life One X2 is a phone I wanted to love. It’s incredibly cheap and its feature set is amazing for the price: all-day-plus battery, fingerprint sensor, Quick Charge, dual SIM slots, microSD slot, minimal bloatware, fast and responsive, and a very decent form factor and weight. The bang for the buck on this phone is incredible. For me, the BLU Life One X2 met nearly almost all of my phone requirements at a rock-bottom price. THE CONS: Unfortunately, the phone ships with built-in spyware. I use Lookout and Malwarebytes for cyber security on my phone. Both apps picked up that the phone has spyware in a system app named Wireless Update (IMAGE #1). My phone shipped with version 5.3.0.1.003. This spyware sends information from one’s texts and calls to servers in China. This is a documented issue that BLU has acknowledged with previous handsets (see BLU’s comments on other negative spyware reviews). One can update the Wireless Update to a later version without spyware (IMAGE #2). The issue is that this update introduces malware in the form of Android/PUP.Adware.YeMobi.a (IMAGE #3). These issues are impossible to uninstall or clean. They are built into the phone at a system level, so a factory reset will not remove the spyware or malware. I ordered a second BLU Life One X2 to confirm that this was an issue with the phone and not something I mistakenly introduced in some way. I started the new phone and installed only Lookout and Malwarebytes, ran scans, and discovered the same issues. The two phones I ordered have build dates of 2/2017 and 3/2017. One of the major reasons I was high on the BLU Life One X2 is that my wife has happily been using one since October 2016. Hers has a build date of 9/2016 and has no malware or spyware issues (IMAGE #4). I’ve spoken with BLU’s customer support several times, and the representatives seemed unwilling or incapable of assisting with the spyware. I’ve received conflicting advice and extremely poor advice. One representative suggested I uninstall Lookout and Malwarebytes and that this would solve my spyware detection issues, as there would be nothing to flag the spyware. I sincerely hope this was a “lost in translation” issue. The representative read a form letter that stated that the spyware detected is not actually spyware. I’d rather trust a third party who specializes in cyber security. Another representative told me that there isn’t a single supervisor who could help me or make outgoing calls to return my call. This seems to be an increasingly common customer support issue at call centers lacking in resources. I’m not crazy enough to suggest a budget electronics company should have excellent and extensive customer support—but Chinese spyware in BLU’s phones is a huge issue. They should take it much more seriously. Unfortunately, many customers do not use apps such as Lookout or Malwarebytes, so they may be unaware that there is spyware on their phones. I am planning on shipping the two Life One X2 phones and the BLU Life One X2 Mini that I also had issues with back to Amazon for refunds (IMAGE #5). I hope my review was helpful. I want to save other customers the headaches I’ve experienced. I’ll try to answer any questions in the comments below.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars.

Features Fingerprint (touch), Touch sensitive control keys. Resolution 1080 x 1920 pixels. Features Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features Touch to focus, Face detection, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Shooting Modes High Dynamic Range mode (HDR). Camcorder 1920x1080 (1080p HD) (30 fps). Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. Camera sensor size - A bigger camera sensor is able to capture more light, and thus produce better photos.. Pixel size - The size of an individual pixel on a camera's sensor. Octa-core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit, 28 nm. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Filter by Album, Artist, Genre, Playlists.

GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. FCC ID value: YHLBLULIFEONEX3 link. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $150 Buy.

Compare Phones and Plans Compare Cell Phones. Trending: iPhone 8. f g+ t yt. I’ve been testing the BLU Life One X3 for the past few weeks now. And in my testing, I found this phone to really excel in two key areas: battery life and performance. It’s also worth noting that the price of this handset is extremely appealing right now. BLU is selling this phone for $150 for a limited time. But the price will shoot up to $250 very soon so links below if you want to view the Amazon listing.. Now BLU is kind of known for producing smartphones with very appealing spec to price ratios. The Life One X3 is a well-rounded budget smartphone. For example, it features a metallic build construction that feels cool to the touch and relatively premium. What separates this build from the builds of say the new iPhone and Galaxy phones is the separation of material. It doesn’t feel quite as sturdy or ergonomic in the hand as the higher end Android or iOS devices. Often times when I review a budget BLU smartphone, I usually find a “HD display” but it tends to be a mediocre 720p resolution LCD panel. Here we have a Full HD 1080p panel with fairly thin side bezels, solid viewing angles and color vibrancy. We’re looking at a 400ppi, which is certainly retina-pleasing. Content looks pretty good on this display.. There are 3 capacitive touch navigation buttons below the display that you should know about: the back button is to the far left where it should be, the overview button is to the far right, and there’s a home capacitive touch navigation button with a built-in fingerprint scanner that works pretty well. The registration process is pretty time-consuming but once you get all your fingers registered, it doesn’t lock the phone pretty quickly and it’s fairly reliable.. I like BLU’s hands-off approach with the software. It’s running Android 7.0 Nougat and it feels like it’s straight from Google. The default home launcher features Google Now one swipe to the right. Apps don’t have custom skin icons. With the 64GB octa-core MediaTek processor paired with 3GB of RAM, there’s not a whole lot that this phone can’t handle. You will notice some herky-jerky movements at times when loading apps for the first time and when loading web pages but generally speaking, it performs well for its price category.. The main 13-megapixel camera sensor should work well for the occasional photo, whether it be for Snapchat or via a PDF scanning application or what have you. But the camera performance is really where this phone falls flat against the competition. The sensor features a 2.2 aperture that isn’t up to snuff with the f/2.0 aperture or larger sensors on some other BLU smartphones or other Android phones in general. Also, the software feels really outdated and janky. The shutter speed is also hit or miss. Sometimes it’s fast, other times it’s painstakingly slow. With that said, there is also a 13-megapixel front-facing sensor and when compared to other front-facing sensors, it’s not that bad. There’s even a flash for low-light selfies.. As mentioned in the beginning of this video, battery life is excellent. Under the hood lies a 5,000mAh battery that supports quick charging. You should be able to get two days of moderate to heavy usage with this phone, maybe even longer if you don’t use your phone very much. There is a bottom-firing speaker but it’s pretty average and there’s nothing really special to see here.. The Life One X3 is globally unlocked and it works with all GSM carriers here in the US. It’s tough to recommend for the full retail price of $250. But if you can scoop it up for $149, you should be a happy camper. This price will not last long. I don’t know how long it will last. It’s just a launch deal so visit the link to learn more and if you’re watching this video and the limited time launch deal is not available, I recommend you bookmark the Amazon page and just keep checking back to see if there’s a deal going on.

BLU Life One X3 makes proper commercial debut to erase painful One X2 memory. Adrian Diaconescu December 14, 2017 10:58 am. The “market leader in unlocked devices in the United States” hasn’t always made headlines for the right reasons , taking possibly its biggest reputation hit yet just a few weeks back .. But although most BLU Life One X2 owners probably wouldn’t be caught dead now purchasing another phone of the same brand, the American designer and vendor of China-made products is already in pursuit of an audience for the Life One X3.. Listed on the company’s website even before the One X2 bug was fixed, this new budget champion is available from Amazon starting today at an irresistible $149.99. That’s if you choose to ignore the many red flags associated with the BLU Products name of late, and also, if you hurry, because the handset’s MSRP is actually $249.99.. You can get $100 off “for a limited time” with no strings attached, and we must admit, the BLU Life One X3 looks pretty amazing on paper at 150 bucks. Made of premium “aircraft grade” aluminum, with minimal plastic parts, and a 5.5-inch Full HD curved glass display, the mid-ranger runs Android 7.0 Nougat out the box.. That means you may not be looking at any major software updates very soon, which might be for the best. Not exactly a powerhouse, with an energy-efficient MT6753 processor under the hood, the One X3 packs a decent 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage while promising “up to 2 days of standard usage on a single charge.”. That sounds unrealistic… until you read the figure listed in the battery capacity section of this bad boy’s spec sheet. 5000 mAh is a whole lot of juice, and remarkably enough, we wouldn’t describe the BLU Life One X3 as particularly chubby either, at 8.9 mm.. Sold unlocked, with nationwide GSM LTE connectivity, 13MP rear and 13MP front cameras, fingerprint recognition, microSD support and quick charge capabilities, this thing feels almost suspiciously dreamy.

BLU Life One X3 – Mid-Range for the Modern Age. Android , BLU , Reviews. MediaTek 6753, octa-core CPU @ 1.3 GHz. BLU continues to plug along with model after model , filling the low-end and mid-range with plenty of options. Some are good, some are very good, and some are just OK. One thing they all share, though, is value. Whether you have $100 or $300 to spend you will certainly be able to find a phone that fits your needs. Today, we’ll take a look at one of the newer models, the Life One X3. It’s available for $149 (for a limited time) from Amazon and at that price it is quite a bargain.. In what will be somewhat of a recurring theme in this review, the Life One X3 is a very nice looking and feeling phone for its price. The phone is only available in black. That might be a bit of a bummer to some as last year’s Life One X2 was also available in pink but I think it looks great.. The front of the phone is dominated by a 5.5 inch Full HD LCD display. There’s a veiry Moto-esque oval fingerprint reader below the screen. Above the screen is the front camera with LED flash. The power and volume-rocker buttons are on the right side. There’s a micro-USB port (still no USB C from BLU) and a single speaker along the bottom. The left side holds the dual sim/microSD (up to 64 GB) slot. Along the top edge is the 3.5 mm headphone jack.. The back of the phone is an all aluminum affair and it feels great. It’s not soft-touch but the powder coating on it is easy to hold on to and feels great. The whole package is only 8.9 mm thick, which is amazing considering it packs a whopper of a battery. As with most BLU phones these days the package belies its budget price.. At 5.5 inches and 1920×1080, the display comes in at 400 PPI which is perfectly fine, even in 2018. As with every BLU device I’ve used this one is LCD. LCD isn’t my favorite display tech but the screen on the Life One X3 looks great. At its brightest it is plenty bright. At its dimmest it is perfect for use in a dark room.. BLU includes the MiraVision settings utility to allow you to customize the display appearance. You can set the screen to Standard, Vivid (my favorite), or a user mode that lets you customize things yourself. The Vivid mode makes things pop a bit and look a little closer to a tuned AMOLED display. I also like to enable dynamic contrast. Overall, it’s a good display made better with the ability to customize it.. In terms of raw benchmark numbers, a sub $250 phone like the Life One X3 will never matchup with phones like the Galaxy S8 or Pixel 2XL. What I look for, as a reviewer, is whether the device is “good enough” for day-to-day use. That’s totally subjective, of course, so we also provide the benchmark numbers to give you an idea of how the device stacks up. And, in my opinion, the Life One X3 does well both ways.. The phone has 3 GB RAM, which is still respectable and 32 GB storage. Storage is expandable by 64 GB using microSD. The CPU package is the octa-core MediaTek 6753 with Mali-T720 GPU. Per Geekbench 4, the Life One X3 grades out like a Nexus 6 or Galaxy S6.. Navigating around the device shows it to be smooth and responsive. Apps launch reasonably quickly and I had no problems running my normal complement of apps – Chrome, Newsblur, Allo, Netflix, Amazon, and more. I also want to mention the fingerprint reader. Everyday usage proves the device to be just as capable as the Moto Z2 Play that I loved when I reviewed it last year.. One of the primary selling points of the Life One X3 is the huge 5,000 mAh battery it contains. This phone will go all day and then some. With average use, the phone can easily reach two days without a recharge. Even heavy users will get a full day out of it, easily. It’s pretty amazing that the phone includes such a big power pack in such a sleek device.. The phone ships with Android 7.0 and if you don’t expect an OS upgrade you won’t be disappointed. BLU’s software load has gotten much better in recent years. The default launcher is Launcher 3, sort of a vanilla version of the old Google Home Launcher. It works well here, and of course can be replaced easily if desired.. Some customizations include swiping up from the bottom of the screen to get to an iPhone-like control center, a slightly reorganized settings app, the aforementioned MiraDisplay settings panel, and some small tweaks to the notification center. The phone isn’t running vanilla Android but it is close enough for me. I’m really pleased that BLU has abandoned heavy customization on their recent releases.. The camera is decent for this range of device. It boasts 13 MP shooters on the front and back, both with LED flash. It takes decent enough photos in well-lit environments, struggles in low-light. There are some nice configuration options like the ability to capture in RAW, electronic stabilization, and more.. The Life One X3 combines decent performance, excellent battery life, and a sleek design into a $149 (for a limited time) package that is better than a phone at that price has a right to be. If you are tired of spending $600 or more on a flagship phone, you should take a look at the Life One X3.

BLU Life One X3 Review: Stock Android & A Monster-Sized Battery. December 19, 2017 - Written By Alexander Maxham. The Life One X3 has enough juice to keep it going for days at a time, something everyone is going to love!. BLU is a company in the US that has an interesting history. It has always released smartphones that are very cheap, we’re talking under $250 most of the time. We’ve taken a look at a good number of their devices in recent years, and now the company is back with another smartphone in the Life One X3. This is being marketed as a smartphone with a monster battery, which it does indeed have a monster battery in the form of a 5000mAh battery pack inside. But that’s not enough to get people to buy a phone. So is the Life One X3 worth your money? Let’s find out.. Win A OnePlus 5T Bundle With OnePlus & AndroidHeadlines – International Giveaway/ Contest, Enter Today!. The BLU Life One X3 sports a 5.5-inch full HD display, at 1920×1080 resolution that gives us a pixel density of 400ppi. The glass is also curved, which we’ll explain a bit more later on. Powering the Life One X3 is the MediaTek MT6753, which is an octa-core 1.3GHz processor with the Mali-T720 GPU inside. There is 3GB of RAM included here, with 32GB of storage, and a micro SD card slot for expanding storage, should you need more space.. For optics, there is a 13-megapixel sensor on the back, and a 13-megapixel front-facing shooter. Both of them have a flash with them, so you’ll get nice selfies even in low-lit places like bars and such. It can also record video at up to 1080p and 30 frames-per-second. Other connectivity options here include WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.0, as well as a micro USB port for charging the device. There is a fingerprint sensor on the front for authentication as well. Finally, the BLU Life One X3 is powered by a fairly large 5,000mAh battery inside.. Inside the box with the BLU Life One X3, the company has included all of the usual items. So you get a clear silicon case for the BLU Life One X3, a screen protector, a wall adapter and a micro USB cable. Of course, there is the usual assortment of paperwork included in the box, as is the case with every smartphone.. The Life One X3 does have a metal backside, which not only looks good, but it feels good in the hand as well. The Life One X3 does also have a slightly curved back, which really helps to make it feel good in the hand. It is available in black, which looks pretty stealthy. Now since there is such a large battery inside the Life One X3, there is no camera bump on this one. It’s mostly flush with the back of the device, which is really nice to see. It’s something that most customers would rather have, is a slightly thicker phone with a larger battery, over having a camera bump on the back.. Now BLU will say that the display is curved on the Life One X3, which is actually true, but it’s only curved at the edges, to melt into the metal back of the Life One X3. So it is technically curved, but it’s not going to change how you use the phone like a device such as the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy Note 8. The corners of the actual display are not curved either, and it’s still a 16:9 aspect ratio device.. On the sides of the device, you’ll find the power button and volume rocker on the right-hand side, with the SIM card slot on the left. The SIM card slot is actually pretty interesting, it’s a dual SIM card slot with a micro SD card slot, so you have three slots in the tray, which is really nice to have. On the bottom of the device, you’ll find the micro USB port, as well as a speaker and a microphone. The top is where you’ll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, luckily, BLU did decide to keep that this time around, while many others are getting rid of the headphone jack.. The display here on the BLU Life One X3 is still a full HD display. And while most other smartphones are using a QHD panel these days, 1080p is still quite good, after all there is a pixel density of 400ppi, which is still quite high. And going with a 1080p display means BLU can charge less for this phone, while also providing even better battery life than with a QHD panel. So it’s a good decision, all in all.. This panel is not the best one out there, but it’s also not the worst one we’ve seen. It does get very, very bright. That is something you don’t see a lot on smartphones in this price range. Sure, many would rather see it a bit more saturated than it is, thanks to the OLED panels out there being so saturated lately. But there’s not much to complain about here. Now it does appear to be a tiny bit cool. But don’t worry, you are able to change up the color of the display thanks to MiraVision support in the settings. We did do most of this review in the “Vivid” mode, which does look a bit better than the “Standard” that it ships with as default.. Performance, is not really that great. Now when we look at the spec sheet, that is a bit expected. It’s sporting an octa-core 1.3GHz processor from MediaTek, with 3GB of RAM. Although, other processors that are clocked at this speed are not as slow as this phone is. It can become very slow, I’ve had it freeze up quite a few times while in the Play Store, just trying to download my apps and get the phone set up. Which is a pretty big problem. And throughout the review process, it didn’t get much better. In fact, one big example is long-pressing home to get to Google Assistant. You long-press home and nothing happens, until you give up and think “oh maybe it doesn’t have Google Assistant in the home button”, then it’ll popup and start Assistant. We also had quite a few times where the Google Assistant would randomly popup and start listening for a command. Very weird, and hopefully something BLU can fix in a software update.. When it comes to gaming, you should probably pass, unless it’s a light title that doesn’t need a lot of power. If the BLU Life One X3 can barely handle running through your everyday apps, it’s very unlikely that it will do well with a game or two. So you’re better off not gaming on this phone, unfortunately.. Much like the performance section of this review, the fingerprint sensor has its fair share of issues. It’s the only fingerprint sensor I’ve used on a smartphone this year that has had issues with recognizing my fingerprint. Most smartphones have no issue recognizing fingerprints these days, and are really fast, almost instant. The one here on the Life One X3 is neither fast nor accurate. It’s quite slow, and it’s actually a bit confusing. It will vibrate when it recognizes your finger and when you need to try again, so if you don’t have the screen on already, it can be very confusing. It’s pretty sad, BLU probably should have dropped the fingerprint sensor here. However, with this being the sensor, BLU is able to send out a software update and fix it, make it faster, more accurate. So fingers crossed that happens sooner rather than later.. The BLU Life One X3 is a GSM unlocked smartphone, so it’ll work on AT&T, Cricket, T-Mobile, MetroPCS and any other MVNO’s that use either AT&T or T-Mobile’s network in the US, as well as most carriers around the globe. It’s also a dual SIM phone, so you can pop two SIMs inside and switch between them pretty easily. The Life One X3 also supports most bands in the US, even when it comes to LTE, as you can see below.. 3G GSM: 850, 900, 1700, 1900, 2100. 4G LTE: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 17, 28. We’ve been using the Life One X3 on T-Mobile’s network during the review process, and it’s worked out pretty well. It garnered about the same speeds as other devices running on T-Mobile’s network in the same area, so no surprises when it comes to speed. And phone calls went off without a hitch as well. No dropped calls around here, which is nice to see as well. However, the Life One X3 does not support HD Voice, VoLTE or WiFi Calling. Not really a surprise since the majority of unlocked smartphones do not support those technologies, but still worth noting.. Now the issues we have had in terms of networks has been with WiFi. The BLU Life One X3 will randomly stop connecting to a WiFi network, or it’ll connect and say it has “no internet,” or (and this is my favorite part) it’ll say there is an authentication problem even though it was just connected to that network with that password. Now a restart of the phone has fixed this for us, but this shouldn’t be happening, it should be staying connected to the WiFi network. Hopefully this is also just a bug that BLU can fix soon enough.. The speaker here is on the bottom of the phone, to the right of the micro USB port. BLU did not opt to use the earpiece as a second speaker, so you’re stuck with just that one. Which is unfortunate, because when holding the phone in landscape mode, you may cover the speaker and the sound will be muffled, and sometimes you won’t get any sound at all. Speaking of sound though, the sound on this smartphone is very tinny. It does not really sound good at all. It does get fairly loud, but it sounds like it’s coming from a tin can, which does not sound good, and should not be a thing in 2017. The sound is better when it comes to the headphone jack, but there’s no DAC in this phone, so the sound quality there is all dependent on the type of headphones you have plugged in (which we had the Sony WH-1000X M2’s plugged in, so we would likely get great audio regardless).. On the Life One X3, we ran AnTuTu, 3D Mark and Geekbench 4 for benchmarks, to see how the phone would perform. And the numbers were actually about where we expected, given the specs that this phone has. On AnTuTu, it scored a 39,415, which put it in last place, but we also have to remember that most of the phones on that list are sporting flagship specs like the Snapdragon 835. Over on 3D Mark, it picked up a score of 208, which is actually fairly decent, but gaming still isn’t going to be very enjoyable on this phone. Finally on Geekbench 4, it picked up a single-core score of around 615 and a multi-core score of 2335. As always, you can see the full results in the gallery below for all three benchmarks.. There’s a 5000mAh battery inside the Life One X3, and common sense would lead you to believe that it has some pretty impressive battery life. But it appears that the software is not completely optimized to really take advantage of that large battery. Particularly when it comes to standby times. The Life One X3 was able to lose a good 6-8% of its battery overnight (about 8 hours), which is quite a bit of battery, considering other phones like the Pixel 2 XL and even the Moto G5S Plus, are closer to around 1-2% over the same period. But when you are using the phone, it does last quite a long time. We were able to get around 3 hours of screen on time in a single day, and that was still with 51% of its battery left. That was after a full day of use, so the phone will last you a good two days, if not a bit more depending on how you use it.. With a 5000mAh battery powering this phone, this means it’s going to take longer to charge than something with a 3000mAh battery, which is true. Especially since this does not have Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0, largely since it does not use a Qualcomm chipset. But it does have a form of fast charging, which isn’t that fast in 2017. It can support up to 2.4A out of the box, which is somewhat fast, it’s about on par with Quick Charge 2.0. And with a 2.4A power adapter, you’re able to fully charge this phone in just under 3 hours. Still quite a long time, but you do have to remember that there is such a large battery pack in this one, so it does make sense that it takes much longer.. At the time of reviewing the BLU Life One X3, the phone is running on Android 7.0 Nougat with the September 5, 2017 security patch. That is a fairly old security patch for a phone that has just launched in December 2017. But it is still newer than most other phones on the market, for what it’s worth. Now, we do need to talk updates. BLU does not typically send out updates to its phones, and when it does, it’s usually only for its most popular devices. Since we typically stop using these phones after the review period, it’s hard to say how often or how many updates the Life One X3 will get, but don’t get your hopes up for regular updates for the next 2-3 years. BLU has not said whether or not this is going to get Android Oreo either.. Although it should get Oreo, because this is essentially a build of AOSP slapped onto this hardware. There are very few changes in the Life One X3’s software from AOSP. Which isn’t always a bad thing, but it gives a company less excuses for updating. Many would love to have a great phone with great battery life and stock Android. Which the Life One X3 does apparently tick two of those boxes. The software here on the Life One X3 has a few apps installed, other than the usual Google apps. Of course the Amazon app is here, since BLU does have that agreement with Amazon. There’s also “BLU Help” which is a customer support app to help you out in case you having issues with your phone. Definitely a nice app to have installed on this phone. There’s also Empire, Yahoo Newsroom, NextRadio, Amazon Prime Video, Protect and Yahoo Sports. The Protect app is an app that will measure and save your mobile data, and it does need permission for apps usage. This is one you’ll likely want to remove from the phone when you get it. There’s really no need for this when you have data usage built-in.. Despite being pretty plain, the software here actually works just as you’d expect. The software itself is pretty smooth on the Life One X3, although there are some hiccups here and there when doing different things. Like we mentioned in the performance section, Google Assistant does appear to randomly start up and listen for a command from you, which is really odd. But otherwise, there’s not a lot to complain about here, though it would be nice if the software were a bit faster. Now you can adjust this a bit by shortening the animations in the software, under developer settings, but this only helps a tiny bit.. The camera needs some help, to be honest here. There are times where auto focus will take the subject from being in focus and make it out of focus then snap the picture. Which is really the opposite of what it should be doing, to be honest. There’s also no manual mode here, so you can’t move it to manual focus, or adjust shutter and ISO on the pictures you’re taken. It’s really a plain camera app and experience here. There are a total of four modes for the camera. There’s the regular auto mode, a QR mode, Panorama, and HDR. As you’d expect, HDR mode is quite slow to capture the photo, and to make it worse, there’s not much of a difference in pictures taken in HDR versus without HDR. So for most people with this phone, do yourself a favor and keep it on auto – also change the preview to 4:3 otherwise you’ll be shooting with 9-megapixels instead of the full 13-megapixels.. The actual images coming out of this camera actually aren’t too bad. Sure there are smartphones that can provide a much better picture, but these are still good enough for social media and such. Of course things look much better when you’re outside with sunlight helping you out. But even in relatively low light, it does surprisingly well. As always, you can see examples from our time with the phone in the gallery below.. WiFi disconnecting and not reconnecting (even manually). Google Assistant randomly popping up (like those pop up ads that used to plague the web). This review probably sounded pretty negative, but it is honest. There are a lot of issues with the BLU Life One X3 that shouldn’t be issues in 2017. Now luckily, a lot of these issues can be fixed with software updates, so hopefully BLU is able to get some software updates out to fix these things – particularly the fingerprint sensor and the camera, unfortunately the performance may not get much better even with software. Now the Life One X3 isn’t going. to win “Phone of the Year” for 2017, but it’s still a pretty good value for those that need something to make phone calls and don’t want to spend a fortune.. Should you buy the BLU Life One X3?. That’s a pretty tough question, there’s a lot of problems with the Life One X3, but if you’re one that just needs a phone to make calls, reply to texts, browse the web and such, then the Life One X3 is likely a good phone for you. But if you’re a heavy user and are tempted by that 5000mAh battery inside, you may not have a good time here.. Deal: Anker SoundBuds Slim Wireless Headphones for $17.99 w/ Code – 12/19/17.

Catastrophic BLU Life One X2 bug is finally fixed, Life One X3 quietly unveiled. Adrian Diaconescu December 5, 2017 4:57 am. As much as people in the US have taken to low-cost unlocked smartphones from local vendor BLU Products in recent years, no one expected great software support for ultra-affordable devices like the Life One X2 .. But even absolutely no updates are preferable to an OS makeover effort that ends up with users locked out of their phones , trying to guess a password they never set up in the first place.. If you somehow resisted the temptation of performing a factory reset for almost a week, caring too much about files stored internally on your BLU Life One X2, the official silence has finally been broken.. An “urgent” announcement on BLU’s Twitter feed is supposed to make everything right again, asking users affected by the tragic software glitch to send (nonobscene) emails at [email. A new update will be provided to fix the issues caused by the previous one and “grant you access to your device”, although if you’ve already done the aforementioned Factory Reset or exceeded the amount of permitted pin attempts, you shouldn’t bother trying to get in touch with customer support.. Instead, you could always upgrade to a brand-new BLU Life One X3. Yes, that’s a real thing, and it was launched with zero fanfare sometime in the recent past. The “buy now” button on the company’s official website doesn’t do anything, so technically, the “monster” battery-packing 5.5-incher is not up for grabs just yet.. But clearly, BLU intends to go about its business before long, not even deeming the Life One X brand compromised by this embarrassing scandal. For those that like to gamble, the One X3 doesn’t look half bad on paper, featuring a truly gigantic 5,000mAh battery, Full HD curved display, 3GB RAM, 13MP rear and 13MP front camera, as well as fingerprint recognition. Also, Android 7.0 Nougat out the box, which you’ll probably want to keep intact if ever given the choice to “update.”. BLU Products (official website) BLU Products (Twitter).

Charging system 5V/2A Quick Charge General Specs Sequel to BLU Life One X2 Other features Fingerprint detector Yes Finish Aluminum housing. The BLU Life One X3 sports large 6.43-inch AMOLED display that has a desirably-uncommon (as of its release) 18:9 aspect ratio, but scores a disgusting 376ppi, and it features two high-resolution rear-facing cameras, one 20-megapixel cam designed for nigh-time shooting and a 16-megapixel one for regular shots in daylight. That being said, it joins its R11s sibling as one of only a handful of 2017 smartphones to rock selfie shooters whose resolutions go up to 20 megapixels or higher.. Although its relatively-slow 1.3GHz eight-core CPU is a slight turn-off, the Life One X3's 5000mAh power cap and dual 13-megapixel cameras make this mid-ranger hard to ignore.
