Press enter or click on the search icon. Page 1 BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9981. Trails the competition on almost all technical fronts. BlackBerry OS 7.0 is nice but limited. Adapters for all plug types included. Designer phones seldom live up to expectations, as they tend to be expensive simply for the sake of it. Buy a Porsche 911 or a Rolls Royce and you not only get a car that’s beautifully made, you get better performance and better features than your average motor. Not so with posh phones, though. They tend to offer only as much, and often less, than the best ‘normal’ phones with only a bit of bling to make up for the extra cost.. So, can the BlackBerry P’9981 crafted by Porsche Design break this trend?. Well, dealing with that all important design first, the P’9981 (or P9981 if you like) certainly ticks most of the right boxes. Tough steel and glass dominate the front while the back is covered in soft black leather. The design is perhaps a bit utilitarian and lacking in true bling but it’s also classy, and clearly a cut above.. The fit and finish is also better than most. The sand blasted steel feels great while touches like the etched Porsche Design logo above the screen and ‘P’9981’ on the back, are perfectly executed. There’s not a hint of flex or give to the body, despite a removable backplate (we had no issues with the backplate coming loose as others have reported), and all told you feel like you’re gripping something that rightly costs that bit more.. It’s a bit heavier than the Bold 9900 on which its based, with a weight of 155g compared to 130g, and it’s a little larger too with dimensions of 115 x 66 x 10.5 mm vs 115 x 67 x 11.3 mm but it’s actually an easy device to handle thanks to that leather finish giving a firm comfortable grip and the buttons and controls being well placed. In particular the screen lock button on the top edge and the full expanse of the screen are both easy to reach, as are all the navigation buttons and keyboard. The volume keys on the right edge also fall easily under finger or thumb, along with the play/pause button that sits between them. The only issue is that they’re a bit small, so aren’t that easy to press with the phone still in your pocket.. There is one potentially major slip up, though. Each of the navigation buttons is a little square of glass that looks pretty snazzy. But, as well as having a slight wobble that large buttons of that type often have, they’re also prone to being damaged. You see, both these buttons and the keyboard buttons run right to the edge of the phone where they’re susceptible to being knocked. This had clearly already happened to our review sample before it arrived to us as the power button (the right most one) sits slightly awkwardly and can easily be prised up further than it should.. The screen, also, has a bit less visual pizzazz than we’d hope for. It’s kind-of understandable that the display is no bigger than that of the Bold 9900 but given the extra cost and extra girth of this phone, a bigger, bolder display would’ve been nice. As it is you get a 2.8in LCD panel with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. This is a high pixel count for a screen this size but it’s still not exactly iPhone-rivalling..

Great form factor...Feels great in your hand! The software could be a little bit more stable with android apps and faster loading times it would be a GREAT 10/10 Phone. The touch screen is Vibrant and accurate! Has better camera than an iphone 5S Clear at some points but in darkness could be clearer. If this only recieved android it would be an exclusive phone with a HEFTY price tag on it! ANDROID IT BLACKBERRY! THE DEMAND IS THERE! Overall the Android Emulator is unstable and needs to be worked on. The apps are laggy at times and crashes once in awhile. But when they do load they operate GREAT and SMOOTH! Emojis can be seen but it needs a Keyboard with Emojis! You can install one through android but it only works in android apps Visual Voicemail Supported as well h aven't used it as of yet because my service provider does not support it. But its great for chatting in the hub everything is clear. The Assistant app could be faster as well as Talk to Text feature. But im overall satisfied with the phone catered to Business! Read full review. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned. by $$$noobject Dec 23, 2014. The Blackberry Porsche is technological elegance at it's best.. The Blackberry Porsche 9981 is undoubtedly the most elegant phone I have ever owned and I own them all! I bought this phone strictly for it's eye appeal, but I was surprised at how responsive and fast it is. Although the apps are limited, other app stores can be sideloaded to make it more competetive with other high end phones and compared to previous Blackberrys, it is in it's own category. I also own the newer version, the Blackberry Porsche 9982 with the newer OS and it too has it's own individual appeal. Overall, if you are looking for a phone that's unique and very high quality, this may be for you. Don't misunderstand, I do not carry these phones everyday... they are like tuxedos, you use them occasionally, as I feel they are far too expensive for mundane tasks. Still, I'm ve ry pleased with this phone and it garners alot of compliments... I will own all of the Blackberry Porsches! Read full review. Superior phone made with top quality materials!. I bought this phone because I have used Blackberry phones for the last 7 years and own a Porsche. If you like quality and want to be different from everyone else, this phone is for you! Most people have never seen or even heard about this cool phone. I wish it had the latest BB10 software although overall I'm satisfied. It is the high luxury version of the BB 9900 so if you like that phone and have the dough for this one, you will love it!. This phone, has the same spec, as Blackberry 9900,it is complete the same phone, without the porshe design. So, if you will save $ 1.900.- buy a Blackberry 9900.. If you`re desperate for design, and attention, buy the Blackberry Porshe design.. very pleasant application is very good, we make it easy to find friends th. very pleasant and sociable application is very good, we make it easy to find friends through social media.

It's hard not to feel like "the man" walking around with the P'9981. Most people have never seen one in real life. Take it out in public and people notice it. Those who recognize it and know of the Porsche BlackBerry look at you in awe (or like you're crazy to spend $2k on a phone). Those who don't know of the P'9981 stop and ask what is as they're seeing it for the first time. Owning the P'9981 turns you into a celebrity of sorts. Seriously, people will want to stop you and take photos of you and your phone. It's a very different sort of smartphone ownership experience. When you buy a P'9981, you really feel like you're joining an elite club.. As the price tag goes up so do the expectations. Unfortunately, there are a few frustrating flaws/oversights on the P'9981 that bug me. Uneven keyboard backlighting jumps out at you in the dark. Removing the microSD card is tricky as is replacing the battery door. The Call / Hang Up buttons have open edges, and I've almost accidentally ripped those buttons off the phone when pulling the phone out of my pocket more than once. Software updates/leaks lag the 9900, which is annoying at the moment as the P'9981 needs an upgrade to OS 7.1. And yes, like the Bold 9900, there's no autofocus on the camera. You don't look at review ratings on a phone like the P'9981. With a $2k price tag, this is a luxury item. You're buying it because you already like the BlackBerry experience and you want it in the most exclusive manner possible and don't mind the expense that accompanies it. Comparisons to other BlackBerry phones or competitors on the market just don't matter.. The Porsche Design P'9981 from BlackBerry Review. BlackBerry P'9981 Appearance, Form Factor, Build Quality. When the first photos of the P'9981 emerged on the internet back on September 9th of 2011, nobody knew what to think of them. Overall the phone had the look of a BlackBerry, complete with a BlackBerry logo above the display. At the same time, the phone looked like no other BlackBerry on the market, and the word PROCEEDING inscribed into the top front of the casing seemed odd. Was this an unfinished hardware prototype of a next-generation QNX BlackBerry that was still running the old BlackBerry OS? Or maybe it was somebody's elaborate mod job to a 9900? We were all confused, to say the least.. It took the CrackBerry team barely 24 hours to get to the bottom of it, and the next day we posted that the device was absolutely legit , was codenamed "BlackBerry Knight" and was actually a collaboration between Porsche Design and BlackBerry to create an exclusive BlackBerry offering. Less than two months later on October 27th, Research In Motion officially unveiled the Porsche Design P'9981 Smartphone from BlackBerry in Dubai.. Based on the BlackBerry Bold 9900 hardware platform and running on the BlackBerry 7 operating system, the phone would go to market with an incredibly long product name -- Porsche Design P Ninety Nine Eighty One Smartphone from BlackBerry -- to match the incredibly steep $2,000 price tag. The phone first became available overseas and is now available in North America. Don't call your carrier looking for the P'9981. It is only available from Porsche Design stores ( see locations ).. In late February both me and my better half (Miss CrackBerry) started using the P'9981, both moving over to it from the Bold 9900. I wasn't in a rush to get this review posted. With demand for the phone relatively low and with a price tag as high it is, I'd rather post my thoughts on it once I've really put it to use for a month, including a couple of weeks spent roaming on different carriers while traveling.. The P'9981 isn't a new BlackBerry so much as it is a new skin for the BlackBerry Bold 9900 we all know and love. From the 1.2GHz Qualcomm processor/chipset to the 640x480 resolution touchscreen display to the location of all the buttons and ports and even the camera location, the P'9981 is basically a 9900 stripped down to its guts and fitted into a new chassis with different trimmings all around. The most notable hardware configuration change is actually the location of the microSD card slot under the battery door cover, which has been flipped around so it doesn't pull out and get jammed into the battery as it did with the Bold 9900 ( I wonder if RIM made this change because of my issues with it ).. That said, the 9900 really does look nothing like the P'9981. Within the context of keeping the device hardware configuration the same as the Bold 9900, RIM and Porsche Design essentially changed everything they could to give the P'9981 its own unique look and design language. As you might suspect with a phone so closely built upon another, performance of the P'9981 matches that of the 9900 in pretty much all areas.. The appearance of the P'9981 is polarizing. People seem to either absolutely love it or completely hate it. Every article we've written about the P'9981 to date here on CrackBerry has been accompanied by user comments that range from "this is still the fugliest BlackBerry I've ever seen" to "oh my gawd that's hot, I NEED IT NOW." One thing I have also noticed is that the P'9981 gets better reactions when people see it in person - pictures don't quite do the phone justice.. While the design influence is that of Porsche Design, most initial reactions compare the P'9981 to an old school calculator. I've also heard references to Bang and Olufsen's designs from the 80's and that it also looks like a phone Marty McFly should have been using to go with Doc's DeLorean. Mixed in with its industrial design, the P'9881 definitely falls into that category of futuro - futuristic and retro styling combined.. While initially I wasn't completely sold on the P'9981's design, it has grown on me. I consider my BlackBerry to be a communication and productivity tool, and the look of the P'9981 represents that well. There's a ruggedness about it that screams I get sh!t done .. While the aesthetics are up for debate, one thing that isn't is the P'9981's ability to draw attention. Everywhere I go, people notice the P'9981. Especially when out at restaurants with the P'9981 on the table, a meal doesn't go by without the server commenting on it (I guess in the service industry you see a lot of phones everyday, so when something new and different pops up it really grabs your attention). Heck, on a recent trip to the USA, Miss CrackBerry was using her P'9981 while sitting by the gate at the airport and she kept getting stopped by people to pose for photos with her phone - people were all over this crazy-looking BlackBerry.. One of the expensive hardware components of the P'9981 that also gives a foundation to the design is the stainless steel frame upon which the phone is built. The unibody frame has been milled out of a single piece of metal, which makes the device extremely sturdy and also contributes to the phone's additional heft. The P'9981 weights in at a meaty 155 grams / 5.47 oz, compared to the Bold 9900 at 130 grams / 4.59 oz.. Looking at the device from the front, you can visually see the steel frame at the top of the phone, where it is engraved with the Porsche Design name. Below that is the display area, which contains the touchscreen display as well as the notification LED.. Below the display the Porsche Design BlackBerry takes a linear approach to the navigation buttons and keyboard vs. The call / end / menu / back and optical trackpad functions are mounted on rectangle-shaped buttons in a straight line. The trackpad really struck me as being different from any other BlackBerry trackpad to date - on the P'9981 it takes the form of cross hairs, which is very unique and really jumps out.. Below the navigation buttons is the keyboard, which again is a lot different than the Bold 9900's. The keyboard is laid across four straight rows that are set into the unibody frame, each row of keys divided by a space. The bottom corners are indented, which is where alternate characters are shown, but the indentation is preceded with a raised line. Looking at the phone in the photo above, you clearly the get impression that the keyboard has treads, just like that of a car tire. It's a not so subtle design that ties in the Porsche Design theme of the phone. In this review you can find photos that show off both the standard P'9981 keyboard, but also the Arabic version, which adds the additional characters to the top right corner of each key.. What I don't like is the sloppiness around this part of the phone. On the row of navigation buttons, you can really feel the edges, both between each button and between the top of the buttons and display. Also, the sides of both the call and hang up buttons are exposed. With the Bold 9900, these keys are mounted within the frame, so the edges of the buttons are not visible from the outside of the phone. On the P'9981, you can literally stick your fingernail under the edge of the call and hang up buttons, being able to literally pop them off if you wanted to. Pulling the phone out of my front jeans pocket, on more than one occasion I've snagged the button and nearly ripped it off the phone. Likewise, on the keyboard, I've found the backlighting to be inconsistent. Some of the letters glow more brightly than others in the dark, for no apparent reason. I found this to be really sloppy and annoying, which if anything exudes a form of cheapness vs. the luxury I'm expecting out of a $2,000 phone. Take note, I found this backlighting issue to be a problem on both P'9981s I reviewed.. Below the keyboard, the "chin" of the P'9981 has an angular design, which slots in beautifully to the charging stand that comes with the P'9981 in the box. Overall, the phone is a little bit longer than the 9900.. The back of the P'9981 actually brings back memories of the original Bold 9000, where the battery door cover was literally the entire backside of the phone. With the P'9981 the door is a soft touch rubber, which provides a nice grip and has a pattern reminiscent of a grained leather. If anything, it comes across a bit like the material you'd expect on the dashboard of a car - another tie-in to the Porsche Design theme.. Removing and replacing the battery door is a little bit tricky. The door is held on by a pressure fit against almost invisible clips. You have to pry the door off the phone - start from the bottom with your finger nail in the speaker port gap at the middle bottom of the phone. When replacing the door, start at the top and start placing pressure down the phone to have it snap back in place. On one of the P'9981s reviewed, I found one of the bottom corners never liked to snap in nicely, though it would work its way closed. In over a month of use I never ran into any issues with the battery door falling off or accidentally becoming dislodged, which is good. So while the door isn't nearly as user friendly as the 9900's, it does the job with style.. Also visible from the back of the phone is the camera and flash, which are surrounded by a metal badge which features the P'9981 brand.. Working around the perimeter of the device, both top and bottom of the P'9981 are kept very clean. Similar to the 9900, there is single, centrally-mounted button on the top that wakes the P'9981 and puts it to sleep.. On both sides of the angular bottom of the P'9981 are the charging contacts for P'9981's charging stand. These really jump out at you, as a portion of the frame has been cut away to expose the contact pins. There is also a small gap in the bottom of the phone, which has been cut out as a speaker port - this is where sound escapes the phone when using the speaker phone or listening to music, etc.. The right side of the P'9981 is busy, featuring the volume up / down / mute keys as well as the right side convenience key.. The left side of the P'9981 is very clean. Exposed near the top is the 3.5mm headset port, and below that is the microUSB port for charging and syncing.. Looking at the Porsche Design BlackBerry from the side you really get a sense of the unibody frame construction. Notice in the photo below how the display and keyboard are clearly inset into the frame. As mentioned above, the exposed edges of the talk / end buttons concerns me a bit, but overall you can't argue with this somewhat unfinished industrial look. Comparing the Porsche Design P'9981 to the Bold 9900 side by side, you really get a sense of just how different yet how similar the two phones are. The locations of critical buttons and ports and the display and LED are basically identical, yet between all of that the housing and finishing details are very different.. The Bold 9900 is more compact and in my opinion, more elegant, taking advantage of curves everywhere while retaining that iconic BlackBerry look. The P'9981 features more straight lines and a more utilitarian look. When I think of Porsche cars, which are curvy and beautiful, I feel the 9900 might actually be the better representation. The P'9981 almost has the feeling of a Hummer - it's bigger and boxier with a rougher finish to the look. Of course we're talking Porsche Design here, not Porsche cars, and Porsche Design has their own clear design language which the P'9981 adheres to.. With the battery doors removed, keen eyes will note the configuration change that was made to the P'9981 under the hood. The position of the microSD card was flipped so it no longer ejects into the battery as it did on the 9900 (with the 9900 you have to take out your battery to swap the microSD card). A great change, though on both my P'9981s I have found it slightly difficult to remove the SD card. It's spring loaded so you press on it and it easily ejects half way. From there you should be able to just slide it out, but there's a slight lip on the housing that can catch the card. A little light pressure applied away from the phone tends to overcome this. It's not a big deal once you figure it out. Just take note, if you're having trouble removing the microSD card, don't force it - look at it and remove it with some care..

Other Internals - BlackBerry P'9981 Bluetooth, WiFi , GPS and Other Sensors. Porsche Design P'9981 from BlackBerry Hardware Wrap-Up. BlackBerry 7 OS on the Porsche Design P'9981. End of the day, the Porsche Design P'9981 is a conversation starter. Whether you love it or hate it, you can't help but notice it.. Like the BlackBerry Bold 9900, the Porsche Design P'9981 is running a Qualcomm Scorpion MSM 8655 processor clocked at 1.2GHz on the Snapdragon chipset. An Adreno 205 GPU (graphics processing unit) is also onboard, powering BlackBerry 7's hardware-accelerated graphics, which RIM has dubbed "liquid graphics." At 1.2GHz, the processing power is roughly double the speed of previous generation BlackBerry phones like the Bold 9700 and 9780. In addition to more speed, this hardware platform upgrade addressed a lot of the other nagging wants we've had for a while now, including 3D graphics support (has been lacking to date on GSM BlackBerrys) and HD video recording.. For the most part, the performance of the P'9981 has been really fast. I have noticed a few occasional slow downs, but I actually attribute them more to the version of the OS software on the P'9981 (my units came with 7.0.0.579) and running low on memory than to the processor (which we'll cover shortly). 1.2GHz on the BlackBerry OS is ample.. The Porsche Design P'9981 features a 2.8-inch (diagonal) 24-bit touchscren display running VGA at 640 x 480 pixels. Pixel density works out to 287 pixels per inch. Like the BlackBerry Bold 9900's display, the P'9981's display is really nice. Colors are crisp and vivid, and the display is bright - even at the default 70 percent setting. According to RIM the display is made of "extra hardened glass," so there's no plastic here.. The only real complaint anybody can have with the P'9981's display is the overall size. When you put a full physical keyboard on the front of a phone, it comes with the trade off of leaving less room to fit a display. If you mainly use your phone for communication purposes then a 2.8" display is fine, but activities like web browsing will have you wishing for a bigger display. The good news is that if you can afford the P'9981, you can also afford to buy a secondary device, like a PlayBook or iPad or iPod touch to go along with the P'9981. The P'9981 is the best communication tool on the planet - use it for that, and put the games and movies onto your other device and you'll have the best of both worlds.. The BlackBerry Bold 9900's keyboard is STILL the greatest keyboard to ever be put on a smartphone, period. Anybody who argues otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about.. That said, the keyboard on the P'9981 is pretty good. Unless you actually compare it to the Bold 9900 side by side, you won't know that there's something out there even better. When I first used the P'9981, it was a pre-production prototype and on that particular unit I had difficulty on the keyboard - something with the bounce back on the keys didn't feel right. I was really worried that when it came time to review the P'9981 I'd be bashing the keyboard. But whatever RIM did between then and releasing the P'9981 fixed things up, as I've found the P'9981 great for typing.. Coming from the Bold 9900 to the P'9981 took some adjustment, both for me and Miss CrackBerry. We weren't quite as fast nor as accurate at the start. But a week or so later I was no longer missing the 9900's keyboard and the P'9981 felt like home. Though every now and then I pick up my 9900 again to type on it just for fun, and am still amazed by how good the 9900's keyboard feels.. The Porsche Design P'9981 ships with 768MB of RAM and has an additional 8GB of onboard memory for media storage. Additionally, there is an expansion slot that supports up to 32GB microSD cards. The phone comes with a 16GB card pre-installed. A nice touch, but I'll admit for $2,000 I was hoping for a 32GB.. Of the 768MB of RAM, a lot of it goes to powering the OS and liquid graphics. Application Storage free space will be around 200MB. As I type this right now I am sitting with about 90MB free. I've installed very few apps on my P'9981, but I get a TON of emails each day which tend to collect on the phone and eat up memory. On a couple of occasions now, when not paying attention, I've actually ran the phone out of memory just by having a really, really full inbox. When memory gets low the phone slows down. But wiping out the emails frees up all that space and it's quick again. I'm really looking forward to BlackBerry 10 phones - this type of issue will be a thing of the past.. Battery life on the P'9981 has been consistent compared to that of the Bold 9900, which is to say not as good as some BlackBerry Smartphones of the past, such as the Bold 9700. As long as I use WiFi when at home and at the office, I never find I have an issue with battery life. I'm out and about all day on 3G, then I'll find my battery gets eaten a lot more quickly (especially if I find myself in low coverage areas). On a recent trip to Miami, I actually put my phone on Edge for the week which really helped conserve battery life.. Whether the battery life is going to be enough for you will depend on usage. Miss CrackBerry has never had an issue lasting the day, but she mainly uses the phone for messaging and calls. To ensure you get the most out of your battery, be sure to check our article with 10 Tips to Maximize BlackBerry Battery Life .. I was worried that a phone with so much metal in it would drop a lot of calls, but the P'9981 has performed fine on the phone front. Call quality is good as is the speakerphone loudness and clarity. The microphone pickup is located on the front of the phone - it's a tiny little slit to the right of the caps key on the bottom row of the keyboard.. Audio quality out of the internal speaker was good. Cranking up the tunes to max volume, the sound quality didn't go all tinny and hollow. Again, if you can afford the P'9981 you can also afford some awesome headphones and speakers to hook up to the P'9981.. As we noted in our Bold 9900 review, one of the nice upgrades on the BlackBerry 7 hardware is the move from a 3.6Mbps modem to 14.4. The Porsche Design theme on the P'9981 shows a 3G connectivity icon instead of the H+ I normally see on my 9900, but the data speeds are equally fast.. My Saturday morning Cappuccino, made by Miss CrackBerry with love.. Like the Bold 9900, the P'9981 features a 5 megapixel EDOF (Extended Depth of Field) camera, which is to say that it lacks autofocus. This was a sacrifice RIM made on the Bold 9900 in order to make the it the thinnest BlackBerry yet, as the EDOF camera has a very thin footprint. While the continuous focus camera works well for the most part, unfortunately, the lack of autofocus can also makes close up shots extremely difficult. I often use my phone camera for taking shots of receipts or product labels, and not having autofocus has caused me to curse on many occassions with both the 9900 and now the P'9981. On the Bold 9900, the lack of autofocus was almost unforgivable. On a $2,000 phone, the lack of autofocus is laughable.. With that rant done, the P'9981 is capable of taking some beautiful photos, especially when ample lighting is present. The P'9981 can also record HD video at 720p (1280 x 720 resolution). The video recording quality is really solid.. The NFC antenna is built into the battery door of the P'9981. The P'9981 as it ships today is loaded with OS 7.0, not 7.1, but when it gets the upgrade to 7.1 (which RIM promises it will), the phone will have BlackBerry Tag preloaded. BlackBerry Tag allows you to put the NFC functionality of the P'9981 to work in a variety of ways. Check out the demo video below:. Bluetooth and WiFi are of course present on the P'9981, and everything is up to BlackBerry par. Bluetooth is version 2.1 and it does support stereo bluetooth (A2DP). WiFi connectivity is present in the form of Dual-Band Wi-Fi: 802.11 b/g/n at 2.4 GHz and 802.11 a/n at 5 GHz. Other sensors include GPS, an orientation sensor (accelerometer) and digital compass (magnetometer) that allow for augmented reality applications like Wikitude, which comes preloaded on the phone.. The best accessory for a Porsche Design phone is a real Porsche. One of the best and worst things about the P'9981 are the accessories. The best thing is that the P'9981 comes with some sweet accessories, including the best BlackBerry charging stand ever and cleaning cloth that is stamped with Porsche Design. The bad thing is, beyond what comes in the box, your selection is pretty limited. No case is included, which given the value of the phone I think a lot of P'9981 owners would be looking for (and no, cases for the 9900 don't fit the 9981). Likewise, I'd like to get another charging stand for the P'9981 so I could have one by my bed and one on my office desk, but I haven't been able to find one yet that I can buy. At ShopCrackBerry.com we do have lots of Porsche Design BlackBerry Acccessories , but not specific P'9981 ones yet (just the general stuff like batteries, bluetooth, etc.). I'm not near any Porsche Design stores to check if they're carrying any selection of accessories for the P'9981 beyond what comes in the box, but I hope they are.. Put it all together and the hardware story for the Porsche Design BlackBerry is pretty interesting. The guts are the same as the Bold 9900 as is the overall performance for the most part, but the external packaging is very different. The keyboard on the (cheaper) Bold 9900 is actually better, and the Bold 9900's design actually feels more polished and complete. The limited production and expensive materials (one piece steel frame) all drive the cost of the exclusive P'9981 up through the roof, turning it into a luxury item and collector's piece of sorts. From a tech standpoint the Bold 9900 is a better phone for less money, but for the people buying the P'9981 that really doesn't matter.. A $500 clock app on a $2000 BlackBerry. Beyond giving the P'9881 a distinct look from all other BlackBerry Smartphones, Research In Motion also customized the BlackBerry 7 software to give it a distinct Porsche Design feel.. The Porsche Design Theme and Wallpaper. The P'9981 comes with its own Porsche Design theme pre-installed by default. There's no disabling it to go back to the traditional default BlackBerry theme. With a lot of purple and green in it, the theme has a fun vibe and it's definitely usable. Like any new theme, it takes some getting used to the new icons in the P'9981 theme, which have a mix of predominant colors including blue, green and grey. The default wallpaper is a wavy background grid of purple and black. Speaking to that retro look of the hardware, this wallpaper matches it. I swear as a kid in grade four I had my school photos done on a similar backdrop.. The most expensive ringtone you'll ever own.. Another P'9981 OS touch was the inclusion of a Porsche Design ringtone, which again, has a bit of an 80's vibe to it. The only problem now is that both Miss CrackBerry and I feel the need to use it as our ringtone, so whenever we're in the same room and a phone rings, we're both reaching for our P'9981s. Maybe RIM could have included a few more Porsche Design ringtones. Porsche Design Ringtone by crackberry. The real icing on the Porsche Design BlackBerry software cake has to be the exclusive PIN associated with 9981 phones. All BlackBerry pins start with the numbers 2AA. So if you get a BlackBerry Messenger request from somebody with a 2AA, you know they're rocking the P'9981. Likewise, if somebody tries to tell you they have a P'9981 and their pin doesn't have a 2AA at the front, you know they're lying. The P'9981 even comes with an owners card in the box that declares it is an authentic device designed by BlackBerry and Porsche Design with the PIN printed on the card.. While I am a fan of all the customizations to the P'9981 that contribute to this feeling of exclusivity and being part of an elite owners club, I am not loving that the P'9981. takes a back seat in terms of software updates. While the BlackBerry Bold 9900 is officially on OS 7.1, the P'9981 is still stuck on OS 7.0.0.579, which is what it shipped with. In comparison, this P'9981 software is old and it's not nearly as good as the latest versions of the OS. Having used the Bold 9900 from its first builds up until the newest, the stability and speed (and functionality) of the OS has steadily improved along the way. Unfortunately, .579 is still pretty old, and it shows. Especially when roaming recently in the US on AT&T, I found the P'9981 to be out of sorts. Miss CrackBerry's 9981 has been really glitchy as of late too, with the touchscreen often not responding and then the trackpad not responding (then both work for a while, then go back to one or the other not responding). I've reached out to RIM and they have confirmed that 7.1 is coming to the P'9981. For those looking to buy a P'9981 now, just be aware that the whole experience is going to be that much better once the phone makes the leap up to 7.1.. I'm pretty sure most would-be P'9981 owners will be familiar with the BlackBerry OS and will be people who like the BlackBerry experience. As everybody knows, BlackBerry 10 is the next generation of BlackBerry that will bring a much more robust app experience and a whole new level of performance to the phones. The BlackBerry OS as it is today excels at communication and critical apps. It's not about talking about what the BlackBerry OS is currently missing. If you're buying this phone, it's because you love what the BlackBerry operating system excels at.. The P'9981 costs about the same as the Bold 9900, iPhone 4S and Galaxy Nexus combined.. The Porsche Design P'9981 Smartphone from BlackBerry. Is it worth the money? The answer to that question is a personal one that potential customers will have to decide for themselves.. Since you're reading my review and presumably want my opinion, here goes:. If you look at the P'9981 from the perspective of the BlackBerry experience it delivers, the answer is no. Taking the astronomical price tag out of the equation, the Bold 9900 is actually a better BlackBerry. The keyboard on the 9900 is better, the software updates come first which makes a noticeable difference in performance. I also suspect the Bold 9900 will actually hold up better over time, thanks to all the cases available for it and the fact that the physical buttons are better attached to the device.. Where the P'9981 trumps the Bold 9900 is in psychology and panache. The fact that you could buy a Bold 9900, iPhone 4S and Samsung Galaxy Nexus for the price of one P'9981 means you don't care about value. Yes, there are some really cool things about the P'9981. The styling is unique and the exclusive 2AA PIN is a cool concept. At the end of the day, however, you're buying the P'9981 because you want it and can afford it and you don't care what anybody else has to say on that matter.. As for me, I have sitting on my desk a P'9981 and a Bold 9900. While I know that the 9900 is already sporting OS 7.1, in the end, that is somehow less compelling than the feel of my P'9981 in my hand. - I'll be leaving my SIM card in the P'9981 and my BBMs will come from my 2AA PIN - because I can.. You feel like the man walking around with a $2,000 phone. Awesome packaging - it's like opening a luxury watch box. Great accessories included - best charging stand ever, branded battery and cleaning cloth a nice touch. The exclusive 2AA PIN is awesome - feels like you're in a P'9981 club with Jay Z and Beyonce. Steel frame construction gives the phone a nice weighted feeling. If you meet another person using a P'9981, you'll instantly be friends. It's really expensive, and despite the increased price isn't really better than the Bold 9900. Software updates lag that of the Bold 9900 - they'll come, but it's still on OS 7.0. Uneven keyboard back lighting feels a bit sloppy. Exposed edges on call and hang up keys pose a risk (accidental breakage). Tracking down accessories poses a challenge. Battery door a bit of a pain to remove and replace. Removing microSD card can be slightly tricky. Careers: Writer | Dev. 
'Papers, Please' official short film recreates the game's bleak tone. Watch Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked 2018 event right here!. We're live from MWC 2018 in Barcelona!. We're live from MWC 2018 in Barcelona!. You can’t buy an ethical smartphone today. BlackBerry's 'Jarvis' finds security flaws in connected cars. BlackBerry Mobile commits to "at least" two new phones in 2018. Research in Motion, regardless of how you may view its recent history or its long-term future , still has a stronghold on the corporate world. Its lineup of BlackBerry smartphones are known for great battery life, comfortable keyboards with intuitive shortcuts, top-notch native email and Enterprise clients and -- most important to businesses -- unrivaled security features. Sure, its influence is waning as competitors have caught up in some areas (and surpassed it in others), but there are plenty of companies that have clung to their CrackBerries and held on tight. RIM's been hard at work trying to regain lost momentum by introducing a series of new devices featuring its latest OS, BlackBerry 7 , and the BlackBerry Bold 9900 / 9930 series has been the star of the show so far. The problem is, it's not flashy enough. How is a C-level exec supposed to walk proudly on the golf course with a $300 (subsidized) phone? Talk about embarrassing. Have no fear, poor corporate top dog, luxury brand Porsche Design has come up with a solution: the $2,300 BlackBerry P'9981 , a Vertu-ized version of that lesser handset you wouldn't be caught dead using. The P'9981 is available only in the UK and the Middle East for now, so until the device arrives in the US this Spring, anyone who lives stateside will have to rely on retailers to import some in. Fortunately we got the hookup by our friends at Negri Electronics , who happily lent us one of the few handsets they have in stock. As a result, we're now able to discuss the real questions circling around such a Richie Rich smartphone: what in the blue blazes makes this so expensive? Is it even worth it? How different is it from a standard BlackBerry Bold 9900? You'll find these answers and plenty of mysteries unravelled after the break.. BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9981 hits FCC. Gallery: BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9981 overview | 54 Photos. Offers same performance as Bold 9900. Keyboard isn't as easy to use as Bold 9900. The P'9981 is little more than a luxury BlackBerry Bold 9900, and will appeal only to a select few.. Hardware Handsets that cost more than two grand -- the Nokia Oro , Tag Hauer Link Phone , Motorola Aura and anything Vertu come to mind -- aren't meant to be blockbusters. In fact, most are purely intended to be sold as limited editions, with only a small number rolling off the production line. Porsche Design decided to follow the same strategy, and the company paired up with RIM to craft a new masterpiece using some of the finest materials lying around. The brand's choice of manufacturer may come as a surprise to many, given the company's recent rocky history, but it shouldn't. After all, Porsche Design CEO Juergen Gessler and several of the executive underlings use a BlackBerry as their daily driver. It's only natural, then, that if they were going to begin selling premium smartphones through their very own stores, they'd buddy up with their favorite phone maker to make it happen, right? Gessler met with RIM to inquire about a collaboration, and boom -- the rest is history. Let's begin digging into what will interest the business elite -- the phone's design and hardware. First off, we'll need to answer the first burning question: does the P'9981's cost have anything to do with functionality? After all, a device that costs that much should certainly do our laundry for us, right? Nope. Walk our dogs ? Strike three. The use of "fine materials," as well as the limited production and eye candy factor, all contribute to the sky-high costs, and it has absolutely nothing with what you can do with it. But then again, if functionality is all you're looking for, you can find that just as easily in top-notch mainstream devices for less than $700 unlocked. In the case of the P'9981, stamping the Porsche Brand logo across the top is what draws curious eyes (and wallets). We'll offer a disclaimer here: when mentioning that the P'9981 is eye candy, allow us to point out that we're not smitten with its looks, per se. However, there's no question it's an artfully made piece. Porsche and RIM appeared to put a solid amount of TLC into the thing, and it shows in its craftsmanship. Save for the plastic bottom, which lets the antenna do its thing without unnecessary interference, the entire body is forged out of stainless steel. The battery cover is wrapped in real leather, each individual key on the QWERTY keyboard is made of metal and the navigation buttons sitting below the screen are fashioned out of individual pieces of glass. And yet, its resemblance to the 9900 is unmistakable. There's a reason for this: they're essentially the same phone. Much like its sibling, the P'9981 sports a 1.2GHz Qualcomm MSM8655 CPU and 768MB of RAM, 2.8-inch touchscreen with a resolution of 640 x 480 (giving it a pixel density of 286ppi), BlackBerry OS 7.0 with Liquid Graphics, a 1,230mAh battery, GPS, NFC and a 5MP rear camera with an LED flash and 720p HD video capture. For all intents and purposes, Porsche Design pretty much took a Bold 9900 and stuck it in a more arresting chassis. Measuring in at 115 x 67 x 11.3mm (4.53 x 2.64 x 0.44 inches), it's one millimeter wider, an eight of a millimeter thicker and 25 grams (0.88 ounces) heavier, but it justifies its extra heft with a reassuringly solid feel. This hasn't been much of an issue in the past, as most BlackBerry devices we've tested have felt as though they'd survive two years worth of sporadic drops. Sure, the P'9981's sticker price is motivation enough to keep a death grip at all times, but truly, it feels as durable and well-constructed as its brethren. The button selection should look mighty familiar too: they're all in nearly the same place as they are on the 9900, with a few minor adjustments. The top is reserved solely for the lock button, while the bottom has two connector ports -- one on each end -- that allow the phone to fit perfectly on the desktop docking station that comes included in the box. Over on the left sits the micro-USB charging port and 3.5mm headphone jack, while on the opposite side you'll find BlackBerry's signature convenience key just below the volume rocker and mute button (which is sandwiched in between). Turning to the back will reveal the leather-wrapped battery cover, which features a metal bar on the top with "P'9981" engraved in the middle, and the camera and LED flash to its sides. Unsurprisingly, the battery cover also bears the BlackBerry logo underneath the metal bar, embossed into the leather. The Bold 9900 lump is still present, though the one found on the P'9981 is slightly more subtle. Speaking of which, the two covers are also different in the way they attach to the body -- the Bold's is smaller, comprising only the bump, whereas the Porsche Design model fits over the entire back of the phone. Lastly, we move to the front where we find the LED notification light, touchscreen display, the standard set of BlackBerry navigation buttons -- call, menu, trackpad, back and end / power -- and uniquely designed keyboard. Performance is exactly what we'd expect from a BlackBerry: great reception, wonderful call quality and robust battery life despite only offering a 1,230mAh juicepack. Our SunSpider 9.1 tests resulted in better scores than with the 9900, interestingly enough -- we averaged 2,495ms, a convincing 150ms lead over the phone's fraternal twin. Our intensive battery rundown test, however, kept the juice flowing for eight hours and fifteen minutes, which we found to be about the same as the Bold. Keyboard Truth be told, the keyboard may very well be the most interesting thing about the P'9981. As mentioned earlier, each key is individually crafted from metal, which should do an even better job withstanding your repeated phalangic abuse over the years. On the version we reviewed, each key has a letter and symbol / number inscribed that glows white when you're in a low light area, and an Arabic character which glows red at the same time. Of course, it wouldn't be a BlackBerry keyboard -- at least, not a high-end one -- without the frets, and they're present here. Granted, they're located in a radically different position than the 9900, found on the lower half of each key instead of on the side. This, along with its shorter and wider keys, contribute to a more difficult typing experience. The buttons are rather clicky, yet it's not as easy to spring from one to another. The keyboard in general was still pleasant to use, but it just wasn't as good. Gallery: BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9981 sample shots | 53 Photos. We were hoping that some extra expense would go into making the P'9981's camera more magical than the Bold's, but it wasn't meant to be. Indeed, the five megapixel rear shooter -- complete with an LED flash and 720p video capture -- produced very similar results. Much like its brother, the P'9981 uses an EDoF sensor that's unable to take macro shots and thus up-close images are unfortunately blurry. The pictures taken from a greater distance turned out better, though we had to mess around with the white balance settings a bit to get some decent shots. As BlackBerry cameras are typically stripped bare of any other special settings, the ability to manipulate such features as exposure, saturation, ISO or anything else manually was unfortunately not an option. With 720p video, too, we achieved roughly the same results as the Bold. Because the camcorder is fixed-focus, footage remained crisp throughout the entire clip, with the exception of excessive jiggle distortion. At first we just chalked it up to having somewhat shaky hands -- a direct result of not eating our veggies, we figured -- but then we recalled having the same experience with the 9900. That's not to say it's impossible to film a home video free of the shakes, but it will definitely involve an incredibly steady hand or an armrest to make it possible. Software The P'9981 runs BlackBerry 7.0, and we won't spend too much time delving into the OS; we cover the topic at length in our review of the Bold 9900 / 9930. However, one thing that really sticks out in the device's firmware is -- drumroll, please -- its custom theme. That's right, proud owners of the phone can feel comfortable knowing they're using a hoity-toity Porsche Design BlackBerry 7 theme. Honestly, very little is new outside of the home panels, which now offer a special set of icons and background options. Aside from this, the differences between firmware are very few, if any. For instance, the menus are the same, the UI elements aren't dissimilar and you have the same applications pre-loaded on each phone.. Gallery: BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9981 screenshots | 12 Photos. This new skin was designed to be exclusive to the phone, giving users a chance to feel elite and oh-so special. Do you feel like your life isn't yet complete because you don't have this special theme? You can now die satisfied, as someone has unsurprisingly found a way to port it to the Bold. For better or worse, that gives theme lovers one less reason to go with this device. Although, how many reasons did you have to get it in the first place? Wrap-up The P'9981 isn't going to change the world. It won't fight hunger or cure diseases. Yet to the general population, that's exactly what it's expected to do for a whopping $2,350 sticker price. The first Porsche Design smartphone will be a screaming deal to anyone who has way too much money to burn and just happens to crave a "fashionable" BlackBerry.

Low pixel density screen (286 ppi). Porsche Design P'9981 is a smartphone from BlackBerry. The phone with the futuristic QWERTY keyboard was formerly known as the BlackBerry Knight. The handset will be available from Porsche Design stores and there is speculation that the price tag will be a very Porsche-like $2,000.. So what are you getting for that stack of 20 C notes? The device offers solid construction, for one thing with a forged stainless steel frame, leather back, and a sculpted QWERTY keyboard. The model is equipped with a exclusive Porsche Design UI and a Wikitude World Browser augmented reality app. Each unit of the P'9981 gets a premium PIN that allows the user of the device to find another P'9981 user in a crowd.. Other specs include a single-core 1.2GHz processor, HD video capture and 8GB of native storage that can be pumped up to 40GB using a microSD card. The phone is NFC enabled and has BlackBerry 7 OS on board. That means the phone has the second-generation WebKit browser and includes the fast and smooth liquid graphics... Dimensions: 4.53 x 2.64 x 0.44 inches (115 x 67 x 11.3 mm). Weight: 5.47 oz (155 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Features: Full keyboard, Optical Mouse (Touchpad). Resolution: 640 x 480 pixels. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Software Features: Digital zoom, Geo tagging. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: HSDPA 14.4 Mbit/s, UMTS, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s. Notifications: Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Other: NFC, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 27 Oct 2011. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Sony Xperia XZ2 embraces curves, haptics and 4K HDR. Galaxy S9 price details: Verizon, T-Mobile, unlocked, more [Updated]. Huawei MateBook X Pro hides pop-up webcam in svelte 3k laptop. How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. Chris Davies - Feb 14, 2012. At first glance, Porsche Design and BlackBerry might not make obvious bed-fellows. Still, the car firm’s aesthetically-obsessed arm has taken up with Canada’s finest, and the Porsche Design P’9981 is the result: maple syrup by way of Stuttgart. The less forgiving might draw comparisons between Porsche’s legendary reluctance to diverge from its original 1963 car design, and BlackBerry’s struggle to break free of its old OS. The frugal will likely be too busy gaping at the $2,350 price tag. So, Porsche or Pinto? Check out the full SlashGear review after the cut.. Porsche Design starts as it means to go on, with an oversized box first presenting the P’9981 and its desk-stand in one dense foam layer, before revealing different chargers for near-global use, USB cable and headphones, various documentation and your exclusive technical support card, complete with PIN, to access freephone assistance. It’s not quite Vertu’s Concierge, mind; the team will help you set up your P’9981 and figure out its quirks, but not book you theater tickets.. The smartphone itself is certainly distinctive. RIM basically handed over the key parts of its Bold 9900 flagship, and Porsche Design dressed them up in a Dynasty -era suit, shoulderpads and all. It’s a resolutely aggressive, blunt design, all sharp edges and squared-off corners, with plenty of metal and metal-effect plastic, and it’s heavy too, feeling twice its actual 155g weight in the hand.. Porsche Design itself gets top billing, its name engraved into the brushed stainless-steel bar above the display; RIM’s BlackBerry logo is relegated to just below the earpiece, above the 2.8-inch 640 x 480 touchscreen. The display is bright and crisp, though lacks the color saturation of an AMOLED, while the touch response is good. The metal bar continues around the edge of the P’9981 – though with a polished mirror finish, rather than brushed – though the keyboard itself is plastic.. BlackBerry devices are famed for their keyboards, in fact you could construct a reasonable argument that it’s QWERTY text-entry that has kept the company afloat the past few years. Porsche Design does away with the 9900’s ‘board – one, we decided, of the best on the market – and replaces it with a heavily-stylized version with pronounced ridges. It’s not a bad keyboard – the spacing is good, as it spreads across the entire 67mm width of the phone, and the keys are clicky and responsive – but it’s definitely a step back from what the donor BlackBerry offers.. It’s also unevenly illuminated, with the backlighting focused in two patches that leave the center column of letters dimmer than the rest. No great functional issue, and you can still see them in low-light conditions, but it’s a noticeable flaw and one – since the backlighting is often active when the P’9981 is docked in its charger-cradle – you’re presented with all the time.. Sandwiched in-between the keyboard and the touchscreen is the usual row of call, menu and navigation buttons. They’re large and plasticky, and rock somewhat unnervingly under your finger. In their midst is the optical trackpad, which doubles as a select button, and is swiftly responsive. The left edge of the phone offers the 3.5mm headphones socket and a microUSB port, while the right has volume keys flanking a mute button (that doubles as a play/pause button in the media app) and a camera shortcut (that can be reprogrammed). On the top there’s a lock button.. If the front of the P’9981 is Terminator sturdy, the back is oddly unreassuring. An ingot of metal bears the 5-megapixel camera – which supports 720p but uses EDoF fixed-focus rather than auto-focus – and single LED flash, but the rest is a plastic panel that, despite being covered with leather, feels unduly cheap in comparison to the rest of the phone. There’s a little flex around the camera section, and the panel itself doesn’t click reassuringly into place as we might’ve hoped.. Peel it off, and you can see the antenna stuck to the back – connected with two discrete pins just above the Porsche Design branded 1,230 mAh battery – as well as the microSD card slot to augment the 8GB of internal memory. You’ll need to pull out the battery to swap the SIM card. This European unit has dualband 3G/UMTS (for up to 14.4 Mbps downloads and up to 5.76 Mbps uploads, network depending), quadband GSM/EDGE, WiFI a/b/g/n (with 2.4/5GHz support), Bluetooth and NFC, along with GPS, a digital compass, accelerometer and twin microphones for noise cancellation. Like the Bold 9900, the Porsche Design P’9981 runs BlackBerry 7 on a single-core Qualcomm MSM8655 1.2GHz processor, paired with 768MB of RAM.. RIM has hung its long-term hopes on BlackBerry 10, the QNX-based OS for phones and tablets expected to debut by the end of this year. Unfortunately, that leaves the P’9981 running BlackBerry 7, just as on the Bold 9900, and it’s a platform that’s seriously showing its age compared to iOS and Android.. Porsche Design, as the name might predict, makes no modifications to the software itself beyond an ill-advised icon redesign. The paired down iconography is certainly in keeping with the rest of the P’9981, but it also leaves app menus confusing: you have to make a conscious effort to tell the difference between each icon. It’s something you’ll no doubt get more adroit at handling, the longer you live with the handset, or indeed you can change the skin altogether.. Beyond that, our primary frustration with BlackBerry 7 is its general sense of being a patchwork platform: some aspects feel relatively fresh, but other areas feel like they’ve been dragged over from RIM’s OS several years back. The text-based elements of the UI are generally the swiftest but also the points that feel most dated in comparison to rival software; in contrast, BlackBerry App World is sluggish and the BlackBerry Maps app is a lesson in frustration compared to Google Maps or Nokia Maps.. RIM has worked hard on the internet experience in BlackBerry 7, and it’s certainly improved from earlier iterations. You still get a throwback mouse cursor, though we came to appreciate it more after finding how much finger-navigation obscures the touchscreen. Pinch-zooming in the browser works, but that compact display also makes it feel clumsy.. As always, the email experience is the primary reason for using a BlackBerry, though it’s at its best if you’re an enterprise customer with a BlackBerry Exchange Server. If you’re on the Gmail train then you’ll have to use IMAP – Google discontinued its Gmail for BlackBerry app late last year – though there’s the Enhanced Google Mail Plug-in from RIM itself that adds spam and archive support, integrates Gmail inbox searches with BlackBerry 7’s universal search, and imports your contacts. Still, the best Gmail experience continues to be on Android in our opinion, with iOS following behind that.. We’ve covered BlackBerry 7 more in our Bold 9900 review , but the long and short of it is that the OS feels dated and is well overdue a replacement. BlackBerry 10 can’t come soon enough.. 5-megapixels is midrange but acceptable for a smartphone, particularly one with business aspirations like the P’9981, but the fixed-focus is a disappointment. Not a surprising one – the Bold 9900 used EDoF after all – but still another black mark against the Porsche phone.. It means you’re limited in how close you can get with your macro shots, and in general images lack crispness in comparison to auto-focus cameras. Color balance is solid, and there’s a nice amount of detail in shots from the P’9981, but unlike, say, the iPhone 4S or Galaxy S II, you wouldn’t want to rely on the BlackBerry for all of your photography needs.. As for video, 720p is your high-definition maximum but the ensuing clips are good. Colors are accurate, if a little muted, and the digital image stabilization is neither ineffectual nor over-aggressive and helps smooth out a shaky hand. We found the sheer heft of the P’9981 also helped on that front too. Recorded clips can be sent via Bluetooth or WhatsApp, or uploaded to YouTube, though not emailed directly from the camcorder app.. Porsche Design P’9981 720p HD Video Sample:. Just behind email performance in the Big BlackBerry Book of Achievements is traditionally voice call quality and battery life: on this, the P’9981 drops one of the balls. Calling quality is great, with a loud earpiece and speaker for hands-free use, crisp – but not overly-processed – background noise reduction, and tenacious grip on a mobile signal. We also like how both your mobile network and current WiFi SSID are shown in the status bar.. Unfortunately, whereas at one time BlackBerry devices could be expected to run for days, the P’9981 follows in the Bold 9900’s metaphorical footsteps and tarnishes the family tradition. The 1,230 mAh battery may be Porsche Design branded but it’s otherwise exactly the same powerpack as the 9900 uses, and it’s simply not up to the challenge of the 1.2GHz processor.. RIM does its best to hide that fact, underclocking the chip most of the time so that you’re running on a fraction of those cycles, but step beyond simple email and you’ll find calls, web browsing, photography and third-party apps all take their toll. Left to its own devices and the P’9981 will run for a couple of days, even with email updating in the background, but actually use it as you might a rival smartphone and you’ll struggle to finish a day. The desk charger cradle does at least make topping up the juice more straightforward.. It’s hard to imagine the Porsche Design P’9981 convincing the everyman: its severe styling is too divisive, BlackBerry 7 OS questionable, and general specifications uncompetitive in places. Then again, the everyman isn’t the limited edition BlackBerry’s target audience. Like Vertu and “luxury” editions of other manufacturers’ phones, the appeal of the P’9981 is more about who hasn’t got it than who wants it.. $2,350 is a ridiculous amount of money for a smartphone. A quarter of that gets you an iPhone 4S or a Galaxy Nexus, either of which outclass the P’9981 on functionality, usability and – many would argue – style. However, just as Porsche Design borrowed the Dynasty shoulderpads, the P’9981 is the cellular equivalent of Alexis Carrington: brash and unforgivingly blunt, an unapologetic backhanded slap to the face of anybody who thinks their mainstream handset makes them special.. The rest of us will continue to buy iPhones, and Android phones, perhaps even some Windows Phones, and wait to see whether RIM can relaunch itself in Q4 with BlackBerry 10. The biggest problem with the P’9981 isn’t its love-it-or-hate-it design, or its mediocre camera, or even its insane price tag: it’s the fact that it highlights just how tired BlackBerry 7 is. In the end, even $2,350-worth of metal and leather and Porsche branding can’t hide that.. Topics Blackberry Phone Reviews Porsche RIM SlashGear Reviews smartphone video.

This score is based on our evaluation of 4. sources including reviews from users and the web's most trusted critics.. Take a BlackBerry Bold, soup it up with sharp metallic edges and a leather finish, and what you get is the BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9981. It’s a touch-and-type smartphone with enhanced styling and essentially offers a premium feel to the BB OS 7 experience. Hot lines to be sure, but what about performance? Unfortunately most reviewers agree that's a bit of a mixed bag.. The P’9981 is equipped with a speedy 1.2GHz CPU, 768MB RAM, and 8GB of internal storage. The rest of its features make it look like one of the better mid-range models available on the smartphone market. It supports quad-band GSM and dual-band UMTS networks, as well as EDGE, HSDPA, and HSUPA data speeds. It has a 2.8-inch 640x480 touchscreen display, 5MP camera, microUSB connectivity, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC. And of course, as a BlackBerry, it has a easy-to-use QWERTY keyboard. It may look different, but when it comes to messaging and communication it works quite well, just like a proper BlackBerry is supposed to.. The number one complaint made about the Porsche designed phone by most reviewers—apart from its price—has little to do with its hardware components and everything to do with its pre-installed software. Apparently, despite the many software improvements that are included as part of BlackBerry OS 7, it still can’t compare to the likes of Google’s Android or Apple’s iOS. Everything from the built-in Web browser to the aftermarket app store just can’t compete. To make matters worse, the standard 1,000 mAh battery can’t even last for a full day of normal use. That means charging needs to be done every night, which can be quite troublesome even with the special charging dock that’s included inside every package.. For what it’s worth, the P’9981 is a superb BlackBerry smartphone, but at nearly $2,000 its hard to justify driving this Porsche.. Need to Know: BlackBerry Porsche Design P’9981. Speedy processor and an ample amount of RAM for good performance. Built-in touchscreen display uses a hi-res panel that makes text and pictures appear crisp. Nearly $2,000 price tag can’t be justified either through hardware or software. Doesn’t offer anything new over the BlackBerry Bold, the basis of its design and features.

However, there is a charm to its build and styling that does make it stand out from the crowd. Moreover, the keyboard is superb and there are some nice extras included in....

The BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9881 is clearly an overpriced fashion handset that does little to truly justify its £1275 price. However, there is a charm to its build and styling that does make it stand out from the crowd. Moreover, the keyboard is superb and there are some nice extras included in the box. Ultimately, though, it’s the BlackBerry part of the partnership that lets it down. While BlackBerry OS 7.0 is a vast improvement over previous iterations, it still trails much of the competition for both core features and availability of apps. An almost justifiable indulgence for BlackBerry users but a far from sensible purchase for the rest of us.. Responsive UI, quick camera operation, exorbitant price. In case it wasn’t clear from the foregoing, this phone has excited a deep level of antipathy in me. BlackBerry 7 was an uncompetitive OS the moment it launched and hasn’t aged well since then.

In case it wasn’t clear from the foregoing, this phone has excited a deep level of antipathy in me. BlackBerry 7 was an uncompetitive OS the moment it launched and hasn’t aged well since then. The one thing that RIM really got right with the Bold 9900 was actually its design, which was attractive, contemporary, ergonomic, and durable. So now we’re being graced with a device that tries to fix the good parts and rehashes the bad with impunity. The P‘9981 simply doesn’t have a reason to exist. It fails to improve on anything about the Bold, introduces issues of its own, and — wait for it — costs around $2,000. I’ve intentionally kept the price out of this review in order to give this phone a fair hearing, but its presentation of dated software and so-so hardware leaves the verdict unequivocal. Whatever Porsche Design was trying to achieve with its first smartphone, it failed.. Keyboard is still great, high-resolution display, good communicator. It might sound like we've been rather harsh here, but there's no escaping the fact that the P'9981, Porsche Design or not, it still a BlackBerry at its core. Where it excels with communication features, it lacks with entertainment refinement. Whilst the app offering is there, it isn't anything li... It might sound like we've been rather harsh here, but there's no escaping the fact that the P'9981, Porsche Design or not, it still a BlackBerry at its core. Where it excels with communication features, it lacks with entertainment refinement. Whilst the app offering is there, it isn't anything like as exciting as you'll get on Apple or Android. You couldn't say the Porsche Design BlackBerry P'9981 was good value for money, but then you couldn't say that about a Porsche either. A VW Beetle will get you from A to B comfortably and effectively, but people still go out and buy the Porsche Cayman. But this is a little like buying your Cayman with a 1.2-litre Beetle engine: it has the looks and it will get you there, but not like a Porsche should.. Made with high-quality materials, above average battery life, functionality doesn't justify the cost. The P'9981 isn't going to change the world. It won't fight hunger or cure diseases. Yet to the general population, that's exactly what it's expected to do for a whopping $2,350 sticker price.

Yet to the general population, that's exactly what it's expected to do for a whopping $2,350 sticker price. The first Porsche Design smartphone will be a screaming deal to anyone who has way too much money to burn and just happens to crave a "fashionable" BlackBerry.

Home > Phones >. Phone reviews > BlackBerry phone reviews. It's expensive, but if you can afford it, that will be of little concern to you. We hate the way the back cover comes off but overall, this is a nice experience from a slightly different looking Bold 9900. Theme makes the app icons a little more difficult to determine. BB 7 OS isn't as dynamic as rivals. Back cover comes off too easily. Design Hardware Software, apps, performance And finally…. There are enough high-profile fans of the BlackBerry to make something like this Porsche Design special edition make sense. From celebrities to CEOs, the BlackBerry still has quite a hold on people as a great communicator, whether for business or pleasure.. And this Porsche Design P'9981 BlackBerry is something special. But does it go far enough? Will this give you a BlackBerry experience that surpasses what you'll find elsewhere? Is this the BlackBerry handset you should be aspiring to own?. RIM isn't known for design variation. Tracking the family of the BlackBerry handsets, not a huge amount has changed over the past few years. The same could be said of Porsche automobiles, but both the Porsche and the BlackBerry are rather iconic in their design.. The Porsche Design BlackBerry P'9981, however, really brings some class to the tried and tested Bold formula. Where the standard Bold blends in with the rest of the BB crowd, the P'9981 is distinct and individual and really stands out in a sea of similarity.. Whether you like it, or not, will be a case of personal taste and we've come from a position of thinking it was brash and offensive, to one where we love the look and feel. You know it's special and so does everyone you show it to.. Hewn from stainless steel, it's still instantly recognisable as a BlackBerry thanks to the split face offering a full QWERTY keyboard below the display. The finish is very good in most places. The keyboard feels right, the phone looks right from every angle. Where the metal gives way for the display you have wonderful distinct clean design lines.. But as much as we love the design, it's design where this phone also suffers. The back is plastic and finished in leather, although it feels substantial enough when in place it doesn't attach especially well to the back of the phone.. Like many devices, it uses regularly placed plastic tabs to hold it on, but on our sample it was all too easy to pop the back off by accident. Grip the phone wrong and you feel the back detach. Porsche cars have a reputation for letting the back-end go so we're wondering if it is some sort of in-joke.. The second point is the positioning of the convenience key. This is a useful button, which you can program to open an application of your choice - the default is to launch the camera. It is positioned in the right edge, exactly where your hand would be if you use a two-thumbed keyboard technique. On more than one occasion we were furiously typing emails, only to find we’d launched the camera.. Aside from the overly large box that the phone arrives in, you also get a matching dock. This too is finished in steel and leather and features a soft light to guide your Porsche phone in at night for refuelling. It's a convenient bedside stand and we like it a lot.. This being a dressed-up BlackBerry Bold, the keyboard is one of the most important elements. At first we weren't sold on it, as the alternative characters are much more difficult to see than on the regular Bold. This isn't helped by the decision to move away from the tried and tested black background, but the backlighting certainly helps make things clearer once you start typing.. Although the design is sharper, and the cut across the individual keys is sharper and more defined than on the Bold, that action isn't too different. Given a couple of days with the phone, we found that using it became second nature. Despite the changes, it's only really the occasional moment when you're left looking for a colon that it causes a problem.. Internally, there is less to talk about, especially if you've read our BlackBerry Bold 9900 review. You get a 1.2GHz processor, 768MB RAM and 8GB of internal memory. BlackBerry has been kind enough to include a 16GB microSD card too, so you should be well provisioned for storage.. The screen too, is the same as the original Bold. It is a capacitive touchscreen, with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. That sounds low in modern terms, but at only 2.8-inches, it gives you an impressive 287ppi. It will render fine detail crisply and there is punch and vibrancy to the colours, but it's let down with a flaky touch response.. We're convinced this is nothing to do with the hardware and everything to do with the software, more on which later.. Around the back of the phone you have a 5-megapixel camera, supported by an LED flash. This is lacking in modern terms, not because of the pixel count, but because it is fixed focus. This sets it behind other smartphone cameras in terms of results, which aren't as sharp as we'd like. Given good conditions you'll get snaps acceptable for sharing, but the inability to focus on close detail is irritating.. The camera also offers you HD video of the 720p variety. Again, focus is fixed so it's not as adept as some rivals, although this is less of an issue in mobile video capture. The results are average, a little noisier than you might expect, but perfectly acceptable for casual use.. The external speaker is surprisingly good and loud. It lacks bass, obviously, so isn't great for music, but plug in a pair of quality headphones and the results are good too. The external speaker is in the bottom of the device and surprisingly it isn't devastatingly muffled when you park it on the dock.. There is a set of Porsche Design headphones in the box, which offer an in-line mic, but we weren't taken by the quality of the audio they offered and were easily surpassed by the Klipsch headphones we tried instead.. The ear speaker is loud enough and we had no problems hearing callers, although that neatly designed angular top edge can be a little uncomfortable against your ear in long calls. We also found we could hear our end of the conversation being repeated through the ear speaker during a call, although this might be a problem limited to this device.. So far the Porsche Design BlackBerry P'9981 has hit most of the right markers. The hardware looks powerful on paper, the cameras are okay, but not fantastic, and the design and keyboard are mostly without issue. But a phone hangs on the software performance, which governs the user experience.. The theme applied to the Porsche Design handset can be switched off if you don't like it, although it is nice to have something a little different. But what it loses is in the app icons. All the native app icons have been stylised and in the process it all become rather generic, so it's more difficult to spot the app you want in a flash.. But this customisation only applies to the native and preinstalled apps, not those you then download, so it does end up being something of a mishmash.. Starting with the positives, the BlackBerry 7 OS that the P'9981 sits on provides a great communication experience. BlackBerry's integrated messaging system and universal search make it easy to find what you're looking for and managing a busy email life is certainly easy. It's mostly conversant with things like Google accounts, although it will stumble with multiple calendars - Google Sync will resolve that for you though.. The combination of touch and type works to a point. You can quickly select an icon or tap a link, which is better than scrolling across the optical trackpad to make things happen. But on many occasions, like trying to press a button at the bottom of the display, the screen doesn't respond. When people are becoming familiar with a silky smooth and refined touch experiences elsewhere, BB 7 feels a little rudimentary.. We won't go into more detail of what RIM needs to do to move the OS forward, but we will stop to talk about the topic du jour: apps. They have redefined the mobile experience and the BlackBerry, while offering many and varied applications, finds itself without some of the biggest names.. There is no Skype, for example, no Netflix, no BBC iPlayer and some of the core apps, such as YouTube, merely redirect to the mobile website. The App World app itself isn't great and whenever you come to download and install new apps, everything else grinds to a halt and often begs for a restart.. The browser, although vastly better than previous BB versions, is no match for Android or iOS. Pinch zooming doesn't work well at all, scrolling can be slow and jerky, even if pages load quickly enough.. The result is that no matter how well you dress your BlackBerry, the experience is very much the same. If you spend your time working through emails sitting in the back seat of a Phaeton, then you probably won't care. The core BlackBerry services are well integrated and run without a hitch - except Maps, which is as good as useless. If you're the sort of person who whiles away time on the train with a little casual gaming, or catching up on last night's TV, this isn't the phone for you.. The last word goes to battery life. With a 1230mAh battery, the P'9981 struggles to make it through a busy day. Like the Bold 9900 , we found that the P'9981 needed to be charged every night. This is slightly out of character for a BlackBerry handset, as most of the rest of the range will easily make it through a day. At least you have that dock to park it on, so you don't need to fiddle around with cables.. It might sound like we've been rather harsh here, but there's no escaping the fact that the P'9981, Porsche Design or not, it still a BlackBerry at its core. Where it excels with communication features, it lacks with entertainment refinement. Whilst the app offering is there, it isn't anything like as exciting as you'll get on Apple or Android.. You couldn't say the Porsche Design BlackBerry P'9981 was good value for money, but then you couldn't say that about a Porsche either. A VW Beetle will get you from A to B comfortably and effectively, but people still go out and buy the Porsche Cayman. But this is a little like buying your Cayman with a 1.2-litre Beetle engine: it has the looks and it will get you there, but not like a Porsche should.. We can't say the P'9981 is any worse than the Bold 9900 in terms of performance. It has the same positives and the same negatives. Together they offer the best performance in the current BlackBerry portfolio, if that's the phone you're after. With a price of €1475. it will never be deemed good value for money, but then what Porsche is?.
