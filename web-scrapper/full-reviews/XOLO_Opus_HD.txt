Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Face detection, Geo tagging. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance..

System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 28.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 25.0 days (600 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 9.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 20.8 days (500 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS.

Xolo Opus HD: Lining up those Futuristic Trends If entertainment is what you seek, then the latest Xolo Opus HD is the perfect choice for the more enthusiastic flock. This is one super slim entity where quite largely focuses on the overall performance rather than loading a million specs without a stronger base. While the massive battery renders the added functionality, this sleek gadget effectively changes the way Xolo has ever been approached by the Indian market. Although, Xolo Opus HD can be considered as one budget smartphone, it packs in a lot more for the users to look elsewhere as with the display and even the processor needs. The speculative device has been announced and here we are, eagerly waiting for this enigma to set into the daily framework. Be it the powerful battery or the extremely competent processor, the Xolo Opus HD does every single thing which has been claimed by the company while throwing in a lot more in the form of accessories and perks. The exceptional Android OS makes an appearance whereas the potent camera can click out certain high-end snapshots without going over the top. Design: With slimmer dimensions and manageable body to weight ratio, the Xolo Opus HD is surely capable of attracting a few positive glares. While the volume and power keys sit in perfectly at the edges, dual SIM card slot is certainly a utilitarian addition. One may also make the full use of the Micro USB slot with 5 pin connectivity whereas the audio jack is mostly meant for regulating the audio output. With the micro SD card slot being provided in addition to the plastic body with matte finish, the Xolo Opus HD comes as one perfect addition the ever expanding Xolo family. Display: The name itself suggests as what the company would throw in terms of display and screen size. In comes the 5 inch screen which sports a 1280x720-pixels resolution in addition to the 294PPI as the pixel density, These two in unison dish out a near perfect viewing experience at the given price range. While the viewing angles are well covered by the exclusive device, the Xolo Opus HD sports a wider range with about 256K color combinations and the IPS display technology. The multi-touch screen is bound to be an instant hit among the individuals who are willing to get more at a pre-defined budget. Processor and Storage: This device is nonchalantly powered by the 1.2GHz Quad-core chipset of the Broadcom make. The BCM23550 processor is certainly a lot pacier than most of the contemporaries whereas the 312MHz GPU readily accentuates the gaming performance. One can surely feel quite at ease with the Videocore IV chipset powering the gaming performance as it can also handle the multitasking chores with relative comfort. What stands out is the 1GB RAM which is perfectly paired up with the allotted processors, thus enhancing the overall functionality and performance of this budget device. Besides the gig of flash memory, one may also find the 8GB built-in support which can be expanded up to a whopping 32GB but as expected much of the allotted space gets compromised as for the OS and pre-installed applications. OS and Camera: The Xolo Opus HD readily incorporates the latest version of the Android OS namely KitKat 4.4.2 which comes with a seamless user interface and a perfected navigation bar. As for the camera, Xolo does incorporate quite a lot in the form of the 8MP rear unit which has the built-in LED flash support and the Autofocusing spec. Be it the scene detecting modes or the Panoramic shots, users do feel at ease with the allotted rear unit besides the 2MP front variant which ably assists operator controlled video calls while allowing the users to click out detailed selfies. 1080P HD recording and Geo-tagging alternatives are also provided besides the face detection feature, adding compactness to the device. Battery and Connectivity: A monstrous 2500mAh is supported by the Xolo Opus HD. which is all set to provide a 3G talk time limit of 9 hours whereas the device would last a single charge for a day at high to average usage. As the 3G support is provided besides the Wi-Fi standards and the Bluetooth hardware, this device turns up the heat against many well-known brands. Bottom-Line: Here is an Android Powered Budget smartphone which can readily boast of a powerful camera followed by the seemingly beautiful display. While the processor is exceptionally fast, the GPU comes along as one hefty inclusion, making the device perform at its fullest.

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus, Back-illuminated sensor (BSI). Software Features: Face detection, Geo tagging. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time: 28.00 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 25.0 days (600 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Talk time (3G): 9.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 20.8 days (500 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Built-in online services support: YouTube (upload), Picasa/Google+. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. Data: HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS.

GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization..

Lacshay Shekhar , Better than You!!. If you don't want to spend 4k extra, that's fine, but MotoG2 is a great phone with value for buck beyond imagination. To suggest that you buy XOLO Opus HD or not, i would say 'No', because: XOLO has not yet completely optimized their software and is in no way at par with the competition I think one of Micromax's Engage phones also uses the same chipset and processor, but is a lot cheaper (because the hardware is dated) No software updates (Motorola guarantees updates for 18 months) Reviews are not out because it's not worth reviewing (don't mean to be rude, but it is an okay phone by a company which is struggling to gain market share and the phone has nothing special about it) There are better phones out there If budget is an issue, you can give phones under Android One program a swirl and see if you are satisfied with one of them as the software end is held by Google itself and guaranteed updates for 18 months and they are even cheaper and have a chip-set with identical performance If budget is not a big problem, go with MotoG2 without hesitation,and if you are still skeptical about buying MotoG2 due to the price, you can check out deals on MotoG, or look up Asus Zenphone which is selling like hotcakes (but has its own flaws) Hope I could Help!. 232 Views · View Upvoters. promoted by MIT Sloan Executive Education. 3-month advanced online course by MIT Sloan.

Avinash Raj , studied at Netaji Subhash Engineering College. Answered Nov 2, 2014 · Author has 70 answers and 1.3m answer views. I know you knew the specification of both phone. Xolo got 1.2 GHz quad-core Broadcom (BCM23550) processor with 312 MHz Vidcore IV GPU. Moto G(2nd Gen) got 1.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 with Adreno 305. Snapdragon is much better in term of performance and Adreno in term of Graphic as compare to Broadcom and Vidcore GPU. I didn't find benchmark score of Xolo but I bet it won't beat Moto G(2nd Gen). Build in quality of moto is also better than Xolo. If you didn't bother about performance then go with Xolo but I'll suggest you to go with moto.. Gowtham Arumugam , Blogger, Aspiring Digital Marketer, Sports Marketer. Answered Nov 2, 2014 · Author has 230 answers and 403.4k answer views. I would suggest you to buy a Moto G (product) (2nd Gen) because the only difference between them is the processor. Moto G uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor but Xolo Opus HD uses a Broadcomm processor. Snapdragon processors are the best in the market so you should go for the Moto G (2nd Gen) and it also has a good brand value. by the way thanks for correcting the model number.
