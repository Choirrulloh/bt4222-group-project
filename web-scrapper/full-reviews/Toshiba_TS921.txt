Honestly, i am interested on texting you about it however, i was so sleepy last night. just to let you know i am working on night shifts so i hope you understand if i can't reply to your messages. going back onto your post, i hope you don't mind if you could share tips and tricks in regard to this phone. particularly you have said something about that ma-5 thing. how does it work? how can you play full track music given that you said it's only good for 30secs? where can we download the converter (just be specific hehe)? comparing to mp3 what can we expect?. i really dont know about that info. hope you could shed us some light on this, it would be appreciated. its works very fine for me when it comes to music....mine is a japan made toshiba 902..yes it an't play mp3 music but it can play ma-5(visit yamaha site and you can see an mmf converter)don't use ma2 converter use wave sound converter...ma-5(much more better than that damn mp3) supports better quality than ma-2....you should try to grind it yourself....just use a lil brain on doing it.very simple...well its good only for 30 secs of music...but i figured it out myself o how i can play it full track but its for my personal use only..... please let me know via this post if the steps i have provided worked on your phone. for the convenience of smart users who wants to unleash watching mtvs, video clips, and hi-speed downloading on your 902t, here's what you need to do:. SET 3G N70 (send to 333 - just do it). once done, you'll receive your settings and will be asked to activate them. Code required will be simply 1234. These settings can be viewed but cannot be edited. Reboot your phone then try the Vodafone Live! link in your browser...it should lead you to smart's home page. Try other sites such as google and yahoo and it should work. if you have questions text me at 09286570631. h! every1...i have my v902t,,and i really love it..but sad 2 say..theres a lot of problems with my phne.,ac2ally im a globe users,,so,i hve already a gprs nd mms settngs..but un4tunately,globe cannot give me a cmpatible 4 streaming settngs.and ever since,i cant try 2 experience the live channels..i hope somebody help me on how do i get the cmpatible streaming settngs and even smart cannot give me a mms and gprs settngs,specially streaming settngs,,,and also my prblem is my phone is not cmpatible to files like, sis,zip,wav,mp3, only jad,3gp,amr,jpg,smf.and when i downlod,like gif 10kb,the prompt is This content cannot be download due to size limitation...i think my phone memory is enough 4 me download,but sad 2 say i really cant do it. i hope u can understand my grammar,coz i live here in the philippnes..and i hope u can help me,,i wait 4 response soon..i really really need your help.you can txt me my smart no.09202221925,un4tunately my globe no.is private,and sorry 4 that...please hope somebody want 2 help all my prblms..BIG THANKS 2 all.. one more thing, if you are going to download games from republika.pl, do it on PC, hover the mouse on the link, type the link on your phone, and it'll do straight download. DO NOT use the phone to browse the site. it will waste your time and your load as well. lastly, for music stuff, unfortunately, the phone can't read mp3s - only 3gp, amr, midi, and smf. so just bear with its low quality sound or sell the phone if you are not satisfied. anyhow as for me it's still a very nice phone. hi again, i have read the posts from other 902t users, and I think i can help you with some concerns. in regard to downloading games, try to get them at these sites:. do not save them on memory card, use phone memory instead. It won't allow you to save games on memcard for reasons that i don't know. don't worry though, the phone has lots of space good enuff for maybe 10+ games (or even 20 i guess). I only have 5 with me and I enjoy playing them. default password of 902t in case you do not know is 9999. you should try these passcode if you need to master rest the phone. please refer on my previous posts on how to setup your 3g to enjoy downloading games and browsing stuff through this mobile phone (NOTE: smart users only - no globe). as for bluetooth, unfortunately u can only use blutooth for sending contacts and notes. but for sending pix and other stuff, you can only use MMS or Infrared. You can receive pix via BT but you won't be able to send using it. as for USB issues, i do not have a USB cable with me. what I use to transfer stuff is a memcard reader, and OTA - for downloading stuff online. hope this post helped you in someway. And my Bluetooth is not working. How to download ang games or music?. And also my password is not woking.I cannot delete my folder... Kindly email me as soon as possible or call me at 09284164958 or 09158572384. And my password is not working that's why I Can't delate my folder.. My question is about vodafone 902T. I cant seem to install any new application nor games to this phone. Can anyone help me with this problem?. And my bluetooth also dont work... but i have a memory card and a reader but i dont know what type of game extension should i look for. it has only two games which are both for evaluation only. I want to install new games. text me at 0915 - 855 - 9155. hey ms.Althea we have the same problem with our phone anyway if you could find a way to fix please also let me know. The technician said that it had to be reprogram but unfortunately they still dont have the software to reprogram it until now.. My inquiry is about my toshiba phone vodafone 902t.. i turned it on tha sreen just displayed th meassage DB_ERR..and now i cant use it anymore.. can anyone help me find a software to reprogram my toshiba phone. the technicians says that it needs to be reprogram but still now they dont have the software to reprogram my phone. please help me i really love this phone together with my k800i phone. I am beginning to love my phone despite of its shortcomings when it comes to playing mp3 files. I had a chance to download lots of games and apps, and the phone works wonders. Imagine playing 3d games on this phone for hours - if you are aware if Fishlab games (awesome 3d java games), and also adventure games from gameloft, and even the old school games like space invaders, atari games, even street fighter of snes...my phone's heating while playing but its fine! its normal. although my current music files has low bitrate, while im using it in my office still the loudspeaker sounds ok and not that distorted unlike if you use earphones on it. you'll love this phone eventually, just learn its capabilities and go with the flow.. if any 1 can hepl me to convert ma mp3s to wat ever ie is that will allow it to b played, pleez do. i got a ts921 that i got from japan but am now in jamaica(the land with black men with stiff dicks) and am abit dissapointd. i wz lookin faword to havin a phone that cud play mp3s only to find out that it cant. i wz readin up on the fone and saw sumtin about convertin from mp3s to ....... to sumtin else, i dont remembr rite now but i really wanna hear music on ma fone. can sum1 help me to go about this. For SMART3G users, to unleash the phone's 3g capabilities, register your phone as N90, and it should work. Vodafone Live! menu will be enabled and it'll lead you to SMART's homepage. - SET 3G N90 (send to 211). - GPRS ON (send to 333). - MMS ON (send to 333). As for everyone's concern regarding playing music files...someone suggested to convert mp3s to 3GPs to play them. I've tried that ImTOO software thingy and sad to say, i am not satisfied with the results. 3GP files have a very low bitrate -. PROS: if you have a 1gb sd card, you can store LOTS of music files. on the camera, it's fine I have no comments on that. Unfortunately, this phone is not mp3 capable, which is not for me - I browse, i download, i record, i play. that's me as a mobile phone user. anyone interested on my phone, i've posted it on eBay.ph you might want to look at them. It has been gmasked for a unique look - from matte black to striped red.. how can i use the internet on this handset? tnx..... i just want to ask where did you buy this unit?.. i'd like to have a vodafone as well..
