Not really a smartphone, but priced like one. The Microsoft Kin One could have been a cute messaging phone, but it's being sold as an under-powered smartphone.. The Microsoft Kin One is a well-designed, cute little messaging phone in the spirit of the T-Mobile Sidekick ($49.99, ). Along with its sibling the Kin Two, it's one of the first Zune phones and the closest you'll get to Windows Phone 7 before "the holidays." Had it been free with contract or on a prepaid plan, the Kin One could have kicked other texting phones to the curb. But Verizon has made the Kin One more expensive to own than the Palm Pre Plus ($29.99, )and in that company, the Kin phones look downright crippled.. Droid Incredible by HTC (Verizon Wireless). Microsoft is releasing two Kin phones with Verizon. The Kin One is a jaunty little slider that fits easily in one hand, at the cost of a cramped screen and only 4GB for music and video storage. We cover the Kin Two in an associated review .. View All 6 Photos in Gallery. At 3.25 by 2.5 by .75 inches (HWD) and 3.9 ounces, the Kin One is an alien-looking little oval. Closed, it shows a finger-width of white bezel both above and below the black screen. Slide up the screen to find rounded, well-separated keys floating on a white background. The whole look is more imaginative and better-built than the Kin Two; because you can hold it in one hand it's easier to take photos, for instance. And the Kin One has a certain finesse that competing messaging phones like the Samsung Alias 2 ($29.99, ) lack. The Kin One's small form factor is appealing, but the 2.6-inch, 320-by-240 capacitive touch screen kills the attraction. There's just not enough room on this screen: you can see two e-mail subject lines (as opposed to five on the Kin Two), six menu options (as opposed to ten), or two social-networking updates (as opposed to four.) It just feels cramped.. The Kin One makes phone calls on Verizon's CDMA network and connects to the Internet either through Verizon's 3G EVDO Rev A system or Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g. Neither Kin is the greatest voice phone, but the Kin One falls a little behind its larger sibling. Sound through the earpiece was fine, but my voice heard on the other side of the call sounded muddy and computery at times, with considerable amounts of background noise coming through. The speakerphone was just barely loud enough for outdoor usethe Kin Two has a much louder speakerphone. The Kin One paired with our Aliph Jawbone Icon ($99, ) Bluetooth headset to make calls, but the phone doesn't have voice dialing. You can't use your own music as ringtones, either. Battery life was fine at just under five and a half hours of talk time.. The Kin runs its own OS, which has a lot in common with but is not quite the upcoming Windows Phone 7. For one thing, the Kin has no downloadable apps. That's it: what you see is what you get, plus whatever over-the-air updates Microsoft will choose to send down. The Kin is actually more akin to a texting phone than to a modern smartphone, as smartphones continually grow and change with new apps.. The Kin's interface doesn't look or work like anything else you've ever seen. It's a little like the Zune, but even that isn't going to help you much.. When you hit the phone's wake-up button, you see what appear to be the handwritten words, "nice to meet you." Drag the corner of the page up to show the Loop, the Kin's "home page" of social networking updates, as bold and messy as a teenager's room. Swipe left to see the main menubig blocks of text and graphicsand swipe right to see your favorite people as a jigsaw-puzzle of photos.. The Kin ingests MySpace, Facebook and Twitter accounts, as well as Exchange, Gmail, Yahoo, Windows Live, and POP3/IMAP e-mail. But it doesn't do as much with those accounts as the competition does. Contacts come from Windows Live, MySpace, Facebook, and Exchange. You can't integrate someone's Twitter or Gmail information into their contact card if it isn't in Facebook.. Contact integration in general isn't as good as you'd see on an HTC phone like the Droid Incredible or Droid Eris ($79.99, ). There's no way to see all of your communication with someone from their contact card. You can swipe over to their Facebook Wall, but you don't get to see all the texts or e-mails you sent with the person connected to their address card.. The Loop, the Spot, and the Studio. Three features define the Kin experience: the Loop, the Spot, and the Studio. The Loop is the Kin's home page, and it should be a continuous feed of social-networking updates and your favorite RSS feeds. It's quite satisfying if you use Facebook and MySpace, and less so if you use Twitter, as your Twitter and Facebook contacts aren't matched up and so the updates seem to be coming from separate people. Tapping on an update lets you comment on a Facebook or MySpace message; for Twitter and RSS feeds, you can open them in the browser. E-mails and texts, annoyingly, are out of the Loopthey just don't appear on that screen.. The Spot lets you share stuff. As you wander through your phone experience, you can tap on itemsTwitter updates, photos, even Web pagesand dump them on the Spot, to be later packaged up and either uploaded to a social-networking service or sent by text or e-mail.. The Studio is the best thing about the Kin. Several of the things you do on the Kin are automatically backed up into a password-protected Web site that shows a timeline of what you've done on your phone: every phone call, every text message, every photo taken. It doesn't show your e-mails, but presumably you have those somewhere else. You can download your photos and messages, and prune your address book, from the Studio. The Studio isn't Microsoft-centric; while it requires Silverlight, I ran it in Firefox on both Windows Vista and Mac OS X 10.5.. The Kin's Internet Explorer-based Web browser is excellent, though it has a few usability quirks. Desktop pages display very accurately, and you can pinch to zoom and add visual bookmarks of your favorite pages. But since the browser seems to identify itself as Mobile IE, you often get stripped-down "mobile" versions of pages when the Kin is perfectly capable of showing full pages. As you could expect, the Web experience is a heck of a lot better on the large-screen Kin Two than on the small-screen Kin One.. I easily loaded and synced Exchange, Gmail, and Yahoo accounts, but more complicated HTML emails wouldn't view at all. The Kin phones also integrate Bing local and Web search through a dedicated button that also does a very limited local search, of contacts and apps only.. The Kin One includes a built-in Zune HD ($199-$269, )for free!sort of. The phone has 4GB of built-in storage, but there is no memory card slot, so you'll run out of room pretty quickly if you're into video.. Under an icon marked "Music & More," you can access a full set of Zune functions, including an analog FM radio, and they work just like a Zune. To get music and video on or off the Kin, you sync it with the Zune Player on a PC using an included MicroUSB cable, or with upcoming Mac software that Microsoft pledges to make available soon. I found music, videos, podcasts and photos synced two ways, and they sounded good both over wired and Bluetooth headsets. The Kin One's small screen made videos feel cramped, but even high-def videos were automatically scaled down to 320-by-240 by the Zune software, with no loss of smoothness.. The Kin One's 5-megapixel camera geotags photos with your location (even indoors), but it isn't the best phone camera out there. In low light, images got blurry easily. Outdoors, focus felt soft and light sources seemed to overwhelm the sensor. The Kin One's video mode records washed-out but sharp VGA videos.. A short list of what's missing: no apps, no instant messaging, no calendar, and no GPS navigation. With the right service plan, the Kin phones could still have cleaned up. The Kin One may have a cramped screen, but it's awfully adorable, and its social-networking affinities and physical style beat any texting phone on the market.. Unfortunately, it's not being sold as a texting phone. The HTC Incredible and Motorola Devour ($149.99, ) both have better social-networking support, and all smartphones have lots of games and add-on programs to make them even better. So why is Verizon putting the Kin One on the same $30 a month data plan as the far-superior HTC Incredible, Droid Eris, and Palm Pre Plus? A Verizon rep let the sad reason slip: because Kin owners will use the Internet, so Verizon wants to charge based on potential heavy Internet use.. At the price Verizon is charging, it's hard for me to recommend the Kin One over the Palm Pre Plus, Motorola Devour, or other smartphones. If potential Kin buyers can afford more than a texting phone, they will be better served by a phone that grows with a thriving third-party apps community.. Continuous Talk Time: 5 hours 22 minutes. Compare the Microsoft Kin One (Verizon Wireless) with several other mobile phones side by side.. Bottom Line: The Microsoft Kin One could have been a cute messaging phone, but it's being sold as an under-powered smartphone..

CNET también está disponible en español.. Kin One (Verizon Wireless) review:. The Good The Kin One offers easy access to contacts and social networking sites. The One and its sibling, the Kin Two, are the first Windows phones to feature the Zune multimedia experience, including Zune Pass. The Web-based Kin Studio backs up all of your phone's data. The Kin One also has Wi-Fi, 3G, Bluetooth, and a 5-megapixel camera.. The Bad The Kin One has a small display and can be sluggish. No calendar app or IM clients. User interface can be a bit overwhelming and has a bit of a learning curve. You can't upload photos to Twitter.. The Bottom Line The Kin One offers young people a different and fun social networking experience, but its lack of certain basic features and required monthly data plan will limit its appeal.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Editors' note, November 24, 2010: Though Microsoft discontinued the Kin One and Two in June 2010, Verizon brought them back in November and is now selling them as feature phones with modified capabilities .. In April 2010, Microsoft finally took the wraps off Project Pink and introduced two new phones targeted at the younger generation of social butterflies: the Kin One and Kin Two. However, the reveal was shrouded in questions and doubt rather than excitement. Who would want this kind of device, especially in the wake of the Windows Phone 7 announcement? Even though Microsoft was very clear in saying that the Kin devices would not appeal to everyone and was specifically targeted at a younger, more social crowd, we were still apprehensive .. Flash forward to now, when we've had a couple of days to check both the Kin One and Kin Two and can see things more clearly. Stepping back from our role as tech journalists and trying to get in the mindframe of the target demographic, we can see how the Kin One and Two might appeal to teens and 20-somethings. The phones offer instant access to favorite friends and a constant connection to them through the tight social-networking integration. They also offer a different and fun user experience than a lot of other full-featured phones on the market.. All of this is well and good, but as we said before, part of the devices' success would depend on the pricing of the phones and data plans. Interestingly, when we first received the phones, Microsoft and Verizon said the pricing would be $79.99 for the Kin One and $149.99 for the Kin Two, both with a two-year contract and after a $100 mail-in rebate. We were just about ready to launch into a tirade when at the last minute we received word that the pricing had been changed to $49.99 and $99.99, respectively--much, much better. Unfortunately, though, there's no adjustment to the monthly data plan. Both the Kin One and Two will require monthly $29.99 unlimited data plans, just like Verizon's other smartphones and 3G multimedia and feature phones. Considering the amount of data the handsets use, it makes sense, but still: the target group probably doesn't have much disposable income, and this may pose a problem to the Kins' overall success.. The Microsoft Kin One and Two will be available for preorder through Verizon's Web site starting May 6 and will ship within 48 hours. The devices will be in all Verizon stores nationwide May 13.. Of the two Kin phones, the Kin One has the more interesting design and is sure to turn some heads. At first glance, it doesn't even look like a phone. It's squarish in shape but with rounded edges, and the front section of the slider phone is smaller than the back part, which adds to its unique look. When talking with CNET digital audio editor Jasmine France, we concluded that it looked like some kind of fitness device or even some of the older Rio MP3 players. We wouldn't call the Kin One ugly--just different.. This is not your average phone. The Kin One has quite a distinctive design.. The handset is extremely compact and lightweight, measuring 3.25 inches tall by 2.5 inches wide by 0.75 inch deep and weighing 3.9 ounces. It fits nicely in the hand, though when on a call, we preferred to have the keyboard open since it felt weird to hold a hockey-puck-size device up to our ear. The phone feels solid overall, and the soft-touch finish on back prevents it from feeling completely slick and becoming a smudge magnet like the front of the device.. Now, given the smaller size, we figured the full QWERTY keyboard would be a nightmare to use, but it's actually not that bad. Admittedly, the layout is slightly cramped, so users with larger thumbs may need time to acclimate; and even though the keys are raised above the phone's surface, they're slightly stiff to press. Still, the oval buttons aren't too small and there's a decent amount of spacing between them, so that cuts down on mispresses. We also appreciate the shortcut keys on the bottom row for the phone app, search, and emoticons.. The Kin One's QWERTY keyboard was a bit cramped, so people with big thumbs beware.. If anything, it's the display that suffers from the Kin One's petite size. The 2.6-inch QVGA capacitive touch screen is pretty cramped, especially with all the information that's populated on the Loop home screen (more on this later). It also makes it less than ideal for viewing movies and Web pages, though for the latter you at least get pinch-to-zoom support. With a QVGA resolution, it's the not the sharpest display on the block, but we found it to be sufficiently bright and clear for reading messages and viewing images. There's an ambient light sensor that will automatically adjust the screen's brightness depending on the environment, but the screen still washed out in bright sunlight.. The touch screen is mostly responsive, though the scrolling experience isn't quite as smooth as we'd like it be. Below the display, you get only one button, which takes you back to the previous screen. There is an onscreen button that will bring up your most recently used apps, but we missed having a dedicated home key to get back to one of the three main home screens, especially when we were several menus deep. Having to hit the back button multiple times got old pretty quick.. There are other controls scattered around the edge of the phone. There's a 3.5mm headphone jack on top. In the upper left corner there's a volume rocker, and there's a camera activation/capture key and power button in the upper right corner. However, the volume and camera keys are in awkward positions. The volume rocker is too high up, so it's not easy to adjust the volume just by feel when on a call. Also, because the camera key sits off the edge and requires a pretty firm press, it's hard to hold the phone steady while trying to press the button, resulting in a blurry image.. The Kin One comes packaged in a cylindrical canister along with an AC adapter, a USB cable, a wired stereo headset, and reference material. For more add-ons, please read our cell phone accessories, ringtones, and help page .. Both the Kin One and Two use the same user interface. The software on both devices was created on the core elements of Windows Phone 7, but the user experience is designed completely around social communication, with the Loop home screen at the center of it all.. Loop displays all your contacts' updates and tweets from Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and Windows Live, and will also pull in any content from your subscribed news feeds. It retains a bit of the look and feel of Windows Phone 7 with the tile layout, and you can tap each tile to either read the full story or comment on a person's status. Information is shown in chronological order with the most recent news up top; as more updates and stories come in, stories are pushed down, but be aware that the screen doesn't pull data in real time but rather in 15-minute increments. Your status and image, however, always remain at the top, where you can instantly update your MySpace or Facebook status or send out a tweet by simply tapping the screen. One note about the social-networking integration: though you can upload photos to MySpace and Facebook, you can't upload to Twitter, which is unfortunate.. To the left of the Loop screen, you will find all the phone's apps, such as e-mail, music and videos, phone, browser, settings, and so forth. When you swipe to the right you'll find all your favorite contacts. You can have up to 51 favorites and adding contacts is simple. You can't change the size of the tiles, but you can rearrange them, as well as apps, by doing a two-finger tap on the screen.. The Kin One and Two aren't just about having access to information: they're also about sharing, and the phones have a unique way of doing so with a feature called the Spot. The Spot is literally a green dot at the bottom of all three home screens to which you can drag and drop content and then add contacts (also through drag and drop) with whom you want to share the information with via text/MMS or e-mail. You can share anything from the Loop screen, as well as Web pages, which we thought was pretty cool.. Best Phones for 2018. See All.

If you’re on Verizon or just want an interesting Microsoft off-shoot of their Windows Phone series, then the Kin One (a partnership with Sharp) may be for you. Plus you can have it for the low-low price of $25 (free shipping).. The Kin One, was a device released in April 2010 and can be considered part of the Microsoft-in-transition-what-the-hell-are-we-doing phase of the company. Seriously, Windows Phone 7 was just announced and prepping for release that fall when the Kin One (and Two) came along and confused everyone. What does it run? How is it related to Windows Phone? And most importantly, Why?. Fun fact: the Kin One and Two grew out of the secretive 'Project Pink' at Microsoft.... 600MHz ARM 11 Nvidia Tegra processor. 2.6-Inch TFT capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors. Internal 4 GB storage, 256MB RAM. 5 MP, 2592 x 1944 pixels, autofocus, dual-LED flash. Up to 200 hours of standby time. 82.6 x 63.5 x 19.1 mm (3.25 x 2.5 x 0.75 in). The Kin One and Two eventually flopped badly on Verizon and rumors have it that Big Red didn’t forgive the quickly cancelled fiasco with Microsoft. It’s often cited as one of the reasons why Windows Phone took time to creep onto the carrier and let’s face it, it wasn’t until the Lumia 822/HTC 8X/Samsung Odyssey and the recent Lumia 928 did Verizon take Windows Phone seriously.. What is interesting about the One (and Two) is you see a lot of precursors to the Windows Phone design, aesthetics, focus on social and perhaps a peek into Microsoft’s future. The Kin Studio was in many ways ahead of its time and while the device was a bomb, it has interesting aspects to it. Speaking of Kin Studio, it was killed off , meaning this phone and some of its cloud-based services have been knee-capped just a tad.. So what do you get for your $25? A 2010 era feature phone that focuses heavily on Twitter, Facebook, MySpace (LOL), web and music services. Plus you get a mini-chicklet keyboard.. And yes, we bought one to throw into our pile of reference devices, thank you.. Anyway, pick it up on Daily Steels (link below). Read our three-part review here: one , two and three ..

Microsoft Gets Social With New Kin Phones Microsoft Kin One and Kin Two Hands-On: Can Kin Phones Make Microsoft Cool Again? Video: Hands-On With the Kin One and Kin Two For Cellphones, It's Hip to Be Square. Microsoft's attempt to be hip and cool in mobile is a bust. The company has decided to stop introducing new Kin-branded phones and will scrap the device's European launch. Instead it plans to integrate Kin into its existing Windows 7 Phone team.. It will continue Kin sales in the United States, Microsoft said in a statement.. The move comes just two months after Microsoft introduced two phones under a new brand called Kin. The devices, called Kin One and Kin Two, were built with social networking services such as Facebook and Twitter at their core. Manufactured by Sharp for Microsoft, and available exclusively on Verizon Wireless, the phones were targeted at teens and social networking addicts.. But, from the start, Kin devices seemed doomed. The phones got tepid reviews and were plagued by reports of extremely poor sales .. Here are four reasons why we think the Kin failed:. Microsoft has been pouring resources into beefing up Windows Mobile and seems poised to introduce Windows Phone 7 in time for holiday season this year. But in a surprise move, Kin made its debut in April running a flavor of the new operating system.. Kin's OS isn't exactly Windows 7 Phone but it's not entirely a new operating system either, Microsoft executives attempted to explain. Call it a fork in the road of Windows Phone 7, they said at launch.. Kin had features such as easy sharing and automated backup that didn't seem part of the announced Windows Phone 7 OS. But that only confused mobile phone enthusiasts. Now Microsoft seems to realize splitting its OS brand could be a problem.. Microsoft executive Roz Ho who headed the Kin project, will "oversee" her team's move into the Windows Phone 7 fold, and then move to another role in the company, says Engadget .. The Kin isn't a smartphone, but it sure had a monthly cellphone plan priced like one.. At launch, the palm-sized Kin One – which had a 2.7-inch screen – cost $50 with a two-year Verizon contract, while the Kin Two with its 3.5-inch display cost $100. A few weeks later, Verizon dropped the price on the two phones to $80 and $30 respectively.. The fine print is in the monthly cellphone plan for the device. All Kin phones require a data plan. That means a $70 a month minimum on the bill.. For someone flipping burgers at McDonald's for their summer job, that's a lot of money to be handing over to a cellphone company.. If only Microsoft had offered all those social networking features on the Kin without requiring a data plan, Kin might have had a better shot at survival.. Though Kin forced a data plan on its users, they're not really smartphones.. Kin phones have a browser and can access social networking sites through widgets. But Microsoft crippled the overall functionality of the device by not allowing apps or games on the phone.. That means users ended up paying for a smartphone but got an amped-up feature phone instead.. Consumers, even teens, are smarter than that. Many just gave the Kin a pass.. Kin made a bold move into an extremely competitive cellphone market. But the devices lacked the cool factor and never really made it clear why a user would want a Kin over a Motorola Cliq or a HTC Hero.. Microsoft's marketing of the Kin seemed to make it worse. The company focused on projecting a faux hipster vibe for the product.. Kin would be a device that would make it easy to share photos, videos and access social networking feeds, promised Microsoft's ads.. However, almost every smartphone today can do that, and at times better than the Kin. At launch, Kin's Twitter client, for instance, was half-baked. Users couldn't view @ replies, search, or post photos. Similarly, Facebook features were limited to showing or posting status updates, though you could post photos.. What Microsoft failed to drive home were the truly innovative features of the phone – mainly the automated cloud backup. The Kin backs up the entire device, including photos, videos, message history and call log into a free online storage area that can be accessed from any browser – all without the user doing anything to trigger it. It's a feature that can come in handy when the phone is dead or missing.. But you wouldn't have known that from Microsoft's Kin ads.. *Top photo: Kin One and Kin Two *. gear Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+: Price, Specs, Release Date.

Thick body (0.73 inches inches). Low pixel density screen (154 ppi). The Microsoft KIN ONE has a slide-out portrait QWERTY keyboard and capacitive QVGA touchscreen, which will let you interact with the custom interface. It has a 5MP camera with flash and 4GB of internal storage space.. Microsoft KIN ONE and TWO Review Microsoft KIN ONE manual. Dimensions: 3.31 x 2.66 x 0.73 inches (84 x 68 x 19 mm). Weight: 3.90 oz (111 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Resolution: 320 x 240 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Talk time: 5.66 hours the average is 20 h (1229 min). Stand-by time: 8.8 days (210 hours) the average is 21 days (502 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. CDMA - Code Division Multiple Access. A technique of multiplexing, also called spread spectrum, in which analog signals are converted into digital form for transmission. For each communication channel, the signals are encoded in a sequence known to the transmitter and the receiver for that channel. The foremost application is digital cellular phone technology from QUALCOMM that operates in the 800MHz band and 1.9GHz PCS band. CDMA phones are noted for their excellent call quality and long battery life.. Notifications: Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Silent mode, Speakerphone. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 12 Apr 2010. Shopping information MSRP price: $ 50. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

Verizon - Verizon + Microsoft - Microsoft +. 3 Camera, Multimedia, GPS and Software. Introduction: The death of the long Sidekick line of handsets aimed at the hip, young, and connected individuals brought on the birth of Microsoft's foray into the market of manufacturing their own set of devices that contrasts closely to what the Sidekick tried to accomplish during its time. Microsoft has long been acquainted with the smartphone market, but now that Windows Phone 7 is expected to revamp things for the company later on in the year, it's going to be interesting to see how Microsoft's KIN devices will be able to attract customers – especially when it targets one specific demographic. Despite knowing its heavy focus on bringing social networking to the extreme on these handsets, KIN is able to stir up a new concept with the cloud based KIN Studio which offers owners a haven to experience the happenings in their daily lives. This isn't the first time we've seen devices mesh some social networking aspects, such as MOTOBLUR and webOS's Synergy, but it's safe to say that it seamlessly blends everything into a singular experience that removes some of the hassles of juggling multiple accounts. Naturally KIN greets us by saying “nice to meet you,” but will owners ultimately say the same after checking it out?. The Microsoft KIN package contains: •. Microsoft KIN ONE or TWO •. Product Safety & Warranty Guide Design: Without any major changes in design since the first leaked images of the two “Project Pink” devices came into fruition, the Microsoft KIN TWO isn't ground breaking in terms of design. Interestingly enough, it has a stark resemblance from afar with the Palm Pre , but we notice that it's slightly better built all around and the materials look to be more durable. The feel and look of the handset 's form factor is typical of what we would've expected, but it does feel rather noticeably heavier (4.7 oz) than its smaller brother. By no means does it try to beat out the slim look of the QWERTY-packing Motorola DROID , but rather, it's your normal looking device that blends into your pockets without adding much bulk (0.75” thick). Although it's mainly constructed out of plastic, the acrylic layer around the touchscreen makes it feel sturdier and less prone to scratching, but it's also a magnet for the usual finger prints and smudges. The rear cover has a subtle soft touch feel to it and tastefully repels most of the moisture from our hands while holding it. You can compare the Microsoft KIN TWO with many other phones using our Size Visualization Tool. The easiest distinction that the KIN TWO has over its brother is its 3.4” HVGA touchscreen that's both spacious and pleasing to the eyes. The themed colors does well in highlighting important text on the tiles and are easily legible thanks to the higher resolution. Although there are at times some lag or delayed responses when using the touchscreen, we believe it to be related to the software as opposed to the display – fortunately though it's accurate enough to the touch. However, the glossy acrylic coating on the touchscreen makes it difficult to view what's on- screen in direct sunlight, but the automatic brightness does well in offering the most optimal viewing. Only one hardware button adorns the face of the touchscreen and acts as the back function when pressed once, while holding it down will bring you back to the home screen; the KIN Loop. The button itself is slightly raised from the surrounding surface and wide enough with a good tactile feel to accompany it. All the other dedicated buttons can be found on the right side and are appropriatly located in the most comfortable positions except for the camera key which is awkwardly placed closer to the rear of the phone – which will require a firm grip with both hands to make sure that pressing it won't make the display move up. Thankfully the volume rocker and power button have a decent push to them, but we can't say the same for the camera button. Centered on the top edge of the phone is the standard 3.5mm headset jack while on the opposite bottom side there is a small opening for the microUSB port. The rear cover prominently displays the KIN name and the 8-megapixel auto-focus camera with LED flash while the notches on the left corners hide the speaker. Finally, removing the cover will only give you access to the 1390 mAh battery. Of all the areas on the phone, the QWERTY landscape keyboard is the only thing to pay homage to the Sidekick with its similarly-looking circular sized buttons. As much as we liked to use the Sidekick LX 's keyboard, we can't say the same for the KIN TWO. Although they're slightly raised and easily differentiated from one another thanks to some spacing in between each key, they felt somewhat stiff for the most part and made us wonder if the phone recognized our presses. Numbers are located on the top row and require the press of the dedicated single green button located on the bottom left area, but it would've been helpful if another one was located on the other side to alleviate the awkward position of fingers while typing. Additionally, the space button only has a distinct feel towards the left or right sides of it – hitting it squarely on the middle gives it that double push feel. We feel as though the real estate left unused on the QWERTY could've been used to add a few additional buttons to round out the experience. Not to be outdone by the better specs seen on the KIN TWO, the other half of Microsoft's tandem makes a larger impression in the design department. We were thoroughly surprised holding the hockey puck sized KIN ONE for the first time because it felt relatively compact and uniquely throws a bone to customers with its deceptively decent looks. Constructed out of the same plastic materials, which makes it feel light weight (3.9 oz), it is also accompanied with the acrylic layer for the touchscreen portion of the phone and the same somewhat soft touch material for the rear. Although it feels sturdy in the closed position, opening it however, we could feel that the mechanism that holds the two pieces in place felt a bit wiggly; just like the original Palm Pre. Despite that shortcoming, it doesn't take away from its eye catching looks. You can compare the Microsoft KIN ONE with many other phones using our Size Visualization Tool. Following it's “shrunken” design, the hardware specs follow suit as the 2.6” QVGA touchscreen is perfectly center aligned to the handset – where its attention is most prominent. Considered as being quaint by some of the high resolution displays out there, it's more than fitting with the KIN ONE's compact nature – although it's noticeable that the image quality is not as detailed as on the KIN TWO. The same acrylic layer is again overlaying the touchscreen which makes it difficult at times in viewing the display in direct sunlight. In addition, it's prone to the usual set of problems of attracting dirt and smudges that can tarnish its pristine glossy looks. Moreover, it's small real estate does pose a problem when trying to make out text on-screen as they are a bit hazy and don't have the fine details with the KIN TWO. The hardware button below the touchscreen acts similarly with the one on the KIN TWO as it's used as the back/home key – and it has that similar button feel to it. The left side of the phone houses the microUSB port while the well sized volume rocker is placed on the left corner of the phone. Conversely on the right edge of the phone are the dedicated power and camera button – the latter of the two is again located closer to the back of the phone and makes for some awkward finger placements when trying to press on it. You'll find the 3.5mm headset jack on the top side with a small notch for the speaker phone right next to it. Thankfully the 5-megapixel auto-focusing camera with LED flash is placed towards the top right area of the rear so that there's enough distance from the shutter key to prevent any fingers from moving into its view. Finally, the 1240mAh battery can be accessed by removing the back cover. Surprisingly, we were impressed by the KIN ONE's portrait style QWERTY keyboard which is probably more usable than the one of the KIN TWO. Slightly more oval looking buttons are used instead which doesn't make it feel too cramped thanks to the full utilization of the real estate of the phone. They're also slightly raised from the surface and offers a tiny bit better tactile feel over the KIN TWO. However, the same problem still plagues it because there is only a single green button, which acts as the function key, that slightly hinders the overall speed typing experience. At the same time, we did notice the same double push feel with the space button if it is hit squarely on the center – but with some practice, it becomes less of an issue..

These phones are good for social networking, but it's hard to justify paying $30 a month when you can buy an incredible. Even to get a palm pre would be less in cost (39 bucks now?), plus you get a top notch organizer, mobile hotspot and options for apps, nav, and youtube. Verizon needs to rethink the $30 data plan for this phone, or maybe work with microsoft and include a free zune pass with this phone- that would make for an appealing deal to kids, and would help parents justify that high cost of ownership.

Or just take a look at what Sprint is doing with Virgin Mobile (which is targeted at about the same demographic as these devices would be). I know Microsoft is going to be updating these devices, but as it stands, I don't think they're worth paying $30 a month for data.. (Posts: 742; Member since: 11 Dec 2008). posted on 08 May 2010, 18:20. Yeah 30.00/month data kills this phone and kills the market it is intended for... this phone is supposed to the Sidekick for a new generation. What parent would pay 30.00 for this phone phone's data... now 15.00 would be more reasonable. (Posts: 357; Member since: 14 May 2009). posted on 06 May 2010, 16:46.

Microsoft Kin One: Slick Software, Unimpressive Hardware. Microsoft Kin Two: Stylish, but Missing Some Key Features. Decent but Unattractive Hardware [ Further reading: The best Android phones for every budget. ] Kin OS: Intuitive, but Missing Key Features Good 5-Megapixel Camera Kin Studio: Useful but Problematic Clean Call Quality; Sometimes Sluggish Performance. The smaller of Microsoft's new social networking phones (the bigger and stronger model is the Kin Two ), the Kin One has a slick and intuitive user interface, but the hardware is middle-of-the-road and the phone can sometimes be sluggish. Additionally, advanced users might be disappointed with some limitations within the operating system.. Priced at $50 with a two-year contract from Verizon, including a mandatory $30 per month data plan (price as of May 4, 2010), the Kin One isn't the most stylish mobile device you'll ever see: Short and squat, it looks a bit dated. That said, the Kin One felt solid in my hands and fits easily in a pants pocket or purse. A Back button sits on the phone's face; on the top of the phone is a 3.5mm headphone jack sits on the top, flanked by a camera shutter button and volume rocker/digital zoom control. A power/unlock button rests on the right spine of the phone.. Though the 2.6-inch-diagonal display is a bit small for video playback, it's large enough for reading texts, browsing friends' status updates, and scrolling through contacts lists.. The keyboard's keys are spacious and boldly labeled, but they feel less comfortable than those on T-Mobile's Sidekick phones such as the Sidekick LX 3G (the design team behind the Sidekick phones played a big role in designing the Kin One and Kin Two). I also noticed a bit of lag between when I typed and when the characters appeared on the screen, which I found frustrating when hammering out a long e-mail. The few shortcut keys including a shortcut to the dialer, an emoticon key, and a search key for searching within your contacts and apps.. Despite being a bit overwhelming at first, Kin OS is visually pleasing and incredibly easy to navigate. The main screen, called Loop, displays your selected friends' status updates and messages, as well as your favorite RSS feeds, in a colorful collage of text and images. Flick to the left, and you'll see a panel containing all of your applications; flick right, and you'll see your contacts.. I also liked how easy sharing photos with my friends was via the Kin Spot. The Spot is a green circle that sits at the bottom of the user interface. If you want to share a photo, video, or news story from your RSS feed, simply drag and drop it into the Spot. Then, if you want to share the item, tap the Spot and choose either to send the link or file to your friends or upload it to one of your social networks.. Another highlight: The Kin One ships with the Zune HD media player for video and music playback. The Zune is gorgeous and definitely superior to the boring mobile Windows Media Player of the past. You also also get an FM radio capability; and if you have a Zune Pass subscription ($15/month), you can tag and buy songs you like on the radio from the Zune Marketplace.. Unfortunately, the Kin OS lacks some features that I consider are crucial for social networkers. There's no native calendar and no support for syncing your Outlook or Google calendars. If Kin's main goal is to connect people, why doesn't it provide a way to create and share events via a social calendar? Also conspicuously absent is any native IM client--a strange omission from a phone built for messaging. Finally, Kin doesn't support uploading photos or videos to Twitter. You can upload videos to your Facebook or MySpace profiles, but forget about Twitter. Microsoft says that it might add those features in future over-the-air updates, but don't expect them at launch.. Also, if you tend to use lots of apps, you'll be disappointed to learn that no software development kit is currently available for the Kin phones, nor is there an app store. For now, you're limited to what's preloaded on the device.. Overall, I was quite impressed with the Kin One's 5-megapixel camera. My outdoor snapshots looked terrific, with bright, natural colors and sharp details. The camera handled zooming well, too. Even when I reached the upper limit of the Kin One's 8X digital zoom, my subjects still looked pretty sharp.. The Kin One has a fairly powerful flash, too. Faces were nicely highlighted without being blown out. The combination of a good camera and a quick-upload feature make the Kin One an ideal companion for concerts, as you can snap high-quality pictures and share them easily with your friends or social networks.. Maximum video-clip length is disappointingly brief, at 1 minute. While recording, you'll see a counter that tells you how much time you have left for your video. Captured video looked pretty good when played back.. When you capture photos or videos on your Kin phone, it automatically uploads them to the Kin server; you can choose to geotag them automatically or manually. To view and share this content, you log in to your Kin Studio account on your PC--no need to deal with USB cables or microSD cards, and no tedious uploading procedure to step through. The feature seems ideal for the non-tech-savvy audience Microsoft targets with these phones.. Unfortunately, you can't delete photos from your phone without deleting them from Kin Studio. Of course, if you want to delete an incriminating photo taken at a bar the night before, you probably want remove all copies of it. But if you're deleting photos from your phone simply to free up storage space, you're going to start losing content fairly quickly, since the Kin One's memory is restricted to 4GB (with no microSD support). Realistically, 4GB of memory isn't enough to hold all of your photos, videos, and music.. I also wish that Microsoft had included photo editing or video editing software in Kine Studio. As matters stand, to edit a clip or photo, you have to download it to your PC, edit it in a third-party program, and then re-upload it to Kin Studio to share it with your friends.. The OS behaved a bit sluggishly as I navigated through various menus. Scrolling through my long list of contacts wasn't the smoothest of operations; the phone stuttered a bit as it loaded my contacts' information.. Call quality was clean over the Verizon network. My contacts reported that they could hear me loud and clear--even when I was speaking to them while standing on a busy street corner. My 3G service never dropped as I traveled all over the city of San Francisco.. The Kin One occupies an interesting position in Verizon's lineup. It is more affordable than the network's high-end smartphones, such as the HTC Droid Incredible and the Motorola Droid , but it has far fewer features and customization options. It will definitely satisfy social networkers--but perhaps not completely. The lack of apps and limitations within the OS might put off even novice smartphone users. And with sub-$100 smartphones like the Palm Pixi Plus ($30 with a two-year contract) available on the same network, it's hard to say how successful the Kin One (or the Kin Two) will be..

How the BMW M8 GTE got its track teeth. Microsoft Kin One and Kin Two official. Chris Davies - Apr 12, 2010. Microsoft’s Project Pink has finally matured into a couple of official devices, and if you were expecting a Zune phone then you might be a little surprised. The Microsoft Kin One and Kin Two – formerly known as the “Turtle” and “Pure” – are being positioned as feature phones for “Generation Upload”, with an emphasis both on social networking and on making sure Windows Phone 7’s toes don’t get stepped on.. Both handsets have a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, and the good news is that it’s a decent typing experience. Both use a capacitive, plastic touchscreen display, and the Kin One has a 5-megapixel camera and the Kin Two an 8-megapixel camera; each has an LED flash. Microsoft’s new homescreen is called Loop, and uses swipe-gestures for navigation; at the bottom of the screen there’s the Kin Spot to which you can drag content – such as images – to instantly share them. The different panes on Loop vary according to who you contact most often, who you tell the Kin phones you’re most interested in, and the media you access the most.. The Kin One has 4GB of storage while the Kin Two gets 8GB; that’s your lot, too, since there’s no memory card slot, though Microsoft do back up all photos, videos and messages in the cloud. Social networking support includes content sharing with MySpace, Facebook, Windows Live and Twitter, though at present you can’t upload photos or video to Twitter, and there’s no instant messaging client. There’s also a very definite differentiation between the Kin range and Windows Phone 7, down to basic functionalities like the Kin handsets having no calendar app or app store.. As for Zune, there’ll be Zune video and music support – including optional Zune Pass subscriptions – but no games, and there’s a PC management app that’ll be used to control content together with a basic Mac side-loading app. The Kin One has a mono speaker while the Kin Two gets stereo speakers, and of course both have a 3.5mm headphone jack together with an FM radio.. Microsoft haven’t confirmed what sort of battery life we can expect from the two handsets, but we’re guessing with regular media sharing over 3G you’ll be looking at a daily recharge. Expect to see the Kin One and Kin Two arrive on Verizon in May 2010, while a Vodafone Europe launch in Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom is expected this fall. No word on pricing as yet.. Microsoft Ushers in the Next Generation of the Social Phone With KIN, a New Windows Phone. Microsoft, Sharp, Verizon Wireless and Vodafone unveil KIN, a new Windows Phone designed for broadcasting and sharing everyday moments.. — April 12, 2010 — Microsoft Corp. today announced KIN, a new Windows® Phone designed specifically for people who are actively navigating their social lives. Brought to life through partnerships with Verizon Wireless, Vodafone and Sharp Corporation, KIN is designed to be the ultimate social experience that blends the phone, online services and the PC with breakthrough new experiences called the Loop, Spot and Studio. KIN will be exclusively available from Verizon Wireless in the U.S. beginning in May and from Vodafone this autumn in Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.. KIN is a new social experience from Microsoft Corp. that combines the phone, online services and the PC. “Working closely with our partners, we saw an opportunity to design a mobile experience just for this social generation — a phone that makes it easy to share your life moment to moment,” said Robbie Bach, president of the Entertainment and Devices Division at Microsoft. “We built KIN for people who live to be connected, share, express and relate to their friends and family. This social generation wants and needs more from their phone. KIN is the one place to get the stuff you care about to the people you care about most.”. A New Kind of Social Phone. With KIN, social networking is built into the fabric of the phone. KIN has a fun, simple interface, which is designed to help people publish the magazine of their life by making the people and stuff they love the focus rather than menus and icons. The unique hardware design was developed in partnership with Sharp to create a new kind of social phone. There are two models called KIN ONE and KIN TWO. Both phones feature a touch screen and slide-out keyboard. ONE is small and compact, making it a perfect fit for a pocket and to operate with one hand. TWO has a larger screen and keyboard, in addition to more memory, a higher resolution camera, and the ability to record high-definition video. The 5 and 8 megapixel cameras in ONE and TWO, respectively, are designed for use in low light with image stabilization and a bright LumiLED flash.. The home screen of the phone is called the KIN Loop, which is always up to date and always on, showing all the things happening in someone’s social world. KIN automatically brings together feeds from leading Microsoft and third-party services such as Facebook, MySpace and Twitter all in one place, making it easier to stay connected. Customers can also select their favorite people, and KIN will automatically prioritize their status updates, messages, feeds and photos. Another unique feature, the KIN Spot is a new way for people to share what’s going on in their world. It lets them focus first on the people and stuff they want to share rather than the specific application they want to use. Videos, photos, text messages, Web pages, location and status updates are shared by simply dragging them to a single place on the phone called the Spot. Once all the people and content are in the Spot to share, the consumer can choose how to share, and start broadcasting.. KIN Studio is your phone online. Almost everything created on the phone is available in the cloud from any Web browser. Photos and videos are freed from the confines of the phone and presented in an online visual timeline so they are easy to view and share. The KIN Studio automatically backs up texts, call history, photos, videos and contacts, and populates a personalized digital journal so it’s easy to go back in time to relive a crazy weekend or recent birthday. And the KIN Studio gives customers tons of storage to keep all those photos, videos, contacts and texts so they’ll never run out of space on their phone and lose a memory.. KIN will be the first Windows Phone to feature a Zune experience — including music, video, FM radio and podcast playback. With a Zune Pass subscription, customers using Zune software on their PC can listen to millions of songs from Zune Marketplace on their KIN while on the go, or load their personal collection. KIN also has other features customers want in a phone including a rich browser with the ability to share pieces of the Web, local and Web search by Bing, and an RSS feed reader to pull down information on people and stories from the Web..

The Kin One makes a decent music player for music, yes, but its screen is too small and too square for enjoyable video viewing. Even with a bigger screen, the Kin Two’s low-resolution (HVGA) LCD lacks the deep color and contrasts of the varying higher-resolution Motorola Droid screens.. The Kins are Zunes with a cell phone built in. You sideload music, videos and pictures content via the Zune online client, which wasn’t as easy or as quick as it should have been. But playing back music isn’t exactly intuitive. To get on-screen transport controls – to even get a song playing – you oddly have to tap a volume control key. The whole music-playing experience is unnecessarily confusing.. Oddly, neither Kin let’s you use music tracks as ringtones.. Both Kins sound a bit hollow, but no more than any halfway decent cell phone. There could be a bit more volume, however, and you’d think there would be some noise canceling considering this is a phone designed for social young adults. Both phones also lack volume and aural quality on the speakerphone for voice and music.. As noted, there is no dedicated send button to get directly to either phone’s dialer. The dialer on the Kin One, not surprisingly, offers small touch-screen keys, which make it easy to misdial. Touch keys on the Kin Two are just as tightly packed, but larger and easier to tap quickly.. Getting phone numbers into your contact list is an issue. The Kin imports your Facebook and MySpace contacts, but if your friends don’t add their phone numbers to their profiles, you won’t get them, and you’ll have to annoyingly add each manually.. Microsoft has created a new way of sending e-mails and media to multiple recipients. At the bottom of every Kin screen, is a Spot. You tap, hold, then drag contact icons, photos, Web pages, or anything sendable to the Spot. Tap the Spot to choose how you want to send it. As with the whole Kin experience, the Spot is decidedly different and adds a bit of existential cell fun, but I’m not sure it’s better than traditional methods of building a “send to” list and adding attachments.. Microsoft Kin One Compared To. Scrolling through lists on the capacitive touch-screen is not as smooth as it is on other touch-screen phones.. Both Kins deliver a clean, but slower-than-average EVDO browsing experience, with pages on mobile-oriented sites such as CNN, The New York Times and ESPN needing six or more seconds to load, although links within these sites snap into place a bit faster.. Even though both Kins have an external camera shutter key, the round silver button is too flush to the surface to be of any practical use. Plus, when you try to push it on the Kin Two to snap a picture, the QWERTY tray starts to slide open, causing the whole phone to quiver and the photo to blur.. The Kin Two sports an 8-megapixel imager, the Kin One a 5-megapixel. Both take excellent photos for a cell phone, although as usual, when blown up, you’ll detect digital extrapolation smudge and lack of detail and focus away from the center. Oddly, the Kin One has a wider angle lens than its larger sibling, which means you get more image in your Kin One snaps. You can turn the geo-tagging on and off, although we can’t imagine why you wouldn’t want it always on.. Even with a flash on each phone, indoor shots are still dark.. The Kin One captures VGA (640 x 480) video, while the Kin Two shoots in high-definition 720p (1280 x 720). The problem is getting this higher-def footage out of the camera. Kin.com doesn’t automatically upload high-quality video, just low-res footage. Since there’s no removable microSD card, and neither phone will let you add the video as an e-mail attachment, you’ll need to physically connect the phone to a computer and sync it to transfer footage.. Microsoft doesn’t supply rated talk times, which makes sense. In a phone designed primarily for non-verbal communications, rated talk time is pretty much irrelevant. The Kin One is rated for up to 8.75 days of standby, and the Kin Two for 9.7 days, which are both above average.. Microsoft’s Kin OS make the specialized Kins seem kind of alien, and it’s an acquired taste. It would be foolhardy for us to express an opinion on the look and feel, since some people will cozy right up to its unusual social network approach. You won’t take to the Kins if you’re more verbal and want a multi-function device – in other words, neither is a Droid alternative. Between the two, the Kin OS is too big and too cluttered for the cute Kin One. Neither phone is helped by their slipperiness or their impossible to feel-by-touch external controls. But if texting and keeping up with your virtual friends is all you want from a mobile device, either Kin can cleverly keep you connected.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

Tired Screen too small for much reading or web browsing. Video recording is only standard definition. Doesn't integrate with Google contacts or calendar. $50 (after $100 mail-in rebate, with 2-year contract). Author: Dylan Tweney Dylan Tweney. Should you get either one? Read on, we'll tell ya.. Verizon's newest phones, the Microsoft-designed and Sharp-manufactured Kin One and Kin Two, put social media front and center.. More capable than cheap, feature-sparse dumbphones, but quite a few IQ points shy of being true smartphones, the Kins are the latest entrants in a new space where traditional phone features are almost an afterthought, and it's all about the Twitter and Facebook updates.. Palm's Web OS, Motorola's Blur interface, and other Android-based phone operating systems have been doing this kind of social media integration for more than a year. Kin just takes that idea and improves on it.. On the home screen (what Microsoft calls the Loop), a pleasingly formatted stack of randomly sized squares shows the latest updates from your networks. Your friends' avatars are shown large, filling the background of each text update, making the Loop into a photo album as well as news feed. It's hard to look at it without smiling.. Flick the touchscreen to the left to reveal your favorite contacts, swipe the other way to access a vertical stack of applications (text messaging, phone calls, web browsing, music and more.) A camera button activates a still/video camera function, and a Back button on the phone's face takes you back to whatever screen you were looking at before. And that's about it: The phone's interface is amazingly uncluttered, friendly looking and minimalist.. The system still has some glitches to work out. As a Twitter client, it's only half baked, since you can't view @ replies, search or post photos. Similarly, Facebook features are limited to showing or posting status updates, though you can post photos. The phone will easily connect with a Gmail account to display your e-mail, but won't let you access your Gmail contacts. Hotmail or Windows Live user? You're in luck, the Kin is well-integrated with those services.. YouTube videos won't play at all on the Kin, there's no map application, and even though the "Bing Near Me" search button helps find nearby restaurants and cafes, it relies on a browser interface, not a map: Clunky.. Overall, the Kin OS is promising, entertaining and — despite some obvious glitches — fairly well-suited to its target audience of social media addicts: in other words, tweens. How does the hardware stack up? Read on.. The smaller of the two, the Kin One is a petite, rounded square of plastic with a tiny screen and a keyboard that slides out from underneath. It's almost impossibly cute and surprisingly functional for a phone that could easily be mistaken for a compact.. The touchscreen is just 1.5 inches tall by 2 inches wide, but its resolution (240 x 320 pixels) is up to the task of displaying your slice of the digital world — at least, that part of it that is posted in 160 characters or less.. A 5-megapixel camera (with a tiny LED light for illumination) takes OK pictures, though it had some trouble focusing on closeup objects in our tests.. The keyboard, though puny, is surprisingly easy to use. One mystery: The bottom, keyboard part of the phone's body protrudes a half-centimeter beyond the screen portion on the bottom and the top edges of the phone. Why the designers didn't just make the screen a little larger and go for a perfectly flush look is a puzzler.. The company claims its batteries will last for more than eight days on standby, and in our tests, it was about exhausted after a full day of heavy use.. For $50 with a two-year contract, the Kin One has a temptingly small sticker price, but don't be fooled: The contract demands a minimum of $70 per month for voice and data service, which means your total cost will be at least $3,410. That's a steep price for keeping your kids up-to-date with the latest on Facebook and Twitter.. But if all you want is a tiny, compact social communications device, and you've got a deep pocketbook, the Kin One is an adorable choice. We're looking forward to seeing more phones like it.. The Kin Two, with its 3.5-inch, 480-by-320-pixel display, isn't particularly innovative in its design or features. It does what Microsoft is known for best: Come into the game late and copy an idea well enough to make it cheaper and sometimes, just sometimes a little better.. When it comes to the hardware, the Kin Two proves you get what you pay for. The 4.8-ounce phone doesn't have a solid body, the plastic casing is flimsy and the keys on the slide-out QWERTY keyboard aren't soft or easy to peck on.. But what the phone lacks in looks, it does make up in technical artillery. The Nvidia Tegra processor is zippy, the touchscreen is smooth and the 8-megapixel camera, with an LED flash, delivers some good photos in low light. Unlike the Kin One, it can shoot HD video.. With a larger body comes more screen real estate and a larger keyboard, and that makes the Kin Two potentially more powerful than its little sister. The lack of an onscreen keyboard is a surprising omission, leaving you with no alternative but to flip the phone to the landscape mode if you want to type anything.. Overall, the Kin Two lacks the panache of the tiny, squarish Kin One, however, and invites comparison with smarter phones in the same form factor, like Motorola's Devour, Backflip and Droid, and Samsung's Behold II.. Like the Kin One, the Kin Two requires a two-year voice and data contract with a $70 per month minimum, bringing its total cost to $3,460. Unless you're some sort of iced out playa ballin' out of control, you're better off buying your progeny a feature phone and making them use SMS like all the other kids..

World Tech Update: New TSA rules take flight. [ Further reading: The best Android phones for every budget. ] Microsoft Kin: Always Connected, Some of the Time. Call me crazy, but something about Microsoft's Kin phone just doesn't add up.. The Kin, unveiled by Microsoft on Monday, is billed as a mobile phone for the "social generation." It's meant to appeal to the younger, always-connected crowd -- teens and 20-somethings who spend their days surfing social networks -- and yet the Kin's social network support is decidedly unrobust.. Much has been made over what Microsoft's Kin phone is missing : There are no apps, there's no Flash, and there are no games. And all of that is a bit baffling. But there are other features even more core to the social networking experience that are even more conspicuously absent.. The most glaring thing missing from the always-connected phone is, quite simply, the ability to remain always-connected. In his introduction of the Kin, Microsoft Entertainment and Devices President Robbie Bach described the device as a "mobile experience just for this social generation -- a phone that makes it easy to share your life moment to moment.". His statement seemingly needed a footnote: "...if by 'moment to moment,' you mean 'on 15-minute intervals.'". The Kin, you see, revolves around a home screen setup known as "The Loop." It streams all your latest status updates and messages and makes it easy for you to reply.. Here's the problem: The Kin, Microsoft confirmed to me, syncs those updates only once every 15 minutes. This is done in the name of battery life -- a spokesperson says Microsoft wanted the phone to be able to last for a full weekend on a single charge -- but for a device whose primary selling point is being "the phone you use to be the first to comment on a Facebook photo," a nonoptional and never-ending 15-minute delay cycle seems to have "oxymoron" written all over it.. That issue aside, the Kin is lacking a number of other basic features one would think might be crucial to any enthusiastic social networker. Microsoft's Kin has no instant messaging client, no appointment calendar, and no universal inbox. There's no photo or video editing, and while the Kin does offer seamless photo and video uploading to certain social services, Twitter is not among them. The lack of Flash also presents potential problems with Web video playback, and the lack of any app support makes it impossible to correct any of these omissions with third-party programs.. Now, the Kin is clearly not designed for the diehard Microsoft fanboy ; he'd be more apt to snatch up a full-featured Windows Phone 7 device. But even given the Kin's more carefully targeted demographic, I'm confused: Why would members of the "social generation" veer toward the Kin over a relatively inexpensive smartphone that can do so much more?. The Kin's "Loop" is more or less the same as Motorola's Blur interface , which brings a social networking backdrop to the home screens of Android handsets like the Cliq and Backflip. And there's always the iPhone, which -- while it doesn't have a widget-based home screen option -- has plenty of feature-rich social networking applications. With both the Backflip and the iPhone selling for $99, unless the Kin comes with a dirt-cheap data plan, it's going to have a tough time winning the price war by much.. Microsoft's mysterious "Project Pink" could have been so many fascinating things. But after the years of development, I have to question whether its result -- the Kin -- can seriously compete in today's overflowing mobile market .. Hey, maybe I'm just too surly to understand what the Kin's target audience truly wants. No matter how hard I try to summon my inner Justin Bieber, though, I can't for the life of me figure out what Microsoft was thinking..

Trending — You Say Goodbye and We Say Hello. ethics statement bio e-mail RSS Follow @inafried. It’s B-a-a-ck — Deals Site Offers the Microsoft Kin One for $25. June 12, 2013 at 10:10 am PT. If you didn’t get a chance to buy Microsoft’s ill-fated Kin phone during the month or so it was on sale back in 2010, you have another chance.. Deal site Daily Steals is offering the Verizon phone for $25. However, buyer beware: You are mostly paying to own a piece of tech history.. The Kin, which was being developed alongside Windows Phone 7, was designed to target the youth market, with much of its power coming from cloud-synced services to make text messages and photos accessible to the Web. But, with no access to apps and competing against more capable phones, it was scrapped after little more than a month on the market.. Microsoft shut down most of the Kin services shortly after it discontinued the phone. So, basically, buyers are getting a feature phone.. : The Daily Steals ad says “powered by Windows Phone 7” but don’t believe what you read. Windows Phone 7 apps won’t run on the device..

First Looks | Microsoft Kin One (Verizon Wireless) |. Oppo Unveils the F1s smartphone in India. Reliance LYF Smartphones Get A Price Cut. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.. First Looks Microsoft Kin One ... Editor Rating: Good (3.0) Oct 06, 2010. Automatically backs up photos and messages.. Not really a smartphone, but priced like one.Watch the Microsoft Kin One!. The Microsoft Kin One could have been a cute messaging phone, but it's being sold as an under-powered smartphone.. The Microsoft Kin One is a well-designed, cute little messaging phone in the spirit of the T-Mobile Sidekick ($49.99, ). Along with its sibling the Kin Two, it's one of the first Zune phones and the closest you'll get to Windows Phone 7 before "the holidays." Had it been free with contract or on a prepaid plan, the Kin One could have kicked other texting phones to the curb. But Verizon has made the Kin One more expensive to own than the Palm Pre Plus ($29.99, )and in that company, the Kin phones look downright crippled.. Microsoft is releasing two Kin phones with Verizon. The Kin One is a jaunty little slider that fits easily in one hand, at the cost of a cramped screen and only 4GB for music and video storage. We cover the Kin Two in an associated review .. At 3.25 by 2.5 by .75 inches (HWD) and 3.9 ounces, the Kin One is an alien-looking little oval. Closed, it shows a finger-width of white bezel both above and below the black screen. Slide up the screen to find rounded, well-separated keys floating on a white background. The whole look is more imaginative and better-built than the Kin Two; because you can hold it in one hand it's easier to take photos, for instance. And the Kin One has a certain finesse that competing messaging phones like the Samsung Alias 2 ($29.99, ) lack. The Kin One's small form factor is appealing, but the 2.6-inch, 320-by-240 capacitive touch screen kills the attraction. There's just not enough room on this screen: you can see two e-mail subject lines (as opposed to five on the Kin Two), six menu options (as opposed to ten), or two social-networking updates (as opposed to four.) It just feels cramped.. The Kin One makes phone calls on Verizon's CDMA network and connects to the Internet either through Verizon's 3G EVDO Rev A system or Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g. Neither Kin is the greatest voice phone, but the Kin One falls a little behind its larger sibling. Sound through the earpiece was fine, but my voice heard on the other side of the call sounded muddy and computery at times, with considerable amounts of background noise coming through. The speakerphone was just barely loud enough for outdoor usethe Kin Two has a much louder speakerphone. The Kin One paired with our Aliph Jawbone Icon ($99, ) Bluetooth headset to make calls, but the phone doesn't have voice dialing. You can't use your own music as ringtones, either. Battery life was fine at just under five and a half hours of talk time.. The Kin runs its own OS, which has a lot in common with but is not quite the upcoming Windows Phone 7. For one thing, the Kin has no downloadable apps. That's it: what you see is what you get, plus whatever over-the-air updates Microsoft will choose to send down. The Kin is actually more akin to a texting phone than to a modern smartphone, as smartphones continually grow and change with new apps.. The Kin's interface doesn't look or work like anything else you've ever seen. It's a little like the Zune, but even that isn't going to help you much.. When you hit the phone's wake-up button, you see what appear to be the handwritten words, "nice to meet you." Drag the corner of the page up to show the Loop, the Kin's "home page" of social networking updates, as bold and messy as a teenager's room. Swipe left to see the main menubig blocks of text and graphicsand swipe right to see your favorite people as a jigsaw-puzzle of photos.. The Kin ingests MySpace, Facebook and Twitter accounts, as well as Exchange, Gmail, Yahoo, Windows Live, and POP3/IMAP e-mail. But it doesn't do as much with those accounts as the competition does. Contacts come from Windows Live, MySpace, Facebook, and Exchange. You can't integrate someone's Twitter or Gmail information into their contact card if it isn't in Facebook.. Contact integration in general isn't as good as you'd see on an HTC phone like the Droid Incredible or Droid Eris ($79.99, ). There's no way to see all of your communication with someone from their contact card. You can swipe over to their Facebook Wall, but you don't get to see all the texts or e-mails you sent with the person connected to their address card.. The Loop, the Spot, and the Studio. Three features define the Kin experience: the Loop, the Spot, and the Studio. The Loop is the Kin's home page, and it should be a continuous feed of social-networking updates and your favorite RSS feeds. It's quite satisfying if you use Facebook and MySpace, and less so if you use Twitter, as your Twitter and Facebook contacts aren't matched up and so the updates seem to be coming from separate people. Tapping on an update lets you comment on a Facebook or MySpace message; for Twitter and RSS feeds, you can open them in the browser. E-mails and texts, annoyingly, are out of the Loopthey just don't appear on that screen.. The Spot lets you share stuff. As you wander through your phone experience, you can tap on itemsTwitter updates, photos, even Web pagesand dump them on the Spot, to be later packaged up and either uploaded to a social-networking service or sent by text or e-mail.. The Studio is the best thing about the Kin. Several of the things you do on the Kin are automatically backed up into a password-protected Web site that shows a timeline of what you've done on your phone: every phone call, every text message, every photo taken. It doesn't show your e-mails, but presumably you have those somewhere else. You can download your photos and messages, and prune your address book, from the Studio. The Studio isn't Microsoft-centric; while it requires Silverlight, I ran it in Firefox on both Windows Vista and Mac OS X 10.5.. The Kin's Internet Explorer-based Web browser is excellent, though it has a few usability quirks. Desktop pages display very accurately, and you can pinch to zoom and add visual bookmarks of your favorite pages. But since the browser seems to identify itself as Mobile IE, you often get stripped-down "mobile" versions of pages when the Kin is perfectly capable of showing full pages. As you could expect, the Web experience is a heck of a lot better on the large-screen Kin Two than on the small-screen Kin One.. I easily loaded and synced Exchange, Gmail, and Yahoo accounts, but more complicated HTML emails wouldn't view at all. The Kin phones also integrate Bing local and Web search through a dedicated button that also does a very limited local search, of contacts and apps only.. The Kin One includes a built-in Zune HD ($199-$269, )for free!sort of. The phone has 4GB of built-in storage, but there is no memory card slot, so you'll run out of room pretty quickly if you're into video.. Under an icon marked "Music & More," you can access a full set of Zune functions, including an analog FM radio, and they work just like a Zune. To get music and video on or off the Kin, you sync it with the Zune Player on a PC using an included MicroUSB cable, or with upcoming Mac software that Microsoft pledges to make available soon. I found music, videos, podcasts and photos synced two ways, and they sounded good both over wired and Bluetooth headsets. The Kin One's small screen made videos feel cramped, but even high-def videos were automatically scaled down to 320-by-240 by the Zune software, with no loss of smoothness.. The Kin One's 5-megapixel camera geotags photos with your location (even indoors), but it isn't the best phone camera out there. In low light, images got blurry easily. Outdoors, focus felt soft and light sources seemed to overwhelm the sensor. The Kin One's video mode records washed-out but sharp VGA videos.. A short list of what's missing: no apps, no instant messaging, no calendar, and no GPS navigation. With the right service plan, the Kin phones could still have cleaned up. The Kin One may have a cramped screen, but it's awfully adorable, and its social-networking affinities and physical style beat any texting phone on the market.. Unfortunately, it's not being sold as a texting phone. The HTC Incredible and Motorola Devour ($149.99, ) both have better social-networking support, and all smartphones have lots of games and add-on programs to make them even better. So why is Verizon putting the Kin One on the same $30 a month data plan as the far-superior HTC Incredible, Droid Eris, and Palm Pre Plus? A Verizon rep let the sad reason slip: because Kin owners will use the Internet, so Verizon wants to charge based on potential heavy Internet use.. At the price Verizon is charging, it's hard for me to recommend the Kin One over the Palm Pre Plus, Motorola Devour, or other smartphones. If potential Kin buyers can afford more than a texting phone, they will be better served by a phone that grows with a thriving third-party apps community.. Continuous Talk Time: 5 hours 22 minutes.
