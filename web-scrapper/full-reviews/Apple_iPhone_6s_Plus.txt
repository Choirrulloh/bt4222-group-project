The Good Improved speed, better cameras, always-on Siri, and pressure-sensitive 3D Touch display compared to last year's 6 Plus. And it has slightly better battery life, a bigger higher resolution screen, and optical image stabilization for photos and video that can make a difference.. The Bad It's really big. It costs more than the smaller iPhone. Other phablet-sized phones offer longer battery life.. The Bottom Line The iPhone 6S Plus has a few key advantages that give it an edge for serious iPhone users, but its big body still may not fit for a lot of people.. iPhone 6S next to 6S Plus. What do I mean by 'too big'? Left to right: Samsung Galaxy Note 5, iPhone 6S Plus and Google Nexus 6. Super-powered with 3D Touch and better speed 3D Touch has potential, but takes getting used to. Fall leaves, shot on 6S Plus rear camera. Cameras: A reason to upgrade for serious users Dark lab, full-size photo, 6S. Editors' note : On September 7, 2016, Apple debuted the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , and discontinued the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus remain available, however, and Apple has increased the storage capacity of the entry-level models to 32GB and lowered their prices by $100, £100 and AU$190. The full iPhone 6S Plus review, first published in October 2015, follows.. iOS 10: All the new features, tips and guides. 23 hidden features in iOS 10. 15 ways iOS 10 will make the iPhone better. I don't usually like really big phones. I want phones that can fit in my hand. But last year I switched from an iPhone 6 to 6 Plus , to see what difference it made it my life. Its advantages turned out to be really useful : a bigger battery, a larger screen with higher resolution. And I realized, when I switched back to an iPhone 6, that optical image stabilization made a difference, too...sometimes.. I missed the surer, clearer pictures in low light that the Plus gave in a pinch in darkened press rooms during live events. (For better or worse, that's the sort of place where I need good smartphone photography in a pinch.). Our London outing with the bold iPhone 6S Plus (pictures). And yes, I came to love the Plus for its pro-type features, and even for its near-tablet feel. But as a normal phone, its size never seemed truly comfortable to me.. Just like last year, the new iPhone 6S Plus and iPhone 6S are nearly similar except for a few key advantages on the larger model. The Plus gets you a 5.5-inch display instead of the 4.7-inch one of the iPhone 6S. And while the Plus's camera sensor and resolution is identical to that on the smaller iPhone, it adds optical image stabilization, which can deliver more blur-free photos in certain light conditions (especially if you're zooming). Unlike last year's Plus, that stabilization works when shooting videos, too. And you get a bigger battery that lasts just a bit longer. It costs more, but its perks are worth it if you're a mission-critical user of your phone camera.. I'd probably use a Plus over a 6S. But for most people, I still think the smaller 6S is the way to go.. For some people, the Plus might not be too big at all. But for many others I've talked to, it is. There's nothing wrong with a 5.5-inch screen, but the 6S Plus -- like the 6 Plus before it -- seats that screen into a phone that has a larger top and bottom bezel than many big-screened Android phones. End result: it's wider and longer than similar 5.5-inch competitors, albeit thinner. See the photo below for comparison, next to the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and last year's Nexus 6. The Note 5 is a tiny bit less wide and tall, but has a larger 5.7-inch screen. The thicker and ever-so-slightly wider Nexus 6 has a 5.9-inch screen.. The width and length usually make more of a difference to me, and my pants. I have pretty large jeans, and my pockets accommodate the Plus fine. Other people I know don't have that luck.. The Plus still doesn't fit easily in one hand, either. I find myself using a pinky tucked underneath.. You do get a 5.5-inch 1,920x1,080 resolution display instead of the 4.7-inch 1,334x750-resolution screen of the iPhone 6S, which matters mostly for photos, videos, and Web browsing. You can fit a bit more of everything on screen at once, as long as apps take advantage (many do, some still haven't upgraded).. For more on what the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus offer, read my whole iPhone 6S review. Know that the new A9 processor and double the RAM (2GB) from last year's iPhones means faster-feeling system speed, and apps that load better when you swap between them. And the extra perk of always-on Siri means that, especially for drivers, hands-free operation works even the phone's not plugged in.. 3D Touch is the promise of a whole new type of interaction with the touchscreen; this phone has a pressure-sensitive display that does different things when you press in with your finger. Everything from pop-out menus to previews of Web links before you open them, and a growing library of apps and games that are starting to make the most of this tech. It can measure a whole range of pressure gradients, which means this could be used for sketching and art apps in particular. On a larger-screened tablet-type phone, that could get very interesting. At the moment, however, 3D Touch is more subtle additions and potential than anything eye-popping or world-changing. It's definitely worth keeping an eye on, however, because iOS is bound to transform to take advantage of it down the road.. I'm about to show you an extreme example of why optical image stabilization matters.. I took a photo in the nearly-dark CNET PC lab using the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.. As you can see, these photos are pretty similar. To a casual eye, not much is different. But! Then I digital-zoomed all the way in on our grimy test keyboard and snapped a photo..

The Global Score is arrived at only after curating hundreds, sometimes thousands of weighted data points (such as critic and user reviews).. The iPhone 6s Plus has 3D Touch, iOS 9, a pair of improved cameras and the powerful A9 chipset, just like its smaller sibling. A long-lasting battery and optical image stabilization for its 12-megapixel rear camera help give the iPhone 6s Plus a slight edge over the regular 6s, although we wish it were a little easier to hold.. 3D Touch is a smart, helpful addition. Touch ID is faster and more accurate. Great camera helped by optical image stabilization. Base model still only has 16GB of storage. Touch ID can be overly sensitive. Can be hard to use with one hand. This iPhone improves on an already solid iPhone 6 Plus. If you're in the market for something not Android or Windows Phone..Look no...

The Good Compared to iPhone 6, it has improved speed everywhere (new processor, faster wireless, quicker Touch ID sensor); a sturdier body; better front and rear cameras; and a bold new 3D Touch pressure-sensitive display which offers new iOS shortcuts.. The Bad It has the same battery life as the iPhone 6. You'll need to buy a larger iPhone 6S Plus or upgrade to an iPhone 7 for better battery life, plus optical image stabilization for photos and video.. The Bottom Line The iPhone 7 may be the new hot stuff, but -- particularly with a price drop and a storage upgrade -- the iPhone 6S is still a great deal.. Update, September 2016 A faster quad-core processor (we're still testing this) A brighter screen A better camera (finally with optical image stabilization!) A water-resistant case Stereo speakers Double the storage for the same price Two additional hours of battery life. Pop-up menus: one of the new features of 3D Touch. 3D Touch: Amazing hardware needs killer software 3D Touch turns the keyboard into a trackpad. What my family and friends thought Rose gold is more like rose. The iPhone 7 is here, and there's very little question that it'll be a better phone than the iPhone 6S. The new iPhone 7 ditches the headphone jack.. But is it a better phone for you ?. As rumored, the new iPhones no longer have a headphone jack, and the new Home button (which doesn't actually press down anymore) can feel a little weird. The phone's design hasn't changed much at all, except for a slight redesign to the antennas around back. ( Here's the full list of changes. Those could be reason enough to stick with the iPhone 6S, particularly because the 6S is already good enough for practically anything you'd want to do. But there's also a new reason to buy the iPhone 6S: Apple has doubled the storage and reduced the price in one fell swoop.. While you'd previously have to pay $649, £539 or AU$1,079 for a 16GB iPhone 6S, you'll now be able to have a more spacious 32GB model for just $549, £499 or AU$929 off-contract.. It's never been a better time to buy last year's iPhone.. Editors' note: The original Apple iPhone 6S review, published in October 2015 and updated since then, follows.. When I showed the iPhone 6S to one of my wife's friends, she got nostalgic. She waxed emotional about its predecessor, the iPhone 6. Bigger screen, better camera, and Apple Pay. It was as close to a perfect phone as I've ever seen. All it ever really lacked was a better battery (Plus notwithstanding).. iOS 10: All the new features, tips and guides. 23 hidden features in iOS 10. 15 ways iOS 10 will make the iPhone better. I showed her 3D Touch, Apple's newest technology on these iPhones. She pressed on the hypnotically-animated lock screen, a swimming fish. She watched it dance under her finger. But when I showed her everything else 3D Touch does, she said, "I'm not sure I'd really use this.". This year's follow-up iPhone, the iPhone 6S, doesn't improve on that battery. And its newest features aren't as instantly game-changing, at least not on the surface. That's obvious: it's an S-year iPhone, and Apple always uses these subtle every-other-year S upgrades to tweak design and ramp up processor speeds. It's the phone for people who didn't get the iPhone 6 last year. And for the past few years, S phones have introduced evolutionary changes that seriously evolved the phone; the iPhone 4S added Siri, and the iPhone 5S debuted the Touch ID fingerprint sensor.. The new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus look the same (except for the metallic-pink rose gold model) as last year's iPhones. In a lot of ways they also feel the same. But there are hidden advantages at play. The newest, boldest tech is a new pressure-sensitive touchscreen technology called 3D Touch. There are lots of other improvements, too: better cameras. And always-on (and I mean always -on -- unless you turn it off) Siri. And, something I didn't even get a chance to test fully: a completely redesigned construction with a reinforced glass screen, which Apple promises is sturdier all-around. We'll get to that in the next few weeks, but that alone could make a difference for a lot of would-be buyers.. 3D Touch might be the "Next Big Idea" in touchscreens and interfaces. But does it make these new iPhones must-haves for that reason alone? I think it will, down the road, when more apps are here. But right now, its software advantages are subtle.. I spent a week with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus (in rose gold and gold, respectively), taking them everywhere I went, from farmer's markets in New Jersey to tailgating at a New York Jets game, to commuting on New Jersey Transit through the Meadowlands and to my kid's meet-the-teacher night. I showed them to my friends, my family, anyone I met and got their opinions, too. (For on-the-fly impressions, check out my weekend diary .). I might take the miracle of tiny, powerful smartphones for granted, but I can't shake the feeling that the iPhone 6S doesn't, at this moment, have the "one big thing" to make people want to upgrade from the 6. That doesn't mean it's not a better phone, of course it is. Right now, however, it's a promising upgrade from the iPhone 6, not a revolution.. But if you've been holding off on getting an iPhone for a while, don't wait anymore. Get this one (or its big-screen sibling, the 6S Plus). Just make sure you don't buy the 16GB model.. Press in on the iPhone 6S screen and new fascinating things happen. You feel a buzz, or a light click. Much like the Apple Watch , these iPhones let you push in on the screen to accomplish small tasks. And it's the boldest new tech on these iPhones by a mile.. It's a cool idea, but as I've discovered showing it to my family and friends, it's not entirely intuitive at first. Yes, its promises could be vast. But 3D Touch ends up being used very tentatively in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus software at the current moment: it mostly adds either pop-up "quick action" menus from apps on the home screen, or adds "peek" and "pop" to apps, expanding links or messages into previews that you can then open up fully, or tuck back away by lifting your finger. Some apps do a lot with these new ideas, especially Mail.. Peeking-and-filing emails can transform how that app is used. But a lot of people who try it for the first time don't realize how to take advantage of 3D Touch. And for the most part, 3D Touch isn't essential yet. Until it starts to be incorporated into more apps -- and in a more useful fashion -- I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people forget that it even exists.. I like using 3D Touch to preview links, or to pop-up related apps. When I hold an app and see a menu of extra options under my thumb, it feels almost like a computer, not a phone (the latest MacBooks , which utilize a similar but less sensor-studded trackpad technology Apple calls Force Touch, have pop-up previews in Safari , too). Apple's building a common language, and evolving what your phone-sized computer can do.. Pop-out previews are a really clever idea; links within Safari preview Web pages without any actual clicks. The ability to pull up menus in the iPhone almost feels like right-clicking on a computer and getting a contextual menu. But you don't need to use it, you can always do things the same old way as always, with regular touch controls. You can even turn 3D Touch off. And, those menus that pop up don't offer all the options I'd want. They're not all that customizable, either: what 3D Touch does, or doesn't, do is mostly up to app developers. A good handful of apps have emerged to take advantage of 3D Touch, but it's going to take a while before it feels widespread.. Maybe that's why 3D Touch doesn't feel essential yet in iOS. But the apps that are emerging to take advantage of it are slowly coming, and those could get really interesting. Remotes -- controlling a drone with 3D Touch toggles to gently control directions, for instance. You could press down to change brush strokes when painting (the new Notes app already allows this). You could press down harder on virtual piano keys (Smule's Magic Piano app added this function already). Racing games can get analog gas pedals (AG Racer added this, and it's one of the best demonstrations of 3D Touch). I could see it working as a virtual dimmer for smart home remotes.. I've started 3D touching every icon, every menu; I want 3D Touch in all my apps, everywhere. I want smarter 3D Touch menus, smarter extra features. It's legitimately better to have it than not have it, but I don't expect its killer apps to emerge for at least a couple of months. And iOS could use splashier ways of taking advantage of it, too, like that animated lock screen. What if I could push through folders, or push-to-magnify, dipping in and out of views?. It's not a really matter of whether 3D Touch is worth upgrading to now. You'll upgrade to it sooner or later. Your phone will eventually have it. Do you want it later, or now? Down the road this is going to enable major, major changes in how iPhones and iOS work. Right now, it's a subtle thing.. Most of my friends and family didn't necessarily care about the iPhone's new features. My wife is long overdue for an upgrade from the iPhone 4S, but she didn't care about 3D Touch. Or Live Photos, for that matter. She's considering buying an iPhone 6. My brother-in-law just wanted Live Photos to help him go back and pick better photos, like Burst Mode. My mom already has an iPhone 6, and other than needing more storage for her photos she didn't see anything new she needed, either. My kids thought Live Photos were cool, but didn't recognize the difference between those and videos (down the road, I think that'll be true for most people, and that's probably the point).. If I were to buy a new phone now and didn't get an iPhone 6, I'd buy this, easily. In 64GB or 128GB -- never a 16GB (those smaller sizes barely hold enough photos and videos to get by if you're the type of person who doesn't delete). If I had an iPhone 6, I'd wait until next year...or, find a way to sell my phone and trade up without it costing me quite so much.. I think Apple, and the whole phone industry, are trying to change the "Should I upgrade?" question bit by bit. They're trying to make it an "every year" thing, not an "every two years" or "Should I buy something new?" thing. Phone plans like AT&T Next, or Apple's own yearly plan, are almost like leases. You can trade in your old ride and seamlessly move to a new one.. The 6S fits that model well; it's enhanced and improved. Is it shockingly new or a vault forward? No...except for the concept of 3D Touch, which is brilliant hardware still in need of software which will make it truly shine. That software, from iOS itself and apps, will come, but maybe not right away. 3D Touch could build a new style of touchscreen app design, bleeding into iPads, the Apple Watch and maybe influencing the rest of the industry.

What’s new for this model is the addition of 3D Touch Control, giving its users more freedom to access their smartphone through different modes of pressing the device. And while its display may look the same, Apple says that the new 6S Plus has been upgraded with an aerospace-grade aluminum frame. The original A8 chip on the iPhone 6 Plus has also been traded in for a much faster 64-bit A9 processor paired with a 2GB of LPDDR4 RAM. And at long last, Apple has traded in the 8MP rear-facing camera for a 12MP sensor with 4K video recording and a 5MP front-facing camera. Upon unboxing, the phone runs the latest iOS 9..

The Final iPhone 6S Plus Review. iPhone users may have considered themselves previously vehemently against the oversize styles popular with Android users. Those iPhone users, then, might be a little shocked when they take in the iPhone 6S Plus.. It's still much smaller than many Androids, such as the mammoth Samsung Galaxy models. Still, by iPhone standards, this is a larger phone. For many, however, this is a welcome change. The iPhone 6S Plus had the sleekness and style of a classic iPhone, but without that tiny screen.. Ultimately, the long and short of the iPhone 6S Plus is that it's extremely similar to the iPhone 6S, but larger. However, upon a deep examination of this phone, there are many differences, some better and some worse.. Compared to the iPhone 6S, the phone is thicker and larger, with a three dimensional touch screen that is sure to impress users. The five and a half inch screen boasts a beautiful. Images and videos come across impossibly crisp and sharp.. Despite the larger size, the iPhone 6S Plus is still very light. Unlike some quite bulky Androids, you won't feel like you're talking into a computer monitor when you're using it as a phone. The iPhone 6S Plus functions beautifully as a tablet, but isn't so cumbersome as to be difficult to use for phone and voice function purposes.. However, those who never made the leap to the iPhone 6S and were using a much older model, such as the 5S, might find it too large. The ideal size for a Smartphone is a debate that could take up the entire internet, but the bottom line is that Apple was producing phones that were significantly smaller than the average. Although sleek and compact is the name of their game, it was inevitable that they would eventually produce a larger iPhone to satisfy the current technological zeitgeist.. Plus, what many an early iPhone 6S Plus review failed to acknowledge is that the roll-out of the iPhone 6S Plus is coming at a financially tenuous time for Apple. When the one-of-a-kind Apple Watch failed to reverse the company's falling stock, the next move was not to create another unique, "new" product. Rather, Apple is understandably creating products that are similar to the Android and Chrome devices that seem to be skyrocketing in popularity. One of the cooler aspects of the iPhone 6S Plus is its three dimensional touch function. That may sound like techie gibberish, but in plain terms, it means that the phone responds differently based on how hard you press on the screen.. Young and seasoned Smartphone users will undoubtedly find this feature cool, new and exciting. However, there is a strong possibility that older Smartphone users, or those who are new to the iPhone brand, may find it difficult to master this fairly bold new. On actual use, the iPhone 6S Plus. seems to be fairly easy to master. While you might erroneously press too lightly or firmly at first, muscle memory quickly kicks in, and you develop an intuitive feel that allows you to use the phone easily. The three dimensional touch screen ultimately allows you to execute some commands faster - that is, as soon as you get over the initial learning curve and get a sense of how to use it.. For many Smartphone users, their device is as much a photo-taking tool as it is a communications tool. Apple is generally considered the gold standard when it comes to professional-quality phone cameras that are capable of taking truly stunning photographs. For this reason, they essentially had no choice but to offer consumers even more improved photograph technology on the iPhone 6S Plus.. iPhone 6S Plus users may enjoy a. While new phones from Samsung and Sony are in fact offering higher MPs, the photos taken on the iPhone 6S Plus are not lacking in clarity. In fact, the iPhone 6S Plus takes sharp, crisp images that enlarge seamlessly. Viewing a photo on the iPhone 6S Plus screen might make users a bit giddy upon first glance, as the photos truly look stunningly clear and professional.. Users can also use the "Live Photo" function, where the iPhone 6S Plus records a split-second video before and after you take the picture. It's one of those archetypal Apple functions. It's extremely cool and creates a dreamy, ethereal finish, but only professional artists or web personalities would ever have any actual real need for it.. It would have been impressive if the iPhone 6S Plus had come with a drastically improved battery life, but making innovations to batteries has never quite been Apple's style. Battery life seems to be on par with the iPhone 6S. Users who are streaming a lot of web content or using a lot of memory-heavy apps will still see their batteries die in an amount of time that is laughably short, especially when compared to a lot of Android phones.. But you can't entirely blame Apple for its unimpressive battery life. With its A9 processing chip and its astonishingly clear graphics - not to mention the three dimensional touch screen - a better battery could have easily rendered the iPhone 6S Plus either completely unaffordable or prohibitively heavy. At the risk of sounding glib, when it comes to the battery life of the iPhone 6S Plus, Apple did their best.. The 2GB RAM of the iPhone 6S Plus is more than decent, allowing the phone to function at an excellent speed and ensure that the apps and features work swimmingly. In fact, compared to similar Smartphones on the market, the speed of the iPhone 6S Plus is lightning quick.. It might sound dramatic, but the future of the iPhone may very well depend on the success of the iPhone 6S Plus. As previously stated, this is a critical time for Apple, from a business and economic standpoint. Until now, Apple has done well because they have always been at the forefront of new technology and sleek design. Apple has always been, to put it simply, the trendiest kid in his class.. When the iPhone first launched, it was basically the only real competitor in the game. However, Android was a true dark horse. Even industry insiders never speculated that the Android would be a real competitor for Apple. However, the unexpected happened, and Android phones are without a doubt the true force to be reckoned with.. Hence, there is a lot riding on the iPhone 6S Plus. It has taken cues from more successful phones on the market, while still retaining the qualities that make it so distinctly Apple. The next decade is going to be a critical time for the Apple brand. As it stands now, they're not necessarily the coolest kid in their class anymore, but they're hardly the nerd in the corner, either.. There are some diehard iPhone fans that are going to upgrade to the iPhone 6S Plus without needing to be told. Others might hold off for a bit, waiting for the device to come down in price. What can absolutely be said is that this is a great phone for anyone who is interested in coming to the iPhone from an Android device. It's large enough to have the functionality of a tablet without being so big and heavy as to be cumbersome. This is a device that might be shocking to longtime iPhone users, but that will undoubtedly thrill those who dreamed of a larger model of the iPhone.. Bottom line, this is a good phone. It has great functionality, cool new features and the crystal clear resolution and beautiful playback that users expect from Apple products.. Get $100 off iPhone 7 or 7 Plus.

Software Pricing and competition Daily usage experiences and conclusion. The Apple iPhone "s" models keep the same form factor as the previous model while bumping up the internals. While the iPhone 6s Plus looks and feels like a 6 Plus, there are significant hardware changes making this the most compelling "s" model yet.. The pressure-sensitive display technology is new, higher strength aluminum used to reduce bending, both cameras have been upgraded, the A9 processor is up to 70 percent faster than the A8 model, the amount of RAM has been doubled, the Touch ID button is now lightning fast, you can connect with up to 23 LTE bands, and WiFi up to 866 Mbps is supported. These are just the hardware improvements, but even more is provided in the software.. Despite a display resolution matching last year's Android smartphones, the iPhone display looks fantastic with clear fonts, dark blacks, and good daylight visibility. A 1080p display is perfectly fine for a smartphone and for some reason Apple's looks as good as higher resolution Android devices to my eyes.. It's great to finally see RAM upgraded so that more can be done on the iPhone. It is very disappointing to still see Apple trying to peddle a measly 16GB model and I recommend everyone avoid it or you will likely be disappointed in a month or two when you reach your storage capacity.. The iPhone 6s Plus is slightly thicker, by 0.2 mm, but 20 grams heavier than the iPhone 6 Plus. You might think the weight gain is due to the higher strength 7000 series aluminum in the 6s Plus designed to keep the new big iPhone from bending to easily. The iPhone 6 Plus was constructed of 6000 series aluminum.. I understand the weight gain is primarily due to the 3D Touch technology that required a new display layer to sense and measure pressure. The new display is reportedly twice as heavy as the iPhone 6 display, which also adds to the overall thickness of the new iPhone 6s.. You will still find all the buttons, ports, and cameras in the same place. The rear camera still sticks out a bit from the back. The speaker is still mono, but remains one of the loudest, best sounding speakers I have used on a mobile device. The glass still rolls off the front and down through the edges, which gives it a great look and feel.. There are still large bezels above and below the display with side bezels being a bit wider than devices like the Galaxy Note 5. With the competition having larger displays in smaller form factors, I think this is one area Apple should improve upon in the iPhone 7.. My iPhone 6 Plus battery was awesome and I often wondered how a phone with less capacity than others could get through so much more of my day. The iPhone 6s Plus has a slightly smaller capacity battery, but so far I am getting the same great battery life I did with my 6 Plus. Apple seems better at optimizing battery conservation when the display is off as my Android devices lose battery capacity faster when not in active use. This is important in the way I use my phone in spurts of activity.. I am disappointed to see that Apple has not yet integrated rapid charging technology. This is one feature Apple has left on the table where devices like the Galaxy Note 5, LG G4, and even the low cost Moto X. I love being able to get a few more hours of use from a few minutes of charge or have the option to set my Note 5 down on a wireless charger without even looking for a cable.. The iPhone rear camera was bumped up from 8 megapixels to 12 megapixels, but I'm not seeing much difference here yet. That's OK since the iPhone 6 Plus camera was already one of the best around, but Android cameras from Samsung and LG have passed the iPhone in terms of overall capability. However, for the auto mode experience Apple still seems to beat the competition.. The front facing camera saw a significant upgrade from 1.2 megapixels to 5 megapixels. Even better, Apple now uses the display to enable a flash mode. The LG G4 does something similar, but the iPhone method works even better. I am amazed by the quality and accuracy of the colors and lighting provided by the display on the front facing camera.. Flash off on top and front-facing screen flash on the bottom. I already covered many of the unique features in iOS 9 and present on the iPhone 6s Plus, including 3D Touch (with Quick Action, Peek and Pop), Touch ID, Live Photos, and Hey Siri. I'm finding more ways to use 3D Touch within apps and love the efficiency.. While early on I didn't see the point of Live Photos, I now understand that the yellow indicator is activated before and after your capture so I am no longer capturing action as I put my iPhone down. My iPhone 6s Plus helped me capture some great moments of my youngest daughter's 16th birthday this weekend and Live Photos helped capture the context and fun around the photo that were taken. I hope we can eventually select a different moment before or after the current capture.. Thanks to the new embedded M9 motion coprocessor, activating Siri without having my iPhone 6s Plus plugged into a charger has been a joy over the past 10 days. I am constantly asking Siri what the latest sports scores are, using her to help create location-based reminders, find out what's next on my calendar, give me directions to locations, and much more.. The new Notes is a much more functional application that lets you easily include photos, sketches, web links, checklists, maps, and more. This was one application that hasn't been improved for years so its great to see some improvements.. Apple News has many more news sources than when I last tested the beta and I am enjoying browsing through the feeds created for me.. The iPhone 6s Plus is extremely responsive, Android still doesn't scroll as smoothly, all of the apps and services I want are there, and iOS 9 with WatchOS2 makes my Apple Watch more useful as well.. The Apple iPhone remains the most expensive smartphone line available today with 6s prices ranging from $649 to $849 and the 6s Plus ranging from $749 to $949. Thankfully, the resale value for the iPhone line remains very high so you should be able to go a year using one and only lose $200 to $300 in value.. Again, I can't recommend anyone purchase the 16GB model, especially after having older relatives buy the 16GB model and then need me to help clear the devices so they could continue using them to take photos. With today's use of the iPhone as the primary camera and advanced capabilities, 16GB is just not acceptable for anyone.. You can purchase the iPhone 6s/6s Plus outright like I did, via carrier financing options (T-Mobile even has an option that discounts the iPhone), or through Apple's new iPhone Upgrade Program. While Apple is actively promoting the iPhone Upgrade Program, look a bit closer at the real costs and understand you are required to buy the AppleCare+ protection plan that will end up costing you more to replace a broken display than it would if you did not have coverage and just took it to Apple to replace your display. I imagine Apple will make huge profits from this program, which is the point of the offering it in the first place. Did you really think Apple launched the program for your benefit?. The competition for the new iPhone 6s/6s Plus includes the Samsung Galaxy S6 line, the LG G4, and the Sony Xperia Z5. HTC may soon launch a viable competitor if they improve the camera performance.. The Apple iPhone 6s Plus is a significant upgrade from the 6 Plus, but the competition also continues to push forward. The iPhone 6s Plus camera may not be the best complete camera available today, but it continues to shine in auto mode, which is what most people care about and use. The Samsung Galaxy Note 5/S6 line and the LG G4 has more functionality, including RAW support and manual mode. Check out my latest Flickr album with shots from the Galaxy Note 5, iPhone 6s Plus, and ZUK Z1.. The iPhone 6s Plus is the best iPhone you can buy today and iOS users won't be disappointed. It's a bit large compared to competing devices with the same, or larger, displays, but the 6s Plus does support landscape orientation so it can also serve as a miniature tablet. There is a vast number of apps and services, with some still launching on iOS before Android.. I've been able to go through full long days with my iPhone 6s Plus over each of the past ten days, but would still greatly appreciate rapid charging in a future iPhone. With my three daughters using iMessage and FaceTime, the iPhone 6s Plus may once again be my daily driver for the next few months. Enjoying the heck out of my Apple Watch , while the Android Wear experience on iOS is too limited, means an iPhone is likely to stick around for the long term.. The iPhone 6s Plus has some amazing improvements, but it's tough to recommend people pay $650+ to upgrade if they already have an iPhone 6. If you can sell your existing phone and only lose out on a couple hundred, then I think you will enjoy all of the new technology and improvements in the new iPhone 6s Plus.. If not, then you can look at your friend's iPhone 6s Plus and know that the iPhone 7 will likely have all of that technology in more in a year.. Kick off your day with ZDNet's daily email newsletter.

Yes, I agree the camera has been a disappointment after having best cameras by Samsung and Sony. I am sure the team at apple will get this better with iPhone 7 this year. I have also came across this platform called www.fanreviews.co where lot of areas of Apple iPhone 6 & 6s https://fanreviews.co/mobiles/apple-iphone-6s-plus-2015-user-video-reviews are covered may be this is useful for others here. I'm new to phone photography; with nearly fifty years of L, M & 35mm shooting, developing and printing photos... I'm wondering why are yawl bickering over which is the best or saying yours is better. First it's the lens that matters, second it's the lighting, lastly but not the lest, is the photographer's skill. In some cases it's their luck. You take photos? You are my friend. I've traveled the world and every photographer wants to talk about light. Rarely about equipment, we use what we have. Give me a box with a pin hole. The main reason why I'd opt for the 6s Plus would be the optical image stabilizer, which, in my opinion, is worth all the money.. Still, there's one thing bugging me: video quality. For example, on this blog, http://www.ios8downloadbetas.com/does-the-iphone-6s-plus-have-the-best-camera/ , it says that the Xperia Z5 is able to shoot better 4K videos. Honestly, I find this hard to believe. Anybody who can make things clear? Thanks!. Honestly 4K video is a feature I’ll not use for a while–at least until 4K televisions come down in price. Unless you have a TV capable of 4K, what’s the point in recording in 4K? Also note, that recording in 4K takes up a TON of space–3 minutes of 4K video takes up 1GB of space!. Yuu can see detailed review on the device over here https://fanreviews.co/mobiles/apple-iphone-6s-plus-2015-user-video-reviews. glad I opted for the $300 5s on black friday instead of upgrading to the 6s. with only 8mp produces decent TIFFs using iRaw.. just cannot get over horrid processing Apple is using on 6s and 6s Plus, gone is that 'natural looking' photo mantra, just take a portrait and look at the skin at 100%... horrid waxy looking, much (much) worse than other current smartphones, what was (is) Apple thinking?? the photos look so processed (like the Xperia's of 2 years ago). see what I mean here http://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3933323 and here http://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3936194. To whom much is given, much is expected. Things should be way better at this point for the price iPhones are selling for. It really bothers me that Apple hasn't: 1. apparently they have 800 people working on the Camera as per the latest "60 Min" CBS interview !. "apparently they have 800 people working on the Camera as per the latest "60 Min" CBS interview !". It, for example, would have take them some dozens of manhours only to fine-tune the noise reduction parameters when shooting stills / panos at base / low ISO, as has been proved by my findings I've linked to below. (They may have thought their costumers are all non-techies not bothered by the messed-up, awful shadow regions even in well-lit shots? Prolly.). Also, a LOT device manufacturers (MS, Samsung, LG, Pana or, in the past, Nokia etc.) with a LOT less resources allocated to cameras have produced significantly better fine-tuned and much more capable cameras. Compare for example the images the new Lumia 950 (XL) produce - or, for that matter, even the comparatively cheap LG G4. And yes, in addition to being much better fine-tuned, they all offer RAW as well - and not only via third-party apps (via the API).. yes NR is horrific, even at low iso's... really disappointed in the 6s' camera!. you'll really want to check out my posts (and comparative images) at http://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/56919409. I've managed to significantly increase the panorama shooting quality by dialing down noise reduction!. This will only work on jailbroken devices. On non-JB'n ones, you simply can't have any way of getting rid of the excessive and, in many cases (e.g., shooting at or slightly above base ISO) absolutely unnecessary default noise reduction.. Again, so far, I only managed to improve the sweep pano mode. However, I'm absolutely confident I'll be able to improve still image quality as well, as soon as I find out how Apple configures its noise reduction.. Apple likes their pictures with a little bit of warmth filter and a boost in the shadows. Kinda like a mild instagram for all their pictures out of their camera. Not really accurate so it'll always underperform according to accuracy. You talk to people out in the wild, they'll always say "I don't know what it is but iPhone always takes so much better pictures" because they judge based on emotion, not technical accuracy. The Galaxy S6 and Note5 (S6 with RAW/DNG output) is more of a best available camera on a smartphone to bridge the gap between cameras and smartphones, while Apple is just trying to produce a better jpeg files for mobile use. Agree, but Apple dropped the ball here. The image quality should be better.. "Agree, but Apple dropped the ball here. The image quality should be better.". As I've proved in my (jailbroken, low-level hardware) tests(*), the hardware would be capable of much better results. It's just Apple that applies far too much (unnecessary) shadow noise reduction even at base ISO, when it would in no way be necessary.. *: please see my posts, fully packed with examples, at http://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/56919409. "while Apple is just trying to produce a better jpeg files for mobile use. - did implement RAW support, at least on the API level (for third-party apps) - they still haven't bothered. - spent a little more time on configuring the strength and selective (local brightness-dependent) noise reduction algorithm. As proved by my sweep pano examples, they apply very strong-handed noise reduction in the shadows even at very low ISO's, which would be absolutely unnecessary, as there is very little color noise even at ISO64, let alone lower ISO values. Nevertheless, even at ISO64, shadow areas are completely messed up by Apple's NR.. Why is it becoming so much more difficult to find a list of scores for these phones? I don't care who is threatening to sue, it should be up front on the main page here and on dxo. That's what people come here to see.. Phones as cameras reminds me of what happened with popular music in the last 15 years. It went from catering to every different taste to primarily catering to pre-teen girls and 20-somethings who frequent Starbucks.. Phones are the "autotuned" of the camera world.. Did you guys ever give the Panasonic cm1 a rating?. you'll really want to check out my latest post (and comparative images) at http://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/56961343 - I've managed to significantly increase the panorama shooting quality by dialing down noise reduction!. Again, this will only work on jailbroken devices. On non-JB'n ones, you simply can't have any way of getting rid of the excessive noise reduction.. I've just posted another pair of panos comparing the output of my version to that of Apple:. Iphone 6s plus is the awesome phone with the perfect price range best than all other iPhones in all the categories. definitely not in terms of camera or IQ!!!. i also want to have it.. Can you suggest a suitable tripod mount to hold such a large phone upright to obtaon the best results as here in the UK we seem to lack such a vitally necessary device. Even a motorozed version with variable speeds for different light levels would be great. I Have very steady hands still and can track accurately according to the guidelines but maontaoning an unvarying speed gets very difficult indeed as you turn a full circle and usually on ground and two feet that are neither level nor able to maintaon a constant axis.. Also what cameras still have holes provoded for wriststraps as I cannot find and so hang onto my old N8 Nokia from 2010 when they all mostly had wristraps.. For the built-in sweep pano, you won't really need a tripod. Generally, only the closest edges (or late very low-constrast ones) etc. Of course, it won't make things worse.. If, on the other hand, you plan on shooting stills for future pano stitching (in third-party apps), you'll definitely need a dedicated pano head. While I haven't tried it myself*, I'm pretty sure it's possible to put an iPhone 6s+ on most pano heads (Nodal series etc).. *: I wouldn't bother with doing any serious work with the iPhone, particularly not panoramas. Even a (now), compared to the 6s+, very cheap (about one-third the price if you buy it second-hand) Fuji X-E1+ 27mm combo, assuming the same (decent) tripod and pano head (e.g., Nodal Ninja 3) produces orders of magnitude better images, and particularly better final panos. If you already plan to take a (largeish) tripod with you, get a decent system camera with you for shooting, not the iPhone.. Stitched (not automatic sweep a'la iPhone) panoramas, when properly shot, require as much dynamic range and lack of noise as possible as you'll need to shoot with locked exposure (and, of course, focus). The iPhone6s+ is simply incapable of the DR (and noise) of any decent large-sensor camera.. I've published a lot of info on all these (with the X-E1), feel free to read my writeup at http://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3896092. Note that I also link to my articles discussing my iPhone6s+ sweep pano improvements (jailbreak only).. Well, when all is said and done one can hardly expect the camera of an iPhone or any other mobile device to compare to that of a DSLR. I do however find it nothing short of hilarious how camera manufacturers continue to profess how astounding their cameras are with the hopes of improving market sales.. Cell Phone manufacturers are doing a way better job than DSLR makers are these days!. I must admit that for what most people post to now, ergo, web based stuff, why have a real camera anymore?. I have a Samsung Note 4 and I myself am darn impressed how "easy" it is to get a nice looking shot in a heartbeat. Am I going to print it at 8x10 no, but am I going to send some to my relation, friends Yes.. Well, considering the fact that "TRUE" photographers like myself and many others require much more than just "nice" photographs, using a mobile phone as a primary tool for taking photos is not an option. Then again photography (which in itself is an art) is not just for anyone.. Well I own a Sony A7r with a lot of toys to go along with it, but that does not take away the ability of my Note 4, which I have 24/7 with me, to take a picture that works versus even yes, lugging a 10 pound Tripod, which by the way you need with a A7r, and a bag full of nice lenses, etc., for a day out in the woods per say. Not counting other cameras I own.. We are the few that exist anymore on here that really could care about great photos to print or Pixel Peep, which even most of us do, even me. I probably only print large 1 in 1,000 shoots I take and I doubt that. It is big bucks to print big.. I treat my A7r more like a view camera than just a handheld camera. Without OOS in camera it is VERY unforgiving.. Versus the Note 4 where it just seems to work with Oly like colors in the blink of a eye pulled out of my pocket. I don't see how anyone can knock it for what it is intended to do. Am I going to print a 16x20 with it no. Am I going to post it to Facebook or Flicker, yes I am.. Photography is an ART and NOT just about sharing "nice" pictures on FB or Flicker. There are photographers and then there are just who like to fool themselves into thinking themselves photographers.. Me thinks you are full of it. Art is in the eye of the beholder.. A snapshot of a baby with a iphone is Art to a young mother and her child.. I bet you, like me, and many others on DPR have EVER been lucky enough to have taken 100 Killer pictures in their life that they would hang in a ART exposition.. And I have been doing this a Long time. Oh, and by the way I really am in the camp that Photography is really not an ART. It is too easy, for way to many people, to luck out and take a great shot to call it a ART like you seem to think.. Artist are few and far between to be lumped into a "craft" I will call it. And I made a full time living as a Photographer for 17 years. I won't even call Ansel Adams a Artist. He was a VERY special Craftsman in his field. Well to each his/her own poison. That's what makes us all unique. :) Thanks for the replies and if I seem full of it please accept my most sincere apology. I guess my passion for photography makes me emotional especially whenever mobile phones are concerned.. I am Glad you have a passion for it. That is what makes you better!. If you are good you can take a Great picture with a Cell Phone. Strive to do better and hone your "craft"/ ART.. Good luck with your photography, it is a wonderful Hobby, even can lead to a rewarding Business. Memories that will last your lifetime. It was a pleasure meeting you. I will admit our short conversation has given me a new outlook on mobile photography. I wish you the best in your photography and would love to pick your brain occasionally if I need any advice on how to improve my pictures.. The only way to improve it. You can read every book on the web, but you have to get out and put it to use.. Learn everything about your camera and how the lenses you have work in different situations. Night time, daytime, wide open, fully closed. It makes a huge difference mood wise. It can be fun to experiment. Screw up, no big deal delete it. Most cell phones you are not going to print much of anything. It is for social Media mostly. Now Video that is another story. I have made some darn interesting Videos with my Samsung Note 4 using 4k video on it. Downsized to HD, well it is excellent. Even my Apple 5s in HD is good. It is the future down the road with frame grabs. 4k has 8mp frame grabs, 8k will have 32mp frame grabs. It is out in Japan already.. Davinci Resolve 12 is out now for free. Get it!! Learn Video, it is the future. Complex and scary at first, but very logical once you learn to use it.. I use a lot of old 40's, 50's Blues Songs on my Videos. Free music, and sets a killer mood on certain Videos.. Get on Vimeo and watch a lot of the short films on there. Some amazing stuff with Cell Phones and not so expensive cameras. Skill has no boundaries over cost LoL.. I've got both (technically my gf has the 6s Plus) and feel the Note 5 is superior in every way. Even the grip is more comfortable and you won't miss as many shots with the quick launch feature. Detail is much sharper than the 6s Plus and image stabilization is much smoother. Even 9to5 Mac wrote a review where the Note 5 crushed the 6s Plus in almost every category. Hands down the Note 5 will make you fall in love with cellphone photography.. Is the OIS in the Note5 significantly better than the Note4? I've done a lot of Note4 vs. iPhone6s+ comparisons and, generally, I've found the OIS of the 6s+ better.. You must have some alignment problems. Galaxy note 4 is sharper on the right, iphone is sharper on the left. So the "better phone" depends on where you look.. Iphone is way too yellow and without measuring, a couple of units too red.. Iphone isn't "warm" on this calibrated monitor, it is merely jaundiced ant the people shots confirm that impression.. The grey is not grey at all, it's terrible.. Just posted a new thread here in the iOS subforum, shot on the 6s+:. "This is what you can expect of Camera+'s / 645 Pro's TIFF files (comparison!)". I have one, and is enough for me.. Horrible camera quality from iPhone 6s, worst than old iPhone 6. The way better (economical) alternative, *if* one doesn't need an Apple Logo as Status symbol: Xiaomi RedMi Note 3:. Metal body CPU: 64bit MT6795 Helio X10 Octa Core 2.0GHz, GPU: PowerVR G6200 700MHz 5.5 inch FHD 1920 x 1080 pixels IPS capacitive touch screen MIUI V7; 3 GB RAM + 32 GB ROM. 5.0MP front camera, 13.0MP back camera with flashlight and auto focus. Networking: 2G GSM: 900/1800/1900MHz; 3G WCDMA: 850/900/1900/2100MHz 4G FDD-LTE: 1800/2100/2600MHz, TDD-LTE (B38/B39/B40/B41: 2555-2655MHz). 3 GB vs 2GB RAM, fast Helio X10 MediaTek CPU, good 13 MP cam with Phase Detect AF, huge 4050mA battery, way cheaper than this 6s i.Phone, and way stylish, too. Fingerprint sensor included, also 5.5" FHD Display.. Looks quite good to me, would be my new smartphone in 2016 later. It looks like a excellent 6s Alternative, but not for stupid premium, apple asks for. While I'm in no way an Apple fanboy (some people here at Connect even think I'm an Apple hater - see for example my previous comments on the low quality of third-party pre-iPad Pro pen solutions), I much prefer using my 6s+ to my Note4 (both flagships) in everyday life, particularly for Web browsing. It's just snappier and more productive (except for niceties like pen, NFC quick transfer/control initiating or IR remote control, naturally).. To be honest, after having tested the Redmi Note 2, which, at least on paper, has the same camera as the Note 3, I would not recommend it for photography. Or at least I would recommend trying before buying ;). I wouldn't recommand a smartphone for daily-based photography, to be honest...it's way too much a compromise, only the DMC CM1 does have a decent 1" sensor, but the 28mm "Leica" lens is also by no means perfect...so either a small system camera or something like the RX100 series or another premium compact would do the trick.. 3G RAM with 32G storage only 1099 yuan? That's only USD$ 170 WOW! Another USD$ premium gets you an Apple logo, Apple ecosystem, and maybe slightly better photo image? What's the camera and sensor size of the Xiaomi? Any phase detection?. Guys, if you have a JB'n device, you're saved: it seems I've managed to reduce noise reduction. I'm still ding a lot of tests and fine tuning but the first results are more than promising.. Let me know if you need more info on this prompttly (most importantly, the changed CameraSetup.plist) before I publish a full tutorial and prolly a full Cydia configurer app (like my past camera enhancers) later.. Continouusly posting my findings to http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tweaking-camerasetup-plist-to-disable-the-agressive-iphone6-noise-filter.1928340/#post-22328064. Have just released an Xcode project (full source code) to greatly ease hacking and testing - see the above post at MR.. Thanks! Just posted a major update (see second post):. I've just posted another pair of panos comparing the output of my version to that of Apple:. I am astonished that after singling out the panorama mode for praise as the best currently available, I could find no examples. Can I have missed them? Is there some special area where such examples are stored?. It is indeed somewhat better than, say, Samung's implementation. I've very thoroughly compared the two and the iPhone has always delivered somewhat better results.. there is a whole bunch of panorama samples in the features section of the review.. Upgraded recently and have to say in most ways the camera is a disappointment. The new pixel technology was supposed to provide at least a bit better quality images, but these match what mine look like... at 100% full size they have a distinct "digital mush" look to them.. The dynamic range is indeed great - as is that panorama mode. But detail capture is for an $849 phone (64 gig), pathetically bad.. Not the biggest Apple fanboy, but I do have to say I'm quite pleased with the new camera.. Pic #3 an update to 1984.. Come on guys, AGAIN sensor size is not in the "Key Photographic / Video Specifications" list.. There really are just two things that specify the upper limit of the performance of a digital imaging system: aperture and sensor size. All the marketing terms: BSI, MP, CMOS vs CCD (and all the BS without I), etc, come after that. Marketing blah-blah-jargon agains real, tangible numbers.. I refuse to believe that you, who are pretty much the definitive guys regarding digital photography, don't know this. So please explain why, WHY do you not think sensor size is something that should be presented just along with maximum aperture. I fully agree with Henrik, and to state this here, I got a new pasword for this website since I had forgotten the other one for several years As a professional photographer there's really one thing that I like to know first when evalutating a new camera: the sensor size. Without that information further details for me are - excuse my words - useless and I think I'm not the only one here. Like Henkik, I would like to know WHY sensor size should be something of a secret. For everything else this is a great website and I don't deny that camera's with small sensors make great pictures.. Nevertheless, if you Google around, you can easily find all iPhones have 1/3" sensors starting with the 5s. The 5 had a smaller 1/3.2" one.. Incidentally, it's Apple that also indirectly tells us the sensor size. Remember the 5 -> 5s switch? One of their main announcement bullets was the increased sensor size. That is, if any newer iPhone model would have had a larger sensor size, Apple would have announced it.. Of course they (as with Samsung and Sony, who, in their ads, always emphasize the substantially larger sensor sizes in their flagships) also know larger sensor means better IQ.. Can't defy physics with software alone.. I don't care if they take pictures like a Nikon 810.. I can't believe how bad the images are. I was really hoping for something better this time around but I guess there are better options these days that produce much better images. I have tried almost everything and it looks like devices that are a few years old (like the Nokia 1020) or at least 1 year old (like the Panasonic CM 1) are still leaps and bounds above the image quality of the iPhone. The iPhone 6 is better than this. For low light people shots (which most cell phones are used for) you really need the Xenon flash. More companies should be incorporating it. I guess Apple gets by on how well the rest of the phone performs and the fact that most people don't care too much about the quality of their images.. I had the same issue and was ready to condemn the new phone as a piece of junk. Go into your settings and then camera. Change your settings to 4K and the higher resolutions. My opinion has changed, this is a fantastic little camera.. well my pics look fine on my Mac. there must be something wrong with your eyes..... Where do you see bad images? Maybe you need glasses.. I can't believe how bad the whole thing is.. It's like 2012 and 13 etc have just passed them by.. Why don't they just give up? Dismantle the company and give the money back to the shareholders.. I picked up a 6S a few weeks ago because my 5 was damaged and non-functional.. At first, I was thinking I should sell my Canon S110 pocket camera as this would replace it.. Having compared shots side by side, they are worlds apart. The phone is great for video and quick snapshots to share, but even the little sensor on the S110 offers a great deal more detail and image quality than the phone. We've still got a few years to go before the mainstream cell phones truly overtake pocketable midrange cameras.. Agreed, I have Canon DSLR's that can do spectacularly amazing things that can only be done with that level of equipment. The problem is that the professional photographic gear is bulky and it doesn't go everywhere you take your phone. Phone cameras are improving with every upgrade but I do not think that it would be fair to expect a $1000 phone to do the same as a proper camera.. I hope you'll do a review of the camera on the new Microsoft Lumina 950. Great specs, and my initial impression is very good. Would be interesting to see how it compares to others.. so reading the comments below, seeing same ppl repeating hate comments. the conclusion is, apple is still king. I guess they didnt need to upgrade the camera, ios camera is the king of mobile photography, its intuitiveness, ease of use and the amazing-get-it-right is something android been trying very hard with no success so far.. King in the crappy world LOL.. When the Galaxy note 4 came out LAST year, apple certainly was NOT king, it was the also ran. Even now (with a 16 month OLD Note 4 as a comparison) it is too close reliably call.. A review of the note FIVE which was released BEFORE the iphone 6s+ would make a more interesting (and relevant) battle.. Also note the left/right alignment issues I saw between iphone and the Note 4 images above. Look at the left AND right edges. They BOTH seemed out of alignment during shooting.. I'm still amazed at how poor the IQ of the 6S is, I got mine and am very disappointed with the results, see thread here http://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3933323 it was always the 'other brands' with too much processing and smearing etc... 'And you can view Live Photos on your other Apple devices, too.'. Isn't there a law against the trade of live photos, or something?. NOOOO!!! I JUST ordered a 128gb iPhone 6s Plus, DAMN YOU APPLE!!! I should have just got a Panasonic CM1, they're $500 right now at BH Photo Video. I notice an improvement between the 6 and 6s and if you use a camera app, you will get better pictures than from the native stock app because you will be able to change all the camera settings prior to taking the shot. I use a camera app for 99% of all my shots and shoot in 16:9 rather than what Apple provides, which is a boxy picture. Only when the subject has a lot of height, do I use the in-camera app.. What apps do you recommend? I've been away from Apple since my 4s.... Apple has a 2 week money back policy if you don't want it. I initially bought the 6s (which I used for 2 weeks) but I changed it because the 6s Plus has image stabilization. After learning where to change the camera settings, I can now benefit from the 4K video which even works well in quite low light. This is a fantastic piece of equipment.. I hate the photos that the iPhone 6s Plus produces so much, I am considering going back to the original 6 plus. So much better IQ in every way.. yes I just upgraded to 6S from 6 and detail is horrid, see this thread I put up today, I'm quite shocked actually http://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3933323. there are no settings to adjust (only live photo which is off). Current 6s+ users, if you've jailbroken or can JB, you can join the discussion of hacking the camera plist file. CNR has already been eliminated and I do think I'll soon find the way to eliminate LNR too.. Just another example of Apple dropping the ball lately. Its a similar story elsewhere with their services, apps etc...they seem to have become a victim of their own success...sad.. And sadly just another silly Apple is doomed shouter.. NO actually they (Apple) have lost the plot a bit, the IQ from the 6s is just poor, waxy water color effect on ALL skin tones and detail in general.. So, even the avid Apple fans are unhappy.... This certainly looks like step back. The noise reduction algorithm is just so awful, I can't stand it. The "paint by numbers" effect is pronounced even in good light and gets worse with the light level. This is most noticeable in skin (faces). And this is really difficult and time-consuming to fix in post-production.. What's sad is I actually like the photos I took with my old iPhone 4S better than those I take with my 6S Plus. The saturation, color accuracy, and detail were worse, but at least it had a much more natural noise (grain instead of smearing) and skin tones looked so much nicer.. I really wish Apple would let us turn off or dial back the noise reduction, but I doubt that's ever going to happen.. yip I'm amazed at how bad detail smearing is on the 6S see here http://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3933323. That is no better than ISO-766 of Nexus 5X =D. no better, actually a bit worse.. The pro (manual) mode in that lets you shoot in RAW is really top notch and worth a look. And considering Lightroom is available for Android, the world is your oyster. Of course, people who have the experience and understanding to reap the benefits of raw will benefit more than others.. Wow, Motorola MOTO X Style (Pure?) steps all over this. I'm curious as to where the phone camera rankings went. Even though I'm getting a 6S Plus, it's kinda fishy to me that the ranking is gone now that the iPhone isn't at the top. Or maybe I just don't know where it is :X. The 6S has an 82 vs 87 for the top ranked Sony Xperia Z5: http://www.dxomark.com/Mobiles/Announcing-a-new-display-order-for-DxOMark-Mobile-scores. I have the 6.44" Sony Xperia Z Ultra and sometimes use it with the Sony QX1 20mp APS-C E mount smartphone camera since I have many E and FE mount lenses along with adapters for my DSLR lenses. Yeah the information is there if you're willing to dive into each phone's review. But there used to be a table on the right side of the home page that would have the rankings easily visible, usually with the iPhones on top. With the iPhones being outclassed nowadays, that easy-to-see table is gone. Pathetic IQ, paying $700 bucks for a smartphone with mediocre features and results like this is laughable. $300 Nexus 5X is much better than this.. Google wrong footed the competition with the cameras on its new phones. Factor in ten price, and new Nexus models are just a little bit competitive.. Nexus 5X and 6P are much better in price/performance than any iPhone offering. Even the crappy 5C and 6C.. It probably has the best IQ in a smartphone in good light right now. I wonder what is lost though without the OIS as I find its value in low light with HDR mode in the Nexus 5.. Nexus phones are on par with Samsung S6/Note. Panasonic CM1 is still the king, Pureview 808 next.. Wit regard to IS, seriously, you don't need it for wide shots even on shutter speed of about a sec or two. I don't know why they are making big deal about it.. yip agreed, completely stunned by the poor IQ of my new 6S... Apple have lost the plot it seems!. @Mister Roboto: "Wit regard to IS, seriously, you don't need it for wide shots even on shutter speed of about a sec or two. I'm a hardcore smartphone shooter, having shot tens of thousands of shots with the 808 and some thousands with the Samsung Note 4 and the iPhone 6s Plus.. The 808 becomes increasingly unreliable under 1/30s. Very rare handheld shots are completely unblurred. The Note4, and particularly the 6s+, is ways better in this respect. Very rarely have I got camera shake-blurred photos with the 6s+.. That is, even with the 808 producing significantly better images WRT sharpness / artifacts than the 6s+, in low light, the iPhone is simply much better if you need to shoot handheld. There's simply no comparison - the 6s+ will always be better. (Albeit, of course, you do have the chance to have a sharp 808 shot out of, say, ten.). BTW, speaking of the Note4 vs. 6s+ comparison, the latter has definitely better IS in 4k mode. (I've made very thorough, synchronized tests.). I just tried my Nexus 5x at less than 1/30s like 5 times just a minute ago and it flawlessly shot a low-light scene without a blur. OIS is pretty much useless for smartphone.. big noise issues at iso 100 :-(. What are you looking at? The competition?. Mister Robot and DAPAL, My remark was aimed, directed and sent to Mr. Lars Rehm, the author of what I think is a top quality report with great images to illustrate his article. I wasn't talking to you or ANY other mouth that roams this page. Didn't both your moms teach you not to interrupt the adult's conversation if not being called? Instead of vomiting ludicrous opinions, try, just for the sake of argument, to write, illustrate and REDACT an article such as this one. Yes, I know you'll rant and write back, but I won't answer to any of you. I was told, long time ago to let the a..h.... Thanks for calling out the usual "clever" trolls around here.. @papa natas You weren't talking to anyone else here? On this public forum. Forgive anyone that dares reply to your comments. You clearly have anger issues, and are a rabid Apple "enthusiast". Your words above are what strengthens the negative stereotypes of that brand.. And about what our parents taught us? That was a long time ago. But by your immature reply, I'm guessing you're still living with yours.. That's what the world needs...An amateur shrink... Anger issues,,,Me? No..!! I only hate people who don't think like me, because my friends are all intelligent: they think like me. And I'm one of the few gifted high IQ you'll find here. And believe me...Didn't your mom teach you not to use academic expressions that you have no idea about? You saw your shadow? Now, go back to your hole!!. The file export comment is misleading as you can always email the "actual size" photos. Also, you can just install the Apple Mobile Device drivers (on a Windows PC) to access the device through Windows Explorer. I believe Windows Update will install the drivers for you.. In my opinion, only 3 or 4 of the negative points mentioned are real issues. Yes, the camera app should have extended features but you can't judge the device based upon something it "should" have. Review it for what it is... Is there a similar software as Airdroid in iOS world? It's so easy and fast to transfer files between Android devices and personal computers (PC or Mac) by WiFi. USB cable is not required anymore.. I also wondered if file export wouldn't go through Dropbox as well?. Of course one wouldn't want to see iTunes on one's Windows PC. Then, rather leave the snaps just in the phone.. But i do remember, when i (normally on Android devices) had to use an iPad temporarily, i was shocked at how difficult it is to actually get to your files and move them somewhere else. When i managed to (don't remember how, but through iTunes), i felt like i acted against the system and better hide.. I would think Dropbox might work. I'll have to give it a shot. I just never bothered to download the iOS app -- only use it for PC.. of course there's all sorts of hacks to get your files off the device, but you can't just plus in the cable and download them to your computer or laptop the old-fashioned but quick way. This requires iTunes to start, at least on the Windows Laptops I own.. I don't know why Airdrop wasn't mentioned as an option for easily and quickly moving files between devices. Next to each photo is a button which says Share. Click on it and the first option is Airdrop. Perhaps the reviewer doesn't know his way around iOS so well? alternatively the share button offers several other options including iCloud Photo Sharing.. BTW if you want to share between iOS devices or any platform there is the free app Instashare.. If the reviewer doesn't know their way around iOS then they should not be doing a review. Dropbox has an app, Carousel, Google has the Google Photos app and then there is Mylio. All of them will sync photos from iOS to a Windows PC.. ok, you've won, I have added "via USB" to that particular Con, just so you can stop listing all those apps you can use to transfer files...most of which are only an option if you have a really fast data connection and/or a lot of time. When I need to transfer lots of images I personally still find a USB cable the best way.. Shareit app works brilliantly across iOS Android and PC, and is over a hundred times faster than transferring via wifi. I was amazed at how easily and efficiently it works.. How come the app Image Capture on OSX will allow you to simply copy your pics and videos to your MAC but not on the PC? THere is no generic app on the PC that will allow this? Image Capture is not iPhone specific.. Really wasn't trying to bust your balls. I heartily agree that an opened and unlocked USB is the most practical option, especially for 4K video files. Due to the closed-system design of Apple's operating system, I presume there are security concerns with freely unlocking the USB port.. Glad to know there is a similar software to AirDroid for Android devices, great.. You can also use AirDrop to transfer between iOS devices and your Mac. I just don't think Lars knows much about iOS.. well, all I know is I need to have iTunes installed and running on my computer to make files visible on the internal memory of the phone when it's connected via USB cable. That's all I need to know to put it down as a Con. You go ahead and transfer these 4K video files via AirDrop ;). All I know is that I plugged my iPhone 6 into my Win 7 work laptop, opened up file explorer, navigated to the camera roll, and copied files via USB. iTunes is installed but not running.. point is you should not have to install a software to make a file transfer. If you don't have a problem with it just ignore that Con. The same is true for any other Pros and Cons in that Conclusion. Something that is a negative for one person might not be for the next. Still, it's arguably good to be aware of it :). I just uninstalled iTunes and Quicktime and it works the same. Nothing wrong with listing it as a con, provided you actually know how things work.. You said you needed to have iTunes running to make the file transfer, and that is simply not true.. Perhaps someone on DPR, who is familiar with iOS on Mac and PC, can look over your review for other inaccuracies. I don't know much about Android so i would never try review an Android phone by myself.. The fact that you can email a photo doesn't negate how USB cable transfer is. You can share Using: iMessage, mail, iCloud photo sharing, Notes, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, PDF, Dropbox, copy to, etc. Once you've saved the image, you can also put it in Box, or other services.. What's misleading is saying that you have to have iTunes running to transfer a file over USB.. so, given this point has generated some discussion here I thought it merited some more testing and I have come to the conclusion that yes, you can transfer images without iTunes. You need to unlock the phone and explicitly give permission for the PC to access the iPhone (which you don't have to do on Windows Phone or Android) but then you get access to your images (but not any other folders). So apologies, you were right and I was wrong. I have of course taken that line out of the conclusion.. PS: Instashare app is NOT free, hasn't been for quite a long time.. Shareit app is free and works like a charm.. Itunes suck big times.That was the main reason I hated Iphone.Everything needed to go through that...this means no movies or music for me to watch. Apple is pathetic with their protectiveness of DRM and their software and their Apple store.. File transfer is a NON-ISSUE: **Photo Transfer App** allows simple drag and drop two-way transfers between iOS devices and Win or MacOS devices once on the same network or after connected via Bluetooth. phototransferapp.com or on Apple App Store or GooglePlay. Have used happily it for years.. When review Samsung S6/S6 Edge and Note 5 as they share the same camera and lens?. we have already reviewed the S6/S6 Edge, check the review section.. Lars, oh, I found it, thx. But then why S6/Edge is not in your list of cellphone studio Scene?. yeah, we're looking to add that one sometime soon. I am doing the smartphone reviews in Europe but our studio scene is located at DPR headquarters in the US, so sometimes we are a little out of sync :). And much appreciating your photos from there. Besides the charm and interest, they bring back another life, or the kind of companionable mix I think we are headed for -- not least on DPReview. Thanks, Lars, and think you hit the target on judgment. Oh, and Apple's intention of convenience as far as photo download would be iCloud. You can download for your PC, and these days it does work; photos just appear. The arcane arrange of it is, well; but if you stick to the PhotoStream folder shouldn't have to worry about that. I use it with an iPad... I have the 6s and yes pixel level detail is disappointing (even compared to my Note 4), really hope Apple can sort this out asap! Skin tones especially have a very 'waxy' look about them, don't know what Apple got wrong, but its a far cry from what I was expecting.. Is there a reason you're looking at pictures taken using your phone, at pixel level?!. The fact that pixel level image quality has gotten worse means I won't be upgrading from my lovely 6. Let's hope Apple resumes the trend of improving image quality with each generation with the 7.. Hi Craig, reason is simple: to compare it to the 6 and other phones... its one of the easiest ways to check IQ. I hope Apple can sort it out with a firmware update to the phone cos the results are quite disappointing and not what one expects from dear ol' Apple, but to have previous gen Android smartphones easily besting the 6S is sad!. iPhone 6s and 6s Plus come with 12MP camera and 4K video.
