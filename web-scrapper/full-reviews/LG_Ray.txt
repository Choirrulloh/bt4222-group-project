LG Ray - user opinions and reviews. 16GB storage, microSD (dedicated slot) card slot. Pages: 1 2 ». This phone is total garbage i hay this phone for two months and i was going to my phone carrier company for fixing every week it kept rebooting al the time they eventually gave me another phone of the exact same model and the same thing happened whiting two days. This was my fist and last lg phone ever. please tell me about this phone camera and headset....???. I'm planning to buy it, i'm reading all kind of bad stuff for this device wich in my opinion is good for the money u spend, always see people compares samsung high end devices with this kind of phones, people talks a lot about phone specs but at the end they only uses it for basic apps, if u want get something better go straight And buy a g5 or s7 And shut up people want get too much for a few bucks cause r the only bucks they have left in their pockets, thanks lg for the different budget phones we can buy. This phone wasn't released to compete with flagships, in fact this phone was released to those areas where 4G is not very common, i wouldn't call this a mid-range phone, this is more like a budget phone. There are many people who wouldn't spend a crazy amount of money over a phone.. its ok but the chips and 1 ram is a fail. 3000 mAh with medium performance CPU + low Density LCD = Great Battery life..!!. with a 13Mp camera and 16 gb storage ? (not to mention micro SD slot that some manufacturer omited nowadays -_- ). And of course standard LG Service and Guarantee.. This phone is actually a Sweet spot for ... you can take it and actually USE it for everyday task.. without checking the battery indicator every few hour ( raise ur hand if u do it with your "Megalicious Performance Value For Money that everyone hyped about" Phone :D ). no frantically search for power outlet just after lunch... Samsung stopped looking phenomenal after S4 and S4. All their phones are just different in sizes and screen features, the apps are the same. Only cool about them are the sides. Waterproof and won't crack? welp some of my friends had XPeria and Samsung with these features but seems that not all phones with these brands are capable to do so.. sean, 26 Nov 2015 Another Samsung troll.... the only better thing is 1.5GB Ram > 1GB RAM.. more This looks kinda ugly too, and it is bigger than the G3 and G4.. Anonymous, 03 Dec 2015 like sammy for example... a series 2016 rocks !!!!!! Exactly! Samsung's 2016 A series is phenomenal!. Ashfique, 03 Dec 2015 This phone is really stupid. I mean even the moto G 3rd gen has 2gigs of RAM. I mean even the moto G 3rd gen has 2gigs of RAM. Instead of releasing such dumb phones LG should focus on building a budget and midrange lineup like all other manufacturers.. MT6592 is a 2 years old, Cortex A7 SoC. No LTE, no 64bit, oldscool RAM and eMMC support, etc. This phone is on the level of Galaxy S3. So this phone should be a joke from LG... I'm still surprised that people are ignoring the fact that it runs on Stock Android, NOT LG's UI. Running Stock means that the phone can do much better on 1GB of RAM than if it were to have LG's laggy UI. EDIT: Is this phone running stock though?. 1 GIG ram for that specs....gudluck LG. 5.5' 720p display - Insta Epic fail. LG keeps producing not interesting phones. what does this phone differ from lg class or magna or vista !!. so , LG please produce different features instead of just changing the name of the phone. Jestreal, 26 Nov 2015 Samsung galxy On7 is far better and more cheaper than this box called phone. the only better thing is 1.5GB Ram > 1GB RAM. and galaxy on 7 looks so ugly..

LG’s Ray is a mid-range phone for 3G markets with its 5.5-inch 720p screen. In an effort to offer customers in 3G markets a cheaper smartphone. alternative, LG announced the LG Ray. The 5.5-inch LG Ray is not full HD, but it features a 720p resolution. The phone also sports a metallic design and a removable 3,000mAh battery. A 1.4GHz octa-core processor powers the device, along with 1GB of RAM, which is disappointing — even for this budget phone.. The device’s design is similar to other LG phones, with the volume rocker on the back of the phone. It also includes familiar features such as Knock Code to unlock the phone and Gesture Shot for the camera. The speaker looks as though it is placed on the back of the phone, which means sound may be muffled by your hand or the surface of a table if it’s face up.. The Ray runs Android 5.1 and houses a 13-megapixel rear camera, as well as an 8-megapixel front camera, which is decent for a phone in this tier.. “Customers in 3G markets continue to be a priority for LG so we will continue to develop new products with these consumers in mind,” Juno Cho, president and CEO of LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company, said in the blogpost. “No matter the country or the device, every LG customers will receive a unique user experience with a balance of design, performance and value.”. The LG Ray will most likely not be seen in the U.S.. While the price hasn’t been announced yet, the phone has been rumored to cost around. 15,000 rubles or about $232, according to Android Authority .. The LG Ray is rolling out to former Soviet Union countries soon, followed by several parts of Latin America. The color options include silver, gold, and titan black.. The Kodak Mini Shot packs in Bluetooth and a printer — for $100. Hasselblad’s H6D-400c MS camera costs $48K and captures 400MP photos.

LG - LG + Android - Android +. If you find yourself on a budget and living within the CIS region or Latin America, LG has a brand new value proposition for you: the Ray.. Nestled within a frame made to look like metal, the LG Ray offers a 5.5-inch, 720 x 1280 resolution display, good for a pixel desnity of 267 ppi. System performance is powered by an unnamed, octa-core processor without. LTE (just HSPA+ 3G) and 1GB of RAM, while a large, 3,000 mAh cell keeps the lights on. The 158 gram Ray also packs 16GB of expandable storage, a 13-megapixel rear camera with an LED flash, and an 8-megapixel selfie snapper. In terms of software, we're looking at Android Lollipop with LG's custom skin on top.. Pricing is yet been revealed, so it remains to be seen if the LG Ray will prove to be worth people's hard-earned monies.
