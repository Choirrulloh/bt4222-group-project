By Vijay Thalpate | 29 Jan 2018. I using this phone since last 5 days, hence now writing this review.. I found phone performance is good. Fast battery charging, as committed my Samsung. Camera is good in day light but in night snaps it is little bit disappointing. (OnePlus 5T is better than this, but most of customer is facing issue of dust that is getting inside rear camera glass). No issue of network, where other phones show poor single strengths. Samsung pone is working nice in weaker signal areas. This comparison was done with few smart phones.. I enjoyed watching movies on big & sAMOLED display. (Display quality is good as compare to OnePlus). This pone is little bit heavier, this may be due to back side glass panel. I used OnePlus 5T & Samsung A8+ (Since last 5 days) I found Samsung A8+ is better than Onplus.. Was this review helpful? Yes No. Samsung Galaxy A8+ (2018) First Impressions.

Jump to Galaxy A8 (2018) news. For reasons best known to the company, Samsung decided to restructure its popular Galaxy A series for this year. The medium sized model previously referred to as the Galaxy A5 has been released as the Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018). As the naming suggests, this device is basically the mid-range version of the Galaxy S8, and that’s a burden that it carries with grace.. The Galaxy A8 (2018) sticks to the formula that has worked well for this premium mid-range series over the past couple of years. The handset has a metal and glass build which provides a premium look and feel. Weighing 172g and measuring 149.2 x 70.6 x 8.4mm, the Galaxy A8 (2018) has a 5.6-inch 1080x2220 pixel resolution Super AMOLED display with 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The handset is IP68 dust and water resistant.. This is the first mid-range handset from Samsung to feature an Infinity Display. While it doesn’t have curved edges, it’s firmly entrenched in the bezel-less territory. This also means that the handset doesn’t have a physical home button anymore and the fingerprint sensor can now be found below the camera on the back.. The Galaxy A8 (2018) is powered by a Samsung Exynos 7885 octacore processor with 4GB of RAM and 32/64GB storage options. It's coupled with a Mali-G71 GPU. The storage can be expanded up to 256GB with a microSD card. It also supports LTE Cat.11, Wi-Fi 802.11 ac and Bluetooth 5.0. It’s also the first premium mid-range handset from Samsung to support the Gear VR headset.. Names may change, but Samsung's software policy does not. Ergo, the Galaxy A8 (2018) runs the not-quite-recent Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box, with the Samsung Experience 8.5 UX on top. Looking at the update track record of comparable models, we expect the new A8 to receive monthly security updates for at least two years, plus two big updates for the Android operating system. The first of these will be the update to Android Oreo which should arrive later this year.. The Galaxy A8 (2018) is a device of firsts for Samsung. It’s the first mid-range smartphone from the company to feature a dual front-facing camera. Samsung has been highlighting this major selling point in its marketing materials for the handset.. It features a 16-megapixel primary front camera with f/1.9 aperture coupled with a secondary 8-megapixel f/1.9 camera with support for Live Focus. Users can easily switch between taking regular photos or close-ups with background blur. There's also a 16-megapixel f/1.7 camera on the back with video digital image stabilization and a Hyperlapse mode.. The Galaxy A8 (2018) has a non-removable 3,000mAh battery, that’s the same capacity as its predecessor. We had no qualms with the Galaxy A5 (2017)'s battery life so if further optimizations have been made, the new handset should be able to get you through the day easily, and then some.. The Galaxy A8 (2018) was officially announced in the last week of December 2017. Samsung started selling it in markets like Vietnam, South Korea and the Netherlands in the first week of January 2018.

It's slightly more expensive than the Galaxy A5 (2017) which was sold for €429 or $515 last year. Prices vary by market but this is a good baseline to keep in mind.

Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018), Galaxy A8+ (2018) unveiled with Infinity Display. Published: Tuesday, December 19, 2017, 10:08 [IST]. Samsung has finally announced the Galaxy A8 (2018) and the Galaxy A8+ (2018) smartphones, thereby putting an end to the rumors and speculations those have been hitting the headlines almost every other day. Though the naming scheme is different, these devices are the successors to the existing Galaxy A5 (2017) and Galaxy A7 (2017) models.. The new Galaxy A series smartphones are actually closer to the flagship Galaxy S series smartphones and bring something unique to the lineup. We say so as these mid-range smartphones boast the Infinity Display that we saw on the Galaxy S8 duo. Also, the smartphones have dual front cameras that will make them selfie-centric devices as well.. As of now, Samsung has not mentioned anything about the pricing of the Galaxy A8 (2018) smartphone duo. However, there are claims that these devices will be available for sale in early January 2018. These smartphones have been launched in four colors - black, orchid grey, gold and blue.. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!. Display Processor and Storage Camera Software Connectivity and Battery. The Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) and the Galaxy A8+ (2018) feature Infinity Display that was introduced by the S series smartphones. It goes without saying that the display will have an aspect ratio of 18.5:9. While the Galaxy A8 has a 5.6-inch FHD+ display, the Galaxy A8+ has a larger 6-inch display with the same FHD+ resolution. Notably, these are the first Galaxy A series smartphones to support Gear VR.. Both the Galaxy A8 (2018) and Galaxy A8+ (2018) smartphones equip an octa-core processor but the company is yet to reveal if these devices will have a Snapdragon or Exynos chipset. The Galaxy A8 features 4GB RAM and 32GB/64GB storage while the larger variant comes in two variants - one with 4GB RAM and 32GB storage and the other with 6GB RAM and 64GB storage.. Both the smartphones feature a dual camera setup at the front with a 16MP primary sensor and an 8MP secondary sensor with Live Focus support for the bokeh mode and f/1.9 aperture. It is touted that the smartphones can switch between the two sensors at the front to render the effect that is desired. At the rear, there is a 16MP selfie camera with a wider f/1.7 aperture. The rear snapper has digital image stabilization and hyperlapse.. Though the Galaxy A8 (2018) and Galaxy A8+ (2018) are advanced with dual front cameras and Infinity Display, the one aspect that is disappointing is the software part. These smartphones run Android 7.1 Nougat instead of Android 8.0 Oreo that is the latest iteration of the OS.. The Galaxy A8 smartphone duo come with USB Type-C port and other standard connectivity features such as 4G VoLTE and Samsung Pay for contactless mobile payment. The smartphones have been launched with the IP68 rating for water and dust resistance. Also, there is a fingerprint sensor at the rear of these smartphones as they feature the Infinity Display.. The Galaxy A8 (2018) is powered by a 3000mAh battery while the Galaxy A8+ (2018) makes use of a juicier 3500mAh battery. Both the batteries support fast charging as well..

While it may sound like a no-brainer, this question has a lot more nuance than it might seem.. So the question goes: today, should you buy a Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) or should you buy the year-old Samsung Galaxy S8 ? While conventional wisdom tells you that a flagship is always better and that the mid-range option is always cheaper, there's quite a bit more to this question at first glance. As unintuitive as it sounds, these two phones are actually competing with each other, so people in the market for one or the other should take some time to ponder their options.. First, it's important to note that Samsung has gotten into the groove of making its previous year's flagship features available in the current year's mid-range offerings. This is exactly the case with this year's Samsung Galaxy A8 and last year's Galaxy S8. The two are practically peas in a pod, with much of the same selling points. There are still some minor differences, but the two phones show off the same beautiful Samsung glass-back design, with large 18:9 displays and very capable cameras. The crux of the matter is this: you can get a Galaxy A8 (2018) today for around PHP 27,000, but the Galaxy S8 is a scant PHP 29,000 away. Do you get a brand-new phone cheaper, or do you get an older flagship-level phone for just a couple thousand more?. The new Galaxy A8 has Samsung's new Exynos 7885 chipset with an octa-core processor at 2.2Ghz, packs 4GB to 6 GB of RAM, and has 64 GB of internal storage. By the numbers, that's just a smidgen less powerful than the Galaxy S8's Exynos 8895 processor (or alternately a Snapdragon 835) clocked at 2.3 Ghz, with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage. In terms of real-world use, you won't see much difference between these two, even if you opt for the more generous 6 GB of RAM on the Galaxy A8.. The real decider might be the prowess of the cameras. The Galaxy S8 has one of the better cameras the smartphone world has seen, but it's still a single-camera solution with a 12-megapixel f/1.7 aperture lens. The Galaxy A8 has a similar single-camera lens, but it's bumped up to 16-megapixels and f/1.7 aperture. Don't let the numbers deceive you, though; the Galaxy A8 camera is slightly less capable and can only shoot up to 1080p for video, whereas the Galaxy S8 can go all the way to 4K. Further, the low-light performance of the Galaxy S8's camera is significantly better than the Galaxy A8's.. On the other hand, the Galaxy A8 has a dual-camera setup for its front camera, which takes significantly more compelling selfie portraits with Bokeh effects compared to the Galaxy S8's single camera solution.. So, on one hand you have a cheaper Galaxy A8 (2018) with slightly less performance, a less capable main camera, but a better selfie configuration. On the other you have the slightly more expensive Galaxy S8 with better flagship specifications, a better main camera, but less capable front camera. Is one worth more than the other? We've laid out the facts, the decision is ultimately yours. Which phone would you rather have?. Read more news on this product. Reviews of Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018). User Review : 1 Reviews.

Samsung Galaxy A8 and A8 Plus announced: Sleek, selfie-focused mid-rangers (Update: Pre-orders open in South Korea). by Bogdan Petrovan January 2, 2018. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. Comparing the Galaxy A8 to the current generation. Samsung Galaxy A8 and A8 Plus price and availability. Update (01/02): Pre-orders have now opened for the Samsung Galaxy A8 in South Korea. The device officially launches on January 5th forÂ. KRW 599,500 (around $564) and is available in black, gold, and blue.. There’s no word on a release date for the larger Galaxy A8 Plus in Samsung’s home region or availability details for a worldwide launch, but we’ll keep an ear open for any updates.. Original story (12/19/2017): Samsung just announced its new mid-range phones, the Galaxy A8 (2018) and Galaxy A8 Plus (2018).. Replacing the 2017 Galaxy A lineup, the Galaxy A8 and Galaxy A8 Plus feature attractive specs and a design that is inspired by the Galaxy S series. The coolest feature is the dual front cameras, which feature f 1.9 lenses and portrait mode.. In recent years, Samsung has released several popular phones in the mid range as part of the A series. The naming convention for these devices â Galaxy A3, Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 â conflicted with the way Samsung names its most important devices, the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series.. With the 2018 generation, Samsung has renamed the Galaxy A5 to Galaxy A8 (2018) and the Galaxy A7 to Galaxy A8 Plus (2018).. We donât know for now what happened to the Galaxy A3. Did Samsung kill it? Will it be folded in the Galaxy J series?. Read: What are the best Samsung smartphones you can get?. The Galaxy A8 and A8 Plus are the first Samsung phones with dual front cameras. These mid-rangers beat out the flagships to the punch, though dual front cameras have been a fixture on mid-range phones from other manufacturers.. The cameras feature f 1.9 lenses â basically, the lower the number the better â so they should give your selfie nice background blurs.. One of the cameras is 16MP, and the other one 8MP. Samsung says you can switch between them to get the type of shot you like, which makes it sound like they have different widths of angle.. Portrait modes are all the rage, and the Galaxy A8 and Galaxy A8 Plus are jumping on the bandwagon. You can take selfies and adjust the amount of blur in the background, before and after taking the image â this feature is called Live Focus and weâve seen it before on the rear dual camera of the Galaxy Note 8.. You also get stickers and a beauty mode to spice up your self-portraits.. The new Galaxy A8 (2018) and Galaxy A8 Plus (2018) look a lot like Samsungâs 2017 devices, mixing a smooth glass back with a metallic chassis and the 18.5:9 display form factor.. They are available in black, orchid grey, gold and blue.. The Galaxy A8 features a 5.6-inch Full HD+ (â+â denoting itâs an 18.5:9 panel), while the A8 Plus goes up to 6 inches, but keeps the same resolution.. The two phones share most of the key specs, including the cameras (16 MP PDAF f 1.7 on the back), an octa-core processor, 4GB of RAM, and 32/64GB of storage.. The smaller A8 features a 3,000 mAh battery. The A8 Plus gets an excellent 3,500 mAh â thatâs the same as the much pricier Galaxy S8 Plus.. Both phones feature fingerprint sensors (placed below the rear camera), USB Type-C, Samsung Pay (with MST, so you can use them on older points of sale), and IP68 water and dust resistance.. Compared to the 2017 Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7, the Galaxy A8 (2018) and Galaxy A8 Plus (2018) offer updated designs that follow the Galaxy S series (much smaller bezels, fingerprint sensor is now on the back), as well as improvements to the processor, RAM and memory.. The biggest new feature is the dual front camera. The screens are also larger, though the actual size of the phone is almost unchanged. Thatâs probably why the battery capacity remained roughly the same.. You will be able to buy the Galaxy A8 (2018) and Galaxy A8 Plus (2018) starting from January. Thatâs the only detail that Samsung has revealed so far, but we expect to learn more at CES Las Vegas , when weâll also go our hands on these two phones.. If the price of previous phones in the A series is any indication, the new A8 and A8 Plus will cost in the $350-$450 range, depending on the market..

Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) and A8 Plus (2018) manual and hands-on video leaks. by Scott Adam Gordon December 11, 2017. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. We’ve already seen some leaked images of the rumored Galaxy A8 Plus (2018) , giving us some clues as to what to expect from the handset. This A8 series, which is also said to include the Galaxy A8 (2018), is on course to replace Samsung’s A3, A5 and A7 devices for next year, despite that Google has yet to announce it.. That announcement is sure to come soon, however, as we’ve now got a glimpse of the user manual and a video of the A8 Plus in action.. The video arrives via Slashleaks Â. and it shows off what is believed to be a working model of the upcoming A8 Plus, as well as a potential specs list for it; check it out below (I recommend it with the volume on).. The specs include a 6-inch, 18:9, Full-HD+ display (flat, rather than curved) with octa-core Exynos 7885 chip, 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage space. In addition, the handset is expected to comeÂ. with a single 16 MP rear camera sensor, an 8 MP front camera, a 3,500 mAh battery with USB Type-C connector, and an IP68 certification for dust and water resistance. A rear-mounted fingerprint scanner can also be seen in the clip above.. How many of these specs will also feature in the regular Galaxy A8 we don’t know, but it’s likely that the Plus model has a larger display and bigger battery (and probably less RAM).. Meanwhile, leaker Roland Quandt has gotten his hands on what is believed to be the manual for the devices, which reaffirms the core design and lack of Bixby button on the side of the device.. Samsung Galaxy A8 and A8 Plus (2018) manual showing off the new 18:9 design – no Bixby button, FP reader “in the right place”.. bezels seem wider than on S8/Note8 https://t.co/YaiD3t9o8m pic.twitter.com/HSksm01QQS. â Roland Quandt (@rquandt) December 10, 2017. Quandt, via WinFuture.de , also suggests that the phones will run on Android Nougat , and notes that the Plus model may not make it to Europe.. As successors to the Galaxy A3, A5 and A7, the A8 and A8 Plus are expected to slot in behind the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus in terms of power and performance, acting as a lower-cost alternative to Samsung’s main flagship series.Â. Look out for more details on them soon, and let us know your thoughts on the handsets in the comments.. Samsung Samsung Galaxy A8 Plus (2018) Samsung Galaxy A8+ (2018).

As far as the looks are concerned, the much talked about “Samsung’s ‘Infinity Display’ has trickled down to the mid-range handset. The ‘Infinity Display’ with absolute minimal bezels were seen on the flagship phones of 2017, like Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 plus and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.. What makes this one beefier option is the front-facing camera. Both Galaxy A8 and Galaxy A8+ sport dual front facing camera lenses – a 16MP paired with an 8MP. The rear camera has a 16MP lens with PDAF. Both the devices are powered by an Octa-Core (2.2GHz Dual + 1.6GHz Hexa). Both the phones are capable of Fast Charging via USB Type-C. Although, with Android Oreo out for a couple of months now it would have been nice to see the phones running on Android 8.0 but the phone comes with Andoird Nougat 7.1.1.. With Samsung’s ‘Infinity Display’ on board, the fingerprint scanner moves to the back of the device, but Samsung has finally sought the location of the device with putting the scanner below the camera module and not next to it..

Mid-range Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) and A8+ (2018) go official with Infinity Displays. Adrian Diaconescu December 19, 2017 3:53 am. Samsung couldn’t wait for the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show debuting on January 9 in Las Vegas to unveil the company’s latest sleek Windows 10 Notebooks , and the same goes for a new generation of “Infinity Display” Android phones.. But these are not the heroes you might expect , bringing the killer design language of the Galaxy S8 , S8+ and Note 8 to the mid-range segment. The upper mid-range market, to be specific, as the Galaxy A8+ (2018) packs up to 6GB RAM and 64GB internal storage.. Both the Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) and A8+ (2018) come with FHD+ Super AMOLED screens yielding trendy 18.5:9 aspect ratios, and ironically, the overall humbler A8 produces a higher pixel density thanks to its smaller panel.. With 5.6 and 6 inches of usable screen real estate, the new thin-bezeled handsets can’t quite match the compact excellence of the 5.8 and 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 and S8+. The A8 (2018) and A8+ (2018) are slightly taller, wider and thicker, as well as significantly heavier than their high-end counterparts.. But they still look spectacular for what we can only assume will be fairly reasonable prices, with “ergonomic curved glass” on the back and front, metal frames, smooth curves and “comfortable grip.”. Aside from 1080 x 2220 display resolution, the two also share a single 16MP rear-facing camera with f/1.7 aperture, dual 16 + 8MP selfie shooters capable of Live Focus tricks, various bokeh effect adjustments and beautiful portrait shots, as well as an unnamed octa-core processor (probably the brand-new Exynos 7885), and alas, pre-installed Android 7.1.1 software.. The Galaxy A8 (2018) and A8+ (2018) are perfectly on par with the S8 and S8+ in terms of battery capacity, at 3,000 and 3,500mAh respectively, and they predictably support Samsung Pay while unexpectedly working with the Gear VR to provide an entry-level virtual reality experience. They’re also protected against water and dust, and the smaller model offers “just” 4GB RAM in combination with 32 or 64 gigs of digital hoarding space, while the A8+ (2018) comes in two memory configurations.. As far as availability goes, all we know is the two phones will arrive in “early January 2018” in unspecified markets..

Around back, each phone features more curved glass and a 16-megapixel rear camera with phase detection autofocus and an f/1.7 aperture.

The A8 offers 4GB of RAM, 32/64GB of storage, and a 3,000mAh battery, while the A8+ steps up to 4/6GB of RAM, 32/64GB of storage, and a 3,500mAh battery.. Rounding out the feature set for both phones is USB-C, Samsung Pay support, and Android 7.1.1 Nougat.

Smartphones with tall, all-screen designs are all the rage now, and these phones ought to help bring that kind of hardware to more people. They're also interesting because they have rear fingerprint readers below their displays, which could be a hint about where Samsung will place the fingerprint readers on the Galaxy S9 and S9+ ..

Galaxy Note 8 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ Android 8.0 Oreo update Galaxy S9 Galaxy S9+ Galaxy A8. Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) initial impressions. Home / News / Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) initial impressions. The idea behind Samsung’s Galaxy A series is simple: Take some key features from the flagship handsets, tone them down and package them into a more affordable device that’s a step above your average mid-range Android-powered smartphone. It all started with the first generation Galaxy A series that was released in 2015 and this idea has been refined every year since then. Announced a couple of weeks ago, the Galaxy A8 (2018) and the Galaxy A8+ (2018) are part of Samsung’s latest attempt at offering some of its best features at an affordable price point.. Samsung pushed the envelope on smartphone design with the Galaxy S8 last year. The handset’s Infinity Display has garnered a lot of praise for what it does for the look and feel of the flagship. Sticking to the script of toning down key features, Samsung gave the new Galaxy A handsets a flat Infinity Display but retained the 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The company also listened to the criticism it received because of the fingerprint sensor placement on the Galaxy S8 and made amends by positioning it below the rear camera for easy access. It went off-script as well this year by introducing a dual front-facing camera, a first for any Galaxy smartphone.. The company has made its premium mid-range smartphones progressively better over the past couple of years, and it’s a strategy that has paid dividends for Samsung. The Galaxy A is one of its best-selling smartphone series and with good reason. The Galaxy A8 (2018) and Galaxy A8+ (2018) certainly have what it takes to sustain this momentum, and today we’re offering our initial take on the A8 (2018), which I’ve had the chance to play around with for a day or so.. Like its predecessors, the Galaxy A8 feels every bit as premium as Samsung’s flagship offerings. That’s because the design is similar (two slabs of glass surrounding a metal frame), but with the curved edges missing. Now, those curves might not be an important feature as far as smartphone basics are concerned, but to me, the flat display feels unworthy of getting the Infinity Display tag. Too much bezel is visible on the A8, and other than the fact that the front side of the phone is all black, I don’t see how one can call it “infinity” when you can see so much bezel above all around the screen.. Thankfully, the A8’s AMOLED panel is as high in quality as any other AMOLED panel from Samsung, and the phone doesn’t feel as big as it should with a 5.6-inch screen. Oh, and Samsung is finally offering a notification LED on the A series. Sadly, the home button isn’t pressure sensitive, so you have to swipe up to access the navigation buttons inside a full-screen app. It also means you can’t wake the phone up with a hard press on the area around the home button.. But, I should point out that the lack of a pressure sensitive home button only stands out if you were previously using an S8 or Note 8, and not a lot of consumers will be shifting from either of the flagship devices to the A8 or A8+. And it’s nice to see that the fingerprint sensor is finally located in a sensible position. It’s still not as well placed as phones from other manufacturers, being too close to the rear camera, but it’s a step in the right direction.. Speaking of the camera, the 16-megapixel sensor at the back does a good job in daylight and struggles somewhat in low-light conditions. Performance of the dual front cameras with good lighting is impressive, especially with Live Focus enabled. We’ve already published a few samples , and while a conclusion is hard to reach right now, the overall camera experience seems to have been a point of focus for Samsung with the latest A series phones. We’re just hoping the rear camera isn’t too prone to blurring out images, which was a major issue with the cameras on the 2017 models (and not just because of a lack of image stabilization).. Okay, so what else have I noticed in my short time with the phone? Well, the loudspeaker on the side of the phone sounds quite good. Not flagship-grade, but certainly above average. Battery life seems to be good as well; I haven’t been using the phone for long, but judging by last year’s A series phones, battery life shouldn’t disappoint. The A8 (and A8+) also comes with facial recognition for unlocking the device.. The phone only seems to use the primary front camera for facial detection, and I wonder if things would be faster if the company employed both front cameras.. With the Galaxy A8 (and A8+), Samsung is giving consumers a boatload of features for the asking price. For now, my first impressions are positive, but we’ll be testing everything thoroughly in the coming days to see the kind of experience that the overall package offers.

Source : Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) isn't a successor to a specific An arrangement telephone. It's to a greater degree a trimmed Galaxy S8 variant for the majority with coordinating outline, screen, and the present number 8. Or on the other hand so Samsung would have us believe.Indeed, Samsung is changing its naming tradition by and by. While before the number meant the physical size of the telephone in the midrange class, now it has come to demonstrate the age it comes in and we're up to gen8 if the S and Note arrangement fill in as any direction. This isn't to imply that that the Galaxy A8 (2018) doesn't have an ancestor - it's the Galaxy A5 (2017). Furthermore, the new telephone is a redesign in all regards with the exception of maybe for the primary camera.Visually, the A8 is to be sure nearer to the S8. The correspondingly molded and measured bended glass-sandwich outline, the tall AMOLED screen, and the unique mark on the back are a portion of the highlights which demonstrate the nearby connection between the Galaxy A8 and the S8. There is even a remarkable selfie overhaul - the A8 now accompanies a double camera at the front with an assortment of impacts, incorporating picture photographs with defocused background.The Galaxy A8 (2018) appears like an insightful other option to the main event without losing a great part of the S8's appeal. What's more, if the cost is correct, at that point Samsung may have completed a superb 'S8 lite' model. #epoel ,gadgetzone help us to better. follow me on G+ : https://plus.google.com/u/0/ Lisence free Royalty : Backsound : by Bensound.com.
