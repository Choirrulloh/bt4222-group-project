Oppo F3 review: An affordable Oppo F3 Plus in a smaller package. Chinese smartphone maker Oppo recently announced. the Oppo F3, its latest smartphone in India. The F3 is the successor to the F1 and is geared at bringing all the great features that made the F3 Plus a good deal for the consumer at a lower price point. gain a much wider reach in the market with a lower price tag.. The company announced the smartphone on 4 May and it. is set to go on sale on 13 May. tested the F3 over a period of 8 days to see if Oppo has managed to keep the good bits. of the F3 Plus, while reducing the price tag on this slightly. We noted in our first impressions of the Oppo F3 that the device has the potential to be another winner for the company after the success of the Oppo F1 Plus. But will it hold up to the competition in the same price range? Let's find out!!. Oppo F3 is a good-looking device with a metal back and 2.5D glass front with a plastic. frame running along the sides of the device. The back plate featuring the typical Oppo logo is made of metal, but there are plastic caps at the top and bottom.. Despite the metal and plastic mix,. the F3 is well-built and feels sturdy without any squeaking parts. It feels really good to hold in hand and does not feel slippery in hand despite the metal back.. The 5.5-inch screen size of F3 makes it ideal for one-handed usage, unlike its predecessor F3 Plus. However, you may find it a. problem if you are trying to reach something on the opposite diagonally extreme with your thumb.. The F3 comes with the volume buttons on the top left side corner and the power button on the top right side of the smartphone along with the SIM tray. The top left side of the smartphone houses the dual Nano-SIM slot along with a third slot dedicated for expandable storage using a microSD card. It is good news for people who want to use two SIM cards and a memory card, all at once.. You will find the speaker grill, mic and the microUSB v2.0 port along with the 3.5 mm headphone jack on the bottom of the smartphone.. The design of F3 is nothing new. and it seems identical to other smartphones in the company's range.. The front of the device features the. proximity sensor, a dual-camera setup and a receiver. on the top end, while the home button with that impressive fingerprint reader dominates the bottom half, flanked by. two touch sensitive buttons on each side. The company has got most of the things right in the build and design department by decreasing the screen size and not moving to an all plastic body which is common with its competitors.. Oppo F3 features a 5.5-inch Full HD display and is powered by an Octa-Core MediaTek MT6750T processor clocked at 1.5 GHz. The smartphone comes with 4 GB RAM with 64 GB of an internal storage. The F3 offers the ability to expand the storage using a microSD card of up to 256 GB. The device is about 153 grams in weight with 153.3 x 75.2 x 7.3 mm dimensions.. The smartphone sports a 13 MP camera sensor with an f/2.2 aperture at the back along with PDAF and an. The important bits, however, sit on the front.. Oppo has added dual sensors on the front using a. 16 MP camera sensor with an aperture f/2.0 and an 8 MP camera sensor with an f/2.4 aperture.. Connectivity options include dual-SIM support, 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/ b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, hotspot, GPS with A-GPS and a microUSB v2.0 port with USB OTG support. Other notable features include an accelerometer, proximity sensor, a compass and a fingerprint scanner. The phone ships with Android 6.0 Marshmallow (with a custom skin) and a 3,200 mAh battery.. The 5.5-inch IPS LCD display panel on the F3 is really good and offers good viewing angles. The brightness does drop when viewed from extreme angles that is not the normal usage viewing scenario. The display reproduces good colours along with sufficient brightness and vividness but. I would have preferred a higher. is too reflective so it becomes impossible to read anything when held in direct sunlight.. You will need to move away from direct sunlight or find some shade to read any content on it. I should add that the screen is a fingerprint magnet and you will see yourself constantly cleaning up the grimy mess. So it is better that you invest in a good screen guard to prevent any damage to the screen while cleaning it up.. that the display settings do provide is an option of the 'Eye protection display' which is Oppo's take on 'Night mode' or a blue light filter. This can be adjusted with three presets (low, medium and high). which filters out the blue colour from the screen.. Oppo F3 runs a skinned version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with ColorOS 3.0. It is a bit surprising that a device released in 2017 does not feature Android 7.0 Nougat but the skinning is as comprehensive as Xiaomi MIUI or Samsung TouchWiz so it also adds features and brings some extra settings.. The ColorOS 3.0 looks very similar to the interface that runs on iOS devices ranging from rounded corners, App folders, the lack of an app drawer, the animation that comes on while removing the app. The similarities run deep to a level where the company has tried to integrate the setting section of the built-in apps in the ‘Settings’ section just like on iOS.. The skinned interface does not bother me much in the end because everything runs smoothly without any lag or stutter. The experience felt cohesive without any breaks or jittering especially when it came to native apps that come with the device. Third-party apps, however, did see some lag during app launches and multi-tasking. More on this the Performance section.. Oppo has added a number of preloaded apps including ‘Music’, ‘Videos’, ‘Photos’, ‘Theme Store’, ‘Security’, ‘Files’, ‘OPPO AppStore’, ‘Sound Recorder’, ‘Compass’, ‘WPS Office’, and ‘Backup and Restore’.. Oppo Music app and Theme store. Their apps are sufficient for anyone to get started out of the box and they are good enough to be replacements of their Google-made counterparts available on the Play Store.. One example about that would be the ‘Files’ app. I was not successful in transferring photo samples from the phone to the office system. Normally I would use a pen drive but I did not have a pen drive with sufficient free space at the time. Usually, I would head to Google Play Store to install ‘Solid Explorer’ for FTP server to share files on local networks as most apps by companies don’t have the built-in FTP server facility. But to my surprise, the ‘Files’ app by Oppo came with built in Server creation settings.. The software ran without any crashes. One thing that did irritate me was the notification center. I would want direct access my notifications instead of the toggles and the swipe from right to the left of the screen for notifications, which is counterproductive.. The company as added the ability to clone apps, configure gesture and motion to perform certain actions. Frankly speaking, skinned Android versions are not my preference. I would any day pickup Vanilla Android with no tweaks or additions, but I have to admit that I did not mind using Color OS 3.0 because of its consistency, smoothness, and design.. The Oppo F3 is underpowered on paper when one looks at the benchmarks. The device also scored about 53214 in the AnTuTu Benchmark which makes it sit. quite low in the rankings especially when compared to devices launched in 2011 (iPhone 4s) for example.. However, the benchmark results are contradictory to what. I concluded after using the device for a week. The device performs well in most usage scenarios which involve native apps by Oppo along with lightweight apps like WhatsApp, Uber, and others.. It is a bit surprising though that the device is powered by an Octa-Core MediaTek MT6750T with. for the price-point that we are paying. The reason for pointing out a MediaTek processor is that the 'underpowered' part creeps in while multitasking or launching apps. The slight slowdown is not noticeable while using native apps but it becomes evident while using heavy third-party apps and games. You will notice the half a second or in some cases one-second wait timings while switching between multiple apps in the multitasking mode.. The company has tried to address. by adding animations to shave off some precious milliseconds from the experience but it is bound get slower over time as you install more and more apps on your device.. One interesting thing to note is that the device did not heat up during my extensive testing period. It only warmed up after prolonged gaming sessions. The device started to heat up after 15 minutes of gaming but this is the usual case with most smartphones in this range. There was no lag while playing games like DeadTrigger2 and Asphalt 8.. The calling experience and voice quality is great on the device with no issues in the clarity of the sound or the reception. I would like to mention the brilliant fingerprint sensor as it is fast and accurate without any misfires. The speaker grill is available on the bottom end. of the smartphone which does not hinder the sound while playing music. Even though the sound of the speakers is good it can be drowned in a considerable large hall with background noise. The smartphone scored 2617 in the PCMark Work 2.0 performance test and 5607 in the Ice Storm Extreme test.. Oppo should have added a more powerful processor in its budget offering. They should probably look at the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 for the successor of the next F-series smartphone, the F4 or F4 Plus or may be even a F3S.. I have to admit that the Oppo’s front camera setup is impressive as this is the first time I have tried the front camera on a smartphone and not ended up deleting the images. They are good enough for me to even consider uploading them on social media unlike selfies from other smartphones where I have come to accept the fact that nothing can be done about the bad quality of the selfies on smartphones these days.. The highlight of the smartphone is the dual camera setup along with a wide angle mode where you don’t need a selfie stick and just with a flick of a button, the camera switches to the wide mode.. The wide mode (or Group Selfie mode) is really impressive in terms of the sheer area and wideness of the frame. One thing to note here is that the wide angle mode does come with its trade-offs where you will end up sacrificing colour reproduction and dynamic range.. The normal camera performs great and it comes with a ‘Bokeh effect’ mode in the ‘Beauty’ mode which emulates the ‘Bokeh’ effect that can be found in photos with DSLRs. The camera UI is simple and offers options like 'Timelapse', 'Video', 'Photo', 'Beauty', 'Panorama' in addition to 'Normal', 'Ultra HD', 'Gorgeous color filters', 'GIF', Double Exposure', and 'Expert Mode in the 'Photo' menu.. The rear camera of Oppo F3 is decent and the photos are good with an. impressive amount of colour reproduction and detail in images. I should give props to Oppo software team for doing a good job with the HDR implementation as the images were balanced and did not over do with the HDR-effect. There was a minimal amount of halo around objects. I was impressed with the quality of images, contrast and colours of the photos in ideal conditions with sufficient daylight and the software did a good job in controlling the noise in almost all situations.. But the good part about the rear camera ends there.The images were a mess in low light with a grain-fest that painted the entire photos. Software does not seem to be optimized to adjust ISO and shutter speed as most photos had motion blur along with excessive noise in low light conditions. The camera sometimes failed to focus accurately in low light or less than ideal lighting conditions. I verified that the rear camera sensor is not bad as I was able to click better, clear photos in low light in the 'Expert Mode'. But then again, not everyone has a tripod along with a mobile phone holder for better photos in manual mode.. The Oppo F3 is equipped with a 3,200mAh non-removable lithium-ion battery which does a good job in powering the device. Despite the capacity, the battery life provided by Oppo F3 is impressive. The device ended up giving me a battery life of about 7-8 hours during a normal work day.. The normal day included 2.5-3 hours of music, 15-20 photos, constant internet usage over 4G and about 1 hour of gaming with a lot of WhatsApp and Telegram messages. The smartphone scored about 11 hours and 20 minutes on the battery intensive PCMark Work battery life 1.0 test which is pretty good.. One thing to note is that the smartphone software warns you of the mobile apps that are using a considerably high amount of battery usage. The software feature 'Energy Saver' allows you to give the operating system rights to ‘automatically optimize’ when the system detects an abnormal amount of power drain from any app installed on the device.This helps conserve the battery life in case you don't know which specific app is responsible for hogging your battery life.. The F3 also has inbuilt 'Low Power Mode' which disables GPS, Wi-Fi, mobile network, Bluetooth and personal hotspots while shortening the lock screen time and screen brightness. The software also has redesigned 'Power Consumption Details' that. let you see what apps are using the battery in a more comprehensive way.. Last but not the least, the F3 comes with a microUSB 2.0 port and does note feature. the latest Type-C reversible USB port. Add to this the lack of fast-charging. But thankfully Oppo opted to include a power adaptor that provides 5.0V charging capacity at 2A. This really helps with the situation.. Instead of the painful experience of charging with a 1A power adaptor the 2A charger. gets the smartphone from 0 to 100 percent in about 1 hour and 44 minutes.. The Oppo F3 price places it in the mid-range for smartphones. This smartphone may not be for everyone given the MediaTek processor and average back camera. But the device performs and shines on the features that it focusing on. You get a well-crafted metal body with some plastic bits, a quick fingerprint reader, decent software and class-leading selfie camera in a slim package.. This device may not compete in terms of specifications on paper but this is not meant for the specification war.. I can’t recommend any other device for selfies in the same range but if you want to look at better specs and don’t mind an average selfie camera and a larger display, then you can go in for Asus Zenfone 3. Zenfone 3 comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB internal storage with expandable storage slot offering a much better package than F3. The device went on sale for Rs 27,999 but now it is selling for Rs 21,999 .. If you are not a ZenUI fan then you can look at. which is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 and 4 GB RAM. Lenovo is also offering a compelling device with the. slightly pricey Moto Z Play as it offers a Snapdragon 625 octa-core processor with an Adreno 506 GPU with Android Nougat for Rs 24,999. Then there's the Vivo V5s that is priced at Rs 18,990, but comes with a plastic body. In short, despite it slightly underpowered processor, it is hard to find something better with a metal body, slim design and a great selfie camera in this range.. The Oppo F3 features a 5.5-inch FHD IPS display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and is powered by a 1.5GHz octa core processor and has 4GB of RAM. It comes with 64GB of inbuilt storage, expandable upto 128GB and has a 13.0-megapixel rear camera and 16.0 + 8.0-megapixel front camera.

OPPO is expected to come out with two new things this coming weekend, on August 12, in the country. First, it will launch a Red Edition of the successful OPPO F3 phone. Second, it is set to open a new concept store at SM Aura in Bonifacio Global City on the same day.. The selfie-centric OPPO F3 smartphone, which debuted last May, initially arrived with only two color variants: Gold and Rose Gold. Apparently, because of a huge demand, the Chinese tech firm also released a Black OPPO F3 but for a limited time only. This time, the successful device is getting a paint job once again. The OPPO F3 will be available in red color, courtesy of a Facebook post by OPPO. Red is known as the symbol of love, power, good fortune, courage, and strength, making it a popular color choice. If you are a fashion enthusiast who seeks a phone which reflects your inner personality, the Red OPPO F3 can be a great option. Furthermore, the scarlet-colored OPPO F3 will arrive in the Philippines on August 12. Yes, you have heard it right! The new model of the OPPO F3 handset will show up in our home country this weekend.. As per the teaser image released by OPPO's subsidiary in the Philippines, the new OPPO F3 model will have a black face which suits the metallic red finish of its aluminum rear panel. Noticeably, it has a close resemblance with the red-colored OPPO R9s design-wise. There are no expected change in the specs and features of the new variant of the OPPO F3. It will still sport a 5.5-inch IPS display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Under the hood, it comes with a MediaTek MT6750T octa-core processor clocked at 1.5GHz with Mali-T860MP2 GPU. It packs 4GB of RAM and 64GB internal flash storage with support for expandable memory of up to 256GB via microSD card. It also runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow-based Color OS 3.0. On the camera department, it features a 13MP rear snapper with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and LED flash. Being a selfie-centric device, it goes with a dual camera setup, comprised of a 16MP + 8MP sensor, on the front. The handset packs a 3200mAh battery to keep the lights on.. Apart from the launch of the Red OPPO F3 on August 12, a new concept store will also open in the country at the same time. The exact location of the newest OPPO concept store is at SM Aura in Bonifacio Global City. Are you now excited to see the new OPPO F3 with a scarlet hue?. Read more news on this product. OPPO F3: The First Selfie Expert is still there to be sold. OPPO F3 put the manufacturers firmly on the mobile device market. One of the most popular and well-received, it still continues to drive sales despite the larger next-gen F3 Plus entering the market. This device now enters the mid-ranging market with just those features.. OPPO F3 is a stunningly sleek device with rounded corners and edges. A solid all-metal body, its symmetrical design is what wins over buyers. The single capacitive button up front, 3 on the sides and an iPhone-like rear camera placement singles it out in the crowd with ease.. OPPO intelligently curved the rear end in for a confident grip and easy one-hand usage, although users will need to stretch a bit. Up front, it does sport a dual front camera. The 7.35 mm thin profile weighs in at 185 grams. To sum it up, this device is suave, sleek, sturdy and compact without a doubt.. Coming to the front camera setup later, this is one of the most surprising winning features in this device. This 5.5-inch IPS LCD has a native screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Considering that this is a mid-ranging, an FHD display module of this quality is a rarity. Graphics quality and depth are simply stunning and way above expectations even when it was first launched thanks to a 386 PPI pixel density.. OPPO F3 scored high on multi-core performance figures as it runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8976 Pro processor also known as the 653 series Snapdragon. It has an Octa-Core setup with core speeds going all the way up to nearly 2.00 GHz. This is rated as one of the best image processing setups around.. And that's because it comes with an Adreno 510 series GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) which comes in handy for strong multi-media performance. Also, it is compatible with X9 LTE providing download speeds of 300 Mbps, thanks to dual-channel network support.. Coming to what sets this device apart, it has a 16 MP primary image-capture camera aided by an 8 MP wide-angle lens module. Together, this setup can process images sharply and quickly. The wide angle allows added subject coverage and depth while the 16 MP adds quality to give users the best selfies they can expect. Multiple added filters also come with custom image enhancement apps. An added Dual-Tone LED flash along with the f/2.0 aperture allows umpteen image quality in low light conditions.. The rear camera is a 16 MP which is on par with its counterpart. It comes with a similar aperture setup and PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus). OPPO F3 also has a Pro mode where users can adjust shutter speed and other settings for stunning still imagery. 4K video recording capabilities come up with strong results too, thanks to added OIS (Optical Image Stabilization).. OPPO F3 works on a 4 GB RAM. Internal storage comes in at 64 GB. You can extend its external storage to a maximum of 128 GB via microSD slots.. This device runs on a Non-removable 4000 mAh Lithium Ion battery and it comes with quick-charging tech and apps.. OPPO F3 is based on an Android 6.0 Marshmallow and users have the option to install the latest updates straight. OPPO's in-house UI software Color OS works over the stock Android for more added functions. This device will continue with ColorOS 3.0.. Philippines are an important market for OPPO. Hosting a number of manufacturers as well as a rising economy, Philippines are considered a vital market especially in the mobile device segment. OPPO F3 was always a popular device and with the release of the latest F3 Plus, this device takes all of its own plus points to the mid-ranging segment. Sales in Philippines are strong and look likely to continue.. User Review : 2 Reviews. Pangit pag dating sa video recording.!!!. Ok sya sa selfie, pero pagdating sa video recording, pangit...

The group selfie mode, true to its name, can really help when you’re clicking a group selfie. You can accommodate a lot more people in a photograph just by clicking on the group selfie icon in the front camera app. With the group selfie mode switched on, six people can easily fit into a vertical picture..

I didn’t have to struggle in bright outdoors to look at the display. I liked playing games and watching videos thanks to good colour reproduction. The home button in Oppo F3 doubles as fingerprint scanner, which was quick at all times when I tried unlocking the phones, which is great.. Oppo F3 handles multitasking with ease, and didn’t give me many reasons to complain. Even with multiple tabs open, I could smoothly switch between them and didn’t experience any lag, crashes. Another good thing is I could enjoy graphics heavy games such as Asphalt 8 without experiencing any noticeable heating issues.. For me, one of the most important things in a smartphone is a good battery given I like to watch a lot of videos on my device. Oppo F3 didn’t disappoint me on the front either. On moderate to heavy usage, Oppo F3 lasts easily for a day with 23-25 per cent battery left at the end (if you charge it to 100 per cent in the morning). In the PCMark battery test, it scored around 10 hours for us, which is a pretty good score. It takes about two and a half hours to get fully charged from two percent battery left.. The absence of dual speakers was a bit of a disappointment for me. I mentioned earlier that I like watching a lot of videos on phone, and that doesn’t necessarily mean I always use earphones along. Give the smartphones is priced at close to Rs 20,000, I definitely expected it to do better in the sound department.. I got these data notifications, reminding me of how much data I used, which I found annoying. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find an option turn off these reminders.. Oppo F3 is a good buy thanks to its good overall performance. Of course, it excels in the selfie department, but you can’t ignore the design, battery life and performance. Go for Oppo F3 if you have a Rs 20,000 budget, and are looking for a device that does not compromise on most fronts. The phone is a toned down version of F3 Plus, which almost costs Rs 31,000. If you were waiting for an affordable F3 Plus, then F3 is a pretty good deal for you.. For all the latest Technology News , download Indian Express App. © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd.

5.5-inch Full HD In-cell display, 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution, ~401ppi. 1.5GHz MediaTek MT6750T 1.5GHz octa-core processor. 64GB internal storage, expandable via microSD up to 128GB. 16-megapixel + 8-megapixel wide-angle front cameras. Design is elegant but boring, typical iPhone-ish look. If you liked the OPPO F3 Plus but having a gigantic 6-inch display isn’t your cup of tea, don’t worry, OPPO still got you. What we’ll be looking at today is the OPPO F3, the smaller brother of the F3 Plus.. The OPPO F3 Plus was one of the first smartphones to ever feature a dual front-facing camera, a feature that’s apparently trendy nowadays. The OPPO F3 still pretty much carries everything that the F3 Plus has, but only at a smaller footprint.. But the thing is, is the OPPO F3 worth it? Does the dual-camera setup work the way it should? Other than taking selfies, can the device satisfy its users in other aspects? Let’s figure that out.. The OPPO F3 shares pretty much the same design cues with its larger brother. This thing has a 5.5-inch screen, while its bigger sibling is a 6-incher. While the OPPO F3 is still undeniably big, it still feels small and compact, especially since I just came from a review of a large device. For me, this smartphone has just the right size and weight. Not too big, but also not too small.. The OPPO F3 is also beautifully crafted in unibody metal, which is standard for a device in this caliber. And if it weren’t still obvious for some, this thing really looks like an iPhone. The reminiscent looks came from its all-white face, subtly rounded corners, and the metal back plate. All of which are the staple looks of Apple’s iconic smartphone.. Probably one distinguishable difference between this device and the OPPO F3 Plus is the missing six-string antenna bands. The said design touch is not on the OPPO F3, which is really disappointing considering that despite it is visually minuscule, it brought an extra spice to the handset’s almost boring look. Plus, it seems like the only design aspect that this device has that can’t be found on the iPhones.. At the front of the device, we have the said 5.5-inch Full HD display, the 16-megapixel and 8-megapixel front-facing cameras, the earpiece, ambient light and proximity sensors, the capacitive recent apps and back buttons (both of which are backlit) and the fingerprint scanner.. At the top, we only have a microphone for noise cancellation while at the bottom we have the built-in speaker, microUSB port, the primary microphone and a 3.5mm headphone jack.. The loudspeaker on the OPPO F3 works well. It has well-balanced sound, the low frequencies a.k.a bass parts are audible, while the highs/treble are not painful in the ears. The drivers inside also outs decently loud volume. It can surely fill a quiet room.. At the left, we have the volume controls. On the other side, we have the SIM tray that can house either two nano SIM cards or swap the other one to a microSD of up to 128GB. We also have the lock/power switch on this side.. The buttons on this smartphone feel tactile and satisfying to press. They also have an ultra-thin profile, which compliments the overall sleek look of the device.. At the back, we have the 13-megapixel primary camera with dual-tone flash. We also have some tiny lines which I’m guessing to be the antenna bands. And of course, we have here the OPPO logo and the ugly compliant signs.. The OPPO F3 has a 5.5-inch Full HD In-cell display, which has a 1920 x 1080 resolution and is being populated by 401 pixels-per-inch.. If you noticed, the company used a slightly different panel for the OPPO F3, even different from the F3 Plus’s IPS display. This thing has an In-cell display panel that’s projecting everything in your eyes.. For a quick hardware lesson, these in-cell displays basically eliminate the touch sensor module of the display and combine it to the actual LCD panel, thus, creating a single layer. With this type of display technology, the entire display panel will have a thinner and lighter profile when compared to other display technologies out in the market today. This will then translate to an overall lightweight smartphone, or giving an extra room for the engineers to beef up the hardware inside. Say, a having a larger battery.. Quality wise, the images it can produce is almost comparable to an IPS display. Colors are good with the just right saturation; contrast is also impressive with deep blacks. And of course, the sharpness is something you might really expect for a 1080p panel. Combined with its large 5.5-inch dimensions, watching videos, or playing games are enjoyable on this smartphone.. We have a MediaTek SoC that’s powering the OPPO F3. A processor of choice that may raise the eyebrows of a lot of people. A lot of smartphone “enthusiasts” would rather go with a Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered device if they will be shopping in the sub-Php15k category. However, it looks like the OPPO F3’s nature isn’t really directed to those who are always hungry for processing power. This thing still has an octa-core processor, and a lot of novelty features that almost justifies that price tag.. With that said, we have a 1.5GHz MediaTek MT6750T octa-core processor, backed with 4GB of RAM and a Mali-T860 GPU. Still some pretty interesting set of hardware, despite the second-rate branding.. So, how does it perform? Well, it was fine. The device was able to cope-up with my daily use. I was able to game comfortably with decent frame-rates. From SIM City: Build It, a simulator that’s processor-demanding, and EA Sports UFC which can be stressing in the graphics side of things. On the downside, the chipset’s thermals kind of increased after intensive gaming.. Th 4GB of RAM was also able to take everything well. I was able to open and switch between different applications seamlessly.. Overall, if you’re a casual user who is more into social media and other day-to-day applications, and just casually gaming on the side, then you will be satisfied with the OPPO F3’s performance.. The OPPO F3 has the same home button/fingerprint scanner implementation with the F3 Plus. The company used the iPhone 7-like approach on this one by removing the mechanical button. It’s now only the fingerprint scanner, which also acts as a home button when you tap it.. And just like the sensor found on the bigger variant, the one we have here also has the same impressive performance. The sensor has a success rate of almost 90%. You can instantly jump to the home screen even when the screen is off and locked.. I still have the same beef with OPPO’s interface design on the F3. Other than the slightly outdated Android 6.0 Marshmallow, it’s the slightly annoying ColorOS 3.1 interface that they have implemented on this device that ruined it for me. I would love to see a stock Android look for my Android, not an iOS copycat. But that’s just a personal preference.. coming out today, some of them even released right before the OPPO F3. And what makes things worse is that it is clearly not sure if this can be updated to a newer version of Android considering that they will still have to tailor it to work well with their own ColorOS interface. Based on their history with the OPPO F1s , it would take months (or a year) before the update would arrive.. But nonetheless, I’ve still seen a lot of people liking the interface of the OPPO F3. They favor its simple, minimalistic and iOS-ish looks. Which, in my opinion, actually doesn’t look that bad.. OPPO used the same Helvetica Neue on the system fonts, the native apps’ icons look identical with Apple’s – the buttons on the drop-down menu, the settings menu, the lock screen, and probably the most identical of them all, the camera app.. Now we head over to the highlight feature of this device – the camera. To start, we have the highlight of the show, the dual-front facing cameras. OPPO used a 16-megapixel sensor and an additional 8-megapixel one with a wide-angle lens. There’s no front-facing flash, but its software can lit the screen up to beam additional light. These cameras are also backed with tons of software filters, a whole system dubbed as the Beautify effect.. The two front cameras on the OPPO F3 helps the users to take group shots, without the worry that some subjects might not fit in the photo. On the other hand, if you chose to take only a picture of yourself, there’s the 16-megapixel sensor to make sure everything is sharp and doesn’t have distorted corners. Also, with two cameras pointing in the same direction, you can take images with a shallow depth-of-field, or more commonly known as the Bokeh effect.. The 16-megapixel sensor on this thing can surely take impressive selfies. The images that I was able to produce looks really bright, even at low-light scenarios. The contrast and saturation are also decent, for as long as you set the focus right, and the sharpness is on-point. The Beautify 4.0 also works well for its purpose.. Other than the Beauty effect, the front-facing camera also has other different modes: Gifs and Double Exposure.. The secondary 8-megapixel front shooter also shares the same characteristics. Despite having a 50% cut on the resolution, it was still able to take decent photos. It can take images with good exposure, decent color, and contrast. And while it is not as sharp as the 16-megapixel that’s beside it, the difference is barely noticeable.. The wide-angle lens is also not just perfect for taking group shots, but it also works well when you’re taking a selfie with a large object in the background. Say, you’re traveling alone and you like to take a selfie with an amazing background.. And despite its impressive front-facing shooters, the OPPO F3 still has a primary camera at the back. We have a 13-megapixel shooter that comes with a dual-tone flash.. The images you can take on this thing is equally impressive. Impressive colors and contrast, sharpness are on point, the dynamic range is decent and the depth-of-field is surprisingly good.. The OPPO F3 comes equipped with all the essential mediums for you to stay connected. This thing can take two Nano SIM cards, both capable of 4G LTE connectivity.. There’s also a WiFi 802/11 a/b/g/n. The mobile network garnered interesting speed test results, although it would actually depend on the geographical location. The WiFi antenna was also able to connect seamlessly to our home network, with good strength reliability.. This thing also has Bluetooth 4.0, which played nice with both of my wireless headphones and speakers. There’s also a GPS and A-GPS in tow. Although it would have been nice to see NFC present on this thing, despite its not-so-mainstream feature.. The OPPO F3 has 3,200mAh non-removable battery. This is a capacity that’s common to smartphones with the same screen size. The longevity that I was able to get from it is was also pretty conventional.. The F3 took around 10 hours before it went from 100% to 20%. That result was generated during moderate to heavy usage. Which includes web browsing, scrolling through different social media applications and streaming videos online.. With that result, it is safe to say that the OPPO F3 can last you for a whole work or school day. Just like most device, you would still have to recharge this thing every night.. It looks like OPPO created a fine follow-up to the F3 Plus. However, since they are pretty much the same device, the OPPO F3 also took the things I. Like what I have said earlier, the OPPO F3 runs on an outdated version of Android. This can be a huge deal-breaker for a lot of people, especially those who value the software side rather than the hardware.. Also, I think this handset is a bit pricey for what it is. At a price tag of Php16,990 , there are already a few alternatives out there that offer better features.. But like what I said in our F3 Plus review , not many handsets have two front-facing cameras in this market.. Also, other than the good set of cameras in front, the sensor found in the back can also take good quality photos. There are also other highlights like the impressive display and one of the fastest fingerprint scanners today.. To wrap it up, I really think that the OPPO F3 is a decent smartphone overall. However, I think people should just wait for a little while until the price goes down a little bit. That’s just me, though, because selfies and groufies aren’t really my thing.. If taking selfies and group photos is really your thing, then head on and buy the OPPO F3. You can purchase it on all OPPO stores and kiosks nationwide for Php16,990. It’s also available for installment via Home Credit.. More From NoypiGeeks OPPO F1s Review: Selfie Game Strong!

Roydon Cerejo , 22 May 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Oppo F3 has a secondary selfie camera with a wide-angle lens. App performance and features are good but not competitive enough. The Oppo F3 is priced at Rs. Oppo’s dual selfie camera feature now comes to the sub-Rs. 20,000 price segment with the Oppo F3. We reviewed the F3 Plus. back in March, which apart from being a good smartphone, had a practical use case for the secondary front camera, a feature we really appreciated.. The company has now brought that same camera setup to a more affordable price segment, and in essence, this model replaces the ageing Oppo F1s. In order to achieve price point, Oppo has made a few compromises in the materials used for the chassis, the rear camera, and the processor under the hood. Let’s see if the new Oppo F3 can still deliver good value despite these reductions.. Oppo F3 design and build quality If you’ve use the Oppo F3 Plus or at least held it, then you’ll instantly appreciate the smaller size of the Oppo F3. The phone is fairly slim at 7.3mm and light. It's a lot more pocketable compared to its. The 5.5-inch display with slim borders on either side makes it easy to use this phone one-handed, however the notification shade is still a bit of reach even for those with large hands. The sides of the display don’t blend with the body very smoothly, and the pre-applied screen protector gets in the way every time you swipe left or right.. The layout of the buttons and ports has't really changed compared to our last few experiences with Oppo smartphones. There’s a large capacitive Home button below the screen that’s flanked by two capacitive navigation keys, which are backlit. The power button is on the right, while the volume buttons are on the left. The SIM tray can accommodate two Nano SIMs and there’s a dedicated slot for a microSD card (up to 128GB). The chassis is built using plastic except for the back plate, which is metal. This surface is prone to scuffs so it’s advisable to use the bundled silicone case with the F3.. We found the brightness of the display on the Oppo F3 to be sufficient for outdoor use, and colours don’t get jarring like they did on the. The display is fairly sharp thanks to the full-HD resolution, and can resist damage thanks to the use of Corning Gorilla Glass 5. We didn’t have any issues with touch response either. The audio socket, Micro-USB port, and speaker grille are all on the bottom.. Overall, the Oppo F3 doesn’t disappoint in terms of build quality and aesthetics. It looks and feels very much like the Oppo F1s, which can be a good thing if you liked that design. In the box, you get a 10W power adapter, a data cable, a headset, a silicone case, a SIM ejector tool, and the instruction manuals.. Oppo F3 specifications and features We understand that Oppo had to cut corners in order to bring down the price of this phone, but the choice of SoC is slightly disappointing. The F3 is stuck with an octa-core MediaTek MT6750T SoC, which is a mild refresh of the MT6750 seen on the Oppo F1s. From what we can tell, it only has a higher GPU clock speed. In benchmarks, the F3 produces decent numbers. We got 53,023 points in AnTutu but GFXbench resulted in just 17fps during a run of the T-Rex test.. The phone also has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, which is plenty for today's apps and games. Other specifications include Bluetooth 4.0, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n, USB-OTG, GPS, a proximity sensor, a compass, and a gyroscope. There’s also support for 4G with VoLTE, but this phone lacks FM radio.. The Oppo F3 still uses ColorOS 3.0, based on Android 6 Marshmallow. The interface has a strong likeness to iOS, which is noticeable in some of the icons for system apps. Pulling down the notification shade only shows you quick settings toggle switches,. you have to swipe right to get to your notifications, which can be annoying. The fingerprint sensor works well and you can lock apps and files with it. Certain apps like WhatsApp can be cloned so you can have a second instance running for your second SIM card.. There are some on-screen and screen-off gestures to aid in single-handed use and let you open apps when the phone is in standby. Oppo also has its lockscreen magazine, which when enabled, cycles through different wallpapers. O-Cloud is for backing up your contacts and messages, and there's a custom app store for curated apps. Other preloaded apps include Google’s suite, Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, and WPS Office.. Oppo F3 performance, camera, and battery life Despite the slightly dated SoC, there isn’t any noticeable lag in the interface. The Oppo F3 handles multitasking pretty well too. The phones gets a bit warm while gaming or watching videos for an extended period of time, but not to the extent that usage is hampered. Button feedback and placement is good and we didn’t have any issues with call quality either. There is a notification LED, placed next to the front cameras,. but it’s only triggered for missed calls and messages, not WhatsApp or other apps. The volume level for alerts is good but the placement of the speaker isn’t ideal, and your palms tend to block it when gaming or watching videos in landscape mode.. Full-HD videos play just fine and we didn’t have any trouble with our high-bitrate files. There is a sound enhancement feature built into the OS called Real Sound Technology, which is jointly developed by Oppo and Dirac Research. The effect isn’t very significant when using the bundled headset, but can be felt better with more capable headphones.. Tap to see full sized Oppo F3 camera samples. Around the back, we have a 13-megapixel sensor with Dual PDAF and an f/2.2 aperture. Focusing is quick in good lighting although we noticed that the speed dips a bit in low light. Landscapes taken in daylight have good detail although the colours could have been a little more vivid. Auto HDR mode works well too. Macros look good on the phone’s display but aren’t very sharp once you actually zoom in. Low-light shots are acceptable but details are a bit lacking in landscapes and macros. The single LED flash isn’t too powerful either.. Oppo F3 selfie camera - normal (left) vs. However, it's the front cameras that are the main stars here, and just like on the F3 Plus, they do a good job with selfies. The primary 16-megapixel shooter captures detailed shots but doesn’t always get light metering right, especially if you’re shooting against a bright background. The secondary 8-megapixel sensor captures a wider field of view thereby allowing more people to fit in a frame, but keep in mind that this also introduces some barrel distortion.. The quality of images is not as good with the secondary front camera as it is with the primary one, especially in low light, but it’s acceptable. The screen flash really helps in reducing noise from faces but there's no escaping noise in the background of a shot. There’s a blur mode which only works for the main front camera and creates a pseudo-bokeh effect. Beauty mode lets you enhance the look of your skin. They're fun features and work relatively well.. You get the usual variety of shooting modes that we’ve seen before, including Expert Mode, which lets you set shutter speed and focus and also lets you save RAW files. The camera app is designed well and is easy to navigate. Video recording tops out at 1080p for the front and rear cameras, and quality is pretty good.. The 3200mAh battery easily manged to power this phone through a full day’s worth of regular usage. We got about 10 hours and 33 minutes of continuous video playback, but we expected better. The 10W power adapter helps charge the phone relatively quickly, but we still wish real fast charging was supported.. Verdict The Oppo F3 is priced at Rs. 19,990, which we feel is a bit on the higher side considering the processor it's packing. However, there isn’t much competition right now as it's the only smartphone in this segment with this sort of dual camera feature. If that doesn't matter and you’re looking for a bit more power under the hood, then you always have the Moto G5 Plus.. The Oppo F3 is a good upgrade over the Oppo F1s, but there are areas that could have used some improvement. FM radio is still absent, and many people in India use this form of entertainment even today. ColorOS 3.0 is beginning to feel a little dated now and there’s still no clarity on whether any of the new F3 series will get an update to even Nougat, considering that Google is gearing up for its Android O launch. Last but not least, the performance of both the front and rear cameras is not as good as with the F3 Plus.. At the end of the day, the Oppo F3 is meant for those who can't (or don't want to) spend a premium on the F3 Plus. It definitely is more affordable, but that's because of the compromises you have to make..
