There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Finally an affordable and good buy for people mesmerized with Sony smartphones. Now that's what I expect in an Xperia. Simply unpack the phone and it'll be a 'love at first sight' with your new phone! Pros: 1. No lag whatsoever, even after intense gaming. A little bit of heating is totally normal. 2.Internal space provided is sufficient for a lot of stuff. However, I'd recommend installing an app for occasional memory and space cleanup. The camera - oh where do I even begin! ITS AWESOME with its manual focus now being able to adjust the exposure of an intended click in SPECIFIC AREAS. Just focus on a darker part of the shot, the exposure increases for that area without affecting the rest of the area. Its bad and the sound coming out feels like its from a Chinese handset. Should've made the charging port a micro-USB instead of a custom "I don't know what it is but it doesn't fit my description of anything'. DO NOT FORGET TO CARRY YOUR CHARGER AROUND WITH YOU. Be careful in inserting and removing the SIM-plus-microSD holder. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars.
