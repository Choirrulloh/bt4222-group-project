Connectivity: 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, microUSB 2.0, 3.5mm audio jack. Processor: 1.1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 Quad-Core. Homegrown cell phone company Micromax yesterday unveiled the Micromax Spark Vdeo Q415 smartphone in India. Priced at Rs 4,499, it is the latest addition to company’s affordable lineup of Android-based smartphones. As far specifications of the phone are concerned, it offer a 4.5-inch IPS display with 854 x 480 pixels FWVGA resolution. The device is powered by a 1.1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 quad-core chip, 1GB RAM, and 8GB built-in memory.. Furthermore, the Micromax Spark Vdeo Q415 houses a 5MP rear camera and a 2MP front camera. The dual-SIM handset runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box. Its thickness measures a 10mm whereas the battery is rated at merely 1800mAh. Weighing 140g, it is based on the set of connectivity options like 4G VoLTE , Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, microUSB 2.0, and a 3.5mm audio jack.. But again, at the cost of Rs 4,499, last year’s Panasonic P75 marginally outranks the likes of Micromax. It has bigger screen, more battery, and better camera. However, one cannot possibly expect everything to be exemplary at sub Rs 5,000 price tag. Last week, Micromax launched the Canvas Mega 2 Plus Q426+ in India at Rs 7,499. Not to forget, Micromax also has a press event scheduled for next week where it will unveil its upcoming flagship smartphone..
