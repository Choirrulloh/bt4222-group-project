I was pretty excited when I knew Nokia was back with a versatile OS so I couldn't wait to get my own Nokia 6. I own the TA 1003 and although there may be done phones out there with a better proveedor for a lower price, I am very happy with what Nokia got. The battery is just enough for me and lasts longer than the one in the Galaxy S7. The Dolby Atmos and stereo speakers are awesome. The only minor trouble I had until now are the notificaciÃ³n sounds: the iPhone won't change the type of sound although you choose another one or keep it silent, I'd like to think it is a bug from Android (in my last equipment the last Android update mixed up my contacts' phone numbers). I also wanna think I hace, again, an equipment for a while. Was this review helpful? Yes No. 3 out of 3 people found this review helpful. By PUNNOOSE V BENNY | 3 Jul 2017. Was this review helpful?

Esto también se puede leer en español.. Nokia 6 marks the return of an old friend. The Nokia 6 and Arte Black Limited Edition bring Android Nougat, a shiny aluminum design and the return of an iconic phone brand.. by February 26, 2017 8:31 AM PST. Nokia 6 brings smooth simplicity with a serving of Nougat. Nokia 6 is pure Android Nougat in a sleek aluminium body. Nokia 6 and 6 Arte Black Limited Edition specs 5.5-inch screen with 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution and Gorilla Glass 16-megapixel rear camera 8-megapixel front-facing camera Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor 3GB RAM, 32GB internal storage (Nokia 6) 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage (Nokia 6 Arte Black Limited Edition) microSD card clot (up to 128GB) Aluminum chassis Android 7.1.1 Nougat 3,000mAh battery Fingerprint sensor NFC. Nokia, the powerhouse phone brand that dominated the planet as the millennium turned, returned to Mobile World Congress today with two new phones, the Nokia 6 and the Nokia 6 Arte Black Limited Edition.. Nokia 6 brings smooth simplicity with a serving of Nougat. Running on Android (no, not Windows Phone), the phones are part of a comeback strategy to regain a footing in an industry that Nokia helped create. The resurrection comes not from Microsoft, which absorbed the original Nokia's phone business in 2014, but from HMD, a new company formed of former Nokia employees that licensed the Nokia name .. Also announced today were two midrange Android phones, the Nokia 5 and 3 , and a (very fun!) rebooted version of the classic Nokia 3310 .. It's exciting news for nostalgic fans, but put aside your hopes for classic Nokia features like a kooky keyboard or a battery that will last forever. No, the Nokia 6 and 6 Arte Black Limited Edition take a straightforward "black rectangle" phone design with features that we've seen before.. MWC 2017: All the gadgets announced so far. Still, that's not to say that the handsets are completely dull. The polished skin is carved from a single block of aluminum, HMD says. I'm not quite sure what the benefit is there, but the result is a pleasantly shiny and smooth design. Simplicity rules here, and there's nothing wrong with that. It even reminds me a bit of the not-so-old Lumia phones, which always were classy in their own right. You'll be able to get the Nokia 6 in two shades of black plus silver, blue and copper.. Feature-wise, they're almost the same except that the Nokia 6 Arte Black Limited Edition has more memory and storage, and a slightly glossier black finish. On both phones, the 5.5-inch display is full HD and covered by Gorilla Glass. Inside is a pure form of Android Nougat. That means no bloatware or special skins, both of which are welcome moves. HMD is pushing "immersive entertainment" as the most prominent features. You'll find a 16-megapixel camera, dual speakers and an amplifier with Dolby Atmos tech.. The Nokia 6 is already sold in China , but now it will be landing in other countries with a 229 euro price tag. That converts to $240, £195 or AU$315. The Nokia 6 Arte Black Limited Edition will sell for 299 euros, which converts to $315, £250 or AU$410. Nokia has not announced a release date or the specific markets for either phone..

Much has been said and written about how the once-loved by one and all smartphone brand Nokia was late in embracing Android. As the old adage goes, better late than never and Nokia made its comeback to the smartphone segment with the launch of Nokia 6. It is the first Android-powered device to come with Nokia branding. Nokia smartphones are being manufactured by Finnish company HMD Global. Nokia 6 is a well-constructed smartphone and it falls in the budget smartphone category as it is priced at Rs 14,999. The device offers decent specifications and will also receive an update for Android 8.0 Oreo, but will this help Nokia in regaining its market share? We try and find out. We reviewed the Nokia 6 to see where its stands in the overcrowded Indian smartphone market. Design and display Nokia 6 became the talk of the town and aroused considerable amount of interest since its global launch in January this year. The smartphone has garnered lot of appreciation for its design and we second that opinion. Nokia 6 is a sleek yet solid smartphone which flaunts a metal unibody. The device comes with round edges with antenna lines running across the top and bottom end of the phone. The smartphone has a slightly curved rear panel with matte finish which offers a firm grip to the user. The company has also added metal highlights to the device which further enhance the look and feel of the smartphone. The right side of the device houses the volume rockers and power button, while the left houses a SIM card slot. The top band has the 3.5mm audio jack and the bottom has the micro USB charging port and speakers. The rear of the device features a 16MP camera with LED flash placed in vertical position along with the Nokia logo in the centre. The front panel comes with a 5.5-inch full HD 2.5D curved glass display. The right corner of the display has an 8MP front facing camera placed next to the Nokia branding. The bottom has soft keys along with the pill shaped home button which also doubles up as a fingerprint sensor. Considering its price segment, Nokia 6 scores pretty well in the design segment. *Good build quality *Pure Android experience *Affordable price. Nokia 6 User Reviews & Rating.

Nokia is a Finnish mobile phone manufacturer that was dominant in the 1990s and early 2000s. The company was unable to compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung when touchscreen smartphones gained popularity, thus rapidly losing market share. Nokia's mobile unit was acquired by Microsoft, which renamed the company as Microsoft Mobile.. Cisco says most of 5G network gear’s ready. Cisco wants a bigger share of the mobile market by backing these alternative providers rather than by making radio access equipment itself. HMD brings back the Popular Nokia 8110 in 4G Avatar.

more ... more .... more ... more .... 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. by Corey Gaskin. Nokia - Nokia + Android - Android +. 4 Call Quality, Battery Life and Conclusion. Introduction Guess who’s back? Nokia’s back. Sorry if you were still guessing. As most of you likely know, HMD Global is the actual company behind Nokia’s hardware revival. After a fruitless absorption into Microsoft’s expanding hardware division, Nokia was bought back by former executives of the company in a complex deal which allows Android phones to be made under its namesake. You can read all about that in our coverage of Nokia’s licensing agreement, but suffice to say, we’re looking at one of the fruits of this agreement today – the Nokia 6. And a fine-looking fruit it is. Being the highest-end Android phone that Nokia’s produced to date, this is still a mid-range device , looking to re-make its name in the crowded field of value-stuffed competitors. Aside from good looks, Nokia promises a reliable and pure Android experience, with regular updates and zero clutter. for either $180 (Amazon version with ads) or $230, the specs and the design of the 6 seem ripe with potential. Does Nokia finally have a modern division contender? Or, is this phone's beauty only skin-deep? Let’s dive in and find out. Design Well, you shouldn’t be too surprised here; the Nokia 6 is a good-looking phone. Being a mid-range device, you won’t find a bezel-less design here, but a much classier look than most in this category. The 6 sports a precision-milled aluminum body melded with sculpted Corning Gorilla Glass. It’s actually quite reminiscent of past Windows phones, in that it blends the trademark boxy form factor with modern elements, such as the metal body, shiny chamfered aluminum edges, and of course, a thinner profile. In all black, the phone carries quite a classy and professional air about it that will make corporate BlackBerry and iPhone loyalists look twice. The face is clean; sensors are all hidden away, with the earpiece, selfie cam, fingerprint sensor, and haptic buttons being the only interruptions in the all black face. Oh, and of course, in the top right corner is the hardly visible, classic Nokia branding, in case you forgot. Turning the device over, you’ll see flashes of light sheening on the polished edges, and on the right side of the phone the power/lockscreen button with the volume rocker above it – both constructed of black metal with silver accents, like the phone itself. Placement is good, and the buttons are clicky on the metal frame, as well as being easy to get to when holding the phone with one hand. Finally, on the back you’re greeted with one more silver accent, which borders the oblong camera bump. The bump is slight, but of course, any bump at all will have the device resting on it when placed on a flat surface. The 6 comes in a variety of colors – Arte Black (a shiny limited edition), Matte Black, Tempered Blue, Silver, and Copper – and all of them are pretty good-looking. Nokia promises the 6 to be “life-proof,” and although we know it doesn’t mean literally, or even close to the level of the so-named protective cases, you would expect at least some level of splash resistance. We know it’s been a while since Nokia’s produced its own phones, but these days you can’t even begin to make the claim of “life-proof” without even broaching a level of waterproof. We certainly hope a miss like this isn’t made in their upcoming flagship, or even the second generation of the Nokia 6, if there is one. Display The 6 packs a 5.5-inch IPS display with full HD 1080p (1920 x 1080) resolution. Delivering a respectable 403 pixels per square inch, finer details are represented well. Watching full HD video on this screen is a great experience – especially with the dual speakers producing Dolby Atmos certified sound. Colors are reasonably accurate, albeit a bit on the colder side.. 6.06 x 2.98 x 0.33 inches. 154 x 75.8 x 8.4 mm. 5.89 x 2.85 x 0.32 inches. 149.7 x 72.5 x 8.05 mm. 5.65 x 2.81 x 0.33 inches. 143.4 x 71.4 x 8.48 mm. 5.91 x 2.91 x 0.38 inches. 150.2 x 74 x 9.7 mm. To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page.. Minimum brightness (nits) Lower is better. Contrast Higher is better. Color temperature (Kelvins). Delta E rgbcmy Lower is better. Delta E grayscale Lower is better. The CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set (area) of colors that a display can reproduce, with the sRGB colorspace (the highlighted triangle) serving as reference. The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x: CIE31' and 'y: CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software.. The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance (balance between red, green and blue) across different levels of grey (from dark to bright). The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones, the better.. These measurements are made using SpectraCal's CalMAN calibration software..

The score is whatever you deem it to be. Besides, if you haven't actually used the device, how can you give it a score?. posted on 07 Aug 2017, 09:45. And would you care to elaborate why?. (Posts: 5787; Member since: 16 Mar 2013). posted on 07 Aug 2017, 10:54. They gave the Moto G5 a score of 7, yet they give this one a score of 8. Why did PhoneArena give it a 7 when the the Nokia 6 wasn't even out, yet. The Moto G5 has more features, better software upgrades. Same processors, same resolution display only the G5 display is physically smaller and brighter. The G5 has a removable battery. The finger print scanner is faster and does more on the G5 as well..

(Posts: 535; Member since: 20 Nov 2014). posted on 07 Aug 2017, 11:40. when they give a better phone redmi note 4. ( better battery, more ram and memory, better processor at the same price ) a lower score, it doesn't feel right. not only redmi note 4, but other phone that gets lower than 8 but seems to be a better deal at their own rice range. but again, thia is my opinion, you can have different opinion from mine.... (Posts: 386; Member since: 21 Jan 2016). posted on 07 Aug 2017, 13:49. The wireless radio on the Nokia 6 is utter garbage. Using it as a phone is an exercise in futility. Everything else about the phone is beautiful. I just can't get past that part. I'd probably give the thing a 6.5 for that reason alone.. (Posts: 13; Member since: 03 Feb 2017). posted on 08 Aug 2017, 04:57. in response to #14 Hide. I've had my 6 since last Fri and using it as a phone is really good - perhaps your one is faulty?

Hope other writers can learn this review (but I guess that score 8 was a bit high IMO), unlike some only know keep biased, or given an unfair score at least 9.2.

"Fingerprint authentication requires two taps, one to wake up and one to authenticate". The article states 'two taps' - you don't tap it you just hold your finger on until it opens the screen. Mine does not need two touches - just one and it's reliable. Was the phone on test a pre-production model perhaps?. (Posts: 1; Member since: 07 Aug 2017). posted on 07 Aug 2017, 11:51. The 2 tap unlock is actually because their unit is an Amazon exclusive with ads. I've seen the same behavior on the amazon ads Moto G5, what would be the point if with fingerprint unlock you could bypass the ads? So they force the user to see the lockscreen (The first tap actually unlocks the device, afert that you can tap again or swipe to unlock).

The Good The Nokia 6's slick metal jacket looks great, givin this affordable phone the lustre of a more premium handset.. The Bad The underpowered processor makes the phone sometimes frustrating to use.. The Bottom Line The sluggish performance of the Nokia 6 is a nuisance, but its low price and good looks go a long way to make up for it.. Of the three phones Nokia launched earlier this year (The Nokia 3 , 5 and 6), the Nokia 6 ( $229.00 at Amazon.com ) is the star. But at only £220 (or $180 in the US, with Amazon's ads appearing on the lockscreen), it's still affordable.. It uses premium metals to look slick and premium but keeps the price down with a low-end processor and a display with a ho-hum resolution. As such, performance can be laggy, but it's not a huge problem for everyday use.. Don't buy this phone if you're looking for the best example of what a smartphone can be. Instead, consider it if you want a great-looking Android phone that'll handle your life's essentials and won't drain your wallet.. The all-metal design is where this phone really stands out. It has an aesthetic that you wouldn't feel embarrassed to whip out in a posh cocktail bar. It's an incredibly smart-looking handset with machine-milled edges that give it a polished metal accent which looks great on the deep blue hue of my review model. It feels extremely premium to hold too, thanks to that solid body that has none of the flimsy feeling flex you find in many lower-end phones.. My major annoyance about the design is that the edges are quite sharp, which can make the phone uncomfortable to hold. It's something that my colleague Rick Broida also found when he used the Nokia 6 for a week in place of his much more expensive iPhone 6S Plus .. I'm also disappointed it lacks USB-C charging, with the 6 opting for the older micro-USB standard. It's not a deal-breaker, particularly given the low price, but with most phones launching now sporting USB-C, it would have been good to see that here. There's no waterproofing, either -- though again, I can't really hold that against it at this cheap price. be careful around the pool or when your clumsy friend is reaching for their drink.. The 5.5-inch display is large enough to do justice to vibrant mobile games and YouTube clips. Its full HD resolution (1,920x1,080-pixels) is lower than you'll find on premium phones like the Galaxy S8 ( $597.42 at Amazon.com ) , but it's more than adequate for your everyday Twitter and Instagram needs and totally acceptable given the phone's much lower price. Sure, if you hold both phones side-by-side you might notice a touch less clarity on high-res photos on the Nokia, but this isn't a very likely scenario.. The octa-core processor is where the phone starts to fall down. Simply swiping around the Android interface is reasonably nippy, but opening the camera takes longer than I'd like and HDR photos take several seconds to save. Apps can be a bit sluggish to open, too, although I didn't find any performance problems when using the apps. I could quickly tweak photos in Snapseed, for example, and games like Sonic and NOVA: Legacy played perfectly well enough to keep you entertained on your commute.. Best Phones for 2018. See All. Samsung’s king of phones is excellent, but you'll pay a pretty penny for stylus privileges.. A radical redesign that's nearly all screen includes a new cutting-edge facial recognition....

Press enter or click on the search icon. Software, battery life, camera and verdict. Sitting atop the initial batch of Nokia phones made by HMD – the company now responsible for producing smartphones using the famous Finnish brand name – the Nokia 6 should be the most enticing of the bunch. It’s an affordable device; with a big Full HD screen, stock Android software and a classic Nokia design.. Yet, and this seems to be on ongoing problem with these new Nokia branded phones, it feels that corners have been cut in all the wrong places.. When Nokia was designing phones running Windows Phone, I longed for one that ditched that awful operating system for Android. Nokia was at the top of its game when it came to industrial design, but it was always let down by software.. Yet now that there are Nokia branded phones running Android, I just feel a bit disappointed. The Nokia 6 isn’t a bad looking phone, it just feels like it’s been plucked straight from 2014.. It’s a bulky device, with sharp flat corners and a slightly domed plastic back. The large bezel around the 5.5-inch display makes for a big phone, and the lack of any curvature on the sides make it quite hard to comfortably hold without it digging into your palms. There is plentiful use of metal, especially for a phone of this price, but the back is plastic and as a result it feels quite hollow.. It’s a shame about the ergonomics of the phone, because it does actually look quite nice. My black review unit is simple and free of ugly branding, with a fast fingerprint scanner flanked by two capacitive buttons below the display. Thankfully they’re backlit, something that was missing on the cheaper Nokia 3. It looks like a Nokia phone, though maybe one that could do with a bit of modern flair... The 5.5-inch LCD display Nokia uses has a Full HD (1080 x 1920) resolution, which is a prerequisite for a panel of that size but one that’s not necessarily guaranteed when you’re paying less than £200. It’s a nice, bright, big screen that makes the Nokia 6 a decent choice for watching movies on the go.. Unlike the Nokia 3, which struggled with colour reproduction, the panel on the Nokia 6 is heaps better.. Colours are nice and bright, while text is crisp and sharp. It lacks the deep blacks you’d get with an AMOLED, frequently found on high-end Samsung phones, but it certainly is one of the better screens you’ll find at this price.. Budget phones undoubtedly have to cut back in certain areas to keep the costs down, and Nokia has skimped in the worst possible way. The Nokia 3 was dogged by terrible performance, and the Nokia 6 is hamstrung in a similar way.. Get news, competitions and special offers direct to your inbox.

The Snapdragon 430 CPU and Adreno 505 GPU used here has already been updated to the 435, which is used in the cheaper Vodafone Smart V8 , and it simply cannot keep up with the big 1080p display.. Lag is common and constant, mostly in infuriating instances such as scrolling through websites and image-heavy apps like Instagram. It’s the sort of day-to-day performance I wouldn’t accept on a sub-£150 phone, let alone one that costs £200.. Gaming is a similar story, and that basic GPU means intensive titles are slow and full of dropped frames. It is possible to load Real Racing 3 and Injustice 2, which is something, but it’s a much better experience if you stick to simpler titles.. It seems that Nokia should have either lowered the screen resolution or gone with a processor from the Snapdragon 6-series range, which is more suited to a 5.5-inch 1080p phone. This would have raised the price, but it would have made a big difference.. In Trusted ’s synthetic benchmark tests, the Nokia 6’s rather low single-core score of 600 in Geekbench shows why basic tasks are so slow.. There’s 3GB RAM on board, which sounds plentiful, but in reality there seems to be some heavy RAM management going on that makes it feel like there’s much less. Apps close constantly and they’ll need reloading even if you’ve only opened a few more.. The 32GB on-board storage is more appealing, and there’s a microSD slot for expanding that further.. The speaker sits on the bottom, next to the Micro USB port, and as a result can get easily blocked when you’re holding it landscape while watching a video. A Dolby mode suggests that turning it on will see a boost in audio quality, but in reality it seems to lower the maximum volume and not make much obvious difference elsewhere.. Call quality and Wi-Fi performance are okay, but the lack of any noise-cancellation – that I can perceive – on the microphones does make for blustery calls when you’re outside..

Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Hardware Features: Autofocus (Laser, Phase detection). Software Features: Touch to focus, Face detection, Self-timer, Digital zoom, Geo tagging. Settings: Exposure compensation, ISO control, White balance presets.

Octa-core, 1400 MHz, ARM Cortex-A53, 64-bit. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 18.00 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 32.0 days (768 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life.

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. Premium affordability from an iconic name. The Nokia 6 is comfortably the most accomplished of the launch trio of new Nokia phones. If you can stretch to the quite reasonable price tag it’s the Nokia phone we’d recommend you go for thanks to its Full HD display, tidy performance and solid camera.. Solid camera great for social snaps. Not the most comfortable in hand. Battery life gives a day at best. Nokia 6 price and availability Launch price: £199.99 ($229, AU$399) Current price: £199.99 ($229, AU$399) Nokia 6 release date was August 2, 2017 in both the US and UK Design and display Premium all-metal unibody design looks and feels impressive Flat edges means it's not the most comfortable in the hand 5.5-inch full HD screen looks good and is great for gaming. The once-iconic phone brand is back in business thanks to Finnish startup HMD signing a 10-year licensing deal to stick the Nokia name on smartphones and tablets, and the Nokia 6 is the main attraction in its trio of launch devices.. While the Nokia 6 was the most high-spec handset at its launch, it’s still firmly a budget offering, with an eye-catchingly low price tag coupled with an alluring all-metal design.. The phone boasts a 5.5-inch Full HD display, Snapdragon 430 chipset, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, 16MP rear camera, 8MP front camera, fingerprint scanner and a 3,000mAh battery – all of which looks rather good on paper.. For those looking for a more flagship handset sporting the Nokia name, there's the Nokia 8. It's also worth noting there's a new version of the Nokia 6 in China, but it's not currently available in the west.. Performance upgrades include extra RAM and an improved chipset, so it may be worth waiting until the new version of the Nokia 6 launches if it comes to the US, UK or Australia soon.. The Nokia 6 costs £199.99 ($229, AU$399) SIM-free, which drops it into a rather affordable category in the market, and looking at the spec sheet it gives you a decent amount of bang for your buck.. That price puts it above both the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 , but not by much, and it's worth considering this phone as well if you're looking at the other two.. In the US it’s available in three colors – copper, black and silver – while in the UK you get an additional blue option. Those in Australia can only buy the black and silver versions, which is a bit of a shame for those looking for a bold shade.. The Nokia 6 is crafted from a single block of aluminum, and the result is a phone which feels far more premium than its budget price tag.. It doesn’t do anything particularly clever or different in terms of design, though, with elements of older Nokia smartphones recognisable here.. There’s a comforting weight to the handset, and while its 154 x 75.8 x 7.85mm body makes it a sizeable presence in the hand it’s still easy to use.. We found the flat sides and sharp corners of the Nokia 6 aren’t as comfortable on the palms as phones with rounded edges – like the Nokia 5 and 3 – and this is noticeable if you hold it in one hand for an extended period of time.. Compared to the Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus , two of its closest rivals, the Nokia 6 is much better looking, so if style is important to you then this is a phone you’ll want to consider.. The power/lock and volume keys are easy to hit on the right of the phone, and Nokia has also included a 3.5mm headphone jack up top, while a micro USB port resides next to a single internal speaker on the base of the handset.. Considering the price of the phone, it’s nice to see a fingerprint scanner (which doubles as the home key) on the front of the Nokia 6, flanked by touch-sensitive back and multi-tasking keys. The scanner is responsive and works well, although there is a momentary pause between you presenting your finger and the phone unlocking and waking.. Meanwhile, the large 5.5-inch full HD display is bright and clear with decent viewing angles, and it’s more than good enough for a handset in the bracket the Nokia 6 falls into.. It means video playback and gaming are comfortable, with plenty of space for on-screen controls.. Next Page Battery life and camera.

Shop a personalized selection of daily deals right from the home screen using the Amazon Widget.. An unlocked phone is a device that is not bound to any carrier or plan. It allows you to choose your phone first and your carrier second. Upon selecting a plan, simply insert the carrier's SIM card into the phone and you're ready to go. If you decide you want to change carriers down the road or want to take an international trip, it's as simple as replacing your existing SIM card with a new SIM and activating your new plan.. What are the benefits of an unlocked phone?. Freedom: Choose the carrier with the best service or price. If you find a better deal later, you have the ability to change to a different carrier.. Travel: Take your phone internationally and use the carrier of your choice. It's as easy as inserting an active SIM card.. Selection: Choose the phone with the features you want, whether or not your carrier sells it, and get more service options without a contract.. How do I set up my unlocked phone?. The first thing you’ll need is a SIM card for your desired carrier. When activated, the SIM card will let your phone connect to your carrier’s network. If you decide to upgrade to a newer unlocked phone in the future, you can easily remove the SIM card from your old phone and put it in your new phone—just make sure you get the right size of SIM card (nano, micro, or standard) for your phone. If you want to use your phone while traveling internationally, you can easily buy a SIM card for a carrier that operates where you’re traveling. As long as it’s activated, you can just swap SIM cards when you arrive at your destination.. 2.98 x 6.06 x 0.31 in. 2.73 x 0.32 x 5.61 in. 3.07 x 0.33 x 6.09 in. 2.83 x 0.31 x 5.86 in. 2.83 x 0.31 x 5.86 in. 0.31 x 5.84 x 2.89 in.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars A feature by feature break down.. Offer Type: Standard Version | Color: Black | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. I am going to step you through each aspect of the phone and my thoughts so far. Short Version Pro's - Price is seems very low for what you get. - Battery life is shockingly good. (ha) - Phone feels amazing in the hand, the one piece of aluminum shell can't be beat - Durability of this thing is on point, designed to last instead of break. - Speaker sounds great and achieves good volume. - Bare bones android, the dream. - Comprehensive antenna set for travel. Con's - No usb C connector, uses the more common micro usb. - Stock camera software is extremely basic, enough for most users but weak for those looking for those great shots. - Processor can get a little hung up every once and a while but it's barely noticeable. - Phone feels so nice that putting a case on it just feels bad encouraging you not to protect it and you should always use protection. - It doesn't make me breakfast. Feel and buttons: The phone feels extremely high quality, it's the only phone that I really hate having a case on because the aluminum feels so nice. The power and volume buttons are also aluminum and very solid, there have been complaints about them being hard to press, they aren't, they are just stiff enough that you won't easily accidentally press them like all other phones. Touch screen and fingerprint sensor: The screen felt a little off to me and it doesn't register touch perfectly but it's on par with other flag ship phones I've owned and I am still just getting use to it. The finger print sensor on this phone is amazing, it is covered with durable glass and reads finger prints very well. If you have issues with it re-enter your print, when I did it worked great. Battery: Holy crap, I've never, ever, had a phone that lasts like this one with the stock battery, my previous phone had an extended battery that more then doubled it's capacity and this phone doesn't drain much faster then it did. Charges reasonably quick and doesn't turn into a fire brick while charging and doing tasks. Camera: Ok, so my last phone had an amazing manual mode with full shudder speed controls and the works. This one comes with a stock android camera app that is pretty weak for features and merely ok at capturing good shots. Apps like open camera help resolve this but it's a little bit buggy on this phone, especially when trying to control shudder speed. I can't speak a lot to the selfie camera because I don't really use them. Speaker: How does something this cheap have speakers this good? I don't have an answer, I'm just really happy it does. It's not super loud, it reaches about average volume, but does it with rich sound for a phone. Software: Stock android, no bloat other then the amazon apps but who isn't using prime? The ads are very easy to ignore and I'll gladly ignore an ad for 50 dollars, I honestly don't even notice them. Antenna's/Travel: One of the reasons I purchased this phone is because I am spending some time in Europe and it has, by far, the most comprehensive LTE antenna setup for the cost. I searched forever trying to find a phone with the 3,7,20 bands for Europe, I was struggling to find flag ship phones that had it and here it is on a entry level. Durability: The Youtuber JerryRigEverything said this may be his pick for most durable phone of 2017. I could have guessed that when it arrived. If you look closely at the phone you can see the spacer built between the screen and the outer edge of the phone, creating a bumper to help protect it. A thin rubber case is enough to make this phone very unlikely to be damaged. Even if you fall victim to the the very satisfying feel of this phone without a case you'd have to give it a pretty harsh drop to crack it. If I think of anything else I'll edit the review later, if you have questions comment on this review and I'll try to address them. Finding the right phone to fit your situation can be tough but I believe this particular phone can fit nicely into most peoples situations.. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Nokia 6 Silver add-less version. Offer Type: Standard Version | Color: Copper | Offer Type: Phone Only | Verified Purchase. Update 7/14/17: The issues I was experiencing on 7/12 were resolved after doing a master reset of the device. The Nokia Launcher3 that runs the homescreen was corrupt after the 7.1.1 update. Now all of my widgets in the widget drawer are there and after restarting the phone continue to be available. I think the network issue was also caused by an outdated carrier setting file that was redownloaded after the factory wipe. The phone is now performing flawlessly and is a really great piece of hardware. I don't have any screen coloring issues like a couple other reviewers have had and the processor seems to be keeping up just fine for my lite daily usage. I'm not a heavy gamer but I could see graphic intensive games possibly slowing the processor. I'll download some games to play and see what happens. Bumping my overall score back up to a 5 since my issues have been resolved. Update 7/12/17: I received the push update to 7.1.1 yesterday. I like how quickly Nokia/HMD is pushing updates to these devices compared to other manufacturers. But I'm now running into my first issue. The default Nokia clock widget has disappeared as well as the google now search widget. I cannot for the life of me get these back. I downloaded another clock widget and after restarting the app is still in the app drawer but the widget as also disappeared and is nowhere to be found in the widget drawer. Issue #2 today: I get to work after having no issues getting on to AT&T LTE and today it is only connecting to AT&T H+ (4G lite) after restarting still only connecting to that network. Will most likely be doing a master wipe when I get home and see if that resolves my issues. If not I'll be contacting Amazon for a replacement. Fingers crossed it just needs a software wipe. If anyone else is experiencing same issues please comment! I'm dropping my review by 1 star until this is resolved. I received my Nokia 6 yesterday on launch day. I purchased the silver without adds for $229. Initial impressions are the phone is gorgeous and build quality is excellent. Reminds me of the quality of my Nokia E71 of years past. The screen is almost bezelless on the sides which is nice. The colors and pixel density are excellent. The stock android is a welcome experience and is very snappy and responsive. I read where people were concerned with the 430 processor Nokia decided to use in this device and so far it seems like it will keep up just fine with my needs. One thing I found interesting is even this US version can be dual SIM which is rare to have in our country. It has a nano SIM slot and a combo micro SD or another nano SIM can be placed in the tray. This is a nice feature if you are wanting to combine maybe your business and personal phone but want to keep separate numbers. Camera seems fine but I haven't had much experience yet using it outdoors so I may update the review after further testing. Overall I can't believe something that is priced sub $250 can have this quality and feel. I remember phones of this price range a few years ago feeling like they came out of a cracker Jack box. If you're looking for something new I'd give this one a shot especially since it's sold via Amazon so shipping will be quick and returns I'd necessary easy.. Was this review helpful to you?. This is the best 200$ phone around period. You want that bare-bones android experience? This is it and its got great construction and quality. 5.0 out of 5 stars This is the best 200$ phone around period. The worse phone I ever had no good the already stopped working. 1.0 out of 5 stars Don't buy this phone you will regret it. When I got the phone, it automatically updated to Android 8.0.0. My problem is that it kills music player apps while they are playing, when the phone has been otherwise... 1.0 out of 5 stars Kills music players while they are playing, after minutes or hours of play. I love this phone! I've had it for 6 months now through rain, heat, snow and gravity during which it's held up like a tank. 5.0 out of 5 stars A Tank of a Phone. 4.0 out of 5 stars Four Stars. 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent specs at a very good price. To put it plain and simple, the WiFi antenna in this phone does not pick up my home wifi signal (or any signal nearby). For a phone that is supposed to work in the U.S. 1.0 out of 5 stars Beware Of Malfunctioning WiFi antenna. 5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars. What you spend is what you get. I was very optimistic about Nokia Comeback and Bought this phone. I had oneplus1 and oneplus2 earlier - No complains on them. 3.0 out of 5 stars Donot buy if you donot want a slow phone. Nokia claims it's a known issue and will be fixed in an update in the near future... 1.0 out of 5 stars Nokia is not Nokia anymore.. What other items do customers buy after viewing this item?.

The brand that was once the leader in the Indian mobile phone market is back again with its all new Nokia 6. The Nokia 6 is an Android based smartphone. The Nokia 6 is designed by HMD Global, and it is manufactured by Foxconn Technology, which also happens to be the manufacturer of Apple’s iPhone.. The Nokia 6 undoubtedly reminds of the design philosophy of all the mobile phones devices from Nokia back in the day, especially the glossy rectangular block around the primary camera. The device comes with a fingerprint scanner that sits below the display along with two capacitive physical navigational buttons. On the back of the device is the Nokia branding along with the camera module and a LED flash. The device measures 154 x 75.8 x 7.85 mm and it is only available in black colour variant.. The Nokia 6 has a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS LCD display. The display is covered by a 2.5D glass and also protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3. The Full HD (1920x1080) resolution gives the display a pixel density of 403 PPI. Nokia also promises that the display will deliver 450 nits of brightness at its maximum level. The Nokia 6 is equipped with a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera; it is accompanied by an LED flash and a phase-detection autofocus system. The secondary camera is an 8-megapixel unit with a wide-angle lens. Both the cameras can record videos at Full HD resolution. The camera experts have always praised the smartphones from Nokia for their imaging capabilities as Nokia optimises the camera software very well.. The Nokia 6 encloses a 3,000 mAh non-removable battery. It is still unconfirmed whether the device supports fast charging or not. Sadly, Nokia has skipped the USB Type-C and went the widely used microUSB 2.0 for wired connectivity. The wireless connectivity includes dual-SIM 4G LTE, Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, and GPS.. The Nokia 6 comes pre-loaded with Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system. Nokia has customised the Android OS to give it a different look. The software customisations include different icon sets and a different system-wide theme. Also, Nokia has removed the application drawer; many Chinese phone manufacturers tend to do the same. Under the hood, the Nokia 6 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 chipset. The chipset consists of an octa-core Cortex-A53 CPU along with Adreno 505 GPU. The chipset is mated to 3GB of LPDDR3 RAM. Nokia was generous enough to provide the device with 32GB of internal storage that can also be expanded up to 128GB via a microSD card.. Nokia 6 Specifications Display Display Type IPS LCD Resolution 1080x1920 pixels Size (in inches) 5.5 Pixel Density 403 pixels per inch (ppi) Touchscreen type Capacitive Color Reproduction 16M Colors Protection Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Screen to body percentage 70.7 % Design and Build Dimensions 6.0 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches Weight 169 grams Software Operating System Android OS, v7.1.1 (Nougat) Camera Rear Flash Yes, Dual LED Selfie Flash No Primary 16 M.Pixels Front 8 M.Pixels Video Yes Storage Internal 32GB RAM 3GB Expandable MicroSD, 128GB Battery Type Li-Ion Talk time 18 hrs (3G) Capacity 3000 mAh Standby Time 768 hrs (3G) Turbo Charge Yes Connectivity Bluetooth v4.2 Wi-Fi Yes with hotspot 3G Yes USB Micro USB v2.0 Voice Over LTE (VoLTE) No 2G Yes 4G Yes SIM Configuration Dual SIM (Nano SIM) GPS Yes NFC Chipset Yes Infrared No Processor Variant Snapdragon 430 Architecture Cortex-A53 No of Cores 8 (Octa Core) Frequency 1.4 GHz Make Qualcomm MSM8937 GPU Adreno 505 Sensors Proximity Yes Accelerometer Yes Gyroscope Yes Ambient Light Yes Fingerprint sensor Yes Sound Loudspeaker Yes Headphones Yes. Please ask the question in above box. Which one is better Nokia 6 and Oppo A57?. Nokia 6 is way better than the Oppo A57 in every aspect. The design of the Nokia 6 feels premium and runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat out-of-the-box. The 16MP camera at the back with dual-tone dual LED flash will let you capture crisp images in bright daylight. Unfortunately, it records only 1080p HD video, that too at 30fps. That's because the Snapdragon 430 chipset running inside can't support 4K. The 8MP selfie camera is good enough. Nokia has added active noise cancellation for the mics for clear voice over calls. Also, the phone pegs Dolby Atmos enhancement, but we don't recommend holding your breath on it. The phone offers a 5.5 inch FHD screen protected with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass. Nokia is the best phone in India.. What is the difference between Oppo F3 and Nokia 6?. Oppo has different (good) features than Nokia. Ex: For taking a screenshot in Oppo, swipe with three fingers from top to bottom. Then you will get the screenshot, but for Nokia, you have to press the volume button and the power button to take a screenshot.. What is the difference between LCD and Super AMOLED display?. AMOLED (Active Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode) is on the other hand an improvement over OLED. AMOLED technology relies on the concept of lighting up pixels individually on top of a TFT array which passes current through organic compounds. AMOLED also provides better viewing angles than IPS LCD. What are the best features of this mobile?. Android Nougat 7.1.1, 1080p HD video, 3GB to 4GB RAM, Back camera=16MP with aperture f/2.0 and 1.0um pixel size, Front Camera= 8MP, f/2.0,1.12um pixel size, face detection, dual LED flash, Dolby Atom Sound, Fingerprint, Fast Battery Charging, 3000mAh Battery, Octa-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53, Corning Gorilla Glass 3, size=5.5 inches etc.. It's good to handle and it looks very attractive.. The full form is Long Term Evolution. It benefits us in terms of faster uploading and downloading as compared to 3G.. 84 Ratings 32 Reviews. 5 50. 4 15. 3 7. 2 2. 1 10. Rate & review this product and help other customers.

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. The Nokia 6 is a good enough device for a lot of people, but not for everyone. Itâs a pity there are few misses here and there that makes it stop short of being an overall well-rounded package that one wouldâve liked it to be.. Expandable up to 128 GB with microSD card. Cameras Rear: 16 MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, dual-LED flash. Front: 8 MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture. Dimensions and weight 154 x 75.8 x 7.9 mm. Before HMD Global unveiled the Nokia 8 , theÂ. Nokia 6 was the highest specâd smartphone from the company, a company which describes itself as a startup but that carries the strong legacy of the Nokia brand. It was one of the three Nokia-branded Android smartphones (along with the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5) first launched by the company.. The Nokia 6 is essentially a mid-range smartphone that aims to offer a great Android experience instead of competing on the specifications sheet. Since it was first unveiled at MWC 2017 in February – but only went on sale only in the second half of the year – the innards are a tad dated compared to what else is on the shelves at the moment.. Does the Nokia 6 deliver on its promise of a capable mid-ranger with a pure and up-to-date Android experience? Letâs find out!. Letâs get this out of the way: the Nokia 6 looks brilliant. It’s probably the best-looking Android smartphone in its price rangeâ standing out in a sea of similar-looking smartphones. The design elements are even reminiscent of some devices in the Lumia portfolio from the Nokia of old.. It looks blocky since the edges are tapered, rather than curved. At 7.85 mm and weighing 169 grams, itâs not the slimmest or lightest phone out there, yet it looks very premium and feels solid when you hold it in your hand. Milled from a single piece of 6000 series aluminum, the Nokia 6 feels like it is built to last.. At the back, thereâs the familiar vertical Nokia branding. The matte finish looks slick, and the smartphone doesnât pick up fingerprints easily. The camera is placed in a chrome housing, and it protrudes slightly from the body. It doesnât look bad, but it does make the phone wobble when placed on a flat surface.. Overall, the Nokia 6 looks like a very premium smartphone with a build quality that gives you confidence it can withstand the rigors of everyday use.. The 5.5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS LCD display on the Nokia 6 adds to the smartphoneâs premium look and feel. Thereâs 2.5D curved glass on top with Corning Gorilla Glass protection.. Thereâs also a polarizer layer on the display that works like a filter to reduce the glare and reflections from the glass while improving the sunlight legibility. Even in harsh sunlight, brightness is adequate though and thereâs no problem in using the phone outdoors.. The display offers decent brightness generally, and the color reproduction is great. The images and text look crisp, but the contrast is somewhat lower than I wouldâve liked. The viewing angles are just fine though.. The Nokia 6 has a modest specifications sheet, especially compared to other smartphones in its price segment â and some in an evenÂ. The Snapdragon 430 processor isnât a workhorse, but it’s no slouch either. 3 GB RAM is good enough for most people, and the Nokia 6 powers through everyday tasks without slacking. In most cases, the Nokia 6 actually fared better than other phones powered by the Snapdragon 430 chipset.. However, if you push it a little, the phone’s limitations are apparent. Thereâs some lag while switching between apps when multitasking extensively. That said, the gaming performance is all okay and thereâs no stutter while playing graphics-intensive games. They do take a few seconds extra to launch, though.. Thereâs 32 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 128 GB using a microSD card. That should work for most people, unless you are a multimedia hoarder and need a device with 64 GB of storage on-board.. The Nokia 6 packs in a unremarkable 3,000 mAh battery â I didnât expect any special endurance from it, but the smartphone can easily last a full day and then some. The only downside here is that thereâs no fast-charging, and the phone takes over two hours to go from zero to 100% battery.. The Nokia 6 sports Dolby Atmos sound enhancement that offers loud and clear audio. The difference is quite apparent if you turn it on or off and it’s actually pretty impressive.. One critical yet often ignored area where the Nokia 6 excels is latching on to cellular networks. Even in weak spots where some other phones struggled, the Nokia 6 would keep the network bars lit up.. The home button on the front doubles up as a fingerprint scanner as well. While the fingerprint authentication works flawlessly, it is awkwardly placed towards the very bottom edge of the phone. Itâs not a deal breaker, but it takes some time to get used to.. The Nokia 6 includes a hybrid tray, so you can either use two Nano SIMs, or one SIM and a microSD card. It uses micro-USB for charging instead of the new USB-C type port, which is a tad disappointing.. The Nokia 6 sports a 16 MP rear camera with 1.0Âµm pixel size and f/2.0 aperture, along with dual LED flash. As expected, it manages to take good photos in daylight with a high level of detail. The contrast is great, and the photos come out sharp. But the colors lack punch and are more muted than what I would have liked.. In low light conditions, the details suffer and the experience is below-par. In the absence of a light source, some of the shots would just come out black.. With the phase-detection autofocus, the camera is quick to lock focus though it takes a while for images to be captured and saved. The 8 MP front-facing camera does a good job with selfies in good lighting conditions, but not so great in low light.. HDR mode is pretty dramatic and inconsistent, and photos take a while to process. The Panorma mode though is pretty good. The details are great, and stitching is flawless in most cases.. While the camera app is pretty basic, there are handy features like a level and a compass, along with a Manual mode that lets you configure metering mode, white balance, exposure, and so on.. The Nokia 6 records video at 1080p/30fps. Itâs nothing exceptional, but the videos manage to capture pleasant contrast and vivid colors, which is a little odd considering colors in photos can be muted.. Overall, the Nokia 6 has a decent camera, but certainly not the best in the business in its price segment. My primary issue with the camera was the inconsistency in performance. As a Nokia offering, I was hoping for a better imaging experience. That said, the software updates during my experience with the device have definitely enhanced the camera performance.. In its grand comeback, Nokiaâs primary pitch focused on âpure and up-to-dateâ Android. Nougat out of the box, the company promises regular and timely Android updates. And it looks like HMD Global is not slacking off, with updates coming through during my review period. The company has also promised the Android Oreo update for the entire Nokia lineup.. One note for the purists: there are custom icons on board. There are also a few pre-loaded apps such as Amazon and the entire suite of Google apps, including Photos, which is the default app for photos on Nokia 6. The phone allows you to perform actions with supported apps by simply long-pressing the icons for launcher shortcuts. As in Android Nougat, thereâs a split-screen mode, although the two simultaneous apps can only open as two equal halves only, without the option to resize them.. The Nokia 6 is a good enough device for a lot of people, but not for everyone.. The Nokia 6 is a conflicting device. Thereâs a lot to like about it, especially its premium design and solid build quality, but itâs only an average performer. It feels underpowered, especially for what many power users would expect. For those, there are better performing smartphones in the market available in the same price segment.. The camera is unfortunately pretty inconsistent too. I liked it initially, but some of the sample shots were disappointing.. At â¹14,999 ($231) in India, the Nokia 6 is a tad expensive for the internal components it packs. But the stylish and durable chassis with stock Android could be just fine for a lot of people, especially those that aren’t too fussed on high performance and premium photography. Itâs a pity there are few misses here and there that keep this device from being the overall well-rounded package that one wouldâve liked it to be.. HMD Global , Nokia , Nokia 6.

Nokia 6 - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 … 399 400 ». As for the people who want to use the phone in extreme temperatures , first of all it's mid range phone so resistance to water is out of the question 2nd is that every phone has it's own speciality like why did you go for Nokia 6 which recently came to market and answer to that is build quality,long lasting. I'm not suggesting to go for Nokia because there are phones with good screen or battery or resistance to water so to each their own. Anonymous, 24 Feb 2018 Hi, did your loudspeaker stopped working all of a sudden and started working again after an up... more Actually I was using the phone too much like 3 hrs nonstop WiFi or movies, games so that was the reason my phone use to get hanged and the speakers would not ring nor make a sound. I have to restart the phone and after that it would work. At beginning every thing was fine but I think it started after October or November update but now it neither gets heated nor hangs and I won't update it further than January 2018 Oreo because for my ta 1003 it is the best. I would suggest you to update your phone until it satisfy you not more than that. Habib wardak, 24 Feb 2018 I had problems with my Nokia 6 ta 1003 like heating issues and sometimes the loud speaker woul... more Hi, did your loudspeaker stopped working all of a sudden and started working again after an update?. My loudspeaker stopped working 2 days after oreo update. If it's a software issue and can be fixed by update I don't want to waste time in service centre. Several people have this issue in the Nokia support forums. Hoping Nokia would fix this soon.. I had problems with my Nokia 6 ta 1003 like heating issues and sometimes the loud speaker would hang but I waited because hmd promised Oreo and another reason was my phone wasn't made to be used outside China but now it's perfect. I only upgraded to Oreo and all the problems were solved. These kinds of issues can be solved over the period of time and I know hmd is not perfect but still they are trying.. Hani, 17 Feb 2018 Nokia 6 2017 ... slow and lagging so much even Android 8 received !! sorry that I wasted money... more Dude, You can enter developer options and set your animation scale, that way your phone becomes smooth again. Mine was laggy too before but it is okay now.. I got an issue with my brand new N6 - the display doesn't function at a low temperature, under 5C. Contacting Nokia support, I wasted 1.5h of my life for no solution provided. - N6 phones are not operational in cold weather (close to 0 C). - There is no Nokia Care centers in Canada or Central America. If your phone is not working properly, you can just throw it away. - Support representatives are admitting they have no solutions. I've been literally told to do whatever I want with my cell phone. ,heats up easily& problem in mic. my score on this phone is 20/100..... you did poorly on this one. I buy note 4 same price an i install update custom Rom(android 7) and its ahead a mile far than nokia 6..... The King of all phones started roaring again. Features may look lesser like 430 Snapdragon against 625, 630, 650 in Chinese phones of the same range. 3000 MAH Battery against 4000 Mah in Chinese phones Etc but the quality of the hardware is better. Battery runs more due to perfect optimisation of Hardware and software. Quality of Camera is good, no hanging and heating during multitasking.. Anonymous, 20 Feb 2018 came on nokia....it's time to full screen display...like vivo and other brant in mid range My N6(2017) has _perfectly_ full screen. It also has several important controls and one important button all at their perfect locations.. Lone_wolf, 19 Feb 2018 Why every mobile company has made hybrid sim card slot rather than making 2 sim card slot and ... more The root cause is that Google is making direct and easy data transfer and syncing between PC and the phone more and more difficult, in the attempt to persuade people to start more willingly using the cloud services (clown services). So more information, pictures etc, can be collected from the users. First they took away the ability to connect the phone memory to a computer as a disk drive. Then came phones without no memory slot at all. These were/are not selling very well. Now we have this awkward combo, if you want to take the extSD out (to connect it to a PC) then you also are removing the SIM. To do this safely one has to power off the phone while the extSD (and the SIM) is out.. came on nokia....it's time to full screen display...like vivo and other brant in mid range. Somnath Nandy, 16 Feb 2018 Is this a chinese variant ? Those who bought in early 2017 got Chinese variant now it's global version and even 2018 variant available which includes bothie camera. Personally I got Chinese variant because I am a fan of Nokia and satisfied after Oreo update. Why every mobile company has made hybrid sim card slot rather than making 2 sim card slot and memory card slot separately? I would like to suggest to stop producing hybrid sim card slot. because we want to use both sim and required maximum storage too.. Been using this since 15 Dec 2017, already 3 months. Quite disappointed because the NFC reader didnt work as expected. I used Nexus 6 before and the NFC work perfectly with my various cards. Have any idea why the NFC didnt work?. Can someone guide me about this phone... Shall i buy it or not.... Aniket, 13 Feb 2018 Should I purchase nokia 6 or not ??? Yes buy it. Himzz, 17 Feb 2018 You can download it without WiFi. I did mine yesterday through mobile data. more Himzz, thank you very much for this information! I do not have courage try it yet since there are several rather worrisome major bug reports for v.8.0.0 e.g. here: https://community.phones.nokia.com/support/discu­ssions/forums/7000004252 (especially a lot of reports about the volume control messed up) and if it so happens that the update somehow gets going, e.g. by mistake, then there is no going back and I'd be stuck with majorly faulty OS in the phone (this is one huge problem in Android "ecosystem", with personal computers one has the choice to go to a previous OS version, however far back it is necessary). It is then the wording on the info/popup message of Nokia 6 that is incorrect (and very daunting). I will try to update when/if a non dotzero versions is ever released.. Pages: 1 2 3 … 399 400 ».

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. The first Android-powered smartphone to carry the Nokia name from HMD Global has been announced. The Nokia 6 features 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of on-board storage alongside microSD support, a 16 megapixel main camera, and a 3,000 mAh battery.. The form factor may not push the limits of design - the handset is a monoblock form sculpted from a single piece of aluminium - but it represents the modern design ethics of a smartphone with a 1920x1080 HD screen measuring 5.5 inches on the diagonal.. Nokia 6 (image: HMD Global PR). As expected, the Nokia 6 will run Android, and HMD has confirmed that it will ship with Nougat, the seventh major version of Google's operating system. Unlike the Nokia Lumia range of Windows Phone-powered handsets, using Android should allow the Nokia 6 to tap into the wide range of third-party Android applications available on the market.. Launching in China opens up a number of interesting dynamics.. Unlike the markets in Europe and North America, the Chinese market is one that is still going through its growth phase. Re-establishing 'brand Nokia' is going to be easier here than it would be in the saturated citadels where Nokia once ruled. It also keeps supply lines relatively short from the production facilities, and using a single retailer reduces the demand on logistics for HMD, which is still a company in start-up mode.. The Nokia 6 is clearly playing in the mid-range market. Shipping with a SnapDragon 430 system-on-chip is not going to set the world alight in terms of performance but the chipset should be able to hold its own against handsets at a similar price to the Nokia 6's 1699 Yuan ($245). Leaning on the Nokia brand, pairing up with Dolby to use its Atmos sound processing, and promoting the use of an aluminium unibody all tie in with a mid-range handset that punches above its weight... all of which tie in with the values many expect from the Nokia brand name.. That said, what we're looking at here is a handset that doesn't really push any technological barriers. The market has a lot of Android-powered smartphones using the 400 series SnapDragon chips that come in at the $200-$300 price point. Design is enough to sell high-end handsets from the likes of Apple, is that enough for mid-range Nokia-branded handsets from HMD?. HMD Global's CEO Arto Nummela (image: hmdglobal.com). The handset will go on sale 'early in 2017' and will be available exclusively in China through a partnership with retailer JD.com. Although a date for public availability has not been announced, HMD's CEO. Arto Nummela has previously told Forbes that "it is good practice to go on sale very soon after a launch.". With CES coming to a close HMD has made a late play to grab some headlines , even if it's not on the Las Vegas floor. Next up in the smartphone calendar is Mobile World Congress, starting on 27th February. If I was a betting man I'd expect the Nokia 6 to not only be on show in Barcelona to the world's press, but rolling out on sale in China at the same time..

Nokia 6 review: A great phone with one major drawback. The Nokia 6 has plenty to offer, but an underpowered chipset ultimately ruins the overall experience.. Nokia announced its return to the smartphone segment earlier this year, albeit in a new avatar: instead of manufacturing phones directly, it licensed its name exclusively to HMD Global, a Finnish company made up of ex-Nokia staffers. HMD Global would take care of the design of the phones, and the devices themselves would be built by Foxconn.. Under the new partnership, HMD Global rolled out three devices aimed at the budget segment: Nokia 3, Nokia 5, and the Nokia 6. The company also launched its flagship phone, the Nokia 8 late last month. We'll talk a lot about the Nokia 8 in a few weeks, but for now, we're going to take a look at the Nokia 6, Nokia's best showing yet in the budget segment.. HMD Global's decision to focus on the budget segment wasn't without merit. After all, the entry-level Lumia 520 dominated Nokia's sales charts for several years, and the company's focus on emerging markets like China and India allowed it to build a loyal user base in both countries. That's the target audience for the Nokia 6: customers from the Windows Phone days that have been clamoring for a device with Nokia's hallmark design running Android. The Nokia 6 delivers on that promise, but the device isn't without its drawbacks.. Nokia has a storied history when it comes to design, and the Nokia 6 continues that tradition. The aluminum unibody design combined with chamfered edges make this one of the better-looking phones in this segment. The antenna bands are discreet and are tucked away at the top and bottom of the phone. If you're using the black variant, you'll be hard-pressed to notice them.. It's great to see Nokia going after the same segment it attracted in the Windows Phone market.. The overall design language is classic Nokia, and that build quality is right up there with the best phones in the market. That said, the phone has huge bezels at the top and bottom up front, making it taller and wider than most phones in this segment. The Redmi Note 4 , for instance, also has a 5.5-inch screen, but it isn't as tall as the Nokia 6.. The sheer size combined with the flat back makes it uncomfortable to use the Nokia 6 one-handed. The power and volume buttons are located on the right, and they're not as tactile as the ones you'd find on the Redmi Note 4 or the Moto G5. Furthermore, the lack of a textured button for the power key means you'll end up hitting the volume down key when you're trying to switch on the display.. Thankfully, the Nokia 6 has a 3.5mm jack at the top of the device. What's not so great is the Micro-USB port at the bottom, which is starting to show its age. Round the back, the horizontal camera housing is reminiscent of the Lumia days, as is the Nokia logo emblazoned across the middle.. The camera sensor protrudes slightly from the body, making the phone wobble when you're using it while laid flat on a surface. And while the Nokia 6 is made out of metal, it has a matte finish that makes it easy to grip the device, and the coating also does a great job of preventing smudges across the back.. The Nokia 6 is one of the best-looking budget phones available today.. The Nokia 6 comes with capacitive navigation keys, with the back button located on the left, overview button on the right, and a home button in the middle. The home key has a fingerprint sensor, but the surface area is limited. There's a lot of wasted space on the bottom bar, and HMD could've done a better job of utilizing that by slotting in a larger home button. That said, the sensor itself is fast and doesn't pose any problems, as long as you get the placement right.. Overall, the Nokia 6 is one of the best-looking phones in this segment, and like Nokia devices of old, it's incredibly tough. The phone is definitely built to last, and if you're looking for a device that brings the classic Nokia design aesthetic to the world of Android, you won't be let down by the Nokia 6.. Coming to the display, the 5.5-inch LCD display on the Nokia 6 is one of the better panels in this category. Sunlight legibility is excellent, and I didn't have any issues reading text when outdoors. You don't have the option to adjust the color temperature, but the default setting should be plenty good for most users. Colors are accurate and vivid, and viewing angles are great.. The phone also has dual front speakers, with the earpiece doubling up as a secondary speaker. The second speaker certainly improves the experience when you're watching videos, but the sound itself coming out of the dual speakers isn't as loud as what you get on the Redmi Note 4 .. Things take a turn for the worse when we come to the performance side of things. The Snapdragon 430 is a capable chipset, but it doesn't do a great job of driving the Full HD display.. The Nokia 6 would have been a much more competitive device had it featured the beefier Snapdragon 625, a staple of the budget segment. As things stand, you're bound to notice a lot of lag and stutters during everyday usage, including mundane things like navigating the interface and browsing the web. You do get 3GB of RAM and 32GB internal storage, and there's also a microSD card slot if you're looking to extend storage.. As for the battery life, the 3000mAh battery manages to deliver a day's worth of juice with around three and a half hours of screen-on-time on average.. All Nokia devices come with stock Android with nary a customization, and in a segment that's chock full of phones offering a dizzying array of skins and layouts, it's a refreshing change of pace. There's little bloatware on the device — you get the Amazon and Kindle apps, and that's about it. You do have the option to sign into Amazon while setting up the device, and there's also the ability to restore your apps and settings from an older device and configure the Google Assistant .. As for the interface itself, the Nokia 6 features a Pixel -style launcher that lets you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access the app drawer. The notification pane and overview menus are standard, but there's no split-screen mode.. You do get the option to quickly launch the camera with a double press of the power key, and the ability to reject a call by turning the phone over on its side, and muting the ringer when you pick up the phone to take a call. The customizations end with the gestures and blue iconography, and the rest of the interface is unchanged from stock Android.. If you want quick updates, your only option in the budget segment is the Nokia 6.. That's a good thing, because the lack of any modifications to the user interface allows Nokia to consistently roll out fast updates. Back when it launched its first Android phones, HMD said it would deliver timely updates to all of its devices. And it managed to do just that.. The Nokia 6 is currently running Android 7.1.1 Nougat , and HMD Global has commenced the Android 7.1.2 Nougat rollout to the device. As for security updates, HMD Global is one of very few manufacturers delivering monthly patches on time. Samsung also does a good job of rolling out patches to its flagships, but it doesn't do so anywhere as fast (or as consistently) as HMD.. Xiaomi is also promising to roll out timely updates for its Android One device, the Mi A1, but we'll have to wait a few months to find out if the Chinese company can deliver on its word. Motorola used to be great at delivering updates consistently, but with a vastly expanded portfolio of devices, the company is no longer able to do that.. Simply put, if you care about updates — both platform versions and monthly patches — then the Nokia 6 is the device to get in the budget segment.. The 16MP camera on the Nokia 6 is better than most phones in this segment. The Moto G5 Plus is still the standout in this category when it comes to imaging prowess, but the Nokia 6 can hold its own next to the likes of the Redmi Note 4 and the Honor 6X. The phone comes with HMD Global's own camera app, which has blue accents at the top and bottom. You get toggles for the timer, flash, HDR, and switching between shooting modes and the front and rear cameras, and a button to access the camera settings.. The main problem with the camera is how long it takes to shoot images. There's a noticeable lag when you press the shutter button to the time it takes for the image to save in the gallery, particularly when using HDR.. As for the images themselves, photos taken in daylight conditions come out with plenty of detail, but low-light shots are devoid of colors.. The Nokia 6 is available for $229 , or ₹14,999 if you're in India. While the device has a lot going for it — particularly when it comes to the design and updates — the Snapdragon 430 is a major letdown. The performance is just not as fluid as what you get on the dozens of Snapdragon 625-powered devices in this segment.. The Xiaomi Mi A1 , for instance, costs the same and has a premium design aesthetic, stock Android with the promise of quick updates, and a dual camera that's better than what you get on the Nokia 6. The Moto G5 Plus similarly continues to be one of the best options in the budget segment, and you get a clean software experience along with the best camera on a budget device. Then there's the Moto G5S Plus, which builds on the foundations of the Moto G5 but with a dual camera at the back.. If you're looking to pick up a budget Nokia with a Snapdragon 600-series chipset, you may not have to wait long. The Nokia 7 made its debut in China earlier this month, and the phone should be heading to other markets shortly. The Nokia 7 is powered by the Snapdragon 630, and should hopefully fix the performance issues plaguing the Nokia 6.. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

Ketan Pratap , 23 August 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. The Nokia 6 is an Amazon India exclusive, priced at Rs. It looks great and feels solid, but isn't that easy to hold and use. Gadgets 360 rates the phone 7 out of 10. Nokia 6 design Nokia 6 specifications and software Nokia 6 camera performance Nokia 6 performance Nokia 6 battery life. The Nokia 6 was the first Nokia-branded Android smartphone unveiled by HMD Global , the new custodians of the iconic Nokia brand, at the beginning of this year. It was initially unveiled in China, and was exclusive there for a few months before being made available in other markets. For HMD Global, the Nokia 6 launch was its first step into the Android smartphone space.. the Nokia 3 ( Review ) and Nokia 5 have been launched in India, and we're only getting the Nokia 6 now.. It was announced for the Indian market back in June , and it is all set to go on sale in India from Wednesday via Amazon India .. The Nokia 6 is said to be in high demand in India already, as Amazon India claims that it received over one million registrations for the first sale. Of all three Nokia-branded Android smartphones, this is the one that is truly considered Nokia's comeback device. It offers some familiar design cues associated with the Finnish brand, and now we also get stock Android with the promise of quick updates.. It is also the highest-specced of the three models now available in India. However, its age is a problem.. The Nokia 6 is essentially a mid-range smartphone , one that was originally launched seven months ago and its specifications are behind today's standards. It might have a tough time keeping up with the current competition at its price point.. Is this a true comeback for the iconic brand, or is it just hype? We find out in our full review of the Nokia 6.. Much like the Nokia 3, the Nokia 6 ships in a playful retail box designed to remind you of the old Nokia days. The phone feels solid when you hold it in your hands, and the company says it has been milled from a single piece of 6000 series aluminium.. This gives the phone sturdiness which could help it survive minor drops. During our review, we accidentally dropped the Nokia 6 a couple of times and it suffered no damage whatsoever. The metallic back means that the phone is slippery and we would recommend using a back cover with the Nokia 6.. At 7.85mm, the Nokia 6 isn't the slimmest out there, but its 169g weight is reasonable for a phone with a 5.5-inch screen. We felt that single-handed use over long periods wasn't comfortable, as this phone is a little too wide, and the chamfered edges can be uncomfortable. We prefer phones with rounded edges when it comes to the grip.. There's Corning Gorilla Glass on the front, but it doesn't extend right to the edges and corners.. The power and volume buttons are on the right. Antenna bands can be seen running across the top and bottom of the phone's back. and cutting through the frame, but they are quite discreet. There's a 3.5mm audio jack at the top, while the charging port and dual speakers are on the bottom of the Nokia 6.. The hybrid dual-SIM tray can fit two Nano-SIM but. you have to choose between using a second SIM and a microSD card. The fingerprint scanner at the front is touch-sensitive. and doesn't need to be pressed. It also doubles up as a home button. Compared to other phones in the same price range, the Nokia 6's fingerprint scanner doesn't unlock. but is good enough for everyday use.. The primary camera is placed in an oval Chrome housing that is reminiscent of Nokia's Lumia days. The single sensor is accompanied by a dual-tone flash. The camera protrudes slightly, which is another reason to consider using a back cover. As seen on other Nokia devices, there's one brand logo in the front and another at the back.. The 5.5-inch screen has decent brightness, and colours are crisp as well. We had no issues with viewing angles or sunlight legibility. Unfortunately, there's no LED indicator for notifications, which the company has claimed was a conscious decision due to market research .. Overall, the Nokia 6 shouldn't disappoint anyone in terms of design, as it stands out from the competition which all tend to look the same. build quality will give you confidence in everyday use.. In the retail box, you will find a power adaptor, a charging cable, earphones, the standard documentation, a SIM ejector tool, and, of course, the phone itself.. The Nokia 6 features a 5.5-inch full-HD 403ppi IPS LCD screen. It is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor coupled with 3GB of RAM. The Snapdragon 430 SoC is common in phones at lower prices including the Lenovo K6 Note ( Review ), Lenovo K6 Power ( Review ), Vivo Y55L , Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime ( Review ), Panasonic Eluga Ray Max , and Motorola Moto G5 ( Review ).. The Nokia 6 packs 32GB of storage. and supports microSD cards of up to 128GB. It also has a 3000mAh battery. On the camera front, there's a 16-megapixel rear camera while the front camera's resolution is 8 megapixels, and both have f/2.0 apertures. There's a Micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, and stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos audio enhancement. There's 4G with VoLTE as well. Other connectivity options include USB-OTG, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 4.1.. HMD Global promised that it will ship stock Android on all Nokia-branded phones. This should make it relatively easy to roll out Android updates. The Nokia 6 runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box, and our review unit received the August security update over-the-air , in line with the company's promise of timely updates. Android O update for the Nokia 6. as well as the other phones in this series.. With Android Nougat, the Nokia 6 gets almost all the features one can find on Google's Pixel devices. One of our favourite features on the Nokia 6 is that you can perform actions with supported apps by simply long-pressing their icons. Android 7.1.1 also lets you have six quick toggles in the notifications shade as opposed to five in earlier versions.. You can quickly launch the camera app by pressing the power button twice. The Nokia 6 comes with has very few third-party apps such as the Amazon app, which is there in part because. this phone is exclusive to Amazon India. There are all the usual Google apps including Photos, which is the default Gallery app. The Nokia 6 provides a similar experience to that of the Moto G5 Plus ( Review ) which sells for around the same price.. The 16-megapixel primary camera on the Nokia 6 is quick to lock focus and can capture good amounts of detail. The phase detection autofocus helps here, but at times, we found that despite locking focus, it took a while for images to be captured and saved. We felt that images had muted colours, which a lot of people will not like. In our experience, even the HDR mode didn't really improve this. There was also noticeable distortion around the edges of macro and close-up shots.. The camera managed good shots at night if there was a good enough light source around. If there wasn't enough, photos came out almost completely black. Autofocus was also much less accurate in low light. We needed to tap the screen to focus manually, and it often took more than one attempt to get a shot right. Details suffered, and it's clear that the Nokia 6 cannot. compete with other phones in its price band when it comes to nighttime photography.. Tap to see full-sized Nokia 6 camera samples. The camera app is vanilla which means you won't get too many tweaking options unless you download a third-party app.. The 8-megapixel front camera does a good job with selfies, but also only if the lighting condition is good. It should be enough for casual social media uploads.. The Snapdragon 430 SoC has been fitted in a lot of smartphones available at lower price points than the Nokia 6. The phone isn't a slouch, but isn't the best in its class either. We were satisfied with how apps loaded and ran on the Nokia 6, and touch response was snappy too. 3GB of RAM should be good enough for most people.. We were pleased with gaming performance, and the Nokia 6 didn't stutter while playing games like Asphalt Nitro. Unfortunately, this phone gets warm when playing games, using the camera, or navigating with GPS, which makes usage a bit uncomfortable. Thankfully, heat dissipates soon enough after closing the app(s).. We had a good time watching videos on the 5.5-inch screen. The quality is good, but we did feel that other phones at this price level including the Moto G5 Plus have better screens.. In our standard benchmark tests, the Nokia 6 did comparatively better than other Snapdragon 430-based phones. It scored 45,205 in AnTuTu, 18fps in GFXBench, 22,650 in Quadrant, and 5,879 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme.. The dual speakers on this phone deliver loud and clear audio. You get Dolby Atmos sound enhancement, and the difference with it turned on and off is instantly noticeable. We can say that these speakers are the clearest we have heard on any phone in this price segment. Unfortunately, the bundled earphones are just average, so don't expect a lot from them. Our recommendation would be to use your own earphones with the Nokia 6.. When it comes to latching on to cellular networks in weak spots, the Nokia 6 will impress you. Calls were clear and we were able to make VoLTE (voice over LTE) calls using a Jio SIM. As of now, the Nokia 6 doesn't support direct 4G video calling offered by the likes of Jio.. The Nokia 6 ships with a non-removable 3000mAh battery which the company claims can deliver one day of mixed usage. In our experience, real-world usage wasn't that strong. The phone lasted for 15-16 hours with heavy use where we had Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, Google Maps, Google Photos, and WhatsApp open in the background almost the entire time. In our standard HD video loop test, the phone lasted for 11 hours and 30 minutes which is not bad at all.. We found that the Nokia 6 took over two hours to charge fully, which is longer than what we have seen from phones with larger batteries.. Verdict After a wait of over six months, the Nokia 6 has finally hit the Indian market. It does seem good enough for most everyday jobs. Its brand, design, and build quality are its biggest highlights. Stock Android is also a nice touch, and the confirmed Android O update is great news too. Music lovers will be happy with the high-quality speakers. However, this phone does have drawbacks. in terms of its cameras, battery life, and tendency to get hot.. The Nokia 6 is available exclusively on Amazon India starting Wednesday. 14,999, and so in terms of overall value, it falls short. Other phones with similar hardware are priced way lower. You could get the Moto G5 Plus ( Review ) or Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( Review ) within the same budget, both of which have better hardware. If you are fine with a bigger screen and don't mind using a custom UI, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 ( Review ) is also an option..

I bought this phone a while ago thinking it was a Nokia but it isnt its china phone they are only useing Nokia name for this ITS NOT A NOKIA. Rated 5 out of. I've read some of the negative reviews on this phone before writing my review. It seems some were unlucky to have software issues or they wanted a more advanced capability phone. This phone is at the budget end of mobiles so therefore will not have some of what you'd get from a more expensive option. I use a phone to make calls, text and browse the internet mainly and my husband downloads music and watches videos, trailers etc. We've both found our new phones to be great for all of this. We had old Nokia Windows phones so for us this phone is our first Android and a huge improvement. I love the big screen and browsing is good, not amazingly fast but good enough for me and for the price of the phone. It looks like a more expensive phone and is much more robust than other similar priced phones. I've had mine nearly 3 months and so far so good. I got the silver one as they didn't have the copper which is very popular. I'm very happy with the phone and saved £30 on it on offer so for the price I think it's a good phone.. Rated 5 out of. I get Nokia 6 in November to replace my Huawei p8 little 2017 (just bend in my pocket like banana) and now we got February and Im still loved my phone. Solid bulid and gorrila glass protect your phone from any damage. Great camera, massive (for this phone range) storage and battery are impressive. Rated 5 out of. I've only had this phone a few days ago, and decided to come away from Apple (iPhone 6). It's taken a bit of getting used to, purely because I'm so used to Apple, so that's no reflection on the phone itself.. These days, all the phones do the same thing, so I wasn't paying £800+ for a brand. Nokia, as usual, have produced a brilliant phone. It has everything you could want (including fingerprint scanner and face recognition). The design is really nice, and is a large screen. It can be difficult to use with only one hand, but that doesn't bother me, I wanted the bigger screen.. Battery life is brilliant, ive been using my phone for music for several hours a day, plus spending an hour or so (in total) on social media/generally browsing, texting etc and the battery was still above 40%.. For £200, this phone is an absolute bargain.. If you're already thinking about this phone, stop thinking, just buy it..

Nokia is back, and with it comes four new phones that look set to disrupt the market. At MWC 2017, the brand, which is now part of Finnish company HMD global, unveiled three new Nokia Android smartphones and a reboot of its classic Nokia 3310 complete with the iconic Snake game and its familiar ringtone. We spent some time with the Nokia 6, the most premium of the four new launches, to bring you a hands-on review. You can also check out our hands-on review of the Nokia 3310 here .. Also see: Nokia 8 rumours. The Nokia 6 isn’t brand-new to MWC 2017. It was launched exclusively in China in January, and according to Nokia it sold out in 23 seconds with more than one million pre-registrations. Thanks to that huge success, Nokia has decided to bring the Android smartphone to the rest of the world in the second half. of the year, positioned at the top of its new range alongside the Nokia 5 and Nokia 3. Whether it will be successful in the UK and other markets is yet to be seen, but we anticipate that the much-loved brand name will attract many.. You'll also like: Best new phones 2017. The Nokia 6 is as of 2 August available to buy in the UK exclusively through Carphone Warehouse. You can grab it for £17.99 per month, or SIM-free for £199.99.. The Nokia 6 sports a 5.5in Full HD Gorilla Glass screen housed within a body that’s made with a single block of 6000 series aluminium for a seamless unibody design that comes in Matte Black, Silver, Tempered Blue or Copper (which we’d argue is more of a pink). It’s also available in a shiny Piano Black if you’re willing to cough up the extra cash for the Arte Black Limited Edition, which also has extra storage space (we’ll talk more about that later). The Arte seems to take some design inspiration from Apple’s Jet Black iPhone 7, and like Apple’s offering picks up fingerprints within seconds so if that’s the sort of thing that you’re bothered by we’d recommend opting for another of the Nokia 6 options.. The Nokia 6 is more squared than its smaller siblings, the Nokia 5 and Nokia 3, which we did find made it slightly less comfortable to hold although slightly easier to grip. It measures 154 x 75.8 x 7.85mm which we found to be perfectly slim enough.. Overall, though, we’d say that this looks much like a flagship phone but with a low mid-range price tag that’s bound to appeal to many.. During our brief time with the phone we found the screen to be vivid and bright, but certainly not as impressive as some of its flagship rivals. Of course, that’s to be expected from a phone at this price point, but we’re still keeping our fingers crossed from a high-end smartphone from Nokia later this year.. Inside the Nokia 6 is a Snapdragon 430 processor with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage. If you’re after more storage and a RAM boost, you might want to opt for the Arte Black Limited Edition despite that fingerprint attracting back, because that’ll get you 64GB internal storage and 4GB RAM. Both models do however come with a MicroSD card slot that will allow you to add up to 128GB more memory.. We’re looking forward to putting the Nokia 6 through its paces when we get it back to the PC Advisor labs soon, but during our testing it performed perfectly speedily enough when launching and changing apps, including the camera, Gmail and Chrome. That said, the model we tried had nothing much stored on it, and we were unable to try playing a game or any heavy-duty multi-tasking and we think the 430 chipset may struggle to keep up. It's the same chip you'll find in the new Moto G5 , too, and you can pick that up for £169 rather than the Nokia 6's higher price tag.. You’ll find a 16Mp camera on the rear, and an 8Mp camera on the front, which is a solid offering for a phone with this price tag. There’s a dual-tone flash on the rear too, and Nokia has included HDR.. The Nokia 6 also boasts a fingerprint sensor for extra security, which sits neatly beneath the home button. On either side of that sensor are back and multi-tasking keys most Android users will be familiar with.. There’s Dolby Atmos sound with a smart audio amplifier and dual speakers, too, making watching videos on the small screen slightly more enjoyable.. The non-removable battery is 3,000mAh but of course we’ll need to wait until we’ve spent more time with the Nokia 6 to determine how long that’ll last in everyday use. It charges via MicroUSB rather than the USB-C that we’re getting used to seeing in new smartphones at the moment.. The Nokia 6 will ship with Android 7.1.1 Nougat, and Nokia prides itself on being simple and human so has decided to forgo any fancy overlay for a stock Android that it calls “Pure”. This will be a huge draw for fans of Google’s vanilla Android, and we found it a joy to use without being overcomplicated in any way. It’s intuitive and does away with anything unnecessary to make space for the essentials to be at the forefront. Nokia also promises regular updates to the software.. 1.4GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 octa-core processor. 16MP main camera, dual-LED flash, 1080p video at 30fps. 1.4GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 octa-core processor. 16MP main camera, dual-LED flash, 1080p video at 30fps. The Nokia 6 is a difficult one to offer a verdict on because we feel quite torn about it. If this were a smartphone launched by any of the other big players in the smartphone industry right now we’d probably say that it’s a decent smartphone with a really good price tag but nothing particularly outstanding in the current market. But because this is Nokia we’re talking about we’re strangely excited about it. We think it’s going to catch the attention of those who loved their Nokia phones years back thanks to their simplicity and reliability, and with such a great price tag we expect it’ll quickly become a popular choice for smartphone buyers. We’re looking forward to spending more time with the Nokia 6 and its siblings, and we’re intrigued to find out what the future holds for Nokia..
