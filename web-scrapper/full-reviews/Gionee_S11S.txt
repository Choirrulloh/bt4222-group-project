Gionee S11, Gionee S11S, Gionee M7 Plus, Gionee F6, Gionee F205, Gionee M7 Mini Launched: Price, Specifications, and More. Gadgets 360 Staff , 27 November 2017. Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. At its winter launch event in Shenzhen, Chinese smartphone manufacturer Gionee looked to catch up with the latest trend in the smartphone industry by showcasing eight FullView smartphones across different product lines and price points. Gionee's FullView smartphones, don't quite sport the 'all screen' look seen in some rival smartphones, but they have a higher screen-to-body ratio compared to the company's other devices. Out of the eight smartphones showcased at the event, one - the Gionee S11 - will head to India in the next couple of months, while another, the Gionee M7 Power , was launched in India earlier this month.. The first device unveiled at the event was the Gionee S11S , which comes with a 6.01-inch FullView full-HD+ (1080x2160 pixels) AMOLED display. The body of the Gionee S11S is made out of glass and metal, featuring a "shiny" finish with optical nano coating and a "3D-curve" design that's apparently inspired by cars. It packs a stainless steel frame and dual camera setups at the front and back - 16-megapixel+8-megapixel at the rear and 20-megapixel+8-megapixel at the front - with real time bokeh effect and Face Beauty 4.0 that's capable of applying different effects based on skin colour and face shape. The front camera has a field-of-view of 105 degrees. The phone is capable of creating "3D photos" by stitching multiple images together. The selfie camera can be triggered via the fingerprint scanner at the back, which can also be mapped to trigger different apps.. The Gionee S11S, like other phones showcased at the event, runs Amigo 5.0, Gionee's heavily customised flavour of Android. A new game mode will stop notifications from coming in when you are playing a game or watching a video. A new location-based service will push promotions to you when you walk into a restaurant or shop, and show you maps when you are at the airport, features that will be available only in China. All phones showcased at the event are dual-SIM devices with support for expandable storage and come with FM radio, 3.5mm audio jack, and a Micro-USB port.. In terms of specifications, the Gionee S11S comes with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It packs a MediaTek Helio P30 SoC and comes with NFC support. The S11S is powered by a 3600mAh battery with 18W (9V/2A) fast charging support. The Gionee S11S launch price is CYN 3,299 (approximately Rs. The Gionee S11 shares the same design as the S11S and comes with dual front and rear cameras (16-megapixel+8-megapixel at front, 16-megapixel+5-megapixel at rear), Helio P23 SoC, 5.99-inch full-HD+ display, a 3410mAh battery, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. The Gionee S1 launch price is CYN 1,799 (approximately Rs. 17,500), and like we mentioned earlier, it will launch in India soon.. Next up is the Gionee M7 Plus that comes with "dual security encryption chip" that can be used to encrypt contacts, photos, and messages, if you want. It comes with a live fingerprint ID scanner, which is capable of checking for a "live" fingerprint by looking at things like blood flow, in addition to pattern matching. It comes with a leather finish at the back that's been treated with a 105-step process with quality at par with various luxury brands, Gionee says. The frame is made out of stainless steel with 21K gold coating.. The Gionee M7 Plus feature a 6.43-inch full-HD+ AMOLED display with a screen-to-body ratio of 86 percent. It packs a 5000mAh battery and support for 10W wireless charging. The M7 Plus comes with 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and Snapdragon 660 SoC.

شده توسط: معین کریمی. قیمت جیونی اس 11 و اس 11 پلاس. دو گوشی جیونی اس 11 (Gionee S11) و جیونی اس 11 اس (Gionee S11S) همراه با نمایشگرهایی تمام صفحه و بدنه‌ای صیقلی معرفی شدند. مشخصات فنی و قیمت آن‌ها را در ادامه بخوانید.. کمپانی چینی جیونی امروز میزبان یک رویداد خبری بزرگ بود که در آن از دو گوشی جدید خود با نام‌های جیونی اس 11 و جیونی اس 11 اس پرده برداری کرد. هر دو ای ن محصولات، نسل جدیدی از گوشی های خانواده جیونی اس 10 هستند که همراه با خود پیشرفت‌های چشمگیری را نیز در اختیار کاربران قرار می‌دهند.. به عنوان پرچمداران جدید این کمپانی، دو گوشی جدید آن‌ها از بدنه‌ی زیبای شیشه‌ای بهره می‌برند. این شیشه سه بعدی است، اما از هر چهار طرف به شکل زیبایی خمیده شده تا ظاهر آن شبیه به گوشی پرچمدار شیائومی می 6 باشد. اگرچه شیشه‌ی می 6 معمولی بود و جنس شیشه‌ی به کار رفته در دو گوشی جیونی اس 11 و اس 11 اس همانند اچ تی سی یو 11 براق و بازتابنده است.. مدل جیونی اس 11 اس قدرتمندترین عضو این خانواده است. این محصول از یک نمایشگر 6.01 اینچی آمولد با وضوح +Full HD برخوردار است. در این جا یک رم 6 گیگابایتی همراه با حافظه 64 گیگابایتی و چیپست هلیو پی 30 مدیاتک به چشم می‌خورد. اما یکی از مهم‌ترین قابلیت‌هایی که نسل جدید پرچمداران جیونی از نسل پیشین به ارث برده‌اند، یک دوربین دوگانه در قسمت پشتی و یک دوربین دوگانه دیگر بر روی قاب جلویی است. دوربین های جلویی شامل دو سنسور 20 و 8 مگاپیکسلی بوده و دوربین های اصلی این گوشی را نیز ترکیبی از دو سنسور 16 و 8 مگاپیکسلی تشکیل می‌دهند.. یک سنسور اثر انگشت در قسمت پشتی این گوشی تعبیه شده است و پشتیبانی از NFC به منظور استفاده از سیستم پرداخت موبایلی نیز در آن دیده می‌شود. یک باتری با ظرفیت مناسب 3.600 میلی‌آمپر ساعت همراه با تکنولوژی شارژ سریع 18W نیز به شما تعهد می‌دهد برای مدت زیادی به پریز برق بی‌نیاز باشید.. و اما مدل ارزان قیمت‌تر اس 11 از یک نمایشگر 5.99 اینچی برخوردار است، اما نسبت ابعاد و وضوح آن با مدل اس 11 اس برابر است. این گوشی به جای هلیو پی 30، از یک چیپست هلیو پی 23 همراه با یک رم کمتر 4 گیگابایتی بهره می‌برد. با این حال هنوز یک حافظه داخلی 64 گیگابایتی و دو دوربین دوگانه، اما با ترکیبی متفاوت باقی مانده است.. دوربین دوگانه پشتی این گوشی را یک جفت سنسور 16 و 5 مگاپیکسلی تشکیل می‌دهند و دوربین دوگانه جلویی آن نیز شامل سنسورهای 16 و 8 مگاپیکسلی می‌شوند. همچنین یک باتری کوچکتر 3.410 میلی‌آمپر ساعتی در زیر قاب گوشی وظیفه‌ی شارژرسانی به دیوایس را بر عهده دارد.. هر دو گوشی از رابط کاربری اختصاصی Amigo OS 5.0 مبتنی بر اندروید نوقا بهره می‌برند. هرچند شاید انتظار نسخه‌ی جدیدتر اندروید را داشته‌ باشید، اما قابلیت‌های جدیدتر و متفاوتی نسبت به سایر محصولات را می‌توانید در آن مشاهده کنید.. مدل گران قیمت‌تر جیونی اس 11 اس با قیمت 500 دلار قابل فروش است و برادر کوچکتر آن جیونی اس 11 نیز تنها 273 دلار قیمت دارد. ناگفته نماند
