HTC One M9 Prime Camera - user opinions and reviews. Pages: 1 2 3 4 ». Keeps loosing signal and interrupting any screen I'm on with an ohhhh help where's the network screen.. Mar, 04 Feb 2017 Why there are no information about primary camera image sensor size or pixel size. more This sensor camera and HTC one A9's sensor are same. do it have infrared sensor if yes than how to use it?. Why there are no information about primary camera image sensor size or pixel size. I spent 3 hours searching for information.. I've been using this phone since the time it's launched and here are my reviews. Camera: Rare camera is amazing although it lags (rarely), but the extra yellow tinch it offers to the picture is amazing. Speed: unless you load it to the neck and do not keep clearing the recent apps, it is quiet smooth. Gives a very good hold in hand and looks classy. In ear headphone: Didn't expect it to be so great but HTC has set me a benchmark. Cons: This should have been a dual sim phone. Battery: Should have been a bit more, considering the powerful mediaTek processing it pack in. Battery lasts a day with 4G turned on throughout.. mir, 07 Jun 2016 It can't record 4k. This phone is absolutely shit no updates shittest camera lags alot full of crap. HTC One M9 Prime Camera - Post your opinion. nikum, 11 Oct 2016 is it dual sim? No. (bootloop reported identified and solved months ago :). nikum, 11 Oct 2016 is it dual sim? no. I got this phone in Poland and I don't know why some folks keep saying that it doesn't shoot in 4K... My version of Prime Camera Edition definitely does and apart from that the built-in quality is fantastic, pics are good enough for me and with my moderate usage time - some web browsing, texting, taking few pics etc. I have no probs to make it last 48 hours on single charge... The stereo speakers are just superb quality... Was considerin Moto X Play but after playing aroudn with both phones I went for HTC PCE - sound quality, 4K video, stereo speakers and overall quality plus not too much of a difference (slightly in favour of Moto X Play) when it comes to battery life.. And one more thing to summarize: this is my 1st ever HTC phone, so I am not a biased fan of it:). This is exactly how they should have priced the phone (m9) £300 from Argos UK! Absolute bargain! Ultra Megapixel front facing camera! OIS in the back camera! Boom sound, Micro SD, 1080p screen, infrared.... The only thing to complain about is the Micro usb is really tight! Maybe after a few weeeks it will loosen.... Sanju, 29 Sep 2016 Camera is too good but heating problem is it dual sim?. Thanks HTC for infrared port because remote controler all devices my home and office.. Please Help me...which is best...for overall...camera,performance,gaming :(. The main camera has optical stabilizer its very good! Ultra mega pixel selfie camera wow! Yes the phone does get warm but its made of metal! Let's not forget the Boom sound speakers! The screen is very bright too. Ive just put a 128gb card in hahaha. Camera is too good but heating problem. I have this phone,photo and audio quality is awesome, very good battery live,I cannot see any cons.. Pages: 1 2 3 4 ». Total of 73 user reviews and opinions for HTC One M9 Prime Camera ..

HTC Re-Launches One M9s As One M9 Prime Camera Edition: Device Now Available In Poland. 8 May 2016, 7:40 am EDT By Aaron Mamiit Tech Times. HTC has launched the HTC One M9 Prime Camera Edition, which looks very much like its previous flagship smartphone, the HTC One M9, but with a few tweaks to its specifications.. First surfacing in Poland, the HTC One M9 Prime Camera Edition features a 13MP rear-facing camera with optical image stabilization technology, compared to the 20MP rear-facing camera of the HTC One M9, and is powered by the MediaTek Helio X10 processor instead of the HTC One M9's Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. RAM and base expandable storage, however, have been cut to 2 GB and 16 GB, respectively, from 3 GB and 32 GB.. For those who have been paying attention to the variants that HTC has released of its previous flagship smartphone, the HTC One M9 Prime Camera Edition is actually just a renamed HTC One M9s, which was. in November 2015 to the company's home country of Taiwan.. Some of the specifications retained in the HTC One M9 Prime Camera Edition and the HTC One M9s are the 5-inch 1080p touchscreen display, the UltraPixel front-facing camera and the 2,840 mAh battery.. It is not clear why HTC decided. to change the name of the HTC One M9s. The smartphone was first spotted in Poland, but it has since been listed in each of the country websites of HTC for Europe, signaling a widespread release.. In Poland, the smartphone is being offered by the country's Play carrier for 1 Polish zloty (26 cents, 23 eurocents) for a monthly contract of 99.99 zloty ($25.78, €22.70). This makes the HTC One M9 Prime Camera Edition very much affordable as a mid-range smartphone, similar to how the HTC One M9s was marketed in Taiwan.. The release of the renamed smartphone in Europe comes just as preorders for the new flagship smartphone of HTC, the HTC 10, have started. to ship in the United States. The units being shipped are the unlocked versions that customers preorder directly from the HTC website. For customers who preordered the smartphone from carriers, the wait continues..

Network bands in regions may be different, depending on the mobile operator and your location. 4G LTE only available in select countries. Upload and download speeds also depend on the mobile operator.. Available storage is less due to phone software. Approximately 21 GB storage available for user content. Available storage is subject to change based on phone software updates and apps usage.. Battery times (talk time, standby time and more) are subject to network and phone usage. A Standby time specification ("specification") is an industry standard that is only intended to allow comparison of different mobile devices under the same circumstances. Power consumption in a standby state is strongly dependent on factors including but not limited to network, settings, location, movement, signal strength and mobile traffic. Comparisons of different mobile devices using such a specification can therefore only be done in a controlled laboratory environment. When using any mobile device in real life circumstances for which the mobile device is intended, the standby time could be considerably lower and will be strongly dependent on the factors mentioned above..
