As announced, the M3 Note was released in Beijing on April 6, 2016.. Pre-orders for the M3 Note began after the launch event on April 6, 2016. Sales began on April 30, 2016 in mainland China and on May 11, 2016 in India. The Meizu M3 Note was released with an updated version of Flyme OS, a modified operating system based on Android Lollipop. It features an alternative, flat design and improved one-handed usability.. The Meizu M3 Note features a MediaTek Helio P10 system-on-a-chip with an array of eight ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores, an ARM Mali-T860 MP2 GPU and 2 GB or 3 GB of RAM. The M3 Note reaches a score of 50,000 points the in AnTuTu benchmark and is therefore approximately 56% faster than its predecessor, the Meizu M2 Note. The M3 Note is available in three different colors (grey, silver and champagne gold) and comes with either 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage or 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage.. Unlike its predecessor, the Meizu M3 Note has a full-metal body, which measures 153.6. It has a slate form factor , being rectangular with rounded corners and has only one central physical button at the front. Unlike most other Android smartphones, the M3 Note doesn’t have capacitive buttons nor on-screen buttons. The functionality of these keys is implemented using a technology called mBack, which makes use of gestures with the physical button. The M3 Note further extends this button by a fingerprint sensor called mTouch.. The M3 Note features a fully laminated 5.5-inch LTPS multi-touch capacitive touchscreen display with a FHD resolution of 1080 by 1920 pixels. The pixel density of the display is 403 ppi.. In addition to the touchscreen input and the front key, the device has volume/zoom control buttons and the power/lock button on the right side, a 3.5mm TRS audio jack on the top and a microUSB (Micro-B type) port on the bottom for charging and connectivity.. The Meizu M3 Note has two cameras. The rear camera has a resolution of 13 MP , a ƒ/2.2 aperture, a 5-element lens, phase-detection autofocus and an LED flash. The front camera has a resolution of 5 MP , a ƒ/2.0 aperture and a 5-element lens.. The M3 Note received generally positive reviews.. Android Authority gave the M3 Note a rating of 8.2 out of 10 possible points and concluded that “the Meizu M3 Note packs a very large punch for its price”. Furthermore, the build quality, battery life and the good display were praised. Huffington Post stated that the Meizu M3 Note is “[an] affordable and highly functional Android smartphone, with a large HD screen, great design and impressive battery life”. Android Headlines also reviewed the device and concluded that “[the] overall fantastic performance and just a great experience in general make the Meizu M3 Note an easy recommendation for sure”. TechSpot gave the M3 Note a rating of 7.5 out of 10 possible points and noted that “the M3 Note could be a great budget smartphone purchase”. ^ "Meizu M3 Note website". ^ "Meizu M3 Note page - Full phone specifications". ^ "Possible Meizu M3 Note Specs Surface In China". ^ "Meizu's CEO Says Meizu M3 Note Will Launch Soon". ^ "Meizu Confirms M3 Note Will Be Announced On April 6th". ^ "Meizu M3 Note Surfaces On AnTuTu, Helio P10 SoC In Tow". ^ "Meizu Confirms M3 Note Will Be Made Out Of Metal". ^ "Meizu's M3 Note Mid-Ranger To Launch In India On May 11th". ^ "Meizu M3 Note - Antutu". ^ "Meizu M2 Note - Antutu". ^ Bailey Stein (July 8, 2016). ^ Dan Nessel (August 18, 2016).

Meizu m3 note review A great affordable option, but with few improvements over its predecessor. by Bailey Stein July 8, 2016. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. -Ships with outdated version of Android. Although the m3 note has a premium design, excellent battery life, and a good software experience, it offers few improvements over its predecessors. With the exception of its new design and fingerprint reader, the m3 note is largely more of the same. Meizu fans may be better off with the slightly less expensive m2 note or the slightly more expensive MX5.. Instead of utilizing the iPhone 5C -like colorful glossy plastic found on several previous m models, Meizu has constructed the m3 note almost entirely of aluminum. Although one could argue that this change takes away from the iconic character of previous iterations, it is very difficult to deny that the m3 note’s design is both sharp and assertive. Premium design aspects such as the seemingly engraved antenna lines, symmetrical bottom, and 2.5D curved front glass are rarely found integrated so well at this price point.. is fair to say that the combination of the single physical button as well as several other design aspects makes the m3 note appear very similar to the iPhone. This is nothing new, however, as Meizu has long found inspiration in Apple products. One could argue, however, that for many end users, what matters most is how well the phone looks and feels in the hand, rather than how similar it appears to a competing smartphone. Still, some may consider the design to be too derivative for their liking.. Sadly, Meizu has ditched the wonderful IGZO panels found on the m1 note and m2 note in favor of a more traditional, presumably less expensive panel. Although the m3 note retains both display size and resolution, at 5.5″ and 1080P, it lacks a bit of the vividness and saturation of the displays found on its predecessors.. Despite its departure from stock Android, I really enjoyed my time with Flyme 5 and feel that this is one of the m3 note’s best aspects. Users can also look forward to future updates, which are sure to only improve the experience further. While Flyme 5 won’t be to everyone’s tastes, it is easy to get accustomed to and once you’re used to it, it’s a pleasure to use.. Despite its relatively young age, Meizu’s m series has earned a reputation for offering some of the best user experiences at affordable prices. We were impressed from the start of the note lineup, which we echoed in our Meizu m1 note review , and also found its arguably premature successor, the Meizu m2 note , to be excellent in somewhat different ways.. After nearly a year later, our Meizu m3 note review is here. Is this smartphone truly outstanding in a manner similar to its predecessors or does it simply fade into the massive sea of affordable smartphones? Let’s find out with our comprehensive Meizu m3 note review!. It is very difficult to deny that the m3 note's design is both sharp and assertive. The build quality here is also quite remarkable, something that can’t often be said about phones in this price category. The power and volume buttons, which have gone from the left side to the right side with this iteration, are tactile and feel solid. The m3 note also feels great in the hand overall, and the curved aluminum edges are most definitely appreciated.. Instead of following the traditional three-button Android navigation key layout, Meizu has implemented a single button on the front of the m3 note. A press down on this physical button will take you home, whereas a tap will take you back. When wanting to switch apps, you can simply swipe up from either side of the physical button to access Flyme’s multitasking menu. In my opinion, this is a much more intuitive way to interact with your phone, even if it may take some time to get used to.. Some may consider the design to be too derivative for their liking. Better than the Redmi Note 3's display, but not quite on par with its predecessors. Despite this, the m3 note’s display is still better than most in this price category as it offers excellent viewing angles, good contrast, and the option to make slight adjustments to the color temperature. I found sunlight readability to be mediocre, however, and color reproduction could have definitely been better.. For scratch and shock resistance, the glass is coated with Dinorex T2X-1, which seemed to perform well as I did not notice any scratches on my unit after a few weeks of use.. While many manufacturers like Xiaomi have transitioned to using Qualcomm ‘s mid-range processors in budget devices, Meizu has chosen to stick with Mediatek for the m3 note. That shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, however, given the current circumstances between the two.. With that said, the m3 note is using a Mediatek Helio P10 , which could be considered comparable to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 617. Overall performance is still decent for the price, however; apps are sometimes noticeably slow while loading, but performance was otherwise fairly good.. You can purchase the m3 note with either 2 or 3 GB of memory. Light-to-moderate multi-taskers should be fine with the 2 GB model, but heavier multi-taskers may want to check out the 3 GB model.. Higher-end games like Asphalt 8 struggled with slow load times and very low frame rates. Unfortunately, gaming performance was very poor on the m3 note in my testing. Although the most popular casual games seemed to play fine, higher-end games like Asphalt 8 struggled with slow load times and very low frame rates, even in “performance mode.” It appears that the Mali T860 MP2 GPU simply isn’t enough to drive these titles. This is truly disappointing as even the m1 note had no trouble in this department.. Since the m3 note is an unlocked dual-SIM smartphone, you can use two individual SIM cards simultaneously. If the phone’s 16 or 32 GB of storage isn’t enough and you are willing to give up one of the SIM card slots, you can expand the phone’s storage via microSD, up to 256 GB.. Call quality seemed to be mediocre in my testing. Although the m3 note fully supports 4G LTE in countries where it is officially sold, those living more peripatetic lifestyles may have trouble acquiring more than 3G or even 2G signals in some countries. In the United States, for example, the m3 note is limited to HSPA+ on AT&T and T-Mobile.Â. Call quality seemed to be mediocreÂ. in my testing, and although my earpiece sounded fine, callers said that they sometimes had difficulty understanding me. Unless you make many calls, however, this is unlikely to be an issue.. Meizu has embedded a fingerprint reader in the physical home button, and I found it to be fairly fast and very accurate. It’s always great to see fingerprint readers, especially at this price, as they offer much more convenient security.. The m3 note is using the older non-reversible microUSB standard, and although it may disappoint those who have already made the switch to the growingly ubiquitous USB Type-C , it will likely appeal to those who do not wish to purchase brand new cables. It’s difficult to criticize Meizu here, as they have yet to make the transition for their budget smartphones.. The single side-firing speaker on the m3 note is reasonably loud, but moderately distorted, especially at higher volumes. It certainly does the job, but it’s not a step up from the m1 note nor the m2 note .. Thanks to its 4100mAh non-removable battery, the m3 note is able to provide excellent battery life. During my time with the device, I consistently achieved about five and a half hours of screen on time with twelve to twenty-seven hours of use. On one occasion, I used the phone for a day and a half, but still achieved a very respectable four and a half hours of screen on time.. Battery life on the m3 note is better than the vast majority of smartphones, including flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S7. This, of course, is very impressive considering the phone’s price.. The Meizu m3 note’s 13 MP rear camera offered average performance for the phone’s price. Sadly, captured images often lacked detail, were surprisingly soft, and lacked the dynamic range required for higher contrast scenes. Although the camera offers images with just the right amount of saturation and accurate color reproduction, excessive noise, regardless of lighting conditions, often distracted from the overall picture.. The camera’s autofocus did not perform as well as I had hoped either, as it often seemed slow and sometimes refused to focus entirely. Unfortunately, it seems that the m3 note does not offer much of an upgrade over the m2 note in the camera department. Although there have been some minor camera software improvements, the quality of the m3 note’s camera seems to be very similar to that of the m2 note .. Out of the box, the Meizu m3 note runs Meizu’s custom Flyme 5 OS, over Android 5.1 Lollipop. It would have been nice to see Android 6.0 Marshmallow , as it has been out for nearly a year now, but Flyme does do a nice job at substituting features like fingerprint reader support.. Overall, Flyme is dramatically different from stock Android, and it’s probably fair to view it as a glorified spinoff of iOS. With that said, Flyme is one of the most well refined and polished Android skins out there. Flyme 5 is easily Meizu’s best skin yet, and I was ecstatic to see small but major improvements like the addition of a settings shortcut in the notification panel (finally!) and a redesigned beautifully animated multitasking menu. My excitement extended to seemingly previously established stock apps as well, thanks to Meizu’s excellent design and implementations.. I really enjoyed my time with Flyme 5. The Meizu m3 note is available in China starting at 799 RMB (â$120) and can be imported from third-party resellers for about $200. In India, the pricing is comparatively a bit higher at 9,999 Rupees (â$150). The base model includes 16 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM, but another model with 32 GB of storage and 3 GB of RAM is also available. Each model is available in multiple color options, depending on the region.. The Meizu m3 note packs a very large punch for its price with its premium design, excellent battery life, and exceptional software experience. availability, poor gaming performance, and unimpressive camera do not help the m3 note stand out. And now that Flyme 5 is available on Meizu’s older hardware, there’s nothing particularly compelling about the m3 note. With the exception of its new design and fingerprint reader, the m3 note simply does not improve on what was already established with the Meizu m2 note .. If you’re okay without a metal design and fingerprint reader, the Meizu m2 note is likely the best fit for you, if you can get it for a bit less than the m3 note. Otherwise, the Meizu MX5 is also still a great option, for a bit more. With the MX5, you’ll be getting a much better display, better performance, and a better camera.Â. If you’re willing to venture outside of Meizu’s turf, the slightly better Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is also a great alternative to the m3 note, and is sold at the same price in India.. We want to know, do you think Meizu’s approach to this update was too passive? Would you actually buy an m3 note over an m2 note, just for the refreshed design and fingerprint reader?

Meizu’s M3 Note may be cheap, but it doesn’t hold a candle to other budget phones. Meizu’s M3 Note is sleek and cheap, but not as good as its competitors.. Meizu’s M3 Note is sleek and cheap, but not as good as its competitors.. Meizu’s M3 Note is sleek and cheap, but not as good as its competitors.. Easy to scratch the plastic back. Can’t compete with other budget phones. Wait, is this an Android? No, it’s Flyme. This phone raises the bar for budget displays. Under par for the mobile photographer. Phone Reviews Product Reviews. Chinese smartphone makers started the wave of packing strong specs into sleek phones with attractive price tags to beat out the iPhone in China. Companies like Meizu, Xiaomi, and Oppo led the charge for cheap phones, but nowadays, high-end budget phones are a dime a dozen, and you can buy a quality smartphone for less than $300 with ease.. The affordable phone market is well and truly saturated, and companies need absolutely stellar devices to compete in this cutthroat world. We decided to give the Meizu M3 Note a spin to see how it compares to other high-quality budget phones like the Huawei Honor 5X and the Lenovo G4 lineup.. We know what you Apple fan boys and girls are thinking – that phone looks an awful lot like an iPhone. You’re not wrong, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Sure, Meizu isn’t going to score any points for originality in design, but it’s still somewhat uncommon to come across a mid-range device that looks as great as the M3 Note.. The phone isn’t overly thin, but it has a nice-premium feel to it, despite the fact that it’s not made of metal. Although the M3 Note may look like it’s made from aluminum in some pictures, it’s actually plastic with a metallic finish. It’s reminiscent of the LG G3’s metallic-looking plastic back plate.. Unfortunately, that plastic back scratches way too easily. I scarred the back of the M3 Note on the same day it arrived in the mail. The back got scratched when I simply slid the phone gently across a table. There really wasn’t anything under the phone, although there must have been a speck of dirt or something, because it certainly made a scratch. You’re going to want to buy a case to protect it from the inevitable scratches.. Otherwise, the phone has a nice look and feel. On the front, you’ll find the display, along with a multipurpose home button that has a built-in fingerprint sensor, the speaker, front-facing camera, and ambience sensor. The phone is built so that the front-facing camera and ambience sensor look as similar as possible, and the two sensors are placed on either side of the speaker for perfect symmetry.. On the back, that’s no different. The camera is placed smack-dab in the middle of the back, and the camera’s flash lies directly under it. On the right side, you’ll find the standard power button and volume rocker, and on the left, the SIM/MicroSD card slot tray. That’s right, the M3 Note is dual-SIM, however if you use a MicroSD card, you’re going to have to sacrifice that second SIM spot.. The back is also home to the same antenna band layout as the iPhone that crosses along the back and sides of the device. On the bottom, there’s a Micro USB port with a speaker grill on one side and microphone on the other. The headphone jack sits at the top of the phone.. It’s not terribly original, but the design is still attractive. Sadly, the scratchable plastic back drags it down, especially when you compare it to the Honor 5X, which sports a more durable aluminum back plate.. Meizu continues its iPhone-inspired design with the software. The M3 Note runs Android, but much like Samsung uses TouchWiz to customize Android and HTC uses Sense, Meizu alters the look of Android with its own user interface Flyme.. Just like in iOS, there isn’t an app drawer, so all your apps are laid out across your home screens. You can make app folders, like on any other Android phone, but there’s no drawer for stowing away the apps you don’t use too often. Thankfully, if you prefer the look of stock Android, you can simply download the Google Now launcher from the Google Play Store. You may, however, think twice about doing so.. Flyme comes with a number of great apps that could really help your day-to-day use. For example, the Security app offers a way to ‘clean’ your files, delete temporary files, close unused apps, check how much RAM is being used by your open apps, edit your app permissions, and even perform basic antivirus functions. It’s a cool app that’s well designed and easy to use, and could speed up your phone significantly if you use it enough.. Another interesting app is Toolbox, which basically offers, as the name suggests, a suite of tools. You’ll get a flashlight, mirror, compass, level, ruler, and magnifier, all easily accessible within the Toolbox app. Again, it’s well designed and everything looks great, and the app could really come in handy.. All in all, while Flyme does have a distinctly iOS look, it offers a few features that go beyond a simple iOS knock off and really bring Flyme into its own. It’s a competitive version of Android, and while it certainly makes a push for Meizu’s own services, those services can be pretty useful. Not only that, but unlike iOS you have some serious control over the look of Flyme. There’s even a Theme app that offers themes so you can find the perfect look for you.. Perhaps the worst thing about Flyme is that it there are hints here and there to remind you that this isn’t originally an English-language phone. You’ll find a few spelling mistakes. It’s nothing overly embarrassing or difficult to understand, but there really shouldn’t be spelling mistakes in an operating system, especially if you’re trying to make waves around the globe.. Gone are the days when buying a ‘budget’ phone meant dealing with a sub-par, 720p screen.. Unfortunately, the device is a little dated when it comes to versions of Android – it ships with Android 5.1, and there’s no update available to upgrade. Our bet is that there never will be, which poses serious security concerns.. With bugs like Stagefright and Heartbleed becoming more common, it’s particularly important that phones receive updates in a timely manner. Having a highly customized UI on top of Android is one sure fire way to ensure that updates take a long time to process. It’s a real shame that Meizu hasn’t committed itself to getting Android updates to its users in a timely fashion.. The navigation on the M3 Note is going to be a little difficult for Android users to get used to, but it’s certainly an interesting idea. There are no standard Android home, back, and apps buttons. Instead, there’s a single button that is used for both home and back, and a gesture for apps. The home button, when pressed, takes you home, but you can also tap it like you would a touch screen to go back.. Meizu M3 Note Compared To. To access your open apps list, you swipe up from the very bottom of the screen. Once you do that, you’ll find a card-like list of apps, as well as a “close all” button – Flyme beat Google to the punch on that one. When you press the clear all button, you’ll be told exactly how many MB worth of RAM you just cleared, which is a nice little touch.. Also in the home button is the fingerprint sensor, and I have to say, while it doesn’t move as quickly as some of those fancy shmancy new fingerprint sensors on devices like the OnePlus 3, it surprised me how quickly it did act. For the most part, it detected my fingerprint with no issue. Sure, it misread my print perhaps once every ten attempts, but that’s common with many fingerprint sensors. Simply lifting my finger and trying again usually worked.. Gone are the days when buying a ‘budget’ phone meant dealing with a sub-par, 720p screen. The screen on the Meizu M3 Note is an IPS LCD with a resolution of 1080p. It’s 5.5-inches in size, and while the phone certainly isn’t bezel-less, the bezels on the side are very thin.. The colors are bright and pop out, it has decent viewing angles, and unless you’re looking at some super tiny fonts, you really aren’t going to feel like you need more pixels. That’s a pretty big achievement for a handset in this price range – often manufacturers skimp out on display in favor of boosting the specs a little. For this phone, it seems like Meizu has done the opposite.. Looks and design are great and all, but when buying a budget phone, it’s especially important to look at specs, as mid-range handsets are less likely to last as long as their more expensive counterparts, especially under heavy use.. If you’re considering the M3 Note, you should be aware that it is not a high performer. The version we tested had 16GB of storage with 2GB of RAM, however it can also be bought with 32GB and 3GB of RAM. Other specs include a MediaTek Helio P10 chipset, which offers a quad-core 1.8GHz Cortex-A53 and a quad-core1.0GHz Cortex-A53 chip along with a Mali-T860MP2 GPU. MediaTek processors are notoriously finicky and don’t usually perform well with graphic-intense games.. According to our tests, the M3 Note benchmarks 41,235 on AnTuTu, and 2,725 on GeekBench 3 (multi-core). Sure, there are eight cores, but when those eight cores tend to run pretty slowly, you’re still left with an underperforming phone. Unfortunately, the bad news isn’t over yet. While the M3 Note scored slightly higher than the two-generations old M1 Note on AnTuTu, it actually scored significantly lower on GeekBench 3 – the M1 Note achieved a fairly high 3,988. I scarred the back of the M3 Note on the same day it arrived in the mail.. Let’s make something clear – these benchmark scores aren’t great, but you’re unlikely to notice if you’re not a power-hungry user. If you generally stay away from mobile gaming or opening 30 Chrome tabs a minute, you’ll probably still do decently well with this phone. Still, when you consider the fact that you can get the all-metal Huawei Honor 5X with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chip for the same price, the M3 Note’s performance is embarrassing.. Fortunately, the battery redeems the underperforming processor.. The M3 Note is powered by a pretty hefty 4,100mAh battery, which really does well. It will definitely get you through a day of normal use. In fact, it got me through two. Sure, if you’re a mobile gamer this phone isn’t going to last two days, but most people will get two days with no problem. If you’re good at ensuring you charge your phone at night, don’t think twice about battery, it will get you through a full day of use without any problems at all. Interestingly enough, despite the impressive battery size the phone isn’t overly thick – nice job, Meizu!. The camera on the M3 Note is 13 megapixels, and comes with a dual-tone flash. It’s lacking some of the features its more expensive counterparts might have, like optical image stabilization, but it does have phase detection autofocus, which should, at least on paper, help the camera focus quickly.. The camera app offers a similar experience to the iPhone camera app. You have quick access to the flash, countdown timer, filters, and camera settings; you can turn on HDR, gridlines and even add a level gauge to ensure that your photos aren’t tilted. Shooting modes on the M3 Note include Auto, Manual, Beauty, Panorama, Light Field, Slow-Mo, Macro, and GIF. That’s right, with the M3 Note you have a GIF mode to quickly and easily create shareable GIFs.. Unfortunately, most of the M3 Note’s camera features seem to be somewhat superficial. There are tons of great options and features, but the actual photos on the device simply aren’t that great. They’re generally quite noisy, and the autofocus doesn’t always work very well, either. Still, with HDR on, photos look a little better, and colors are generally better produced, but obviously that only works in situations without too much motion.. Low light is a bit of a tough one for this camera. You’ll be able to see what you’re taking a photo of thanks to the dual-tone flash, but in general it’s not going to produce something you’ll want to show in a “shot on M3 Note” campaign.. Things are a little better when taken out of Auto mode and into manual, but that only helps people who know what they’re doing and have enough time to devote to picking the right settings for the shot.. The front-facing camera isn’t bad, and it’s certainly good enough for taking selfies. Contrast is decent enough and colors look fine. It’s not going to blow your mind, but it’s also not going to seriously disappoint.. Overall, this is not a phone you will buy specifically for the camera. It’s fine for taking shots on the go, but if you’re attending an event where you know you’re going to want to take photos, bring a better camera or rely on your friend’s iPhone. As long as you’re taking photos during the day or in decent light, the photos will be fine.. Although the Meizu M3 Note looks nice and the battery is great, the performance just isn’t really there, and the camera is mediocre. For the price, you can get a number of other more powerful smartphones that also take better pictures. It’s a tough time for budget phone makers, because there are so many affordable devices out there with decent specs and good design. The Moto G4 Plus is a great example.. If $200 is all you can spend on a smartphone, consider the Huawei Honor 5X instead. It’s actually made of metal, has a fingerprint sensor, packs a decent Qualcomm processor, and takes good pictures for $200. Another alternative is the Lenovo Moto G4 Plus, which costs $250. It’s not all metal like the Honor 5X, but it does have a fingerprint sensor, water resistance, and fast charging.. Those with a little more money in their pockets might also consider the $400 OnePlus 3 or the ZTE Axon 7, which boast the same high-level specs of a Samsung Galaxy S7 and gorgeous designs.. Unfortunately, Meizu’s M3 Note doesn’t bring enough power or style to the table, and we can’t recommend it.. Add Us To Your Social Channels.

Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars All-rounder in the worst everything!. Meizu is the worst company, I had so many hopes and expectations when it took put Meizu m3 note in India that I bought it as soon as it first appeared on Amazon, ever since I bought this phone, its like I am cursed, the screen is very delicate and the build quality is below average (waaaay below) screen broke even after having a screen and a tempered glass which I took responsibility of and got it repaired, then the screen displayed the contents in an inverted fashion, so again gave it back to the horrible and poorly connected service center, then after a while the home screen button stopped working (also the fingerprint sensor) and when I finally felt like I had enough from the phone and sell it, I updated the phone from the Ota update I received form the company itself and the screen has again inverted for which the company or service center neither would take the responsibility and compensate for the loss and hence I have to pay for the additional expense. Horrible company, horrible service center, customer support is unavailable most of the times and devices just resemble the ones Apple makes but are nothing compared to them not even justifies for the cost at which these devices come. Was this review helpful to you?. 1.0 out of 5 stars The mobile is excellent but Meizu has not resolved the sign in problem .... The mobile is excellent but Meizu has not resolved the sign in problem for the google apps. This has happened to me in the past and it continues to happen! There is no way to resolve the sign-in problems for the google apps. I have tried every way possible. The service center people say that it is better to return it if possible. Many times even they are not able to resolve it. If one cannot sign in to google accounts there is no way to sync contacts! Play store won't work! I have tried everything but it just doesn't help. I hope amazon takes back the product and informs the sellers and the brand of this problem! Please do something about it!. Was this review helpful to you?. 5.0 out of 5 stars Review after 4 days.....

The audio output through head set is less, but loud speaker is good Flyme oa is good except the updates are minimal, and after the updates the google play store got removed Eventhough VoLTE is given in specifications, it was not enabled, i had to enable it in engineering mode The performance of processor, GPU with 3GB RAM is fluidic, can easily handle plenty of apps Battery backup is excellent, with super mode u can get one day backUp even with 20% battery.

If you don't need lots of storage, you can use the microSD slot for a second SIM card. Tired Fat body with less spirit than you'd hope. The main camera is just average; stay away if you only make your memories with a smartphone. Ships with outdated Lollipop version of Android.. Author: Maurizio Pesce Maurizio Pesce. If you're looking for a big, cheap phone, try this 5.5-inch phablet from China.. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and Google Pixel are great Android phones. At about $700, they're also expensive. So what if you're someone who goes for value, someone who just wants decent performance at a decent price?. OnePlus , if you can get one. Huawei's Honor 5X if you're on a budget. And now, the Meizu M3 Note , a big phone (or phablet, if you prefer the antiquated term), that goes for about $170.. You might remember Meizu from the Ubuntu Phones project slowly coming to market. The company started shipping phones in 2008, and wants to be among China's top five vendors soon. It's already got a high-end handset, the PRO 5 , and wants to break into the budget market with the M series, which offers acceptable specs at a reasonable price. The M3 Note sports a 1 GHz octa-core 64-bit processor and just 2 or 3GM of RAM. But it's got the power to handle your day-to-day needs. The handset offers 16 or 32GB of internal storage and a microSD slot to add up to another 128 gigs.. Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus, the M3 Note's aluminum body is slightly shorter and just a bit thicker. The huge 4,100 mAh battery offers twice the life the iPhone. You'll get more than two days with normal use, even if you're pushing your phone hard. I like the shape more than other fat phones, mostly because it has a flat aluminum body with rounded corners. My only critique is the front lacks character.. The M3 Note lasts more than two days with normal use.. The 5.5-inch IPS LCD display is Full HD with 403-ppi resolution, and covered with Gorilla Glass 3. The screen offers good colors and deep blacks, but it isn't terribly bright outdoors. Below the screen sits one Samsung-style oval home button with a fingerprint sensor. This is one of the peculiar features of this phone is that it doesn't offer capacitive keys on either side of the home button—since I'm coming from an iPhone, I love this part. For instance, while using the Galaxy S7 Edge, I kept wrongly pressing the back key or the multitasking keys while just using the phone with one hand. It was annoying hated it every single time. To go back in an app on the M3 Note, you just tap the home button. To exit the app, you give the home button a regular press. The multitasking window itself is accessible with a simple swipe from the bottom of an open app. That same gesture is how you access the multi-window feature; you pick two open apps to run simultaneously on the screen.. Like every other Meizu smartphone, the M3 Note too comes with the company's Flyme skin that runs on top of the old Android 5.1 Lollipop. It's clean and smooth, and one of the most likable Android customizations I've seen, despite the older version of Google's OS. You get the standard Android gestures—double-tap the screen to wake, slide upward to unlock, swipe down to see notifications—plus some more characteristic ones. While listening to music, sliding horizontally skips to the next song or restarts the song you're playing. Drawing eight letters on the screen will activate one of your preferred apps. Just like any other phone, the Do Not Disturb mode can be scheduled or manually activated, but I also love the feature that lets you program times for the phone to automatically shutdown and reboot.. It's good for casual photography, but I don't recommended you make it your primary shooter.. In the middle of the back cover sits that big eye of the main camera. The 13-megapixel sensor can shoot decent pictures outdoors even in moderate light conditions, but can't operate at its best indoors and in low light. The f/2.2 aperture isn't great for low-light pictures, which are often noisy and can suffer from lack of detail and white balance flaws. The focus is quick and accurate, though, and the shutter's response is very reactive. There are your standard filters and shooting modes, including a mode to capture real-life GIFs. Overall, the M3 Note is good for casual photography, but I don't recommended you make it your primary shooter.. If battery life and a good value are chief among your concerns, the Meizu M3 Note is a good buy. Sure it lacks a premium hardware features and runs older software. But at this price, I can't think of a better machine than this.. When you buy something using the retail links in our product reviews, we earn a small affiliate commission.
