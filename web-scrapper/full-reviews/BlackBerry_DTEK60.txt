CNET también está disponible en español.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers.. The Good Polished design, good battery life and performs well in day-to-day use. The 21-megapixel camera takes detailed images and shoots 4K video. The Bad The fingerprint sensor is finicky. The phone lacks water-proofing and its security features are a bit overhyped.. The Bottom Line The DTEK60 is a fast, capable phone. Its focus on productivity and security will make business users quite happy. As for the rest of us, the phone is rather vanilla.. Design: If the DTEK60 looks familiar that's because it's a copy of the Alcatel Idol 4S -- same beautiful 5.5-inch AMOLED display, same sleek metal band and same glass back. The only physical differences are the more obvious camera bump on the DTEK60 and its dark gray color -- the Idol 4S is black. Performance: The DTEK60 is faster than the Idol 4S and is one of the speedier midrange phones out there. During my time with it, the Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of memory kept things humming along -- I never experienced any lags. Security: BlackBerry claims this is "the world's most secure Android phone." That's akin to a restaurant claiming it has the world's best pizza. On its website, BlackBerry advertises quick security updates, Enterprise support and access to its encrypted BlackBerry servers. Android has many of these security features (or similar ones) built directly into its operating system. The DTEK60 is a secure phone, but so are most phones running Android 6.0.1 or 7. Battery: The DTEK60's best feature. In our continuous video playback test, the DTEK60 lasted just over 14 hours. That is better than the Google Pixel XL , Motorola Moto Z and iPhone 7 Plus. Camera: The camera has 21 megapixels and shoots 4K video. In good light, the focus speed is decent and images have nice detail. It will handle snaps of those business receipts quite well. But the camera lacks optical image stabilization. In low light, it struggles to focus and images are quite noisy. Convenience key: Like the Idol 4S, there's a programmable hardware key to quickly open apps and trigger tasks. Using this with the camera, or to mute a call was pretty sweet. My only hangup is that the screen must be unlocked before using the convenience key -- which isn't always convenient. Fingerprint sensor: The scanner, located on the back, rarely read my finger correctly on the first attempt. You and your fingers might have better luck. BlackBerry exclusives: I like the onscreen keyboard and that the BlackBerry Hub app lets me put all my messages in one place: emails, text, social media. The Productivity Tab is a nifty way to quickly check scheduled events. Then there's BlackBerry Messenger, or BBM, which is a bit like MySpace. When I logged in, I found only two people I know -- so I didn't use it much. BlackBerry's newest phone is the DTEK60.. BlackBerry's newest release, the DTEK60, is a midrange Android phone that aims to be as productive and secure as it possibly can. Its target is clear: the business user.. But if you're not a business user, the DTEK60 might just seem so-so. While its specs and performance are good, there are better phones at lower prices that are just as useful and far more enjoyable -- like the OnePlus 3T .. The BlackBerry DTEK60's camera gets some coffee. The DTEK60 is one of the nicest BlackBerrys released in a long time. It's filled with useful features and decent specs. Business users should find it quite the capable phone. But for the rest of us, it misses out on being fun. I'm not excited to pick it up and use it like I am a Google Pixel or an iPhone or a OnePlus 3T. Those phones offer good security and productivity features, but they also have things like Google Assistant, iMessage and better cameras. Through use, those phones feel like they become a reflection of who I am. Whereas the DTEK60 feels like I'm using a scientific calculator -- it wants me to adapt to it. Maybe that's what makes this a good work phone.. 2.15GHz + 1.6GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820. 1.8GHz + 1.4GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 652. About AU$590 (16GB) or AU$650 (128GB).

Software Security and productivity features Rapid Security Patching : BlackBerry has a record of being the quickest to deliver security patches, setting the bar in incident response and patch management to protect your device from malicious threats. DTEK by BlackBerry App : Enables users to automatically monitor their OS and apps to know when their privacy could be at risk and to take action to improve it. The DTEK app also monitors applications and notifies you when someone is: taking pictures or videos without your knowledge, turning your microphone on, sending a text message, or accessing your contacts or location. Hardware Root of Trust : BlackBerry uses a proprietary technique that adds security from the start, allowing for the tracking, verification and provisioning of the DTEK60. Secure Boot Process : Starting with the root of trust, each stage of DTEK60's secure boot chain must first verify that the next component is fully intact before proceeding, ensuring your device has not been tampered with since the last restart. Android OS hardening : BlackBerry provides additional security patches, improves upon Android's native Address Space Layout Randomization and reduces the number of system applications and services running with elevated permissions. This makes it more difficult for attackers to compromise the OS. FIPS 140-2 Compliant Full Disk Encryption : Protects your private information, like pictures or bank information, from being stolen if you were to lose your phone. Android for Work and Google Play for Work : Allows for fast, simple and secure integration with an enterprise environment as well as easy access to numerous rich business and IT-managed apps. Full Enterprise Mobility Management Support : DTEK60 supports BlackBerry's powerful suite of EMM applications and secure productivity solutions, including: WatchDox by BlackBerry for secure file-sharing, Good Work for business-class email and collaboration tools, Strong Authentication by BlackBerry as a VPN solution, SecuSUITE for Enterprise for secure voice and instant messaging communication, BBM Protected for encrypted messaging and BES12 for secure cross-platform management. Pricing and competition Daily usage experiences and conclusion. A couple of months ago when. BlackBerry announced it was ending internal hardware development, I read many stories stating there would be no more BlackBerry hardware and thought the company would never release another BlackBerry-branded phone. There was some misunderstanding and confusion with those reports and with the BlackBerry DTEK60 we see BlackBerry branding on a high end smartphone launched at a very reasonable price.. While BlackBerry will no longer be designing the hardware from the ground up, it did work closely with TCL to modify a reference design for its customers. I purchased a DTEK60 early last week and after about 10 days I am so impressed with the hardware and software that I plan to keep the device as my primary Android smartphone.. Previous BlackBerry flagships came at a high price with the BlackBerry Priv launching at $699 last year. The new BlackBerry DTEK60 is available now for just $499 and is one of the least expensive flagship phones you can purchase today, while offering enhanced productivity and efficiency elements in a sleek form factor.. If you look at the specs above, it matches what we see today from other Android flagships in nearly every way. Water resistance would be great and make the DTEK60 even more compelling for the enterprise, but at $499 it is still an excellent choice.. My first thought when I took the BlackBerry DTEK60 out of the box was that Samsung must have released a BlackBerry device. The DTEK60 has front and rear glass panels with a metal frame and dual beveled edges between the glass panels. It looks and feels awesome in the hand and I'm having a tough time believing this is a BlackBerry device that only costs $500.. Advertising photos may not do this device justice as it truly is an elegant looking classy device that is perfect for the office. You get that traditional BlackBerry red LED and a handful of high end specifications in an awesome looking device.. The back glass panel is interesting in that it rests on a dark gray back with the BlackBerry logo embedded in it. Unlike the fingerprint magnet of the Galaxy S7 and other glass back phones, the back of the DTEK60 stays virtually free of fingerprints with regular usage. After just a few days, there were several scratches along the lower half of the back. These were actually deep enough to be felt with a finger run across the scratches. If you buy the DTEK60, I recommend using the soft shell back or another case to prevent scratching.. There is a 5.5 inch 2K display on the front with minimal side bezels and reasonable top and bottom bezels. There are dual stereo speakers at the extreme top and bottom of the phone with speaker grill openings on the front and back. Thus, you can easily hear audio content with the phone face up or face down.. I played the same song on the stereo speakers of the iPhone 7 Plus, Huawei Mate 9, and BlackBerry DTEK60. The DTEK60 was louder and clearer than either of these two other flagship phones.. There's an eight megapixel selfie shooter above the display with a dedicated LED flash for lighting up those selfies.. The display has a bit of curvature in the glass on either side, 2.5D, with an S7 Edge-esque button that can be swiped from either the right or left side of the phone. This Productivity Tab gives you quick access to your calendar, unread messages, tasks, and favorite contacts and serves as one element of efficiency on the DTEK60.. The power button and SIM card/microSD card slot are found on the upper left. The volume button is found on the upper right with a round convenience key centered on the right side. You can customize the purpose of this button and I have mine set to launch Google Now.. BlackBerry DTEK60 full review: in pictur... 1 - 5 of 16. Similar to the HTC 10, you can also select the option to have your microSD storage card function as internal storage, called adoptable storage. You can also just choose to use it as most other Androids with external storage for media and other large files.. There's a USB Type-C port off to the right side of the bottom with a microphone opening on the left side. A standard 3.5mm headphone jack and another mic opening are found on the top.. There is a 21 megapixel Sony IMX230 Exmor sensor on the back with a dual LED flash adjacent to it. Centered below the camera is a rear fingerprint scanner, a first for a BlackBerry Android device and something it needed to advertise security.. I took some comparison photos with the BlackBerry DTEK60, Apple iPhone 7 Plus, and Huawei Mate 9 and put the full resolution images in a. The DTEK60 did well, but it's not going to challenge the Google Pixel or Galaxy S7 as the best camera available.. The 3,000 mAh battery has been getting me through most of a day, but when I take lots of photos and spend time with the display on it is not lasting me as long as the iPhone 7 Plus or Huawei Mate 9. Thankfully, the DTEK60 supports the standard Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging technology to top off quickly.. I'm using the DTEK60 on T-Mobile and have full WiFi Calling and VoLTE support right out of the box too.. The BlackBerry DTEK60 is the second BlackBerry-branded handset that was produced from a reference design. The DTEK60 is based on the TCL 950, but with a 2K display instead of a 1080p variant and 32GB of internal storage instead of 64GB. The special sauce that is added comes in the form of BlackBerry software integrated into the Android operating system.. One reason I initially purchased a. Lenovo Moto Z was due to the stock Android implementation. Thankfully, we see that same stock Android experience on the DTEK60. There is no carrier bloatware as this is a GSM unlocked phone, but there are some BlackBerry apps that are provided to add value to the experience.. BlackBerry includes the BlackBerry Keyboard, BlackBerry Hub, BlackBerry Calendar, Contacts by BlackBerry, Notes by BlackBerry, Tasks by BlackBerry, BlackBerry Camera, BBM, DTEK by BlackBerry, BlackBerry Device Search, BlackBerry Launcher, BlackBerry Services, BlackBerry Help, BlackBerry Password Keeper, Microsoft exFAT Technology for BlackBerry, and BlackBerry Content Transfer.. The BlackBerry DTEK60 launched with Android Marshmallow and I trust that it will eventually received the Android 7.0 Nougat update as well. BlackBerry hasn't yet provided a timeline for updating the DTEK60.. Like the Apple iPhone, Google Pixel, and Moto Z, the BlackBerry DTEK60 supports visual voicemail right in the dialer app. You no longer need to download and install your carrier visual voicemail application.. A major benefit of having a stock Android device with BlackBerry controlling the customization experience is that BlackBerry can provide updates quickly. phenomenal record of providing monthly Android security updates and even though I just bought the phone last week I received the November Android security update yesterday.. Security and productivity features advertised by BlackBerry include:. The GSM unlocked BlackBerry DTEK60 is available for $499 USD ($650 CDN, €579 and £475). The 32GB 5.5 inch iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL both start at $769 and have no additional storage capacity. The Moto Z and HTC 10 are both priced at $699, but the HTC 10 only has a 5.2 inch display.. With my misunderstanding that BlackBerry was done with hardware, I thought the BlackBerry Passport was going to be my last BlackBerry purchase. It turns out that BlackBerry is still working with hardware partners to bring new devices to market with BlackBerry focusing on an enhanced software experience to provide security and productivity to customers. The DTEK60 packs in flagship specs, enhanced BlackBerry services, and is priced $200 to $300 less than competing 5.5 inch smartphones.. The DTEK60 would be nearly perfect with some kind of water resistance, even a nano coating to prevent damage from splashes. Hopefully we see this capability in a future BlackBerry handset.. The device is a pleasure to hold, the speakers are loud and clear, the BlackBerry keyboard is fast and accurate, and the BlackBerry Hub helps me maintain a centralized communications center for better efficiency in my daily routine.. For $499, I can recommend the DTEK60 just based on its specifications alone. Add in the BlackBerry software, BlackBerry committment and track record of fast security updates, and compelling dual glass and metal frame hardware design and it's easy to see why the BlackBerry DTEK60 is a winner..

It’s no secret BlackBerry’s had a tough time of it in the smartphone market recently. Despite having great security software and having migrated from its less-than-popular BlackBerry 10 OS to Android, the company’s phones have continued to play second fiddle to the likes of Samsung and Apple.. That’s why I didn’t expect much from the charismatically named BlackBerry DTEK60. After all, it is, on paper, yet another pretty dull Android phone aimed at the £400-500 target being peppered by numerous other handsets, such as the HTC 10 Evo and OnePlus 3T .. However, I can confirm that my opening fears were misguided. The DTEK60 is one of the best BlackBerry phones to date and an ideal choice for any security-conscious buyer.. Video: Best Smartphone 2016: What’s the no.1 phone right now?. Smartphone connoisseurs may get a sense of déjà vu when looking at the DTEK60 – and for good reason. The phone is based on a reference design from Chinese firm TCL, which has made handsets for numerous other companies this year. As consequence it looks all but identical to the Alcatel Idol 4S and Vodafone Smart Platinum 7 , outside of the BlackBerry logo emblazoned upon its back.. The similarities are a blessing and a curse. The glass front and back faces look nice but, like the 4S and Platinum 7, they’re fingerprint and scratch magnets and quickly become slippy to hold in wet weather, which is a problem in the regularly moist British climate.. However, these issues are counterbalanced by the intelligent placement of the DTEK60’s rear fingerprint scanner and useful “Convenience” key. The fingerprint scanner sits just below the DTEK60’s rear camera sensor, which protrudes noticeably from the phone’s back. I’ve always prefered a back-facing placement for fingerprint scanners over front-facing ones, such as those on the Galaxy S7 and HTC 10 , which require you to awkwardly rejig the way you naturally hold a handset. The scanner’s also suitably fast and makes it quick and easy to unlock the DTEK60, or approve certain actions such as NFC and in-app payments.. The Convenience key sits in the middle of the phone’s right-hand side – the same position occupied by the Alcatel Idol 4S’s “Boom” button. Unlike the Boom button, which tried and failed to improve the phone’s audio quality, the DTEK60’s Convenience button is customisable and lets you choose what action you’d like it to take. You can set it to do everything from opening applications to switching a setting on or off. This sounds small, but I found it very useful as a quick way to mute the phone.. The 32GB of built-in storage is pretty par for the course and those who wish to can add another 2TB using the DTEK60’s microSD card slot.. The 5.5-inch AMOLED display isn’t the best I’ve ever seen, but for the money it’s more than good enough and easily beats those on pretty much every other £400-500 phone I’ve tested on quality, outside of the OnePlus 3T’s..

The 2,560 x 1,440-pixel Quad HD resolution gives it a super-high 534ppi (pixels per inch) density, making it all but impossible to discern individual pixels. In short, the screen is more than good enough for most regular users.. My only minor quibbles are that whites aren’t quite as clean as I’d like, and the maximum brightness isn’t quite high enough. This means that the phone can become tricky to use in bright light, though being fair to BlackBerry this is an issue on most of the phones I test.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc.

FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $450 Buy. $365 Buy.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. As part of its calendar Q3 earnings call,. announced that is would no longer be manufacturing BlackBerry smartphones. The hardware-focused game was over and the future would be in software.. today's launch of the new DTEK60 BlackBerry. It's awkward but it's not contradicting the previous statement. is a good illustration of where BlackBerry sees its smartphone future. The Android manufacturer ecosystem is one that is becoming a commodity market for all but the highest-specification handsets at the top end. Margins are smaller, and with price as a key battleground the real value is found elsewhere in the system.. BlackBerry does not have a volume of sales or significant market share on its side to help bring in enough revenue with custom hardware. When there are off-the-shelf reference designs to use, and your real power is software, the decision is clear. Go with reference designs and use the software to differentiate.. BlackBerry is not hiding this approach,. it is open and upfront when you ask. Industry watchers who know their reference designs will spot the heritage of TCL's handset in this new model, but for the consumer in the street or the Enterprise buyer looking for a volume-based rollout of devices, they will simply see the name BlackBerry, recognise the branding, and consider the Android-powered DTEK60.. Once more, Blackberry has released a new Android device ticks all the boxes for competency. Note down the features you'd expect for an Android device priced at $499 SIM-free and you'll be close to the DTEK60's specifications. There's a QuadHD resolution screen measuring a 5.5 inches on the diagonal. It's using AMOLED technology so has a vibrancy and pop to the colours while remaining readable.. The smartphone obsession for thinness is also present, with the DTEK60 measuring 6.99 mm (although this ignores the extra millimeters provided by the camera lens bulge). Inside the case is a Qualcomm SnapDragon 820, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage - the DTEK60 is only offered in one storage size with any extra storage requirements passed over to the microSD slot. As with most new Android devices at the higher price points, connectivity and charging is provided by USB-C, and audiophiles will be happy to see that the 3.5mm headphone jack is retained.. There's nothing in the hardware that sets the world alight, but neither are there any major mis-steps. You've seen all of this before, in similar sized packages, at a similar price point. The platform is competent and capable, the real value, the sizzle for the sales team, should be found in the software.. This is BlackBerry's third Android handset, although some elements of the Android software package have been available for third-party handsets for a longer period.. Central to the DTEK60 (and BlackBerry's vision of communications software) is the BlackBerry Hub. Bringing in alerts and notifications from all your messaging apps as well as social networks and team organisational software such as Slack. One glance at the screens and you'll seen the BlackBerry lineage back to the original messaging devices from the Canadian company. The Hub offers a consistent interface between email, Facebook, Twitter, and countless other applications. Think of it as a super-notifications system with a preview of your messages and you'll get the idea.. Shoehorning all of the different types of notifications and messages into a consistent interface is not easy, and BlackBerry's engineers have sacrificed some flexibility and formatting options to achieve that goal. Hub has moved beyond handing multiple email accounts and BBM chats (which it is rather good at), and how the Hub copes with. this is an area that I'll be looking at during a full review.. The DTEK60 also ships with the rest of BlackBerry's PIM suite, including its own Calendar and Contacts Book software, and the ubiquitous BlackBerry Messenger.. If you were to boil down the brand, its essence would be rapid messaging (which has evolved into the Hub) and a secure environment. The latter is the biggest selling point of the DTEK60. From the unique security keys included in the manufacturing process to prevent device counterfeiting and a secure bootloader that checks the various systems as the handset is powered up, to the fingerprint reader (a first on BlackBerry hardware) and the constant monitoring the DTEK app does to protect your information from being accessed by other applications without your permission; the DTEK60 promotes itself as a 'secure smartphone'.. Many of these changes are invisible to the end-user, as they should be, but it's the other area of security that BlackBerry promises that sets the machine apart from many. The promise to rush the Android security updates to the handsets as soon as they are released by Google. SIM-free handsets supplied directly by BlackBerry will pick these up direct, while those sold through carriers around the world will need to wait for carrier certification, but there are clear agreements between BlackBerry and the carriers that security patches will be passed through with haste.. The DTEK60 is a clear representation of where BlackBerry's future lies. It will continue to leverage a strong brand name and corporate values through software. The Android application software here matches that of the PRIV and the DTEK50, so has been in use for some time and is stable. The deeper changes to Android to provide a secure space offers Blackberry a slight advantage over other handsets using vanilla Android, but Google could add in similar features to later builds of Android.. What BlackBerry offers the enterprise market is that level of security right now, and the ability to stay on top of security issues for the lifetime of a device. The DTEK60, with a touch more power and potential than the DTEK50, is aimed at the enterprise market as a corporate device.. The DTEK60 is available to individual users, but you should be aware of the reference design nature of the handset. The value in this handset is in the software. and being part of the company's cloud-based product. BlackBerry's historical prowess as a manufacturer gives it the edge when software and hardware is combined, but be in no doubt the DTEK60 transitions the user and the company from hardware-first to software-first.. Forbes Tech will be taking the DTEK 60 on an extended review to find out the benefits of Blackberry's new licensing model and Android software updates..

BlackBerry’s latest smartphone embraces Android and all the best bits from the.... Reports that BlackBerry is out the smartphone game are misleading – outsourcing design doesn’t mean the company is down and out. The DTEK60 proves the brand can still turn out a high-end, secure phone. Here is our BlackBerry DTEK60 review. BlackBerry’s latest smartphone embraces Android and all the best bits from the past. 5.5in 2560 x 1440 AMOLED touchscreen, 534ppi. Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices. BlackBerry DTEK60 review: Price and where to buy. BlackBerry DTEK60 review: Design and build. BlackBerry DTEK60 review: Specs, hardware and performance. When BlackBerry released the DTEK50, its second Android smartphone, in August 2016, it called it ‘the world’s most secure Android smartphone’. What, then, does that make this, the higher-spec DTEK60, BlackBerry’s most premium smartphone to date? Pretty darn secure, as it happens. This phone is that and a surprising amount more, and proof that the company now outsourcing its hardware design isn’t all that bad.. This is a flagship smartphone aimed, as ever, at the enterprise and business, but thankfully one we can recommend to you as a consumer also. The DTEK60 is available now from Amazon or. direct from BlackBerry in the UK for £475. It is also on sale for the same price, SIM free and unlocked from Carphone Warehouse .. We should all accept this is a smartphone from BlackBerry Mk 2. While it still sells three smartphones with physical keyboards at the time of writing, the company is now moving to become better positioned in the Android market and away from its roots. This move started with the Priv ,. moved into full touchscreen with the DTEK50. and now arrives at this, the slick, business-like DTEK60.. While BlackBerry might struggle with product names these days the DTEK60 is an attractively designed smartphone. Because BlackBerry has handed over design to its partner TCL, the phone bears incredibly close resemblance to both the Alcatel Idol 4s and the Vodafone Smart Platinum 7 .. It’s futile to be annoyed by this; it’s a solid, slim and uniform smartphone design that will appeal to many in its own understated way, with the familiar silver BlackBerry logo sitting beneath the hard see-through plastic back. Plastic it may be, but premium it remains.. The phone is an ideal weight for an oft-unwieldy 5.5in screen size of smartphone, at 165g (for comparison, that’s 18g heavier than an iPhone 6s ). The screen has thin bezels on the left and right sides, but the slightly protruding silver edges of the device mean it isn’t hard to hold. The left edge has the power/lock button just above the SIM and microSD card tray, while the right side has the volume rocker and BlackBerry’s convenience key, which we will discuss later.. Although not too large a phone to hold at 153.9 x 75.4 x 7mm, what makes it slippery and droppable is its shiny back. It feels like glass but is actually a hardened plastic, and we dropped the device once thanks to this, scratching it somewhat. The silver edging on the DTEK60 is attractive, broken only on the top for the headphone jack and the USB-C port and mic on the bottom. Also at the top and bottom are the excellently subtle front facing speakers that also allow sound out from the back, stopping the chassis rattling at louder volumes. The camera bump on the rear protrudes just above a circular fingerprint sensor.. This means the device is a pleasing step up in build quality compared to the plastic and rubber of the DTEK50. It represents BlackBerry aspiring to produce a product that is as premium as its classic phones of old while embracing a full touch, Android operating system. Where the DTEK50 felt like an Android pretending to be a BlackBerry, the DTEK60’s high end materials remind us of the glory days of the Bold and the Curve while simultaneously being unmistakably Android.. The DTEK60 improves on the DTEK50 in specs as well as looks. It has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor, the same one found in the US Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and the OnePlus 3. It pairs that with 4GB RAM and an Adreno 30 GPU. It runs very smoothly, but still a touch slower than those two phones.. Frustratingly, despite our best efforts, we could not run our usual Geekbench and GFXBench benchmark tests on the handset, presented as we were with error messages after many attempts. However we can confidently say that while this is a flagship phone with excellent performance, it isn’t as zippy in every day use when compared to the S7 edge, OnePlus 3 or iPhone 7. Sometimes with many apps open, the transitions slow down slightly between screens and app load times are longer. It’s not a major problem, but it is noticeable.. On board storage is set at 32GB but the microSD card slot allows up to 256GB. This can be done relatively cheaply with the best microSD cards on the market .. With that boost it’ll be more than enough to carry around your entire music collection on the integrated Google Play Music or another service like Spotify .. We welcome an Android BlackBerry with high-end specs; it feels long overdue in this form factor, although the Priv’s Snapdragon 808 processor when it was released in November 2015 was acceptably high-end. It’s enough to satisfy the BlackBerry users among us who were resistant to the transition to an all-touch handset (we do love a good physical keyboard).. The screen is a 5.5in scratch and smudge resistant quad HD AMOLED display. The smudge resistant part is actually accurate too; although this is a slippy phone, we weren’t too put off by inevitable fingerprints when compared to other glass phones – but you’ll still notice them from time to time. The pixel density of the 2560 x 1440 resolution display is 534ppi.. In real world terms, it looks really good and only the pickiest of techies will have any complaints. As it is AMOLED, black colours display very nicely and actually use less battery power. Colours don’t stand out quite as vividly as on handsets like the OnePlus 3 (which also has an AMOLED display) but the DTEK60 actually reproduces onscreen colours more accurately in this way.. When we first started using the DTEK60 we felt like the screen was almost too sensitive. Often we would scroll through the app tray and accidentally select an app. Oddly, this didn’t happen much after the first two days and we had no complaints.. This is the first ever BlackBerry handset to feature a fingerprint scanner, which is welcome given it has been three years since the iPhone 5s. It’s on the back of the phone below the camera, where BlackBerry claims (as do other manufacturers) that your finger naturally falls when you pick up the device. This isn’t entirely accurate and it’s down to personal preference, but we still think having the sensor on the bottom front of the phone is more convenient. You might want to give it a go in store before you buy, but we found it to be quite accurate, unlocking first time most of the time. It is also important for the secure minded DTEK60 to have added this extra layer of security to the hardware.. Like the recent DTEK50, there’s a so-called convenience key on the right edge of the phone that you can assign one specific task to, for example new text message, camera, settings and so on. We still think it’s a tad odd to have such a feature given all of the options are an app tap away, but you might find a use for it.. BlackBerry claims you’ll get 24 hours of mixed use from the 3,000mAh non-removable battery. We can say reasonably confidently that this is an over-estimate, which is a shame given BlackBerry’s good track record for battery life. What is welcome here is Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging with the included wall charger, a happy side effect of the USB-C port. It can charge the DTEK60 in just over an hour from very low battery and is very convenient.. We used the phone constantly one day after taking it off charge at 12pm, using the camera, Google Maps, Trip Advisor and other GPS based apps while on holiday in Poland. The battery was dead by 1am, so it gave us a good 13 hours under quite heavy use. This will be adequate for most during a full working day, but obviously it is well below 24 hours.. The rear camera of the DTEK60 boasts a 21Mp auto-focus lens with f.2/0 aperture and a dual-LED flash. It can also record video at many different levels including 4K at up to 30fps. We used the camera extensively in Poland with some pleasing results; images are sharp and the lens copes well in low light, though the images produced from the Samsung Galaxy S7 are still best in class .. The front facing camera is a modest 8Mp, but it’s good to see an LED flash for those selfie-inclined, or if you want to shoot a Blair Witch Project-style monologue.. It’s not always the case that we have to concentrate so much on the software section of a review, but this is an exception. The DTEK60 ships with Android Marshmallow 6.0, with no clear indication as to if and when the update to Nougat 7.0 will be available. The decision here to with basically stock Android is welcome to us; unless you prefer the skins of the Samsung Galaxy or Sony Xperia series, we think you’ll enjoy it too. Much like the HTC 10 before it, the DTEK60 eschews its own photo gallery for Google Photos, and Google software is front and centre, from Gmail to the prompt to open Google Play Music when you plug in your headphones (you get in-ear ‘phones included in the box).. There are small differences to the Android experience but they are changeable. For example, we found the text displayed quite small compared to other devices, but you can make it bigger (up to ‘Huge’ in fact), and the recent apps by default display in a confusing mosaic but you can put it to the regular Rolodex mode in Settings.. What we also like is the inclusion of BlackBerry Hub, an app carried over to this Android version from BlackBerry’s BB10 OS. It groups all your notifications in one place and is a portal to all those apps. It’s great to help you blast through email or different social posts, but we like the little touches like pinching the exhaustive list of notifications to just display the unread ones. Little tweaks like this help you get stuff done and are echoes of the productivity-minded BlackBerry handsets of the last fifteen years.. Speaking of productivity, there’s even an optional productivity tab, an (if on) ever-present thin grey tab on the right of the screen. Swipe it to the left, and it gives you your calendar, messages, tasks and contacts. It’s really useful, but we kept forgetting it was there. One issue too is that on certain webpages it covers text that reaches the edge of the page – if this happens though, you can change the transparency of the slim bar. It’s little touches like this that show that BlackBerry has thought long and hard about the use cases for this phone for the consumer and the business user, and the balance it manages to strike is spot on.. The BlackBerry Intelligent Keyboard is also part of the software, with various intelligent gestures to select predictive text, delete words and more. However, this is a port of the touch sensitive physical keyboard of the BlackBerry Passport ,. and it simply works better on that phone. We prefer the also pre-installed Google Keyboard. Here are some Android keyboard alternatives .. Where the DTEK60 tries to differentiate is in the security of the device. Pleasingly, there is little for the user to do to implement these features. The Android software here has access to quicker security patching, with BlackBerry promising the latest security updates to your phone before anyone else, and at increased regularity. We received an update while using the phone, so this claim seems legitimate.. It’s more aimed at the enterprise user, but BlackBerry also impressively offers securer options for file sharing ( WatchDox ), email and collaboration ( Good Work ) and VPN access on top of its encrypted BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) service. BBM is a consumer service and the others are available to download as an individual, but their full power and use is intended for IT managers who wish to supply their employees with (BlackBerry hopes) a fleet of DTEK60s.. But, whether a consumer or a business user, your DTEK60 establishes a hardware root of trust the first time you boot up the phone. This automatically adds security keys to the processor of your device that then track and verify its use to better encrypt your data. BlackBerry doesn’t explain exactly how this happens in the marketing materials, but as a consumer this is undoubtedly the most secure Android phone you can get. And if that’s important to you, it’s one of the few hardware manufacturers that are putting a focus on it as opposed to the usual software security focus of secure messaging apps like Signal .. The DTEK name is present in its own app as well, and is the most accessible way to take a broad view of your device's security. You get see a gauge of how secure your phone is, and the app prompts you on how to improve it, from adding a fingerprint unlock to editing the permissions of certain third party apps. It’s a bit fiddly at times and the learning curve could be steep depending on your existing knowledge, but if security is important to you its one of the best apps out there. Unlike other BlackBerry apps, this is only available on Android-running BlackBerry hardware.. 5.5in 2560 x 1440 AMOLED touchscreen, 534ppi. 21Mp main camera, dual-LED flash, support for 4K videos at 30fps. 153.9 x 75.4 x 7 mm. 5.5in 2560 x 1440 AMOLED touchscreen, 534ppi. 21Mp main camera, dual-LED flash, support for 4K videos at 30fps. 153.9 x 75.4 x 7 mm. For the first time in a while, this is a BlackBerry we can recommend to the individual consumer. It is also a business device, but the flexibility of Android means it is versatile enough to be moulded to the needs of both. It marries the Android operating system with robust, easy to use security features and slick design, all for under £500.. It doesn’t have the brand clout of an iPhone or the curved edges of a Samsung Galaxy, but with its admittedly quite straight-faced take on the modern smartphone BlackBerry has just – just – turned a corner.

The DTEK60 mixes excellent specs with a gorgeous design and super-secure software, to effortlessly claim the title of BlackBerry's best touchscreen smartphone to date, and earn its place as one of the best Android phones of 2016.. Key features BlackBerry’s first finger scanner High-end specs A focus on security Design and display Bright, high-quality QHD screen Metal frame and slippery plastic rear panel Handy convenience key. Reports of BlackBerry's demise have clearly been exaggerated, as the business-focused phone maker has just released another high-end Android smartphone, despite claims that it was moving away from hardware towards software.. While the DTEK60 is indeed a new device bearing the BlackBerry name, the production has been outsourced to Chinese firm TCL, which also works with the likes of Alcatel and Vodafone.. It's packing a 5.5-inch QHD screen, a Snapdragon 820 chipset, 4GB of RAM, a fingerprint scanner and 21MP main camera. That’s a strong assortment of specs, and the DTEK60 aims to stand out further by offering a suite of security-oriented apps and features which, according to BlackBerry, make this one of the most secure phones money can buy.. That’s a good thing too, because at $499 (£475, around AU$650) the sheer strength of specs may not be enough to compete with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and HTC 10 .. Weight : 165g Dimensions : 153.9 x 75.4 x 7 mm OS : Android 6.0 Screen size : 5.5-inch Resolution : 1440 x 2560 CPU : Snapdragon 820 RAM : 4GB Storage : 32GB Battery : 3,000mAh Rear camera : 21MP Front camera : 8MP. With BlackBerry essentially handing over design and construction duties to hardware partner TCL, the DTEK60 feels more like a traditional Android smartphone that any other device to bear the famous BlackBerry logo – including the Priv and DTEK50 , both of which also run Android.. BlackBerry is clearly gunning for the same sector of the market that laps up phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Google Pixel XL , and it shows in the core design and feature list of the DTEK60.. There's no physical keyboard here – BlackBerry is slowly abandoning the one feature that truly set its phones apart from the competition – and in its place we have a roomy, 1440 x 2560 AMOLED screen which measures 5.5-inches from corner to corner.. Inside the phone there's a Snapdragon 820 processor – the same tech that can be found in flagship devices such as the Galaxy S7, Xiaomi Mi5 and LG G5 – as well as 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.. The presence of a microSD card slot means you can add in more memory if you wish. NFC is also included, so you can make contactless payments via Android Pay.. For such a security-centric company it's perhaps surprising that BlackBerry hasn't included a fingerprint scanner on any of its previous phones. There's one on the DTEK60, and the good news is that it's fast, responsive and permits users to unlock the device with a single touch of their digit.. Like so many Android handsets, the DTEK60 has its scanner located on the rear of the device, where your finger naturally lies when you hold it in your hand.. Above the scanner there's a considerable camera bump, which contains the 21MP snapper. It's rocking phase detection autofocus and a dual-tone LED flash, but sadly lacks optical image stabilization. The front-facing camera is an 8MP, fixed focus variant and is perfect for selfies thanks to its LED flash.. While the DTEK60 is running a largely stock version of Android 6.0 – which means it's close to the user experience you'd get from a Nexus (or Pixel ) device – it does come with some neat extras which focus on business users and general security, including the DTEK app, which monitors the handset and its running applications, warning you of potential risks and weaknesses.. A 3000mAh battery keeps things ticking over and provides enough stamina to last an entire day. Quick Charge support means you can completely fill the battery from empty in just over an hour, or alternatively you can grab a few hours of battery life by hooking it up for a 15-minute charge.. At 6.99mm, the DTEK60 is the thinnest BlackBerry yet. The front of the phone is covered in 2.5D glass, while the rear features hardened plastic and the familiar BlackBerry logo. You'll also find the fingerprint scanner and 21MP camera on the back, the latter of which protrudes quite dramatically from the body of the device.. Around the edges there's a metal frame with neatly beveled edges, as well as the power button on the left-hand side, and volume rocker and "convenience button" on the right.. On the topic of the power button, we think it's in an odd place – the top corner of the left edge – and we repeatedly found ourselves stabbing the convenience key instead, a possible throwback to the days when we owned a Sony Xperia.. Muscle memory aside, there's no doubting that the button's positioning is weird – but not disastrous, as you can use the fingerprint scanner to wake the phone from sleep. On the top of the DTEK60 there's the 3.5mm headphone socket and on the bottom end the USB Type-C port.. Despite substituting tempered glass for plastic on its rear, the DTEK60 is still quite a slippery beast. During the review period, our handset actually slid right off the desk and onto the hard floor, so we'd recommend getting a case early on.. On the positive side, the phone survived this heart-stopping fall with just a few nicks on the corners, so it's clearly solidly built – which is impressive for such a svelte device.. It may be made by an external company, but there's still plenty of BlackBerry's DNA in the design of the DTEK60. The curves remind us of the iconic Bold series, while the convenience key will be instantly familiar to long-time supporters of the brand.. You can assign it different roles – we use it to instantly launch Google Now, for example – and after a few days in the company of the DTEK60 we found ourselves wishing that more phones boasted such a button. Being able to instantly launch an oft-used app from any screen is a lot more useful than it might sound on paper.. For a company which for many years forced its users to stare at awkward landscape-oriented displays, BlackBerry has certainly embraced the big-screen mobile revolution. The 5.5-inch panel on the DTEK60 has a pin-sharp resolution of 1440 x 2560, which gives it a pixel density of 534ppi.. Thanks to the fact that it's an AMOLED screen, colors look bright and punchy, while overall contrast is striking. While Samsung fans are used to such visual opulence and we dare say the panel on the S7 is superior, this is arguably the best display to ever grace a BlackBerry device..

The BlackBerry DTEK60 is the most powerful and elegant BlackBerry device released. It stands out from other Android smartphones with key functions and features that enhance efficiency and improve productivity.. for Smartphones and Cell Phones. | November 14, 2016 -- 12:47 GMT (20:47 GMT+08:00). Security : The full list of enhanced BlackBerry security features can be seen in my full review and includes rapid security updates, Android OS hardening, and more. BlackBerry Hub : The Hub provides a centralized communications system that lets you manage most of your forms of contact within one interface. Some apps, such as Facebook, still force you out of the Hub, but I've been able to save lots of time working just within the Hub. Convenience key : The right side hardware button can be customized to launch an app or perform a function you select. Mine is set to Google Now, which gives me quicker access to this screen than I could get by swiping on a Pixel. Swipe up options : BlackBerry gives you a few ways to gain quick access to your apps or information. A swipe up from the center bottom home button gives you the option to swipe to the left, center, or right to launch apps or utilities you select. I'm using the default BlackBerry device search, phone dialer, and Hub options on the DTEK60. Deep notification functionality : While Android 7 Nougat provides more functionality in the notification area, BlackBerry Hub gives you even more options. For example, you can reply to, snooze, or delete individual emails. Productivity tab : Similar to the Galaxy S7 Edge side panels, BlackBerry gives you a tab you can swipe from the right or left to access you calendar, unread messages, tasks, and favorite contacts. It's a very efficient way to view and access your key information. BlackBerry keyboard : There are some powerful software keyboard options available on the Android platform. The BlackBerry keyboard brings the best from years of BlackBerry hardware QWERTY keyboards to the DTEK60. Stock Android experience and no bloatware : Similar to the Lenovo Moto phones, BlackBerry brings a stock Android experience to Android. It's refreshing to have a device free of bloatware and unecessary apps and utilities. Adoptable external storage : While Android 6.0 Marshmallow provided support to designate your external microSD storage card as internal storage, so far we have only seen HTC and Lenovo provide this functionality. BlackBerry also includes this capability and if you enable this option then the microSD card is only usable within the device, making the card more secure. Home screen shortcuts : While Android supports various widgets and home screen app shortcuts, BlackBerry takes things further with useful shortcuts. These include direct message composition, device utilities, media play options, set or view alarms, and many more.. After a couple of weeks with the new BlackBerry DTEK60, see my full review , it's clear that BlackBerry offers a powerful smartphone for the enterprise user at a value price.. I spend less time managing email, I'm able to work within the BlackBerry Hub rather than jumping in and out of different apps, I can quickly check my calendar, tasks, and unread messages while continuing to work with my apps, and perform many other functions much more effectively than I can with other Android smartphones.. Here are 10 reasons the BlackBerry DTEK60 is good for business:. BlackBerry DTEK60 full review: in pictur... 1 - 5 of 16. There are many great Android smartphones available today, ranging in price from $300 to $900+ and I've had the opportunity to test many of them. I ordered the DTEK60 figuring I would test it out and return it. However, because of the items listed above and a few other reasons (loud stereo speakers, great form factor, 3.5mm headset jack) I am keeping this $500 smartphone.. With flagship specifications and a number of BlackBerry enhancements, it's tough to beat the $499 price and value of the BlackBerry DTEK60.. Samsung, UCSF launch app to monitor your stress levels.

BlackBerry DTEK60 review: The best of BlackBerry's secure Android offerings. DTEK60 combines Android flagship hardware with BlackBerry's secure Android software.. Back in 2007 when I started here at CrackBerry, I never imagined that one day I would be writing about BlackBerry's third Android device being available, but here we are. The DTEK60 has arrived, and after having spent some time with the device, it's time to take a look beyond our initial hands-on and see how the DTEK60 stands up to everyday use.. The DTEK60 is the latest in BlackBerry's line of secure Android smartphones combining best-in-class security and flagship specs but at a lower price tier than most flagship phones. It's a complete package that is great for enterprises and organizations looking to deploy devices but can also be recommended to anyone looking to move into flagship hardware without breaking the bank.. Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 out of the box. Still no RGB LED, only red. Bigger battery would have been appreciated. As I noted in my initial hands-on and I'm sure many DTEK60 owners will now tell you, no amount of photos really do the DTEK60 justice, especially if you're already familiar with seeing the DTEK50. Aside from the weight of the device, the design of the DTEK60 is going to be one of the first things you notice, and that's a good thing. It looks elegant and has a classy premium feel to it.. It looks elegant and has a classy premium feel to it.. Speaking of the weight of the DTEK60, it comes in at 165g thanks to all the glass associated with the device, but the weight is something that I believe adds to the premium feel overall. On the face of the DTEK60 is that 5.5-Inch display that looks curved but is all a bit of an illusion. Once you pick the DTEK60 up and take a closer look, you'll realize it's not really curved, but instead the scratch and smudge resistant display drapes down ever so slightly on the sides to give the visual appearance of being curved.. That 5.5-Inch display is an AMOLED panel with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 which equals out to 534PPI. At its full brightness, it's one of brightest displays I can recall ever having been put in a BlackBerry, and it's certainly brighter than that of the BlackBerry Priv, something I know a lot of folks were wondering about. Colors are bight and vivid, blacks are nice and deep, and even when using a VR headset coupled with some cardboard apps, the display looks great. Overall, there's not a lot to complain about here, but it's not a real review unless I find something, and in the case of DTEK60, that would be how it looks outdoors in direct sunlight. It's a bit rough to see unless the brightness is jacked up and well, that's a battery killer.. Venturing around the rest of the hardware, the front of the DTEK60 is also where you will find that red LED that will blink at you with new notifications, instead of the white LED found on the DTEK50. Honestly, I grew accustomed to the white on the DTEK50, but the red on the DTEK60 is certainly welcome. Still, it's no RGB, which is unfortunate but not a HUGE deal. If selfies are your thing, the front is also where you will find the 8MP fixed focus camera which supports 1080p video recording at 30 fps and has a selfie flash to light up your wonderful face. In my testing, the front-facing camera was the same as that found on the DTEK50, meaning it's entirely capable and it's miles above the front-facing camera found on the Priv.. The front of the DTEK60 is also where you will find that red LED that will blink at you with new notifications.. Start making your way around the DTEK60 and on the right-hand side is where you have your volume up and down rockers as well as your convenience key, which can be set to launch apps and more. Head to the bottom of the DTEK60 and this is where you'll spot one of the biggest changes for BlackBerry users. A new USB Type-C slot, which for some could either be a great addition or something you'll hate. Don't worry; there's also a USB Type-C cable in the box, but if you want more or need a Quick Charge 3.0 charging block, you'll have to load up on the right ones. I fully suggest checking out Android Central's 'What to look for when buying USB-C cables and adapters' article to learn more.. Additionally, on the bottom is also where you'll find one of the dual-speakers. The speaker grills are on the front and back of the DTEK60 to allow sound to pass through even when face down, and match the ones on the top of the device. Although not a deal breaker, they do capture some dust and lint. The dual-speaker array is quite loud and clear. This makes listening to music, watching movies or even having calls over speakerphone a pretty great experience. Everyone has their own rankings of sound on BlackBerry devices, though most would say Z30 and Passport are among the best, and in my personal testing I would place the DTEK60 in that crowd. A bit of a toss-up for me between all three.. Just as with previous devices in their Android lineup, the left side of the DTEK60 is kept pretty bare. All you have over there is the chrome accented power/reboot button, though this time around it's also where you will find the nanoSIM and microSD card slot capable of handing up to 2TB. Move to the top and to the left, and that is where you will find your 3.5mm headphone jack. Nope, BlackBerry didn't pull an Apple. You can still use all the same headphones and won't have to live that #donglelife like a savage.. You can still use all the same headphones and won't have to live that #donglelife like a savage.. Head to the back of the device and this is where you'll find the only clear sign this is a BlackBerry. Just as on the DTEK50, the back side is the only spot where you see the BlackBerry logo, and stands out on the 'Earth Silver' colored backing. For those concerned about whether or not the DTEK60 is slippery to hold, it is. Unlike Priv and DTEK50, the DTEK60 backing is made of glass, and it's really smooth. Unless you have sticky hands all the time, you're going to want to grab some sort of case for the DTEK60, even if it's just a cheapie. Despite my gripes about it being slippery, the DTEK60 glass back does look nice and again, adds to that elegant, classy feel.. Also on the back is the 21MP camera that boasts features like Phase Detect Auto Focus, Dual Tone LED Flash and more. You can't miss it because there is a significant camera hump that, while fine in the hands, can be bothersome if you're tapping on your device while it's sitting on a table or counter top as the DTEK60 tends to wobble a bit. Of course, the back is also where you'll find a first for BlackBerry users. BlackBerry has taken some shots for not having added one sooner to their hardware but it's here on the DTEK60.. As expected, the fingerprint sensor brings added security for unlocking your phone, accessing Password Keeper, and even making purchases with Android Pay. As expected, the fingerprint sensor brings added security for unlocking your phone, accessing Password Keeper, and even making purchases with Android Pay, if that's your thing. You can add up to five fingerprints which are stored and encrypted through the software and in my testing, the fingerprint sensor here once set up is pretty quick, and doesn't flake out. If I had one complaint about the fingerprint sensor, it would be that it tries to read a fingerprint before I'm even ready to submit one.. For example, if you pick your DTEK60 up off the table and simply just rub a portion of your hands across the sensor, say your palm, it'll try to read it and cause your device to vibrate with an error telling you to try again. I get why it does it, but having your device vibrate in your hands three or four times before you even get it into position to submit your fingerprint gets a little frustrating. I suppose it being too sensitive is better than it not being sensitive enough, though.. Mostly stock Android with some BlackBerry touches. With the DTEK50 BlackBerry sought out a balance between hardware and pricing and because of that, we got a device that is considered to be 'mid-range' when it comes to the specs. For the DTEK60, though, BlackBerry ramped up the pricing a little, bit, and because of that, we got a device that is considered to be 'high-end' when it comes to specs.. ƒ/2.0, Phase Detect Auto Focus, Dual-LED flash. Contextual auto-correct, word prediction, and learning engine. To put this plainly, the DTEK60 is BlackBerry's most powerful Android phone yet. But better than that is the fact that it performs that way as well. Specs don't mean much of anything if the software on the device is not optimized for the hardware. Fortunately, that's not a problem on the DTEK60.. With this being their third Android phone now, BlackBerry has continued their tradition of not messing around with the software too much. As with the Priv and DTEK50, on the DTEK60 you're looking at what is mostly a stock Android experience with just a few touches from BlackBerry.. The items BlackBerry did change, as I noted even in my DTEK50 review, have continued to improve. As this is a review for everyone interested in the DTEK60, I'll run through some of the software components BlackBerry has added, but truth be told, for any Priv or DTEK50 owners reading this, it's a lot of the same, but perhaps, because of the hardware on the DTEK60, everything software-wise tends to run markedly better.. Built directly into the BlackBerry Launcher on the DTEK60, you have the option of enabling BlackBerry pop-up widgets, which allow you to view any app widget by simply swiping up or down across the icon on your home screen, giving you fast and private access to the information you need, when you need it. Not all apps support widgets, unfortunately, but those that do will have a thee-dot indicator beneath the app icon.. Move a supported app to your home screen and from there swipe up, and you'll see the available widget options. In some cases, there will only be one option, but others will have several options or sizes if more than one is available. Choose the one you want, and next time you swipe over that app, you'll see whatever content the widget should show.. Of course, like much of the software BlackBerry has included, it's optional. If you don't want to use pop-up widgets for any of your apps, there is no requirement to do so. For that matter, you don't even have to use the BlackBerry Launcher if you don't want to but it's there and is set as the default out of the box.. Serving as one of the standout features of BlackBerry's Android software is the BlackBerry Hub. As BlackBerry calls it (and I don't disagree with) this 'irreplaceable tool' for consolidating all of your messages in one place, whether it's email, calendar, social, or phone calls, is awesome. Support for the Hub has broadened since its initial release and now it includes Email, Twitter, Facebook, Text Messages, Call Logs, LinkedIn, and of course BBM. On top of that, WhatsApp, Slack, Instagram, Viber, and Pinterest are also included.. Serving as one of the standout features of BlackBerry's Android software is the BlackBerry Hub.. Customizable left and right swipe gestures allow you to delete, snooze, flag, file, mute, and mark read or unread messages while custom views allow you to personalize what you see in the Hub based on specific criteria, whether it be unread messages, flagged messages, important messages or only those with attachments. If that's not enough, there's also the 'pinch to filter ' options, which will filter the Hub to your choice of snoozed items, unread items, emails marked as high importance, flagged emails, or muted conversations. By default, the pinch gesture filters to unread messages, including both email and integrated social / instant messaging content. These are all options you can change, so how you set it up is entirely up to you.. Hub also includes the ability to define account colors, customize quick responses, conversation view, the option to show sent and filed emails, and of course, the option to delete on Hub only or Hub and server plus the option to have it prompt you each time for a choice. Additionally, you can still download images automatically and set up custom alerts for different contacts and messages based on user-defined rules and even add HTML signatures now. Another nice touch is the calendar peek option which, allows you to drag down all your calendar appointments from the top of the Hub for quick viewing or even for adding to your calendar.. Needless to say, if a unified inbox is something you are looking for, then the BlackBerry Hub is something you must give a try. I realize this is a DTEK60 review, but I would be remiss in not mentioning that it's also available on other Android phones as well through BlackBerry's paid Hub+ Services offering available in the Google Play Store .. Another feature added by BlackBerry to their Android software is BlackBerry Device Search. With it you can you can find what you need by searching your Contacts, Calendar, BlackBerry Hub email, documents, media files, and more. The BlackBerry Device Search app also offers a remote search option if the info you are looking for is not found on your device.. You can also type what BlackBerry calls Instant Actions into Device Search. Instant Actions are shortcuts that allow you to perform tasks quickly. In the search field, type a command such as phone, dial or call to place a call or email, mail to send an email. Other options include sending text messages, playing music or even getting directions.. This all sounds great, but throughout my use of the Priv and DTEK50, I have never used Device Search much, and that hasn't changed on the DTEK60. I'm not sure how many others use it, but I never actually hear many folks talking about it so either they also don't use it much, or it works well enough that there's no reason to discuss it.. For what it's worth when I have used it, it always found what I was looking for, but to me, it's not a 'must have' addition. I think most folks who already own an Android-powered BlackBerry would prefer a user-facing pre-loaded file manager over Device Search.. Maintaining an address book or contact list has always been a chore for me but after having used the Priv, DTEK50 and now DTEK60, I have to praise the BlackBerry Contacts app. Aside from offering the basics to advanced features such as remote search, recent contacts management that allows for blocking recent contacts, smart filters and contact groups and more, the BlackBerry Contacts app has helped me maintain a nice and clean contact list. The app does come pre-loaded on all BlackBerry Android devices but there's no real requirement to use it, though it's certainly worth a look. If you don't dig it or are looking for something else, then you can get into a third-party app and just use that instead.. With the BlackBerry Calendar, you can view and respond to your meeting invitations directly from the BlackBerry Hub and by using the Join Now feature you can instantly dial into your meetings directly from your event reminder. Additionally, you can use Google Now voice commands to book meetings and schedule appointments plus there is also the option to enable the fantastic Meeting Mode.. With Meeting Mode, you can automatically silence your audible notifications. It's really a stand-out feature for the BlackBerry Calendar. If you're not feeling the BlackBerry Calendar, no worries. There's no real requirement to use it on your DTEK60, you can disable it and use whatever you wish but seriously, give it a go and I'm sure you will find it to be one of the best calendar options available for Android.. Just as with the Priv and DTEK50, the DTEK60 comes pre-loaded with the Productivity Tab, which provides glanceable views of the most pertinent info from Hub, Calendar, Tasks, and Contacts. For some, this could be a key app offered by the BlackBerry software, but personally, I have found I don't use it all that much.. Granted, for what it is it works, but I simply had higher hopes for the app, like that BlackBerry would add more customization options to it. I know there are a lot of folks out there who are using the Productivity Tab on their Priv and DTEK50, so it's certainly an added feature. It just so happens that I'm not one of them and as such I just disable it because BlackBerry allows for, which is nice.. Every day we hear news about services being hacked and passwords being sent across the internet and to help encourage stronger password security, BlackBerry loads all of their secure Android phones with BlackBerry Password Keeper. Additionally, you can use the Password Keeper app to create secure passwords. If you're using the BlackBerry Keyboard, you can easily insert your saved login info into apps and web pages, and save your login info straight to BlackBerry Password Keeper with auto-fill.. The BlackBerry Password Keeper application allows you to keep all of your passwords, login information, and important records safe and secure. Your information is encrypted using AES-256 and protected by a single password of your choice. Recent updates to the app include the ability to create checklists inside Password Keeper. What a great way to keep holiday gift lists a secret!. While the BlackBerry Keyboard has always been great on Android, BlackBerry has continued to improve their offerings here as well. Key features such as the keyboard learning and providing suggestions as you type and letting you 'flick' them into place are just the start. Swiping horizontally from right to left anywhere on the keyboard will delete previously typed words one-by-one. Swipe vertically from top to bottom, and you can toggle between letters, numbers and characters.. If that's not enough, you can also slide your finger from letter to letter to quickly type with one hand without even lifting your finger off the keyboard. Plus, the keyboard can handle up to 3 languages of your choice all at the same time. Recent updates include the ability to track your keyboard stats plus, you can now use gestures like swipe to delete in type by swiping mode..

Dedicated Security Research & Response Teams : We bring our world-renowned security experts and testing to our line of BlackBerry secure smartphones powered by Android. BlackBerry's secure Android messaging has been consistent since the release of the Priv, and with the DTEK60, they're once again making it clear they believe they have the 'most secure Android smartphones' on the market. Still, most Android phones claim to keep your private stuff private, so it's fair for others to be skeptical of just how secure Android can be. The great thing about BlackBerry's messaging though is they lay out the reasons as to why they can claim offering the 'most secure Android smartphones'. So what is it that they do above and beyond others? Here's a list:. Being 'secure' means a lot of things to a lot of different people and while there are certainly arguments to be had about just how secure BlackBerry's Android really is, there are a few situations here that are hard to ignore. Perhaps the biggest, and most visible to end-users, is that none of BlackBerry's Android offerings have been publicly rooted as of yet. Did anyone give it a try? Hard to say, but the result is the same. The most common Android 'hack' is not available for Priv, DTEK50 or DTEK60 as of yet while the Pixel was just recently hacked for a large bounty .. The other fact is that BlackBerry has had a pretty stellar run at pushing out security updates to their Android devices, often in lockstep with Google's releases and if you're a member of the Beta Zone, there's a good chance you'll have the update even before Google acknowledges it exists. Of course, as we saw with Verizon's poor roll out of Android Marshmallow on Priv, things with carriers can get weird, but in the overall security update strategy, that was a small a blip on the radar.. Monitor – Know at a glance the overall security rating for your device, as well as for specific security features. You can identify whether you need to take any action to improve the security of your device. Control – Easily change your security settings to improve the security rating for your device and specific security features. Track – Turn on event logging to track what your apps are doing. Advanced tools help you track what info your apps have accessed, how it's being used, and the duration of use. This includes which apps are accessing your camera, microphone, location, and personal information. Alert – Be notified of specific application activities when you set up notifications. Introduced on the Priv and carried over to the DTEK50 and DTEK60 is DTEK by BlackBerry. If you're not familiar with the DTEK app as of yet, it allows you to view and improve your privacy level and monitor application access to your camera, microphone, location, and personal information and more.. At this point, with all of BlackBerry's secure Android devices on Marshmallow, DTEK is a great app to have loaded on your device if you're really curious as to what some apps are doing behind the scenes. However, I do caution against solely relying on it as the be all end all of security on your device. The app should be used as a guide for how to improve your device security through simple changes while offering you the option to revoke permissions that you may not like apps having, not your sole resource for better security.. While Priv owners felt comfortable in knowing their move from BlackBerry 10 would include Picture Password, those picking up a DTEK50 were left in the dark for whatever reason thus far as the app is not available there. That changes with the DTEK60 though, and Picture Password has once again returned.. Not familiar with Picture Password? Well, Picture Password allows you to unlock your DTEK60 by placing a finger anywhere on the screen and sliding a pre-selected digit in a moveable number grid over top a pre-selected location within a stationary picture. Because the number grid always shows up in a different pattern, your swipe path is always different and can't be deduced from examining smudge patterns or by looking over your shoulder.. Maybe bigger than the inclusion of Picture Password is BlackBerry's adoption of a fingerprint sensor on the DTEK60. As I noted earlier, the fingerprint sensor brings added security for unlocking your phone, accessing Password Keeper, and even making purchases with Android Pay where available. You can add up to five fingerprints which are stored and encrypted through the software and in my testing, the fingerprint sensor here once set up is pretty quick.. Overall, I'm pleased with the fingerprint senor here and its placement on the back of the device. If rumors are correct, this won't be the only time we see a fingerprint sensor on a BlackBerry smartphone either.. The days of a removable battery in a BlackBerry smartphone seem long over and that always draws concern. The DTEK60 comes packing a 3000mAh battery that BlackBerry notes is enough power to withstand up to 24 hours of mixed use. That's in a perfect real world and well, we don't live in a perfect world. There are always different scenarios and use cases that can affect battery life and what's on paper doesn't always match up.. These days, I've pretty much reduced my first stage of battery testing to 'can it get me through a day?' and in the case of the DTEK60, it has thus far achieved that, with the worst case being that I might have to top up late in the evening to make it through my night owl schedule, but that's where having Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 comes in handy. Just 10 minutes on the charger and you're good to go for at least another 10 percent charge if not more. My second stage comes down to if I can forget to charge my device overnight and whether or not there's enough left in the tank to get me going in the morning. With the DTEK60, that wasn't really a concern provided I wasn't below 15 percent before crashing for the evening. I know some people go hard with their battery testing and try to figure out their screen on time and every single other stat but here's a secret. None of it matters in the long run.. All that matters really is if the device gets you through the day or will leave you stranded when you need it most. In my testing, as long as you don't have your display jacked up to the maximum brightness all day long and keep it at a very reasonable 50 percent or lower, you shouldn't really have any problems with the battery on the DTEK60. Given many folks already have a DTEK60 in their hands, feel free to add your comments on the battery life below or in the CrackBerry Forums .. BlackBerry's hardware choices when it comes to the camera have always been the subject of debate, and that certainly has not changed with the DTEK60. Already in the DTEK60 forums there is plenty of discussion surrounding the picture quality of the DTEK60 compared to pretty much every other device on the market, but before we even get into that realm, let's discuss what BlackBerry's camera app and software even offer here on the DTEK60.. The BlackBerry built camera app offers a wide array of built-in features such as filters, quick access to advanced settings like the flash, aspect ratio, and HDR, and more. Plus, there are plenty of manual options with the BlackBerry Camera app to take advantage of.. For photos, the DTEK60 makes use of a 21MP shooter with Auto-Focus, Dual-Tone Flash, HDR and more. Plus, on the front is a very capable 8MP front-facing camera with a selfie flash. In the video department, DTEK60 can record up to 4K video at various frame rates but keep in mind, to fully achieve that you will need a Class 10 or better SD card. Otherwise, you'll have to use your device storage.. Other goodies in the camera app include 'focus before capture', which allows for taking the picture after the shot is in focus. BlackBerry does note it can slow down the capture time and that's correct but it's faster here than on any previous BlackBerry Android device that supported the feature. There's also face detection, which does exactly as it sounds and seems to work reasonably well, though you can disable it if you wish. For videos, there's enhanced video stabilization to help smooth out some bumps in your video but I didn't find a HUGE change with it off or on.. In the end, camera capabilities are all pretty subjective unless the results are so blatantly bad that they simply stand out in comparison. In my testing of the DTEK60, I have come to the conclusion that it fits my needs rather well and exceeded my expectations. From BlackBerry 10 devices to Priv to DTEK50 to finally the DTEK60, I would say for most folks the DTEK60 is ahead mostly everything else offered by BlackBerry but within the same realm as the Priv, so if you're a Priv owner considering the DTEK60 the camera shouldn't be a concern. If you're on any other BlackBerry smartphone and considering a move to DTEK60, well, you'll likely end up with the best camera you've ever used on a BlackBerry.. So that is just about everything that makes up the DTEK60. The real question though, is how well does it all play out in the real world as that's where it really counts. As it turns out, pretty damn well really. The Snapdragon 820 and 4GB of RAM really shines here and there's no obvious lag or stutter when opening apps and everything just feels as though it has been tuned properly for the DTEK60. If you're running a super graphics intense game, you can expect the DTEK60 to warm up a bit but it has never really hit the previously seen Priv levels of heat where the device will shut down. Same goes for charging; expect the DTEK60 to warm up a bit there.. As a phone, the DTEK60 is up to the task. I tested the device on the Rogers network the whole time and calls always came through nice and clear and no one complained about not being able to hear me, with no garble or anything along those lines. If you spend your time on speakerphone, there shouldn't really be an issue either as the speakers work great for that. Honestly, if there was one complaint there it might be that the speakers are too loud in some cases, especially if someone is yelling at you. Other areas of connectivity have been solid for me as well, such as WiFi, GPS, and the rarely used but still tested NFC.. As on the DTEK50, the MaxxAudio app comes preloaded on the DTEK60 as well offering you better control over your audio experience. Sadly, for whatever reason, there's no FM radio found on the DTEK60 as with BlackBerry's other secure Android offerings. That's going to be a bit of bummer for some who enjoyed that feature, but it is what it is at this point.. If you are a BlackBerry 10 user and don't need the BlackBerry physical keyboard in your life and are looking to upgrade, the DTEK60 is worth a look. If you are a BlackBerry Priv user and don't need the BlackBerry physical keyboard in your life and are looking to upgrade, the DTEK60 is worth a look. If you are a DTEK50 user and love everything it offers but wish it all came in a bigger, faster, and all around better package, the DTEK60 is worth a look.. Over the course of the past few weeks, there has never been a doubt in mind that the DTEK60 is an easy recommendation. The problem I have is nailing down just who the device is for really. If I were to go to by BlackBerry's own material, then this is a perfect device for organizations and fleets looking to roll out a secure Android device with some higher-end specs, but there's honestly more here than that.. This is honestly one of BlackBerry's best consumer-friendly devices that hits a very nice spec-to-pricepoint ratio but that's not really the story BlackBerry is looking to tell here. In the end, I've broken it down to some certain scenarios based on the readership here at CrackBerry to help decide if the DTEK60 is for you.. For everyone else not considered in those scenarios, things get a little bit tougher as the Android world is a big space, but that doesn't mean the DTEK60 isn't still an easy recommendation. If you're looking for some great hardware, along with access to fast security updates, a nearly stock Android experience with some carefully added security features and no bloat, all while not breaking the bank, then the DTEK60 should be at the top of your considerations.. If you're interested in the DTEK60, the device is available to purchase from ShopBlackBerry.com in the US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands for $499 USD ($650 CDN, €579 and £475).

The BlackBerry DTEK50, which launched in July. A screenshot of the now-deleted DTEK60 specs document on BlackBerry’s website, as spotted by GSMArena. A recent listing on BlackBerry’s website appears to have leaked the company’s latest Android handset.. As spotted by CrackBerry , a since-removed page – with the extension “ donotpublish.html ,” no less – temporarily detailed a new “DTEK60” smartphone.. Given that BlackBerry launched an Android phone called the DTEK50 earlier this year, this would seem to be a natural follow-up.. Unlike that decidedly so-so device , though, the DTEK60 appears to be a much higher-end machine. BlackBerry’s page tipped the phone to feature a big and sharp 5.5-inch, 2560×1440 display, a generous Snapdragon 820 chip with 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 3,000mAh battery.. Beyond that, we’re looking at a 21-megapixel main camera, a fingerprint sensor (something the DTEK50 lacked), a programmable side key (something the DTEK50 included), and a USB Type-C port.. Though no pictures of the phone were leaked, one thing that wasn’t mentioned was a QWERTY keyboard, as we’ve seen on past BlackBerry phones like the Priv. It’s also not clear if the device will simply rebadge another company’s reference design, as the DTEK50 did to Alcatel’s Idol 4 phone.. Regardless, all of this lines up with previous rumors. Noted phone leaker Evan Blass reported in June that BlackBerry had three phones on the way, codenamed Neon, Argon, and Mercury. Neon turned out to be the DTEK50, while Mercury is said to bring back the physical keyboard early next year. So, this would be Argon.. In any case, a new BlackBerry phone would have to face the same hurdles the company has struggled to overcome for the past several years. Though the company has embraced Android, it’s still mostly reliant on the name recognition generated by its former mobile dominance. It’s unlikely that a high-end, probably expensive phone like this would do much to turn that around, but it looks like it could be enticing for those still on the BlackBerry train (looking at you, Kim Kardashian West)..

BlackBerry DTEK60 review: A great Android phone and the best BlackBerry. The BlackBerry DTEK60 isn't getting much attention outside of the hardcore BB audience. That's a shame because it's one of the best phones of 2016.. No, I haven't lost my marbles. The BlackBerry DTEK60 really is that good.. Like a lot of Android fans and people who write words about phones for a living, I chuckled and instantly dismissed the DTEK60 before it even arrived. BlackBerry having Alcatel make a phone for them and deigning to charge a premium price for it sounded like a recipe for disaster much like the Priv. Good phone, great phone — none of that matters when you're competing against the Samsung juggernaut, especially when you have BlackBerry's reputation (mostly unfair, in my opinion). Is BlackBerry even still in business? They lost about 99% of their market in the past five years and everyone outside a small group of the BlackBerry faithful has written the company off. What could they possibly do to turn things around?. You start by making a phone like the DTEK60, that's what.. Before we go too deep here, you need to take a few minutes and read through one of the most comprehensive phone reviews ever written. Bla1ze has detailed every single feature that BlackBerry's Android has and you'll have a great understanding of how the company stands out in an ocean of companies building Android phones.. We start there because the software is what makes the DTEK60 worth looking at. The hardware isn't bad — Snapdragon 820, 4GB of RAM, QHD display, and even an SD card slot. It's the same configuration as every other "flagship" Android phone sold since last March. Drop all that into a fairly nondescript package from Alcatel parent, TCL, and you have nothing that's going to catch anyone's eye. The $499 price tag also isn't going to grab your attention and suck you in because there are other phones using equal or better hardware that hit that price or are cheaper. This is a problem almost every company that makes Android phones is up against — a good phone at a reasonable price just isn't enough in a world where Samsung and Apple exist.. A good phone at a reasonable price just isn't enough in a world where Samsung and Apple exist.. You can ask any of the people using one every day and they will tell you the same thing, From a performance standpoint, the DTEK60 will do everything you want it to do with nary a whine or whimper. The usability — good hardware combined with good software — of the DTEK60 does a commendable job making up for the one glaring hardware blunder: not including image stabilization in the camera. Honestly, that's the only real fault I can find with the phone hardware that's not a matter of opinion or preference. In late 2016, if you make a smartphone you need to have a kick-ass camera on it.. ƒ/2.0, Phase Detect Auto Focus, Dual-LED flash. Using the DTEK60 for a busy week filled with too much running around on the T-Mobile network left me with no complaints. Battery life was between acceptable and good while syncing all my stuff and all of Android Central's stuff. Call quality was exceptional (the DTEK60 has the best speakerphone I've ever used). The data connection was great around my home where T-Mobile offers good service and as good as any other phone in the places where T-Mo can be spotty and plain bad. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate.. The DTEK60 has the best speakerphone I've ever used.. Bluetooth worked with my MotoROKR headphones and a handful of standalone car speakerphone setups. The screen could be better in the sun, but it's as good as the Nexus 6P which always worked well enough for me. Since I don't take a lot of pictures with my phone, I had no complaints. Everything was good, but plenty of other phones are all good when it comes to things like battery life or call quality.. The glass back is expected on most any phone built nowadays, but the addition of a programmable convenience button wasn't. It works well after you set it up to open one of the things that you often need to use. The DTEK60 is a completely unassuming package that more or less matches everything else worth buying in its price range on the outside.. So what makes the DTEK60 one of the phones I would suggest a person spend the money they worked hard to earn and buy? The software and the "total package" it brings to the table.. When you turn on the DTEK60 you know it's running Android. You also know it's a BlackBerry. The company has mixed the two to create the best BlackBerry consumer phone ever offered in a way that will appeal to people who like using Android.. Every now and then a company like Alcatel will do it. But most of the time, it's not very successful and it takes some user dedication to getting rid of the things that need to go and adding the things that are missing — the ASUS ZenFone 2 was a great example of this. It was a great phone after you made it a great phone.. The alternative is to follow what companies like Samsung and LG are doing and replace everything you can replace. That's great for the Samsungs and Hauweis of the world who can afford it (software developers don't come cheaply) and whether you like the style of their products or not, you can't deny that these companies deliver a complete product filled with things that just work once you log into them. And companies have to be successful with how they change the operating system, because if every phone ran plain vanilla Android, everyone would buy either a $100 Moto E or a Pixel and we would be out of a job.. BlackBerry's take on Android is what makes the DTEK60 stand out.. Things haven't really changed since the Priv introduced Android on a BlackBerry. The software looks and feels like vanilla Android with BlackBerry's complete suite of services and software installed. But BlackBerry has improved at writing Android code, and the DTEK60 has hardware that's a good bit more powerful. BlackBerry's application suite includes the launcher (complete with swipe gestures and shortcuts), the excellent software keyboard, an OS-integrated password manager and BlackBerry Hub and Productivity tabs. To offer the Hub integration BlackBerry users expect the contacts, calendar, and dialer apps have been customized. These apps, as well as BlackBerry Tasks, work with the productivity tab so everything is where you would expect it to be if you're interested in using it.. It just so happens that I'm not a fan of either the Hub or the Productivity tab. After seeing if there were any differences specific to the DTEK60 (there are none) I turned off and disabled both. There's nothing wrong with either, but they just don't fit into the way I do things and I'm too old to adapt and try new things.. It just so happens that I'm not a fan of either the Hub or the Productivity tab.. Even without these services in use, I find my core set of communication apps, namely contacts, calendar, and dialer, are easy to use and do the things they're supposed to do in a logical and easy way. No, it's not exactly the same as the way Google does it. But it's all done well and doesn't force me to change from how the Google way does those same things. Of course, BBM is included because you can't make a BlackBerry without adding BBM to the pot. I just wish more people used BBM because the service is feature-rich and secure (unless you live in a few countries in Asia where "the man" has access). But talking to yourself gets old, and Phil is never online (read my message with the teddy bear stickers, Phil).. Oh, and a note about Nougat. But this runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, which is fine, because it's fast as hell, but it still would have been nice to see this running 7.0.. Building software that offers expanded functionality yet is still great when you don't use any of it isn't easy, but BlackBerry nails it. What started on the Priv is now finished on the DTEK60, and I can say I like BlackBerry's take on the core Android experience. Other changes are cosmetic and the rest of the vendor software — things like the clock or the settings work just like they work on a Nexus or Pixel phone even if the colors and graphics have changed. We were impressed with how Motorola managed to do this a few years back, and we're just as impressed with the way BlackBerry has done it.. Android's security features are there, too.. The DTEK60 has proven to be as secure as promised. We aren't sure of the exact details on some of the things BlackBerry does to make it so, but they take everything Android from Google offers on the security front and add to it.. BlackBerry doesn't take away any of the security features Google has implemented when they add their own.. The kernel is further hardened, the base system ha protections to keep from being modified and to stop everything to wait for the user to decide what to do if it were to happen. The boot services are secured in a similar way on top of the standard encrypted lock. Add in the fact that BlackBerry has never been even an hour late on any Android security bulletin updates (they're usually early and the first to receive them) until you add a carrier who doesn't care that you receive them on time (that means AT&T — they don't care about your online security as much as Google or BlackBerry) and you can't argue with BlackBerry's claim that the DTEK60 is the most secure Android phone available.. There's also a DTEK app (which stands for Detection ) that doesn't really contribute to any of this that the company insists on keeping around and talking about. It alerts you that you may not be as secured as you could be without any advice what to do about it or any helpful information with a meter and a scary red section. It's not hurting anything, it's just not very useful the way it is. I hope BlackBerry improves it or drops it rather than spend any resources maintaining it the way it stands.. The most important thing about this security feature stuff from a user standpoint — their full disk encryption methods (FIPS 140-2 compliant if you work somewhere that makes that mean something) — doesn't bog everything down. A big part of the random 10FPS lag-glitch we see on the Priv can be attributed to file system performance. BlackBerry has taken Android and made it their own. The Priv showed promise but performance issues put a damper on any excitement most people would have for it; the DTEK60 is what it looks like when it all works as intended and runs well. The DTEK60 is more than just a phone for ex-BB users.. The price is in that tough spot where you can find some great stuff. Phones between $300 and $500 are now considered cheap when they offer top of the line hardware and a great interface to do things with it. I think BlackBerry's attention to user security and privacy is something that adds plenty of value and makes the DTEK60 stand out from other good phones at the price point. Especially when it comes without any drawbacks to using it.. If the Pixel was never built, I'd probably use the DTEK60 as my phone — the one with my own SIM card that I won't be resetting or changing until something replaces it next year. The core software experience is great right out of the box and even things you've not used before work the way you would expect them to work. If a friend or family member said they were buying a DTEK60, I'd say it's a great choice, and if they were looking to buy a new phone I'd point them at it. I liked (and used) the Priv right up until I got the DTEK60 and expected it to be usable. I didn't expect it to be this good.. BlackBerry did a great job on the DTEK60, and it's more than just a phone people coming from "old" BlackBerry should look at. Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL. Careers: Writer | Dev.

BlackBerry DTEK60: Is It Good for Business?. Product and service reviews are conducted independently by our editorial team, but we sometimes make money when you click on links. By Brett Nuckles, Business News Daily Contributor. October 26, 2016 01:02 pm EST. BlackBerry's new DTEK60 firmly targets business users with features designed to make it more secure than the average Android smartphone. Those extra security options include automatic encryption and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, among others. Plus, it promises fast performance, a sharp and roomy 5.5-inch display, and a slim, durable design. It's available today on BlackBerry's website for $499.. If you haven't used a BlackBerry phone in a while, you might be surprised by the DTEK60. Whereas older BlackBerry phones ran on the company's own operating system, which was noteworthy for its relative lack of apps, newer BlackBerry devices run on the Android operating system. That means you get a great selection of apps, in addition to a more modern and user-friendly interface.. BlackBerry says the DTEK60's security options set it apart from rival Android smartphones. The device offers secure boot functionality , and full disk encryption is enabled by default. Additionally, a fingerprint reader lets you unlock the phone with one touch, and its rear-mounted placement makes it convenient to reach.. Some nice security software also comes preloaded on the DTEK60. That includes a built-in password manager, which can generate and store secure passwords and then retrieve them automatically whenever they're needed. There's also the DTEK app, which monitors your phone's security status and lets you resolve any issues with a few taps.. Hardware highlights include a 5.5-inch, quad-HD display that should feel noticeably roomier than the 5.2-inch screen on the DTEK50 , BlackBerry's previous release. The DTEK60 offers 32GB of onboard storage and runs on a speedy Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, which should provide zippy performance. In addition, its beefy 3,000-mAh battery comes with quick charging capabilities to help you juice up your device just before you leave the office.. All of those internals and features add up to a device that could entice some workers back to the BlackBerry brand — but the DTEK60 will face some stiff competition. If you order from BlackBerry and pay before Nov. 8, the phone will come with its own case and a rapid charger for free.

It's a BlackBerry Jim, but not as we know it. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.. WE LOVED the BlackBerry DTEK50 , and the newly self-styled software-first firm has just announced a follow-up to the popular device, the aptly-named BlackBerry DTEK60.. If we're to believe anything BlackBerry tell us these days the DTEK60 is the "world's most secure" Android smartphone - we wonder how the DTEK50 feels about that.. While the previous model suffered thanks to the double whammy of cheap pricing and low specs, the BlackBerry DTEK60 at least looks to right those ills.. Ahead of our review proper, here's our first impressions of BlackBerry's latest Android-shaped assault.. Design It's a badly-kept secret that the BlackBerry DTEK60 is based on the Alcatel-built TCL 950, with BlackBerry announcing earlier last month that it's no longer building its own hardware and instead letting someone else do the heavy lifting. Both of the DTEK models released this year at least maintain some form of uniformity, and it's certainly not a bad design either.. The BlackBerry DTEK60 sports a premium glass and aluminium frame (where the previous model perhaps relied on plastic just a little too much), in a mash of black, silver and grey. The darker aluminium bezels contrast nicely with the glass rear where a single, lone reminder of the BlackBerry brand lives.. After carting around Google's supersized Pixel XL for the past few weeks, the mere 3g weight difference isn't at all noticeable. The BlackBerry DTEK60 rocks a similarly-sized 5.5in display which would cause us to label it as lumbering and imposing if it wasn't for its thinness.. At just 6.9mm thick, it surpasses the DTEK50 as BlackBerry's "thinnest smartphone ever" (why don't you plough another stake through its heart, eh BlackBerry?), yet in hand it feels a little awkward. This is especially true when reaching for the minuscule fingerprint reader found on the rear. It really is the dinkiest, and looks all the more silly when there's a honking great camera protrusion above. That thing sticks out a ton, but that's the price we're paying for this new 21MP sensor.. The power button has been relegated to the left of the device, while the programmable 'Convenience Button' is still a thing, and lives below the volume controls on the right.. Thankfully, the dual front and rear speakers make a welcome return, and we're pleased that BlackBerry is obviously paying attention to this often overlooked aspect. Audio output is again controlled by JBL's Waves MaxxAudio - we'd recommend turning off the 'Auto select' mode, and tweaking the settings in order to get the best results.. Hardware Gone is the under-powered engine-room of the DTEK50, and in comes the darling of 2016 - Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820. This is a quad-core model with cores running at 2.15GHz and 1.6GHz. It's backed with 4GB of RAM.. Display The reference TCL model that the DTEK60 was built on scrimped on the display front with an unspectacular FHD resolution, but fortunately the BlackBerry uses an upgraded 2560x1440 QHD panel.. The 5.5in AMOLED display is pleasantly bright, and plenty sharp at 534ppi, which BlackBerry felt compelled to boast is 4x the number of pixels seen on a standard HDTV. We must also heap praise on the curved glass layer that covers the display, with this slight tapering helping to set it apart from the hordes of plain Androids otherwise clamouring for our custom.. It's supposed to be "scratch and smudge resistant" too, but even with limited use our fingerprints were beginning to leave their mark. To us, that makes it no better than the competition it hopes to beat.. Cameras The rear-mounted 21MP camera is built around a Sony IMX230 sensor, the f/2.0 aperture is perfunctory, but Phase Detection Auto Focus (PDAF) and dual-tone LED flash are both nice additions. It impresses in its speed too - the time it took to switch into shooting mode and fire that shutter was almost instantaneous.. There's more than enough features to satisfy the casual photographer, including built-in filters, and a useful HDR mode. In addition, a manual mode offers white balance, shutter speed, ISO sensitivity, and exposure compensation for greater control..

While many Android handset makers are hell-bent on making their own mark on the Android operating system, BlackBerry has shown remarkable restraint with the DTEK60. To the casual observer the user interface looks practically the same as what you'd expect to see on stock Android devices like the Nexus 5X and Google Pixel .. This is most definitely a positive thing; the more modifications a manufacturer makes to the interface, the greater chance there is of bugs and compatibility issues being unwittingly introduced, and the additional time needed to customize the interface means software updates lag behind those seen on Google-branded devices.. Such is BlackBerry's willingness to dance to Google's tune that the DTEK60 doesn't come with custom music and media apps.. Instead, the phone ships with Google Photos and Google Play Music as standard. If you're an existing Android user then you'll likely prefer these apps anyway, and use them over the largely pointless variants which ship on phones from the likes of Samsung, LG and Sony.. Like so many of Google's apps, cloud storage makes these almost indispensable, and when you switch to a new phone you don't have to worry about losing your photos, videos, music or files. By sticking with Google's offerings, BlackBerry has skillfully avoided the needless duplication of features that so often plague Android devices.. While BlackBerry is happy to keep the core interface close to Google's own vision, the company has introduced new ideas of its own which really set the DTEK60 apart from its Android rivals – some of which work better than others.. The most notable has to be the BlackBerry Hub, a unified inbox for all your emails, text messages, tweets, calls, calendar appointments and instant messages.. Designed to look like the Gmail app, this all-in-one option does an excellent job of pulling together all your vital messages in one place, but if you're used to Android's already robust notification system then its value might be slightly diminished.. We personally find it a little overwhelming to see all of these notifications in a single app, but your own experience may vary, especially if you dislike having to hop between applications to respond to alerts.. Interestingly, this isn't totally unique to the DTEK60 or even BlackBerry phones, as it can be downloaded to other Android devices via Google Play.. BlackBerry has pre-loaded some of its own security-conscious apps, which are clearly aimed at business and enterprise users. WatchDox is a secure file-sharing tool with in-depth permission management, while underlying functionality is secured by high-level encryption across instant messaging, email and apps.. The DTEK security app is the perhaps the most visible element of BlackBerry's quest to eradicate any vulnerabilities, and runs in the background at all times, monitoring elements such as app permissions, data encryption, operating system integrity and even the suitability of your screen lock.. Should any area not pass muster, DTEK will warn you of this and encourage you to take action.. Finally, there's BlackBerry Password Keeper, which secures all your precious log-in details using AES-256 encryption and a single master password. In a neat touch you can also write secret notes within the Password Keeper to keep them away from prying eyes.. BlackBerry boasts that the DTEK60 is the most secure Android phone ever made, which is kind of like bragging that you've got the world's best chocolate teapot – Google's operating system doesn't have the best reputation when it comes to overall security, largely thanks to the fact that most Android phones can be rooted for customization and thereby exposed to all kinds of attacks.. Even so, BlackBerry is deadly serious about locking down its phones, and at the time of writing none of its Android devices have been rooted. The DTEK60 is designed to only function if the bootloader remains completely secure, and regular security updates are issued each month.. There's also what BlackBerry calls the "Hardware Root of Trust", with security keys being added to the processor which track, verify, and provision each device. All of this might seem like overkill, but it's important to remember that BlackBerry's focus is on business users who share confidential corporate data.. Elsewhere, BlackBerry has added pop-up widgets to the core Android interface. These work like 3D Touch pop-ups on iOS, but instead of a push you swipe up or down on the app icon.. This opens up a window which shows the available widgets for that application; pick one and the next time you swipe, you'll see the information presented by that widget. It's a great middle ground for those who like to see data at a glance but don't want massive widgets taking up their home screen.. There are also gesture controls, which allow you to open a particular app simply by swiping in a certain direction from the home button, and BlackBerry's own "Intelligent Keyboard", which learns how you type and comes with speedy "swipe to type" input.. After using the keyboard for a while we found ourselves reverting to Google's standard keyboard – available from the Google Play Store for free – but BlackBerry's effort is certainly one of the best custom efforts we've seen in a long time, which is unsurprising when you consider that physical keyboards were its key USP not so long ago.. Finally, we have the Productivity Tab, which sits on the side of the screen and can be opened with a swipe from the edge of the display. From here, you get an overview of your upcoming events, text messages, open tasks and your available contacts.. While it initially seems like a useful feature to have, the longer we spent with the DTEK60 the less we actually used it.. Annoyingly, we only remembered its existence on the numerous times that we accidentally opened the tab when performing other actions. Thankfully, like almost all the additional features BlackBerry has added into this handset, the Productivity Tab can be disabled entirely if you wish.. The DTEK60's large and striking AMOLED screen is predictably a great platform for watching movies and playing games.. However, its high resolution does mean that certain intense 3D games run less smoothly than on phones like the Xiaomi Mi5 , which boasts the same Snapdragon 820 chipset but has a more manageable 1080p screen that places less strain on the internal hardware.. It's by no means a deal-breaker though, and gaming on BlackBerry's blower is still an enjoyable experience.. Audio is a much more agreeable affair, thanks to the DTEK60's unique stereo speaker setup. There's a speaker at the top and bottom of the device, but the grilles which allow the audio to pass out are present on both the front and back of the phone, offering 360-degree sound.. The speakers are powerful and clear, making this a great option for listening to tunes sans headphones.. Thanks to the bundled Waves MaxxAudio app, you can fine-tune the sound by tinkering with variables such as bass and treble, and these alterations carry across the entire interface, not just music playback. The results are best appreciated when using a set of headphones.. The DTEK60 is among the first of BlackBerry's Android-based devices to really boast flagship hardware specifications, and its high-end specs show in the overall performance of the phone.. With Qualcomm's excellent Snapdragon 820 chipset doing the heavy lifting and 4GB of DDR4 RAM keeping things running, the user experience is rarely less than buttery-smooth.. Keeping the operating system close to stock Android will have no doubt helped in this regard, and we never encountered any pauses or stuttering, even when the handset was performing several different processor-intensive tasks at once.. For some unknown reason the Geekbench 4 benchmark refused to work on the DTEK60, but we did get AnTuTu running and it returned an excellent score of 147126, which is in line with other Snapdragon 820-powered devices – in other words, the DTEK60 delivers flagship performance..
