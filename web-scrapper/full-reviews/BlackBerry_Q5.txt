The Q5 is targeted largely at emerging markets because of its lower end specifications. It is available in black, white, red, pink and grey. Like the BlackBerry Q10 , it has a QWERTY keyboard. While typing, there is the option to type using the keyboard on the touchscreen. The keyboard has more space between the individual keys allowing for ease of typing. The touchscreen is small in size with a high resolution allowing the user to be able to read and view images with ease. However, the camera on the device is only five megapixels, [2] which is below the norm that is eight-megapixels.. Exclusive features include BlackBerry Hub, which allows users to view email, messages, and social network updates with a swipe to the side while using any application. Time Shift Mode creates perfect photos by taking multiple photos and this allows the user to isolate a single part of the photo and move it. The BlackBerry Q5 was first available in the United Arab Emirates. [4] The phone is also available now in India and Canada. [5] The target regions for this product are Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America. [6] India is the first country in Asia Pacific where this product was launched. [7] In 2014, BlackBerry had a large portion of the smartphone market in India. ^ "Blackberry unveils Q5 handset targeted at emerging markets". ^ BlackBerry: [1] 31. ^ BlackBerry: [2] , 31. ^ CrackBerry: BlackBerry Q5 to go on sale first in the UAE - tomorrow! , 19. ^ BlackBerry 10 Magic. ^ CBC: [3] , 31. ^ BlackBerry Q5 Review , BlackBerry Empire, Retrieved on 2 September 2013. ^ BlackBerry Strikes Back: [4] , 31. ^ "What Developers Need To Know – BlackBerry Q5 Edition". ^ "BlackBerry Q5 - See the New BlackBerry Q5 Smartphone - Global". ^ "Introducing the BlackBerry Q5 smartphone with different regional models".

CNET también está disponible en español.. BlackBerry Q5 smartphone officially unveiled (hands-on). BlackBerry officially pulled the tarp off of its rumored Q5 midrange smartphone at the company's BlackBerry Live conference. We go hands on with the device.. by July 12, 2013 9:07 AM PDT. Check out CNET's sister site, CNET UK's, full BlackBerry Q5 review , published July 3, 2013. -- Here at BlackBerry Live 2013, the long-rumored BlackBerry Q5 handset became legitimate. The midrange device will sport a design reminiscent of the old Curve models but use materials less pricey than what's in the current Q10 flagship.. That means the BlackBerry Q5 boasts a full QWERTY keyboard but won't sport the premium keys you'll find on the Q10. Instead, the Q5's buttons are flatter and more bubbly, not chiseled typing surfaces expertly angled for message-punching perfection.. Indeed, when I was able to spend some time with the Q5 after BlackBerry Live's keynote address, I can confirm that new Q5 feels cheaper than the premium Q10. The Q5's glossy plastic surfaces are slippery and prone to grease and fingerprints. That said, I do like the arresting fiery-red hue of the Q5 model I manhandled.. Still there's much for true BlackBerry fans to love here, including the company's latest BlackBerry 10.1 operating system. Thankfully, the device responded to my finger swipes and commands with the same agility I saw on the Q10 and Z10.. Other key specs include a 3.1-inch touch screen and a digital camera that supports the Time Shift mode, which snaps multiple images at once, then lets you choose the best shot. One bummer is that the camera's sensor is a less-sensitive 5 megapixels as opposed to the 8-megapixel units you'll find on the Q10 and Z10.. The gadget will also come in three colors and will ship in select markets located in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.. Stay tuned as we provide more details as we get them from BlackBerry Live 2013, and hopefully we'll have a review model of the BlackBerry Q5 soon.. CNET earns fees when you click these offers..

The BlackBerry Q5 is only the third BB10 handset to make it to market, and the first to target a more affordable price point. A replacement of sorts to the BlackBerry Curve range, the Q5 is the mid-market sibling to the touchscreen BlackBerry Z10 and the fellow QWERTY BlackBerry Q10 .. The Q5 has the same 3.1-inch HD display as the Q10, but runs a slower 1.2GHz dual-core CPU and has a 5-megapixel rear-mounted camera. It’s available for £320 on a PAYG basis, so it’s priced to go head-to-head with the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini , and is available in black, white and red.. Is the BlackBerry Q5 cheap enough to convert those upgrading from old BlackBerry OS 7 handsets and can BB10 bring the fight to Android? Let’s take a look.. Watch our BlackBerry Q5 video review:. It doesn’t get off to the most auspicious of starts. The BlackBerry Q5’s design is not the most ergonomic, solid or pleasing on the eye. At 10.8mm thick and 120g in weight the Q5 isn’t especially thick or heavy, but it feels heavier at its base than at the top (perhaps because of the QWERTY keyboard), which makes it feel unbalanced.. The BlackBerry Q5’s plastic body doesn’t help, either. It makes the Q5 feel more like an entry-level phone than a £320 mid-range one. It creaks and groans when put under even moderate amounts of pressure, and our sample shows signs of wear after just a few days’ use.. The Q5’s design is a long step away from the premium metal and carbon fibre effect Q10 and struggles to meet the build quality of many of its similarly priced rivals, including the aging but still stunningly timeless iPhone 4 and the world’s thinnest smartphone, the Huawei Ascend P6 .. On more practical points, the backplate isn’t removable. Not only does this lock the battery in, it means the SIM and microSD slots are only accessible via a fiddly plastic flap on the phone’s left edge. It’s far from robust and is yet another point of weakness. Button placement is sensible, however, and the controls are easy to reach when holding the phone in a single hand. It’s just a shame the Q5 doesn’t feel nicer.. As has often been the case with BlackBerry’s handsets, the Q5’s physical QWERTY keyboard is the phone’s saviour. The keys are well-spaced and a comfortable size, which makes tapping out messages fast and effortless. If you can look past the slightly chintzy design, the Q5’s QWERTY keyboard won’t disappoint..

Like the BlackBerry Q10 before it, the Q5 has a 3.1-inch square display with a 720 x 720-pixel resolution. A strong 338 pixels-per-inch image density means text is pin sharp with no faint or smudged edges.. Its sharp, then, but the Q5’s LCD screen could benefit from being a little brighter. Colours are just as rich and vibrant as on many an AMOLED display rival, like the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini, but it’s hard to use in bright, direct sunlight, where glare becomes a problem.. The BlackBerry Q5 screen looks ever so slightly recessed, too, which probably explains its problems in bright light, but that’s not the most serious problem. The Q5 constantly struggles to overcome the limitations of its 3.1-inch square display. Web pages look cramped videos are near unwatchable as they’re so small and crushed by black bars.. It’s a problem for games, too, as many of the BlackBerry 10 apps available don’t adapt to the Q5’s 1:1 aspect ratio.. Trusted Reviews is part of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd Fashion & Beauty Network.

These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.. $150 Buy. $97 Buy.

is the third BlackBerry 10 device to hit the market and the second to feature a physical. keyboard (the first being the Q10). It was originally unveiled during BlackBerry Live 2013 and while it has been released in various markets already, it will ultimately be available in a variety of colors including black, white, red and pink.. The Q5 is a more affordable option to those not opting for the higher priced BlackBerry Z10 or BlackBerry Q10 and arguably could have (or should have) been released along with the others - or even as the first BlackBerry 10 device. so even though it's the least expensive BB10 device currently available, you'll still be shelling out quite a bit to pick one up (though it will most likely be cheaper if/when it hits the US).. At first glance the Q5 could fit well into the Curve line thanks to the classic BlackBerry design and separated Curve-style keys, but once started up it's obvious this is a new device for a new set of BlackBerry users.. The Q5 is running BlackBerry 10.1 and does it well thanks to the 1.2GHz processor and 2GB of RAM. Believe it or not, the Q5 has the same 3.1" 720x720 display of the Q10, the only difference being the Q5 is an LCD compared to the SuperAMOLED screen of the Q10.. It's clear BlackBerry will be providing options for users who still want a physical keyboard, as well as full touchscreen devices - now with the Z10 and down the road with devices like the rumored BlackBerry A10 .. We took a quick look at the BlackBerry Q5 in our first impressions review , but lets dive a bit deeper into the latest device from BlackBerry.. One thing to note is that my Q5. came from the UAE so it's sporting an Arabic keyboard - so if you were wondering about it, now you know.. Of course we had to unbox the Q5 as it's a bit of a tradition at this point. The usual items are in the box with the Q5 - manuals, USB cord, power block and ear-buds. BlackBerry and carriers haven't opted to include any type of case with the BlackBerry 10 devices, but it doesn't seem to be causing too much of an uproar from most users.. The Q5 has some good features overall, but falls short in places as well. What's good is that it has a 1.2GHz processor with 2GB of RAM - more than enough to power the BlackBerry 10 OS and keep it running smoothly. The 3.1" LCD touchscreen is bold and bright and the Q5 is sporting LTE, Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS and NFC. battery is actually one of the biggest to date, but the fact that it's non-removable is a downer.. Where is falls short are in things like the small 8GB. of internal storage, a 5MP camera and lack of a micro HDMI. The Curve-style keyboard feels like a bit of a step backwards as well. It's not a bad typing experience but still feels a bit out of date.. While the BlackBerry Q10 was the first full QWERTY BlackBerry 10 device to market, the BlackBerry Q5 is a more entry-level device for those in emerging markets or users looking for a more inexpensive way to start out with BlackBerry 10. The Q5 keeps the classic BlackBerry design while brining back the Curve-style keyboard we've seen on devices such as the Curve 8300 and Curve 8330. As opposed to the flush keyboard of devices in the Bold and Torch lines (and most recently the BlackBerry Q10) the Q5 takes on the separated keys style instead.. The keyboard sits under the bright 720x720 LCD display (328ppi). Inside is a dual-core 1.2GHz Snapdragon processor with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. The processor is more than enough to handle BlackBerry 10 running on the Q5 and we noticed no lag or slow downs when navigating around the OS.. On the right of the Q5 are the volume and mute buttons. The left has a MicroUSB charging/sync port as well as the covered MicroSD and SIM card slots. Notably absent is the Micro HDMI out port that we've seen on the Q10, Z10 and BlackBerry PlayBook.. The power/standby button is on top of the device while the speaker rests on the bottom. You won't find any charging contacts here either which isn't a huge issue, however the non-removable 2180mAh battery is one of our big gripes on the Q5.. The whole packaged is wrapped from head to toe in gloss plastic. It makes the device feel solid all around and gives a cohesive look, but still leaves you feeling slighted a bit as there is no "flair" to show off the Q5. You won't find any added design features like keyboard frets or stainless steel bezels. What you see is what you get.. The Q5 will be a familiar device for current BlackBerry users. The BlackBerry Q5 is a good looking device. It's the classic BlackBerry design - screen on top, keyboard underneath. You can tell that it's not a "high end" device from looking at it head-on however. There is nothing shiny - no frets between the keys and no stainless feel bezel. It's not flashy at all but that's ok. It still does what it has to without compromising anything at the core.. The Q5 will be a familiar device for current BlackBerry users. Anyone that has used a Curve in the past will automatically know the Q5 keyboard and get a good feel for it right away. While it's not totally the same as what we've had in the past, it's pretty close. The keys are spaced well and just the right size. The Q5 weighs in at around 4.2oz so it's not a heavy device by any means and it definitely feels good in the hand. The flat plastic wraps around the sides and across the back of the device making it feel very solid overall - to the point that I really had no fear of dropping it. It's a very slick device in that at times I did find it hard to grip, but at the same time it fits in the hand very well.. It's worth noting that the casing on the Q5 is plastic all the way around. It's black from head to toe. It does remind me a bit of older devices like the Curve 8500 as there is no design separation from the front to back of the phone. It feels very solid overall but still leaves me wanting a bit more. Understandably it's a lower-tier BlackBerry 10 device, but it isn't necessarily "cheap" it still feels a bit plain in my opinion.. The 3.1" 720x720 LCD touchscreen on the Q5 fits the device very well. It's not too big and not too small. As opposed to the SuperAMOLED screen of the Q10, the Q5 has an LCD screen which is what we've been accustomed to in the past. The screen is bold and bright and shows colors very well. The LCD screen goes back to what we have on older devices and the Z10. As the Q10 has a SuperAMOLED display we get the cool black theme designed to save battery. On the Q5 the theme is the same as the Z10 so the calendar and other blacked-out apps from the Q10 will be white here. I still wish the option was available to choose a white or black thee however.. What I do like is that there is a good amount of space between the bottom of the screen and the top of the keyboard, leaving room for gestures. On the Q10 there is very little space between the bottom of the screen and the top row of keys making some bottom gestures hard at times. On the Q5 however I found that I rarely had issues trying to perform any gestures from the bottom of the screen. There is a good amount of space left over the top row of keys but you still don't really loose too much of the design thanks to the BlackBerry logo being pushed down. Rather than it being on top of the screen, it helps to fill the space underneath so it's not just an awkward gap.. The Q5 keyboard is both a hit and a miss. The Q5 keyboard is both a hit and a miss. While I've been able to type on it without a hitch, I have to say that in my opinion it is also a fairly loud keyboard and very plastic. It's safe to say that I was spoiled by the keyboard on the Bold 9900 as well as the Q10 so I'm used to a "softer" keyboard at this point. The keys on the Q5 are the tic-tac buttons we've seen on the Curve models for years and are a bit more "clicky" (yes, clicky) than most recent devices, making for a much louder hit when typing.. That being said, it's not a bad keyboard. The keys are nice and big and well spaced making for a good typing experience overall. I do like having the spaced out keys in that I find I make less errors when typing as my fingers don't wander to keys I'm not trying to hit. I'll admit that on my Q10 when I'm pounding out a message I sometimes hit the wrong keys with my thumbs, but on the Q5 it seemed to be much less of an issues for me.. The top three rows of keys on the Q5 are all the same size (letters, ALT, delete and enter) so there is nothing abnormal about typing. The size of the bottom rows keys is nice as well though I do wish the space key was just a touch longer.. Just as with the Q10, the Q5 brings in plenty of keyboard shortcuts as well which helps get things done faster. Instant Action remains one of my favorite features and really makes me appreciate having a physical keyboard.. The camera on the BlackBerry Q5 is sadly only 5MP. While it's not the worst camera on a mobile device (we're looking at you Bold 9900!) it's certainly not the greatest. The good news is that I've was able to get some surprisingly. good photos despite the low specs. I don't really use my BlackBerry camera for any crazy photo shoots and I'd expect that most Q5 users won't be looking to achieve greatness with the camera. For quick, on the spot photos or the occasional landscape or food shot (shame on you!) the Q5 will hold up just fine however. The front-facing camera rings in at just 2MP - just barely enough for decent Skype or BBM Video and maybe a selfie or two. The short of it - don't expect too much from the camera on the Q5.. Here's a few shots to compare with the Q10. For the outdoor shot the Q10 did a much better job, but inside the Q5. did better and showed off much more color.. The battery is a mixed bag for me with the Q5. I suppose I'm spoiled by having so many devices with removable batteries over the years, so not being able to remove the battery in the Q5 is a downer for me. With my Q10 and Z10 I love that I can bring along my BlackBerry Battery Charger Bundle when I go out and never have to worry about not having power. While I can obviously charge the Q5 if I need to (even with said battery bundle) I don't like that I can't swap out a dying battery for a new one.. That being said, the 2180mAh battery in the Q5 is one of the largest to date in a BlackBerry and it's big enough that most days I don't need to worry about swapping a battery anyway. I found that it kept me going even on my busiest days and there were only a few times where I actually had to stop and plug in to charge which was awesome. I'd say it's a fair tradeoff in the end. As far as battery life goes on the Q5 I don't really have any complaints.. The Q5 is sporting 2GB of RAM which is on part with both the Q10 and Z10. So as you can imagine, the BlackBerry 10 OS runs very smooth and there is no lag when navigating around at all. Everything zips along and the Q5 has more than enough RAM to keep things going.. I do have to knock the Q5 for only having 8GB of internal storage. While it's not a deal-breaker, you'd expect a device to have at least 16GB of storage at this point. Granted you can use a memory card up to 32GB for storing media so in the end most users should have huge issues when it comes to internal storage.. I actually really like the feel of the Q5 as a phone. It fits well in the hand and doesn't feel too large for me as the Z10 does at times.. The phone screen offers up recent call history, a dial pad and phone contacts. Along the top are tabs for All, Missed and VVM. (providing you have it set up). One issue I have is that not all contacts with phone numbers appear in the contacts list within the phone app. This has been an issue in the OS for some time now that will hopefully get resolved in later builds.. I had no issues hearing the other party and I was told I sounded loud and clear as well.. The Q5 has the usual bag of connections that you'd expect including. Bluetooth, GPS, Wifi, NFC, DLNA and mobile hotspot. The good thing is that even though this is a lower-tier device, everything OS-wise is still in there. So no missing out on any connection features here.. Even if you opt to go with the Q5 over the Q10 or Z10 you'll still have all of the same features as the other devices.. When it comes to the OS on the Q5 there really isn't anything new here. The Q5 is running BlackBerry 10.1 and is the same as what's now (mostly) available on the Q10. OS 10.1 on the Q5 runs very smooth - I was actually impressed to see it run so well. Moving around the homescreen and going in and out of apps produced no lag and jumping into the Hub or using gestures was no different.. We won't get into more of the OS here as we covered it before in both our Z10 and Q10 reviews as well as our BlackBerry 10 review , so be sure to check those out for more as the Q5 OS is the same.. The Q5 has great battery life, fits well in hand, is very sturdy and works like a champ. BlackBerry World is getting bigger by the day and already has a huge selection of apps, games, movies, music and TV shows available for the. Thankfully BlackBerry is doing a great job of making nearly all. was first released there was a gap in content since developers hadn't made many of their apps available for the new device, so at first it was a struggle for new. owners to find everything they were looking for. the issue is mostly diminished as most content is widely available.. Of course if you do pick up a Q5 you'll want to grab some accessories to go along with it. We've already got some great items in stock with plenty more on the way. You can check out the latest headsets, cables, external batteries, car mounts and much more at ShopCrackBerry .. It's not the top quality of the BlackBerry. but it will still find it's place in many markets. I actually really enjoyed using it for the past few weeks. I've always been a big fan of the smaller devices and the physical keyboard, so the. is a good fit for me. I won't be making it my full-time device but I'll certainly revisit it from time to time. The Q5 has great battery life, fits well in hand, is very sturdy and works like a champ. I have to take points off for the lack of a removable battery, low resolution camera and lack of. The Q5 obviously won't be competing with more modern devices, but for BlackBerry users on a budget or those looking to get started with BlackBerry 10, the Q5. If you're going to spend the money though, I'd say take the jump and go with the Q10 though.. Keyboard is nice (for the most part). If you love a physical keyboard and are looking for an inexpensive alternative to the Q10, the Q5. Available in a variety of colors and at a more affordable price, the Q5 will find it's place among new users and emerging markets with no problem. It has a few downsides as we discussed but overall it's running the same BlackBerry 10 with nearly the same processing power as other devices, so you aren't really compromising too much in the long run by choosing the Q5. If price doesn't matter however, the Q10. are better phones for the money.. BlackBerry Q5 Topic Page BlackBerry Q5 Forum BlackBerry 10 Review BlackBerry 10 News BlackBerry 10 Forum.

The BlackBerry Q5 is an affordable BlackBerry 10 QWERTY smartphone. It features a QWERTY keyboard, 3.1" touchscreen and is offered in 4 colours - black, white, red, pink. Details regarding the hardware specs of the BlackBerry Q5 are scarce at the current moment.. BlackBerry Q5 Review BlackBerry Q5 manual BlackBerry Q5 benchmarks. OS: BlackBerry (10.3, 10.2, 10.1, 10). Dimensions: 4.72 x 2.60 x 0.43 inches (120 x 66 x 10.8 mm). Weight: 4.23 oz (120 g) the average is 5.6 oz (159 g). Display Physical size: 3.1 inches. Resolution: 720 x 720 pixels. Features: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor. Pixel density - The pixel density of a display represents the number of pixels over an area of one inch. It’s measured in “pixels per inch”, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.. Technology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.. Screen-to-body ratio - Shows what part of the frontal area of a phone its screen occupies.. Features: Digital image stabilization, Video calling. Aperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor. The smaller the number is, the bigger this opening is, allowing for more light to pass.. System chip - Most modern handsets use an advanced chip that includes many of the device’s hardware modules like the processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and sometimes even the wireless radio. This field shows what particular system chip (or System-on-a-Chip) is used in the phone.. Processor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device. Some more powerful smartphones use dual-core and quad-core processors designed to deliver greater performance.. Graphics processor - The graphics processor is important for the smooth operation of the system and especially in games and other applications that may involve complex graphics and animations.. System memory - System memory, or RAM memory is the type of memory that the device uses to temporarily store data from the OS or currently-running apps. The more RAM available to the device, the better the performance will be when multiple or heavier programs are running.. Built-in storage - Bigger storage capacity allows you to keep more content saved onto your device, such as more applications, photos or video. Games and video content typically take up the biggest amount of storage space.. Storage expansion - Some handsets allow you to expand their storage capacity by using a memory expansion card – most often microSD. Expansion memory is mostly suitable for media storage, such as photo, video or music content.. Talk time (3G): 12.50 hours the average is 19 h (1147 min). Stand-by time (3G): 14.0 days (336 hours) the average is 25 days (590 h). Capacity - The bigger, the better! However, battery capacity is not the only factor that has an effect on battery life. Those include the chipset in use, the software running on the device, as well as the consumer's unique usage pattern.. Multimedia Screen mirroring: DLNA, Wireless screen share. Features: Album art cover, Background playback. Cellular GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. UMTS: 850, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz. LTE (FDD): Bands 17, 5, 4, 2. Data: LTE Cat 3 (100/50 Mbit/s), HSDPA+ (4G) 42.2 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS. Other: NFC, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync. Positioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. The most common types are GPS and A-GPS.. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. “Assisted” means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization.. Availability Officially announced: 15 May 2013. FCC approval - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Every wireless phone device that is sold in the U.S. has to be tested and approved for sale by the FCC.. Date approved - Shows the date when the particular phone is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. FCC ID value - Shows the FCC Identifying value of the particular phone. FCC measured SAR - Working closely with federal health and safety agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy. These limits are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is a measure of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a mobile phone. The FCC requires cell phone manufacturers to ensure that their phones comply with these objective limits for safe exposure. Any cell phone at or below these SAR levels (that is, any phone legally sold in the U.S.) is a "safe" phone, as measured by these standards. The FCC limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg).. To see the full specifications with in-depth details click here..

BlackBerry Mobile commits to "at least" two new phones in 2018. This is probably the most important smartphone that BlackBerry will launch in 2013. You see, the Z10 and Q10 were designed for diehards, gadget lovers and those who desired a like-for-like replacement for their aging Bolds. Unfortunately for CEO Thorsten Heins, those people were never the total sum of RIM's (now BlackBerry's) customer base. After all, it was the budget-conscious crowd that embraced BBM to the point where London's 2011 civil unrest was nicknamed the " BlackBerry riots ," not to mention the company's popularity in the developing world. Given that the business most recently posted an $84 million quarterly loss and has only managed to ship 2.7 million BB10 devices, it'll be these customers, then, who the company will need to win back in order to keep its head above water. Unlike its struggling rivals, however, BlackBerry does have one thing its rivals do not: a pedigree in QWERTY keyboards that offer a real alternative to the legion of Android and Windows Phone touchscreens out there.. That's where the Q5 comes in -- a portrait QWERTY handset with a 3.1-inch display described as "youthful" and "fun," designed for markets outside of the US, with a variety of color options. But is that enough to tempt back the text addicts of Latin America and the disenfranchised voters of London? It's available for £320 ($490) off-contract in the UK, or free on plans from £21 ($32) per month, but is it enough of a handset to justify its mid-tier price? Can this form factor work in a world where even the cheapest phones can offer 4-inch, pixel-rich displays and broader app support? Is this the handset that BlackBerry needs, or the one it deserves? We could tell you at the top here, but that'd kinda negate the point of the following 2,613 words.. BlackBerry has resurrected the Curve range with a decent mid-range device. It’s just a shame the designers scrimped on the keyboard.. Hardware BlackBerry Q5 Dimensions 120mm x 66mm x 10.8mm (4.72 x 2.59 x 0.42 in) Weight 4.2 oz. (120 grams) Screen size 3.1 inches Resolution 720 x 720 (329 ppi) Screen type IPS LCD Battery 2,180mAh Internal storage 8GB External storage microSD (up to 64GB) Rear camera 5 MP AF f/2.4 Forward camera 2 MP Video capture 1080p (rear) 720p (forward) NFC Yes Radios Bluetooth 4.0 (LE) SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 CPU 1.2GHz dual-core RAM 2GB WiFi 802.11b/g/n Wireless charging No Operating system BlackBerry 10.1 Details correct as of July 2013 Keyboard Display Camera. Despite being part of BlackBerry's "Q" range of handsets, the Q5 bears little resemblance to the Q10 it's meant to sit beside. While the layout and button placement are the same, this really doesn't feel like a BlackBerry handset at all. On paper, the phone has nearly identical dimensions to its bigger brother, being only 0.8mm narrower and 0.45mm thicker. But in reality that difference is palpable. Despite being designed as an upgrade to the mid-range Curve models in the company's product range, the Q5 feels rounded, hefty compared to the Curve 9320.. Diehards will be surprised to see that the company has ditched the removable battery and glass-weave backing, opting instead for a matte plastic chassis. Users will now have to access the micro-SIM and microSD card slots via a flap that runs down the left-hand side, next to the micro-USB port. Up top, you've got a 3.5mm headphone jack nestled next to the display / power button. On the right is the three-way volume / mute rocker, which also doubles as the voice control and camera shutter switches. Meanwhile, the speaker runs along the bottom lip.. GSM (850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900). HSPA+ (DC 42 Mbps) 1, 2, 4, 5/6 (850 / 1900 / 1700 / 2100). LTE (100 / 50 Mbps) band 2, 4, 5, 17 (700 / 850 / 1700 / 1900). The BlackBerry logo sits between the 3.1-inch, 720 x 720 display and the island-style keyboard, saved from jostling for space with the speaker, 2-megapixel front-facing camera and LED light at the top of the unit. The square display means that consuming video content is a choice between heavy letter boxing or blowing the picture up and panning-and-scanning (with your finger) like the VHS tapes of yore. Flip the phone over and you'll see a plain back dominated by the "seven flying D's" symbol, set between the camera / LED flash and the removable FCC sticker. Internals-wise, the Q5 is packing 8GB of storage, of which 4.3GB is usable out of the box, so we'd suggest grabbing a microSD card (up to 64GB) if you're planning to use this as your primary media player.. Now we come to the keyboard, without doubt the single most important feature this phone has to offer. Our fingers may have lost their strength thanks to the softening effect of touchscreen devices, but we were excited to spend some time using a physical input device we could feel. Unfortunately, it looks as if this feature was the one where the company was most eager to differentiate the Q5 from its higher-priced sibling.. Swap out "Bold" for "Q10" and "Curve" for "Q5" and you've got exactly the same setup here.. Back in the day, BlackBerry's top-end Bold line had a sumptuous, confluent keyboard, while the budget range of Curve handsets had an island-style QWERTY layout that was nowhere near as comfortable to use. Swap out "Bold" for "Q10" and "Curve" for "Q5" and you've got exactly the same setup here. The membrane beneath the unit is sufficiently weak that when pushing down the F key, the G and R keys move along in sympathy. Now, while this problem doesn't create any accidental entries, these little flaws don't fill you with confidence in the hardware. In fact, we can only imagine how bad the materials will deteriorate at the tail end of a two-year deal. Furthermore, as the keys are nearly flush with the chassis, there's a limited amount of travel, but what little there is feels mushy and imprecise despite a mechanical click that lets you know you've landed. We should add, however, that we did put the Q5 in the hands of a BBM-addicted tween, who felt that the phone's keyboard was an improvement over the 9320, but they were the only one in our usual sample group who expressed anything other than annoyance at the keyboard's build.. This may be a little redundant in the modern age, but the tweaked fonts and subtler keying means that the numerical keypad (which sits inside the keys) has become very easy to miss. We're not sure if we'd like to see a return to the two-tone stylings of the Curve 8520, or the differently colored letters of the Bold 9650, but it does feel as if we're not expected to make any phone calls at all with this device.. We'll admit, it's been a very long time since we fixed our eyes on a 3.1-inch IPS LCD display for any meaningful period of time. Sadly, it's hard not to feel as if this is a regressive step, even if we can understand that it is the only way to accommodate the keyboard without adopting a slider mechanism. Unfortunately, the trade-off here is that everything's a little too cramped, with a claustrophobic environment that means even if you kick the font size down to 5pt, you'll only be able to see four or five emails per screen -- not to mention only being able to see one Facebook post at a time.. On the upside, the Q5 at least makes the best of its 720 x 720 screen, with a pixel density of 329 ppi to prove it's not the size, but the quality that counts. One thing we can't fault this phone for is the strength of its backlighting, which made things clearly readable in the harsh noonday sun even at half power. Then there are the strong viewing angles and the better color temperature compared to the Q10, so while we were wary of watching movies on this thing, it turned out to be a rather enjoyable experience nonetheless.. The Q5 comes with a 5-megapixel primary camera with a four-element, f/2.4 lens, plus 1080p video capture and the Scalado-powered Time Shift feature to help you correct errors in group photography. Before we talk specifics, however, it's worth mentioning two quirks in BB10's camera software that may blindside new users. First up, rather than tapping to focus, you've gotta drag around the targeting reticule in order to focus your images before pressing the screen (or the volume down button) to take the snap. Secondly, users can choose one of three aspect ratios for their images -- 1:1 is a square picture, which is equal to the Q5's screen with a relatively narrow focus. The 4:3 option crops off the lower quarter of the image and zooms out a little further, and 16:9, which heavily letterboxes the image, zooms out a fair way to give you a far greater depth of field..

The camera app is surprisingly powerful compared to Windows Phone and iOS 6, which will make you miss the absent first-party Instagram client that little bit less. There's a choice of creative photo filters, which you can add after the fact, adding sepia tinges -- there's even a high-contrast Whiteboard mode to preserve your dry-erase marker scrawls in preparation for next week's TPS report. Styles offer users the ability to add creative borders to their images and there's also a good set of editing tools including cropping, rotation, red-eye reduction and flipping. As the Q5 ships with BB 10.1, you have the ability to take HDR images, although it's important to keep the handset perfectly still when taking them, as it was pretty easy to create ghosted images if you're not careful. On the downside, there's no macro or panorama mode, which disappoints anyone who is looking to use this as a device that'll capture those special moments no matter the circumstance.. Gallery: BlackBerry Q5 HDR sample shots | 21 Photos. Software Performance and battery life The competition Wrap-up. The Q5's 5-megapixel camera is one of the better shooters we've tested over the last few months. On a bright summer's day, images come out with very little noise, along with plenty of detail and strong colors. However, while wandering around on an overcast afternoon, we found the grey skies tended to wash out colors. The HDR mode is similarly so-so, with strong daylight shots coming out really well, though, as we mentioned, be advised how still you have to stand, as even the slightest movement creates ghosting. Meanwhile, shots taken in weaker light are probably destined for your desktop's trash bin.. On the video front, users have a choice of recording clips at 720p or 1080p with an additional stabilization mode. When using this latter mode, we found that every now and again, the video would kick in odd ways as it tried to compensate for a dropped frame. As you can see in our sample footage, it's very much a fair-weather camera, producing serviceable clips with strong sound, but only when conditions are in its favor. Compare the daylight tromp to the journey in the tube and you'll see it struggled to maintain focus and produced grainy, blurred footage when indoors.. We won't cover the same ground here as in our BlackBerry 10 review, but we can talk about what this OS is like to use on a daily basis. The handset is running version 10.1, same as was found on the Q10 , which provided a number of minor tweaks including downloading email attachments, pin-to-pin messaging in BBM, pasting numbers into the dialer and HDR photography. Once you've gotten used to the gesture-based navigation system (up to return to the home screen, down for settings, left for your emails), getting around the device is pretty easy. In addition, thanks to its bigger bezel, it's actually easier to make the swipes compared to its comparatively cluttered bigger brother.. BlackBerry has also seen fit to add native Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare and LinkedIn apps to the home screen, as well as Box.net, Dropbox and Adobe Reader support for power users. On the downside, there's no native YouTube app; just a shortcut to the browser. The only other big differentiation point between BB10 and other operating systems is the hub -- the company's one-stop shop for your email, Twitter and everything else. If we're honest, we didn't enjoy using the hub, primarily because we prefer having our social feeds and our emails not intertwined as one, but we're sure plenty of business users will disagree with us.. The Q5 packs a dual-core 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 with 2GB of RAM, but as BB10 still lacks the requisite hardware-taxing benchmarking software we use on other platforms, we'll be relying upon web-based browser benchmarks and our general impressions in order to gauge how it'll behave on a day-to-day basis. Unfortunately, the hard numbers don't paint the Q5 in a very flattering light. With a SunSpider JavaScript benchmark of 1,916ms (lower is better), the handset lags well behind the 1,775ms of the Z10 and the Q10's score of 1,465ms. While we shouldn't expect it to be producing flagship-beating specs, the Q5 can't put up much of a fight compared to ultra-budget units like the 1,400ms Lumia 520 or HTC's 1,504ms One VX .. Like its bigger brothers, the Q5 comes with LTE bands 2, 4, 5 and 17 as well as HSPA+ and GSM/GPRS/EDGE, alongside its GPS, accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope and proximity sensors. Out here in the sticks, we weren't able to test the handset's LTE performance, but we found speeds were comparable to using other devices on Three UK's HSPA+ network. If you still use your phone to make calls, you'll find it adequate to the task, albeit with more distortion, clicks and compression than we're used to thanks to the coddling clarity of HD Voice.. Given that the Z10 and Q10 both suffered from slow boot-up times, we shouldn't be surprised to see an equally pedestrian situation here. The phone took one minute and 22 seconds to launch from cold and a further 30 seconds to completely shut down. Long story short is that you'll be turning this thing off well in advance of when the pilot asks you to shut off all electronic devices before takeoff, and you'll be the last one to receive calls when you disembark.. In our standard video rundown test, with the display set at 50 percent and WiFi on, the Q5 was able to last an impressive 12 hours and 34 minutes. We're big fans of gadgets with long battery lives, so this gets a big tick from us, even if we must attribute such longevity to the phone's undemanding 720 x 720 display. In the hands of a compulsive Twitter and email user like your humble narrator, we were able to abuse this handset for a full working day before resorting to a re-juice.. We guess there are three groups of people eyeing this as their next purchase. First up, if you're in the market for a BlackBerry 10 device, then you've got the choice of the Z10, the Q10 and... While there's a distinctly Z5-shaped hole in the company's product lineup, there's no way to tell if we'll see a low-end, full-size touchscreen coming out, or if it's just wishful thinking on our part. Naturally, we've reviewed both devices and the only meaningful difference between the two is if you prefer a physical keyboard or not.. On the other hand, QWERTY devotees looking for any handset might prefer to consider examples like Motorola's Droid 4 ($400), the Galaxy S Relay 4G ($300), NEC Terrain ($430) or, if money's tight, Nokia's Asha 210 ($80). Finally, if you're just looking for something priced in the sub-$500 range, you could snag an iPhone 4 ($450) or Galaxy S III ($430) for a similar price.. More Info BlackBerry Q5: a QWERTY handset built for emerging markets BlackBerry Q5 hands-on BlackBerry Q5 stops by the FCC with AT&T-friendly 3G. The BlackBerry Q5 isn't a bad handset, but it carries the weight of disappointment when you realize that it's not just a stripped-down Q10. Had it been, we'd probably be far more appreciative of the hardware, but as it stands we have two objections we simply can't get past. First things first , the price. We've labored this point already, but it's worth repeating that unless you specifically want a phone with a physical keyboard, for the same sort of money you can pick up a 2011 / 2012 flagship that'll pack more of a punch. Stick the Q5 beside a Galaxy S III and you can imagine who will come off the victor nine times out of 10.. Then there's the issue of the keyboard itself, which is terrible. Remember that having a physical keyboard and BlackBerry 10 at a mid-range price is the entire point of the Q5's existence, so why hobble it with a bad one? We have a sneaking belief that some executive, worried that using the company's premium keyboard would eat the Q10's lunch, insisted on resurrecting the island-style keys that plagued the Curve series. It's corporate cynicism of that caliber that means we're struggling to recommend the Q5 as your next smartphone.. blackberry , blackberryq5 , mobilepostcross , q5 , review , video.

Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Comment. For years, BlackBerry was prominently known as a device maker that focused on the enterprise segment. With cutthroat competition from the likes of Apple, Samsung and other handset makers that made Android devices, BlackBerry made a move for the emerging markets, leveraging its messaging platform and making economy devices under its Curve series targeted at youngsters. The company's Curve series did exceedingly well and gave BlackBerry a share in the Indian market. In 2013, a time when BlackBerry is reinventing itself after a massive overhaul led by BlackBerry 10, the company is launching new devices across different segments. After BlackBerry Z10 , its full-touch smartphone, and BlackBerry Q10 , a premium hardware keyboard equipped device, it's now looking at capturing the mid-range segment with the new BlackBerry Q5. Unlike its two BlackBerry 10 predecessors, the BlackBerry Q5 doesn't feature premium materials, sports inferior hardware specifications and less internal storage, but runs the same OS and delivers the same software features. After being widely panned for the pricing of its first two BlackBerry 10 smartphones, will BlackBerry be able to capture the attention of the Indian consumer with the Q5? We try to find out in our review. Build/ Design The BlackBerry Q5 doesn't resemble the company's Curve series smartphones, a major reason for which is the inclusion of a bigger 3.1-inch touch enabled display. The phone is taller and less curved, and looks more playful than the BlackBerry Q10, which has a more serious appeal targeting business users. However, the Q5 also looks more plasticky, which is fair enough since BlackBerry's aim was to cut costs. Just like the Q10, the front of the BlackBerry Q5 features a square screen that measures 3.1-inch on the diagonal and the 35 key keyboard in addition to the 2-megapixel front facing camera, the notification LED and an array of sensors, sitting above the display. The keyboard reminds us of the BlackBerry Curve phones, except that the keys on the BlackBerry Q5 are arranged in a more linear fashion and are spaced out. The keys offer good tactile feedback and are large enough for convenient and quick typing. Unlike the Q10's keys that are soft to press, the Q5's keys produce a 'clickety' sound and offer a great typing experience. Unlike legacy BlackBerry devices, the Q5 does not include any extra hardware keys for navigating through the phone, or for accepting and rejecting calls, giving the display area more space. Also, since the BlackBerry 10 OS relies a lot on swipe gestures, there's plenty of room to swipe into and out of the screen. The BlackBerry Q5 doesn't come with a non-removable back cover, though at first glance it was hard to realise this as there's demarcation between the back and front panels. On the right side of the phone, you will find the Volume rocker keys with a Mute key sitting between. The keys are made of plastic and feel a little cheap, though they offer good tactile feedback. There's a flap that covers the Micro-SIM and the microSD card slot located at the left hand side with the Micro-USB port. We found the flap to be a little flimsy and even after closing, the flap did not get tightly secured with the phone. The Power/ Screen-lock key, 3.5mm headset jack and a secondary noise cancellation microphone sit at the top of the phone, while the speaker outlet and the primary microphone are located at the bottom of the phone. Turning towards the back, the BlackBerry Q5 features a plastic panel with matte finish. The BlackBerry logo in silver sits at the middle, while the 5-megapixel rear camera lens and an LED flash are at the top left. The back is prone to smudges. Display The BlackBerry Q5 offers a 3.1-inch (diagonal) square shaped screen. Unlike the Q10 that comes with a Super AMOLED display, this one is an IPS LCD screen that offers a resolution of 720x720 pixels and pixel density of 329ppi. The screen packs in few more pixels per inch than the iPhone 5 (326ppi) and text, images and videos appear extremely sharp and clear. It offers excellent viewing angles and good sunlight legibility. However, the screen's 1:1 ratio makes watching videos feel awkward as most HD videos have a 16:9 ratio, and appear smaller. We also compared the screen with that of the Samsung Galaxy S III, and found it to be less bright. Perhaps this is a deliberate move from BlackBerry in a bid to conserve battery life. Overall, due to its small size and awkward screen ratio, the BlackBerry Q5 is not great if you want to primarily use the phone for accessing multimedia content. Software/ User Interface The Q5 has a hardware keyboard and runs BlackBerry OS 10.1, just like the BlackBerry Q10. As we mentioned in our Q10 review , BlackBerry has made some changes to the operating system (when compared to what we saw in the Z10) in order to add support for the QWERTY keyboard and include some new features that make full use of the hardware. The Q5 comes with BlackBerry OS 10.1, which is a small yet important update to the first version of the OS but the basics remain almost the same and you can have a detailed look at the operating system in our BlackBerry 10 OS review. In terms of the look and feel, the updated OS looks pretty similar to its earlier version. The OS on the Q5, though, is a little different than what we saw on the Q10, and doesn't include the new dark theme in native applications like the call logs and contacts screen, though it's still present in the system-wide sharing menu. The phone features smaller active frames in the running apps panel of the home screen. The navigation remains the same incorporating all the swipe gestures we have seen earlier in BlackBerry 10 on the Z10 and the Q10. Unlocking the screen takes you to a list of app icons arranged in a 4x3 grid. You can swipe to the right to continue exploring them or to the left to go to the BlackBerry Hub that collates all your messages, emails, WhatsApp and BBM chats, Facebook and Twitter notifications, Voicemail, call logs and even PIN to PIN messages. After opening an app, the only way to close it is to swipe from the bottom of the screen and you'll see that the app gets minimized to a small pane that offers a preview of the app's screen or even acts like a widget offering key information from the app. All these active panes or frames are displayed in a screen panel between the Hub and the app icon lists. This panel can have a maximum of 8 active frames and on Q5's display you'll need to swipe down to see all of them. Swiping up from any screen gives you a peek into your notifications, though it's still not detailed and just comes with the number of unread items and the red and white star if there are new items. Swiping up and immediately swiping to the right takes you to the BlackBerry Hub. BlackBerry OS 10.1 offers some additional functions on the BlackBerry Q5 and Q10. The phone offers Instant Action, which is a sort of advanced universal search (Mac users, think Spotlight) combined with actionable commands, making full use of the phone's keyboard. You just need to start typing what you want to do on the home screen and the phone gives you options to complete the task in addition to a list of search results that feature the keyword. For example, if you start keying in 'tweet' followed by what you want to post on Twitter, the phone will give you a compose window within the search for posting the same without going to the Twitter app in addition to search results that contain all emails, reminders and other content that features the word 'tweet'. Similarly, the phone offers actions for writing mails, SMS, BBM messages, playing music and videos, Facebook status updates and setting a reminder or jotting a note in the Remember app though the feature along with search results. We found this to be very convenient and a great way of getting to what we wanted. Just like the legacy BlackBerry OS versions, BlackBerry 10.1 also offers keyboard shortcuts and even lists them in some system menus. The OS offers about 200 such shortcuts. For instance you can use the 'T' key to go to the top of the list and 'B' key to get to the bottom. Similarly, you can go to the next message in the BlackBerry Hub by pressing the 'N' key, reply by pressing 'R', and reply all by pressing 'L' among others. Combine that with the physical keyboard and hard-core BlackBerry users will feel right at home. While the BlackBerry Z10 keyboard offered a unique way to input text through a touchscreen, the Q5, just like the Q10, offers a more conventional mode. You can configure the phone to show three word predictions while entering text, although the option is not turned on by default. It also learns new words and offers them as suggestions when you type. We observed that it was able to catch Hindi words typed in English ('Hinglish' if you will) over our course of using the phone. The software experience offered by the BlackBerry Q5 is similar to the Q10. You can read our detailed review of the BlackBerry Q10 to know about other changes and improvements that the BlackBerry 10.1 OS brings to the table. Camera The BlackBerry Q5 sports a 5-megapixel rear camera and a 2-megapixel front facing camera. The phone's camera app comes with limited number of settings. It offers three shooting modes namely, Still, Video and Timeshift. In the Still mode the phone offers options to shoot in Normal, Stabilisation, Burst and HDR modes. You can select between Auto, Action, Whiteboard, Night and Beach or Snow scenes. You can also choose if you want to take 1:1 square photos or photos in 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratios. You can also choose default storage and toggle geo-tagging. The video camera also offers Normal and Stabilisation shooting modes, Auto, Night and Beach or Snow scenes and choice between 1080p and 720p resolution. The Timeshift mode allows you to take 11 photos in quick succession and choose the best one depending on the settings and the expression on the subject's face through a slider photo picker. The front camera is capable of recording 720p video. The BlackBerry Q5 takes good quality shots in daylight and in good indoor lighting conditions. The photos taken with the phone look rich and offer a decent amount of detail, though when zoomed in to 100 percent we did notice minor noise. However, images taken in medium to low light conditions with the night mode on and without flash, were very grainy. Colour reproduction was mostly accurate, though. The rear camera of the BlackBerry Q5 is equally competent at recording videos and supports recording resolutions up to 1080p. The front camera is good for video chats and for clicking self portraits. Overall, the Q5 is good for casual photography. Performance/ Hardware The BlackBerry Q5 features a 1.2GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor, 2GB RAM, and 8GB of internal storage expandable up to 32GB via microSD card, which is a significant upgrade on the legacy Curve devices. With BlackBerry 10.1, the overall experience of navigating through the interface was impressive. The phone is extremely responsive and we did not experience any lags while opening apps, navigating the menu, browsing the web on the phone's native web browser and even playing games such as Angry Birds Star Wars, Beach Buggy Blitz and The Odyssey. The BlackBerry 10 user interface offers a user interface that's extremely fluid. Gone are the days when your BlackBerry phone used to reboot after installing and even updating individual apps. You'll not see the spinning clock or hourglass on your screen and wait for your phone to perform its assigned task with the BlackBerry 10. The native web browser comes with Adobe Flash and renders web pages swiftly. We were able to play full-HD clips, with most formats including MOV and AVI being supported natively, though some formats like MKV did not play. Videos do tend to look a little odd due to the screen's awkward 1:1 ratio. The speaker outlet on the phone delivers good quality sound at high volume levels thanks to the placement of the speaker outlet, though it's a little inferior compared to the BlackBerry Q10. Call quality was very good and the phone is able to latch on to cellular networks even in weak signal areas. We also got HD Voice at certain times with our mobile operator, Airtel. The phone lacks FM radio functionality, which will surely disappoint many, especially in our Indian audience. We were also able to transfer images and other content using NFC between the BlackBerry Q5 and the Samsung Galaxy S III , easily. Unlike its more expensive cousins, the BlackBerry Q5 does not feature a micro-HDMI port. The BlackBerry Q5 comes with a 2180mAh battery, and in our usage, it lasted us more than a full workday. We charged the phone in the morning, and with medium to heavy usage, including 1-1.5 hours of phone calls, two email accounts, playing some music, gaming, taking some photographs, Twitter notifications, BBM and WhatsApp chats, the phone lasted a good 13-14 hours. It's worth pointing out that we had turned off Wi-Fi and auto-brightness, and the phone was hooked to a 3G network with the screen brightness at the highest level. Altering these settings might help in running the phone for a longer duration, depending on your usage pattern. Verdict The BlackBerry Q5 is a great keyboard equipped smartphone. In fact, it's the only smartphone in the price bracket that comes with a hardware keyboard. Having said that, it becomes a little difficult to recommend this phone to anyone who is not looking for a QWERTY keyboard and doesn't make heavy use of messaging features majorly because of what's being offered by other handset makers at this price point. However, the device will definitely appeal to BlackBerry fans looking for a cheaper alternative to the Q10. BlackBerry is targeting a different demographic with this phone. It's not business users, but young professionals and college students who are being eyed by the company. Unfortunately for the company, these customers are extremely price conscious and want full value for their money. With BBM's declining popularity, and the fact that it's even available on OS 7 phones (soon to be available on iOS and Android as well) that are priced much cheaper, there's little chance that people will buy this phone just for its messaging capabilities. There's no doubt that the Q5, despite being a mid-ranger, offers all major features with an operating system that's extremely responsive. There's no software fragmentation here, unlike other platforms, and the Q5 runs all apps that the Q10 can. However, it's worth pointing out that a lot of BlackBerry 10 apps made for the Z10 have still not been optimized for the Q5 and the Q10, and are not available in BlackBerry World, yet. The BlackBerry Q5 also comes with plenty of power under the hood, so you don't experience the slightest of lag. Of course, the swipe gestures that are part of the OS might take some time to get used to but once you get hooked to them, it's difficult to go back. As we mentioned earlier, at a price of Rs. 24,990, we feel that the phone is a little overpriced especially when one looks at what's available in the market at the same price point. BlackBerry 10 is also lacking in terms of the available apps on the platform. If you're fine with a device that doesn't have a physical keyboard, you should check out devices in the same price range such as the Nexus 4, the Galaxy S III and the HTC One X. You can even look at the Nokia Lumia 720, which is a great phone that costs less. If you want a QWERTY device and don't want to spend a large amount of cash, you could consider BlackBerry OS 7 devices like the Curve 9320 and Curve 9360, which are still selling and will continue to be supported by the company.

CNET también está disponible en español.. The Good Sharp, bright screen; Comfortable physical keyboard; Decent battery life.. The Bad Too expensive; BlackBerry 10 software is far from perfect; App store is miserably empty; key specs won't trouble most Android phones.. The Bottom Line The BlackBerry Q5 has a bright, sharp screen and its physical keyboard will certainly appeal to dedicated BlackBerry fans. Its software still leaves much to be desired though, the app store is miserable, and at £320, it's not the budget BlackBerry we were hoping for.. Visit manufacturer site for details.. Should I buy the BlackBerry Q5?. Here's where you put your SIM and microSD cards. The gaps help you type without looking, but the keys could do with sticking out more. The Q5 (right) doesn't have the classy metal fret or curved edges of the Q10.. With financial losses , plummeting stock prices and ridiculous statements from its boss , BlackBerry hasn't had a good time of things lately. Its BlackBerry 10 software was supposed to be its big comeback. It arrived much later than expected though, and brought with it an all-touchscreen phone, the Z10 .. Hardcore BlackBerry fans were appalled at the lack of the physical keyboard, and the rest of the world was unimpressed. The Q10 brought back the keyboard, but came at a sky-high price.. The Q5 is pitched as the more affordable BlackBerry. It sports the latest software, a good screen and that all-important physical Qwerty keyboard. With a price tag of £320 though, it's hardly for the budget-minded.. The Q5 is available now on deals from £26 per month .. With its plain, plastic design, 5-megapixel camera and 1.2GHz dual-core processor, the BlackBerry Q5 is undeniably a budget phone. It's annoying, then, that it comes with a not-so-budget £320 price tag.. Like the Q10, it has a physical keyboard, satisfying the last few of you clinging on to your old BlackBerry Bold as though your life depends on it. It has the same good screen as the Q10 too. If you absolutely must have a phone with a physical keyboard, the Q5 and the Q10 are the only two worth considering. With its lower price, but similar specs, the Q5 represents better value for money.. It's far from impressive in most respects, however. The software is frustrating, the camera isn't great, the processor is more suited to a bottom-end Android phone and the app store is as barren as the moon. Spend the same money on an Android or even Windows Phone device and you'll be able to snag a much more enjoyable piece of kit.. To look at, there's no mistaking that the Q5 is the cheaper sibling of the Q10. It's an entirely plastic phone with a very plain black design. It has a square 3.1-inch screen with the physical keyboard sitting beneath. The corners are much more square than the Q10's rounded design -- whether that's good or not is up to you.. The Q5 certainly doesn't have the same design flair as its brother. There are no sleek metal frets between the rows of keys. The back is simply a plain expanse of black plastic -- a step down from the fancy Kevlar weave on the Q10.. It definitely doesn't look nearly as luxurious as the Q10. If you want to whip a phone out of your pocket that will raise approving eyebrows around the boardroom table, the Q5 isn't the fellow for you. As a budget blower, its functional looks would just about be acceptable, but it's not quite cheap enough to get away with such a stripped-down design.. The plastic body feels fairly tough though. You won't be hammering nails in with it, but I doubt it will shatter into a million tiny pieces the first time you drop it, either. The back case isn't removable like the Q10's, so your SIM card and microSD card slots are found under a small flap on the side. This feels very weak and liable to snap off if you get it caught, so I suggest always making sure it's fully closed before cramming it into your pocket.. The sealed design also means you can't remove the battery. That's bad news, clearly, for those of you who like to carry an emergency battery for long days away from a plug. You'll spy the power button and 3.5mm headphone jack on top of the phone, with the micro-USB port on the left-hand side. There's no micro-HDMI port like on the Q10, so you won't be able to hook it up to a big TV.. It's 120m long and 66mm wide, making it perfectly comfortable to hold in one hand. It's 10.8mm thick though, which is definitely on the chunky side for a smart phone. At 10.3mm, the Q10 is roughly the same. If you want the slimmest phone for your skinny jeans, Huawei's Ascend P6 is a ludicrous 6.2mm.. Classic BlackBerry fans will be pleased to see the physical Qwerty keyboard is present and correct. Like the Q10, the keys are laid out in straight, rather than curved lines. There's no stylish metal fret between each row, but there is still a gap that helps your fingers identify separate rows without you needing to look.. Unlike the Q10, there are gaps between each individual key which should help make them easier to feel by touch alone. They sit quite flush with the surrounding plastic though, which negates most of the benefit. They're also quite a bit smaller that the Q10s, which won't be comfortable if you've got huge fingers.. I found both fairly comfy to type on, but it's difficult to say which is best as it really depends on what you're used to. I'd recommend getting your hands on both models to see which you prefer.. Unless you're totally committed to sticking with Qwerty keyboards though, I'd suggest trying to get used to touchscreen keyboards -- the BlackBerry Z10 is fully touch-enabled if you want to stick with BlackBerry phones. Yes, you don't have the tactile feedback of a physical keyboard, but the benefits make up for that. For a start, the screen can be made bigger to take up the whole of the phone.. An onscreen keyboard is also able to change depending on context -- tapping to enter a phone number on a shopping site will automatically bring up the number keypad, for example. Entering characters is also easier as you don't need to have to press an 'alt' button before pressing a key.. Hot Products. The first great smartphone of 2015.

The source for Tech Buying Advice. More Car Tech. Tech deals, prizes and latest news. BlackBerry 10 gets slightly more affordable, but does that make any better?. The BlackBerry Q5 is difficult to love. Sure it's got all the core smartphone features, but it doesn't really excel at anything, apart from perhaps web browsing, but even that's hampered somewhat by the pokey 3.1-inch display. It's a Q10 for people who can't afford one.. BlackBerry 10 gets ever so slightly more affordable with the introduction of the BlackBerry Q5 to the Canadian firm's smartphone lineup. But don't go thinking this is a bargain basement offering, because it carries a mid to high tier price tag.. Unveiled at BlackBerry's annual Live conference in Orlando in May 2013, the BlackBerry Q5 was hotly rumoured under the moniker BlackBerry R10, and while the name was a bit of a surprise at launch, pretty much every other detail had been leaked correctly.. It slides in below the fully touchscreen BlackBerry Z10 and its keyboard brethren the BlackBerry Q10 , perhaps in a vague attempt to catch the eye of the Curve generation.. What you get on the BlackBerry Q5 is the same, oddly proportioned 3.1-inch, 720p IPS LCD display you find on the BlackBerry Q10, 1.2GHz dual-core processor, 2GB of RAM, microSD slot, 5MP rear camera, 2MP front camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC , 4G and a 2180mAh battery.. Of course below that rather square screen you'll also find a 35-key physical QWERTY keyboard, which sports isolated keys instead of the side by side layout on the BlackBerry Q10.. In terms of price the BlackBerry Q5 is going to cost around £330 (around US$500 / AU$550) SIM-free, which puts it up against the likes of the Sony Xperia SP , Motorola Razr HD , Huawei Ascend P6 and Nokia Lumia 720 .. Look the BlackBerry Q5 up and down and it's immediately obvious that this isn't a premium device, with a sizeable bezel above and below the screen, and then a chunk of plastic below the keyboard too.. The additional space below the display is actually not a bad thing though, as the upwards swipe required to close applications is made easier with this gap - something that was sorely missing from the Q10.. Pick the Q5 up and its plastic body is very noticeable. It does feel solid, but at the same time the matt gloss plastic rear and chunky dimensions of 120 x 66 x 10.8mm (4.7 x 2.6 x 0.4 inches) do take you back a few years to BlackBerry phones of old.. At 120g (4.2oz) the Q5 is suitably weighted, thankfully, because if it was nearer the 100g (3.5oz) mark you might mistake this for a toy - which isn't totally out of the question anyway.. BlackBerry has said that the Q5 is targeted at the younger generation who generally share content, like to be connected with mates and want their own freedom - although it's not exactly the handset you can see kids showing off to their friends.. The back looks like it should come off, but it doesn't - honest. We were fooled when we saw the Q5 at BlackBerry Live in May, but after a few minutes of trying to yank it apart we were politely told it wasn't possible, so don't bother.. There's no access to that battery then, and when it comes to the micro SIM and microSD slots, you'll find a flap on the left of the handset covering both ports.. We have a couple of bug bears with this set up. Firstly the flap itself, while easy to remove and replace, doesn't exactly fill us with confidence that it will actually protect our cards, or at least keep out some dust.. Push the flap in and it makes a satisfying clicking sound, suggesting you've snapped it snugly into place, but apply the lightest amount of pull to the top and it comes away easily from the BlackBerry Q5, and we can see this filling up with dust and dirt quickly.. Secondly, there's not a great deal of instruction about which way around you should insert the cards, and you'll need at least some finger nails to pop them into place.. Up top you get a headphone jack and the now common-place centralised power/lock key, but unlike the metallic finish found on the BlackBerry Z10 and BlackBerry Q10, the BlackBerry Q5 has been lumbered with a plastic button.. There's more plastic on the right, with the trio of buttons comprising a voice command key sandwiched in between volume rockers.. All are easy to hit with one-handed operation, but it's disappointing that BlackBerry couldn't treat us to at least a little bit of metal.. On the base is a central speaker grille, but no micro USB slot, which is found on the left at the top of the handset - one of our least favourite positions, since it makes it difficult to handle the Q5 when plugged in.. Sure the BlackBerry Q5 comes in some slightly more entertaining colours other than black - you can also pick from white, red and pink - but at the end of the day it's not particularly desirable in terms of looks.. Perhaps we could have overlooked the various design niggles on the BlackBerry Q5 if it sported a more reasonable price tag, but seeing as it doesn't and looking at its competition it's hard not to feel a little cheated here..

I cover mobile hardware, software and gaming. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.. The Q5 is now launching in emerging markets - and at a price level that is raw folly. After the May quarter volume disappointment, it seems highly likely that BlackBerry priced the Q10 and Z10 too high. What the company needs is a staunch Curve upgrade; a cheap, cheerful smartphone that would shore up BlackBerry's position in Middle East, Africa and South-East Asia. Africa is crucial to BlackBerry; it held more than 50% of the smartphone share in rapidly growing markets like South Africa and Nigeria as recently as in 2012. If BlackBerry Messenger is to have any future as a messaging platform, it rests on BB10 devices maintaining a very high market share in countries like Nigeria, UAE, Malaysia and Philippines. Now that a horde of messaging apps like WeChat, Kik and LINE is taking off in these very markets, BlackBerry can ill afford any further slippage of its hardware share. 's Windows models are threatening to undermine the network effect that created the self-sustaining loop between BBM usage and BlackBerry buying in emerging markets.. The only way BlackBerry can retain a viable smartphone platform is to sell devices that are competitive in emerging markets where smartphone usage is now spreading to middle class from the narrow slice of the most affluent consumers. And this is why the Q5 pricing is so astounding. In Nigeria, one of BlackBerry's cornerstone markets, the device is now launching at 65'000 nairas - more than $400. This is just 27% below the price of a Samsung Note II - a premium luxury device.. The Q5 is priced more than 100% above the price of a LG Optimus L5 II, a model with a 4 inch display and a 5 MP rear camera. It is 400% above the price of a Nokia Asha 200, a QWERTY feature phone that effectively mimics many BlackBerry features with a cheap hardware build.. Of course, the Q5 is going to sell well in places like Nigeria for a few weeks or a month as it taps into the old, affluent, urban user base it used to dominate. But holding a portion of that base is nowhere close to what BlackBerry needs to achieve right now. The company absolutely must make inroads into the middle classes and rural consumers that are the new source of growth in the smartphone markets of Nigeria, Malaysia and Philippines. Those consumers are now captivated by the smartphone war between Nokia's $100 Asha phones and $150 low-end Lumias vs. Asian Android devices in the same price points. That $100-200 war raging on in emerging markets is where the volume growth of this business is taking place. Trying to take the high road with a $400 "value" model is lunacy. That price point worked well in 2010 when high-end BlackBerries commanded unsubsidized prices of $600-700 with ease. Those days are gone; BlackBerry needs to duplicate Nokia's aggressive low-end Lumia strategy as of now. The problem is that the company may not have anything in its near term product road map that fits the bill.. The upcoming budget iPhone could deal a truly devastating blow against this $400 BlackBerry. The time to launch a truly competitive, sub-$250 model is running out..

BlackBerry will pay Nokia $137 million over a contract. Posted Jun 30, 2013 by Natasha Lomas ( @riptari ). In some ways the Qwerty-packing Q5, with its throwback BlackBerry looks, is a far more important device for. BlackBerry than its current flagship, the all-touch Z10. Or the premium-priced Qwerty-clad Q10. Q5 should be priced to shift — because that’s what BlackBerry needs to happen to start regaining the ground it lost when it was forced to pause and reboot its OS to play catch-up with rivals. That’s what the Q5 should do, but will it?. The problem for BlackBerry is it may already be too late to turn things around. BlackBerry’s latest results, out late last week , made grim reading as the company missed analyst expectations, and its share price took a battering. It shipped just 2.7 million BlackBerry 10 handsets in its Q1. But it has only had two BB10 devices to sell, one of which (the Q10) only made it to market in the U.S. Which makes the Q5 even more important: BlackBerry needs more handsets in its portfolio attacking different price points to have a chance of ramping up sales.. The problem is the Q5 doesn’t feel like a saviour. It feels closer to a kludge. Likely it isn’t going to be cheap enough to really hit Android where it hurts (it’s mid-tier, not budget after all). Nor does it feel like enough of a leap forward to convert a new generation of users to BlackBerry. BB10 is still Blackberry playing catch-up with competitors, rather than streaking ahead in the innovation stakes.. Of course many Blackberry loyalists and long-time users aren’t going to be unhappy with the Q5’s old school Qwerty form factor. But that staid staple means it necessarily offers a crimped OS experience versus the full-touch Z10. On the Q5 — as with the Q10 — the touchscreen has had to be squashed into a square to accommodate yesteryear’s physical Qwerty keys. BlackBerry’s new platform needs room for the user to manoeuvre.. BB10 is built around gestures and layering content — and that whole “peek and flow” dynamic comes into its own on a full touchscreen. But on the Q5’s small square it’s inevitably constrained. Yet, despite this squeezed screen, the Q5 is surprisingly big for a Qwerty BlackBerry. Certainly compared to past generations of RIM hardware — those ever-so-popular Curves and Bolds it apparently succeeds.. As well as being constrained by having to make room for the keyboard, space has to be found to accommodate the bevels where BB10’s gestures have to start. This makes the overall front footprint a bit, well, hefty. It looks like an oversized, top-heavy BlackBerry, which will feel like a step backwards to those accustomed to BlackBerry’s traditionally highly pocketable handsets. And who else is this Qwerty-packer really trying to woo?. Android users have so much choice when it comes to keyboard software that even if they don’t get on with the stock Android virtual keyboard they can switch to Swype, or Swiftkey or any one of the growing number of Qwerty alternatives cooking up interesting new ways to type .. The Q5’s immutable plastic keys feel terribly dumb phone in comparison.. Even the BlackBerry exec demoing the Q5 at the press event I attended to pick up a review device described the physical keyboard as “infamous”. And said he found typing on it “a bit strange” because “I’m used to typing on the [full touchscreen] Z10.” That says it all really.. The Q5 is a deeply conservative device. It continues to look backwards to BlackBerry’s legacy keyboard-chained past — a compromise between old technology and new software. And like most compromises, it’s unlikely to entirely please anybody. It’s not that it’s terrible, it just doesn’t feel good enough to make an impact — and that means it’s not good enough because BlackBerry needs something remarkable to stand out in this crowded mid-tier segment.. Yet you can see exactly how and why BlackBerry has arrived here. In its current shrunken state, as its user base and revenues have diminished, the company has had to retrench. It can’t afford to lose any more users, yet it can’t afford to ramp up the number of devices in its portfolio quickly enough — making it super important that it retains its one remaining heartland: corporate users. Those are the last really sticky BlackBerry users, even as fickle consumers have wandered off elsewhere.. So BlackBerry can’t cut its ties with the past as it’s now even more dependent on its most conservative demographic. Its focus has to be on servicing that existing corporate user-base — because their loyalty is locked up far more than the average consumer.. Some 90 percent of the Fortune 500 are BlackBerry customers, according to the company. And some 60 percent are apparently trialling BB10.. BlackBerry needs those bulk-buyers to migrate to BB10 and continue pumping money into its coffers. If they abandon ship BlackBerry really will be an adrift ghost ship.. Selling mobile email to corporates is how BlackBerry built its original mobile empire. And selling to corporates is where BlackBerry has had to retrench to now. An army of cheap Androids is sweeping away its other former stronghold: teens. While free, over-the-top messaging apps like WhatsApp have eroded the appeal of BBM (BlackBerry’s licensing of BBM to Android and iOS this summer also feels like too little, too late). Now, with the mid-tier-priced Q5, BlackBerry is apparently hoping to woo those kids back.. But the Q5 compromises on target demographic, too.. says it’s aiming the Q5 at younger users. But it also cites SMEs and corporates as targets — flagging up the Balance feature that allows segmentation of work and personal content on the device. Little wonder then that, design-wise, the Q5 looks like it’s trying not to be too much of anything, so no one feels like disowning it. If I had to use one word to describe it, it would be generic. It’s as if it’s been deliberately left as blank as possible to be as inoffensive as possible — to try to appeal to as wide a group as possible.. The other problem BlackBerry has is that corporates are famously conservative about technology upgrades, which explains why. it has no plans to sunset BB 7 any time soon. Corporate investments in BES 7 “have to be protected,” as one BlackBerry spokesman put it. Which means the company has to keep supporting BB 7 and producing devices running that last-gen OS for the foreseeable future. Which stymies change, and hampers BB10’s progress as a portion of resources have to go on the old platform.. Plus, if BB 7 devices are still on offer, why should corporates risk the upheaval of upgrading to a device like the Q5? They’ll stick with what they know, and leave this compromise on the shelf.. So while BlackBerry youth users are going — or have already gone — elsewhere to check out shinier hardware, its business users are foot-dragging and in no hurry to move on. Talk about being stuck between a rock and a hard place. No wonder turning this tanker is so hard.. Pricing will of course play a key role in whether the Q5 sits on shelves or not. The mid-tier is where the largest Android army roams. But carrier tariffs for the Q5 are going to need to be a lot lower than the early EE pricing of £26 a month to be competitive enough to win over consumers. That price is pitting the Q5 against iPhone 4S or Galaxy S3 tariff prices. Which makes BlackBerry’s mid-tier offering a tough sell, whichever tech camp you prefer to sit in.. Regardless of whether this middling handset ends up selling well or not, it may make little material difference to BlackBerry’s prospects. The perception that the mobile maker is now locked in a death spiral will only increase shareholder pressure on the management team, and make acquisition a more likely end. BlackBerry would need to sell an awful lot of Q5s to calm that spin.. BlackBerry provides wireless devices and solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market. It is widely known for the development of the Blackberry smartphone..

Share your thoughts with other customers. There was a problem filtering reviews right now. 5.0 out of 5 stars Need of the hour is BlackBerry Phones.. Using it sine Feb 2015 and still giving the same performance after 20 months. I am using Blackberry devices since 2008. with BB10 OS its functionality reached at its peak. no other OS can come in front of Blackberry. Secure Emails be it business or personal, its the core of BB devices. In current world, where all the forgot password links and credit card bills & almost everything comes in your personal mail box. you need to feel secure, & BB devices gives that security feeling and trust. But with BB10 OS you can easily use most of the android apps. We are hearing iPhones getting bend, Samsung phones battery getting exploded, but have anybody heard the same about BlackBerry? Never about BB devices, because their focus is on QUALITY & not minting money from public. wake up android guys, app is not the world end. & how many apps we actually use in our phones? max 20. rest we just download & keep it there. One more point, IOS & Android Apps are real big in size, they also required higher data usage in real use. but with Blackberry app sizes are really small. Whats app app download size in BlackBerry is just 22 MB, but in android its 66 MB(Varies with device you use) & IOS its 92.7 MB. Note: My Q5 gives almost 24 hours of battery backup even after 20 months. As you may be reading news about Whats app revoking support for Blackberry OS. no worries with BB10 OS devices you can easily use whats app for android in your BlackBerry, without any problem. My next phone will be Classic or Passport.. Was this review helpful to you?. 3.0 out of 5 stars just fine..
